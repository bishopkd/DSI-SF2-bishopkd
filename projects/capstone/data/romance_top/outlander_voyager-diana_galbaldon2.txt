There were feuds at the moment; hed settled Bobby Sinclair and Edwin Murrays trouble a week back, and while they were not friends, they were keeping their distance from one another.He closed his eyes.He was tired; he had been hauling stone all day.Supper would be along in a few minutesa tub of parritch and some bread to be shared out, a bit of brose too if they were luckyand likely most of the men would go to sleep soon after, leaving him a few minutes of peace and semiprivacy, when he need not listen to anyone or feel he must do anything.He had had no time as yet even to wonder about the new Governor, important as the man would be to all their lives.Young, Hayes had said.That might be good, or might be bad.Older men who had fought in the Rising were often prejudiced against HighlandersBogle, who had put him in irons, had fought with Cope.A scared young soldier, though, trying to keep abreast of an unfamiliar job, could be more rigid and tyrannical than the crustiest of old colonels.Aye well, and nothing to be done but wait to see.He sighed and shifted his posture, incommodedfor the ten thousandth timeby the manacles he wore.He shifted irritably, banging one wrist against the edge of the bench.He was large enough that the weight of the irons didnt trouble him overmuch, but they chafed badly with the work.Worse was the inability to spread his arms more than eighteen inches apart; this gave him cramp and a clawing feeling, deep in the muscle of chest and back, that left him only when he slept.Mac Dubh, said a soft voice beside him.A word in your ear, if I might?He opened his eyes to see Ronnie Sutherland perched alongside, pointed face intent and foxlike in the faint glow from the fire.Aye, Ronnie, of course.He pushed himself upright, and put both his irons and the thought of the new Governor firmly from his mind.Dearest mother, John Grey wrote, later that night.I am arrived safely at my new post, and find it comfortable.Colonel Quarry, my predecessorhe is the Duke of Clarences nephew, you recall?made me welcome and acquainted with my charge.I am provided with a most excellent servant, and while I am bound to find many things about Scotland strange at first, I am sure I will find the experience interesting.I was served an object for my supper which the steward told me was called a haggis.Upon inquiry, this proved to be the interior organ of a sheep, filled with a mixture of ground oats and a quantity of unidentifiable cooked flesh.Though I am assured the inhabitants of Scotland esteem this dish a particular delicacy, I sent it to the kitchens and requested a plain boiled saddle of mutton in its place.Having thus made my firsthumble!meal here, and being somewhat fatigued by the long journeyof whose details I shall inform you in a subsequent missiveI believe I shall now retire, leaving further descriptions of my surroundingswith which I am imperfectly acquainted at present, as it is darkfor a future communication.He paused, tapping the quill on the blotter.The point left small dots of ink, and he abstractedly drew lines connecting these, making the outlines of a jagged object.Dared he ask about George?Not a direct inquiry, that wouldnt do, but a reference to the family, asking whether his mother had happened to encounter Lady Everett lately, and might he ask to be remembered to her son?He sighed and drew another point on his object.No.His widowed mother was ignorant of the situation, but Lady Everetts husband moved in military circles.His brothers influence would keep the gossip to a minimum, but Lord Everett might catch a whiff of it, nonetheless, and be quick enough to put two and two together.Let him drop an injudicious word to his wife about George, and the word pass on from Lady Everett to his motherthe Dowager Countess Melton was not a fool.She knew quite well that he was in disgrace; promising young officers in the good graces of their superiors were not sent to the arse end of Scotland to oversee the renovation of small and unimportant prison fortresses.But his brother Harold had told her that the trouble was an unfortunate affair of the heart, implying sufficient indelicacy to stop her questioning him about it.She likely thought he had been caught with his colonels wife, or keeping a whore in his quarters.An unfortunate affair of the heart!He smiled grimly, dipping his pen.Perhaps Hal had a greater sensitivity than hed thought, in so describing it.But then, all his affairs had been unfortunate, since Hectors death at Culloden.With the thought of Culloden, the thought of Fraser came back to him; something he had been avoiding all day.He looked from the blotter to the folder which held the prisoners roll, biting his lip.He was tempted to open it, and look to see the name, but what point was there in that?There might be scores of men in the Highlands named James Fraser, but only one known also as Red Jamie.He felt himself flush as waves of heat rolled over him, but it was not nearness to the fire.In spite of that, he rose and went to the window, drawing in great lungfuls of air as though the cold draft could cleanse him of memory.Pardon, sir, but will ye be wantin your bed warmed now?The Scottish speech behind him startled him, and he whirled round to find the tousled head of the prisoner assigned to tend his quarters poking through the door that led to his private rooms.Oh!Er, yes.Thank youMacDonell?he said doubtfully.MacKay, my lord, the man corrected, without apparent resentment, and the head vanished.Grey sighed.There was nothing that could be done tonight.He came back to the desk and gathered up the folders, to put them away.The jagged object he had drawn on the blotter looked like one of those spiked maces, with which ancient knights had crushed the heads of their foes.He felt as though he had swallowed one, though perhaps this was no more than indigestion occasioned by half cooked mutton.He shook his head, pulled the letter to him and signed it hastily.With all affection, your obt.son, John Wm.Grey.He shook sand over the signature, sealed the missive with his ring and set it aside to be posted in the morning.He rose and stood hesitating, surveying the shadowy reaches of the office.It was a great, cold, barren room, with little in it bar the huge desk and a couple of chairs.He shivered; the sullen glow of the peat bricks on the hearth did little to warm its vast spaces, particularly with the freezing wet air coming in at the window.He glanced once more at the prisoners roll.Then he bent, opened the lower drawer of the desk, and drew out the brown glass bottle.He pinched out the candle, and made his way toward his bed by the dull glow of the hearth.The mingled effects of exhaustion and whisky should have sent him to sleep at once, but sleep kept its distance, hovering over his bed like a bat, but never lighting.Every time he felt himself sinking into dreams, a vision of the wood at Carryarrick came before his eyes, and he found himself lying once more wide awake and sweating, his heart thundering in his ears.He had been sixteen then, excited beyond bearing by his first campaign.He had not got his commission then, but his brother Hal had taken him along with the regiment, so that he might get a taste of soldiering.Camped at night near a dark Scottish wood, on their way to join General Cope at Prestonpans, John had found himself too nervous to sleep.What would the battle be like?Cope was a great general, all Hals friends said so, but the men around the fires told frightful stories of the fierce Highlanders and their bloody broadswords.Would he have the courage to face the dreadful Highland charge?He couldnt bring himself to mention his fears even to Hector.Hector loved him, but Hector was twenty, tall and muscular and fearless, with a lieutenants commission and dashing stories of battles fought in France.He didnt know, even now, whether it had been an urge to emulate Hector, or merely to impress him, that had led him to do it.In either case, when he saw the Highlander in the wood, and recognized him from the broadsheets as the notorious Red Jamie Fraser, he had determined to kill or capture him.The notion of returning to camp for help had occurred to him, but the man was aloneat least John had thought he was aloneand evidently unawares, seated quietly upon a log, eating a bit of bread.And so he had drawn his knife from his belt and crept quietly through the wood toward that shining red head, the haft slippery in his grasp, his mind filled with visions of glory and Hectors praise.Instead, there had been a glancing blow as his knife flashed down, his arm locked tight round the Scots neck to choke him, and then  Lord John Grey flung himself over in his bed, hot with remembrance.They had fallen back, rolling together in the crackling oak leaf dark, grappling for the knife, thrashing and fightingfor his life, he had thought.First the Scot had been under him, then twisting, somehow over.He had touched a great snake once, a python that a friend of his uncles had brought from the Indies, and that was what it had been like, Frasers touch, lithe and smooth and horribly powerful, moving like the muscular coils, never where you expected it to be.He had been flung ignominiously on his face in the leaves, his wrist twisted painfully behind his back.In a frenzy of terror, convinced he was about to be slain, he had wrenched with all his strength at his trapped arm, and the bone had snapped, with a red black burst of pain that rendered him momentarily senseless.He had come to himself moments later, slumped against a tree, facing a circle of ferocious looking Highlanders, all in their plaids.In the midst of them stood Red Jamie Fraserand the woman.Grey clenched his teeth.Curse that woman!If it hadnt been for herwell, God knew what might have happened.What had happened was that she had spoken.She was English, a lady by her speech, and heidiot that he was!had leapt at once to the conclusion that she was a hostage of the vicious Highlanders, no doubt kidnapped for the purpose of ravishment.Everyone said that Highlanders indulged in rapine at every opportunity, and took delight in dishonoring Englishwomen; how should he have known otherwise!And Lord John William Grey, aged sixteen and filled to the brim with regimental notions of gallantry and noble purpose, bruised, shaken, and fighting the pain of his broken arm, had tried to bargain, to save her from her fate.Fraser, tall and mocking, had played him like a salmon, stripping the woman half naked before him to force from him information about the position and strength of his brothers regiment.And then, when he had told all he could, Fraser had laughingly revealed that the woman was his wife.Theyd all laughed; he could hear the ribald Scottish voices now, hilarious in memory.Grey rolled over, shifting his weight irritably on the unaccustomed mattress.And to make it all worse, Fraser had not even had the decency to kill him, but instead had tied him to a tree, where he would be found by his friends in the morning.By which time Frasers men had visited the camp andwith the information he had given them!had immobilized the cannon they were bringing to Cope.Everyone had found out, of course, and while excuses were made because of his age and his noncommissioned status, he had been a pariah and an object of scorn.No one would speak to him, save his brotherand Hector.Loyal Hector.He sighed, rubbing his cheek against the pillow.He could see Hector still, in his minds eye.Dark haired and blue eyed, tender mouthed, always smiling.It had been ten years since Hector had died at Culloden, hacked to pieces by a Highland broadsword, and still John woke in the dawn sometimes, body arched in clutching spasm, feeling Hectors touch.And now this.He had dreaded this posting, being surrounded by Scots, by their grating voices, overwhelmed with the memory of what they had done to Hector.But never, in the most dismal moments of anticipation, had he thought he would ever meet James Fraser again.The peat fire on the hearth died gradually to hot ash, then cold, and the window paled from deep black to the sullen gray of a rainy Scottish dawn.And still John Grey lay sleepless, burning eyes fixed on the smoke blackened beams above him.Grey rose in the morning unrested, but with his mind made up.He was here.Fraser was here.And neither could leave, for the foreseeable future.So.He must see the man now and againhe would be speaking to the assembled prisoners in an hour, and must inspect them regularly thereafterbut he would not see him privately.If he kept the man himself at a distance, perhaps he could also keep at bay the memories he stirred.And the feelings.For while it was the memory of his past rage and humiliation that had kept him awake to begin with, it was the other side of the present situation that had left him still wakeful at dawn.The slowly dawning realization that Fraser was now his prisoner; no longer his tormentor, but a prisoner, like the others, entirely at his mercy.He rang the bell for his servant and padded to the window to see how the weather kept, wincing at the chill of the stone under his bare feet.It was, not surprisingly, raining.In the courtyard below, the prisoners were already being formed up in work crews, wet to the skin.Shivering in his shirt, Grey pulled in his head and shut the window halfway; a nice compromise between death from suffocation and death from the ague.It had been visions of revenge that kept him tossing in his bed as the window lightened and the rain pattered on the sill; thoughts of Fraser confined to a tiny cell of freezing stone, kept naked through the winter nights, fed on slops, stripped and flogged in the courtyard of the prison.All that arrogant power humbled, reduced to groveling misery, dependent solely on his word for a moments relief.Yes, he thought all those things, imagined them in vivid detail, reveled in them.He heard Fraser beg for mercy, imagined himself disdaining, haughty.He thought these things, and the spiked object turned over in his guts, piercing him with self disgust.Whatever he might once have been to Grey, Fraser now was a beaten foe; a prisoner of war, and the charge of the Crown.He was Greys charge, in fact; a responsibility, and his welfare the duty of honor.His servant had brought hot water for shaving.He splashed his cheeks, feeling the warmth soothe him, laying to rest the tormented fancies of the night.That was all they were, he realizedfancies, and the realization brought him a certain relief.He might have met Fraser in battle and taken a real and savage pleasure in killing or maiming him.But the inescapable fact was that so long as Fraser was his prisoner, he could not in honor harm the man.By the time he had shaved and his servant had dressed him, he was recovered enough to find a certain grim humor in the situation.His foolish behavior at Carryarrick had saved Frasers life at Culloden.Now, that debt discharged, and Fraser in his power, Frasers sheer helplessness as a prisoner made him completely safe.For whether foolish or wise, naive or experienced, all the Greys were men of honor.Feeling somewhat better, he met his gaze in the looking glass, set his wig to rights, and went to eat breakfast before giving his first address to the prisoners.Will you have your supper served in the sitting room, sir, or in here?MacKays head, uncombed as ever, poked into the office.Um?Grey murmured, absorbed in the papers spread out on the desk.Oh, he said, looking up.In here, if you please.He waved vaguely at the corner of the huge desk and returned to his work, scarcely looking up when the tray with his food arrived sometime later.Quarry had not been joking about the paperwork.The sheer quantity of food alone required endless orders and requisitionsall orders to be submitted in duplicate to London, if he pleased!let alone the hundreds of other necessities required by the prisoners, the guards, and the men and women from the village who came in by the day to clean the barracks and work in the kitchens.He had done nothing all day but write and sign requisitions.He must find a clerk soon, or die of sheer ennui.Two hundred lb.wheat flowr, he wrote, for prisoners use.Six hogsheads ale, for use of barracks.His normally elegant handwriting had quickly degenerated into a utilitarian scrawl, his stylish signature become a curt J.  Grey.He laid down his pen with a sigh and closed his eyes, massaging the ache between his brows.The sun had not bothered to show its face once since his arrival, and working all day in a smoky room by candlelight left his eyes burning like lumps of coal.His books had arrived the day before, but he had not even unpacked them, too exhausted by nightfall to do more than bathe his aching eyes in cold water and go to sleep.He heard a small, stealthy sound, and sat up abruptly, his eyes popping open.A large brown rat sat on the corner of his desk, a morsel of plum cake held in its front paws.It didnt move, but merely looked at him speculatively, whiskers twitching.Well, God damn my eyes!Grey exclaimed in amazement.Here, you bugger!Thats my supper!The rat nibbled pensively at the plum cake, bright beady eyes fixed on the Major.Get out of it!Enraged, Grey snatched up the nearest object and let fly at the rat.The ink bottle exploded on the stone floor in a spray of black, and the startled rat leapt off the desk and fled precipitously, galloping between the legs of the even more startled MacKay, who appeared at the door to see what the noise was.Has the prison got a cat?Grey demanded, dumping the contents of his supper tray into the waste can by his desk.Aye, sir, theres cats in the storerooms, MacKay offered, crawling backward on hands and knees to wipe up the small black footprints the rat had left in its precipitous flight through the ink puddle.Well, fetch one up here, if you please, MacKay, Grey ordered.At once.He grunted at the memory of that obscenely naked tail draped nonchalantly over his plate.He had encountered rats often enough in the field, of course, but there was something about having his own personal supper molested before his eyes that seemed particularly infuriating.He strode to the window and stood there, trying to clear his head with fresh air, as MacKay finished his mopping up.Dusk was drawing down, filling the courtyard with purple shadows.The stones of the cell wing opposite looked even colder and more dreary than usual.The turnkeys were coming through the rain from the kitchen wing; a procession of small carts laden with the prisoners food; huge pots of steaming oatmeal and baskets of bread, covered with cloths against the rain.At least the poor devils had hot food after their wet days work in the stone quarry.A thought struck him as he turned from the window.Are there many rats in the cells?he asked MacKay.Aye, sir, a great many, the prisoner replied, with a final swipe to the threshold.Ill tell the cook to make ye up a fresh tray, shall I, sir?If you please, Grey said.And then if you will, Mr.MacKay, please see that each cell is provided with its own cat.MacKay looked slightly dubious at this.Grey paused in the act of retrieving his scattered papers.Is there something wrong, MacKay?No, sir, MacKay replied slowly.Only the wee brown beasties do keep down the cockchafers.And with respect, sir, I dinna think the men would care to have a cat takin all their rats.Grey stared at the man, feeling mildly queasy.The prisoners eat the rats?he asked, with a vivid memory of sharp yellow teeth nibbling at his plum cake.Only when theyre lucky enough to catch one, sir, MacKay said.Perhaps the cats would be a help wi that, after all.Will that be all for tonight, sir?9  THE WANDERER  Greys resolve concerning James Fraser lasted for two weeks.Then the messenger arrived from the village of Ardsmuir, with news that changed everything.Does he still live?he asked the man sharply.The messenger, one of the inhabitants of Ardsmuir village who worked for the prison, nodded.I saw him mysel, sir, when they brought him in.Hes at the Lime Tree now, being cared forbut I didna think he looked as though care would be enough, sir, if ye take my meaning.He raised one brow significantly.I take it, Grey answered shortly.Thank you, Mr.Allison, sir, Rufus Allison.Your servant, sir.The man accepted the shilling offered him, bowed with his hat under his arm, and took his leave.Grey sat at his desk, staring out at the leaden sky.The sun had scarcely shone for a day since his arrival.He tapped the end of the quill with which he had been writing on the desk, oblivious to the damage he was inflicting on the sharpened tip.The mention of gold was enough to prick up any mans ears, but especially his.A man had been found this morning, wandering in the mist on the moor near the village.His clothes were soaked not only with the damp, but with seawater, and he was out of his mind with fever.He had talked unceasingly since he was found, babbling for the most part, but his rescuers were unable to make much sense of his ravings.The man appeared to be Scottish, and yet he spoke in an incoherent mixture of French and Gaelic, with here and there the odd word of English thrown in.And one of those words had been gold.The combination of Scots, gold, and the French tongue, mentioned in this area of the country, could bring only one thought to the mind of anyone who had fought through the last days of the Jacobite rising.The Frenchmans Gold.The fortune in gold bullion that Louis of France hadaccording to rumorsent secretly to the aid of his cousin, Charles Stuart.But sent far too late.Some stories said that the French gold had been hidden by the Highland army during the last headlong retreat to the North, before the final disaster at Culloden.Others held that the gold had never reached Charles Stuart, but had been left for safekeeping in a cave near the place where it had come ashore on the northwestern coast.Some said that the secret of the hiding place had been lost, its guardian killed at Culloden.Others said that the hiding place was still known, but a close kept secret, held among the members of a single Highland family.Whatever the truth, the gold had never been found.Not yet.French and Gaelic.Grey spoke passable French, the result of several years fighting abroad, but neither he nor any of his officers spoke the barbarous Gaelic, save a few words Sergeant Grissom had learned as a child from a Scottish nursemaid.He could not trust a man from the village; not if there was anything to this tale.The Frenchmans Gold!Beyond its value as treasurewhich would belong to the Crown in any casethe gold had a considerable and personal value to John William Grey.The finding of that half mythical hoard would be his passport out of Ardsmuirback to London and civilization.The blackest disgrace would be instantly obscured by the dazzle of gold.He bit the end of the blunted quill, feeling the cylinder crack between his teeth.Damn.No, it couldnt be a villager, nor one of his officers.A prisoner, then.Yes, he could use a prisoner without risk, for a prisoner would be unable to make use of the information for his own ends.Damn again.All of the prisoners spoke Gaelic, many had some English as wellbut only one spoke French besides.He is an educated man, Quarrys voice echoed in his memory.Damn, damn, damn!Grey muttered.It couldnt be helped.Allison had said the wanderer was very ill; there was no time to look for alternatives.He spat out a shred of quill.Brame!he shouted.The startled corporal poked his head in.Yes, sir?Bring me a prisoner named James Fraser.At once.The Governor stood behind his desk, leaning on it as though the huge slab of oak were in fact the bulwark it looked.His hands were damp on the smooth wood, and the white stock of his uniform felt tight around his neck.His heart leapt violently as the door opened.The Scot came in, his irons chinking slightly, and stood before the desk.The candles were all lit, and the office nearly as bright as day, though it was nearly full dark outside.He had seen Fraser several times, of course, standing in the courtyard with the other prisoners, red head and shoulders above most of the other men, but never close enough to see his face clearly.He looked different.That was both shock and relief; for so long, he had seen a clean shaven face in memory, dark with threat or alight with mocking laughter.This man was short bearded, his face calm and wary, and while the deep blue eyes were the same, they gave no sign of recognition.The man stood quietly before the desk, waiting.Grey cleared his throat.His heart was still beating too fast, but at least he could speak calmly.Mr.Fraser, he said.I thank you for coming.The Scot bent his head courteously, but did not answer that he had had no choice in the matter; his eyes said that.Doubtless you wonder why I have sent for you, Grey said.He sounded insufferably pompous to his own ears, but was unable to remedy it.I find that a situation has arisen in which I require your assistance.What is that, Major?The voice was the samedeep and precise, marked with a soft Highland burr.He took a deep breath, bracing himself on the desk.He would rather have done anything but ask help of this particular man, but there was no bloody choice.Fraser was the only possibility.A man has been found wandering the moor near the coast, he said carefully.He appears to be seriously ill, and his speech is deranged.However, certainmatters to which he refers appear to be ofsubstantial interest to the Crown.I require to talk with him, and discover as much as I can of his identity, and the matters of which he speaks.He paused, but Fraser merely stood there, waiting.Unfortunately, Grey said, taking another breath, the man in question has been heard to speak in a mixture of Gaelic and French, with no more than a word or two of English.One of the Scots ruddy eyebrows stirred.His face didnt change in any appreciable way, but it was evident that he had grasped the implications of the situation.I see, Major.The Scots soft voice was full of irony.And you would like my assistance to interpret for ye what this man might have to say.Grey couldnt trust himself to speak, but merely jerked his head in a short nod.I fear I must decline, Major.Fraser spoke respectfully, but with a glint in his eye that was anything but respectful.Greys hand curled tight around the brass letter opener on his blotter.You decline?he said.He tightened his grasp on the letter opener in order to keep his voice steady.Might I inquire why, Mr.Fraser?I am a prisoner, Major, the Scot said politely.Not an interpreter.Your assistance would beappreciated, Grey said, trying to infuse the word with significance without offering outright bribery.Conversely, his tone hardened, a failure to render legitimate assistance  It is not legitimate for ye either to extort my services or to threaten me, Major.Frasers voice was a good deal harder than Greys.I did not threaten you!The edge of the letter opener was cutting into his hand; he was forced to loosen his grip.Did ye no?Well, and Im pleased to hear it.Fraser turned toward the door.In that case, Major, I shall bid ye good night.Grey would have given a great deal simply to have let him go.Unfortunately, duty called.Mr.Fraser!The Scot stopped, a few feet from the door, but didnt turn.Grey took a deep breath, steeling himself to it.If you do what I ask, I will have your irons struck off, he said.Fraser stood quite still.Young and inexperienced Grey might be, but he was not unobservant.Neither was he a poor judge of men.Grey watched the rise of his prisoners head, the increased tension of his shoulders, and felt a small relaxation of the anxiety that had gripped him since the news of the wanderer had come.Mr.Fraser?he said.Very slowly, the Scot turned around.His face was quite expressionless.You have a bargain, Major, he said softly.It was well past midnight when they arrived in the village of Ardsmuir.No lights showed in the cottages they passed, and Grey found himself wondering what the inhabitants thought, as the sound of hooves and the jingle of arms passed by their windows late at night, a faint echo of the English troops who had swept through the Highlands ten years before.The wanderer had been taken to the Lime Tree, an inn so called because for many years, it had boasted a huge lime tree in the yard; the only tree of any size for thirty miles.There was nothing left now but a broad stumpthe tree, like so many other things, had perished in the aftermath of Culloden, burned for firewood by Cumberlands troopsbut the name remained.At the door, Grey paused and turned to Fraser.You will recall the terms of our agreement?I will, Fraser answered shortly, and brushed past him.In return for having the irons removed, Grey had required three things: firstly, that Fraser would not attempt to escape during the journey to or from the village.Secondly, Fraser would undertake to give a full and true account of all that the vagrant should say.And thirdly, Fraser would give his word as a gentleman to speak to no one but Grey of what he learned.There was a murmur of Gaelic voices inside; a sound of surprise as the innkeeper saw Fraser, and deference at the sight of the red coat behind him.The goodwife stood on the stair, an oil dip in her hand making the shadows dance around her.Grey laid a hand on the innkeepers arm, startled.Who is that?There was another figure on the stairs, an apparition, clothed all in black.That is the priest, Fraser said quietly, beside him.The man will be dying, then.Grey took a deep breath, trying to steady himself for what might come.Then there is little time to waste, he said firmly, setting a booted foot on the stair.Let us proceed.The man died just before dawn, Fraser holding one of his hands, the priest the other.As the priest leaned over the bed, mumbling in Gaelic and Latin, making Popish signs over the body, Fraser sat back on his stool, eyes closed, still holding the small, frail hand in his own.The big Scot had sat by the mans side all night, listening, encouraging, comforting.Grey had stood by the door, not wishing to frighten the man by the sight of his uniform, both surprised and oddly touched at Frasers gentleness.Now Fraser laid the thin weathered hand gently across the still chest, and made the same sign as the priest had, touching forehead, heart, and both shoulders in turn, in the sign of a cross.He opened his eyes, and rose to his feet, his head nearly brushing the low rafters.He nodded briefly to Grey, and preceded him down the narrow stair.In here.Grey motioned to the door of the taproom, empty at this hour.A sleepy eyed barmaid laid the fire for them and brought bread and ale, then went out, leaving them alone.He waited for Fraser to refresh himself before asking.Well, Mr.Fraser?The Scot set down his pewter mug and wiped a hand across his mouth.Already bearded, with his long hair neatly plaited, he didnt look disheveled by the long night watch, but there were dark smudges of tiredness under his eyes.All right, he said.It doesna make a great deal of sense, Major, he added warningly, but this is all he said.And he spoke carefully, pausing now and then to recall a word, stopping again to explain some Gaelic reference.Grey sat listening in deepening disappointment; Fraser had been correctit didnt make much sense.The white witch?Grey interrupted.He spoke of a white witch?And seals?It scarcely seemed more farfetched than the rest of it, but still he spoke disbelievingly.Aye, he did.Say it to me again, Grey commanded.As best you remember.If you please, he added.He felt oddly comfortable with the man, he realized, with a feeling of surprise.Part of it was sheer fatigue, of course; all his usual reactions and feelings were numbed by the long night and the strain of watching a man die by inches.The entire night had seemed unreal to Grey; not least was this odd conclusion, wherein he found himself sitting in the dim dawn light of a country tavern, sharing a pitcher of ale with Red Jamie Fraser.Fraser obeyed, speaking slowly, stopping now and then to recall.With the difference of a word here or there, it was identical to the first accountand those parts of it that Grey himself had been able to understand were faithfully translated.He shook his head, discouraged.Gibberish.The mans ravings had been precisely thatravings.If the man had ever seen any goldand it did sound as though he had, at one timethere was no telling where or when from this hodgepodge of delusion and feverish delirium.You are quite positive that is all he said?Grey grasped at the slim hope that Fraser might have omitted some small phrase, some statement that would yield a clue to the lost gold.Frasers sleeve fell back as he lifted his cup; Grey could see the deep band of raw flesh about his wrist, dark in the gray early light of the taproom.Fraser saw him looking at it, and set down the cup, the frail illusion of companionship shattered.I keep my bargains, Major, Fraser said, with cold formality.He rose to his feet.Shall we be going back now?They rode in silence for some time.Fraser was lost in his own thoughts, Grey sunk in fatigue and disappointment.They stopped at a small spring to refresh themselves, just as the sun topped the small hills to the north.Grey drank cold water, then splashed it on his face, feeling the shock of it revive him momentarily.He had been awake for more than twenty four hours, and was feeling slow and stupid.Fraser had been awake for the same twenty four hours, but gave no apparent sign of being troubled by the fact.He was crawling busily around the spring on his hands and knees, evidently plucking some sort of weed from the water.What are you doing, Mr.Fraser?Grey asked, in some bewilderment.Fraser looked up, mildly surprised, but not embarrassed in the slightest.I am picking watercress, Major.I see that, Grey said testily.What for?To eat, Major, Fraser replied evenly.He took the stained cloth bag from his belt and dropped the dripping green mass into it.Indeed?Are you not fed sufficiently?Grey asked blankly.I have never heard of people eating watercress.Its green, Major.In his fatigued state, the Major had suspicions that he was being practiced upon.What in damnation other color ought a weed to be?he demanded.Frasers mouth twitched slightly, and he seemed to be debating something with himself.At last he shrugged slightly, wiping his wet hands on the sides of his breeks.I only meant, Major, that eating green plants will stop ye getting scurvy and loose teeth.My men eat such greens as I take them, and cress is better tasting than most things I can pick on the moor.Grey felt his brows shoot up.Green plants stop scurvy?he blurted.Wherever did you get that notion?From my wife!Fraser snapped.He turned away abruptly, and stood, tying the neck of his sack with hard, quick movements.Grey could not prevent himself asking.Your wife, sirwhere is she?The answer was a sudden blaze of dark blue that seared him to the backbone, so shocking was its intensity.Perhaps you are too young to know the power of hate and despair.Quarrys voice spoke in Greys memory.He was not; he recognized them at once in the depths of Frasers eyes.Only for a moment, though; then the mans normal veil of cool politeness was back in place.My wife is gone, Fraser said, and turned away again, so abruptly that the movement verged on rudeness.Grey felt himself shaken by an unexpected feeling.In part it was relief.The woman who had been both cause of and party to his humiliation was dead.In part, it was regret.Neither of them spoke again on the journey back to Ardsmuir.Three days later, Jamie Fraser escaped.It had never been a difficult matter for prisoners to escape from Ardsmuir; no one ever did, simply because there was no place for a man to go.Three miles from the prison, the coast of Scotland dropped into the ocean in a spill of crumbled granite.On the other three sides, nothing but empty moorland stretched for miles.Once, a man might take to the heather, depending on clan and kinsmen for support and protection.But the clans were crushed, the kin dead, the Scottish prisoners removed far away from their own clan lands.Starving on the bleak moor was little improvement on a prison cell.Escape was not worth itto anyone but Jamie Fraser, who evidently had a reason.The dragoons horses kept to the road; while the surrounding moor looked smooth as a velvet counterpane, the purpling heather was a thin layer, deceptively spread over a foot or more of wet, spongy peat moss.Even the red deer didnt walk at random in that boggy massGrey could see four of the animals now, stick figures a mile away, the line of their track through the heather seeming no wider than a thread.Fraser, of course, was not mounted.That meant that the escaped prisoner might be anywhere on the moor, free to follow the red deers paths.It was John Greys duty to pursue his prisoner and attempt his recapture.It was something more than duty that had made him strip the garrison for his search party, and urge them on with only the briefest of stops for rest and food.Duty, yes, and an urgent desire to find the French gold and win approval from his mastersand reprieve from this desolate Scottish exile.But there was anger, too, and an odd sense of personal betrayal.Grey wasnt sure whether he was more angry at Fraser for breaking his word, or at himself, for having been fool enough to believe that a Highlandergentleman or notheld a sense of honor equal to his own.But angry he was, and determined to search every deer path on this moor if necessary, in order to lay James Fraser by the heels.They reached the coast the next night, well after dark, after a laborious day of combing the moor.The fog had thinned away over the rocks, swept out by the offshore wind, and the sea spread out before them, cradled by cliffs and strewn with tiny barren islets.John Grey stood beside his horse on the clifftops, looking down at the wild black sea.It was a clear night on the coast, thank God, and the moon was at the half; its gleam painted the spray wet rocks, making them stand out hard and shining as silver ingots against black velvet shadows.It was the most desolate place he had ever seen, though it had a sort of terrible beauty about it that made the blood run cold in his veins.There was no sign of James Fraser.No sign of life at all.One of the men with him gave a sudden exclamation of surprise, and drew his pistol.There!he said.On the rocks!Hold your fire, fool, said another of the soldiers, grabbing his companions arm.He made no effort to disguise his contempt.Have you neer seen seals?Ahno, said the first man, rather sheepishly.He lowered his pistol, staring out at the small dark forms on the rocks below.Grey had never seen seals, either, and he watched them with fascination.They looked like black slugs from this distance, the moonlight gleaming wetly on their coats as they raised restless heads, seeming to roll and weave unsteadily as they made their awkward way on land.His mother had had a cloak made of sealskin, when he was a boy.He had been allowed to touch it once, marveling at the feel of it, dark and warm as a moonless summer night.Amazing that such thick, soft fur came from these slick, wet creatures.The Scots call them silkies, said the soldier who had recognized them.He nodded at the seals with the proprietary air of special knowledge.Silkies?Greys attention was caught; he stared at the man with interest.What else do you know about them, Sykes?The soldier shrugged, enjoying his momentary importance.Not a great deal, sir.The folk hereabout have stories about them, though; they say sometimes one of them will come ashore and leave off its skin, and inside is a beautiful woman.If a man should find the skin, and hide it, so she cant go back, why thenshell be forced to stay and be his wife.They make good wives, sir, or so Im told.At least theyd always be wet, murmured the first soldier, and the men erupted in guffaws that echoed among the cliffs, raucous as seabirds.Thats enough!Grey had to raise his voice, to be heard above the rash of laughter and crude suggestions.Spread out!Grey ordered.I want the cliffs searched in both directionsand keep an eye out for boats below; God knows theres room enough to hide a sloop behind some of those islands.Abashed, the men went without comment.They returned an hour later, wet from spray and disheveled with climbing, but with no sign of Jamie Fraseror the Frenchmans Gold.At dawn, as the light stained the slippery rocks red and gold, small parties of dragoons were sent off to search the cliffs in both directions, making their way carefully down the rocky clefts and tumbled piles of stone.Nothing was found.Grey stood by a fire on the clifftop, keeping an eye on the search.He was swathed in his greatcoat against the biting wind, and fortified periodically by hot coffee, supplied by his servant.The man at the Lime Tree had come from the sea, his clothes soaked in saltwater.Whether Fraser had learned something from the mans words that he had not told, or had decided only to take the chance of looking for himself, surely he also would have gone to the sea.And yet there was no sign of James Fraser, anywhere along this stretch of coast.Worse yet, there was no sign of the gold.If he went in anywhere along this stretch, Major, youll have seen the last of him, Im thinking.It was Sergeant Grissom, standing beside him, gazing down at the crash and whirl of water through the jagged rocks below.He nodded at the furious water.They call this spot the Devils Cauldron, because of the way it boils all the time.Fishermen drowned off this coast are seldom found; there are wicked currents to blame for it, of course, but folk say the Devil seizes them and pulls them below.Do they?Grey said bleakly.He stared down into the smash and spume forty feet below.I wouldnt doubt it, Sergeant.He turned back toward the campfire.Give orders to search until nightfall, Sergeant.If nothing is found, well start back in the morning.Grey lifted his gaze from his horses neck, squinting through the dim early light.His eyes felt swollen from peat smoke and lack of sleep, and his bones ached from several nights spent lying on damp ground.The ride back to Ardsmuir would take no more than a day.The thought of a soft bed and a hot supper was delightfulbut then he would have to write the official dispatch to London, confessing Frasers escapethe reason for itand his own shameful failure to recapture the man.The feeling of bleakness at this prospect was reinforced by a deep griping in the majors lower abdomen.He raised a hand, signaling a halt, and slid wearily to the ground.Wait here, he said to his men.There was a small hillock a few hundred feet away; it would afford him sufficient privacy for the relief he sorely needed; his bowels, unaccustomed to Scottish parritch and oatcake, had rebelled altogether at the exigencies of a field diet.The birds were singing in the heather.Away from the noise of hooves and harness, he could hear all the tiny sounds of the waking moor.The wind had changed with the dawn, and the scent of the sea came inland now, whispering through the grass.Some small animal made a rustling noise on the other side of a gorse bush.It was all very peaceful.Straightening up from what too late struck him as a most undignified posture, Grey raised his head and looked straight into the face of James Fraser.He was no more than six feet away.He stood still as one of the red deer, the moor wind brushing over him, with the rising sun tangled in his hair.They stood frozen, staring at each other.The smell of the sea came faintly on the wind.There was no sound but the sea wind and the singing of meadowlarks for a moment.Then Grey drew himself up, swallowing to bring his heart down from his throat.I fear you take me at a disadvantage, Mr.Fraser, he said coolly, fastening his breeches with as much self possession as he could muster.The Scots eyes were the only part of him to move, down over Grey and slowly back up.Looked over his shoulder, to where six armed soldiers stood, pointing their muskets.Dark blue eyes met his, straight on.At last, the edge of Frasers mouth twitched, and he said, I think ye take me at the same, Major.10  WHITE WITCHS CURSE  Jamie Fraser sat shivering on the stone floor of the empty storeroom, clutching his knees and trying to get warm.He thought he likely would never be warm again.The chill of the sea had seeped into his bones, and he could still feel the churn of the crashing breakers, deep in his belly.He wished for the presence of the other prisonersMorrison, Hayes, Sinclair, Sutherland.Not only for company, but for the heat of their bodies.On bitter nights, the men would huddle close together for warmth, breathing each others stale breath, tolerating the bump and knock of close quarters for the sake of warmth.He was alone, though.Likely they would not return him to the large cell with the other men until after they had done whatever they meant to do to him as punishment for escaping.He leaned back against the wall with a sigh, morbidly aware of the bones of his spine pressing against the stone, and the fragility of the flesh covering them.He was very much afraid of being flogged, and yet he hoped that would be his punishment.It would be horrible, but it would be soon overand infinitely more bearable than being put back in irons.He could feel in his flesh the crash of the smiths hammer, echoing through the bones of his arm as the smith pounded the fetters firmly into place, holding his wrist steady on the anvil.His fingers sought the rosary around his neck.His sister had given it to him when he left Lallybroch; the English had let him keep it, as the string of beechwood beads had no value.Hail Mary, full of grace, he muttered, blessed art thou amongst women.He hadnt much hope.That wee yellow haired fiend of a major had seen, damn his soulhe knew just how terrible the fetters had been.Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners  The wee Major had made him a bargain, and he had kept it.The major would not be thinking so, though.He had kept his oath, had done as he promised.Had relayed the words spoken to him, one by one, just as he had heard them from the wandering man.It was no part of his bargain to tell the Englishman that he knew the manor what conclusions he had drawn from the muttered words.He had recognized Duncan Kerr at once, changed though he was by time and mortal illness.Before Culloden, he had been a tacksman of Colum MacKenzie, Jamies uncle.After, he had escaped to France, to eke out what living might be made there.Be still, a charaid; bi smhach, he had said softly in Gaelic, dropping to his knees by the bed where the sick man lay.Duncan was an elderly man, his worn face wasted by illness and fatigue, and his eyes were bright with fever.At first he had thought Duncan too far gone to know him, but the wasted hand had gripped his with surprising strength, and the man had repeated through his rasping breath, mo charaid.My kinsman.The innkeeper was watching, from his place near the door, peering over Major Greys shoulder.Jamie had bent his head and whispered in Duncans ear, All you say will be told to the English.Speak wary.The landlords eyes narrowed, but the distance between them was too far; Jamie was sure he hadnt heard.Then the Major had turned and ordered the innkeeper out, and he was safe.He couldnt tell whether it was the effect of his warning, or only the derangement of fever, but Duncans speech wandered with his mind, often incoherent, images of the past overlapping with those of the present.Sometimes he had called Jamie Dougal, the name of Colums brother, Jamies other uncle.Sometimes he dropped into poetry, sometimes he simply raved.And within the ravings and the scattered words, sometimes there was a grain of senseor more than sense.It is cursed, Duncan whispered.The gold is cursed.Do ye be warned, lad.It was given by the white witch, given for the Kings son.But the Cause is lost, and the Kings son fled, and she will not let the gold be given to a coward.Who is she?Jamie asked.His heart had sprung up and choked him at Duncans words, and it beat madly as he asked.The white witchwho is she?She seeks a brave man.A MacKenzie, it is for Himself.MacKenzie.It is theirs, she says it, for the sake of him who is dead.Who is the witch?Jamie asked again.The word Duncan used was ban druidha witch, a wisewoman, a white lady.They had called his wife that, once.Clairehis own white lady.He squeezed Duncans hand tight in his own, willing him to keep his senses.Who?he said again.Who is the witch?The witch, Duncan muttered, his eyes closing.The witch.She is a soul eater.She is death.He is dead, the MacKenzie, he is dead.Who is dead?Colum MacKenzie?All of them, all of them.All dead.All dead!cried the sick man, clutching tight to his hand.Colum, and Dougal, and Ellen, too.Suddenly his eyes opened, and fixed on Jamies.The fever had dilated his pupils, so his gaze seemed a pool of drowning black.Folk do say, he said, with surprising clarity, as how Ellen MacKenzie did leave her brothers and her home, and go to wed with a silkie from the sea.She heard them, aye?Duncan smiled dreamily, the black stare swimming with distant vision.She heard the silkies singing, there upon the rocks, one, and two, and three of them, and she saw from her tower, one and two, and three of them, and so she came down, and went to the sea, and so under it, to live wi the silkies.Aye?Did she no?So folk say, Jamie had answered, mouth gone dry.Ellen had been his mothers name.And that was what folk had said, when she had left her home, to elope with Brian Dubh Fraser, a man with the shining black hair of a silkie.The man for whose sake he was himself now called Mac DubhBlack Brians son.Major Grey stood close, on the other side of the bed, brow furrowed as he watched Duncans face.The Englishman had no Gaelic, but Jamie would have been willing to wager that he knew the word for gold.He caught the Majors eye, and nodded, bending again to speak to the sick man.The gold, man, he said, in French, loud enough for Grey to hear.Where is the gold?He squeezed Duncans hand as hard as he could, hoping to convey some warning.Duncans eyes closed, and he rolled his head restlessly, to and fro upon the pillow.He muttered something, but the words were too faint to catch.What did he say?the Major demanded sharply.What?I dont know.Jamie patted Duncans hand to rouse him.Speak to me, man, tell me again.There was no response save more muttering.Duncans eyes had rolled back in his head, so that only a thin line of gleaming white showed beneath the wrinkled lids.Impatient, the Major leaned forward and shook him by one shoulder.Wake up!he said.Speak to us!At once Duncan Kerrs eyes flew open.He stared up, up, past the two faces bending over him, seeing something far beyond them.She will tell you, he said, in Gaelic.She will come for you.For a split second, his attention seemed to return to the inn room where he lay, and his eyes focused on the men with him.For both of you, he said distinctly.Then he closed his eyes, and spoke no more, but clung ever tighter to Jamies hand.Then after a time, his grip relaxed, his hand slid free, and it was over.The guardianship of the gold had passed.And so, Jamie Fraser had kept his word to the Englishmanand his obligation to his countrymen.He had told the Major all that Duncan had said, and the devil of a help to him that had been!And when the opportunity of escape offered, he had taken itgone to the heather and sought the sea, and done what he could with Duncan Kerrs legacy.And now he must pay the price of his actions, whatever that turned out to be.There were footsteps coming down the corridor outside.He clutched his knees harder, trying to quell the shivering.At least it would be decided now, either way.pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death, amen.The door swung open, letting in a shaft of light that made him blink.It was dark in the corridor, but the guard standing over him held a torch.On your feet.The man reached down and pulled him up against the stiffness of his joints.He was pushed toward the door, stumbling.Youre wanted upstairs.Upstairs?Where?He was startled at thatthe smiths forge was downstairs from where he was, off the courtyard.And they wouldnt flog him so late in the evening.The mans face twisted, fierce and ruddy in the torchlight.To the Majors quarters, the guard said, grinning.And may God have mercy on your soul, Mac Dubh.No, sir, I will not say where I have been.He repeated it firmly, trying not to let his teeth chatter.He had been brought not to the office, but to Greys private sitting room.There was a fire on the hearth, but Grey was standing in front of it, blocking most of the warmth.Nor why you chose to escape?Greys voice was cool and formal.Jamies face tightened.He had been placed near the bookshelf, where the light of a triple branched candlestick fell on his face; Grey himself was no more than a silhouette, black against the fires glow.That is my private affair, he said.Private affair?Grey echoed incredulously.Did you say your private affair?I did.The Governor inhaled strongly through his nose.That is possibly the most outrageous thing I have heard in my life!Your life has been rather brief, then, Major, Fraser said.If you will pardon my saying so.There was no point in dragging it out or trying to placate the man.Better to provoke a decision at once and get it over with.He had certainly provoked something; Greys fists clenched tight at his sides, and he took a step toward him, away from the fire.Have you any notion what I could do to you for this?Grey inquired, his voice low and very much controlled.Aye, I have.Major.More than a notion.He knew from experience what they might do to him, and he wasnt looking forward to it.It wasnt as though hed a choice about it, though.Grey breathed heavily for a moment, then jerked his head.Come here, Mr.Fraser, he ordered.Jamie stared at him, puzzled.Here!he said peremptorily, pointing to a spot directly before him on the hearthrug.Stand here, sir!I am not a dog, Major!Jamie snapped.Yell do as ye like wi me, but Ill no come when ye call me to heel!Taken by surprise, Grey uttered a short, involuntary laugh.My apologies, Mr.Fraser, he said dryly.I meant no offense by the address.I merely wish you to approach nearer.If you will?He stepped aside and bowed elaborately, gesturing to the hearth.Jamie hesitated, but then stepped warily onto the patterned rug.Grey stepped close to him, nostrils flared.So close, the fine bones and fair skin of his face made him look almost girlish.The Major put a hand on his sleeve, and the long lashed eyes sprang wide in shock.Youre wet!Yes, I am wet, Jamie said, with elaborate patience.He was also freezing.A fine, continuous shiver ran through him, even this close to the fire.Why?Why?Jamie echoed, astonished.Did you not order the guards to douse me wi water before leaving me in a freezing cell?I did not, no.It was clear enough that the Major was telling the truth; his face was pale under the ruddy flush of the firelight, and he looked angry.His lips thinned to a fine line.I apologize for this, Mr.Fraser.Accepted, Major.Small wisps of steam were beginning to rise from his clothes, but the warmth was seeping through the damp cloth.His muscles ached from the shivering, and he wished he could lie down on the hearthrug, dog or not.Did your escape have anything to do with the matter of which you learned at the Lime Tree Inn?Jamie stood silent.The ends of his hair were drying, and small wisps floated across his face.Will you swear to me that your escape had nothing to do with that matter?Jamie stood silent.There seemed no point in saying anything, now.The little Major was pacing up and down the hearth before him, hands locked behind his back.Now and then, the Major glanced up at him, and then resumed his pacing.Finally he stopped in front of Jamie.Mr.Fraser, he said formally.I will ask you once morewhy did you escape from the prison?Jamie sighed.He wouldnt get to stand by the fire much longer.I cannot tell you, Major.Cannot or will not?Grey asked sharply.It doesna seem a useful distinction, Major, as ye willna hear anything, either way.He closed his eyes and waited, trying to soak up as much heat as possible before they took him away.Grey found himself at a loss, both for words and action.Stubborn does not begin to describe it, Quarry had said.It didnt.He took a deep breath, wondering what to do.He found himself embarrassed by the petty cruelty of the guards revenge; the more so because it was just such an action he had first contemplated upon hearing that Fraser was his prisoner.He would be perfectly within his rights now to order the man flogged, or put back in irons.Condemned to solitary confinement, put on short rationshe could in justice inflict any of a dozen different punishments.And if he did, the odds of his ever finding the Frenchmans Gold became vanishingly small.The gold did exist.Or at least there was a good probability that it did.Only a belief in that gold would have stirred Fraser to act as he had.He eyed the man.Frasers eyes were closed, his lips set firmly.He had a wide, strong mouth, whose grim expression was somewhat belied by the sensitive lips, set soft and exposed in their curly nest of red beard.Grey paused, trying to think of some way to break past the mans wall of bland defiance.To use force would be worse than uselessand after the guards actions, he would be ashamed to order it, even had he the stomach for brutality.The clock on the mantelpiece struck ten.It was late; there was no sound in the fortress, save the occasional footsteps of the soldier on sentry in the courtyard outside the window.Clearly neither force nor threat would work in gaining the truth.Reluctantly, he realized that there was only one course open to him, if he still wished to pursue the gold.He must put aside his feelings about the man and take Quarrys suggestion.He must pursue an acquaintance, in the course of which he might worm out of the man some clue that would lead him to the hidden treasure.If it existed, he reminded himself, turning to his prisoner.He took a deep breath.Mr.Fraser, he said formally, will you do me the honor to take supper tomorrow in my quarters?He had the momentary satisfaction of having startled the Scottish bastard, at least.The blue eyes opened wide, and then Fraser regained the mastery of his face.He paused for a moment, and then bowed with a flourish, as though he wore a kilt and swinging plaid, and not damp prison rags.It will be my pleasure to attend ye, Major, he said.March 7, 1755  Fraser was delivered by the guard and left to wait in the sitting room, where a table was laid.When Grey came through the door from his bedroom a few moments later, he found his guest standing by the bookshelf, apparently absorbed in a copy of Nouvelle Hlose.You are interested in French novels?he blurted, not realizing until too late how incredulous the question sounded.Fraser glanced up, startled, and snapped the book shut.Very deliberately, he returned it to its shelf.I can read, Major, he said.He had shaved; a slight flush burned high on his cheekbones.Iyes, of course I did not meanI merely Greys own cheeks were more flushed than Frasers.The fact was that he had subconsciously assumed that the other did not read, his evident education notwithstanding, merely because of his Highland accent and shabby dress.While his coat might be shabby, Frasers manners were not.He ignored Greys flustered apology, and turned to the bookshelf.I have been telling the men the story, but it has been some time since I read it; I thought I would refresh my memory as to the sequence of the ending.I see.Just in time, Grey stopped himself from saying They understand it?Fraser evidently read the unspoken question in his face, for he said dryly, All Scottish children are taught their letters, Major.Still, we have a great tradition of storytelling in the Highlands.Ah.Yes.I see.The entry of his servant with dinner saved him from further awkwardness, and the supper passed uneventfully, though there was little conversation, and that little, limited to the affairs of the prison.The next time, he had had the chess table set up before the fire, and invited Fraser to join him in a game before the supper was served.There had been a brief flash of surprise from the slanted blue eyes, and then a nod of acquiescence.That had been a small stroke of genius, Grey thought in retrospect.Relieved of the need for conversation or social courtesies, they had slowly become accustomed to each other as they sat over the inlaid board of ivory and ebony wood, gauging each other silently by the movements of the chessmen.When they had at length sat down to dine, they were no longer quite strangers, and the conversation, while still wary and formal, was at least true conversation, and not the awkward affair of starts and stops it had been before.They discussed matters of the prison, had a little conversation of books, and parted formally, but on good terms.Grey did not mention gold.And so the weekly custom was established.Grey sought to put his guest at ease, in the hopes that Fraser might let drop some clue to the fate of the Frenchmans Gold.It had not come so far, despite careful probing.Any hint of inquiry as to what had transpired during the three days of Frasers absence from Ardsmuir met with silence.Over the mutton and boiled potatoes, he did his best to draw his odd guest into a discussion of France and its politics, by way of discovering whether there might exist any links between Fraser and a possible source of gold from the French Court.Much to his surprise, he was informed that Fraser had in fact spent two years living in France, employed in the wine business, prior to the Stuart rebellion.A certain cool humor in Frasers eyes indicated that the man was well aware of the motives behind this questioning.At the same time, he acquiesced gracefully enough in the conversation, though taking some care always to lead questions away from his personal life, and instead toward more general matters of art and society.Grey had spent some time in Paris, and despite his attempts at probing Frasers French connections, found himself becoming interested in the conversation for its own sake.Tell me, Mr.Fraser, during your time in Paris, did you chance to encounter the dramatic works of Monsieur Voltaire?Fraser smiled.Oh, aye, Major.In fact, I was privileged to entertain Monsieur ArouetVoltaire being his nom de plume, aye?at my table, on more than one occasion.Really?Grey cocked a brow in interest.And is he as great a wit in person as with the pen?I couldna really say, Fraser replied, tidily forking up a slice of mutton.He seldom said anything at all, let alone much sparkling with wit.He only sat hunched over in his chair, watching everyone, wi his eyes rolling about from one to another.I shouldna be at all surprised to hear that things said at my dinner table later appeared on the stage, though fortunately I never encountered a parody of myself in his work.He closed his eyes in momentary concentration, chewing his mutton.Is the meat to your taste, Mr.Fraser?Grey inquired politely.It was gristled, tough, and seemed barely edible to him.But then, he might well think differently, had he been eating oatmeal, weeds, and the occasional rat.Aye, it is, Major, I thank ye.Fraser dabbed up a bit of wine sauce and brought the last bite to his lips, making no demur when Grey signaled MacKay to bring back the platter.Monsieur Arouet wouldna appreciate such an excellent meal, Im afraid, Fraser said, shaking his head as he helped himself to more mutton.I should expect a man so feted in French society to have somewhat more exacting tastes, Grey answered dryly.Half his own meal remained on his plate, destined for the supper of the cat Augustus.Fraser laughed.Scarcely that, Major, he assured Grey.I have never seen Monsieur Arouet consume anything beyond a glass of water and a dry biscuit, no matter how lavish the occasion.Hes a weazened wee scrap of a man, ye ken, and a martyr to the indigestion.Indeed?Grey was fascinated.Perhaps that explains the cynicism of some of the sentiments I have seen expressed in his plays.Or do you not think that the character of an author shows in the construction of his work?Given some of the characters that I have seen appear in plays and novels, Major, I should think the author a bit depraved who drew them entirely from himself, no?I suppose that is so, Grey answered, smiling at the thought of some of the more extreme fictional characters with whom he was acquainted.Though if an author constructs these colorful personages from life, rather than from the depths of imagination, surely he must boast a most varied acquaintance!Fraser nodded, brushing crumbs from his lap with the linen napkin.It was not Monsieur Arouet, but a colleague of hisa lady novelistwho remarked to me once that writing novels was a cannibals art, in which one often mixed small portions of ones friends and ones enemies together, seasoned them with imagination, and allowed the whole to stew together into a savory concoction.Grey laughed at the description, and beckoned to MacKay to take away the plates and bring in the decanters of port and sherry.A delightful description, indeed!Speaking of cannibals, though, have you chanced to be acquainted with Mr.Defoes Robinson Crusoe?It has been a favorite of mine since boyhood.The conversation turned then to romances, and the excitement of the tropics.It was very late indeed when Fraser returned to his cell, leaving Major Grey entertained, but no wiser concerning either the source or the disposition of the wanderers gold.April 2, 1755  John Grey opened the packet of quills his mother had sent from London.Swans quills, both finer and stronger than common goose quills.He smiled faintly at the sight of them; an unsubtle reminder that his correspondence was in arrears.His mother would have to wait until tomorrow, though.He took out the small, monogrammed penknife he always carried, and slowly trimmed a quill to his liking, composing in his mind what he meant to say.By the time he dipped his quill into the ink, the words were clear in his mind, and he wrote quickly, seldom pausing.2 April, 1755  To Harold, Lord Melton, Earl of Moray  My dear Hal, he wrote, I write to inform you of a recent occurrence which has much engaged my attention.It may amount in the end to nothing, but if there be any substance in the matter, it is of great import.The details of the wandering mans appearance, and the report of his ravings followed swiftly, but Grey found himself slowing as he told of Frasers escape and recapture.The fact that Fraser vanished from the precincts of the prison so soon following these events suggests strongly to me that there was in truth some substance in the vagrants words.If this were the case, however, I find myself at a loss to account for Frasers subsequent actions.He was recaptured within three days of his escape, at a point no more than a mile from the coast.The country side beyond the prison is deserted for a great many miles beyond the village of Ardsmuir, and there is little likelihood of his meeting with a confederate to whom he might pass word of the treasure.Every house in the village has been searched, as was Fraser himself, with no trace discovered of any gold.It is a remote district, and I am reasonably sure that he communicated with no one outside the prison prior to his escapeI am positive that he has not done so since, for he is closely watched.Grey stopped, seeing once more the windswept figure of James Fraser, wild as the red stags and as much at home on the moor as one of them.He had not the slightest doubt that Fraser could have eluded the dragoons easily, had he so chosen, but he had not.He had deliberately allowed himself to be recaptured.Why?He resumed writing, more slowly.It may be, of course, that Fraser failed to find the treasure, or that such a treasure does not exist.I find myself somewhat inclined to this belief, for if he were in possession of a great sum, surely he would have departed from the district at once?He is a strong man, well accustomed to rough living, and entirely capable, I believe, of making his way overland to some point on the coast from which he might make an escape by sea.Grey bit the end of the quill gently, tasting ink.He made a face at the bitterness, rose, and spat out the window.He stood there for a minute, looking out into the cold spring night, absently wiping his mouth.It had finally occurred to him to ask; not the question he had been asking all along, but the more important one.He had done it at the conclusion of a game of chess, which Fraser had won.The guard was standing at the door, ready to escort Fraser back to his cell; as the prisoner had risen from his seat, Grey had stood up, too.I shall not ask you again why you left the prison, he had said, calmly conversational.But I will ask youwhy did you come back?Fraser had frozen briefly, startled.He turned back and met Greys eyes directly.For a moment he said nothing.Then his mouth curled up in a smile.I suppose I must value the company, Major; I can tell ye, its not the food.Grey snorted slightly, remembering.Unable to think of a suitable response, he had allowed Fraser to leave.It was only later that night that he had laboriously arrived at an answer, at last having had the wit to ask questions of himself, rather than of Fraser.What would he, Grey, have done, had Fraser not returned?The answer was that his next step would have been an inquiry into Frasers family connections, in case the man had sought refuge or help from them.And that, he was fairly sure, was the answer.Grey had not taken part in the subjugation of the Highlandshe had been posted to Italy and Francebut he had heard more than enough of that particular campaign.He had seen the blackened stones of too many charred cottages, rising like cairns amid the ruined fields, as he traveled north to Ardsmuir.The fierce loyalties of the Scottish Highlanders were legendary.A Highlander who had seen those cots in flames might well choose to suffer prison, irons, or even flogging, to save his family a visitation from English soldiers.Grey sat and took up his quill, dipping it afresh.You will know, I think, the mettle of the Scots, he wrote.That one in particular, he thought wryly.It is unlikely that any force or threat I can exert will induce Fraser to reveal the whereabouts of the goldshould it exist, and if it does not, I can still less expect any threat to be effective!I have instead chosen to begin a formal acquaintance with Fraser, in his capacity as chief of the Scottish prisoners, in hopes of surprising some clue from his conversation.So far, I have gained nothing from this process.One further avenue of approach suggests itself, however.For obvious reasons, he went on, writing slowly as he formed the thought, I do not wish to make this matter known officially.To call attention to a hoard that might well prove to be chimerical was dangerous; the chance of disappointment was too great.Time enough, if the gold were found, to inform his superiors and collect his deserved rewardescape from Ardsmuir; a posting back to civilization.Therefore I approach you, dear brother, and ask for your help in discovering what particulars may obtain regarding the family of James Fraser.I pray you, do not let anyone be alarmed by your inquiries; if such family connections exist, I would have them ignorant of my interest for the present.My deepest thanks for any efforts you may be able to exert on my behalf, and believe me always,  He dipped the pen once more and signed with a small flourish,   Your humble servant and most affectionate brother,  John William Grey.May 15, 1755  The men sick of la grippe, Grey inquired, how do they fare?Dinner was over, and with it their conversation of books.Now it was time for business.Fraser frowned over the single glass of sherry that was all he would accept in the way of drink.He still had not tasted it, though dinner had been over for some time.None so well.I have more than sixty men ill, fifteen of them verra badly off.He hesitated.Might I ask  I can promise nothing, Mr.Fraser, but you may ask, Grey answered formally.He had barely sipped his own sherry, nor more than tasted his dinner; his stomach had been knotted with anticipation all day.Jamie paused a moment longer, calculating his chances.He wouldnt get everything; he must try for what was most important, but leave Grey room to reject some requests.We have need of more blankets, Major, more fires, and more food.And medicines.Grey swirled the sherry in his cup, watching the light from the fire play in the vortex.Ordinary business first, he reminded himself.Time enough for the other, later.We have no more than twenty spare blankets in store, he answered, but you may have those for the use of the very sick.I fear I cannot augment the ration of food; the rat spoilage has been considerable, and we lost a great quantity of meal in the collapse of the storeroom two months ago.We have limited resources, and  It is not so much a question of more, Fraser put in quickly.But rather of the type of food.Those who are most ill cannot readily digest the bread and parritch.Perhaps a substitution of some sort might be arranged?Each man was given, by law, a quart of oatmeal parritch and a small wheaten loaf each day.Thin barley brose supplemented this twice each week, with a quart of meat stew added on Sunday, to sustain the needs of men working at manual labor for twelve to sixteen hours per day.Grey raised one eyebrow.What are you suggesting, Mr.Fraser?I assume that the prison does have some allowance for the purchase of salt beef, turnips and onions, for the Sunday stew?Yes, but that allowance must provide for the next quarters supplies.Then what I suggest, Major, is that you might use that money now to provide broth and stew for those who are sick.Those of us who are hale will willingly forgo our share of meat for the quarter.Grey frowned.But will the prisoners not be weakened, with no meat at all?Will they not be unable to work?Those who die of the grippe will assuredly not work, Fraser pointed out acerbically.Grey snorted briefly.True.But those of you who remain healthy will not be healthy long, if you give up your rations for so long a time.He shook his head.No, Mr.Fraser, I think not.It is better to let the sick take their chances than to risk many more falling ill.Fraser was a stubborn man.He lowered his head for a moment, then looked up to try again.Then I would ask your leave to hunt for ourselves, Major, if the Crown cannot supply us with adequate food.Hunt?Greys fair brows rose in astonishment.Give you weapons and allow you to wander the moors?Gods teeth, Mr.Fraser!I think God doesna suffer much from the scurvy, Major, Jamie said dryly.His teeth are in no danger.He saw the twitch of Greys mouth and relaxed slightly.Grey always tried to suppress his sense of humor, no doubt feeling that put him at a disadvantage.In his dealings with Jamie Fraser, it did.Emboldened by that telltale twitch, Jamie pressed on.Not weapons, Major.And not wandering.Will ye give us leave to set snares upon the moor when we cut peats, though?And to keep such meat as we take?A prisoner would now and then contrive a snare as it was, but as often as not, the catch would be taken from him by the guards.Grey drew a deep breath and blew it out slowly, considering.Snares?Would you not require materials for the construction of these snares, Mr.Fraser?Only a bit of string, Major, Jamie assured him.A dozen balls, no more, of any sort of twine or string, and ye may leave the rest to us.Grey rubbed slowly at his cheek in contemplation, then nodded.Very well.The Major turned to the small secretary, plucked the quill out of its inkwell and made a note.I shall give orders to that effect tomorrow.Now, as to the rest of your requests  A quarter hour later, it was settled.Jamie sat back at last, sighing, and finally took a sip of his sherry.He considered that he had earned it.He had permission not only for the snares, but for the peat cutters to work an extra half hour per day, the extra peats to provide for an additional small fire in each cell.No medicines were to be had, but he had leave for Sutherland to send a message to a cousin in Ullapool, whose husband was an apothecary.If the cousins husband were willing to send medicines, the prisoners could have them.A decent evenings work, Jamie thought.He took another sip of sherry and closed his eyes, enjoying the warmth of the fire against his cheek.Grey watched his guest beneath lowered lids, seeing the broad shoulders slump a little, tension eased now that their business was finished.Or so Fraser thought.Very good, Grey thought to himself.Yes, drink your sherry and relax.I want you thoroughly off guard.He leaned forward to pick up the decanter, and felt the crackle of Hals letter in his breast pocket.His heart began to beat faster.Will you not take a drop more, Mr.Fraser?And tell mehow does your sister fare these days?He saw Frasers eyes spring open, and his face whiten with shock.How are matters there atLallybroch, they call it, do they not?Grey pushed aside the decanter, keeping his eyes fixed on his guest.I could not say, Major.Frasers voice was even, but his eyes were narrowed to slits.No?But I daresay they do very well these days, what with the gold you have provided them.The broad shoulders tightened suddenly, bunched under the shabby coat.Grey carelessly picked up one of the chessmen from the nearby board, tossing it casually from one hand to the other.I suppose Ianyour brother in law is named Ian, I think?will know how to make good use of it.Fraser had himself under control again.The dark blue eyes met Greys directly.Since you are so well informed as to my connections, Major, he said evenly, I must suppose that you also are aware that my home lies well over a hundred miles from Ardsmuir.Perhaps you will explain how I might have traveled that distance twice within the space of three days?Greys eyes stayed on the chess piece, rolling idly from hand to hand.It was a pawn, a cone headed little warrior with a fierce face, carved from a cylinder of walrus ivory.You might have met someone upon the moor who would have borne word of the goldor borne the gold itselfto your family.Fraser snorted briefly.On Ardsmuir?How likely is it, Major, that I should by happenstance encounter a person known to me on that moor?Much less that it should be a person whom I would trust to convey a message such as you suggest?He set down his glass with finality.I met no one on the moor, Major.And should I trust your word to that effect, Mr.Fraser?Grey allowed considerable skepticism to show in his voice.He glanced up, brows raised.Frasers high cheekbones flushed slightly.No one has ever had cause to doubt my word, Major, he said stiffly.Have they not, indeed?Grey was not altogether feigning his anger.I believe you gave me your word, upon the occasion of my ordering your irons stricken off!And I kept it!Did you?The two men sat upright, glaring at each other over the table.You asked three things of me, Major, and I have kept that bargain in every particular!Grey gave a contemptuous snort.Indeed, Mr.Fraser?And if that is so, pray what was it caused you suddenly to despise the company of your fellows and seek congress with the coneys on the moor?Since you assure me that you met no one elseyou give me your word that it is so.This last was spoken with an audible sneer that brought the color surging into Frasers face.One of the big hands curled slowly into a fist.Aye, Major, he said softly.I give ye my word that that is so.He seemed to realize at this point that his fist was clenched; very slowly, he unfolded it, laying his hand flat on the table.And as to your escape?And as to my escape, Major, I have told you that I will say nothing.Fraser exhaled slowly and sat back in his chair, eyes fixed on Grey under thick, ruddy brows.Grey paused for a moment, then sat back himself, setting the chess piece on the table.Let me speak plainly, Mr.Fraser.I do you the honor of assuming you to be a sensible man.I am deeply sensible of the honor, Major, I do assure you.Grey heard the irony, but did not respond; he held the upper hand now.The fact is, Mr.Fraser, that it is of no consequence whether you did in fact communicate with your family regarding the matter of the gold.You might have done so.That possibility alone is sufficient to warrant my sending a party of dragoons to search the premises of Lallybrochthoroughlyand to arrest and interrogate the members of your family.He reached into his breast pocket and withdrew a piece of paper.Unfolding it, he read the list of names.Ian Murrayyour brother in law, I collect?His wife, Janet.That would be your sister, of course.Their children, Jamesnamed for his uncle, perhaps?he glanced up briefly, long enough to catch a glimpse of Frasers face, than returned to his listMargaret, Katherine, Janet, Michael, and Ian.Quite a brood, he said, in a tone of dismissal that equated the six younger Murrays with a litter of piglets.He laid the list on the table beside the chess piece.The three eldest children are old enough to be arrested and interrogated with their parents, you know.Such interrogations are frequently ungentle, Mr.Fraser.In this, he spoke no less than the truth, and Fraser knew it.All color had faded from the prisoners face, leaving the strong bones stark under the skin.He closed his eyes briefly, then opened them.Grey had a brief memory of Quarrys voice, saying If you dine alone with the man, dont turn your back on him.The hair rose briefly on the back of his neck, but he controlled himself, returning Frasers blue stare.What do you want of me?The voice was low, and hoarse with fury, but the Scot sat motionless, a figure carved in cinnabar, gilded by the flame.Grey took a deep breath.I want the truth, he said softly.There was no sound in the chamber save the pop and hiss of the peats in the grate.There was a flicker of movement from Fraser, no more than the twitch of his fingers against his leg, and then nothing.The Scot sat, head turned, staring into the fire as though he sought an answer there.Grey sat quietly, waiting.He could afford to wait.At last, Fraser turned back to face him.The truth, then.He took a deep breath; Grey could see the breast of his linen shirt swell with ithe had no waistcoat.I kept my word, Major.I told ye faithfully all that the man said to me that night.What I didna tell ye was that some of what he said had meaning to me.Indeed.Grey held himself still, scarcely daring to move.And what meaning was that?Frasers wide mouth compressed to a thin line.Ispoke to you of my wife, he said, forcing the words out as though they hurt him.Yes, you said that she was dead.I said that she was gone, Major, Fraser corrected softly.His eyes were fixed on the pawn.It is likely she is dead, but He stopped and swallowed, then went on more firmly.My wife was a healer.What they call in the Highlands a charmer, but more than that.She was a white ladya wisewoman.He glanced up briefly.The word in Gaelic is ban druidh; it also means witch.The white witch.Grey also spoke softly, but excitement was thrumming through his blood.So the mans words referred to your wife?I thought they might.And if so The wide shoulders stirred in a slight shrug.I had to go, he said simply.To see.How did you know where to go?Was that also something you gleaned from the vagrants words?Grey leaned forward slightly, curious.Fraser nodded, eyes still fixed on the ivory chess piece.There is a spot I knew of, not too far distant from this place, where there is a shrine to St.Bride.St.Bride was also called the white lady, he explained, looking up.Though the shrine has been there a verra long timesince long before St.Bride came to Scotland.I see.And so you assumed that the mans words referred to this spot, as well as to your wife?Again the shrug.I did not know, Fraser repeated.I couldna say whether he meant anything to do with my wife, or whether the white witch only meant St.Bridewas only meant to direct me to the placeor perhaps neither.But I felt I must go.He described the place in question, and at Greys prodding, gave directions for reaching it.The shrine itself is a small stone in the shape of an ancient cross, so weathered that the markings scarce show on it.It stands above a small pool, half buried in the heather.Ye can find small white stones in the pool, tangled among the roots of the heather that grows on the bank.The stones are thought to have great powers, Major, he explained, seeing the others blank look.But only when used by a white lady.I see.And your wife?Grey paused delicately.Fraser shook his head briefly.There was nothing there to do with her, he said softly.She is truly gone.His voice was low and controlled, but Grey could hear the undertone of desolation.Frasers face was normally calm and unreadable; he did not change expression now, but the marks of grief were clear, etched in the lines beside mouth and eyes, thrown into darkness by the flickering fire.It seemed an intrusion to break in upon such a depth of feeling, unstated though it was, but Grey had his duty.And the gold, Mr.Fraser?he asked quietly.What of that?Fraser heaved a deep sigh.It was there, he said flatly.What!Grey sat bolt upright in his chair, staring at the Scot.You found it?Fraser glanced up at him then, and his mouth twisted wryly.I found it.Was it indeed the French gold that Louis sent for Charles Stuart?Excitement was racing through Greys bloodstream, with visions of himself delivering great chests of gold louis dor to his superiors in London.Louis never sent gold to the Stuarts, Fraser said, with certainty.No, Major, what I found at the saints pool was gold, but not French coin.What he had found was a small box, containing a few gold and silver coins, and a small leather pouch, filled with jewels.Jewels?Grey blurted.Where the devil did they come from?Fraser cast him a glance of mild exasperation.I havena the slightest notion, Major, he said.How should I know?No, of course not, Grey said, coughing to cover his flusterment.Certainly.But this treasurewhere is it now?I threw it into the sea.Grey stared blankly at him.Youwhat?I threw it into the sea, Fraser repeated patiently.The slanted blue eyes met Greys steadily.Yell maybe have heard of a place called the Devils Cauldron, Major?Its no more than half a mile from the saints pool.Why?Why would you have done such a thing?Grey demanded.It isnt sense, man!I wasna much concerned with sense at the time, Major, Fraser said softly.I had gone there hopingand with that hope gone, the treasure seemed no more to me than a wee box of stones and bits of tarnished metal.I had no use for it.He looked up, one brow slightly raised in irony.But I didna see the sense in giving it to King Geordie, either.So I flung it into the sea.Grey sat back in his chair and mechanically poured out another cup of sherry, hardly noticing what he was doing.His thoughts were in turmoil.Fraser sat, head turned away and chin propped on his fist, gazing into the fire, his face gone back to its usual impassivity.The light glowed behind him, lighting the long, straight line of his nose and the soft curve of his lip, shadowing jaw and brow with sternness.Grey took a good sized swallow of his drink and steadied himself.It is a moving story, Mr.Fraser, he said levelly.Most dramatic.And yet there is no evidence that it is the truth.Fraser stirred, turning his head to look at Grey.Jamies slanted eyes narrowed, in what might have been amusement.Aye, there is, Major, he said.He reached under the waistband of his ragged breeches, fumbled for a moment, and held out his hand above the tabletop, waiting.Grey extended his own hand in reflex, and a small object dropped into his open palm.It was a sapphire, dark blue as Frasers own eyes, and a good size, too.Grey opened his mouth, but said nothing, choked with astonishment.There is your evidence that the treasure existed, Major.Fraser nodded toward the stone in Greys hand.His eyes met Greys across the tabletop.And as for the restI am sorry to say, Major, that ye must take my word for it.Butbutyou said  I did.Fraser was as calm as though they had been discussing the rain outside.I kept that one wee stone, thinking that it might be some use, if I were ever to be freed, or that I might find some chance of sending it to my family.For yell appreciate, Majora light glinted derisively in Jamies blue eyesthat my family couldna make use of a treasure of that sort, without attracting a deal of unwelcome attention.One stone, perhaps, but not a great many of them.Grey could scarcely think.What Fraser said was true; a Highland farmer like his brother in law would have no way of turning such a treasure into money without causing talk that would bring down the Kings men on Lallybroch in short order.And Fraser himself might well be imprisoned for the rest of his life.But still, to toss away a fortune so lightly!And yet, looking at the Scot, he could well believe it.If ever there was a man whose judgment would not be distorted by greed, James Fraser was it.Still  How did you keep this by you?Grey demanded abruptly.You were searched to the skin when you were brought back.The wide mouth curved slightly in the first genuine smile Grey had seen.I swallowed it, Fraser said.Greys hand closed convulsively on the sapphire.He opened his hand and rather gingerly set the gleaming blue thing on the table by the chess piece.I see, he said.Im sure ye do, Major, said Fraser, with a gravity that merely made the glint of amusement in his eyes more pronounced.A diet of rough parritch has its advantages, now and again.Grey quelled the sudden urge to laugh, rubbing a finger hard over his lip.Im sure it does, Mr.Fraser.He sat for a moment, contemplating the blue stone.Then he looked up abruptly.You are a Papist, Mr.Fraser?He knew the answer already; there were few adherents of the Catholic Stuarts who were not.Without waiting for a reply, he rose and went to the bookshelf in the corner.It took a moment to find; a gift from his mother, it was not part of his usual reading.He laid the calf bound Bible on the table, next to the stone.I am myself inclined to accept your word as a gentleman, Mr.Fraser, he said.But you will understand that I have my duty to consider.Fraser gazed at the book for a long moment, then looked up at Grey, his expression unreadable.Aye, I ken that fine, Major, he said quietly.Without hesitation, he laid a broad hand on the Bible.I swear in the name of Almighty God and by His Holy Word, he said firmly.The treasure is as I told you.His eyes glowed in the firelight, dark and unfathomable.And I swear on my hope of heaven, he added softly, that it rests now in the sea.11  THE TORREMOLINOS GAMBIT  With the question of the French gold thus settled, they returned to what had become their routine; a brief period of formal negotiation over the affairs of the prisoners, followed by informal conversation and sometimes a game of chess.This evening, they had come from the dinner table, still discussing Samuel Richardsons immense novel Pamela.Do you think that the size of the book is justified by the complexity of the story?Grey asked, leaning forward to light a cheroot from the candle on the sideboard.It must after all be a great expense to the publisher, as well as requiring a substantial effort from the reader, a book of that length.Fraser smiled.He did not smoke himself, but had chosen to drink port this evening, claiming that to be the only drink whose taste would be unaffected by the stink of tobacco.What is ittwelve hundred pages?Aye, I think so.After all, it is difficult to sum up the complications of a life in a short space with any hope of constructing an accurate account.True.I have heard the point made, though, that the novelists skill lies in the artful selection of detail.Do you not suppose that a volume of such length may indicate a lack of discipline in such selection, and hence a lack of skill?Fraser considered, sipping the ruby liquid slowly.I have seen books where that is the case, to be sure, he said.An author seeks by sheer inundation of detail to overwhelm the reader into belief.In this case, however, I think it isna so.Each character is most carefully considered, and all the incidents chosen seem necessary to the story.No, I think it is true that some stories simply require a greater space in which to be told.He took another sip and laughed.Of course, I admit to some prejudice in that regard, Major.Given the circumstances under which I read Pamela, I should have been delighted had the book been twice as long as it was.And what circumstances were those?Grey pursed his lips and blew a careful smoke ring that floated toward the ceiling.I lived in a cave in the Highlands for several years, Major, Fraser said wryly.I seldom had more than three books with me, and those must last me for months at a time.Aye, Im partial to lengthy tomes, but I must admit that it is not a universal preference.Thats certainly true, Grey agreed.He squinted, following the track of the first smoke ring, and blew another.Just off target, it drifted to the side.I remember, he continued, sucking fiercely on his cheroot, encouraging it to draw, a friend of my motherssaw the bookin Mothers drawing room He drew deeply, and blew once more, giving a small grunt of satisfaction as the new ring struck the old, dispersing it into a tiny cloud.Lady Hensley, it was.She picked up the book, looked at it in that helpless way so many females affect and said, Oh, Countess!You are so courageous to attack a novel of such stupendous size.I fear I should never dare to start so lengthy a book myself.Grey cleared his throat and lowered his voice from the falsetto he had affected for Lady Hensley.To which Mother replied, he went on in his normal voice, Dont worry about it for a moment, my dear; you wouldnt understand it anyway.Fraser laughed, then coughed, waving away the remnants of another smoke ring.Grey quickly snuffed out the cheroot, and rose from his seat.Come along then; weve just time for a quick game.They were not evenly matched; Fraser was much the better player, but Grey could now and then contrive to rescue a match through sheer bravado of play.Tonight, he tried the Torremolinos Gambit.It was a risky opening, a queens knight opening.Successfully launched, it paved the way for an unusual combination of rook and bishop, depending for its success upon a piece of misdirection by the kings knight and king bishops pawn.Grey used it seldom, for it was a trick that would not work on a mediocre player, one not sharp enough to detect the knights threat, or its possibilities.It was a gambit for use against a shrewd and subtle mind, and after nearly three months of weekly games, Grey knew quite well what sort of mind he was facing across the tinted ivory squares.He forced himself not to hold his breath as he made the next to final move of the combination.He felt Frasers eyes rest on him briefly, but didnt meet them, for fear of betraying his excitement.Instead, he reached to the sideboard for the decanter, and refilled both glasses with the sweet dark port, keeping his eyes carefully on the rising liquid.Would it be the pawn, or the knight?Frasers head was bent over the board in contemplation, small reddish lights winking in his hair as he moved slightly.The knight, and all was well; it would be too late.The pawn, and all was likely lost.Grey could feel his heart beating heavily behind his breastbone as he waited.Frasers hand hovered over the board, then suddenly decided, swooped down and touched the piece.The knight.He must have let his breath out too noisily, for Fraser glanced sharply up at him, but it was too late.Careful to keep any overt expression of triumph off his face, Grey castled.Fraser frowned at the board for a long moment, eyes flicking among the pieces, assessing.Then he jerked slightly, seeing it, and looked up, eyes wide.Why ye cunning wee bastard!he said, in a tone of surprised respect.Where in the bloody hell did ye learn that trick?My elder brother taught it to me, Grey answered, losing his customary wariness in a rush of delight at his success.He normally beat Fraser no more than three times in ten, and victory was sweet.Fraser uttered a short laugh, and reaching out a long index finger, delicately tipped his king over.I should have expected something like that from a man like my Lord Melton, he observed casually.Grey stiffened in his seat.Fraser saw the movement, and arched one brow quizzically.It is Lord Melton ye mean, is it not?he said.Or perhaps you have another brother?No, Grey said.His lips felt slightly numb, though that might only be the cheroot.No, I have only one brother.His heart had begun to pound again, but this time with a heavy, dull beat.Had the Scottish bastard remembered all the time who he was?Our meeting was necessarily rather brief, the Scot said dryly.But memorable.He picked up his glass and took a drink, watching Grey across the crystal rim.Perhaps ye didna know that I had met Lord Melton, on Culloden Field?I knew.I fought at Culloden.All Greys pleasure in his victory had evaporated.He felt slightly nauseated from the smoke.I didnt know that you would recall Hal, thoughor know of the relationship between us.As I have that meeting to thank for my life, I am not likely to forget it, Fraser said dryly.Grey looked up.I understand that you were not so thankful when Hal met you at Culloden.The line of Frasers mouth tightened, then relaxed.No, he said softly.He smiled without humor.Your brother verra stubbornly refused to shoot me.I wasna inclined to be grateful for the favor at the time.You wished to be shot?Greys eyebrows rose.The Scots eyes were remote, fixed on the chessboard, but clearly seeing something else.I thought I had reason, he said softly.At the time.What reason?Grey asked.He caught a gimlet glance and added hastily, I mean no impertinence in asking.It is onlyat that time, II felt similarly.From what you have said of the Stuarts, I cannot think that the loss of their cause would have led you to such despair.There was a faint flicker near Frasers mouth, much too faint to be called a smile.He inclined his head briefly, in acknowledgment.There were those who fought for love of Charles Stuartor from loyalty to his fathers right of kingship.But you are right; I wasna one of those.He didnt explain further.Grey took a deep breath, keeping his eyes fixed on the board.I said that I felt much as you did, at the time.Ilost a particular friend at Culloden, he said.With half his mind he wondered why he should speak of Hector to this man, of all men; a Scottish warrior who had slashed his way across that deadly field, whose sword might well have been the oneAt the same time, he could not help but speak; there was no one to whom he could speak of Hector, save this man, this prisoner who could speak to no one else, whose words could do him no damage.He made me go and look at the bodyHal did, my brother, Grey blurted.He looked down at his hand, where the deep blue of Hectors sapphire burned against his skin, a smaller version of the one Fraser had reluctantly given him.He said that I must; that unless I saw him dead, I should never really believe it.That unless I knew Hectormy friendwas really gone, I would grieve forever.If I saw, and knew, I would grieve, but then I should healand forget.He looked up, with a painful attempt at a smile.Hal is generally right, but not always.Perhaps he had healed, but he would never forget.Certainly he would not forget his last sight of Hector, lying wax faced and still in the early morning light, long dark lashes resting delicately on his cheeks as they did when he slept.And the gaping wound that had half severed his head from his body, leaving the windpipe and large vessels of the neck exposed in butchery.They sat silent for a moment.Fraser said nothing, but picked up his glass and drained it.Without asking, Grey refilled both glasses for the third time.He leaned back in his chair, looking curiously at his guest.Do you find your life greatly burdensome, Mr.Fraser?The Scot looked up then, and met his eyes with a long, level gaze.Evidently, Fraser found nothing in his own face save curiosity, for the broad shoulders across the board relaxed their tension somewhat, and the wide mouth softened its grim line.The Scot leaned back, and flexed his right hand slowly, opening and closing it to stretch the muscles.Grey saw that the hand had been damaged at one time; small scars were visible in the firelight, and two of the fingers were set stiffly.Perhaps not greatly so, the Scot replied slowly.He met Greys eyes with dispassion.I think perhaps the greatest burden lies in caring for those we cannot help.Not in having no one for whom to care?Fraser paused before answering; he might have been weighing the position of the pieces on the table.That is emptiness, he said at last, softly.But no great burden.It was late; there was no sound from the fortress around them save the occasional step of the soldier on sentry in the courtyard below.Your wifeshe was a healer, you said?She was.Sheher name was Claire.Fraser swallowed, then lifted his cup and drank, as though trying to dislodge something stuck in his throat.You cared very much for her, I think?Grey said softly.He recognized in the Scot the same compulsion he had had a few moments earlierthe need to speak a name kept hidden, to bring back for a moment the ghost of a love.I had meant to thank you sometime, Major, the Scot said softly.Grey was startled.Thank me?For what?The Scot looked up, eyes dark over the finished game.For that night at Carryarrick where we first met.His eyes were steady on Greys.For what ye did for my wife.You remembered, Grey said hoarsely.I hadna forgotten, Fraser said simply.Grey steeled himself to look across the table, but when he did so, he found no hint of laughter in the slanted blue eyes.Fraser nodded at him, gravely formal.Ye were a worthy foe, Major; I wouldna forget you.John Grey laughed bitterly.Oddly enough, he felt less upset than he had thought he would, at having the shameful memory so explicitly recalled.If you found a sixteen year old shitting himself with fear a worthy foe, Mr.Fraser, then it is little wonder that the Highland army was defeated!Fraser smiled faintly.A man that doesna shit himself with a pistol held to his head, Major, has either no bowels, or no brains.Despite himself, Grey laughed.One edge of Frasers mouth turned slightly up.Ye wouldna speak to save your own life, but ye would do it to save a ladys honor.The honor of my own lady, Fraser said softly.That doesna seem like cowardice to me.The ring of truth was too evident in the Scots voice to mistake or ignore.I did nothing for your wife, Grey said, rather bitterly.She was in no danger, after all!Ye didna ken that, aye?Fraser pointed out.Ye thought to save her life and virtue, at the risk of your own.Ye did her honor by the notionand I have thought of it now and again, since Isince I lost her.The hesitation in Frasers voice was slight; only the tightening of the muscles in his throat betrayed his emotion.I see.Grey breathed deep, and let it out slowly.I am sorry for your loss, he added formally.They were both quiet for a moment, alone with their ghosts.Then Fraser looked up and drew in his breath.Your brother was right, Major, he said.I thank ye, and Ill bid ye good een.He rose, set down his cup and left the room.It reminded him in some ways of his years in the cave, with his visits to the house, those oases of life and warmth in the desert of solitude.Here, it was the reverse, going from the crowded, cold squalor of the cells up to the Majors glowing suite, able for a few hours to stretch both mind and body, to relax in warmth and conversation and the abundance of food.It gave him the same odd sense of dislocation, though; that sense of losing some valuable part of himself that could not survive the passage back to daily life.Each time, the passage became more difficult.He stood in the drafty passageway, waiting for the turnkey to unlock the cell door.The sounds of sleeping men buzzed in his ears and the smell of them wafted out as the door opened, pungent as a fart.He filled his lungs with a quick deep breath, and ducked his head to enter.There was a stir among the bodies on the floor as he stepped into the room, his shadow falling black across the prone and bundled shapes.The door swung closed behind him, leaving the cell in darkness, but there was a ripple of awareness through the room, as men stirred awake to his coming.Youre back late, Mac Dubh, said Murdo Lindsay, voice rusty with sleep.Yell be sair tuckered tomorrow.Ill manage, Murdo, he whispered, stepping over bodies.He pulled off his coat and laid it carefully over the bench, then took up the rough blanket and sought his space on the floor, his long shadow flickering across the moon barred window.Ronnie Sinclair turned over as Mac Dubh lay down beside him.He blinked sleepily, sandy lashes nearly invisible in the moonlight.Did Wee Goldie feed ye decent, Mac Dubh?He did, Ronnie, thank ye.He shifted on the stones, seeking a comfortable position.Yell tell us about it tomorrow?The prisoners took an odd pleasure in hearing what he had been served for dinner, taking it as an honor that their chief should be well fed.Aye, I will, Ronnie, Mac Dubh promised.But I must sleep now, aye?Sleep well, Mac Dubh, came a whisper from the corner where Hayes was rolled up, curled like a set of teaspoons with MacLeod, Innes, and Keith, who all liked to sleep warm.Sweet dreams, Gavin, Mac Dubh whispered back, and little by little, the cell settled back into silence.He dreamed of Claire that night.She lay in his arms, heavy limbed and fragrant.She was with child; her belly round and smooth as a muskmelon, her breasts rich and full, the nipples dark as wine, urging him to taste them.Her hand cupped itself between his legs, and he reached to return the favor, the small, fat softness of her filling his hand, pressing against him as she moved.She rose over him, smiling, her hair falling down around her face, and threw her leg across him.Give me your mouth, he whispered, not knowing whether he meant to kiss her or to have her take him between her lips, only knowing he must have her somehow.Give me yours, she said.She laughed and leaned down to him, hands on his shoulders, her hair brushing his face with the scent of moss and sunlight, and he felt the prickle of dry leaves against his back and knew they lay in the glen near Lallybroch, and her the color of the copper beeches all around; beech leaves and beechwood, gold eyes and a smooth white skin, skimmed with shadows.Then her breast pressed against his mouth, and he took it eagerly, drawing her body tight against him as he suckled her.Her milk was hot and sweet, with a faint taste of silver, like a deers blood.Harder, she whispered to him, and put her hand behind his head, gripping the back of his neck, pressing him to her.Harder.She lay at her length upon him, his hands holding for dear life to the sweet flesh of her buttocks, feeling the small solid weight of the child upon his own belly, as though they shared it now, protecting the small round thing between their bodies.He flung his arms about her, tight, and she held him tight as he jerked and shuddered, her hair in his face, her hands in his hair and the child between them, not knowing where any of the three of them began or ended.He came awake suddenly, panting and sweating, half curled on his side beneath one of the benches in the cell.It was not yet quite light, but he could see the shapes of the men who lay near him, and hoped he had not cried out.He closed his eyes at once, but the dream was gone.He lay quite still, his heart slowing, and waited for the dawn.June 18, 1755  John Grey had dressed carefully this evening, with fresh linen and silk stockings.He wore his own hair, simply plaited, rinsed with a tonic of lemon verbena.He had hesitated for a moment over Hectors ring, but at last had put it on, too.The dinner had been good; a pheasant he had shot himself, and a salad of greens, in deference to Frasers odd tastes for such things.Now they sat over the chessboard, lighter topics of conversation set aside in the concentration of the midgame.Will you have sherry?He set down his bishop, and leaned back, stretching.Fraser nodded, absorbed in the new position.I thank ye.Grey rose and crossed the room, leaving Fraser by the fire.He reached into the cupboard for the bottle, and felt a thin trickle of sweat run down his ribs as he did so.Not from the fire, simmering across the room; from sheer nervousness.He brought the bottle back to the table, holding the goblets in his other hand; the Waterford crystal his mother had sent.The liquid purled into the glasses, shimmering amber and rose in the firelight.Frasers eyes were fixed on the cup, watching the rising sherry, but with an abstraction that showed he was deep in his thoughts.The dark blue eyes were hooded.Grey wondered what he was thinking; not about the gamethe outcome of that was certain.Grey reached out and moved his queens bishop.It was no more than a delaying move, he knew; still, it put Frasers queen in danger, and might force the exchange of a rook.Grey got up to put a brick of peat on the fire.Rising, he stretched himself, and strolled behind his opponent to view the situation from this angle.The firelight shimmered as the big Scot leaned forward to study the board, picking up the deep red tones of James Frasers hair, echoing the glow of the light in the crystalline sherry.Fraser had bound his hair back with a thin black cord, tied in a bow.It would take no more than a slight tug to loosen it.John Grey could imagine running his hand up under that thick, glossy mass, to touch the smooth, warm nape beneath.To touch  His palm closed abruptly, imagining sensation.It is your move, Major.The soft Scots voice brought him to himself again, and he took his seat, viewing the chessboard through sightless eyes.Without really looking, he was intensely aware of the others movements, his presence.There was a disturbance of the air around Fraser; it was impossible not to look at him.To cover his glance, he picked up his sherry glass and sipped, barely noticing the liquid gold taste of it.Fraser sat still as a statue of cinnabar, only the deep blue eyes alive in his face as he studied the board.The fire had burned down, and the lines of his body were limned with shadow.His hand, all gold and black with the light of the fire on it, rested on the table, still and exquisite as the captured pawn beside it.The blue stone in John Greys ring glinted as he reached for his queens bishop.Is it wrong, Hector?he thought.That I should love a man who might have killed you?Or was it a way at last to put things right; to heal the wounds of Culloden for them both?The bishop made a soft thump as he set the felted base down with precision.Without stopping, his hand rose, as though it moved without his volition.The hand traveled the short distance through the air, looking as though it knew precisely what it wanted, and set itself on Frasers, palm tingling, curved fingers gently imploring.The hand under his was warmso warmbut hard, and motionless as marble.Nothing moved on the table but the shimmer of the flame in the heart of the sherry.He lifted his eyes then, to meet Frasers.Take your hand off me, Fraser said, very, very softly.Or I will kill you.The hand under Greys did not move, nor did the face above, but he could feel the shiver of revulsion, a spasm of hatred and disgust that rose from the mans core, radiating through his flesh.Quite suddenly, he heard once more the memory of Quarrys warning, as clearly as though the man spoke in his ear this moment.If you dine with him alonedont turn your back on him.There was no chance of that; he could not turn away.Could not even look away or blink, to break the dark blue gaze that held him frozen.Moving as slowly as though he stood atop an unexploded mine, he drew back his hand.There was a moments silence, broken only by the rains patter and the hissing of the peat fire, when neither of them seemed to breathe.Then Fraser rose without a sound, and left the room.12  SACRIFICE  The rain of late November pattered down on the stones of the courtyard, and on the sullen rows of men, standing huddled under the downpour.The Redcoats who stood on guard over them didnt look much happier than the sodden prisoners.Major Grey stood under the overhang of the roof, waiting.It wasnt the best weather for conducting a search and cleaning of the prisoners cells, but at this time of year, it was futile to wait for good weather.And with more than two hundred prisoners in Ardsmuir, it was necessary to swab the cells at least monthly in order to prevent major outbreaks of illness.The doors to the main cell block swung back, and a small file of prisoners emerged; the trustys who did the actual cleaning, closely watched by the guards.At the end of the line, Corporal Dunstable came out, his hands full of the small bits of contraband a search of this sort usually turned up.The usual rubbish, sir, he reported, dumping the collection of pitiful relics and anonymous junk onto the top of a cask that stood near the Majors elbow.Just this, you might take notice of.This was a small strip of cloth, perhaps six inches by four, in a green tartan check.Dunstable glanced quickly at the lines of standing prisoners, as if intending to catch someone in a telltale action.Grey sighed, then straightened his shoulders.Yes, I suppose so.The possession of any Scottish tartan was strictly forbidden by the Diskilting Act that had likewise disarmed the Highlanders and prevented the wearing of their native dress.He stepped in front of the rows of men, as Corporal Dunstable gave a sharp shout to attract their attention.Whose is this?The corporal raised the scrap high, and raised his voice as well.Grey glanced from the scrap of bright cloth to the row of prisoners, mentally ticking off the names, trying to match them to his imperfect knowledge of tartans.Even within a single clan, the patterns varied so wildly that a given pattern couldnt be assigned with any certainty, but there were general patterns of color and design.MacAlester, Hayes, Innes, Graham, MacMurtry, MacKenzie, MacDonaldstop.MacKenzie.That one.It was more an officers knowledge of men than any identification of the plaid with a particular clan that made him sure.MacKenzie was a young prisoner, and his face was a shade too controlled, too expressionless.Its yours, MacKenzie.Isnt it?Grey demanded.He snatched the scrap of cloth from the corporal and thrust it under the young mans nose.The prisoner was white faced under the blotches of dirt.His jaw was clamped hard, and he was breathing hard through his nose with a faint whistling sound.Grey fixed the young man with a hard, triumphant stare.The young Scot had that core of implacable hate that they all had, but he hadnt managed to build the wall of stoic indifference that held it in.Grey could feel the fear building in the lad; another second and he would break.Its mine.The voice was calm, almost bored, and spoke with such flat indifference that neither MacKenzie nor Grey registered it at once.They stood locked in each others eyes, until a large hand reached over Angus MacKenzies shoulder and gently plucked the scrap of cloth from the officers hand.John Grey stepped back, feeling the words like a blow in the pit of his stomach.MacKenzie forgotten, he lifted his eyes the several inches necessary to look Jamie Fraser in the face.It isnt a Fraser tartan, he said, feeling the words force their way past wooden lips.His whole face felt numb, a fact for which he was dimly grateful; at least his expression couldnt betray him before the ranks of the watching prisoners.Frasers mouth widened slightly.Grey kept his gaze fastened on it, afraid to meet the dark blue eyes above.No, it isnt, Fraser agreed.Its MacKenzie.My mothers clan.In some far off corner of his mind, Grey stored away another tiny scrap of information with the small hoard of facts kept in the jeweled coffer labeled Jamiehis mother was a MacKenzie.He knew that was true, just as he knew that the tartan didnt belong to Fraser.He heard his voice, cool and steady, saying Possession of clan tartans is illegal.You know the penalty, of course?The wide mouth curled in a one sided smile.I do.There was a shifting and a muttering among the ranks of the prisoners; there was little actual movement, but Grey could feel the alignment changing, as though they were in fact drawing toward Fraser, circling him, embracing him.The circle had broken and re formed, and he was alone outside it.Jamie Fraser had gone back to his own.With an effort of will, Grey forced his gaze away from the soft, smooth lips, slightly chapped from exposure to sun and wind.The look in the eyes above them was what he had been afraid of; neither fear nor angerbut indifference.He motioned to a guard.Take him.Major John William Grey bent his head over the work on his desk, signing requisitions without reading them.He seldom worked so late at night, but there had not been time during the day, and the paperwork was piling up.The requisitions must be sent to London this week.Two hundred pound wheat flowr, he wrote, trying to concentrate on the neatness of the black squiggles under his quill.The trouble with such routine paperwork was that it occupied his attention but not his mind, allowing memories of the day to creep in unawares.Six hogsheds ale, for use of barracks.He set down the quill and rubbed his hands briskly together.He could still feel the chill that had settled in his bones in the courtyard that morning.There was a hot fire, but it didnt seem to be helping.He didnt go nearer; he had tried that once, and stood mesmerized, seeing the images of the afternoon in the flames, roused only when the cloth of his breeches began to scorch.He picked up the quill and tried again to banish the sights of the courtyard from his mind.It was better not to delay execution of sentences of this kind; the prisoners became restless and nervy in anticipation and there was considerable difficulty in controlling them.Executed at once, though, such discipline often had a salutary effect, showing the prisoners that retribution would be swift and dire, enhancing their respect for those who held their guardianship.Somehow John Grey suspected that this particular occasion had not much enhanced his prisoners respectfor him, at least.Feeling little more than the trickle of ice water through his veins, he had given his orders, swift and composed, and they had been obeyed with equal competence.The prisoners had been drawn up in ranks around the four sides of the courtyard square, with shorter lines of guards arranged facing them, bayonets fixed to the ready, to prevent any unseemly outbreak.But there had been no outbreak, seemly or otherwise.The prisoners had waited in a chill silence in the light rain that misted the stones of the courtyard, with little sound other than the normal coughs and throat clearings of any assemblage of men.It was the beginning of winter, and catarrh was almost as common a scourge in the barracks as it was in the damp cells.He had stood watching impassively, hands folded behind his back, as the prisoner was led to the platform.Watched, feeling the rain seep into the shoulders of his coat and run in tiny rivulets down the neck of his shirt, as Jamie Fraser stood on the platform a yard away and stripped to the waist, moving without haste or hesitation, as though this were something he had done before, an accustomed task, of no importance in itself.He had nodded to the two privates, who seized the prisoners unresisting hands and raised them, binding them to the arms of the whipping post.They gagged him, and Fraser stood upright, the rain running down his raised arms, and down the deep seam of his backbone, to soak the thin cloth of his breeches.Another nod, to the sergeant who held the charge sheet, and a small surge of annoyance as the gesture caused a cascade of collected rain from one side of his hat.He straightened his hat and sodden wig, and resumed his stance of authority in time to hear the charge and sentence read.in contravention of the Diskilting Act, passed by His Majestys Parliament, for which crime the sentence of sixty lashes shall be inflicted.Grey glanced with professional detachment at the sergeant farrier designated to give the punishment; this was not the first time for any of them.He didnt nod this time; the rain was still falling.A half closing of the eyes instead, as he spoke the usual words:  Mr.Fraser, you will take your punishment.And he stood, eyes front and steady, watching, and hearing the thud of the landing flails and the grunt of the prisoners breath, forced past the gag by the blow.The mans muscles tightened in resistance to the pain.Again and again, until each separate muscle stood hard under the skin.His own muscles ached with tension, and he shifted inconspicuously from one leg to another, as the brutal tedium continued.Thin streams of red ran down the prisoners spine, blood mixed with water, staining the cloth of his breeches.Grey could feel the men behind him, soldiers and prisoners both, all eyes fixed on the platform and its central figure.Even the coughing was silenced.And over it all like a sticky coat of varnish sealing off Greys feelings was a thin layer of self disgust, as he realized that his eyes were fixed on the scene not out of duty, but from sheer inability to look away from the sheen of mingled rain and blood that gleamed on muscle, tightened in anguish to a curve of wrenching beauty.The sergeant farrier paused only briefly between blows.He was hurrying it slightly; everyone wanted to get it over and get out of the rain.Grissom counted each stroke in a loud voice, noting it on his sheet as he did so.The farrier checked the lash, running the strands with their hard waxed knots between his fingers to free them of blood and bits of flesh, then raised the cat once more, swung it slowly twice round his head, and struck again.Thirty!said the sergeant.Major Grey pulled out the lowest drawer of his desk, and was neatly sick, all over a stack of requisitions.His fingers were dug hard into his palms, but the shaking wouldnt stop.It was deep in his bones, like the winter cold.Put a blanket over him; Ill tend him in a moment.The English surgeons voice seemed to come from a long way off; he felt no connection between the voice and the hands that gripped him firmly by both arms.He cried out as they shifted him, the torsion splitting the barely clotted wounds on his back.The trickle of warm blood across his ribs made the shaking worse, despite the rough blanket they laid over his shoulders.He gripped the edges of the bench on which he lay, cheek pressed against the wood, eyes closed, struggling against the shaking.There was a stir and a shuffle somewhere in the room, but he couldnt take notice, couldnt take his attention from the clenching of his teeth and the tightness of his joints.The door closed, and the room grew quiet.Had they left him alone?No, there were footsteps near his head, and the blanket over him lifted, folded back to his waist.Mm.Made a mess of you, didnt he, boy?He didnt answer; no answer seemed expected, in any case.The surgeon turned away for a moment; then he felt a hand beneath his cheek, lifting his head.A towel slid beneath his face, cushioning it from the rough wood.Im going to cleanse the wounds now, the voice said.It was impersonal, but not unfriendly.He drew in his breath through his teeth as a hand touched his back.There was an odd whimpering noise.He realized he had made it, and was ashamed.How old are you, boy?Nineteen.He barely got the word out, before biting down hard on a moan.The doctor touched his back gently here and there, then stood up.He heard the sound of the bolt being shot to, then the doctors steps returning.No one will come in now, the voice said kindly.Go ahead and cry.Hey!the voice was saying.Wake up, man!He came slowly to consciousness; the roughness of wood beneath his cheek brought dream and waking together for a moment, and he couldnt remember where he was.A hand came out of the darkness, touching him tentatively on the cheek.Ye were greetin in your sleep, man, the voice whispered.Does it pain ye much?A bit.He realized the other link between dreaming and waking as he tried to raise himself and the pain crackled over his back like sheet lightning.He let out his breath in an involuntary grunt and dropped back on the bench.He had been lucky; he had drawn Dawes, a stout, middle aged soldier who didnt really like flogging prisoners, and did it only because it was part of his job.Still, sixty lashes did damage, even if applied without enthusiasm.Nah, then, thats too hot by half.Want to scald him, do ye?It was Morrisons voice, scolding.It would be Morrison, of course.Odd, he thought dimly.How whenever you had a group of men, they seemed to find their proper jobs, no matter whether it was a thing theyd done before.Morrison had been a cottar, like most of them.Likely a good hand with his beasts, but not thinking much about it.Now he was the natural healer for the men, the one they turned to with a griping belly or a broken thumb.Morrison knew little more than the rest, but the men turned to him when they were hurt, as they turned to Seumus Mac Dubh for reassurance and direction.And for justice.The steaming cloth was laid across his back and he grunted with the sting of it, pressing his lips tight to keep from crying out.He could feel the shape of Morrisons small hand, lightly laid in the center of his back.Bide ye, man,til the heat passes.As the nightmare faded, he blinked for a moment, adjusting himself to the nearby voices and the perception of company.He was in the large cell, in the shadowy nook by the chimney breast.Steam rose from the fire; there must be a cauldron boiling.He saw Walter MacLeod lower a fresh armful of rags into its depths, the fire touching MacLeods dark beard and brows with red.Then, as the heated rags on his back cooled to a soothing warmth, he closed his eyes and sank back into a half doze, lulled by the soft conversation of the men nearby.It was familiar, this state of dreamy detachment.He had felt much the same ever since the moment when he had reached over young Anguss shoulder and closed his fist on the scrap of tartan cloth.As though with that choice, some curtain had come down between him and the men around him; as though he were alone, in some quiet place of infinite remoteness.He had followed the guard who took him, stripped himself when told, but all without feeling as though he had truly waked.Taken his place on the platform and heard the words of crime and sentence pronounced, without really listening.Not even the rough bite of the rope on his wrists or the cold rain on his naked back had roused him.These seemed all things that had happened before; nothing he said or did could change a thing; it was all fated.As for the flogging, he had borne it.There was no room then for thought or regret, or for anything beyond the stubborn, desperate struggle such bodily insult required.Still, now, still.Morrisons hand rested on his neck, to prevent his moving as the sodden rags were taken off and a fresh, hot poultice applied, momentarily rousing all the dormant nerves to fresh startlement.One consequence of his odd state of mind was that all sensations seemed of equal intensity.He could, if he tried, feel each separate stripe across his back, see each one in his minds eye as a vivid streak of color across the dark of imagination.But the pain of the gash that ran from ribs to shoulder was of no more weight or consequence than the almost pleasant feeling of heaviness in his legs, the soreness in his arms, or the soft tickling brush of his hair across his cheek.His pulse beat slow and regular in his ears; the sigh of his breath was a thing apart from the heave of his chest as he breathed.He existed only as a collection of fragments, each small piece with its own sensations, and none of them of any particular concern to the central intelligence.Here, Mac Dubh, said Morrisons voice, next to his ear.Lift your head, and drink this.The sharp scent of whisky struck him, and he tried to turn his head away.I dont need it, he said.That ye do, Morrison said, with that firm matter of factness that all healers seemed to have, as though they always knew better than you did what you felt like or what you required.Lacking strength or will to argue, he opened his mouth and sipped the whisky, feeling his neck muscles quiver under the strain of holding his head up.The whisky added its own bit to the chorus of sensations that filled him.A burn in throat and belly, sharp tingle up the back of the nose, and a sort of whirling in his head that told him he had drunk too much, too fast.A bit more, now, aye, thats it, Morrison said, coaxing.Good lad.Aye, thatll be better, wont it?Morrisons thick body moved, so his vision of the darkened room was obscured.A draft blew from the high window, but there seemed more stir about him than was accounted for by the wind.Now, hows the back?Yell be stiff as a cornstook by the morrow, but I think its maybe no so bad as it might be.Here, man, yell have a sup more.The rim of the horn cup pressed insistently against his mouth.Morrison was still talking, rather loudly, of nothing in particular.There was something wrong about that.Morrison was not a talkative man.Something was happening, but he couldnt see.He lifted his head, searching for what was wrong, but Morrison pressed it down again.Dinna trouble yourself, Mac Dubh, he said softly.Ye canna stop it, anyway.Surreptitious sounds were coming from the far corner of the cell, the sounds Morrison had tried to keep him from hearing.Scraping noises, brief mutters, a thud.Then the muffled sound of blows, slow and regular, and a heavy gasping of fright and pain, punctuated with a small whimpering sound of indrawn breath.They were beating young Angus MacKenzie.He braced his hands beneath his chest, but the effort made his back blaze and his head swim.Morrisons hand was back, forcing him down.Be still, Mac Dubh, he said.His tone was a mixture of authority and resignation.A wave of dizziness washed through him, and his hands slipped off the bench.Morrison was right in any case, he realized.He couldnt stop them.He lay still then under Morrisons hand, eyes closed, and waited for the sounds to stop.Despite himself, he wondered who it was, that administrator of blind justice in the dark.Sinclair.His mind supplied the answer without hesitation.And Hayes and Lindsay helping, no doubt.They could no more help themselves than he could, or Morrison.Men did as they were born to.One man a healer, another a bully.The sounds had stopped, except for a muffled, sobbing gasp.His shoulders relaxed, and he didnt move as Morrison took away the last wet poultice and gently blotted him dry, the draft from the window making him shiver in sudden chill.He pressed his lips tight, to make no noise.They had gagged him this afternoon, and he was glad of it; the first time he had been flogged, years ago, he had bitten his lower lip nearly in two.The cup of whisky pressed against his mouth, but he turned his head aside, and it disappeared without comment to some place where it would find a more cordial reception.Milligan, likely, the Irishman.One man with the weakness for drink, another with a hatred of it.One man a lover of women, and another  He sighed and shifted slightly on the hard plank bed.Morrison had covered him with a blanket and gone away.He felt drained and empty, still in fragments, but with his mind quite clear, perched at some far remove from the rest of him.Morrison had taken away the candle as well; it burned at the far end of the cell, where the men sat hunched companionably together, the light making black shapes of them, one indistinguishable from another, rimmed in gold light like the pictures of faceless saints in old missals.He wondered where they came from, these gifts that shaped a mans nature.From God?Was it like the descent of the Paraclete, and the tongues of fire that came to rest on the apostles?He remembered the picture in the Bible in his mothers parlor, the apostles all crowned with fire, and looking fair daft with the shock of it, standing about like a crowd of beeswax candles, lit for a party.He smiled to himself at the memory, and closed his eyes.The candle shadows wavered red on his lids.Claire, his own Clairewho knew what had sent her to him, had thrust her into a life she had surely not been born to?And yet she had known what to do, what she was meant to be, despite that.Not everyone was so fortunate as to know their gift.There was a cautious shuffling in the darkness beside him.He opened his eyes and saw no more than a shape, but knew nonetheless who it was.How are ye, Angus?he said softly in Gaelic.The youngster knelt awkwardly by him, and took his hand.I amall right.But yousir, I meanIIm sorry  Was it experience or instinct that made him tighten his own hand in reassurance?I am all right, too, he said.Lay ye down, wee Angus, and take your rest.The shape bent its head in an oddly formal gesture, and pressed a kiss on the back of his hand.Imay I stay by ye, sir?His hand weighed a ton, but he lifted it nonetheless and laid it on the young mans head.Then it slipped away, but he felt Anguss tension relax, as the comfort flowed from his touch.He had been born a leader, then bent and shaped further to fit such a destiny.But what of a man who had not been born to the role he was required to fill?John Grey, for one.Charles Stuart for another.For the first time in ten years, from this strange distance, he could find it in himself to forgive that feeble man who had once been his friend.Having so often paid the price exacted by his own gift, he could at last see the more terrible doom of having been born a king, without the gift of kingship.Angus MacKenzie sat slumped against the wall next to him, head bowed upon his knees, his blanket over his shoulders.A small, gurgling snore came from the huddled form.He could feel sleep coming for him, fitting back the shattered, scattered parts of himself as it came, and knew he would wake wholeif very sorein the morning.He felt relieved at once of many things.Of the weight of immediate responsibility, of the necessity for decision.Temptation was gone, along with the possibility of it.More important, the burden of anger had lifted; perhaps it was gone for good.So, he thought, through the gathering fog, John Grey had given him back his destiny.Almost, he could be grateful.13  MIDGAME  Inverness   June 2, 1968  It was Roger who found her in the morning, curled up on the study sofa under the hearthrug, papers scattered carelessly over the floor where they had spilled from one of the folders.The light from the floor length windows streamed in, flooding the study, but the high back of the sofa had shaded Claires face and prevented the dawn from waking her.The light was just now pouring over the curve of dusty velvet to flicker among the strands of her hair.A glass face in more ways than one, Roger thought, looking at her.Her skin was so fair that the blue veins showed through at temple and throat, and the sharp, clear bones were so close beneath that she might have been carved of ivory.The rug had slipped half off, exposing her shoulders.One arm lay relaxed across her chest, trapping a single, crumpled sheet of paper against her body.Roger lifted her arm carefully, to pull the paper loose without waking her.She was limp with sleep, her flesh surprisingly warm and smooth in his grasp.His eyes found the name at once; he had known she must have found it.James MacKenzie Fraser, he murmured.He looked up from the paper to the sleeping woman on the sofa.The light had just touched the curve of her ear; she stirred briefly and turned her head, then her face lapsed back into somnolence.I dont know who you were, mate, he whispered to the unseen Scot, but you must have been something, to deserve her.Very gently, he replaced the rug over Claires shoulders, and lowered the blind of the window behind her.Then he squatted and gathered up the scattered papers from the Ardsmuir folder.Ardsmuir.That was all he needed for now; even if Jamie Frasers eventual fate was not recorded in the pages in his hands, it would be somewhere in the history of Ardsmuir prison.It might take another foray into the Highland archives, or even a trip to London, but the next step in the link had been forged; the path was clear.Brianna was coming down the stairs as he pulled the door of the study closed, moving with exaggerated caution.She arched a brow in question and he lifted the folder, smiling.Got him, he whispered.She didnt speak, but an answering smile spread across her face, bright as the rising sun outside.PART FOUR    The Lake District   14  GENEVA  Helwater   September 1756  I think, Grey said carefully, that you might consider changing your name.He didnt expect an answer; in four days of travel, Fraser had not spoken a single word to him, managing even the awkward business of sharing an inn room without direct communication.Grey had shrugged and taken the bed, while Fraser, without gesture or glance, had wrapped himself in his threadbare cloak and lain down before the hearth.Scratching an assortment of bites from fleas and bedbugs, Grey thought that Fraser might well have had the better end of the sleeping arrangements.Your new host is not well disposed toward Charles Stuart and his adherents, having lost his only son at Prestonpans, he went on, addressing the iron set profile visible next to him.Gordon Dunsany had been only a few years older than himself, a young captain in Boltons regiment.They might easily have died together on that fieldif not for that meeting in the wood near Carryarrick.You can scarcely hope to conceal the fact that you are a Scot, and a Highlander at that.If you will condescend to consider a piece of well meant advice, it might be judicious not to use a name which would be as easily recognized as your own.Frasers stony expression didnt alter in the slightest particular.He nudged his horse with a heel and guided it ahead of Greys bay, seeking the remains of the track, washed out by a recent flood.It was late afternoon when they crossed the arch of Ashness Bridge and started down the slope toward Watendlath Tarn.The Lake District of England was nothing like Scotland, Grey reflected, but at least there were mountains here.Round flanked, fat and dreamy mountains, not sternly forbidding like the Highland crags, but mountains nonetheless.Watendlath Tarn was dark and ruffled in the early autumn wind, its edges thick with sedge and marsh grass.The summer rains had been more generous even than usual in this damp place, and the tips of drowned shrubs poked limp and tattered above water that had run over its banks.At the crest of the next hill, the track split, going off in two directions.Fraser, some distance ahead, pulled his horse to a stop and waited for direction, the wind ruffling his hair.He had not plaited it that morning, and it blew free, the flaming strands lifting wild about his head.Squelching his way up the slope, John William Grey looked up at the man above him, still as a bronze statue on his mount, save for that rippling mane.The breath dried in his throat, and he licked his lips.O Lucifer, thou son of the morning, he murmured to himself, but forbore to add the rest of the quotation.For Jamie, the four day ride to Helwater had been torture.The sudden illusion of freedom, combined with the certainty of its immediate loss, gave him a dreadful anticipation of his unknown destination.This, with the anger and sorrow of his parting from his men fresh in memorythe wrenching loss of leaving the Highlands, with the knowledge that the parting might well be permanentand his waking moments suffused with the physical pain of long unused saddle muscles, were together enough to have kept him in torment for the whole of the journey.Only the fact that he had given his parole kept him from pulling Major John William Grey off his horse and throttling him in some peaceful lane.Greys words echoed in his ears, half obliterated by the thrumming beat of his angry blood.As the renovation of the fortress has largely been completedwith the able assistance of yourself and your menGrey had allowed a tinge of irony to show in his voicethe prisoners are to be removed to other accommodation, and the fortress of Ardsmuir garrisoned by troops of His Majestys Twelfth Dragoons.The Scottish prisoners of war are to be transported to the American Colonies, he continued.They will be sold under bond of indenture, for a term of seven years.Jamie had kept himself carefully expressionless, but at that news, had felt his face and hands go numb with shock.Indenture?That is no better than slavery, he said, but did not pay much attention to his own words.America!A land of wilderness and savagesand one to be reached across three thousand miles of empty, roiling sea!Indenture in America was a sentence tantamount to permanent exile from Scotland.A term of indenture is not slavery, Grey had assured him, but the Major knew as well as he that the difference was merely a legality, and true only insofar as indentured servants wouldif they survivedregain their freedom upon some predetermined date.An indentured servant was to most other intents and purposes the slave of his or her masterto be misused, whipped or branded at will, forbidden by law to leave the masters premises without permission.As James Fraser was now to be forbidden.You are not to be sent with the others.Grey had not looked at him while speaking.You are not merely a prisoner of war, you are a convicted traitor.As such, you are imprisoned at the pleasure of His Majesty; your sentence cannot be commuted to transportation without royal approval.And His Majesty has not seen fit to give that approval.Jamie was conscious of a remarkable array of emotions; beneath his immediate rage was fear and sorrow for the fate of his men, mingled with a small flicker of ignominious relief that, whatever his own fate was to be, it would not involve entrusting himself to the sea.Shamed by the realization, he turned a cold eye on Grey.The gold, he said flatly.Thats it, aye?So long as there remained the slightest chance of his revealing what he knew about that half mythical hoard, the English Crown would take no chance of having him lost to the sea demons or the savages of the Colonies.The Major still would not look at him, but gave a small shrug, as good as assent.Where am I to go, then?His own voice had sounded rusty to his ears, slightly hoarse as he began to recover from the shock of the news.Grey had busied himself putting away his records.It was early September, and a warm breeze blew through the half open window, fluttering the papers.Its called Helwater.In the Lake District of England.You will be quartered with Lord Dunsany, to serve in whatever menial capacity he may require.Grey did look up then, the expression in his light blue eyes unreadable.I shall visit you there once each quarterto ensure your welfare.He eyed the Majors red coated back now, as they rode single file through the narrow lanes, seeking refuge from his miseries in a satisfying vision of those wide blue eyes, bloodshot and popping in amazement as Jamies hands tightened on that slender throat, thumbs digging into the sun reddened flesh until the Majors small, muscular body should go limp as a killed rabbit in his grasp.His Majestys pleasure, was it?He was not deceived.This had been Greys doing; the gold only an excuse.He was to be sold as a servant, and kept in a place where Grey could see it, and gloat.This was the Majors revenge.He had lain before the inn hearth each night, aching in every limb, acutely aware of every twitch and rustle and breath of the man in the bed behind him, and deeply resentful of that awareness.By the pale gray of dawn, he was keyed to fury once more, longing for the man to rise from his bed and make some disgraceful gesture toward him, so that he might release his fury in the passion of murder.But Grey had only snored.Over Helvellyn Bridge and past another of the strange grassy tarns, the red and yellow leaves of maple and larch whirling down in showers past the lightly sweated quarters of his horse, striking his face and sliding past him with a papery, whispering caress.Grey had stopped just ahead, and turned in the saddle, waiting.They had arrived, then.The land sloped steeply down into a valley, where the manor house lay half concealed in a welter of autumn bright trees.Helwater lay before him, and with it, the prospect of a life of shameful servitude.He stiffened his back and kicked his horse, harder than he intended.Grey was received in the main drawing room, Lord Dunsany being cordially dismissive of his disheveled clothes and filthy boots, and Lady Dunsany, a small round woman with faded fair hair, fulsomely hospitable.A drink, Johnny, you must have a drink!And Louisa, my dear, perhaps you should fetch the girls down to greet our guest.As Lady Dunsany turned to give orders to a footman, his Lordship leaned close over the glass to murmur to him.The Scottish prisoneryouve brought him with you?Yes, Grey said.Lady Dunsany, now in animated conversation with the butler about the altered dispositions for dinner, was unlikely to overhear, but he thought it best to keep his own voice low.I left him in the front hallI wasnt sure quite what you meant to do with him.You said the fellows good with horses, eh?Best make him a groom then, as you suggested.Lord Dunsany glanced at his wife, and carefully turned so that his lean back was to her, further guarding their conversation.I havent told Louisa who he is, the baronet muttered.All that scare about the Highlanders during the Risingcountry was quite paralyzed with fear, you know?And shes never got over Gordons death.I quite see.Grey patted the old mans arm reassuringly.He didnt think Dunsany himself had got over the death of his son, though he had rallied himself gamely for the sake of his wife and daughters.Ill just tell her the mans a servant youve recommended to me.Erhes safe, of course?I meanwell, the girls Lord Dunsany cast an uneasy eye toward his wife.Quite safe, Grey assured his host.Hes an honorable man, and hes given his parole.Hell neither enter the house, nor leave the boundaries of your property, save with your express permission.Helwater covered more than six hundred acres, he knew.It was a long way from freedom, and from Scotland as well, but perhaps something better either than the narrow stones of Ardsmuir or the distant hardships of the Colonies.A sound from the doorway swung Dunsany around, restored to beaming joviality by the appearance of his two daughters.Youll remember Geneva, Johnny?he asked, urging his guest forward.Isobel was still in the nursery last time you camehow time does fly, does it not?And he shook his head in mild dismay.Isobel was fourteen, small and round and bubbly and blond, like her mother.Grey didnt, in fact, remember Genevaor rather he did, but the scrawny schoolgirl of years past bore little resemblance to the graceful seventeen year old who now offered him her hand.If Isobel resembled their mother, Geneva rather took after her father, at least in the matter of height and leanness.Lord Dunsanys grizzled hair might once have been that shining chestnut, and the girl had Dunsanys clear gray eyes.The girls greeted the visitor with politeness, but were clearly more interested in something else.Daddy, said Isobel, tugging on her fathers sleeve.Theres a huge man in the hall!He watched us all the time we were coming down the stairs!Hes scary looking!Who is he, Daddy?Geneva asked.She was more reserved than her sister, but clearly also interested.Erwhy, that must be the new groom Johns brought us, Lord Dunsany said, obviously flustered.Ill have one of the footmen take him The baronet was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a footman in the doorway.Sir, he said, looking shocked at the news he bore, there is a Scotchman in the hall!Lest this outrageous statement not be believed, he turned and gestured widely at the tall, silent figure standing cloaked behind him.At this cue, the stranger took a step forward, and spotting Lord Dunsany, politely inclined his head.My name is Alex MacKenzie, he said, in a soft Highland accent.He bowed toward Lord Dunsany, with no hint of mockery in his manner.Your servant, my lord.For one accustomed to the strenuous life of a Highland farm or a labor prison, the work of a groom on a Lake District stud farm was no great strain.For a man who had been mewed up in a cell for two monthssince the others had left for the Coloniesit was the hell of a sweat.For the first week, while his muscles reaccustomed themselves to the sudden demands of constant movement, Jamie Fraser fell into his hayloft pallet each evening too tired even to dream.He had arrived at Helwater in such a state of exhaustion and mental turmoil that he had at first seen it only as another prisonand one among strangers, far away from the Highlands.Now that he was ensconced here, imprisoned as securely by his word as by bars, he found both body and mind growing easier, as the days passed by.His body toughened, his feelings calmed in the quiet company of horses, and gradually he found it possible to think rationally again.If he had no true freedom, he did at least have air, and light, space to stretch his limbs, and the sight of mountains and the lovely horses that Dunsany bred.The other grooms and servants were understandably suspicious of him, but inclined to leave him alone, out of respect for his size and forbidding countenance.It was a lonely lifebut he had long since accepted the fact that for him, life was unlikely ever to be otherwise.The soft snows came down upon Helwater, and even Major Greys official visit at Christmasa tense, awkward occasionpassed without disturbing his growing feelings of content.Very quietly, he made such arrangements as could be managed, to communicate with Jenny and Ian in the Highlands.Aside from the infrequent letters that reached him by indirect means, which he read and then destroyed for safetys sake, his only reminder of home was the beechwood rosary he wore about his neck, concealed beneath his shirt.A dozen times a day he touched the small cross that lay over his heart, conjuring each time the face of a loved one, with a brief word of prayerfor his sister, Jenny; for Ian and the childrenhis namesake, Young Jamie, Maggie, and Katherine Mary, for the twins Michael and Janet, and for Baby Ian.For the tenants of Lallybroch, the men of Ardsmuir.And always, the first prayer at morning, the last at nightand many betweenfor Claire.Lord, that she may be safe.She and the child.As the snow passed and the year brightened into spring, Jamie Fraser was aware of only one fly in the ointment of his daily existencethe presence of the Lady Geneva Dunsany.Pretty, spoilt, and autocratic, the Lady Geneva was accustomed to get what she wanted when she wanted it, and damn the convenience of anyone standing in her way.She was a good horsewomanJamie would give her thatbut so sharp tongued and whim ridden that the grooms were given to drawing straws to determine who would have the misfortune of accompanying her on her daily ride.Of late, though, the Lady Geneva had been making her own choice of companionAlex MacKenzie.Nonsense, she said, when he pleaded first discretion, and then temporary indisposition, to avoid accompanying her into the secluded mist of the foothills above Helwater; a place she was forbidden to ride, because of the treacherous footing and dangerous fogs.Dont be silly.Nobodys going to see us.Come on!And kicking her mare brutally in the ribs, was off before he could stop her, laughing back over her shoulder at him.Her infatuation with him was sufficiently obvious as to make the other grooms grin sidelong and make low voiced remarks to each other when she entered the stable.He had a strong urge, when in her company, to boot her swiftly where it would do most good, but so far had settled for maintaining a strict silence when in her company, replying to all overtures with a mumpish grunt.He trusted that she would get tired of this taciturn treatment sooner or later, and transfer her annoying attentions to another of the grooms.Orpray Godshe would soon be married, and well away from both Helwater and him.It was a rare sunny day for the Lake Country, where the difference between the clouds and the ground is often imperceptible, in terms of damp.Still, on this May afternoon it was warm, warm enough for Jamie to have found it comfortable to remove his shirt.It was safe enough up here in the high field, with no likelihood of company beyond Bess and Blossom, the two stolid drayhorses pulling the roller.It was a big field, and the horses old and well trained to the task, which they liked; all he need do was twitch the reins occasionally, to keep their noses heading straight.The roller was made of wood, rather than the older kind of stone or metal, and constructed with a narrow slit between each board, so that the interior could be filled with well rotted manure, which dribbled out in a steady stream as the roller turned, lightening the heavy contrivance as it drained.Jamie thoroughly approved this innovation.He must tell Ian about it; draw a diagram.The gypsies would be coming soon; the kitchenmaids and grooms were all talking of it.He would maybe have time to add another installment to the ongoing letter he kept, sending the current crop of pages whenever a band of roving tinkers or gypsies came onto the farm.Delivery might be delayed for a month, or three, or six, but eventually the packet would make its way into the Highlands, passed from hand to hand, and on to his sister at Lallybroch, who would pay a generous fee for its reception.Replies from Lallybroch came by the same anonymous routefor as a prisoner of the Crown, anything he sent or received by the mails must be inspected by Lord Dunsany.He felt a moments excitement at the thought of a letter, but tried to damp it down; there might be nothing.Gee!he shouted, more as a matter of form than anything.Bess and Blossom could see the approaching stone fence as well as he could, and were perfectly well aware that this was the spot to begin the ponderous turnabout.Bess waggled one ear and snorted, and he grinned.Aye, I know, he said to her, with a light twitch of the rein.But they pay me to say it.Then they were settled in the new track, and there was nothing more to do until they reached the wagon standing at the foot of the field, piled high with manure for refilling the roller.The sun was on his face now, and he closed his eyes, reveling in the feel of warmth on his bare chest and shoulders.The sound of a horses high whinny stirred him from somnolence a quarter hour later.Opening his eyes, he could see the rider coming up the lane from the lower paddock, neatly framed between Blossoms ears.Hastily, he sat up and pulled the shirt back over his head.You neednt be modest on my account, MacKenzie.Geneva Dunsanys voice was high and slightly breathless as she pulled her mare to a walk beside the moving roller.Mmphm.She was dressed in her best habit, he saw, with a cairngorm brooch at her throat, and her color was higher than the temperature of the day warranted.What are you doing?she asked, after they had rolled and paced in silence for some moments.I am spreading shit, my lady, he answered precisely, not looking at her.Oh.She rode on for the space of half a track, before venturing further into conversation.Did you know I am to be married?He did; all the servants had known it for a month, Richards the butler having been in the library, serving, when the solicitor came from Derwentwater to draw up the wedding contract.The Lady Geneva had been informed two days ago.According to her maid, Betty, the news had not been well received.He contented himself with a noncommittal grunt.To Ellesmere, she said.The color rose higher in her cheeks, and her lips pressed together.I wish ye every happiness, my lady.Jamie pulled briefly on the reins as they came to the end of the field.He was out of the seat before Bess had set her hooves; he had no wish at all to linger in conversation with the Lady Geneva, whose mood seemed thoroughly dangerous.Happiness!she cried.Her big gray eyes flashed and she slapped the thigh of her habit.Happiness!Married to a man old enough to be my own grandsire?Jamie refrained from saying that he suspected the Earl of Ellesmeres prospects for happiness were somewhat more limited than her own.Instead, he murmured, Your pardon, my lady, and went behind to unfasten the roller.She dismounted and followed him.Its a filthy bargain between my father and Ellesmere!Hes selling me, thats what it is.My father cares not the slightest trifle for me, or hed never have made such a match!Do you not think I am badly used?On the contrary, Jamie thought that Lord Dunsany, a most devoted father, had probably made the best match possible for his spoilt elder daughter.The Earl of Ellesmere was an old man.There was every prospect that within a few years, Geneva would be left as an extremely wealthy young widow, and a countess, to boot.On the other hand, such considerations might well not weigh heavily with a headstrong missa stubborn, spoilt bitch, he corrected, seeing the petulant set of her mouth and eyesof seventeen.I am sure your father acts always in your best interests, my lady, he answered woodenly.Would the little fiend not go away?She wouldnt.Assuming a more winsome expression, she came and stood close to his side, interfering with his opening the loading hatch of the roller.But a match with such a dried up old man?she said.Surely it is heartless of Father to give me to such a creature.She stood on tiptoe, peering at Jamie.How old are you, MacKenzie?His heart stopped beating for an instant.A verra great deal older than you, my lady, he said firmly.Your pardon, my lady.He slid past her as well as he might without touching her, and leaped up onto the manure wagon, whence he was reasonably sure she wouldnt follow him.But not ready for the boneyard yet, are you, MacKenzie?Now she was in front of him, shading her eyes with her hand as she peered upward.A breeze had come up, and wisps of her chestnut hair floated about her face.Have you ever been married, MacKenzie?He gritted his teeth, overcome with the urge to drop a shovelful of manure over her chestnut head, but mastered it and dug the shovel into the pile, merely saying I have, in a tone that brooked no further inquiries.The Lady Geneva was not interested in other peoples sensitivities.Good, she said, satisfied.Youll know what to do, then.To do?He stopped short in the act of digging, one foot braced on the shovel.In bed, she said calmly.I want you to come to bed with me.In the shock of the moment, all he could think of was the ludicrous vision of the elegant Lady Geneva, skirts thrown up over her face, asprawl in the rich crumble of the manure wagon.He dropped the shovel.Here?he croaked.No, silly, she said impatiently.In bed, in a proper bed.In my bedroom.You have lost your mind, Jamie said coldly, the shock receding slightly.Or I should think you had, if ye had one to lose.Her face flamed and her eyes narrowed.How dare you speak that way to me!How dare ye speak so to me?Jamie replied hotly.A wee lassie of breeding to be makin indecent proposals to a man twice her age?And a groom in her fathers house?he added, recollecting who he was.He choked back further remarks, recollecting also that this dreadful girl was the Lady Geneva, and he was her fathers groom.I beg your pardon, my lady, he said, mastering his choler with some effort.The sun is verra hot today, and no doubt it has addled your wits a bit.I expect ye should go back to the house at once and ask your maid to put cold cloths on your head.The Lady Geneva stamped her morocco booted foot.My wits are not addled in the slightest!She glared up at him, chin set.Her chin was little and pointed, so were her teeth, and with that particular expression of determination on her face, he thought she looked a great deal like the bloody minded vixen she was.Listen to me, she said.I cannot prevent this abominable marriage.But I amshe hesitated, then continued firmlyI am damned if I will suffer my maidenhood to be given to a disgusting, depraved old monster like Ellesmere!Jamie rubbed a hand across his mouth.Despite himself, he felt some sympathy for her.But he would be damned if he allowed this skirted maniac to involve him in her troubles.I am fully sensible of the honor, my lady, he said at last, with a heavy irony, but I really cannot  Yes, you can.Her eyes rested frankly on the front of his filthy breeches.Betty says so.He struggled for speech, emerging at first with little more than incoherent sputterings.Finally he drew a deep breath and said, with all the firmness he could muster, Betty has not the slightest basis for drawing conclusions as to my capacity.I havena laid a hand on the lass!Geneva laughed delightedly.So you didnt take her to bed?She said you wouldnt, but I thought perhaps she was only trying to avoid a beating.Thats good; I couldnt possibly share a man with my maid.He breathed heavily.Smashing her on the head with the shovel or throttling her were unfortunately out of the question.His inflamed temper slowly calmed.Outrageous she might be, but essentially powerless.She could scarcely force him to go to her bed.Good day to ye, my lady, he said, as politely as possible.He turned his back on her and began to shovel manure into the hollow roller.If you dont, she said sweetly, Ill tell my father you made improper advances to me.Hell have the skin flayed off your back.His shoulders hunched involuntarily.She couldnt possibly know.He had been careful never to take his shirt off in front of anyone since he came here.He turned carefully and stared down at her.The light of triumph was in her eye.Your father may not be so well acquent with me, he said, but hes kent you since ye were born.Tell him, and be damned to ye!She puffed up like a game cock, her face growing bright red with temper.Is that so?she cried.Well, look at this, then, and be damned to you!She reached into the bosom of her habit and pulled out a thick letter, which she waved under his nose.His sisters firm black hand was so familiar that a glimpse was enough.Give me that!He was down off the wagon and after her in a flash, but she was too fast.She was up in the saddle before he could grab her, backing with the reins in one hand, waving the letter mockingly in the other.Want it, do you?Yes, I want it!Give it to me!He was so furious, he could easily have done her violence, could he get his hands on her.Unfortunately, her bay mare sensed his mood, and backed away, snorting and pawing uneasily.I dont think so.She eyed him coquettishly, the red of ill temper fading from her face.After all, its really my duty to give this to my father, isnt it?He ought really to know that his servants are carrying on clandestine correspondences, shouldnt he?Is Jenny your sweetheart?Youve read my letter?Ye filthy wee bitch!Such language, she said, wagging the letter reprovingly.Its my duty to help my parents, by letting them know what sorts of dreadful things the servants are up to, isnt it?And I am a dutiful daughter, am I not, submitting to this marriage without a squeak?She leaned forward on her pommel, smiling mockingly, and with a fresh spurt of rage, he realized that she was enjoying this very much indeed.I expect Papa will find it very interesting reading, she said.Especially the bit about the gold to be sent to Lochiel in France.Isnt it still considered treason to be giving comfort to the Kings enemies?Tsk, she said, clicking her tongue roguishly.How wicked.He thought he might be sick on the spot, from sheer terror.Did she have the faintest idea how many lives lay in that manicured white hand?His sister, Ian, their six children, all the tenants and families of Lallybrochperhaps even the lives of the agents who carried messages and money between Scotland and France, maintaining the precarious existence of the Jacobite exiles there.He swallowed, once, and then again, before he spoke.All right, he said.A more natural smile broke out on her face, and he realized how very young she was.Aye, well, and a wee adders bite was as venomous as an auld ones.I wont tell, she assured him, looking earnest.Ill give you your letter back afterward, and I wont ever say what was in it.I promise.Thank you.He tried to gather his wits enough to make a sensible plan.Sensible?Going into his masters house to ravish his daughters maidenhoodat her request?He had never heard of a less sensible prospect.All right, he said again.We must be careful.With a feeling of dull horror, he felt himself being drawn into the role of conspirator with her.Yes.Dont worry, I can arrange for my maid to be sent away, and the footman drinks; hes always asleep before ten oclock.Arrange it, then, he said, his stomach curdling.Mind ye choose a safe day, though.A safe day?She looked blank.Sometime in the week after yeve finished your courses, he said bluntly.Youre less likely to get wi child then.Oh.She blushed rosily at that, but looked at him with a new interest.They looked at each other in silence for a long moment, suddenly linked by the prospect of the future.Ill send you word, she said at last, and wheeling her horse about, galloped away across the field, the mares hooves kicking up spurts of the freshly spread manure.Cursing fluently and silently, he crept beneath the row of larches.There wasnt much moon, which was a blessing.Six yards of open lawn to cross in a dash, and he was knee deep in the columbine and germander of the flowerbed.He looked up the side of the house, its bulk looming dark and forbidding above him.Yes, there was the candle in the window, as shed said.Still, he counted the windows carefully, to verify it.Heaven help him if he chose the wrong room.Heaven help him if it was the right one, too, he thought grimly, and took a firm hold on the trunk of the huge gray creeper that covered this side of the house.The leaves rustled like a hurricane and the stems, stout as they were, creaked and bent alarmingly under his weight.There was nothing for it but to climb as swiftly as possible, and be ready to hurl himself off into the night if any of the windows should suddenly be raised.He arrived at the small balcony panting, heart racing, and drenched in sweat, despite the chilliness of the night.He paused a moment, alone beneath the faint spring stars, to draw breath.He used it to damn Geneva Dunsany once more, and then pushed open her door.She had been waiting, and had plainly heard his approach up the ivy.She rose from the chaise where she had been sitting and came toward him, chin up, chestnut hair loose over her shoulders.She was wearing a white nightgown of some sheer material, tied at the throat with a silk bow.The garment didnt look like the nightwear of a modest young lady, and he realized with a shock that she was wearing her bridal night apparel.So you came.He heard the note of triumph in her voice, but also the faint quaver.So she hadnt been sure of him?I hadnt much choice, he said shortly, and turned to close the French doors behind him.Will you have some wine?Striving for graciousness, she moved to the table, where a decanter stood with two glasses.How had she managed that?he wondered.Still, a glass of something wouldnt come amiss in the present circumstances.He nodded, and took the full glass from her hand.He looked at her covertly as he sipped it.The nightdress did little to conceal her body, and as his heart gradually slowed from the panic of his ascent, he found his first fearthat he wouldnt be able to keep his half of the bargainallayed without conscious effort.She was built narrowly, slim hipped and small breasted, but most definitely a woman.Finished, he set down the glass.No point in delay, he thought.The letter?he said abruptly.Afterward, she said, tightening her mouth.Now, or I leave.And he turned toward the window, as though about to execute the threat.Wait!He turned back, but eyed her with ill disguised impatience.Dont you trust me?she said, trying to sound winsome and charming.No, he said bluntly.She looked angry at that, and thrust out a petulant lower lip, but he merely looked stonily over his shoulder at her, still facing the window.Oh, all right then, she said at last, with a shrug.Digging under the layers of embroidery in a sewing box, she unearthed the letter and tossed it onto the washing stand beside him.He snatched it up and unfolded the sheets, to be sure of it.He felt a surge of mingled fury and relief at the sight of the violated seal, and Jennys familiar hand within, neat and strong.Well?Genevas voice broke in upon his reading, impatient.Put that down and come here, Jamie.Im ready.She sat on the bed, arms curled around her knees.He stiffened, and turned a very cold blue look on her, over the pages in his hands.Youll not use that name to me, he said.She lifted the pointed chin a trifle more and raised her plucked brows.Why not?Its yours.Your sister calls you so.He hesitated for a moment, then deliberately laid the letter aside, and bent his head to the laces of his breeches.Ill serve ye properly, he said, looking down at his working fingers, for the sake of my own honor as a man, and yours as a woman.Buthe raised his head and the narrowed blue eyes bored into hershaving brought me to your bed by means of threats against my family, Ill not have ye call me by the name they give me.He stood motionless, eyes fixed on hers.At last she gave a very small nod, and her eyes dropped to the quilt.She traced the pattern with a finger.What must I call you, then?she asked at last, in a small voice.I cant call you MacKenzie!The corners of his mouth lifted slightly as he looked at her.She looked quite small, huddled into herself with her arms locked around her knees and her head bowed.He sighed.Call me Alex, then.Its my own name, as well.She nodded without speaking.Her hair fell forward in wings about her face, but he could see the brief shine of her eyes as she peeped out from behind its cover.Its all right, he said gruffly.You can watch me.He pushed the loose breeches down, rolling the stockings off with them.He shook them out and folded them neatly over a chair before beginning to unfasten his shirt, conscious of her gaze, still shy, but now direct.Out of some idea of thoughtfulness, he turned to face her before removing the shirt, to spare her for a moment the sight of his back.Oh!The exclamation was soft, but enough to stop him.Is something wrong?he asked.Oh, noI mean, its only that I didnt expect The hair swung forward again, but not before he had seen the telltale reddening of her cheeks.Youve not seen a man naked before?he guessed.The shiny brown head swayed back and forth.Noo, she said doubtfully, I have, onlyit wasnt  Well, it usually isnt, he said matter of factly, sitting down on the bed beside her.But if one is going to make love, it has to be, ye see.I see, she said, but still sounded doubtful.He tried to smile, to reassure her.Dont worry.It doesna get any bigger.And it wilna do anything strange, if ye want to touch it.At least he hoped it wouldnt.Being naked, in such close proximity to a half clad girl, was doing terrible things to his powers of self control.His traitorous, deprived anatomy didnt care a whit that she was a selfish, blackmailing little bitch.Perhaps fortunately, she declined his offer, shrinking back a little toward the wall, though her eyes stayed on him.He rubbed his chin dubiously.How much do youI mean, have ye any idea how its done?Her gaze was clear and guileless, though her cheeks flamed.Well, like the horses, I suppose?He nodded, but felt a pang, recalling his wedding night, when he too had expected it to be like horses.Something like that, he said, clearing his throat.Slower, though.More gentle, he added, seeing her apprehensive look.Oh.Thats good.Nurse and the maids used to tell stories, aboutmen, and, er, getting married, and allit sounded rather frightening.She swallowed hard.W will it hurt much?She raised her head suddenly and looked him in the eye.I dont mind if it does, she said bravely, its only that Id like to know what to expect.He felt an unexpected small liking for her.She might be spoiled, selfish, and reckless, but there was some character to her, at least.Courage, to him, was no small virtue.I think not, he said.If I take my time to ready you (if he could take his time, amended his brain), I think it will be not much worse than a pinch.He reached out and nipped a fold of skin on her upper arm.She jumped and rubbed the spot, but smiled.I can stand that.Its only the first time its like that, he assured her.The next time it will be better.She nodded, then after a moments hesitation, edged toward him, reaching out a tentative finger.May I touch you?This time he really did laugh, though he choked the sound off quickly.I think youll have to, my lady, if Im to do what you asked of me.She ran her hand slowly down his arm, so softly that the touch tickled, and his skin shivered in response.Gaining confidence, she let her hand circle his forearm, feeling the girth of it.Youre quitebig.He smiled, but stayed motionless, letting her explore his body, at as much length as she might wish.He felt the muscles of his belly tighten as she stroked the length of one thigh, and ventured tentatively around the curve of one buttock.Her fingers approached the twisting, knotted line of the scar that ran the length of his left thigh, but stopped short.Its all right, he assured her.It doesna hurt me anymore.She didnt reply, but drew two fingers slowly along the length of the scar, exerting no pressure.The questing hands, growing bolder, slid up over the rounded curves of his broad shoulders, slid down his backand stopped dead.He closed his eyes and waited, following her movements by the shifting of weight on the mattress.She moved behind him, and was silent.Then there was a quivering sigh, and the hands touched him again, soft on his ruined back.And you werent afraid, when I said Id have you flogged?Her voice was queerly hoarse, but he kept still, eyes closed.No, he said.I am not much afraid of things, anymore.In fact, he was beginning to be afraid that he wouldnt be able to keep his hands off her, or to handle her with the necessary gentleness, when the time came.His balls ached with need, and he could feel his heartbeat, pounding in his temples.She got off the bed, and stood in front of him.He rose suddenly, startling her so that she stepped back a pace, but he reached out and rested his hands on her shoulders.May I touch you, my lady?The words were teasing, but the touch was not.She nodded, too breathless to speak, and his arms came around her.He held her against his chest, not moving until her breathing slowed.He was conscious of an extraordinary mixture of feelings.He had never in his life taken a woman in his arms without some feeling of love, but there was nothing of love in this encounter, nor could there be, for her own sake.There was some tenderness for her youth, and pity at her situation.Rage at her manipulation of him, and fear at the magnitude of the crime he was about to commit.But overall there was a terrible lust, a need that clawed at his vitals and made him ashamed of his own manhood, even as he acknowledged its power.Hating himself, he lowered his head and cupped her face between his hands.He kissed her softly, briefly, then a bit longer.She was trembling against him as his hands undid the tie of her gown and slid it back off her shoulders.He lifted her and laid her on the bed.He lay beside her, cradling her in one arm as the other hand caressed her breasts, one and then the other, cupping each so she felt the weight and the warmth of them, even as he did.A man should pay tribute to your body, he said softly, raising each nipple with small, circling touches.For you are beautiful, and that is your right.She let out her breath in a small gasp, then relaxed under his touch.He took his time, moving as slowly as he could make himself do it, stroking and kissing, touching her lightly all over.He didnt like the girl, didnt want to be here, didnt want to be doing this, butit had been more than three years since hed touched a womans body.He tried to gauge when she might be readiest, but how in hell could he tell?She was flushed and panting, but she simply lay there, like a piece of porcelain on display.Curse the girl, could she not even give him a clue?He rubbed a trembling hand through his hair, trying to quell the surge of confused emotion that pulsed through him with each heartbeat.He was angry, scared, and most mightily roused, most of which feelings were of no great use to him now.He closed his eyes and breathed deeply, striving for calm, seeking for gentleness.No, of course she couldnt show him.Shed never touched a man before.Having forced him here, she was, with a damnable, unwanted, unwarrantable trust, leaving the conduct of the whole affair up to him!He touched the girl, gently, stroking her between the thighs.She didnt part them for him, but didnt resist.She was faintly moist there.Perhaps it would be all right now?All right, he murmured to her.Be still, mo chridhe.Murmuring what he hoped sounded like reassurances, he eased himself on top of her, and used his knee to spread her legs.He felt her slight start at the heat of his body covering her, at the touch of his cock, and he wrapped his hands in her hair to steady her, still muttering things in soft Gaelic.He thought dimly that it was a good thing he was speaking Gaelic, as he was no longer paying any attention at all to what he was saying.Her small, hard breasts poked against his chest.Mo nighean, he murmured.Wait a minute, said Geneva.I think perhaps  The effort of control made him dizzy, but he did it slowly, only easing himself the barest inch within.Ooh!said Geneva.Her eyes flew wide.Uh, he said, and pushed a bit farther.Stop it!Its too big!Take it out!Panicked, Geneva thrashed beneath him.Pressed beneath his chest, her breasts wobbled and rubbed, so that his own nipples leapt erect in pinpoints of abrupt sensation.Her struggles were accomplishing by force what he had tried to do with gentleness.Half dazed, he fought to keep her under him, while groping madly for something to say to calm her.But he said.Stop it!I  Take it out!she screamed.He clapped one hand over her mouth and said the only coherent thing he could think of.No, he said definitely, and shoved.What might have been a scream emerged through his fingers as a strangled Eep!Genevas eyes were huge and round, but dry.In for a penny, in for a pound.The saying drifted absurdly through his head, leaving nothing in its wake but a jumble of incoherent alarms and a marked feeling of terrible urgency down beween them.There was precisely one thing he was capable of doing at this point, and he did it, his body ruthlessly usurping control as it moved into the rhythm of its inexorable pagan joy.It took no more than a few thrusts before the wave came down upon him, churning down the length of his spine and erupting like a breaker striking rocks, sweeping away the last shreds of conscious thought that clung, barnacle like, to the remnants of his mind.He came to himself a moment later, lying on his side with the sound of his own heartbeat loud and slow in his ears.He cracked one eyelid, and saw the shimmer of pink skin in lamplight.He must see if hed hurt her much, but God, not just this minute.He shut his eye again and merely breathed.Whatwhat are you thinking?The voice sounded hesitant, and a little shaken, but not hysterical.Too shaken himself to notice the absurdity of the question, he answered it with the truth.I was wondering why in Gods name men want to bed virgins.There was a long moment of silence, and then a tremulous intake of breath.Im sorry, she said in a small voice.I didnt know it would hurt you too.His eyes popped open in astonishment, and he raised himself on one elbow to find her looking at him like a startled fawn.Her face was pale, and she licked dry lips.Hurt me?he said, in blank astonishment.It didna hurt me.Butshe frowned as her eyes traveled slowly down the length of his bodyI thought it must.You made the most terrible face, as though it hurt awfully, and youyou groaned like a  Aye, well, he interrupted hastily, before she could reveal any more unflattering observations of his behavior.I didna meanI meanthats just how men act, when theydo that, he ended lamely.Her shock was fading into curiosity.Do all men act like that when theyredoing that?How should I?he began irritably, then stopped himself with a shudder, realizing that he did in fact know the answer to that.Aye, they do, he said shortly.He pushed himself up to a sitting position, and brushed the hair back from his forehead.Men are disgusting horrible beasts, just as your nurse told you.Have I hurt ye badly?I dont think so, she said doubtfully.She moved her legs experimentally.It did hurt, just for a moment, like you said it would, but it isnt so bad now.He breathed a sigh of relief as he saw that while she had bled, the stain on the towel was slight, and she seemed not to be in pain.She reached tentatively between her thighs and made a face of disgust.Ooh!she said.Its all nasty and sticky!The blood rose to his face in mingled outrage and embarrassment.Here, he muttered, and reached for a washcloth from the stand.She didnt take it, but opened her legs and arched her back slightly, obviously expecting him to attend to the mess.He had a strong urge to stuff the rag down her throat instead, but a glance at the stand where his letter lay stopped him.It was a bargain, after all, and shed kept her part.Grimly, he wet the cloth and began to sponge her, but he found the trust with which she presented herself to him oddly moving.He carried out his ministrations quite gently, and found himself, at the end, planting a light kiss on the smooth slope of her belly.There.Thank you, she said.She moved her hips tentatively, and reached out a hand to touch him.He didnt move, letting her fingers trail down his chest and toy with the deep indentation of his navel.The light touch hesitantly descended.You saidit would be better next time, she whispered.He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.It was a long time until the dawn.I expect it will, he said, and stretched himself once more beside her.Jaer, Alex?He felt as though he had been drugged, and it was an effort to answer her.My lady?Her arms came around his neck and she nestled her head in the curve of his shoulder, breath warm against his chest.I love you, Alex.With difficulty, he roused himself enough to put her away from him, holding her by the shoulders and looking down into the gray eyes, soft as a does.No, he said, but gently, shaking his head.Thats the third rule.You may have no more than the one night.You may not call me by my first name.And you may not love me.The gray eyes moistened a bit.But if I cant help it?It isna love you feel now.He hoped he was right, for his sake as well as her own.Its only the feeling Ive roused in your body.Its strong, and its good, but it isna the same thing as love.Whats the difference?He rubbed his hands hard over his face.She would be a philosopher, he thought wryly.He took a deep breath and blew it out before answering her.Well, loves for only one person.This, what you feel from meye can have that with any man, its not particular.Only one person.He pushed the thought of Claire firmly away, and wearily bent again to his work.He landed heavily in the earth of the flowerbed, not caring that he crushed several small and tender plants.He shivered.This hour before dawn was not only the darkest, but the coldest, as well, and his body strongly protested being required to rise from a warm, soft nest and venture into the chilly blackness, shielded from the icy air by no more than a thin shirt and breeks.He remembered the heated, rosy curve of the cheek he had bent to kiss before leaving.The shapes of her lingered, warm in his hands, curving his fingers in memory, even as he groped in the dark for the darker line of the stableyards stone wall.Drained as he was, it was a dreadful effort to haul himself up and climb over, but he couldnt risk the creak of the gate awakening Hughes, the head groom.He felt his way across the inner yard, crowded with wagons and packed bales, ready for the journey of the Lady Geneva to the home of her new lord, following the wedding on Thursday next.At last he pushed open the stable door and found his way up the ladder to his loft.He lay down in the icy straw and pulled the single blanket over him, feeling empty of everything.15  BY MISADVENTURE  Helwater   January 1758  Appropriately enough, the weather was dark and stormy when the news reached Helwater.The afternoon exercise had been canceled, owing to the heavy downpour, and the horses were snug in their stalls below.The homely, peaceful sounds of munching and blowing rose up to the loft above, where Jamie Fraser reclined in a comfortable, haylined nest, an open book propped on his chest.It was one of several he had borrowed from the estates factor, Mr.Grieves, and he was finding it absorbing, despite the difficulty of reading by the poor light from the owl slits beneath the eaves.My lips, which I threw in his way, so as that he could not escape kissing them, fixd, fird and emboldend him: and now, glancing my eyes towards that part of his dress which coverd the essential object of enjoyment, I plainly discoverd the swell and commotion there; and as I was now too far advancd to stop in so fair a way, and was indeed no longer able to contain myself, or wait the slower progress of his maiden bashfulness, I stole my hand upon his thighs, down one of which I could both see and feel a stiff hard body, confind by his breeches, that my fingers could discover no end to.Oh, aye?Jamie muttered skeptically.He raised his eyebrows and shifted himself on the hay.He had been aware that books like this existed, of course, butwith Jenny ordering the reading matter at Lallybrochhad not encountered one personally before.The type of mental engagement demanded was somewhat different from that required for the works of Messieurs Defoe and Fielding, but he was not averse to variety.Its prodigious size made me shrink again; yet I could not, without pleasure, behold, and even venturd to feel, such a length, such a breadth of animated ivory!perfectly well turnd and fashiond, the proud stiffness of which distended its skin, whose smooth polish and velvet softness might vie with that of the most delicate of our sex, and whose exquisite whiteness was not a little set off by a sprout of black curling hair round the root; then the broad and blueish casted incarnate of the head, and blue serpentines of its veins, altogether composd the most striking assemblage of figures and colors in nature.In short, it stood an object of terror and delight!Jamie glanced at his own crotch and snorted briefly at this, but flipped the page, the crash of thunder outside meriting no more than a twinge of his attention.He was so absorbed that at first he failed to hear the noises down below, the sound of voices drowned in the heavy rush and beat of the rain on the planks a few feet above his head.MacKenzie!The repeated stentorian bellow finally penetrated his awareness, and he rolled hastily to his feet, quickly straightening his clothes as he went toward the ladder.Aye?He thrust his head over the edge of the loft to see Hughes, just opening his mouth for another bellow.Oh, there ee are.Hughes shut his mouth, and beckoned with one gnarled hand, wincing as he did so.Hughes suffered mightily from rheumatics in damp weather; he had been riding out the storm snug in the small chamber beside the tack room, where he kept a bed and a jug of crudely distilled spirits.The aroma was perceptible from the loft, and grew substantially stronger as Jamie descended the ladder.Youre to help ready the coach to drive Lord Dunsany and Lady Isobel to Ellesmere, Hughes told him, the moment his foot touched the flags of the stable floor.The old man swayed alarmingly, hiccuping softly to himself.Now?Are ye daft, man?Or just drunk?He glanced at the open half door behind Hughes, which seemed a solid sheet of streaming water.Even as he looked, the sky beyond lit up with a sudden flare of lightning that threw the mountain beyond into sudden sharp relief.Just as suddenly, it disappeared, leaving its afterimage printed on his retina.He shook his head to clear the image, and saw Jeffries, the coachman, making his way across the yard, head bowed against the force of wind and water, cloak clutched tight about him.So it wasnt only a drunken fancy of Hughess.Jeffries needs help wi the horses!Hughes was forced to lean close and shout to be heard over the noise of the storm.The smell of rough alcohol was staggering at close distance.Aye, but why?Why must Lord Dunsanyah, feckit!The head grooms eyes were red rimmed and bleary; clearly there was no sense to be got out of him.Disgusted, Jamie pushed past the man and mounted the ladder two rungs at a time.A moment to wrap his own worn cloak about him, a moment more to thrust the book he had been reading under the haystable lads were no respecters of propertyand he was slithering down the ladder again, and out into the roar of the storm.It was a hellish journey.The wind screamed through the pass, striking the bulky coach and threatening to overturn it at any moment.Perched aloft beside Jeffries, a cloak was little protection against the driving rain; still less was it a help when he was forced to dismountas he did every few minutes, it seemedand put his shoulder to the wheel to free the miserable contrivance from the clinging grip of a mudhole.Still, he scarcely noticed the physical inconvenience of the journey, preoccupied as he was with the possible reasons for it.There couldnt be many matters of such urgency as to force an old man like Lord Dunsany outside on a day like this, let alone over the rutted road to Ellesmere.Some word had come from Ellesmere, and it could only concern the Lady Geneva or her child.Hearing through the servants gossip that Lady Geneva was due to be delivered in January, he had counted quickly backward, cursed Geneva Dunsany once more, and then said a hasty prayer for her safe delivery.Since then, he had done his best not to think about it.He had been with her only three days before her wedding; he couldnt be sure.A week before, Lady Dunsany had gone to Ellesmere to be with her daughter.Since then, she had sent daily messengers home, to fetch the dozen things she had forgotten to take and must have at once, and each of them, upon arrival at Helwater, had reported No news yet.Now there was news, and it was plainly bad.Passing back toward the front of the coach, after the latest battle with the mud, he saw the Lady Isobels face peering out from beneath the isinglass sheet that covered the window.Oh, MacKenzie!she said, her face contorted in fear and distress.Please, is it much farther?He leaned close to shout in her ear, over the gurgle and rush of the gullies running down both sides of the road.Jeffries says its four mile yet, milady!Two hours, maybe.If the damned and hell bent coach didnt tip itself and its hapless passengers off the Ashness Bridge into Watendlath Tarn, he added silently to himself.Isobel nodded her thanks, and lowered the window, but not before he had seen that the wetness upon her cheeks was due as much to tears as to the rain.The snake of anxiety wrapped round his heart slithered lower, to twist in his guts.It was closer to three hours by the time the coach rolled at last into the courtyard at Ellesmere.Without hesitation, Lord Dunsany leapt down and, scarcely pausing to give his younger daughter an arm, hurried into the house.It took nearly another hour to unharness the team, rub down the horses, wash the caked on mud from the coachs wheels, and put everything away in Ellesmeres stables.Numb with cold, fatigue, and hunger, he and Jeffries sought refuge and sustenance in Ellesmeres kitchens.Poor fellows, youre gone right blue wi the cold, the cook observed.Sit ye down ere, and Ill soon ave yer a hot bite.A sharp faced, spare framed woman, her figure belied her skill, for within minutes, a huge, savoury omelet was laid before them, garnished with liberal amounts of bread and butter, and a small pot of jam.Fair, quite fair, Jeffries pronounced, casting an appreciative eye on the spread.He winked at the cook.Not as it wouldn go down easier wi a drop o something to pave the way, eh?You look the sort would have mercy on a pair o poor half frozen chaps, wouldnt ye, darlin?Whether it was this piece of Irish persuasion or the sight of their dripping, steaming clothes, the argument had its effect, and a bottle of cooking brandy made its appearance next to the peppermill.Jeffries poured a large tot and drank it off without hesitation, smacking his lips.Ah, thats more like!Here, boyo.He passed the bottle to Jamie, then settled himself comfortably to a hot meal and gossip with the female servants.Well, then, whats to do here?Is the babe born yet?Oh, yes, last night!the kitchen maid said eagerly.We were up all night, with the doctor comin, and fresh sheets and towels called for, and the house all topsle turvy.But the babes the least of it!Now, then, the cook broke in, frowning censoriously.Theres too much work to be standin about gossiping.Get yer on, Mary Ann up to the study, and see if his Lordshipll be wantin anything else served now.Jamie, wiping his plate with a slice of bread, observed that the maid, far from being abashed at this rebuke, departed with alacrity, causing him to deduce that something of considerable interest was likely transpiring in the study.The undivided attention of her audience thus obtained, the cook allowed herself to be persuaded into imparting the gossip with no more than a token demur.Well, it started some months ago, when the Lady Geneva started to show, poor thing.His Lordshipd been nicer than pie to er, ever since they was married couldnt do enough for er, anything she wanted ordered from Lunnon, always askin was she warm enough,ad she what she wanted to eatfair dotin, is Lordship was.But then, when e found she was with child!The cook paused, to screw up her face portentously.Jamie wanted desperately to know about the child; what was it, and how did it fare?There seemed no way to hurry the woman, though, so he composed his face to look as interested as possible, leaning forward encouragingly.Why, the shouting, and the carryings on!the cook said, throwing up her hands in dismayed illustration, im shoutin, and er cryin, and the both of em stampin up and down and slammin doors, and im callin er names as isnt fit to be used in a stableyardand so I told Mary Ann, when she told me.Was his lordship not pleased about the child, then?Jamie interrupted.The omelet was settling into a hard lump somewhere under his breastbone.He took another gulp of brandy, in hopes of dislodging it.The cook turned a bright, birdlike eye on him, eyebrow cocked in appreciation at his intelligence.Well, youd think as e would be, wouldnt yer?But no indeed!Far from it, she added with emphasis.Why not?said Jeffries, only mildly interested.E said, the cook said, dropping her voice in awe at the scandalousness of the information, as the child wasnt is!Jeffries, well along with his second glass, snorted in contemptuous amusement.Old goat with a young gel?I should think it like enough, but how on earth would his Lordship know for sure whose the spawn was?Could be his as much as anyones, couldnt it, with only her ladyships word to go by, eh?The cooks thin mouth stretched in a bright, malicious smile.Oh, I dont say as ed know whose it was, nowbut theres one sure way ed know it wasnt is, now isnt there?Jeffries stared at the cook, tilting back on his chair.What?he said.You mean to tell me his Lordships incapable?A broad grin at this juicy thought split his weatherbeaten face.Jamie felt the omelet rising, and hastily gulped more brandy.Well, I couldnt say, Im sure.The cooks mouth assumed a prim line, then split asunder to add, though the chambermaid did say as the sheets she took off the weddin bed was as white as when theyd gone on, to be sure.It was too much.Interrupting Jeffriess delighted cackle, Jamie set down his glass with a thump, and bluntly said, Did the child live?The cook and Jeffries both stared in astonishment, but the cook, after a moments startlement, nodded in answer.Oh, yes, to be sure.Fine ealthy little lad,e is, too, or so I ear.I thought you knew aready.Its is mother thats dead.That blunt statement struck the kitchen with silence.Even Jeffries was still for a moment, sobered by death.Then he crossed himself quickly, muttered, God rest her soul, and swallowed the rest of his brandy.Jamie could feel his own throat burning, whether with brandy or tears, he could not say.Shock and grief choked him like a ball of yarn wedged in his gullet; he could barely manage to croak, When?This morning, the cook said, wagging her head mournfully.Just afore noon, poor girl.They thought for a time as shed be all right, after the babe was born; Mary Ann said she was sittin up, holdin the wee thing and laughin.She sighed heavily at the thought.But then near dawn, she started to bleed again bad.They called back the doctor, and he came fast as could be, but  The door slamming open interrupted her.It was Mary Ann, eyes wide under her cap, gasping with excitement and exertion.Your master wants you!she blurted out, eyes flicking between Jamie and the coachman.The both of ye, at once, and oh, sirshe gulped, nodding at Jeffrieshe says for Gods sake, to bring your pistols!The coachman exchanged a glance of consternation with Jamie, then leapt to his feet and dashed out, in the direction of the stables.Like most coachmen, he carried a pair of loaded pistols beneath his seat, against the possibility of highwaymen.It would take Jeffries a few minutes to find the arms, and longer if he waited to check that the priming had not been harmed by the wet weather.Jamie rose to his feet and gripped the dithering maidservant by the arm.Show me to the study, he said.Now!The sound of raised voices would have led him there, once he had reached the head of the stair.Pushing past Mary Ann without ceremony, he paused for a moment outside the door, uncertain whether he should enter at once, or wait for Jeffries.That you can have the sheer heartless effrontery to make such accusations!Dunsany was saying, his old mans voice shaking with rage and distress.And my poor lamb not cold in her bed!You blackguard, you poltroon!I will not suffer the child to stay a single night under your roof!The little bastard stays here!Ellesmeres voice rasped hoarsely.It would have been apparent to a far less experienced observer that his Lordship was well the worse for drink.Bastard that he is, hes my heir, and he stays with me!Hes bought and paid for, and if his dam was a whore, at least she gave me a boy.Damn you!Dunsanys voice had reached such a pitch of shrillness that it was scarcely more than a squeak, but the outrage in it was clear nonetheless.Bought?Youyouyou dare to suggest  I dont suggest.Ellesmeres voice was still hoarse, but under better control.You sold me your daughterand under false pretenses, I might add, the hoarse voice said sarcastically.I paid thirty thousand pound for a virgin of good name.The first condition wasnt met, and I take leave to doubt the second.The sound of liquid being poured came through the door, followed by the scrape of a glass across a wooden tabletop.I would suggest that your burden of spirits is already excessive, sir, Dunsany said.His voice shook with an obvious attempt at mastery of his emotions.I can only attribute the disgusting slurs you have cast upon my daughters purity to your apparent intoxication.That being so, I shall take my grandson, and go.Oh, your grandson, is it?Ellesmeres voice was slurred and sneering.You seem damned sure of your daughters purity.Sure the brat isnt yours?She said  He broke off with a cry of astonishment, accompanied by a crash.Not daring to wait longer, Jamie plunged through the door, to find Ellesmere and Lord Dunsany entangled on the hearthrug, rolling to and fro in a welter of coats and limbs, both heedless of the fire behind them.He took a moment to appraise the situation, then, seizing a fortuitous opening, reached into the fray and snatched his employer upright.Be still, my lord, he muttered in Dunsanys ear, dragging him back from Ellesmeres gasping form.Then, Give over, ye auld fool!he hissed, as Dunsany went on mindlessly struggling to reach his opponent.Ellesmere was almost as old as Dunsany, but more strongly built and clearly in better health, despite his drunkenness.The Earl staggered to his feet, balding hair disheveled and bloodshot eyes glaring fixedly at Dunsany.He wiped his spittle flecked mouth with the back of his hand, fat shoulders heaving.Filth, he said, almost conversationally.Lay handson me, would you?Still gasping for breath, he lurched toward the bell rope.It was by no means certain that Lord Dunsany would stay on his feet, but there was no time to worry about that.Jamie let go of his employer, and lunged for Ellesmeres groping hand.No, my lord, he said, as respectfully as possible.Holding Ellesmere in a crude bear leading embrace, he forced the heavyset Earl back across the room.I think it would beunwiseto involve yourservants.Grunting, he pushed Ellesmere into a chair.Best stay there, my lord.Jeffries, a drawn pistol in each hand, advanced warily into the room, his darting glance divided between Ellesmere, struggling to rise from the depths of the armchair, and Lord Dunsany, who clung precariously to a table edge, his aged face white as paper.Jeffries glanced at Dunsany for instructions, and seeing none forthcoming, instinctively looked to Jamie.Jamie was conscious of a monstrous irritation; why should he be expected to deal with this imbroglio?Still, it was important that the Helwater party remove themselves from the premises with all haste.He stepped forward and took Dunsany by the arm.Let us go now, my lord, he said.Detaching the wilting Dunsany from the table, he tried to edge the tall old nobleman toward the door.Just at this moment of escape, though, the door was blocked.William?Lady Dunsanys round face, splotched with the marks of recent grief, showed a sort of dull bewilderment at the scene in the study.In her arms was what looked like a large, untidy bundle of washing.She lifted this in a movement of vague inquiry.The maid said you wanted me to bring the baby.What A roar from Ellesmere interrupted her.Heedless of the pointing pistols, the Earl sprang from his chair and shoved the gawking Jeffries out of the way.Hes mine!Knocking Lady Dunsany roughly against the paneling, Ellesmere snatched the bundle from her arms.Clutching it to his bosom, the Earl retreated toward the window.He glared at Dunsany, panting like a cornered beast.Mine, dye hear?The bundle emitted a loud shriek, as if in protest at this asseveration, and Dunsany, roused from his shock by the sight of his grandson in Ellesmeres arms, started forward, his features contorted in fury.Give him to me!Go to hell, you codless scut!With an unforeseen agility, Ellesmere dodged away from Dunsany.He flung back the draperies and cranked the window open with one hand, clutching the wailing child with the other.Getoutofmyhouse!he panted, gasping with each revolution that edged the casement wider.Go!Now, or Ill drop the little bastard, I swear I will!To mark his threat, he thrust the yelling bundle toward the sill, and the empty dark where the wet stones of the courtyard waited, thirty feet below.Past all conscious thought or any fear of consequence, Jamie Fraser acted on the instinct that had seen him through a dozen battles.He snatched one pistol from the transfixed Jeffries, turned on his heel, and fired in the same motion.The roar of the shot struck everyone silent.Even the child ceased to scream.Ellesmeres face went quite blank, thick eyebrows raised in question.Then he staggered, and Jamie leapt forward, noting with a sort of detached clarity the small round hole in the babys trailing drapery, where the pistol ball had passed through it.He stood then rooted on the hearthrug, heedless of the fire scorching the backs of his legs, of the still heaving body of Ellesmere at his feet, of the regular, hysterical shrieks of Lady Dunsany, piercing as a peacocks.He stood, eyes tight closed, shaking like a leaf, unable either to move or to think, arms wrapped tight about the shapeless, squirming, squawking bundle that contained his son.I wish to speak to MacKenzie.Alone.Lady Dunsany looked distinctly out of place in the stable.Small, plump, and impeccable in black linen, she looked like a china ornament, removed from its spot of cherished safety on the mantelpiece, and in imminent and constant peril of breakage, here in this world of rough animals and unshaven men.Hughes, with a glance of complete astonishment at his mistress, bowed and tugged at his forelock before retreating to his den behind the tack room, leaving MacKenzie face to face with her.Close to, the impression of fragility was heightened by the paleness of her face, touched faintly with pink at the corners of nose and eyes.She looked like a very small and dignified rabbit, dressed in mourning.Jamie felt that he should ask her to sit down, but there was no place for her to sit, save on a pile of hay or an upturned barrow.The coroners court met this morning, MacKenzie, she said.Aye, milady.He had known thatthey all had, and the other grooms had kept their distance from him all morning.Not out of respect; out of the dread for one who suffers from a deadly disease.Jeffries knew what had happened in the drawing room at Ellesmere, and that meant all the servants knew.But no one spoke of it.The verdict of the court was that the Earl of Ellesmere met his death by misadventure.The coroners theory is that his lordship wasdistraughtshe made a faint moue of distasteover my daughters death.Her voice quivered faintly, but did not break.The fragile Lady Dunsany had borne up much better beneath the tragedy than had her husband; the servants rumor had it that his lordship had not risen from his bed since his return from Ellesmere.Aye, milady?Jeffries had been called to give evidence.MacKenzie had not.So far as the coroners court was concerned, the groom MacKenzie had never set foot on Ellesmere.Lady Dunsanys eyes met his, straight on.They were a pale bluish green, like her daughter Isobels, but the blond hair that glowed on Isobel was faded on her mother, touched with white strands that shone silver in the sun from the open door of the stable.We are grateful to you, MacKenzie, she said quietly.Thank ye, milady.Very grateful, she repeated, still gazing at him intently.MacKenzie isnt your real name, is it?she said suddenly.No, milady.A sliver of ice ran down his spine, despite the warmth of the afternoon sun on his shoulders.How much had the Lady Geneva told her mother before her death?She seemed to feel his stiffening, for the edge of her mouth lifted in what he thought was meant as a smile of reassurance.I think I need not ask what it is, just yet, she said.But I do have a question for you.MacKenziedo you want to go home?Home?He repeated the word blankly.To Scotland.She was watching him intently.I know who you are, she said.Not your name, but that youre one of Johns Jacobite prisoners.My husband told me.Jamie watched her warily, but she didnt seem upset; no more so than would be natural in a woman who has just lost a daughter and gained a grandson, at least.I hope you will forgive the deception, milady, he said.His Lordship  Wished to save me distress, Lady Dunsany finished for him.Yes, I know.William worries too much.Still, the deep line between her brows relaxed a bit at the thought of her husbands concern.The sight, with its underlying echo of marital devotion, gave him a faint and unexpected pang.We are not richyou will have gathered that from Ellesmeres remarks, Lady Dunsany went on.Helwater is rather heavily in debt.My grandson, however, is now the possessor of one of the largest fortunes in the county.There seemed nothing to say to this but Aye, milady?though it made him feel rather like the parrot who lived in the main salon.He had seen it as he crept stealthily through the flowerbeds at sunset the day before, taking the chance of approaching the house while the family were dressing for dinner, in an attempt to catch a glimpse through a window of the new Earl of Ellesmere.We are very retired here, she went on.We seldom visit London, and my husband has little influence in high circles.But  Aye, milady?He had some inkling by now of where her ladyship was heading with this roundabout conversation, and a feeling of sudden excitement hollowed the space beneath his ribs.JohnLord John Grey, that iscomes from a family with considerable influence.His stepfather iswell, thats of no consequence.She shrugged, the small black linen shoulders dismissing the details.The point is that it might be possible to exert sufficient influence on your behalf to have you released from the conditions of your parole, so that you might return to Scotland.So I have come to ask youdo you want to go home, MacKenzie?He felt quite breathless, as though someone had punched him very hard in the stomach.Scotland.To go away from this damp, spongy atmosphere, set foot on that forbidden road and walk it with a free, long stride, up into the crags and along the deer trails, to feel the air clearing and sharpening with the scent of gorse and heather.To go home!To be a stranger no longer.To go away from hostility and loneliness, come down into Lallybroch, and see his sisters face light with joy at the sight of him, feel her arms around his waist, Ians hug about his shoulders and the pummeling, grasping clutch of the childrens hands, tugging at his clothes.To go away, and never to see or hear of his own child again.He stared at Lady Dunsany, his face quite blank, so that she should not guess at the turmoil her offer had caused within him.He had, at last, found the baby yesterday, lying asleep in a basket near the nursery window on the second floor.Perched precariously on the branch of a huge Norway spruce, he had strained his eyes to see through the screen of needles that hid him.The childs face had been visible only in profile, one fat cheek resting on its ruffled shoulder.Its cap had slipped awry, so he could see the smooth, arching curve of the tiny skull, lightly dusted with a pale gold fuzz.Thank God it isnt red, had been his first thought, and he had crossed himself in reflexive thanksgiving.God, hes so small!had been his second, coupled with an overwhelming urge to step through the window and pick the boy up.The smooth, beautifully shaped head would just fit, resting in the palm of his hand, and he could feel in memory the small squirming body that he had held so briefly to his heart.Youre a strong laddie, he had whispered.Strong and braw and bonny.But my God, you are so small!Lady Dunsany was waiting patiently.He bowed his head respectfully to her, not knowing whether he was making a terrible mistake, but unable to do otherwise.I thank ye, milady, butI think I shall not gojust yet.One pale eyebrow quivered slightly, but she inclined her head to him with equal grace.As you wish, MacKenzie.You have only to ask.She turned like a tiny clockwork figure and left, going back to the world of Helwater, a thousand times more his prison now than it had ever been.16  WILLIE  To his extreme surprise, the next few years were in many ways among the happiest of Jamie Frasers life, aside from the years of his marriage.Relieved of responsibility for tenants, followers, or anyone at all beyond himself and the horses in his charge, life was relatively simple.While the coroners court had taken no notice of him, Jeffries had let slip enough about the death of Ellesmere that the other servants treated him with distant respect, but did not presume on his company.He had enough to eat, sufficient clothes to keep warm and decent, and the occasional discreet letter from the Highlands reassured him that similar conditions obtained there.One unexpected benefit of the quiet life at Helwater was that he had somehow resumed his odd half friendship with Lord John Grey.The Major had, as promised, appeared once each quarter, staying each time for a few days to visit with the Dunsanys.He had made no attempt to gloat, though, or even to speak with Jamie, beyond the barest formal inquiry.Very slowly, Jamie had realized all that Lady Dunsany had implied, in her offer to have him released.JohnLord John Grey, that iscomes from a family with considerable influence.His stepfather iswell, thats of no consequence, she had said.It was of consequence, though.It had not been His Majestys pleasure that had brought him here, rather than condemning him to the perilous ocean crossing and near slavery in America; it had been John Greys influence.And he had not done it for revenge or from indecent motives, for he never gloated, made no advances; never said anything beyond the most commonplace civilities.No, he had brought Jamie here because it was the best he could do; unable simply to release him at the time, Grey had done his best to ease the conditions of captivityby giving him air, and light, and horses.It took some effort, but he did it.When Grey next appeared in the stableyard on his quarterly visit, Jamie had waited until the Major was alone, admiring the conformation of a big sorrel gelding.He had come to stand beside Grey, leaning on the fence.They watched the horse in silence for several minutes.Kings pawn to king four, Jamie said quietly at last, not looking at the man beside him.He felt the others start of surprise, and felt Greys eyes on him, but didnt turn his head.Then he felt the creak of the wood beneath his forearm as Grey turned back, leaning on the fence again.Queens knight to queen bishop three, Grey replied, his voice a little huskier than usual.Since then, Grey had come to the stables during each visit, to spend an evening perched on Jamies crude stool, talking.They had no chessboard and seldom played verbally, but the late night conversations continuedJamies only connection with the world beyond Helwater, and a small pleasure to which both of them looked forward once each quarter.Above everything else, he had Willie.Helwater was dedicated to horses; even before the boy could stand solidly on his feet, his grandfather had him propped on a pony to be led round the paddock.By the time Willie was three, he was riding by himselfunder the watchful eye of MacKenzie, the groom.Willie was a strong, courageous, bonny little lad.He had a blinding smile, and could charm birds from the trees if he liked.He was also remarkably spoilt.As the ninth Earl of Ellesmere and the only heir to both Ellesmere and Helwater, with neither mother nor father to keep him under control, he ran roughshod over his doting grandparents, his young aunt, and every servant in the placeexcept MacKenzie.And that was a near thing.So far, threats of not allowing the boy to help him with the horses had sufficed to quash Willies worst excesses in the stables, but sooner or later, threats alone were not going to be sufficient, and MacKenzie the groom found himself wondering just what was going to happen when he finally lost his own control and clouted the wee fiend.As a lad, he would himself have been beaten senseless by the nearest male relative within earshot, had he ever dared to address a woman the way he had heard Willie speak to his aunt and the maidservants, and the impulse to haul Willie into a deserted box stall and attempt to correct his manners was increasingly frequent.Still, for the most part, he had nothing but joy in Willie.The boy adored MacKenzie, and as he grew older would spend hours in his company, riding on the huge draft horses as they pulled the heavy roller through the high fields, and perched precariously on the hay wagons as they came down from the upper pastures in summer.There was a threat to this peaceful existence, though, which grew greater with each passing month.Ironically, the threat came from Willie himself, and was one he could not help.What a handsome little lad he is, to be sure!And such a lovely little rider!It was Lady Grozier who spoke, standing on the veranda with Lady Dunsany to admire Willies peregrinations on his pony around the edge of the lawn.Willies grandmother laughed, eyeing the boy fondly.Oh, yes.He loves his pony.We have a terrible time getting him even to come indoors for meals.And hes even more fond of his groom.We joke sometimes that he spends so much time with MacKenzie that hes even starting to look like MacKenzie!Lady Grozier, who had of course paid no attention to a groom, now glanced in MacKenzies direction.Why, youre right!she exclaimed, much amused.Just look; Willies got just that same cock to his head, and the same set to his shoulders!How funny!Jamie bowed respectfully to the ladies, but felt cold sweat pop out on his face.He had seen this coming, but hadnt wanted to believe the resemblance was sufficiently pronounced as to be visible to anyone but himself.Willie as a baby had been fat and pudding faced, and resembled no one at all.As he had grown, though, the pudginess had vanished from cheeks and chin, and while his nose was still the soft snub of childhood, the hint of high, broad cheekbones was apparent, and the slaty blue eyes of babyhood had grown dark blue and clear, thickly fringed with sooty lashes, and slightly slanted in appearance.Once the ladies had gone into the house, and he could be sure no one was watching, Jamie passed a hand furtively over his own features.Was the resemblance truly that great?Willies hair was a soft middle brown, with just a tinge of his mothers chestnut gleam.And those large, translucent earssurely his own didnt stick out like that?The trouble was that Jamie Fraser had not actually seen himself clearly for several years.Grooms did not have looking glasses, and he had sedulously avoided the company of the maids, who might have provided him with one.Moving to the watering trough, he bent over it, casually, as though inspecting one of the water striders that skated over its surface.Beneath the wavering surface, flecked with floating bits of hay and crisscrossed by the dimpling striders, his own face stared up at him.He swallowed, and saw the reflections throat move.It was by no means a complete resemblance, but it was definitely there.More in the set and shape of the head and shoulders, as Lady Grozier had observedbut most definitely the eyes as well.Fraser eyes; his father, Brian, had had them, and his sister, Jenny, as well.Let the boys bones go on pressing through his skin; let the child snub nose grow long and straight, and the cheekbones still broaderand anyone would be able to see it.The reflection in the trough vanished as he straightened up, and stood, staring blindly at the stable that had been home for the last several years.It was July and the sun was hot, but it made no impression on the chill that numbed his fingers and sent a shiver up his back.It was time to speak to Lady Dunsany.By the middle of September, everything had been arranged.The pardon had been procured; John Grey had brought it the day before.Jamie had a small amount of money saved, enough for traveling expenses, and Lady Dunsany had given him a decent horse.The only thing that remained was to bid farewell to his acquaintances at Helwaterand Willie.I shall be leaving tomorrow.Jamie spoke matter of factly, not taking his eyes off the bay mares fetlock.The horny growth he was filing flaked away, leaving a dust of coarse black shavings on the stable floor.Where are you going?To Derwentwater?Can I come with you?William, Viscount Dunsany, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, hopped down from the edge of the box stall, landing with a thump that made the bay mare start and snort.Dont do that, Jamie said automatically.Have I not told ye to move quiet near Milly?Shes skittish.Why?Youd be skittish, too, if I squeezed your knee.One big hand darted out and pinched the muscle just above the boys knee.Willie squeaked and jerked back, giggling.Can I ride Millyflower when youre done, Mac?No, Jamie answered patiently, for the dozenth time that day.Ive told ye a thousand times, shes too big for ye yet.But I want to ride her!Jamie sighed but didnt answer, instead moving around to the other side of Milles Fleurs and picking up the left hoof.I said I want to ride Milly!I heard ye.Then saddle her for me!Right now!The ninth Earl of Ellesmere had his chin thrust out as far as it would go, but the defiant look in his eye was tempered with a certain doubt as he intercepted Jamies cold blue gaze.Jamie set the horses hoof down slowly, just as slowly stood up, and drawing himself to his full height of six feet four, put his hands on his hips, looked down at the Earl, three feet six, and said, very softly, No.Yes!Willie stamped his foot on the hay strewn floor.You have to do what I tell you!No, I dont.Yes, you do!No, I Shaking his head hard enough to make the red hair fly about his ears, Jamie pressed his lips tight together, then squatted down in front of the boy.See here, he said, I havena got to do what ye say, for Im no longer going to be groom here.I told ye, I shall be leaving tomorrow.Willies face went quite blank with shock, and the freckles on his nose stood out dark against the fair skin.You cant!he said.You cant leave.I have to.No!The small Earl clenched his jaw, which gave him a truly startling resemblance to his paternal great grandfather.Jamie thanked his stars that no one at Helwater had likely ever seen Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat.I wont let you go!For once, my lord, ye have nothing to say about it, Jamie replied firmly, his distress at leaving tempered somewhat by finally being allowed to speak his mind to the boy.If you leave Willie looked around helplessly for a threat, and spotted one easily to hand.If you leave, he repeated more confidently, Ill scream and shout and scare all the horses, so there!Make a peep, ye little fiend, and Ill smack ye a good one!Freed from his usual reserve, and alarmed at the thought of this spoiled brat upsetting the highly strung and valuable horses, Jamie glared at the boy.The Earls eyes bulged with rage, and his face went red.He took a deep breath, then whirled and ran down the length of the stable, shrieking and waving his arms.Milles Fleurs, already on edge from having her hoofs fiddled with, reared and plunged, neighing loudly.Her distress was echoed by kicks and high pitched whinnying from the box stalls nearby, where Willie was roaring out all the bad words he knewno small storeand kicking frenziedly at the doors of the stalls.Jamie succeeded in catching Milles Fleurss lead rope and with considerable effort, managed to get the mare outside without damage to himself or the horse.He tied her to the paddock fence, and then strode back into the stable to deal with Willie.Damn, damn, damn!the Earl was shrieking.Sluire!Quim!Shit!Swive!Without a word, Jamie grabbed the boy by the collar, lifted him off his feet and carried him, kicking and squirming, to the farriers stool he had been using.Here he sat down, flipped the Earl over his knee, and smacked his buttocks five or six times, hard.Then he jerked the boy up and set him on his feet.I hate you!The Viscounts tear smudged face was bright red and his fists trembled with rage.Well, Im no verra fond of you either, ye little bastard!Jamie snapped.Willie drew himself up, fists clenched, purple in the face.Im not a bastard!he shrieked.Im not, Im not!Take it back!Nobody can say that to me!Take it back, I said!Jamie stared at the boy in shock.There had been talk, then, and Willie had heard it.He had delayed his going too long.He drew a deep breath, and then another, and hoped that his voice would not tremble.I take it back, he said softly.I shouldna have used the word, my lord.He wanted to kneel and embrace the boy, or pick him up and comfort him against his shoulderbut that was not a gesture a groom might make to an earl, even a young one.The palm of his left hand stung, and he curled his fingers tight over the only fatherly caress he was ever likely to give his son.Willie knew how an earl should behave; he was making a masterful effort to subdue his tears, sniffing ferociously and swiping at his face with a sleeve.Allow me, my lord.Jamie did kneel then, and wiped the little boys face gently with his own coarse handkerchief.Willies eyes looked at him over the cotton folds, red rimmed and woeful.Have you really got to go, Mac?he asked, in a very small voice.Aye, I have.He looked into the dark blue eyes, so heartbreakingly like his own, and suddenly didnt give a damn what was right or who saw.He pulled the boy roughly to him, hugging him tight against his heart, holding the boys face close to his shoulder, that Willie might not see the quick tears that fell into his thick, soft hair.Willies arms went around his neck and clung tight.He could feel the small, sturdy body shake against him with the force of suppressed sobbing.
