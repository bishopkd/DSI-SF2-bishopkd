And more yet when Bran strolled in, spun her into a kiss.Its pretty, Annika said, with a long, long sigh.Kissings pretty.Lets be pretty again.Bran grabbed Sasha back, dipped her a little this time.Id say youre not tired now.Though her pulse skipped and danced, Sasha turned to get Bran a glass.Im making some progress on a spell.Not quite there, but definite progress.Thats just something you dont hear every day, is it?Progress on a spell.In my world.Bran took the wine she offered.Whatever youre cooking there, Sawyer, smells brilliant.About ten minutes to go, and well see if it tastes the same.Since Annikas the sous chef tonight, well set the table.Sasha turned, started to stack six plates, remembered.I guess Rileys having dinner with one of her contacts, but somebody should let Doyle know were about to eat.Ill take these.Bran took the stack of five.And let him know.Maybe shell make it back before we sit down.Annika rubbed Sawyers arm.You shouldnt worry.Riley is very smart and very strong.Sasha thought it excellent advice, and tried to take it.By the time theyd finished the mealwith compliments to the chef and his apprentice, as there was barely a grain of rice leftthe sun had set, the moon, fat and white, had risen.Maybe a couple of us ought to go down and look for her.Doyle arched eyebrows at Sawyer.In what?Your bike?She doesnt have a curfew, Daddy.If she was the damsel in distress sort, yeah, we could go down, slay the dragon for her.But shes got a Beretta, a combat knife, and a badass attitude.She can take care of herself.Plus.He wagged his beer.If shes hooked up with one of her contacts, shed be pretty pissed with the white knight routine.Well, Im worried, too.I didnt think she meant it about not coming back tonight.And.Sasha lifted her phone.Shes not answering my texts.She answered mine, Bran commented.Yours?When?Before I came down.I just sent her one that asked if all was well.She texted back: Five by five.Precisely that.What, precisely, does five by five mean?Its all good, Doyle told Sasha.Everythings fine.She added shed likely bunk in the village with a friend.What friend?Sasha stopped herself, huffed out a breath.None of our business.And Doyles right.If anyones armed and dangerous, its Riley Gwin.Im just jumpy because Ive gotten used to everyone being right here.Sasha pushed up, grabbed empty plates.Im going to do the dishes until I stop being jumpy.When the dishes werent enough, she scrubbed down the kitchen.She was looking for something else to clean when she spotted Bran leaning against the door watching her.Still jumpy then?I cant get rid of it.I have just the thing.He grabbed a bottle of wine, two glasses, then her hand.Come with me.Where?Well have a drink on the terrace, you and I.  Its as you said earlier, everyone seems to have closed up in their separate spaces.Maybe we all need that for a night.But you and I have another need, to my mind.Were having a date.A date?We are.A drink on the terrace in the moonlight, conversation about nothing that troubles you.And when Ive softened you up with the wine, Ill take you inside and have my way with you.You dont need the wine for that.Youre a gift to me, fidh, thats the truth.But wine and conversation make a nice prelude.You had a bit of that conversation with Doyle on the boat.He asked if I inherited the sight.You know, I never thought of it?Surprised at herself, she shook her head.I never asked if someone in the family before me had it.No one ever spoke of it, so I assumed I was the only one.I was the oddity.Theres a difference between the odd and the special.Im getting there.I think we wereareso closed up in my family.If theres a problem, lock it away or cover it with excuses.Youre not a problemand no one should be allowed, even yourself, to think of you that way.Maybe thats why its been so easy to be part of thisno one considers me a problem.And its why it was so easy for me to move away.I love my mother, but weve both been fine with phone calls, emails, the rare and short visit.Just not a lot of common ground, I guess.Would you ask her nowif thered been anyone else in the family with your gift?I might, if I feel a need to know.Shed tell me if I really pushed it.I dont think shed lie to me, and Id know if she did.But ...She looked up at the full, white moon sailing over the dark sea.It doesnt seem very important anymore.She sipped wine, smiled when he took her hand in his.I used to hate dating, so I gave it up.Ive changed my mind.Well have to make time for a true one.This is true.More true, more real, more lovely than any shed ever had.And perfect to her mind.A soft night, a full moon, the song of the waves, and a hand clasping hers.He gave her romance again.When he rose, she stood with him, turned to him.Jumpy now?No.But I think Im going to be.She wrapped around him.She pulled him close.She took his mouth this time.And reveled in the knowledge she could.Lets close ourselves off, she murmured, in our separate place.You undo me, Sasha.He turned her into the room, shut the door behind them.The moonlight was enough, sliding pale and blue into the room.It felt like a dance, twining her arms around him, circling with him toward the bed.She rose up to meet his mouth with hers, and thought what a wonder to have found so much so fast.To be able to close out everything but this, but him.To know that here, that now, he belonged to her.He pulled the clip from her hair so it tumbled down.Sunlight to vie with the moon.She was warm silk in his hands, and he thought it miraculous to be given someone so open, so honest.Beyond the face and form that pulled at himhad pulled at him from the firsthe marveled at her generosity of spirit, and the courage she failed to recognize.To have such a partner in this dark quest was more than hed ever believed in.Her hands, those strong artists fingers, ran under his shirt, kindling new fires of lust.He laid her back on the bed, warning himself to have care.There was still an innocence in her.She shifted over him, even that casual move warring with his control.And smiling, traced his face with her fingertips.I know this face, so well.So many dreams.It terrified me.Why?What if?She glided her finger over his cheekbones, his mouth, the line of his jaw.If I could create my perfect lover?Man of my dreams.But he would only be there.On a sigh, she rested her brow to his for a moment.On my canvas, in my mind.Only there.And when I woke or put my brush down, Id be alone.Youre not alone.I thought it was best to be, so convinced myself I wanted to be.She touched her lips to his.I want so much more now.Thats a little scary, too.She brushed her lips where her fingers had glided.I dreamed of us like this so many times.I want to try to show you.And as shed dreamed it, she touched her lips to his, a bare whisper.Once, twice, before easing his shirt up his torso and away.Her body to pleasure now, all the long lines of it.Her mouth to tempt with another whispering brush.Her lips glided over his jaw, down that strong column of throat.A pulse beat there, and she knew the thrill of making it quicken.Knew the power and pleasure of moving down, learning his secrets as he had learned hers.He fisted a hand at the back of her shirt, fought the brutal urge to just rip it away and take.He would let her set the pace, the tone, and her slow, yes, dreamy, explorations taught him the gilded torture of pleasure.In moonlight and shadows, with sighs and whispers, she undressed him.And she glided them along layers, shimmering, building layers of sensation.The air seemed to thicken with it, movements languid, pulses thrumming.Her body slid up his again, inch by quivering inch, until her mouth took his.No whispering brush this time, but a strong, deep mating, one that poured emotion into him until he ached with it.She rose up, struck by moonlight, tossing her hair back as she crossed her arms to pull her shirt up.When he reached for her, she shook her head, and moved to undress as shed undressed him.Slowly, torturously.My dream, she reminded him.She clung to that, moved now as shed moved then to straddle him.And with her eyes on his, slowly, slowly, took him in.He heard her breath catch as her hands pressed to her breasts.I need I need to  			She began to rock; she began to ride.You undo me, hed said, but he hadnt known how completely she could rule him.He was bewitched, bespelled, enthralled as she took him with undulating hips.Blue tipped fingers of moonlight washing her skin, her hair a pale curtain of sunlight in shadows.And her body fluid as water, then taut as a bow as she took herself over.When she peaked, he rose up to her, wrapped her to him.Heart to heart he took her up again, and let himself fly with her.He held her, stroking her hair, her back, trying to level himself again.No woman had ever taken him over so completely, had ever tangled body, heart, mind so thoroughly.He wasnt altogether sure how he felt about it.Then she sighed his name, just his name, and he decided hed think later.About these dreams of yours.She laughed, sighed again.There were about three months worth.That ought to keep us busy.He eased back to look at her.But now youre sleepy.I can see it.Relaxed.Well both stay that way.Tomorrows bound to be as demanding as today.Is Riley back, do you think?Maybe I should check.Shell be back by morning.He eased her down, curled her in.And when she drifted off, slipped out to work.An hour or two, he thought, and he might have something he could use if her vision that morning came calling.* * *  			He spent longer than hed planned, and calculated hed squeeze in three hours sleep beside her before dawn broke.The power hed pulled on still tingled along his skin.Perhaps that was why she murmured in her sleep, trembled a little.Once again he curled her against him, soothing them both until he could drop into sleep with her.He woke in the dark.She stood in the moonlight, her body tense and turned toward the doors.What is it?Theyre coming.Get up, get dressed.We dont have much time.He flicked a hand to bring in more light.Dream walking, he noted when he saw her eyes.Whats coming?Her dogs.Ours know it.Cant you hear them howling?Hurry.She grabbed her clothes, began to yank them on as he got out of bed.Wheres my bow?she demanded.Your bow?There it is.She picked up ...nothing.Made motions as if slinging a strap over her back.Hurry, Bran, we have to wake the others.I will.He tugged on pants.Stay here.Sasha, wait for me.Hurry.Stay here.He went out, banged a fist on Sawyers door.Get up!he called out.Get the others.Somethings coming.He didnt wait, but turned toward his own room before Sawyer pushed open the door.What?I dont know what.Bran kept moving.But get the others, and get armed.He took time to grab a shirt, a knife, and several of the vials of the potion hed just made.Hed planned for them to cure several more hours, but theyd have to do.When he pushed back into Sashas room, shed pulled on boots, a jacket.Dream struck still, he thought, but she looked ...tougher, bolder.He debated a moment, but when he heard Apollo howl, a long, deep warning, he knew he couldnt leave her dreaming.He moved to her, set his hands on her shoulders.Wake, he ordered.Wake now.She blinked, jerked back.What ...Apollo howled again, and the call was answered by another.Deeper, more feral.Not a dream, she said.Take this.He took her hand, put the knife in it.Its enchanted.Trust it, and yourself.I need you to stay close to me, Sasha.Theyre coming.What I saw this morning.I think yes.We cant risk staying inside, waiting to see what theyll do.No.She looked down at the knife, that bright, sharp silver.And prayed her hand wouldnt shake.The others.Coming.You warned us in time.Close to me, he repeated, and moved to the terrace doors.The wind blew in, and carried an ugly hint of something foul.It amazed her how he stepped out into it, without hesitation.She took a breath, gripped the knife, and stepped out with him.Close the doors, he told her as he scanned sea and sky.No point issuing an invitation.I dont see anything yet.But  			Theyre coming.You had the right of it.We make a stand, I think, away from the house.Clearer ground, Doyle said, and with his coat flapping around his knees, he strode across the terrace toward them.Around by the olive grove.And cover in there if we need it.He sniffed the air like a wolf.Hell smoke.It aint my sisters perfume.Sawyer, a gun at each hip, came toward them with Annika.I locked Apollo in, Annika said as he continued to howl.He could get hurt if he came out.Hell be fine.Sawyer gave her shoulder a squeeze.Rileys not back, so were one short.But.He patted his guns.Were ready.About an hour before dawn, Doyle said as they went down together.A kind of transition time, right?Maybe thats what you meant.I dont know.Sasha shook her head.But the moonlights fading, isnt it?Thats to their advantage.Or ours.Bran took out the vials.What you got?Sawyer asked.Something I wish had more time to build, but itll have to do.I need to place these at the points of the compass.There.Sasha gestured to the cloud that swept over the sea.Theyre coming.Well, keep them off me best you canand her, he added, until I get them set.Well drive as many as we can toward the points.That should even the odds.She wanted to call him back when he ran off, but Doyle was already snapping orders.Form a circle.Draw them to us until Mr.Magic does what he does.Sawyer drew both his guns.No problem.The wind rose to whirl, snapping through the trees.Howls rolled over it in a kind of feral desperation.Then came the high pitched screams of what boiled over the sea.Fear wanted to tear out of her throat in a scream of her own.Her breath whistled with it as Doyle ranged himself beside her.Dont think, she ordered herself.If she allowed herself to think of what was coming, she might run.Remember.Remember the dreams of battle, and fight.The first shots jolted through her, and she saw two of those twisted bodies flash, tumble out of the fetid cloud.Then more until the air stank of gunpowder and viscous smoke.And they poured down in a wave, armed with tooth and claw.She felt as much as saw the sharp slice of Doyles sword cleaving obscene heads from bodies.As shots rang out, as Annikas flying feet pummeled, she found her arm, her feet, her fist knew what to do.She hacked, punched, pivoted.The blood raining from the smoking bodies was a hot, quick sting on the skin.She couldnt see Bran as she hacked out with the knife, and prayed he hadnt been overwhelmed.With a furious growl, Apollo streaked by her, leaped up to snag one of the winged dogs in his jaws, shake it.She nearly broke ranks when she saw a section of the cloud break off to attack him.In a blur of speed a dark shape leaped out of the shadows, soared over Apollos back, claws raking the attackers, jaws snapping.Doyles sword swept down behind her seconds before fangs sank into her back.Watch your six, Blondie.The words echoed in her head, along with gunshots, shrieks, howls, as she jabbed out to spear one of Nerezzas creatures.Suddenly, she knew.North.Bran needs us to push them north, she shouted.She didnt wait; she ran.Cursing, Doyle charged after her.Apollo streaked by them, hard on the heel of the dark dognot dog, she saw now; the wolf.Gunfire cut a swath, tearing wings, shattering bodies, and still they came.Through the haze of smoke, she saw Bran, standing, arms raised, as if calling the beasts to him.Fear struck like an arrow, vibrated in her cry of his name.But he stood even as the killing cloud swooped toward him.Brace yourself!he called out.He flung his arms wide.The light flashed, red as blood, hot as tongues from hell.The force of it would have shot her back if Doyle hadnt gripped her arm.Blinded by it, she had only instinct and dream memory.East.She choked it out, stumbled.Clockwise.Drive them east.It all whirled into a mad blur, the insanity of death and battle, hot blood, the stink of smoke.The light flashed again, mushrooming up to fill the world with its power and doom.Talons caught in her hair.As she batted at them, the wolf sprang.The shriek of her attacker snapped off in its jaws, then she lost it in the haze.Light exploded from the south, and this time the power of it lifted her off her feet.Breathless, ears throbbing, she gained her hands and knees.By the time she managed to stand again, shed lost all sense of direction.Howls, gunfire, screams, shouts, all muffled by the haze.She made out the shadows of those who fought with her, the gnarled silhouettes of what attacked.She turned toward them, but a sudden flurry of wings cut her off, left her no route but retreat.Then Brans arm swung around her, nearly lifted her off her feet a second time.Youre too close.Stay behind me.Behind me, Sasha, and cover your eyes.She felt it rock the ground under her feet, sing like raw nerves up her body.Even with an arm flung over her eyes, that red light filled her head.The power he loosed seared along her skin, swam in her blood.She went down to her knees when her legs buckled, fingers digging into the grass as the ground shook.Stand clear, he called out.Keep back, and let me finish it.In my light you burn.Through our wrath you churn.Let what made you see our power, and know that in this hour as our seer did foretell, we send her dogs back to hell.By the power given me, as I will, so mote it be.There was a terrible scream, like a thousand voices raised in fury.Not a thousand, Sasha realized.Just one.Nerezza.Are you hurt?Bran pulled her to her feet.I dont know.Youre bleeding.His face, she saw.His arms, his hands.Likely we all are.But this is done for the night.Let me clear some of the bloody smoke, he began, but Sawyer pushed through it, an arm clutched around Annika to support her.Shes hurt.Her legs the worst.Blood oozed from the gash that sliced from her knee to her ankle.Well get her inside.Wheres Doyle?Something growled, low and deadly.Clear, Bran demanded, waving a hand at the haze.Sawyer drew his weapon again.The wolf stood beside Apollo.The big white dog lay on his side, his fur matted with blood, his breath coming in whines.Doyle stood a foot away, his eyes on the wolf, blood dripping from his raised sword.No!Dont!Sasha started to push forward.Annika broke from Sawyer, and in a limping run rushed toward Doyle.She dived under his sword, threw her arms around the wolf as Sawyer charged after her.Annika!For Christs sake.He would have dragged her clear, but she clung to the wolf, and Sasha moved to push him aside.Stop.Just stop.Its Riley.Shes hurt.And Apollo, too.Crooning, Annika stroked both.Help them.Youve got to be kidding me.Sawyer shoved his gun back in its holster.Rileys a werewolf?She snarled at him, had him backing up one cautious step.Easy, girl.Annika, we need to get you inside, stop that bleeding.Apollo first.Hes innocent.He came to help us, and this isnt his fight.Help him.She turned beseeching eyes to Sawyer.Please.Okay.Sure.Okay.Dont bite me, he said to the wolf.Im just going to see how bad hes hurt.Let me see what I can do right here.Bran crouched down, ran his hands over Apollo.Thats a big secret youve held on to, Dr.Gwin.Its not bad, no, its not bad.He soothed the dog.But even superficial wounds are likely toxic.And that goes for all of us.I have things that will deal with it inside.As he spoke, the last stars faded.The sun shimmered at the edges of the east.The wolf howled, one long note that might have been pain, might have been triumph.And began to change.It hunkered down, muscles and fur quivering.Bones seemed to shift, to twist.Only the eyes remained the same.As the light bloomed, the woman emerged.Riley sat, naked, her arms wrapped around the knees she hugged tight to her chest.Holy shit, and lets add a wow.At Sawyers comment, Riley lifted her head.Not to play shy, but maybe somebody can lend me a shirt.I had to leave my pack in the jeep.Saying nothing, Doyle shrugged out of his coat, tossed it to her.Thanks.Can we save the questions, comments, remarks until we get inside and start triage?Hes not bad, like you said, she told Bran, but hes really hurting.Again keeping his silence, Doyle got his arms under the dog, lifted the considerable weight.Riley managed to get her arms in the sleeves of the coat, wrap it around herself, and, murmuring to Apollo, walked with Doyle.Annika took three limping steps before Sawyer picked her up, carried her.Rileys a freaking werewolf.Lycan, she snapped over her shoulder.Call me a werewolf again and I will bite your ass.Can you walk?Bran asked Sasha.Yes.Im mostly just ...I dont know what.How did you know it was Riley?I just knew.When itshecame out of the dark, I knew.It didnt even surprise methen.Now I just feel numb.As the sun lifted, she, a woman who barely a week before had never held a weapon of any kind, walked back toward the villa holding a knife still wet with blood.FOURTEEN     			Apollo first.Still wearing only Doyles coat, Riley sat on the floor, the dogs head in her lap.Ill need some things, Bran began.I have healing supplies in my room.Ive got a non magickal first aid kit in mine, if it helps.Ill get that as well.Well want plenty of towels, but for now let the wounds bleed.When Bran strode out, everyone began talking at once.Sasha actually felt the words beat like little hammer blows on her temple.Talk later, she snapped, surprising everyone into silence.Doyle, towels.Sawyer, put Annika on the table.As she whipped out orders, she snatched the fruit bowl off the table, then pulled the largest pot out of a cupboard.After she turned on the faucet to fill it, she shoved her hands at her hair, turned.Ah, Sawyer, get Apollos water bowl and a couple of his dog biscuits.If Bran has to medicate him, it should go down easier that way.Check you out, Captain Sasha, Riley commented.Im winging it.She grabbed some towels from Doyle, folded some under Annikas leg to elevate it.And thought, Thank God, when Bran strode back.He nodded when she put the pot of water on to boil.Good thinking.But lets speed it up.At his gesture, the water bubbled.Ten drops each, these three bottles.In this order, he told Sasha.Brown, blue, red.Ten exactly.Can you do that?Yes.He knelt by the dog.Keep him quiet and still, he told Riley, and ran his hands over Apollo.I need to clean his wounds first, counteract any poisons.How did he get out?Busted right through the window of my room.Were going to have to fix that, Riley added with a weak smile.Dont want to lose our security deposit.He gave her arm a pat.Sasha, are you done there?Yes, ten exactly.Brown, blue, red.Step back from the pot now.He held out a hand toward the pot, and his gaze fixed on it.On his murmured incantation, light spewed up from the bubbling water, burst, then circled back down, as liquid circles down a drain.One of the large, clear bottles now.Hold it out.Dont worry.I wont miss.His brew arced out of the pot, arrowed into the bottle.And the next, he told her, and repeated the process.Give one to Sawyer.Youll need to pour it, slowly now, over that gash on her leg.Youll know its done when the blood runs clear.Its going to hurt some, darling, he told Annika.Let me do that.Doyle took the bottle from Sasha.Why dont you hang on to him.With a nod, Annika turned her face into Sawyers chest.Bring me that one, Sasha.Between the two of you, you can keep the dog still and calm.As he worked, Sasha felt Apollos pain, like a slow burn, and his fear of it.He quivered under her hands, turned his head to lap, lap, lap at Riley as if begging her to make it stop.She felt Annikas pain, that shocking rise of heat, a thin line of fire.She felt Sawyers barely suppressed rage, Doyles cold control, Rileys struggle with tears.And Brans utter focus.She felt them all, crowding her, the pain, the grief, the purpose, in a tumult of emotions.She wanted to turn away from them, close off from them.Then Brans hand brushed hers.Nearly done, he said quietly.Nearly there.Can you hold on?She nodded.Tears spilled outRileys tears, she realized, and felt them run down her own cheeks.A second time, Doyle.It wont be as bad now.Cooler now.There now, its cooler, cleaner.What burns washes away, what blackens spills out in light.I dont want to stop, Sasha, but Ill need the bottlethe one you brought me when I needed it.Four drops in water for Annika, then just the bottle here for Apollo.All right?She did as he asked, urged the mixture on Annika.Drink it all now.Its the salve next, isnt it?Thats right.At Brans nod, she took the salve out of Brans box, handed it to Sawyer.Ill need it for Apollo when youre done.How many drops for Apollo?I can put them in his water bowl.Another four.See that he drinks it all, Riley, then coat his wounds with the salve.Hes going to sleep, he added.And sleeping, hell heal.He rose then, moved to Annika.Thats good.See, already healing.Now, where else did they hurt you, darling?Once hed treated her, he turned to Sasha.And you.Lets have a look at you.Some scratches.Just scratches.It was the knife, wasnt it?The knife you gave me.Im pleased it worked.I couldnt be sure, he said as he lifted her arm, began to treat the scratches running down from her shoulder.Sawyer has worse.But you.She looked at Doyle.You dont have any wounds.Just lucky, I guess.No, she thought, there were still secrets here.Rileys are healing on their own.Wounds inflicted when Im in wolf form heal fast.One of the perks.Since Apollo slept, she rose.I know you all have questions, but I need to eat something.The change is like running a marathon at sprint speed; add on the rest, and Im feeling a little shaky.Id say the questions, as therell be many, can wait until weve all cleaned up.Wheres the worst of it, Sawyer?Bran asked him.My back.Riley yanked open the fridge, grabbed a jar of olives as it came first to hand.Im going to catch a quick shower, put some clothes on.By the time theyd mopped up blood, set the kitchen to rights, and Sasha got a shower of her own, she was starving herself.She came down to find Riley and Bran putting breakfast together.Figured this way I can eat as it cooks.Your colors coming back.Sasha went straight to the coffee.Once I filled the hole.Listen, Im sorry.Youre peeved, and I get it, so Im sorry.Sasha only nodded, and took her coffee outside.You make friends easily, dont you?Bran said as he piled the last of the mountain of eggs on the platter.I guess.Shes hasnt, until you.Hell.Take that out; Ill bring the rest.You can explain things while we eat.Since she wasnt at all sure how to explain, Riley filled her plate, shoveled in food until the last of the hunger pangs eased.Maybe you should just ask questions, give me a kind of running start into it.Were you bitten?Sawyer asked her.No.Its hereditary.You come from a family of were Of lycans?Thats right.Let me say right off, we dont eat people.We dont bite them, we dont eat them.Not that there arent some rogues out there, but my packmy familydoesnt hunt, doesnt kill.And were not interested in making more lycans through infection.We make them the old fashioned way.We mate.Do you mate with humans?Annika wondered.You fall for who you fall for, right?So yeah, it happens.Can there be children?Sure.Fifty fifty on lycan traits, so all kids are trained for the change.Initial transformation hits in pubertyas if puberty didnt whack you out enough.Big ceremony, gifts, celebration.Every kid takes an oath, not to hunt, not to kill, not to infect.Any ever break the oath?She looked over at Doyle.Sure.And those who do are punished or banished, depending on the crime and circumstances.Were pack animals.She looked down to where Apollo dozed peacefully beside her chair.Banishment is the worstworse than execution.Were civilized, okay?We have rules, a code.Three nights a month  			Night before the full moon, Sawyer filled in.Night of, night after.Yeah, three nightsexcept in the event of a blue moon, then we get sixwe transform, sundown to sunup.During that time, we fast.And you transforming like you did.Jesus Christ, Riley, I couldve shot you.Sawyer jabbed a finger at her.I nearly did.Unless you loaded with silver bullets, it wouldnt have done much harm.His expression changedreluctant delight.Thats real?Silver bullets?Silver bullets, silver blade.Its going to hurt to get shot or cut otherwise, but its not going to be fatal.You left us.Sasha spoke quietly.Rather than trust us, you lied, and you left.I didnt go far, and I came as soon as I realized what was happening.I couldnt risk staying here.Apollo would have sensed the change coming, for one thing.Hed have smelled the wolf on me.And even if Id locked myself in my room, what if one of you had gotten in?What if youd just told us the truth?Sasha countered.The way I told you the truth?Bran held back at first, and you know how upsetting that was.Weve been together day and night for a week now, we fought together.Twice now.If you couldve gotten clear before sunrise this morning, you would have.Id have tried, Riley agreed.I dont think it wouldve done much good.You knew.You knew before I changed back.That weighs on my side of it.Its part of the oath, Sash.A sacred oath I took at twelve.We dont reveal ourselves, not without permission from the Council of Laws.If you do?Bran asked.The punishment, first offense?Youre locked up for three cycles, no contact.It may not sound like much, but to be chained in wolf form?Its pretty awful.Added to it is the loss of honor and trust.An oath is a holy thing, Annika stated.Yeah, it is.Its a little late for it, but I applied for permission three days ago.Its politics, so there has to be a lot of discussion and debate.I figured Id get it, considering what were doing, but it was going to take a couple weeks to wind its way through the system.Annika reached out.Will they punish you?Not likely.Id applied, and I only broke faith because we were attacked.There are a couple council members who lean pretty hard conservative, but its going to balance out.At worst, theyll postpone sentencing, and if we find the stars, its going to be pretty hard for them to lock up the one who helped find them.Either way, Ill deal with it.You asked for permission to tell us, Sasha repeated.Its a process, believe me.We wouldnt have survived as a species if we didnt hold what is secret and sacred.So sharing what we are needs the process, and more requests are denied than granted.But were different, and what were doing is a heavy weight.Id have had permission before my next cycle.Id have made sure of it, but there wasnt enough time before this one.An oath is a holy thing.Ill accept that.Youre still pissed.Ill get over it.We needed you last night.You came, fought.And we kicked some ass, Sawyer put in.Too easy.Doyle let the words drop, continued eating.Easy?Sawyer scowled down the table.You call that easy?Only one of usand the dogwith serious injuries, and we beat them back in about twenty minutes.He glanced down at Bran.You know it, too.A test, to see what we have, what wed do.Shell come harder next time.Im thinking on it.Youre thinking on it, Sasha muttered, and shoved up from the table.Teamwork.We make placating noises about being a team, but were not.We fought last night, but not really as a unit.You gave me a knife that had some sort of protection, but didnt really explain it.I couldnt be sure it would hold, Bran began.You didnt tell me, she repeated.You didnt tell us what you were doing with the light.You didnt tell us you had power until you had to.Just as Riley didnt tell us what she has.Good reasons for it, of course.Always good reasons.Im sure the rest of you have good reasons for the secrets youre holding.So keep them, thats your choice.But I know we dont have a chance in hell of winning this until we are a unit.So make up your minds, because the next time, those secrets may be the reason she burns right through us.She strode away, up the terrace steps, and shut the doors to her room with a decisive click to give herself what shed always sought.Quiet and solitude.She slept.Shed fought a war, treated the wounded, cleaned up blood, and topped off the morning snarling at her team.So she slept, and woke feeling more restedand just as annoyed.If there were plans to go out diving later, she thought, theyd just have to do without her.She intended to take a walk on the beach, do some sketching, and some hard thinking.She put what she wanted in a tote, stepped outside.Bran stepped out on the terrace seconds after.Im going for a walk, she told him.I need to do the same, to gather more supplies.Would you go with me, help me with that?He stepped toward her.And if you could give me some time after, Id show you how to prepare some of the ingredients.It would be a help to me.Why?Youve done fine on your own.I have, and can.Id do better with your help.You were right, everything you said.I cant speak for the others, but I can promise you, no more secrets between us.It wasnt trust so much, Sasha, as habit.Now Im asking for your help, and doing what I can to get used to the asking.Then it would be bitchy to refuse.I feel like I used up my daily quota of bitchy.You used it well.I need a pouch and a couple of tools.He came back with a pouch slung over his shoulder, and the knife hed given her before, this time in a rough leather sheath.I should have told you how Id empowered it.He snapped it on her belt.Ill tell you now, if she sends a different sort of attack, I cant know if it will hold up the same.If and when, well find out.He took her hand as they started down.Youre not afraid.Theres part of me, inside, still terrified.That part wanted to cut and run screaming this morning.Im not sure what part of me refuses to do thatbut Im trying to get used to it.Wheres everyone else?Rileys sleeping.She got little to none last night, and I think, despite the bravado, shes worried about the ruling of this council of hers.If they rule to punish her for fighting with us, theyll have to get through us to do it.And listen to you.So fierce.Its a waste of time to be mad at her, though I still am, a little.I know about having secrets, but  			You shared yours with her, with me.And we held back.And I understand why.It still stings, but I understand.It might help if I tell you when you left the table Sawyer looked thoughtful and troubled.If theres more to him and his compass, hes struggling over whether to tell us or not.Annika?Theres something deep there.I know shell give us everything she can.Doyle ...Ah, Doyle.Whatever he holds, hell hold tight until hes damn good and ready to loosen it.But I trust him.Why?Hes a warrior at the base, isnt he?Hell fight with his last breath, and defend those who fight beside him.And that includes a dog.He carried Apollo from the field.All right.She sighed.All right, thats a good reason.For now.What are we looking for out here?Certain plants, roots.Well harvest herbs on the way back.Bones would be good if I can find them.Bones?Bird, lizard, small mammals.Natural things that can be used for my purposes.Ill have to send for some of the more complex ingredients, or things that dont grow here, but we can increase my supplies.Here, these poppies to start.He showed her how to harvest plants, roots, leaves.When he identified something unfamiliar to her, she sketched it.Back at the villa he taught her how to use the mortar and pestle, how to jar and label.Its not all a snap of the fingers or flick of the wrist.She noted down the steps for distilling poppy in her sketchbook.Power should come from work, time, effort.Care, he added.As the most important things do.Im used to doing this sort of thing on my own, he admitted.Or with another magician.But youre a quick study, and what you can do here saves some of that time.It matters to me.I see it does.You could show me more.The medicines especially.You and Doyle both think this last attack was a test, and the next will be worse.I do.He held a hand over a small, bubbling cauldron, gauging its progress.I can feel the wounds, if I let myself.But I dont know how to use what you make to treat them.Or not enough.I need to learn more myself, as this has never been my area.Well work on it.Through the thin haze of smoke, he looked at her.Together.He gave her a book on the healing arts.She decided to take an hour by the pool to study it, at least acquaint herself with the basics.She made notes of her own on using comfrey for burns, milk thistle for sprains.How to prepare echinacea for its many uses.She glanced up when she saw Doyle some distance away on the lawn, apparently making something out of ...canvas or burlap.Alone, of course, she thought with a twinge of resentment.She spotted Riley cresting the little rise, coming toward the pool carrying two wide mouthed glasses filled with icy liquid.Magnificent Margaritas, Riley said, and held one out.Thanks.Still mad?Sasha took a sipit was pretty magnificent.Im tired of being mad.Then Im sitting down.Heavy reading, she added with a glance at the thick book with its carved leather binding.Im going to learn how to help Bran treat injuries.You did a lot of that this morning, without the book.I didnt handle myself very well, Riley continued.Changing in front of an audienceand I was a little racked up initially.And Apollo ...Where is he?He went down to the beach with Annika.Hes fine.Like nothing happened.And you?Like I said, if Im injured as the wolf, I heal fast, even after the change.Look, I get a lie of omission is still a lie, but  			You took an oath.I took one to you, too.There it was, Sasha thought.And the rest of her anger cooled knowing her friend understood.Yeah, you did.And now that Im tired of being mad, I can see youd taken steps to keep both, and quickly.It seems like forever, Riley, and its been days.Just days.They wont lock you up.You dont have any say there.Oh, I think I will.She drank again.I think we all will.And theyre just going to have to listen.When did you get to be such a badass?Maybe since Ive stopped asking myself why me.If people think Im weak, if Nerezza thinks I am, its because I have been.She can keep thinking that, it may be an advantage.But no one else is going to.Including me.If it matters, I never thought you were weak.Youre dealing just fine with a real steep learning curve.Lets go back just one month.Did you believe in witches a month ago?I dreamed of oneof himbut no.No, I didnt really believe.In lycans?Absolutely not.Im still working on that one.But here you are, and thats so not weak.Magic compasses, magic spells, transformations.Whatever Annikas got tucked away other than the seventh daughter of a seventh daughters likely to be less of a jolt to me, considering my background and upbringing.You think theres something, too.How can anyone be that happyand theres that sack of coins.Id lean toward faerie, but when I think of faeries, I think cagey.She doesnt come off cagey.Youre going to tell me faeries exist.In my experience, anything that sticks in lore has a basis in fact.Shell probably spill it to Sawyer first.Shes crushing big time there.Then theres the big guy.Riley took a slow sip as she watched Doyle heft something big, thick, and circular.He keeps his mouth shut, a lot, but he listens to everything.Hes holding something back.No question of that.Maybe some variety of demon.Oh, come on.Theyre not all evil spawns of hell, any more than all lycans are man eaters.He likes Bran well enough, and he respects Sawyers eye and aim.Since whatever he is or has or knows, hes a man, too, and he finds Annika charming.He hasnt decided about you and me.I cant argue with any of that.And he doesnt trust any of us through and through.Hed much rather do this alone.Im in absolute agreement there, too, but hes going to have to get over it.And what the hell is he doing?Sasha pushed up then because the only way to know was to find out.Tucking the book under her arm, she started toward him.With a shrug, Riley got up to go with her.He tacked a target to a tree trunk, she saw now, and wondered why someone who favored a sword required target practice.Then he unzipped a case lying on the ground.The crossbow was black and sleek and lethal.Sasha felt a tingle along her skin as Doyle set his foot in the stirrup, cocked it.He flicked a glance in their direction, slung a quiver of bolts over his shoulder.He loaded one, lifted the bow, sighted.The bolt plowed into the target about a quarter inch from dead center bulls eye.Nice.Riley nodded.Stryker, right?The new one.Whats the draw weight?One fifty five.You surprise me, you can draw more than one double nickel.This is my backup.What can you draw?I can draw that.She passed her glass to Sasha, held out her hand.Doyle hesitated, but he handed her the bow.Nice, lightweight.Wont weigh you down on the hunt.As he had, she put a foot in the stirrup and, biceps rippling, cocked the bow.She helped herself to a bolt from his quiver, loaded it.Her shot hit the other side of the bulls eye, about the same distance as his.String suppressors a nice touch.Keeps it quiet.Id say thats, what, about three hundred FPS?Yeah, about.He looked at Sasha now.Bran said you were looking for a crossbow.Yes.I was.You were?You want to learn to shoot, Sash?Id like to try it.Obliging, Riley passed it off to Doyle, took the glasses and the book from Sasha.The draws going to be too much for you.Ive got a cocking device.I need to learn to draw it manually.She took the bow, and turned it as they had, set her foot in the stirrup.But Doyle was right, she didnt have the strength for the draw weight.Ill get stronger.And Bran can do something to make it so I can cock it.Would you do it for me this time?Sure.He did as she asked.You should get used to the weight, the feel.Well move closer to the target.No.From here.He shrugged.Carbon boltno point wasting time with less.You need to make sure its set properly, or  			Let me try it once.She simply took the bolt, loaded it.And in one move aimed, fired.Her bolt centered neatly between theirs, center bulls eye.Well, kick my ass and call me Shirley.Riley gaped at the target, let out a bark of a laugh.That didnt look like beginners luck.Ive used one in dreams.It feels the same.She lowered the bow to study it.I know this.FPS, you said.Thats feet per second.I know this.Doyle walked to the target, pulled out the three bolts.When he walked back, he took the bow, cocked it.Do it again.She hit dead center a second time.No, not luck.Either you beef up, Doyle added, use the cocking deviceor see what Bran can do.You can have that, and a couple dozen bolts.I appreciate the loan.Take care of it.When this is done, give it back.He cocked it yet again, stared off at the target.I figured Id be out here all damn day just showing you how to sight it.Im going for a beer.When he strode off, Riley took a slug of her margarita.I believe you just received the Doyle McCleary Seal of Approval.Better than that.She pinned the next bolt a whisper away from the first.He would have stayed out here all damn day showing me.Are you smelling a little team spirit?I think I am.This time she retrieved the bolts herself.Even that, she realized, felt familiar.Routine.Im not going to use the cocking device.I never used it in the visions.Im going to take this up to Bran, because I think thats how Im able to cock it.Until I get stronger.She began packing the bow and bolts in the case.Where did you go, Riley?When you left yesterday?Not far.I needed to get the jeep out of sight.And get out of sight myself.Getting naked before the change spares the wardrobe.After the sun set, I came back, close enough so Id be around if anything happened.Which it did.You dont need to leave tonight.I guess not, seeing as the wolfs out of the bag.How does it feel, the change?Painful.Powerfulboth ways.Theres a rush.Everything in yous racing.And when the wolfs free, everythings heightened.Smell, sound, sight, speed.But Im still me.Whats human is always in there, the same way the wolf is in me right now.And since Im cut off when the sun sets, Im going to have another margarita.You in?Why not?* * *  			In her cave, Nerezza fashioned a palace.She deserved no less, after all, and surrounded herself with gold and silver, with jewels that sparkled in the light of her torches.She was born to rule, and soon the long wait to do so would be over.Destroying worlds to gain her ends was no matter to her.The stars would provide her with all the power necessary, and when she had them, when she returned to the Island of Glass to ascend the throne, as was her right, she would create whatever she wished.Worlds of fire and storms.Worlds of slaves and suffering.World upon world to do her bidding.This was true rule, and her reign would be endless.In the globe she watched the seer use her foolish weapon.Let them play, she thought, let them savor what they thought a victory, the seer, the she wolf, the witch, and ...She pounded a fist on the golden arm of her throne so the walls of stone shook.Mists swirled around the globe, blocking much from her sight.The sorcerer, she thought.She would deal with him.Oh, she would deal with him.But more, much more enraging, she couldnt see the others for what they were.That was Celenes doingCelene, Luna, Arianrhod.Theyd blocked the knowledge even from the globe.But it would do them no good.Theyd reveal themselves, just as the she wolf had done.And once revealed, the knowledge would show her how to destroy them.When the time came, she thought, and lifted a jeweled mirror to admire herself.She would use them first, let them lead her to the Fire Star.Then she would crush them, take it.
