Noah had said something about missing the view when he started to paddle, but shed shaken her head, saying she was fine the way she was.And it was true.She could see everything she really wanted to see if she turned her head, but most of all she wanted to watch Noah.It was him shed come to see, not the creek.His shirt was unbuttoned at the top, and she could see his chest muscles flex with every stroke.His sleeves were rolled up too, and she could see the well developed muscles in his arms.Artistic, she thought.Theres something almost artistic about him.Something natural, as if being on the water were beyond his control, part of a gene passed on to him from some obscure hereditary pool.She couldnt think of anyone else who remotely resembled him.He was complicated, almost contradictory in so many ways, yet simple, a strangely erotic combination.On the surface he was a country boy, home from war, and he probably saw himself in those terms.Yet there was so much more to him.Perhaps it was the poetry that made him different, or perhaps it was the values his father had instilled in him, growing up.Either way, he seemed to savour life more fully than others appeared to, and that was what had first attracted her to him.What arc you thinking?She felt her insides jump just a hit as Noahs voice brought her back to the present.She realized she hadnt said much since theyd started, and she appreciated the silence he had allowed her.Hed always been considerate like that.Good things, she answered quietly, and she saw in his eyes that he knew she was thinking about him.She liked the fact that he knew it, and she hoped he had been thinking about her as well.She understood then that something was stirring within her, as it had so many years ago.Watching his body move made her feel it.And as their eyes met for a second, she felt the heat in her neck and breasts, and she flushed, turning away before he noticed.How much further?she asked.Another half mile or so.Not any more than that.A pause.Then she said: Tell me, Noah, what do you remember most from the summer we spent together?All of it.Anything in particular?No, he said.You dont remember?He answered quietly.No, its not that.Its not what youre thinking.I was serious when I said all of it.I can remember every moment we were together, and in each of them there was something wonderful.I cant pick any one time that meant more than any other.The entire summer was perfect, the kind of summer everyone should have.How could I pick one moment over another?Poets often describe love as an emotion that we cant control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense.Thats what it was like for me.I didnt plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if you planned on falling in love with me.But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us.We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created.For me, love like that has happened only once, and thats why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory.Ill never forget a single moment of it.Allie stared at him.No one had ever said anything like that to her before.Ever.She didnt know what to say and stayed silent, her face hot.Im sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable, Allie.I didnt mean to.But that summer has stayed with me and probably always will.I know it cant be the same between us, but that doesnt change the way I felt about you then.It didnt make me uncomfortable.Noah Its just that I dont ever hear things like that.What you said was beautiful.It takes a poet to talk the way you do.and like I said, youre the only poet Ive ever met.Peaceful silence descended on them.An osprey cried somewhere in the distance.The paddle moved rhythmically, causing ripples that rocked the boat ever so slightly.The breeze had stopped, and the clouds grew blacker as the canoe moved onwards.Allie noticed it all, every sound, every thought.Her senses had come alive, invigorating her, and she felt strangely satisfied that shed come, pleased that Noah had turned into the type of man shed thought he would, pleased that she would live for ever with that knowledge.She had seen too many men in the past few years destroyed by war, or time, or even money.It took strength to hold on to inner passion, and Noah had done that.This was a workers world, not a poets, and people would have a hard time understanding Noah.Who did she know in Raleigh who took time off to fix a house?Or read Whitman or Eliot?Or hunt at dawn from the bow of a canoe?These werent the things that drove society, but she felt they made living worth while.To her it was the same with art, though she had realized it only upon coming here.Or rather, remembered it.She had known it once before, and again she cursed herself for forgetting something as important as creating beauty.Painting was what she was meant to do, she was sure of that now.She was going to give it another shot, no matter what anyone said.Would Lon encourage her painting?She remembered showing him one of her paintings a couple of months after they had first started going out.It was abstract, meant to inspire thought.Lon had stared at it, and then had asked her what it was supposed to he,  She knew she wasnt being completely fair.She loved Lou, and always had, for other reasons.Lon was a good man, the kind of man shed always known she would marry.With him there would be no surprises, and there was comfort in knowing what the future would bring.He would be a kind husband and she would be a good wife.She would have a home near friends and family, children, a respectable place in society.It was the kind of life shed always expected to live.And though she wouldnt describe theirs as a passionate relationship, she had convinced herself long ago that this wasnt necessary for fulfilment.Passion would fade in time and things like companionship and compatibility would take its place.She and Lon had this, and she had assumed this was all she needed.But now, as she watched Noah rowing, she questioned this assumption.He exuded sexuality in everything he did, everything he was, and she caught herself thinking about him in a way that an engaged woman shouldnt.She tried not to stare, but the easy way he moved his body made it hard to keep her eyes from him for long.Here we are, Noah said as he guided the canoe towards some trees near the bank.Allie looked around, not seeing anything.Where is it?Here, he said again, pointing the canoe at a fallen tree that was almost completely obscuring an opening.He guided the canoe around the tree, and both of them had to lower their heads to keep from bumping them.Close your eyes, he whispered, and Allie did, bringing her hands to her face.She felt the movement of the canoe as he propelled it forwards, away from the pull of the creek.Okay.he finally said after hed stopped paddling.You can open them now.THEY SAT in the middle of a small lake fed by the waters of Brices Creek.It wasnt large, maybe a hundred yards across, and she was surprised at how invisible it had been just moments before.It was spectacular.Tundra swan and Canada geese literally surrounded them.Thousands of them.Birds floating so close together in some places that she couldnt see the water.From a distance, the groups of swans looked almost like icebergs.Oh.Noah, she finally said softly, its beautiful.They sat in silence for a long while, watching the birds.Noah pointed out a group of chicks, recently hatched, following a pack of geese near the shore, struggling to keep up.The air was filled with honking and chirping as Noah moved the canoe through the water.The birds ignored them for the most part.The only ones that seemed bothered were those forced to move when the canoe approached them.Allie reached out to touch the closest ones and felt their feathers ruffling under her fingers.Noah took out the bread hed brought in his bag and handed it to Allie.She scattered it, favouring the little ones, laughing and smiling as they swam in circles looking for food.They stayed until thunder boomed in the distance faint hut powerful and both of them knew it was time to leave.Noah paddled the canoe hack to the main creek.She was still amazed by what she had seen.Noah, what are they doing here?I dont know.I know the swans from up north migrate to Lake Matamuskeet every winter, hut I guess they came here this time.I dont know why.Maybe the early blizzard had something to do with it.Maybe they got off track or something.Theyll find their way back, though.Theyre driven by instinct, and this isnt their place.Some of the geese may winter here, hut the swans will go back to Matamuskeet.Noah paddled hard as dark clouds rolled directly overhead.Soon rain began to fall, a light sprinkle at first, then gradually harder.Lightning a pause then thunder again.A little louder now.Maybe six or seven miles away.More rain as Noah began to paddle even harder, his muscles tightening with every stroke.Thicker drops now, falling hard.Noah rowing getting wet cursing to himself losing to Mother Nature.Allie watched the rain fall diagonally from the sky as it rode on westerly winds that whistled over the trees.The sky darkened a little more.She leaned her head back for a moment to let it hit her face.She ran her hands through her hair, feeling its wetness.It felt wonderful, she felt wonderful.Even through the rain she could hear him breathing hard, and the sound aroused her sexually in a way she hadnt felt in years.A cloud burst directly above them and the rain began to come down harder than shed ever seen it.Allie looked upwards and laughed, giving up any attempt at keeping dry, making Noah feel better.Even though shed made the decision to come, he doubted that shed expected to be caught in a storm like this.They reached the dock a couple of minutes later, and Noah moved in close enough for Allie to step out.He helped her up, then got out himself and dragged the canoe up the bank, tying it to the jetty.As he was tying the canoe, he looked up at Allie and stopped breathing for just a second.She was incredibly beautiful as she waited, watching him.She didnt try to keep dry or hide herself, and he could see the outline of her breasts as they pressed through the fabric of the dress that clung tightly to her body.He quickly turned away, embarrassed.When he finished and stood, Allie took his hands in hers, surprising him.Despite the downpour, they didnt rush towards the house, and Noah imagined what it would be like to spend the night with her.Allie felt the warmth in his hands and wondered what it would be like to have them touch her body, lingering slowly across her skin.Just thinking about it made her take a deep breath.She realized then that something had changed.And although she couldnt pinpoint the exact time yesterday after dinner, or this afternoon in the canoe, or when they saw the swans, or maybe even now as they walked holding hands she knew that she had fallen in love with Noah Taylor Calhoun again, and that maybe, just maybe, she had never stopped.THERE WAS no uneasiness between them as they reached the door and went inside, pausing in the hall, clothes dripping.I think I can find something here for you so you can get out of those clothes.It might be a little big, but its warm.Anything, she said.Ill be back in a second.Noah slipped off his boots, then ran up the stairs, descending a minute later.He had a pair of cotton trousers and a long sleeved shin under one arm and some jeans with a blue shirt in the other.Here, he said, handing her the cotton trousers and shirt.You can change in the bedroom upstairs.Theres a bathroom and towel up there too if you want to shower.She thanked him with a smile and went upstairs, feeling his eyes on her as she walked.She entered the bedroom and closed the door, then set the trousers and shirt on his bed and peeled everything off.Naked, she went to his closet and found a hanger, put her dress, bra and panties on it, and then went to hang it in the bathroom so it wouldnt drip on the hardwood floor.She felt a secret thrill at being naked in the same room he slept in.She didnt want to shower after being in the rain.She liked the soft feeling on her skin.She slipped on his clothes before looking at herself in the mirror.The trousers were big, but tucking in the shin helped, and she rolled up the bottoms just a little so they wouldnt drag.The neck was torn a little, but she liked the way it looked on her anyway.She pulled the sleeves up almost to the elbows, went to the chest of drawers and slipped on some socks, then went to the bathroom to find a hairbrush.She brushed her wet hair just enough to get out the tangles, letting it rest on her shoulders.Looking in the mirror, she wished she had brought a clasp or a couple of hairpins.And a little more mascara.Her eyes still had a little of what shed put on earlier, and she touched up with a flannel, doing the best she could.When she was finished, she checked herself in the mirror, feeling pretty despite everything, and went back downstairs.Noah was in the living room squatting before a fire, doing his best to coax it to life.He didnt see her come in, and she watched him as he worked.He had changed his clothes as well and looked good: his shoulders broad, wet hair hanging just over his collar.He poked the fire, moving the logs, and added some more kindling.Allie leaned against the doorjamb, one leg crossed over the other, and continued to watch him.In a few minutes the fire had turned to flames, even and steady.He turned to the side to straighten the remaining unused logs and caught a glimpse of her out of the corner of his eye.He looked up quickly.Even in his clothes she looked beautiful.After a moment he shyly went back to stacking the logs.I didnt hear you come in.he said, trying to sound casual.How long have you been standing there?A couple of minutes.Noah brushed his hands on his jeans, then pointed to the kitchen.Can I get you some tea?I started the water while you were upstairs.Small talk, anything to keep his mind clear.But damn, the way she looked  She thought for a second.Do you have anything stronger, or is it too early to drink?He smiled.I have some bourbon in the pantry.Is that okay?That sounds great.He started towards the kitchen, and Allie watched him run his hand through his wet hair as he disappeared.Thunder boomed loudly and another downpour started.Allie could hear the roaring of the rain on the roof, could hear the snapping of lop as the flickering flames lit the room.She took a quilt from the sofa and sat on the rug in front of the fire.Crossing her legs, she adjusted the quilt until she was comfortable and watched the dancing flames.Noah came back, saw what she had done, and went to sit beside her.He put down two glasses and poured some bourbon into each of them.Outside, the sky grew darker.Thunder again.Loud.The storm in full fury, winds whipping the rain in circles.Its quite a storm, Noah said as he watched the drops flow in vertical streams on the windows.He and Allie were close now, though not touching, and Noah watched her chest rise slightly with every breath, imagining the feel of her body once again before fighting back the thought  I like it, she said, taking a sip.Ive always liked thunderstorms.Even as a young girl.Why?Saying anything, keeping his balance.I dont know.They just always seemed romantic to me.She was quiet for a moment, and Noah watched the fire flicker in her emerald eyes.Then she said, Do you remember sitting together and watching the storm a few nights before I left?Of course.I used to think about it all the time after I went home.I always thought about how you looked that night.It was the way I remembered you.Have I changed much?She took another sip of bourbon, feeling it warm her.She touched his hand as she answered.Not really.Not in the things that I remember.Youre older, of course, with more life behind you, but youve still got the same gleam in your eye.You still read poetry and float on rivers.And youve still got a gentleness that not even the war could take away.He thought about what shed said and felt her hand lingering on his, her thumb tracing slow circles.Allie, you asked me earlier what I remembered most about the summer.What do you remember?It was a while before she answered."I remember making love.That's what I remember most.You were my first, and it was more wonderful than I ever thought it would be. "Noah took a drink of bourbon, remembering, bringing back the old feelings.She went on."I remember being so afraid beforehand that I was trembling, but at the same time being so excited.I'm glad you were the first.I'm glad we were able to share that. ""Me too. ""Were you as afraid as I was?"Noah nodded without speaking, and she smiled at his honesty.She squeezed his hand, let go, and moved closer.She put her hand through his arm, cradling it, and rested her head on his shoulder.He could smell her, soft like the rain, warm.She spoke quietly."Do you remember walking home after the festival?I asked you if you wanted to see me again.You just nodded your head and didn't say a word.It wasnt too convincing. ""I'd never met anyone like you.I didn't know what to say. ""I know.You could never hide anything.Your eyes always gave you away.You had the most wonderful eyes I'd ever seen. "She lifted her head from his shoulder and looked directly at him.When she spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper."I think I loved you more that summer than I ever loved anyone. "Lightning flashed again.In the quiet moments before the thunder, their eyes met as they tried to undo fourteen years.When the thunder finally sounded, Noah sighed and turned from her, towards the windows."I wish you could have read the letters I wrote you," he said.She didn't speak for a while."It wasn't just up to you, Noah.I didnt tell you, but I wrote you a dozen letters after I got home.I just never sent them. ""Why?"Noah was surprised."I guess I was too afraid. ""Of what?""That maybe it wasnt as real as I thought it was.That maybe you forgot me. ""I would never do that.I couldn't even think it. ""I know that now.I can see it when I took at you.But back then it was different.There was so much I didn't understand, things that a young girl's mind couldn't sort out. ""What do you mean?"When your letters never came, I didn't know what to think.I remember talking to my best friend about that summer, and she said that you had got what you wanted, and that she wasn't surprised that you wouldn't write.I didn't believe that you were that way, I never did, but hearing it and thinking about all our differences made me wonder if maybe the summer meant more to me than it had meant to you  Noah looked away and she continued."In time, the hurt began to fade and it was easier to just let it go.At least I thought it was.But in every boy I met in the next few years I found myself looking for you, and when the feelings got too strong I'd write you another letter.But I never sent them for fear of what I might find.By then you'd gone on with your life and I didn't want to think about you loving someone else.I wanted to remember us like we were that summer. ""You're better than I remembered, Allie. ""You're sweet, Noah. "He almost stopped there, knowing that if he kept the words inside him he could keep control, the same control he had kept the past fourteen years.But then something overtook him and he gave in to it, hoping it would take them back to what they'd had so long ago."I'm not saying it because I'm sweet.I'm saying it because I love you now and I always have.More than you can imagine. "A log snapped, sending sparks up the chimney, and both of them noticed the smouldering remains, almost burned through.
