I walk forward, and I trip, stumbling headlong onto the road.Shit, Ana!Grey cries.He tugs the hand that hes holding so hard that I fall back against him just as a cyclist whips past, narrowly missing me, heading the wrong way up this one way street.It all happens so fast  one minute Im falling, the next Im in his arms, and hes holding me tightly against his chest..I inhale his clean, vital scent.He smells of fresh laundered linen and some expensive body wash.Oh my, its intoxicating.I inhale deeply.Are you okay?he whispers.He has one arm around me, clasping me to him, while the fingers of his other hand softly trace my face, gently probing, examining me.His thumb brushes my lower lip, and I hear his breath hitch.Hes staring into my eyes, and I hold his anxious, burning gaze for a moment or maybe its forever but eventually, my attention is drawn to his beautiful mouth.Oh my.And for the first time in twenty one years, I want to be kissed.I want to feel his mouth on me.Kiss me damn it!I implore him, but I cant move.Im paralyzed with a strange, unfamiliar need, completely captivated by him.Im staring at Christian Greys exquisitely sculptured mouth, mesmerized, and hes looking down at me, his gaze hooded, his eyes darkening.Hes breathing harder than usual, and Ive stopped breathing altogether.Im in your arms.Kiss me, please.He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and gives me a small shake of his head as if in answer to my silent question.When he opens his eyes again, its with some new purpose, a steely resolve.Anastasia, you should steer clear of me.Im not the man for you, he whispers.What?Where is this coming from?Surely I should be the judge of that.I frown up at him, and my head swims with rejection.Breathe, Anastasia, breathe.Im going to stand you up and let you go, he says quietly, and he gently pushes me away.Adrenaline has spiked through my body, from the near miss with the cyclist or the heady proximity to Christian, leaving me wired and weak.NO!My psyche screams as he pulls away, leaving me bereft.He has his hands on my shoulders, holding me at arms length, watching my reactions carefully.And the only thing I can think is that I wanted to be kissed, made it pretty damned obvious, and he didnt do it.He doesnt want me.He really doesnt want me.I have royally screwed up the coffee morning.Ive got this, I breathe, finding my voice.Thank you, I mutter awash with humiliation.How could I have misread the situation between us so utterly?I need to get away from him.For what?he frowns.He hasnt taken his hands off me.For saving me, I whisper.That idiot was riding the wrong way.Im glad I was here.I shudder to think what could have happened to you.Do you want to come and sit down in the hotel for a moment?He releases me, his hands by his sides, and Im standing in front of him feeling like a fool.With a shake, I clear my head.I just want to go.All my vague, unarticulated hopes have been dashed.He doesnt want me.What was I thinking?I scold myself.What would Christian Grey want with you?My subconscious mocks me.I wrap my arms around myself and turn to face the road and note with relief that the green man has appeared.I quickly make my way across, conscious that Grey is behind me.Outside the hotel, I turn briefly to face him but cannot look him in the eye.Thanks for the tea and doing the photo shoot, I murmur.Anastasia I  He stops, and the anguish in his voice demands my attention, so I peer unwillingly up at him.His gray eyes are bleak as he runs his hand through his hair.He looks torn, frustrated, his expression stark, all his careful control has evaporated.What, Christian?I snap irritably after he says  nothing.I just want to go.I need to take my fragile, wounded pride away and somehow nurse it back to health.Good luck with your exams, he murmurs.Huh?This is why he looks so desolate?This is the big send off?Just to wish me luck in my exams?Thanks.I cant disguise the sarcasm in my voice.Goodbye, Mr.Grey.I turn on my heel, vaguely amazed that I dont trip, and without giving him a second glance, I disappear down the sidewalk toward the underground garage.Once underneath the dark, cold concrete of the garage with its bleak fluorescent light, I lean against the wall and put my head in my hands.What was I thinking?Unbidden and unwelcome tears pool in my eyes.Why am I crying?I sink to the ground, angry at myself for this senseless reaction.Drawing up my knees, I fold in on myself.I want to make myself as small as possible.Perhaps this nonsensical pain will be smaller the smaller I am.Placing my head on my knees, I let the irrational tears fall unrestrained.I am crying over the loss of something I never had.How ridiculous.Mourning something that never was   my dashed hopes, dashed dreams, and my soured expectations.I have never been on the receiving end of rejection.Okay so I was always one of the last to be picked for basketball or volleyball  but I understood that  running and doing something else at the same time like bouncing or throwing a ball is not my thing.I am a serious liability in any sporting field.Romantically, though, Ive never put myself out there, ever.A lifetime of insecurity   Im too pale, too skinny, too scruffy, uncoordinated, my long list of faults goes on.So I have always been the one to rebuff any would be admirers.There was that guy in my chemistry class who liked me, but no one has ever sparked my interest  no one except Christian damn Grey.Maybe I should be kinder to the likes of Paul Clayton and Jos Rodriguez, though Im sure neither of them have been found sobbing alone in dark places.Perhaps I just need a good cry.Stop!Stop Now!My subconscious is metaphorically screaming at me, arms folded, leaning on one leg and tapping her foot in frustration.Get in the car, go home, do your studying.Forget about him Now!And stop all this self pitying, wallowing crap.I take a deep, steadying breath and stand up.Get it together Steele.I head for Kates car, wiping the tears off my face as I do.I will not think of him again.I can just chalk this incident up to experience and concentrate on my exams.Kate is sitting at the dining table at her laptop when I arrive.Her welcoming smile fades when she sees me.Ana whats wrong?Oh no not the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition.I shake my head at her in a back off now Kavanagh way  but I might as well be dealing with a blind, deaf mute.Youve been crying, she has an exceptional gift for stating the damned obvious sometimes.What did that bastard do to you?she growls, and her face  jeez, shes scary.Nothing Kate.Thats actually the problem.The thought brings a wry smile to my face.Then why have you been crying?You never cry, she says, her voice softening.She stands, her green eyes brimming with concern.She puts her arms around me and hugs me.I need to say something just to get her to back off.I was nearly knocked over by a cyclist.Its the best that I can do, but it distracts her momentarily from him.Jeez Ana  are you okay?Were you hurt?She holds me at arms length and does a quick visual check up on me.No.Christian saved me, I whisper.But I was quite shaken.Im not surprised.How was coffee?I know you hate coffee.I had tea.It was fine, nothing to report really.I dont know why he asked me.He likes you Ana.She drops her arms.Not anymore.I wont be seeing him again.Yes, I manage to sound matter of fact.Oh?Crap.Shes intrigued.I head into the kitchen so that she cant see my face.Yeah hes a little out of my league Kate, I say as dryly as I can manage.What do you mean?Oh Kate, its obvious.I whirl round and face her as she stands in the kitchen doorway.Not to me, she says.Okay, hes got more money than you, but then he has more money than most people in America!Kate hes  I shrug.Ana!For heavens sake  how many times must I tell you?Youre a total babe, she interrupts me.Oh no.Shes off on this tirade again.Kate, please.I need to study.I cut her short.She frowns.Do you want to see the article?Its finished.Jos took some great pictures.Do I need a visual reminder of the beautiful Christian I dont want you Grey?Sure, I magic a smile on to my face and stroll over to the laptop.And there he is, staring at me in black and white, staring at me and finding me lacking.I pretend to read the article, all the time meeting his steady gray gaze, searching the photo for some clue as to why hes not the man for me  his own words to me.And its suddenly, blindingly obvious.Hes too gloriously good looking.We are poles apart and from two very different worlds.I have a vision of myself as Icarus flying too close to the sun and crashing and burning as a result.His words make sense.Hes not the man for me.This is what he meant, and it makes his rejection easier to accept almost.I can live with this.I understand.Very good Kate, I manage.Im going to study.I am not going to think about him again for now, I vow to myself, and opening my revision notes, I start to read.Its only when Im in bed, trying to sleep, that I allow my thoughts to drift through my strange morning.I keep coming back to the I dont do the girlfriend thing quote, and Im angry that I didnt pounce on this information sooner, when I was in his arms mentally begging him with every fiber of my being to kiss me.Hed said it there and then.He didnt want me as a girlfriend.I turn on to my side.Idly, I wonder if perhaps hes celibate?I close my eyes and begin to drift.Maybe hes saving himself.Well not for you, my sleepy subconscious has a final swipe at me before unleashing itself on my dreams.And that night, I dream of gray eyes, leafy patterns in milk, and Im running through dark places with eerie strip lighting, and I dont know if Im running toward something or away from it its just not clear.I put my pen down.Finished.My final exam is over.I feel the Cheshire cat grin spread over my face.Its probably the first time all week that Ive smiled.Its Friday, and we shall be celebrating tonight, really celebrating.I might even get drunk!Ive never been drunk before.I glance across the sports hall at Kate, and shes still scribbling furiously, five minutes to the end.This is it, the end of my academic career.I shall never have to sit in rows of anxious, isolated students again.Inside Im doing graceful cartwheels around my head, knowing full well thats the only place I can do graceful cartwheels.Kate stops writing and puts her pen down.She glances across at me, and I catch her Cheshire cat smile too.We head back to our apartment together in her Mercedes, refusing to discuss our final paper.Kate is more concerned about what shes going to wear to the bar this evening.I am busily fishing around in my purse for my keys.Ana, theres a package for you.Kate is standing on the steps up to the front door holding a brown paper parcel.Odd.I havent ordered anything from Amazon recently.Kate gives me the parcel and takes my keys to open the front door.Its addressed to Miss Anastasia Steele.Theres no senders address or name.Perhaps its from my mom or Ray.Its probably from my folks.Open it!Kate is excited as she heads into the kitchen for our Exams are finished hurrah Champagne.I open the parcel, and inside I find a half leather box containing three seemingly identi cal old cloth covered books in mint condition and a plain white card.Written on one side, in black ink in neat cursive handwriting, is:  I recognize the quote from Tess.I am stunned by the irony as Ive just spent three hours writing about the novels of Thomas Hardy in my final examination.Perhaps there is no irony perhaps its deliberate.I inspect the books closely, three volumes of Tess of the DUrbervilles.I open the front cover.Written in an old typeface on the front plate is:  London: Jack R.  Osgood, McIlvaine and Co., 1891.Holy shit   they are first editions.They must be worth a fortune, and I know immediately whos sent them.Kate is at my shoulder gazing at the books.She picks up the card.First Editions, I whisper.No.Kates eyes are wide with disbelief.Grey?I nod.Cant think of anyone else.What does this card mean?I have no idea.I think its a warning  honestly he keeps warning me off.I have no idea why.Its not like Im beating his door down.I frown.I know you dont want to talk about him, Ana, but hes seriously into you.Warnings or no.I have not let myself dwell on Christian Grey for the past week.Okay so his gray eyes are still haunting my dreams, and I know it will take an eternity to expunge the feel of his arms around me and his wonderful fragrance from my brain.Why has he sent me this?He told me that I wasnt for him.Ive found one Tess first edition for sale in New York at $14,000.But yours looks in much better condition.They must have cost more.Kate is consulting her good friend Google.This quote  Tess says it to her mother after Alec DUrberville has had his wicked way with her.I know, muses Kate.What is he trying to say?I dont know, and I dont care.I cant accept these from him.Ill send them back with an equally baffling quote from some obscure part of the book.The bit where Angel Clare says fuck off?Kate asks with a completely straight face.Yes, that bit.I giggle.I love Kate, shes so loyal and supportive.I repack the books and leave them on the dining table.Kate hands me a glass of champagne.To the end of exams and our new life in Seattle, she grins.To the end of exams, our new life in Seattle, and excellent results.We clink glasses and drink.The bar is loud and hectic, full of soon to be graduates out to get trashed.Jos joins us.He wont graduate for another year, but hes in the mood to party and gets us into the spirit of our newfound freedom by buying a pitcher of margaritas for us all.As I down my fifth, I know this is not a good idea on top of the champagne.So what now Ana?Jos shouts at me over the noise.Kate and I are moving to Seattle.Kates parents have bought a condo there for her.Dios mio, how the other half live.But youll be back for my show.Of course, Jos, I wouldnt miss it for the world.I smile, and he puts his arm around my waist and pulls me close.It means a lot to me that youll be there Ana, he whispers in my ear.Another margarita?Jos Luis Rodriguez  are you trying to get me drunk?Because I think its working.I giggle.I think Id better have a beer.Ill go get us a pitcher.More drink, Ana!Kate bellows.Kate has the constitution of an ox.Shes got her arm draped over Levi, one of our fellow English students and her usual photographer on her student newspaper.Hes given up taking photos of the drunkenness that surrounds him.He only has eyes for Kate.Shes all tiny camisole, tight jeans, and high heels, hair piled high with tendrils hanging down softly around her face, her usual stunning self.Me, Im more of a Converse and t shirt kind of girl, but Im wearing my most flattering jeans.I move out of Joss hold and get up from our table.Whoa.Head spin.I have to grab the back of the chair.Tequila based cocktails are not a good idea.I make my way to the bar and decide that I should visit the powder room while I am on my feet.Good thinking, Ana.I stagger off through the crowd.Of course, theres a line, but at least its quiet and cool in the corridor.I reach for my cell phone to relieve the boredom of waiting in line.Hmm Who did I last call?Was it Jos?Before that a number I dont recognize.Oh yes.Grey, I think this is his number.I giggle.I have no idea what the time is, maybe Ill wake him.Perhaps he can tell me why he sent me those books and the cryptic message.If he wants me to stay away, he should leave me alone.I suppress a drunken grin and hit the automatic re dial.He answers on the second ring.Anastasia?Hes surprised to hear from me.Well, frankly, Im surprised to ring him.Then my befuddled brain registers how does he know its me?Why did you send me the books?I slur at him.Anastasia, are you okay?You sound strange.His voice is filled with concern.Im not the strange one, you are, I accuse.There   that told him, my courage fuelled by alcohol.Anastasia, have you been drinking?Whats it to you?Im  curious.Where are you?In a bar.Which bar?He sounds exasperated.A bar in Portland.How are you getting home?Ill find a way.This conversation is not going how I expected.Which bar are you in?Why did you send me the books, Christian?Anastasia, where are you, tell me now.His tone is so, so dictatorial, his usual control freak.I imagine him as an old time movie director wearing jodhpurs, holding an old fashioned megaphone and a riding crop.The image makes me laugh out loud.Youre so domineering, I giggle.Ana, so help me, where the fuck are you?Christian Grey is swearing at me.I giggle again.Im in Portland sa long way from Seattle.Where in Portland?Goodnight, Christian.Ana!I hang up.Ha!Though he didnt tell me about the books.I frown.Mission not accomplished.I am really quite drunk   my head swims uncomfortably as I shuffle with the line.Well, the object of the exercise was to get drunk.I have succeeded.This is what its like  probably not an experience to be repeated.The line has moved, and its now my turn.I stare blankly at the poster on the back of the toilet door that extols the virtues of safe sex.Holy crap, did I just call Christian Grey?Shit.My phone rings and it makes me jump.I yelp in surprise.Hi, I bleat timidly in to the phone.I hadnt reckoned on this.Im coming to get you, he says and hangs up.Only Christian Grey could sound so calm and so threatening at the same time.Holy crap.I pull my jeans up.My heart is thumping.Coming to get me?Oh no.Im going to be sick no Im fine.Hang on.Hes just messing with my head.I didnt tell him where I was.He cant find me here.Besides, it will take him hours to get here from Seattle, and well be long gone by then.I wash my hands and check my face in the mirror.I look flushed and slightly unfocused.Hmm tequila.I wait at the bar for what feels like an eternity for the pitcher of beer and eventually return to the table.Youve been gone so long.Kate scolds me.Where were you?I was in line for the restroom.Jos and Levi are having some heated debate about our local baseball team.Jos pauses in his tirade to pour us all beers, and I take a long sip.Kate, I think Id better step outside and get some fresh air.Ana, you are such a lightweight.Ill be five minutes.I make my way through the crowd again.I am beginning to feel nauseous, my head is spinning uncomfortably, and Im a little unsteady on my feet.More unsteady than usual.Drinking in the cool evening air in the parking lot makes me realize how drunk I am.My vision has been affected, and Im really seeing double of everything like in old re runs of Tom and Jerry Cartoons.I think Im going to be sick.Why did I let myself get this messed up?Ana, Jos has joined me.You okay?I think Ive just had a bit too much to drink.I smile weakly at him.Me too, he murmurs, and his dark eyes are watching me intently.Do you need a hand?he asks and steps closer, putting his arm around me.Jos Im okay.Ive got this.I try and push him away rather feebly.Ana, please, he whispers, and now hes holding me in his arms, pulling me close.Jos, what you doing?You know I like you Ana, please.He has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him, the other at my chin tipping back my head.Holy fuck hes going to kiss me.No Jos, stop  no.I push him, but hes a wall of hard muscle, and I cannot shift him.His hand has slipped into my hair, and hes holding my head in place.Please, Ana, caria, he whispers against my lips.His breath is soft and smells too sweet  of margarita and beer.He gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth.I feel panicky, drunk, and out of control.The feeling is suffocating.Jos, no, I plead.I dont want this.You are my friend, and I think Im going to throw up.I think the lady said no.A voice in the dark says quietly.Holy shit!Christian Grey, hes here.How?Jos releases me.Grey, he says tersely.I glance anxiously up at Christian.Hes glowering at Jos, and hes furious.Crap.My stomach heaves, and I double over, my body no longer able to tolerate the alcohol, and I vomit spectacularly on to the ground.Ugh  Dios mio, Ana!Jos jumps back in disgust.Grey grabs my hair and pulls it out of the firing line and gently leads me over to a raised flowerbed on the edge of the parking lot.I note, with deep gratitude, that its in relative darkness.If youre going to throw up again, do it here.Ill hold you.He has one arm around my shoulders  the other is holding my hair in a makeshift ponytail down my back so its off my face.I try awkwardly to push him away, but I vomit again and again.Oh shit  how long is this going to last?Even when my stomachs empty and nothing is coming up, horrible dry heaves wrack my body.I vow silently that Ill never ever drink again.This is just too appalling for words.Finally, it stops.My hands are resting on the brick wall of the flowerbed, barely holding me up   vomiting profusely is exhausting.Grey takes his hands off me and passes me a handkerchief.Only he would have a monogrammed, freshly laundered, linen handkerchief.CTG.I didnt know you could still buy these.Vaguely I wonder what the T stands for as I wipe my mouth.I cannot bring myself to look at him.Im swamped with shame, disgusted with myself.I want to be swallowed up by the azaleas in the flowerbed and be anywhere but here.Jos is still hovering by the entrance to the bar, watching us.I groan and put my head in my hands.This has to be the single worst moment of my life.My head is still swimming as I try to remember a worse one  and I can only come up with Christians rejection  and this is so, so many shades darker in terms of humiliation.I risk a peek at him.Hes staring down at me, his face composed, giving nothing away.Turning, I glance at Jos who looks pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by Grey.I glare at him.I have a few choice words for my so called friend, none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey CEO.Ana who are you kidding, hes just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora.Theres no disguising your lack of ladylike behavior.Ill err see you inside, Jos mutters, but we both ignore him, and he slinks off back into the building.Im on my own with Grey.Double crap.What should I say to him?Apologize for the phone call.Im sorry, I mutter, staring at the handkerchief which I am furiously worrying with my fingers.Its so soft.What are you sorry for Anastasia?Oh crap, he wants his damned pound of flesh.The phone call mainly, being sick.Oh, the list is endless, I murmur, feeling my skin coloring up.Please, please can I die now?Weve all been here, perhaps not quite as dramatically as you, he says dryly.Its about knowing your limits, Anastasia.I mean, Im all for pushing limits, but really this is beyond the pale.Do you make a habit of this kind of behavior?My head buzzes with excess alcohol and irritation.What the hell has it got to do with him?I didnt invite him here.He sounds like a middle aged man scolding me like an errant child.Part of me wants to say, if I want to get drunk every night like this, then its my decision and nothing to do with him  but Im not brave enough.Not now that Ive thrown up in front of him.Why is he still standing there?No, I say contritely.Ive never been drunk before and right now I have no desire to ever be again.I just dont understand why hes here.I begin to feel faint.He notices my dizziness and grabs me before I fall and hoists me into his arms, holding me close to his chest like a child.Come on, Ill take you home, he murmurs.I need to tell Kate.Holy Moses, Im in his arms again.My brother can tell her.What?My brother Elliot is talking to Miss Kavanagh.Oh?I dont understand.He was with me when you phoned.In Seattle?Im confused.No, Im staying at the Heathman.Still?Why?How did you find me?I tracked your cell phone Anastasia.Oh, of course he did.How is that possible?Is it legal?Stalker, my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila thats still floating in my brain, but somehow, because its him, I dont mind.Do you have a jacket or a purse?Err yes, I came with both.Christian, please, I need to tell Kate.Shell worry.His mouth presses into a hard line, and he sighs heavily.If you must.He sets me down, and, taking my hand, leads me back into the bar.I feel weak, still drunk, embarrassed, exhausted, mortified, and on some strange level absolutely off the scale thrilled.Hes clutching my hand  such a confusing array of emotions.Ill need at least a week to process them all.Its noisy, crowded, and the music has started so there is a large crowd on the dance floor.Kate is not at our table, and Jos has disappeared.Levi looks lost and forlorn on his own.Wheres Kate?I shout at Levi above the noise.My head is beginning to pound in time to the thumping bass line of the music.Dancing, Levi shouts, and I can tell hes mad.Hes eyeing Christian suspiciously.I struggle into my black jacket and place my small shoulder bag over my head so it sits at my hip.Im ready to go, once Ive seen Kate.Shes on the dance floor, I touch Christians arm and lean up and shout in his ear, brushing his hair with my nose, smelling his clean, fresh smell.Oh my.All those forbidden, unfamiliar feelings that I have tried to deny surface and run amok through my drained body.I flush, and somewhere deep, deep down my muscles clench deliciously.He rolls his eyes at me and takes my hand again and leads me to the bar.Hes served immediately, no waiting for Mr.Control Freak Grey.Does everything come so easily to him?I cant hear what he orders.He hands me a very large glass of iced water.Drink, he shouts his order at me.The moving lights are twisting and turning in time to the music casting strange colored light and shadows all over the bar and the clientele.Hes alternately green, blue, white, and a demonic red.Hes watching me intently.I take a tentative sip.All of it, he shouts.Hes so overbearing.He runs his hand through his unruly hair.He looks frustrated, angry.What is his problem?Apart from a silly drunk girl ringing him in the middle of the night so he thinks she needs rescuing.And it turns out she does from her over amorous friend.Then seeing her being violently ill at his feet.Oh Ana are you ever going to live this down?My subconscious is figuratively tutting and glaring at me over her half moon specs.I sway slightly, and he puts his hand on my shoulder to steady me.I do as Im told and drink the entire glass.It makes me feel queasy.Taking the glass from me, he places it on the bar.I notice through a blur what hes wearing; a loose white linen shirt, snug jeans, black Converse sneakers, and a dark pinstriped jacket.His shirt is unbuttoned at the top, and I see a sprinkling of hair in the gap.In my groggy frame of mind, he looks yummy.He takes my hand once more.Holy cow  hes leading me onto the dance floor.Shit.I do not dance.He can sense my reluctance, and under the colored lights, I can see his amused, slightly sardonic smile.He gives my hand a sharp tug, and Im in his arms again, and he starts to move, taking me with him.Boy, he can dance, and I cant believe that Im following him step for step.Maybe its because Im drunk that I can keep up.Hes holding me tight against him, his body against mine if he wasnt clutching me so tightly, Im sure I would swoon at his feet.In the back of my mind, my mothers often recited warning comes to me: Never trust a man who can dance.He moves us through the crowded throng of dancers to the other side of the dance floor, and we are beside Kate and Elliot, Christians brother.The music is pounding away, loud and leery, outside and inside my head.I gasp.Kate is making her moves.Shes dancing her ass off, and she only ever does that if she likes someone.Really likes someone.It means therell be three of us for breakfast tomorrow morning.Kate!Christian leans over and shouts in Elliots ear.I cannot hear what he says.Elliot is tall with wide shoulders, curly blonde hair, and light, wickedly gleaming eyes.I cant tell the color under the pulsating heat of the flashing lights.Elliot grins, and pulls Kate into his arms, where she is more than happy to be Kate!Even in my inebriated state, I am shocked.Shes only just met him.She nods at whatever Elliot says and grins at me and waves.Christian propels us off the dance floor in double quick time.But I never got to talk to her.Is she okay?I can see where things are heading for her and him.I need to do the safe sex lecture.In the back of my mind, I hope she reads one of the posters on the back of the toilet doors.My thoughts crash through my brain, fighting the drunk, fuzzy feeling.Its so warm in here, so loud, so colorful  too bright.My head begins to swim, oh no and I can feel the floor coming up to meet my face or so it feels.The last thing I hear before I pass out in Christian Greys arms is his harsh epithet.Fuck!Its very quiet.The light is muted.I am comfortable and warm, in this bed.Hmm I open my eyes, and for a moment, Im tranquil and serene, enjoying the strange unfamiliar surroundings.I have no idea where I am.The headboard behind me is in the shape of a massive sun.Its oddly familiar.The room is large and airy and plushly furnished in browns and golds and beige.I have seen it before.Where?My befuddled brain struggles through its recent visual memories.Holy crap.Im in the Heathman hotel in a suite.I have stood in a room similar to this with Kate.This looks bigger.Oh shit.Im in Christian Greys suite.How did I get here?Fractured memories of the previous night come slowly back to haunt me.The drinking, oh no the drinking, the phone call, oh no the phone call, the vomiting, oh no the vomiting.Jos and then Christian.Oh no.I cringe inwardly.I dont remember coming here.Im wearing my t shirt, bra, and panties.No socks.No jeans.Holy shit.I glance at the bedside table.On it is a glass of orange juice and two tablets.Advil.Control freak that he is, he thinks of everything.I sit up and take the tablets.Actually, I dont feel that bad, probably much better than I deserve.The orange juice tastes divine.Its thirst quenching and refreshing.Nothing beats freshly squeezed orange juice for reviv ing an arid mouth.Theres a knock on the door.My heart leaps into my mouth, and I cant seem to find my voice.He opens the door anyway and strolls in.Holy hell, hes been working out.Hes in gray sweat pants that hang, in that way, off his hips and a gray singlet, which is dark with sweat, like his hair.Christian Greys sweat, the notion does odd things to me.I take a deep breath and close my eyes.I feel like a two year old, if I close my eyes then Im not really here.Good morning Anastasia.How are you feeling?Oh no.Better than I deserve, I mumble.I peek up at him.He places a large shopping bag on a chair and grasps each end of the towel that he has around his neck.Hes staring at me, gray eyes dark, and as usual, I have no idea what hes thinking.He hides his thoughts and feelings so well.How did I get here?My voice is small, contrite.He comes and sits down on the edge of the bed.Hes close enough for me to touch, for me to smell.Oh my sweat and body wash and Christian, its a heady cocktail   so much better than a margarita, and now I can speak from experience.After you passed out, I didnt want to risk the leather upholstery in my car taking you all the way to your apartment.So I brought you here, he says phlegmatically.Did you put me to bed?Yes.His face is impassive.Did I throw up again?My voice is quieter.No.Did you undress me?I whisper.Yes.He quirks an eyebrow at me as I blush furiously.We didnt, I whisper, my mouth drying in mortified horror as I cant complete the question.I stare at my hands.Anastasia, you were comatose.Necrophilia is not my thing.I like my women sentient and receptive, he says dryly.Im so sorry.His mouth lifts slightly in a wry smile.It was a very diverting evening.Not one that Ill forget in a while.Me neither  oh hes laughing at me, the bastard.I didnt ask him to come and get me.Somehow Ive been made to feel like the villain of the piece.You didnt have to track me down with whatever James Bond stuff youre developing for the highest bidder, I snap at him.He stares at me, surprised, and if Im not mistaken, a little wounded.Firstly, the technology to track cell phones is available over the Internet.Secondly, my company does not invest or manufacture any kind of surveillance devices, and thirdly, if I hadnt come to get you, youd probably be waking up in the photographers bed, and from what I can remember, you werent overly enthused about him pressing his suit, he says acidly.Pressing his suit!I glance up at Christian, hes glaring at me, his gray eyes blazing, aggrieved.I try to bite my lip, but I fail to repress my laughter.Which medieval chronicle did you escape from?I giggle.You sound like a courtly knight.His mood visibly shifts.His eyes soften and his expression warms, and I see a trace of a smile on his beautifully chiseled lips.Anastasia, I dont think so.Dark knight maybe.His smile is sardonic, and he shakes his head.Did you eat last night?His tone is accusatory.I shake my head.What major transgression have I committed now?His jaw clenches, but his face remains impassive.You need to eat.Thats why you were so ill.Honestly Anastasia, its drinking rule number one.He runs this hand through his hair, and I know its because hes exasperated.Are you going to continue to scold me?Is that what Im doing?I think so.Youre lucky Im just scolding you.What do you mean?Well, if you were mine, you wouldnt be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday.You didnt eat, you got drunk, you put yourself at risk.He closes his eyes, dread etched on his lovely face, and he shudders slightly.When he opens his eyes, he glares at me.I hate to think what could have happened to you.I scowl back at him.What is his problem?Whats it to him?If I was his well Im not.Though maybe, part of me would like to be.The thought pierces through the irritation I feel at his high handed words.I flush at the waywardness of my subconscious   shes doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.I would have been fine.I was with Kate.And the photographer?he snaps at me.Hmm young Jos.Ill need to face him at some point.Jos just got out of line.I shrug.Well the next time he gets out of line, maybe someone should teach him some manners.You are quite the disciplinarian, I hiss at him.Oh, Anastasia, you have no idea.His eyes narrow, and then he grins wickedly.Its disarming.One minute, Im confused and angry, the next Im gazing at his gorgeous smile.Wow I am entranced, and its because his smile is so rare.I quite forget what hes talking about.Im going to have a shower.Unless youd like to shower first?He cocks his head to one side, still grinning.My heartbeat has picked up, and my medulla oblongata has neglected to fire any synapses to make me breathe.His grin widens, and he reaches over and runs his thumb down my cheek and across my lower lip.Breathe, Anastasia, he whispers and rises.Breakfast will be here in fifteen minutes.You must be famished.He heads into the bathroom and closes the door.I let out the breath that Ive been holding.Why is he so damned attractive?Right now I want to go and join him in the shower.I have never felt this way about anyone.My hormones are racing.My skin tingles where his thumb traced over my face and lower lip.I feel like squirming with a needy, achy discomfort.I dont understand this reaction.Hmm Desire.This is desire.This is what it feels like.I lie back on the soft feather filled pillows.If you were mine.Oh my  what would I do to be his?Hes the only man who has ever set my blood racing around my body.Yet, hes so antagonizing too; hes difficult, complicated, and confusing.One minute he rebuffs me, the next he sends me fourteen thousand dollar books, then he tracks me like a stalker.And for all that, I have spent the night in his hotel suite, and I feel safe.Protected.He cares enough to come and rescue me from some mistakenly perceived danger.Hes not a dark knight at all, but a white knight in shining, dazzling armor  a classic romantic hero  Sir Gawain or Lancelot.I scramble out of his bed frantically searching for my jeans.He emerges from the bathroom wet and glistening from the shower, still unshaven, with just a towel around his waist, and there am I  all bare legs and awkward gawkiness.Hes surprised to see me out of bed.If youre looking for your jeans, Ive sent them to the laundry.His gaze is a dark obsidian.They were spattered with your vomit.Oh.I flush scarlet.Why oh why does he always catch me on the back foot?I sent Taylor out for another pair and some shoes.Theyre in the bag on the chair.Clean clothes.What an unexpected bonus.Um Ill have a shower, I mutter.Thanks.What else can I say?I grab the bag and dart into the bathroom away from the unnerving proximity of naked Christian.Michel angelos David has nothing on him.In the bathroom, its all hot and steamy from where hes been showering.I strip off my clothes and quickly clamber into the shower anxious to be under the cleansing stream of water.It cascades over me, and I hold up my face into the welcoming torrent.I want Christian Grey.I want him badly.Simple fact.For the first time in my life, I want to go to bed with a man.I want to feel his hands and his mouth on me.He said he likes his women sentient.Hes probably not celibate then.But hes not made a pass at me, unlike Paul or Jos.I dont understand.Does he want me?He wouldnt kiss me last week.Am I repellent to him?And yet, Im here and he brought me here.I just dont know what his game is?What hes thinking?Youve slept in his bed all night, and hes not touched you Ana.You do the math.My subconscious has reared her ugly, snide head.I ignore her.The water is warm and soothing.Hmm I could stay under this shower, in his bathroom, forever.I reach for the body wash and it smells of him.Its a delicious smell.I rub it all over myself, fantasizing that its him   him rubbing this heavenly scented soap into my body, across my breasts, over my stomach, between my thighs with his long fingered hands.Oh my.My heartbeat picks up again, this feels so so good.Breakfast is here.He knocks on the door, startling me.Okay, I stutter as Im yanked cruelly out of my erotic daydream.I climb out of the shower and grab two towels.I put my hair in one and wrap it Carmen Miranda style on my head.Hastily, I dry myself, ignoring the pleasurable feel of the towel rubbing against my over sensitized skin.I inspect the bag of jeans.Not only has Taylor brought me jeans and new Converse, but a pale blue shirt, socks, and underwear.Oh my.A clean bra and panties  actually to describe them in such a mundane, utilitarian way does not do them justice.They are an exquisite design of some fancy European lingerie.All pale blue lace and finery.Wow.I am in awe and slightly daunted by this underwear..Whats more, they fit perfectly.But of course they do.I flush to think of the Buzz Cut man in some lingerie store buying this for me.I wonder what else is in his job description.I dress quickly.The rest of the clothing is a perfect fit.I brusquely towel dry my hair and try desperately to bring it under control.But, as usual, it refuses to cooperate, and my only option is to restrain it with a hair tie.I shall search in my purse, when I find it.I take a deep breath.Time to face Mr.Confusing.Im relieved to find the bedroom empty.I hunt quickly for my purse  but its not in here.Taking another deep breath, I enter the living area of the suite.Its huge.Theres an opulent, plush seating area, all overstuffed couches and soft cushions, an elaborate coffee table with a stack of large glossy books, a study area with a top of the range Mac, an enormous plasma screen TV on the wall, and Christian is sitting at a dining table on the other side of the room reading a newspaper.Its the size of a tennis court or something, not that I play tennis, though I have watched Kate a few times.Kate!Crap, Kate, I croak.Christian peers up at me.She knows youre here and still alive.I texted Elliot, he says with just a trace of humor.Oh no.I remember her fervent dancing of the night before.All her patented moves used with maximum effect to seduce Christians brother no less!Whats she going to think about me being here?Ive never stayed out before.Shes still with Elliot.Shes only done this twice before, and both times Ive had to endure the hideous pink PJs for a week from the fallout.Shes going to think Ive had a one night stand too.Christian stares at me imperiously.Hes wearing a white linen shirt, collar and cuffs undone.Sit, he commands, pointing to a place at the table.I make my way across the room and sit down opposite him as Ive been directed.The table is laden with food.I didnt know what you liked, so I ordered a selection from the breakfast menu.He gives me a crooked, apologetic smile.Thats very profligate of you, I murmur, bewildered by the choice, though I am hungry.Yes, it is.He sounds guilty.I opt for pancakes, maple syrup, scrambled eggs, and bacon.Christian tries to hide a smile as he returns to his egg white omelet.The food is delicious.Tea?he asks.Yes, please.He passes me a small teapot of hot water and on the saucer is a Twinings English Breakfast teabag.Jeez, he remembers how I like my tea.Your hairs very damp, he scolds.I couldnt find the hairdryer, I mutter, embarrassed.Not that I looked.Christians mouth presses into a hard line, but he doesnt say anything.Thank you for organizing the clothes.Its a pleasure, Anastasia.That color suits you.I blush and stare down at my fingers.You know, you really should learn to take a compliment.His tone is castigating.I should give you some money for these clothes.He glares at me as if I have offended him on some level.I hurry on.Youve already given me the books, which, of course, I cant accept.But these clothes, please let me pay you back.I smile tentatively at him.Anastasia, trust me, I can afford it.Thats not the point.Why should you buy these for me?Because I can, his eyes flash with a wicked gleam.Just because you can doesnt mean that you should, I reply quietly as he arches an eyebrow at me, his eyes twinkling, and suddenly I feel that were talking about something else, but I dont know what it is.Which reminds me  Why did you send me the books, Christian?My voice is soft.He puts down his cutlery and regards me intently, his gray eyes burning with some unfathomable emotion.Holy crap  my mouth dries.Well, when you were nearly run over by the cyclist  and I was holding you and you were looking up at me  all kiss me, kiss me, Christian, he pauses and shrugs slightly, I felt I owed you an apology and a warning.He runs his hand through his hair.Anastasia, Im not a hearts and flowers kind of man, I dont do romance.My tastes are very singular.You should steer clear from me.He closes his eyes as if in defeat.Theres something about you, though, and Im finding it impossible to stay away.But I think youve figured that out already.My appetite vanishes.He cant stay away!Then dont, I whisper.He gasps, his eyes wide.You dont know what youre saying.Enlighten me, then.We sit gazing at each other, neither of us touching our food.Youre not celibate then?I breathe.Amusement lights up his gray eyes.No, Anastasia, Im not celibate.He pauses for this information to sink in, and I flush scarlet.The mouth to brain filter is broken again.I cant believe Ive just said that out loud.What are your plans for the next few days?he asks, his voice low.Im working today, from midday.What is the time?I panic suddenly.Its just after ten, youve plenty of time.What about tomorrow?He has his elbows on the table, and his chin is resting on his long steepled fingers.Kate and I are going to start packing.Were moving to Seattle next weekend, and Im working at Claytons all this week.You have a place in Seattle already?Yes.Where?I cant remember the address.Its in the Pike Market District.Not far from me, his lips twitch up in a half smile.So what are you going to do for work in Seattle?Where is he going with all these questions?The Christian Grey Inquisition is almost as irritating as the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition.Ive applied for some internships.Im waiting to hear.Have you applied to my company as I suggested?I flush of course not.Um no.And whats wrong with my company?Your company or your Company?I smirk.He smiles slightly.Are you smirking at me, Miss Steele?He cocks his head to one side, and I think he looks amused, but its hard to tell.I flush and glance down at my unfinished breakfast.I cant look him in the eye when he uses that tone of voice.Id like to bite that lip, he whispers darkly.Oh my.I am completely unaware that I am chewing my bottom lip.My mouth pops open as I gasp and swallow at the same time.That has to be the sexiest thing anybody has ever said to me.My heart beat spikes, and I think Im panting.Jeez, Im a quivering, moist mess, and he hasnt even touched me.I squirm in my seat and meet his dark glare.Why dont you?I challenge quietly.Because Im not going to touch you Anastasia   not until I have your written consent to do so.His lips hint at a smile.What?What does that mean?Exactly what I say.He sighs and shakes his head at me, amused, but exasperated too.I need to show you, Anastasia.What time do you finish work this evening?About eight.Well, we could go to Seattle this evening or next Saturday for dinner at my place, and Ill acquaint you with the facts then.The choice is yours.Why cant you tell me now?I sound petulant.Because Im enjoying my breakfast and your company.Once youre enlightened, you probably wont want to see me again.Holy shit.What does that mean?Does he white slave small children to some God forsaken part of the planet?Is he part of some underworld crime syndicate?It would explain why hes so rich.Is he deeply religious?Is he impotent?Surely not, he could prove that to me right now.Oh my.I flush scarlet thinking about the possibilities.This is getting me nowhere.Id like to solve the riddle that is Christian Grey sooner rather than later.If it means that whatever secret he has is so gross that I dont want to know him any more then, quite frankly, it will be a relief.Dont lie to yourself  my subconscious yells at me itll have to be pretty bloody bad to have you running for the hills.Tonight.He raises an eyebrow.Like Eve, youre so quick to eat from the tree of knowledge, he smirks.Are you smirking at me, Mr.Grey?I ask sweetly.Pompous ass.He narrows his eyes at me and picks up his BlackBerry.He presses one number.Taylor.Im going to need Charlie Tango.Charlie Tango!Whos he?From Portland at say twenty thirty...No, standby at Escala All night.All night!Yes.On call tomorrow morning.Ill pilot from Portland to Seattle.Pilot?Standby pilot from twenty two thirty.He puts the phone down.No please or thank you.Do people always do what you tell them?Usually, if they want to keep their jobs, he says, deadpan.And if they dont work for you?Oh, I can be very persuasive, Anastasia.You should finish your breakfast.And then Ill drop you home.Ill pick you up at Claytons at eight when you finish.Well fly up to Seattle.I blink at him rapidly.Fly?Yes.I have a helicopter.I gape at him.I have my second date with Christian oh so mysterious Grey.From coffee to helicopter rides.Wow.Well go by helicopter to Seattle?Yes.Why?He grins wickedly.Because I can.Finish your breakfast.How can I eat now?Im going to Seattle by helicopter with Christian Grey.And he wants to bite my lip I squirm at the thought  Eat, he says more sharply.Anastasia, I have an issue with wasted food eat.I cant eat all this.I gape at whats left on the table.Eat whats on your plate.If youd eaten properly yesterday, you wouldnt be here, and I wouldnt be declaring my hand so soon.His mouth sets in a grim line.He looks angry.I frown and return to my now cold food.Im too excited to eat, Christian.Dont you understand?My subconscious explains.But Im too much of a coward to voice these thoughts aloud, especially when he looks so sullen.Hmm, like a small boy.I find the thought amusing.Whats so funny?he asks.I shake my head, not daring tell him and keep my eyes on my food.Swallowing my last piece of pancake, I peek up at him.Hes eyeing me speculatively.Good girl, he says.Ill take you home when youve dried your hair.I dont want you getting ill.Theres some kind of unspoken promise in his words.What does he mean?I leave the table, wondering for a moment if I should ask permission but dismissing the idea.Sounds like a dangerous precedent to set.I head back to his bedroom.A thought stops me.Where did you sleep last night?I turn to gaze at him still sitting in the dining room chair.I cant see any blankets or sheets out here  perhaps hes had them tidied away.In my bed, he says simply, his gaze impassive again.Oh.Yes, it was quite a novelty for me too.He smiles.Not having sex.There  I said the word.I blush  of course.No, he shakes his head and frowns as if recalling something uncomfortable.Sleeping with someone.He picks up his newspaper and continues to read.What in heavens name does that mean?Hes never slept with anyone?Hes a virgin?Somehow I doubt that.I stand staring at him in disbelief.He is the most mystifying person Ive ever met.And it dawns on me that I have slept with Christian Grey, and I kick myself  what would I have given to be conscious to watch him sleep.See him vulnerable.Somehow, I find that hard to imagine.Well, allegedly all will be revealed tonight.In his bedroom, I hunt through a chest of drawers and find the hair dryer.Using my fingers, I dry my hair the best I can.When Ive finished, I head into the bathroom.I want to clean my teeth.I eye Christians toothbrush.It would be like having him in my mouth.Hmm Glancing guiltily over my shoulder at the door, I feel the bristles on the toothbrush.They are damp.He must have used it already.Grabbing it quickly, I squirt toothpaste on it and brush my teeth in double quick time.I feel so naughty.Its such a thrill.Grabbing my t shirt, bra, and panties from yesterday, I put them in the shopping bag that Taylor brought and head back to the living area to hunt for my bag and jacket.Deep joy, there is a hair tie in my bag.Christian is watching me as I tie my hair into a ponytail, his expression unreadable.I feel his eyes follow me as I sit down and wait for him to finish.Hes on his BlackBerry talking to someone.They want two?How much will that cost?...Okay, and what safety measures do we have in place?And theyll go via Suez?How safe is Ben Sudan?...And when do they arrive in Darfur?...Okay, lets do it.Keep me abreast of progress.He hangs up.Ready to go?I nod.I wonder what his conversation was about.He slips on a navy pinstriped jacket, picks up his car keys, and heads for the door.After you, Miss Steele, he murmurs, opening the door for me.He looks so casually elegant.I pause, fractionally too long, drinking in the sight of him.And to think I slept with him last night and, after all the tequila and the throwing up, hes still here.Whats more, he wants to take me to Seattle.Why me?I dont understand it.I head out the door recalling his words  Theres something about you  Well the feeling is entirely mutual Mr.Grey, and I aim to find out what it is.We walk in silence down the corridor toward the elevator.As we wait, I peek up at him through my lashes, and he looks out of the corner of his eyes down at me.I smile, and his lips twitch.The elevator arrives, and we step in.Were alone.Suddenly, for some inexplicable reason, possibly our proximity in such an enclosed space, the atmosphere between us changes, charging with an electric, exhilarating anticipation.My breathing alters as my heart races.His head turns fractionally toward me, his eyes darkest slate.I bite my lip.Oh, fuck the paperwork, he growls.He lunges at me, pushing me against the wall of the elevator.Before I know it, hes got both of my hands in one of his in a vice like grip above my head, and hes pinning me to the wall using his hips.Holy shit.His other hand grabs my ponytail and yanks down, bringing my face up, and his lips are on mine.Its only just not painful.I moan into his mouth, giving his tongue an opening.He takes full advantage, his tongue expertly exploring my mouth.I have never been kissed like this.My tongue tentatively strokes his and joins his in a slow erotic dance thats all about touch and sensation, all bump and grind.He brings his hand up to grasp my chin and holds me in place.I am helpless, my hands pinned, my face held, and his hips restraining me..I feel his erection against my belly.Oh my He wants me.Christian Grey, Greek god, wants me, and I want him, here now, in the elevator.You.Are.So.Sweet, he murmurs, each word a staccato.The elevator stops, the doors open, and he pushes away from me in the blink of an eye, leaving me hanging.Three men in business suits look at both of us and smirk as they climb on board.My heart rate is through the roof, I feel like Ive run an uphill race.I want to lean over and grasp my knees but thats just too obvious.I glance up at him.He looks so cool and calm, like hes been doing the Seattle Times crossword.How unfair.Is he totally unaffected by my presence?He glances at me out of the corner of his eye, and he gently blows out a deep breath.Oh, hes affected all right   and my very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba.The businessmen exit on the second floor.We have one more floor to travel.Youve brushed your teeth, he says, staring at me.I used your toothbrush, I breathe.His lips quirk up in a half smile.Oh, Anastasia Steele, what am I going to do with you?The doors open at the first floor, and he takes my hand and pulls me out.What is it about elevators?he mutters, more to himself than to me as he strides across the lobby.I struggle to keep pace with him because my wits have been thoroughly, royally, scattered all over the floor and walls of elevator three in the Heathman Hotel.Christian opens the passenger door to the black Audi SUV, and I clamber in.Its a beast of a car.He hasnt mentioned the outburst of passion that exploded in the elevator.Should I?Should we talk about it or pretend that it didnt happen?It hardly seems real, my first proper no holds barred kiss.As time ticks on, I assign it mythical, Arthurian legend, Lost City of Atlantis status.It never happened, it never existed.Perhaps I imagined it all.No.I touch my lips, swollen from his kiss.It definitely happened.I am a changed woman.I want this man, desperately, and he wanted me.I glance at him.Christian is his usual polite, slightly distant self.How confusing.He starts the engine and reverses out of his space in the parking lot.He switches on the MP3 player.The car interior is filled with the sweetest, most magical music of two women singing.Oh wow all my senses are in disarray, so this is doubly affecting.It sends delicious shivers up my spine.Christian pulls out on to SW Park Avenue, and he drives with easy, lazy confidence.What are we listening to?Its the Flower Duet by Delibes, from the opera Lakm.Do you like it?Christian, its wonderful.It is, isnt it?he grins, glancing at me.And for a fleeting moment, he seems his age; young, carefree, and heart stoppingly beautiful.Is this the key to him?Music?I sit and listen to the angelic voices, teasing and seducing me.Can I hear that again?Of course.Christian pushes a button, and the music is caressing me once more.Its a gentle, slow, sweet, and sure assault on my aural senses.You like classical music?I ask, hoping for a rare insight into his personal preferences.My taste is eclectic, Anastasia, everything from Thomas Tallis to the Kings of Leon.It depends on my mood.You?Me too.Though I dont know who Thomas Tallis is.He turns and gazes at me briefly before his eyes are back on the road.Ill play it for you sometime.Hes a sixteenth century British composer.Tudor, church choral music.Christian grins at me.Sounds very esoteric, I know, but its also magical, Anastasia.He presses a button, and the Kings of Leon start singing.Hmm this I know.Sex on Fire.How appropriate.The music is interrupted by the sound of a cell phone ringing over the MP3 speakers.Christian hits a button on the steering wheel.Grey, he snaps.Hes so brusque.Mr.Grey, its Welch here.I have the information you require.A rasping, disembodied voice comes over the speakers.Good.Email it to me.Anything to add?No sir.He presses the button, then the call ceases and the music is back.No goodbye or thanks.Im so glad that I never seriously entertained the thought of working for him.I shudder at the very idea.Hes just too controlling and cold with his employees.The music cuts off again for the phone.Grey.The NDA has been emailed to you, Mr.Grey.A womans voice.Good.Thats all, Andrea.Good day, sir.Christian hangs up by pressing a button on the steering wheel.The music is on very briefly when the phone rings again.Holy hell, is this his life, constant nagging phone calls?Grey, he snaps.Hi, Christian, dyou get laid?Hello, Elliot  Im on speaker phone, and Im not alone in the car, Christian sighs.Whos with you?Christian rolls his eyes.Anastasia Steele.Hi, Ana!Ana!Hello, Elliot.Heard a lot about you, Elliot murmurs huskily.Christian frowns.Dont believe a word Kate says.Elliot laughs.Im dropping Anastasia off now.Christian emphasizes my name.Shall I pick you up?Sure.See you shortly.Christian hangs up, and the music is back.Why do you insist on calling me Anastasia?Because its your name.I prefer Ana.Do you now?he murmurs.We are almost at my apartment.Its not taken long.Anastasia, he muses.I scowl at him, but he ignores my expression.What happened in the elevator   it wont happen again, well, not unless its premeditated.He pulls up outside my duplex.I belatedly realize hes not asked me where I live   yet he knows.But then he sent the books, of course he knows where I live.What able, cell phone tracking, helicopter owning, stalker wouldnt.Why wont he kiss me again?I pout at the thought.I dont understand.Honestly, his surname should be Cryptic, not Grey.He climbs out of the car, walking with easy, long legged grace round to my side to open the door, ever the gentleman   except perhaps in rare, precious moments in elevators.I flush at the memory of his mouth on mine, and the thought that Id been unable to touch him enters my mind.I wanted to run my fingers through his decadent, untidy hair, but Id been unable to move my hands.I am retrospectively frustrated.I liked what happened in the elevator, I murmur as I climb out of the car.Im not sure if I hear an audible gasp, but I choose to ignore it and head up the steps to the front door.Kate and Elliot are sitting at our dining table.The fourteen thousand dollar books have disappeared.Thank heavens.I have plans for them.She has the most un Kate ridiculous grin on her face, and she looks mussed up in a sexy kind of way.Christian follows me into the living area, and in spite of her Ive been having a good time all night grin, Kate eyes him suspiciously.Hi Ana.She leaps up to hug me, then holds me at arms length so she can examine me.She frowns and turns to Christian.Good morning, Christian, she says, and her tone is a little hostile.Miss Kavanagh, he says in his stiff formal way.Christian, her name is Kate, Elliot grumbles.Kate.Christian gives her a polite nod and glares at Elliot who grins and rises to hug me too.Hi, Ana, he smiles, his blue eyes twinkling, and I like him immediately.Hes obviously nothing like Christian, but then theyre adopted brothers.Hi, Elliot, I smile at him, and Im aware that Im biting my lip.Elliot, wed better go.Christian says mildly.Sure.He turns to Kate and pulls her into his arms and gives her a long lingering kiss.Jeez get a room.I stare at my feet, embarrassed.I glance up at Christian, and hes watching me intently.I narrow my eyes at him.Why cant you kiss me like that?Elliot continues to kiss Kate, sweeping her off her feet and dipping her in a dramatic hold so that her hair touches the ground as he kisses her hard.Laters, baby, he grins.Kate just melts.Ive never seen her melt before  the words comely and compliant come to mind.Compliant Kate, boy, Elliot must be good.Christian rolls his eyes and stares down at me, his expression unreadable, although maybe hes mildly amused.He tucks a stray strand of my hair that has worked its way free from my ponytail behind my ear.My breath hitches at the contact, and I lean my head slightly into his fingers.His eyes soften, and he runs his thumb across my lower lip.My blood sears in my veins.And all too quickly, his touch is gone.Laters, baby, he murmurs, and I have to laugh because its so unlike him.But even though I know hes being irreverent, the endearment tugs at something deep inside me.Ill pick you up at eight.He turns to leave, opening the front door and stepping out on to the porch.Elliot follows him to the car but turns and blows Kate another kiss, and I feel an unwelcome pang of jealousy.So, did you?Kate asks as we watch them climb into the car and drive off, the burning curiosity evident in her voice.No, I snap irritably, hoping that will halt the questions.We head back into the apartment.You obviously did, though.I cant contain my envy.Kate always manages to ensnare men.She is irresistible, beautiful, sexy, funny, forward all the things that Im not.But her answering grin is infectious.And Im seeing him again this evening.She claps her hands and jumps up and down like a small child.She cannot contain her excitement and happiness, and I cant help but feel happy for her.A happy Kate this is going to be interesting.Christian is taking me to Seattle this evening.Seattle?Yes.Maybe you will then?Oh, I hope so.You like him then?Yes.Like him enough to ?Yes.She raises her eyebrows.Wow.Ana Steele, finally falling for a man, and its Christian Grey  hot, sexy billionaire.Oh yeah  its all about the money.I smirk, and we both fall into a fit of giggles.Is that a new blouse?she asks, and I let her have all the unexciting details about my night.Has he kissed you yet?she asks as she makes coffee.I blush.Once.Once!she scoffs.I nod, rather shame faced.Hes very reserved.She frowns.Thats odd.I dont think odd covers it really, I murmur.We need to make sure youre simply irresistible for this evening, she says with determination.Oh no this sounds like it will be time consuming, humiliating, and painful.I have to be at work in an hour.I can work with that timeframe.Come on.Kate grabs my hand and takes me into her bedroom.The day drags at Claytons even though were busy.Weve hit the summer season, so I have to spend two hours restocking the shelves once the shop is closed.Its mindless work, and it gives me too much time to think.Ive not really had a chance all day.Under Kates tireless and frankly intrusive instruction, my legs and underarms are shaved to perfection, my eyebrows plucked, and I am buffed all over.It has been a most unpleasant experience.But she assures me that this is what men expect these days.What else will he expect?I have to convince Kate that this is what I want to do.For some strange reason, she doesnt trust him, maybe because hes so stiff and formal.She says she cant put her finger on it, but I have promised to text her when I arrive in Seattle.I havent told her about the helicopter, shed freak.I also have the Jos issue.Hes left three messages and seven missed calls on my cell.Hes also called home twice.Kate has been very vague as to where I am.Hell know shes covering for me.Kate doesnt do vague.But I have decided to let him stew.Im still too angry with him.Christian mentioned some kind of written paperwork, and I dont know if he was joking or if Im going to have to sign something.Its so frustrating trying to guess.And on top of all the angst, I can barely contain my excitement or my nerves.Tonights the night!After all this time, am I ready for this?My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatiently.Shes been ready for this for years, and shes ready for anything with Christian Grey, but I still dont understand what he sees in me mousey Ana Steele   it makes no sense.He is punctual, of course, and waiting for me when I leave Claytons.He climbs out of the back of the Audi to open the door and smiles warmly at me.Good evening, Miss Steele, he says.Mr.Grey.I nod politely to him as I climb into the backseat of the car.Taylor is sitting in the drivers seat.Hello, Taylor, I say.Good evening, Miss Steele, his voice is polite and professional.Christian climbs in the other side and clasps my hand, giving it a gentle squeeze that I feel all the way though my body.How was work?he asks.Very long, I reply, and my voice is husky, too low, and full of need.Yes, its been a long day for me too.His tone is serious.What did you do?I manage.I went hiking with Elliot.His thumb strokes my knuckles, back and forth, and my heart skips a beat as my breathing accelerates.How does he do this to me?Hes only touching a very small area of my body, and the hormones are flying.The drive to the heliport is short and, before I know it, we arrive.I wonder where the fabled helicopter might be.Were in a built up area of the city and even I know helicopters need space to take off and land.Taylor parks, climbs out, and opens my car door.Christian is beside me in an instant and takes my hand again.Ready?he asks.I nod and want to say for anything, but I cant articulate the words as Im too nervous, too excited.Taylor.He nods curtly at his driver, and we head into the building, straight to a set of elevators.Elevator!The memory of our kiss this morning comes back to haunt me.I have thought of nothing else all day.Daydreaming at the register at Claytons.Twice Mr.Clayton had to shout my name to bring me back to Earth.To say Ive been distracted would be the understatement of the year.Christian glances down at me, a slight smile on his lips.Ha!Hes thinking about it too.Its only three floors, he says dryly, his gray eyes dancing with amusement.Hes telepathic surely.Its spooky.I try to keep my face impassive as we enter the elevator.The doors close, and its there, the weird electrical attraction crackling between us, enslaving me.I close my eyes in a vain attempt to ignore it.He tightens his grip on my hand, and five seconds later the doors open on to the roof of the building.And there it is, a white helicopter with the name Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.written in blue with the company logo on the side.Surely this is misuse of Company property.He leads me to a small office where an old timer sits behind the desk.Heres your flight plan, Mr.Grey.All external checks are done.Its ready and waiting sir.Youre free to go.Thank you, Joe.Christian smiles warmly at him.Oh.Someone deserving of the polite treatment from Christian, perhaps hes not an employee.I stare at the old guy in awe.Lets go, Christian says, and we make our way toward the helicopter.When were up close, its much bigger than I thought.I expected it to be a roadster version for two, but it has at least seven seats.Christian opens the door and directs me to one of the seats at the very front.Sit  dont touch anything, he orders as he clambers in behind me.He shuts the door with a slam.Im glad that the area is floodlit, otherwise Id find it difficult to see inside the small cockpit.I sit down in my allotted seat, and he crouches beside me to strap me into the harness.Its a four point harness with all the straps connecting to one central buckle.He tightens both of the upper straps, so I can hardly move.Hes so close and intent on what hes doing.If I could only lean forward, my nose would be in his hair.He smells, clean, fresh, heavenly, but Im fastened securely into my seat and effectively immobile.He glances up and smiles, like hes enjoying his usual private joke, his gray eyes heated.Hes so tantalizingly close.I hold my breath as he pulls at one of the upper straps.Youre secure, no escaping, he whispers, his eyes are scorching.Breathe, Anastasia, he adds softly.Reaching up, he caresses my cheek, running his long fingers down to my chin which he grasps between his thumb and forefinger.He leans forward and plants a brief, chaste kiss on my lips, leaving me reeling, my insides clenching at the thrilling, unexpected touch of his lips.I like this harness, he whispers.What?He sits down beside me and buckles himself into his seat, then begins a protracted procedure of checking gauges and flipping switches and buttons from the mind boggling array of dials and lights and switches in front of me.Little lights wink and flash from various dials, and the whole of the instrument panel lights up.Put your cans on, he says, pointing to a set of headphones in front of me.I pop them on, and the rotor blades start.They are deafening.He puts his headphones on and continues flipping various switches.Im just going through all the pre flight checks.Christians disembodied voice is in my ears through the headphones.I turn and grin at him.Do you know what you are doing?I ask.He turns and smiles at me.Ive been a fully qualified pilot for four years, Anastasia, youre safe with me.He gives me a wolfish grin.Well, while were flying, he adds and winks at me.Winking Christian!Are you ready?I nod wide eyed.Okay, tower.PDX this is Charlie Tango Golf  Golf Echo Hotel, cleared for take off.Please confirm, over.Charlie Tango   you are clear.PDX to call, proceed to one four thousand, heading zero one zero, over.Roger tower, Charlie Tango set, over and out.Here we go, he adds to me, and the helicopter rises slowly and smoothly into the air.Portland disappears in front us as we head into US airspace, though my stomach remains firmly in Oregon.Whoa!All the bright lights shrink until they are twinkling sweetly below us.Its like looking out from inside a fish bowl.Once were higher, there really is nothing to see.Its pitch black, not even the moon to shed any light on our journey.How can he see where were going?Eerie isnt it?Christians voice is in my ears.How do you know youre going the right way?Here.He points his long index finger at one of the gauges, and it shows an electronic compass.This is an EC135 Eurocopter.One of the safest in its class.Its equipped for night flight.He glances and grins at me.Theres a helipad on top of the building I live in.Thats where were heading.Of course theres a helipad where he lives.I am so out of my league here.His face is softly illuminated by the lights on the instrument panel.Hes concentrating hard, and hes continually glancing at the various dials in front of him.I drink in his features from beneath my lashes.He has a beautiful profile.Straight nose, square jawed  Id like to run my tongue along his jaw.He hasnt shaved, and his stubble makes the prospect doubly tempting.Hmm Id like to feel how rough it is beneath my tongue, my fingers, against my face.When you fly at night, you fly blind.You have to trust the instrumentation, he interrupts my erotic reverie.How long will the flight be?I manage breathlessly.I wasnt thinking about sex at all, no, no way.Less than an hour, the wind is in our favor.Hmm, less than an hour to Seattle thats not bad going, no wonder were flying.I have less than an hour before the big reveal.All the muscles clench deep in my belly.I have a serious case of butterflies.They are flourishing in my stomach.Holy shit, what has he got in store for me?You okay, Anastasia?Yes.My answer is short, clipped, squeezed out through my nerves.I think he smiles, but its difficult to tell in the darkness.Christian flicks yet another switch.PDX this is Charlie Tango now at one four thousand, over.He exchanges information with air traffic control.It all sounds very professional to me.I think were moving from Portlands air space to Seattle International Airports.Understood Sea Tac, standing by over and out.Look, over there.He points to a small pin point of light in the far distance.Thats Seattle.Do you always impress women this way?Come and fly in my helicopter?I ask, genuinely interested.Ive never bought a girl up here, Anastasia.Its another first for me.His voice is quiet, serious.Oh, that was an unexpected answer.Another first?Oh the sleeping thing, perhaps?Are you impressed?Im awed, Christian.He smiles.Awed?And for a brief moment, hes his age again.I nod.Youre just so competent.Why, thank you, Miss Steele, he says politely.I think hes pleased, but Im not sure.We ride into the dark night in silence for a while.The bright spot that is Seattle is slowly getting bigger.Sea Tac tower to Charlie Tango.Flight plan to Escala in place.Please proceed.And standby.Over.This is Charlie Tango, understood Sea Tac.Standing by, over and out.You obviously enjoy this, I murmur.What?He glances at me.He looks quizzical in the half light of the instruments.Flying, I reply.It requires control and concentration how could I not love it?Though, my favorite is soaring.Soaring?Yes.Gliding to the layperson.Gliders and helicopters  I fly them both.Oh.Expensive hobbies.I remember him telling me during the interview.I like reading and occasionally going to the movies.I am out of my depth here.Charlie Tango come in please, over.The disembodied voice of air traffic control interrupts my reverie.Christian answers, sounding in control and confident.Seattle is getting closer.We are on the very outskirts now.Wow!It looks absolutely stunning.Seattle at night, from the sky  Looks good, doesnt it?Christian murmurs.I nod enthusiastically.It looks otherworldly  unreal  and I feel like Im on a giant film set, Joss favorite film maybe, Bladerunner.The memory of Joss attempted kiss haunts me.Im beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back.He can wait until tomorrow surely.Well be there in a few minutes, Christian mutters, and suddenly my blood is pounding in my ears as my heartbeat accelerates and adrenaline spikes through my system.He starts talking to air traffic control again, but I am no longer listening.Oh my I think Im going to faint.My fate is in his hands.We are now flying amongst the buildings, and up ahead I can see a tall skyscraper with a helipad on top.The word Escala is painted in white on top of the building.Its getting nearer and nearer, bigger and bigger like my anxiety.God, I hope I dont let him down.Hell find me lacking in some way.I wish Id listened to Kate and borrowed one of her dresses, but I like my black jeans, and Im wearing a soft mint green shirt and Kates black jacket.I look smart enough.I grip the edge of my seat tighter and tighter.I can do this.I can do this.I chant this mantra as the skyscraper looms below us.The helicopter slows and hovers, and Christian sets it down on the helipad on top of the building.My heart is in my mouth.I cant decide if its from nervous anticipation, relief that weve arrived alive, or fear that I will fail in some way.He switches the ignition off and the rotor blades slow and quiet until all I hear is the sound of my own erratic breathing.Christian takes his headphones off, and reaches across and pulls mine off too.Were here, he says softly.His look is so intense, half in shadow and half in the bright white light from the landing lights.Dark knight and white knight, its a fitting metaphor for Christian.He looks strained.His jaw is clenched and his eyes are tight.He unfastens his seatbelt and reaches over to unbuckle mine.His face is inches from mine.You dont have to do anything you dont want to do.You know that dont you?His tone is so earnest, desperate even, his gray eyes impassioned.He takes me by surprise.Id never do anything I didnt want to do, Christian.And as I say the words, I dont quite feel their conviction because at this moment in time  Id probably do anything for this man seated beside me.But this does the trick.Hes mollified.He eyes me warily for a moment and somehow, even though hes so tall, he manages to ease his way gracefully to the door of the helicopter and open it.He jumps out, waiting for me to follow, and takes my hand as I clamber down on to the helipad.Its very windy on top of the building, and Im nervous about the fact that Im standing at least thirty stories high in an unenclosed space.Christian wraps his arm around my waist, pulling me tightly against him.Come, he shouts above the noise of the wind.He drags me over to an elevator shaft and, after tapping a number into a keypad, the doors open.Its warm inside and all mirrored glass.I can see Christian to infinity everywhere I look, and the wonderful thing is, hes holding me to infinity too.Christian taps another code into the keypad, then the doors close and the elevator descends.Moments later, were in an all white foyer.In the middle is a round, dark wood table, and on it is an unbelievably huge bunch of white flowers.On the walls there are paintings, everywhere.He opens two double doors, and the white theme continues through the wide corridor and directly opposite where a palatial room opens up.Its the main living area, double height.Huge is too small a word for it.The far wall is glass and leads on to a balcony that overlooks Seattle.To the right is an imposing U shaped sofa that could sit ten adults comfortably.
