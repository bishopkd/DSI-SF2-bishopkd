Abby is the blonde facing the wrong way.He pointed through the glass to the little girl three down from Jacob who was staring out the window while everyone else was looking at the teacher.We need to do more work on knowing left from right, he sighed.She laughed, and his attention made her blush like a peach.An awkward schoolgirl peach.And you?he asked.Oh, I know my left from right.No, his eyes were kind and she got lost for a moment in those eyelashes, which kid is yours?Her blush turned radioactive.Maybe if she wasnt such a damn hermit shed know how to talk to handsome strangers.Oh, my son.Jacob was the only boy, and his fierce frown was so cartoonish both Victoria and the man laughed.Im afraid he doesnt like ballet.Most boys dont.My mom put me in violin lessons when I was your sons age.All I wanted to do was play junior tackle.Her heart shuddered at the thought of Jacob in junior tackle.Are you from around here?she asked.Nope.Arkansas.My sister moved here with her husband ten years ago.I have a lot of business in Dallas and I try to visit a few times a year.He pulled up the fabric of his black pants and crossed his legs.The distance between his knee and her thigh was minuscule and she felt his warmth through her skirt.Awareness, prickly and foreign, made her sit up straighter in her chair, pulling her leg from the magnetic force of his.She caught him looking at her hands, unsure of what he was doing until it dawned on her that he was checking for rings and it was so new, so strange, she clenched her fingers in her lap.For a long moment she wanted to just curl up and die.You never do anything right, she berated herself.Im sorry.He ran a hand over his face.IIm not good at this.Since my divorceI dont know what Im supposed to do.There arent any rules for dating again.Do I just ask if youre married?Or do I just wait until your husband walks in and I get my hopes crushed?She stared at her hands, her ears buzzing.How was this happening?Here?Now?He made her feel somehow young.As if the last year of her life were melting away under this mans attention.No rings, she finally said, glancing sideways in time to see him smile.Are you from here?he asked.She shook her head.My father died, and my son and I are spending the summer getting things in order.Im sorry to hear about your father.His sympathy, while sweet and warm and comforting, made her uncomfortable, all too aware of the half truths shed been telling.Dont be, she said with a half smile.We werent close.Lyle Baker wasnt close to anyone, really.Lyle Baker?Lyle Baker died?He blew out a long breath.Did you know him?He nodded slowly, his gaze unblinking, on his feet.We did some real estate deals a few years ago.I knew hed been sickI cant believe Old Man Baker is dead.He was such a force of nature.Victoria felt oddly like she should comfort this stranger, who was taking her fathers death with more honest grief than shed been able to manufacture.Tell me He stopped, then lifted his hand, cutting himself off.Never mind.Im sorry, this is personal.How about you ask and Ill decide.Did your father marry a woman named Tara Jean Sweet?How do you know about her?Well, last time I was in town that was the rumor, and I knew a girl in high school named Jane Simmonsshed changed her name to Tara Jean Sweet and honestly, I cant believe there are two women with a name like that.They didnt get married, she said, trying not to mutter.Trying not to sound raw and angry at just the mention of the womans name.He died first.Is she blond?Real pretty?Victoria nodded and the man laughed, wiping a hand over an astonished face.Wow.Small world, huh?Were you good friends?His hesitation spoke volumes.We grew up together, but she wasshe was a troubled kid.Without a doubt they were talking about the same Tara Jean Sweet.Shes still at the ranch, she said.Ill have to stop byif thats all right?Of course, she said.She wasnt sure what force was motivating her.The drugging nature of his smile, the length of his eyelashes, the price tag on that watch.She didnt know and she wasnt going to scrutinize it.In a life that was being scrutinized down to the last penny, she was going tofor onceact without thinking everything to death.Come on out tonight, she said.After class.My brother is picking us up here.You and Abby can follow us.Oh, Abbys mom is picking her up.But I would comeif youre sure.She nodded, definitively, her smile so wide and real it nearly hurt to keep it.That would be great, thank you.His eyes touched her face, wandered across her lips.You have a beautiful smile, he said, and she blushed with pleasure.My name is Victoria, she said, leaving off her last name in case it should once again ruin everything.Im very happy to meet you, Victoria.His hand took hers and she felt the buzz and the thrill, the cloud of desire enter her bloodstream.My name is Dennis.Saturday night, Tara Jean walked into the house looking for Ruby.Shed stuck close to the ranch, scared that Dennis might be waiting for her at her apartment if he hadnt left town, but as the days passed it became more obvious that hed moved on.All week shed been coming into the house long past dinner, avoiding the family and eating leftovers hunched over the sink.Trying not to see anyone.Well, trying not to see Luc, mostly.But now, this small sized model crisis was forcing her to face the dragons in their den.It was dinnertime, but the formal dining room was empty, not even set for dinner.The kitchen was still, nothing bubbling away on the stove, no delicious smells wafting from the oven.Very bizarre.Hello?she yelled.Only silence answered.She walked down dark hallways, past hushed rooms, and realized that the house used to be like this; just a few weeks ago, when it was only her and Ruby minding Lyle in turns.Eli joined them occasionally, but he usually slept in his house on the other side of the creek three miles away.Funny how a family seemed to pad a house, fill its empty spaces.Crowd into the corners.So when that family was gone the house seemed extra empty.Incomplete.The TV was on in the den and she followed the sound of applause only to find Ruby and Celeste, eating tuna fish and green grapes, their feet propped up on the coffee table.Watching a dance show on the flat screen.Hi, Ruby said, popping up when she saw Tara Jean.Guilty, as if shed been caught consorting with the enemy.Where is everyone?Tara asked, and Celeste finally turned to look at her.The elegant woman wore red yoga pants with a matching jacket, the color making her dramatic hair even more theatrical.Well, Luc found an ice rink in Dallas, and Victoria took Jacob to his dance class, she said.Oh, Tara Jean said, all the courage shed mustered up to face the dragons in their den falling flat.The dragons were eating tuna and watching a dance show.That didnt require much courage.But Celeste was still staring at her like she had some fire to breathe.My son tells me that you are a designer for Lyles little leather store.The little leather store is actually a multimillion dollar chain, she said, prickling up probably just as Celeste intended.You still making cheap bags and thongs?Only the cheapest.Celestes beautiful lips that could only be maintained by the grace of God, or the careful and subtle application of collagen on a regular basis, curled into a smile.Ruby, Tara said, ignoring Celeste and getting back to the matters of her kingdom.Does your niece still live in Springfield?Ruby nodded, tuna clinging for life to her wide bottom lip.Remember last year when she helped me with some fittings?Do you think she could do it again?Ruby rolled her eyes.She made us all crazy for weeks talking about her big modeling break, and three weeks later she was back working doubles at Dairy Queen.Im sure shed love to do it.I can call her.Its two weeks, not much notice Well see.Ruby relaxed back into her seat.If you want tuna salad, theres more in the fridge.No, thank you, Tara said, but her stomach growled in protest.Celeste smirked.In the kitchen, she filled a bowl and grabbed some grapes and crackers, and then lingered in the quiet room, suffering a strange attack of indecision.She could go to her room, or back out to the workshopthere was always work to be done.But for some reason the den seemed more appealing.She wasnt invested in the TV show, and Lyles ex wife clearly didnt like her.But still, it seemed more interesting than being by herself.Feeling oddly defiant, she went back into the den and sat in the oversized chair.By the time the show was over, Tara Jean was fully committed to the young break dancer from Los Angeles, and Ruby had brought out a box of chocolate chip cookies that totally negated the virtuousness of the tuna fish.But Celeste ate two and it seemed like a party.The front door slammed open, smashing the encapsulated peace of the den, and Tara Jean leapt out of her chair, her heart in her throat.Hello!Jacob yelled, and Tara crumpled slightly in relief.Celeste was staring at her, her brilliant eyes missing nothing.Were in here!Celeste yelled, and it sounded as if a herd of elephants stampeded toward them.Such was the power of one excited kid.Hey, Jacob said, charging into the room, his face flushed and his hair askew.His eyes were bright, and Tara Jean smiled in response to the electric joy that radiated out of him like sunshine.She wanted to tilt her head back and bathe in that boys sunlight.Luc followed, his eyes finding her right away, and the smile froze on her face.He wore jeans and a gray T shirt that stretched over his shoulders and flirted with the strong muscles of his chest.The shirt was indecent.The shirt should be arrested.But his face was a warning flag, tense and lined, as if he were waiting for an outcome that was bad either way.Tara Jean, Jacob said, jumping on one foot.Youll never guess.She jerked back, surprised that the boy was talking to her.Guess what?she stammered.We ran into an old friend of yours, Victoria said, stepping into the room.She looked changed too.Gone was the weariness, replaced by a manic brightness, totally manufactured and slightly scary.Hello, Tara Jean, the devil cooed, looking smug and rotten.A cancer in this house.It was Dennis.14 Mr.Beanfang had taught Tara a lesson about security.All of them had, but because Mr.Beanfang was first, he was tattooed into her brain with the ink of shame and regret.God, shed been a kid, fresh from her sixteenth birthday, though shed probably been the oldest sixteen year old around.Shed just met Dennis at one of the lowest points in her whole life and hed seemed likea rainbow.A promise sent from heaven that the bad times were over.Mr.Beanfang had been Denniss idea.Dennis had convinced her to take part in his scam because Mr.Beanfang was dying and he was rich and most importantly, he was alone.No one would care who he gave his money away to.And Mr.Beanfang had so much money it didnt seem to matter.It was as if the dollar bills were litter on his bedside table, his dresser, stuffed into the pockets of his robe.He gave it away to everyoneto the orderlies, the woman who came in to cut his toenails and trim his nose hair.Those good and honest people tried to refuse, but he insisted.Tara didnt even try to refuse.For her entire life shed equated money with security.But none of Mr.Beanfangs money kept him safe.That first day when shed come in pretending to look for her own grandfather, hed asked her to sit, told her that she looked like his long dead wife.Theyd talked, and when she offered to read him the paper, his big blue eyes went watery and his hands shook with gratitude.The plan had worked so well it felt like fate.Like God saying it was all right to take some of this mans excess for all the years of nothing shed had.He gave her money.Watches.A pearl ring that had belonged to his wife.And she made him a victim.Security was a sham.That was Mr.Beanfangs lesson.Forty percent of a company didnt make Tara Jean secure.Leaving that hospital four years ago, running away from Dennis with a concussion and three broken ribs, an eye so swollen she couldnt see out of it, to come out here with Lyle didnt make her secure.Money.The apartment with the locks.Changing her name.None of it had worked.Staring at Dennis in the TV room of the Crooked Creek Ranch, she realized she hadnt scared away the devil.Shed waved a red flag in front of his eyes.Shed invited him here with her brave fuck off.Fear was a sandstorm obliterating the landscape.Her ears buzzed while handshakes were exchanged.Friendly greetings.She heard, through the deafening drone of her panic and fear, Dennis talk about being in town on a real estate business deal.An old lie.Threadbare and full of holes.He was desperate, working off the dimming wattage of his smile.His slick suit and finely polished shoes.A high gloss patina on a fake.But the act still played.Even Celeste seemed to be buying it.And Victoria, ChristVictoria was eating it up as fast as Dennis could spoon it out.Can I talk to you?It was as if shed screamed into a tin canher voice was too loud, too sharp.Everyone stared at her, as though she was the one poisoning the air.Its been so long, she said with a smooth smile, sliding her arm under Denniss.Her skin crawled at the touch; her stomach heaved at his nearness.Of course, he said, smiling down at her fondly and then back up at the gathered Bakers.It was a pleasure.Again, friendly exchanges.Polite and civilized all the way around, and inside Tara was begging for mercy.Finally, she was able to lead him out into the hallway.Nice place you got here, he murmured, his eyes missing nothing.Not the paintings or the rugs.He could put price tags on the light fixtures.She led him out of the house and down the verandah steps, across the yard to the door of the greenhouse.The gate to her kingdom.For a moment, she hesitated, unsure of how she could clean this place of him once hed stepped inside.But he was here and she had to handle it.She unlocked the door and flipped on the light, and as soon as he was in the greenhouse, she dropped his arm, getting as far away from him as she could.Surprised you, didnt I?He grinned at her as if hed brought an unexpected bouquet of flowers instead of ruination.What are you doing here?You cant run from me, Jane.He shook his head, as if she were a bad student.He stepped farther into the studio and ran his hands over the cutting table, trailing his fingers across the white leather bustier on the tailor dummy.Dont look, the demon whispered, the way she used to when one of her boyfriends would trash their trailer.Dont let yourself see what he touches.The weight of his filth, of his malice, turned the air to mud and she couldnt breathe.But shed stared this man down once; she could do it again.Were done, Dennis.Well, now, I think my being here changes that, doesnt it?It did.It really did.Because it proved that she wasnt going to be able to sever herself from him without payment.She should have known that to begin with.Fine.With hands that shook, she took out her checkbook.The company checkbook, big and black, representative of so much more money than she had, sat under it.She left it there, slamming shut the desk drawer.I gave ten thousand dollars back to Terry Dickow I dont want ten grand.He slid toward her like a snail on his own malevolence.All I have in my savings is twelve thousand dollars.The closer he got, the harder it was to hide her fear, and she wanted to stand there and be strong, impervious, but when he cleared the corner of her desk she sidestepped.The moment she moved, he was on her.His hand a clamp around her throat, lifting her chin.His eyes bored into hers and he pushed her against the wall, her head ricocheting off the wall.You dont tell me to fuck off.You dont walk away from me.Okay.Okay.She clutched his hands, trying to get him to stop.You and me, were never done.Change your name.Move.It doesnt matter.He leaned close, his chin grazing her neck, and she swallowed a whimper.I could smell you, Jane.A hundred miles away.In jail.At night.I could taste you.She swallowed back bile and shut her eyes, gathering her forces as best she could.How muchhow much money, Dennis?Two hundred thousand dollars.Her eyes flew open.What?He squeezed her throat, shook her, like she was a rag doll and he was a dinosaur.Stupid theory about holding her own in a fight with smaller men.She was just so stupid sometimes.Two hundred, he cooed in her face, leaning forward so his breath spilled like a minty fresh garbage dump over her mouth.Or what?she spat.This was how shed ended up in the hospital.He could beat her, but he couldnt break her.She could fight.So she would.He stepped closer until his body pressed against hers and she could feel his erection, like a knife against her stomach.The fear became so dense, so all encompassing, that she was suddenly lifted free of it, carried on the painless wings of shock.I dont have two hundred thousand dollars, she said.Rape me.Beat me.That wont change.But you can get it.That anger in his eyes changed to triumph.Dennis wasnt stupid.He was mean as a snake and evil down to his toes, but he was smart.And looking at him, she knew she was suddenly in more trouble than shed ever been in before.Look at this place.You could probably get more.Im an employee, Dennis.I dont own He got back in her face and she licked her dry lips with a drier tongue.Remember my friend Carl?Terrified, she nodded.Carl was the man whod beat her up alongside Dennis.The man who did the hard work Dennis didnt have the stomach for.He asks about you.Wouldnt mind seeing you again.How would you like that?Terror pushed her down new roads, roads shed been too scared and selfish to use before, but things were getting critical.How would you like it if I went to the cops?Because Ill do it, Dennis.I swear I will.Look at you and your empty threats.His patronizing smile made her sick.You know, youre just a kid, so Ill explain something to you.What you did to those old men, its called fraud.And you go to the cops and youll have to tell them what you did, and they will put you away, Jane.And a woman like you in jail He whistled long and low, pushing that erection against her.What those women will do to you?It will make you wish for me.So, cut that crap.Youre a coward, Jane.Deep down, youre chicken shit.You couldnt tell your mama when you were in trouble when you were a kid; you couldnt say no to me, even though you pretended you wanted to.And youre not going to risk your own neck to put me away.Now, get back to reality.His thumb stroked the hammering pulse in her throat and then, as she held out, staring him in the eye, he pressed hard on that pulse.Her vision went sparkly at the edges, her head light, but still she dared him to take it one step further, because she didnt want to be the woman hed just described.Look at you, he sighed, smiling slightly.So tough.I swear, Jane, you ask for it.If youd just lie down like a good dog But in the end, she was exactly who he said she was.A coward, selfish and greedy.Because she was too scared to risk her freedom just to put him away.Conceding, she looked away, sagging against the wall where hed pushed her.Thats what I thought.So, Jane, as I was saying, two hundred thousand dollars.Or what?OrI do to Victoria what you did to all those little old men.She has nothing, Dennis, she said, frantically trying to change the course of this particular river.Not a single penny.And no access to any, not for a long time, and she wouldnt give it to you anyway.Not with her son She stopped.Bringing Jacob into this situation, even by saying his name, felt vile.Leave them alone.I will, Dennis said.If you get me that money.She swallowed, silent.The scales were so heavy in both directions she felt that she might collapse.Seems to me Victoria might just need a friend like me.A man who can make her feel like a woman again.You remember, dont you, how grateful those old men were I never touched them, she snapped.Not once.Not ever.Well, Victoria is different, isnt she?Shed probably be so damn grateful shed give me whatever she had, and maybe whatever her brother has too.Stop it!The scales finally tipped, bringing her to her knees.Just stop it, fine.Ill get you the two hundred thousand.ButIll need some time.He stepped away and she took a deep breath.Another.Not too much, he said, pulling the white cuff of his shirt past his jacket.Howdo I find you?His grin made her skin crawl.Ill be around.Leave this family alone, Dennis.Theyre good people.They have nothing to do with us.For a moment the threat vanished, and she saw the glimmer of the boy shed known.Misguided and greedy, but deep inside that thin chest had once beat a heart.Then whyd you come here?he asked.She had no answer.Guilt closed her throat and she rocked back, light headed with remorse.Luc wasnt sleeping when someone knocked on his door.He was staring out the window and thinking of Tara Jeans expression when Jacob had talked to her in the den.The mixture of wonder and fear on her face.It had been beautiful and real, and it had dredged up another thousand questions about the woman.Questions, no matter what his better sense was screaming, that he really wanted answered.The knock on the door shook him out of his thoughts and he was glad to have the distraction.And even gladder to see Tara Jean standing there, looking as if shed covered herself in armor and was about to drive into battle.Well, Tara Jean.He leaned against the doorjamb and her blue eyes slipped down his bare chest like a kid on a water slide.What can I do for you?He checked his watch.At midnight?I need to talk to you.Her eyesnaked and exposedlifted to his and as tough as she wanted to be, as thick as that armor went, there was no pretense.No game.She was a woman, smart and tough, and there was something wrong.Something that had driven her to his door at midnight.His instincts whispered that this had something to do with Dennis.A little too slick, that Dennis guy.Okay, he said.Everything all right?Meet me in the kitchen, she said, her eyes dipping over him again.And bring a shirt.A few minutes later he walked into the dark kitchen, illuminated only by the bone white glow of the moon through the windows.Tara Jean sat on the center island, eating ice cream right out of the carton.Wheres your shirt?she asked through a mouthful of rocky road.He shrugged, not wanting to tell her that he liked her eyes on him.That he wanted more of it, more of her.And that, really, she wasnt the boss of him.He could come into the kitchen naked if he wanted.You want to tell me whats wrong?He leaned against the counter directly across from her, stretching out his legs.She swung her feet and her bare toes brushed his knees.Both of them shifted away, as if this attraction between them was an unpredictable animal that needed lots of space.She took a bite of ice cream and then another.Is this about that Dennis guy?The spoon paused on its way back to the carton.Why would you think that?I dont know.He watched her carefully, waiting for an answer to one of his many questions.Just a vibe.How did he even hook up with you tonight?I have no idea.I met Jacob and Victoria after my workout and he was with them.She coughed as if the ice cream had gone down the wrong pipe, and he reached over and slapped her on the back.She scowled at him.He was getting fond of the hedgehog.Do I need to worry about my sister and nephew?he asked softly, feeling her ribs beneath his hands.She didnt shrug away from his touch, so he stroked her shoulder, sensing she needed a little human comfort.No, you dont need to worry.Dennis and I have some old business to take care of, thats all.He doesnt have anything to do with Victoria and Jacob.All right.He leaned back against the counter and crossed his arms over his chest.Then how about you tell me why youve dragged me to the kitchen in the middle of the night.How much would I make if we sold Baker Leather?I thought you didnt want to do that.I dont, she said and then laughed.I dont.I justI just want to know.Jenkins said your profits are good and growing.According to him, maybe as much as a million.Probably less.A million?The carton of ice cream slipped off her knee and he reached out and grabbed it.Standing so close to her in the moonlight was a heady torture, but the anxiety rolling off her was palpable.He stepped back, giving her some room.He fished a spoon out of the drawer and picked up where shed left off with the rocky road.Why?You need the money?She was quiet, staring down at her knees, the dark denim stretched over her legs.Tara?Im thinking.Her hair fell over her shoulders, a beautiful curtain that gleamed white in the moonlight.He ate silently, letting her think, wondering what was wrong and if shed ever tell him.Okay, she finally said and then lifted her head, tossing back her hair.Her smile was bright, blinding, but her eyes were calculating, measuring every angle.Looking for every escape route.The smile was a flash, a distraction, to hide how smart she was.Clever girl.You know my salary, she said and he nodded, scooping up another bite of ice cream.And you know I havent had a raise in four years, despite what Ive done for the company You can have a raise, he said.I dont care.I dont want a raise, she said, and then shook her head.No, I mean, yes, a raise would be great; we can talk about that later.But what I needwhat I want is a bonus.A bonus?he asked.Yep.For what?Her eyebrows knit together and he smiled in the face of her irritation.I got a bonus when I led my team to the Stanley Cup finals.And when I won the Rocket Richard trophy.Twice.I got a new car when I was named league MVP.I understand bonuses; they come after you do something to earn them.Fine, she said and sighed heavily through her nose.In two months I have a meeting with the District Four buyer for Nordstrom.Sounds exciting.It is, because if the meeting goes well, Nordstrom will carry the Baker Leather signature womens pink cowboy boot in stores all across Texas and Oklahoma.He hummed and dug for more peanuts.He wondered if hed ever get a crack at the Rocket Richard trophy again.Lashenko had won it this year.What a year that would bethirty eight years old, Stanley Cup, and the highest number of goals scored.Had anybody done that before?Come on.She yanked the carton out of his hands.Listen.Im listening.You want a bonus if this meeting goes well.Sounds reasonable to me.Two hundred thousand dollars.He blinked at her and then shrugged.Okay.She tried to hide her surprise at his quick capitulation, but she was caught flat footed for a second.He loved that.Surprising her wasnt easy.Okay?I told you, Tara Jean, I dont care about this company.But I know you do.Do you think getting the boot into Nordstrom is worth two hundred thousand dollars?She nodded.He wondered briefly about the bravado of a woman who never took a raise and had such problems asking for money in return for hard work.Do you think youre worth two hundred thousand dollars?What the hell does that mean?Im just wondering why you have so much trouble asking for what youre due.What youve earned.She picked up the ice cream carton.I havent earned it yet.But you turned the company around.It was bankrupt and now its thriving.Even growing.Thats worth something, Tara.Fine.Give me a raise.Her back was up and this wasnt what he wanted.He wanted to talk to that honest, vulnerable woman hed glimpsed a few times, beneath the glamour and the hard candy shell.He wanted to tell her that he saw the worth in her.The power and value.He reached out and touched her, his fingers glancing off the skin of her wrist.As if hed held a match to her skin, she jerked away from him, jumping to her feet.Sex does not determine my worth, she barked, and he saw that something had snapped in her and there was a river, wild and rushing the banks, raging right toward him.These, she crudely cupped her breasts, do not determine my worth.This, she ran a hand over her body, does not determine my worth.Then what does?Me!She was panting, heavy and hard, and he leaned forward, felt the heat of her breath on his face.Then do it.Like its that easy?He could tell she wanted to sneer, hold on to her sarcasm, like the last piece of driftwood keeping her afloat, but the question came out plaintive.My dad told me I was worthless my whole life, he said.Beat it, and I mean beat it, into me.Into my sister.We werent good with horses or cows.We werent fit to be Bakers.He rubbed a hand over his face, down his chest, wishing, too late, that he had put a shirt on.And II believed him for a long time.Your dad tells you something like that and you believe it.But then, I found hockey and I was good at it.And that determined your worth?The question blew him sideways for a second, but he shook his head.No, I did.I worked hard.Harder than anyone else.I work hard, she said, and he nodded.It takes guts to be good at something.Confidence that you know you can do it.Its not enough that I sweat through the workouts, that I train harder than anyone else.I have to work through the sprains and shake off the bad hits.I have to ignore the slumps and the off nights, and I cant let all the damn parasites get in my head with their endless chatter about how old I am.I cant listen to the doctors who tell me to retire.I cant give in to the fear that everyone is right.I have to believe in my worth.In what I am.She put a hand on his arm and he realized hed gotten lost in his own head.Im not trying to take hockey away from you.He looked over at her, her lithe body propped up against the counter, her legs crossed at the ankles, and suddenly he was ashamed by the way hed been treating her.As if she were there for his amusement, his sarcasm, anger, and junior high style seductions.And Im not trying to take your worth from you.He wished he could touch her.Take away the sting of every hurtful thing hed said.But that would negate everything she needed to believe.Youre so beautiful.Luc, she admonished, but he shook his head.Im not talking about your body, or the way you dress.Im talking about you.Youre smart and youre tough and I dont know a thing about you, but Im guessing life hasnt always been easy.The tension in her rippled through the air like heat waves off Texas asphalt.She wanted to run, it was obvious, but she didnt.Instead, almost imperceptibly, she nodded.The way Ive acted Dont worry, she breathed, waving him off, but he caught her hand, felt the fine bones of her wrists and fingers, relished the heat of her skin, and then he dropped it.No, demanding you kiss me, talking to you the way I haveits crap, Tara, and Im sorry.I would never have acted that way if I hadnt been sure you were as interested as I was, but thats a pretty shitty excuse and Im sorry.The sentence hung there.She didnt accept his apology, which frankly was her prerogative.And she didnt confirm or deny her interest.She just stood there in the moonlight, so beautiful he ached.He found the lid to the ice cream and pressed it back on and then he took the three steps to the freezer to put it away.But still she didnt say anything.He couldnt force her to talk.To accept his apology.Good night, Tara, he said.He was walking away.The gorgeous slope of his back gleamed in the moonlight like silver and he was walking away.Shed pushed a hundred guys away, watched dozens of men retreat from her barbs and her land mines.She should be celebrating, because Luc had been a difficult man to dissuade, but now, watching him go did something inside of her.Something lonely and cold, shivering in isolation, wailed a protest.It had been a long time since a man had seen past the act, pushed aside the curtain to see the person she kept hidden.And he seemed to want her more for her reality.And that was great and all, but standing in the dark kitchen, she wanted him.She wanted something that shed lost.Something that had been taken away from her a million times.Her power.The power this man made her feel, long after shed thought shed never feel it again.Im interested, she blurted.Inwardly, she shrank.Inwardly, she freaked right out.What the hell am I doing?But her mouth wouldnt stop talking and the loneliest part of her was steering the ship.Im interested.His smile illuminated the sharp planes of his face, creating softness where shed never seen it.He was happy, she realized, feeling as if her chest might explode from the combustible nature of every single conflicting emotion at work.But LucLuc was boyish in his happiness.Sweet.And it took her breath away.She closed the distance between them, wishing his happiness might seep under her skin, set off a similar reaction in her.Im glad.His fingers traced her eyebrows, the curl of her ear.Tenderly, he kissed her lips, sending her sighing into a hot internal place.Good night, Tara.He stepped back and that hot internal place was doused.Whatwhat are you doing?Going to bed.Im thinking it might be better if we didntact on this interest right now.Better for who?Both of us.Look, Tara, its not easy to walk away right now, but its not like we started this on the right foot.Id like toI dont knowtake you on a date or something.No.She didnt want to date.She wanted to feel good.She wanted that happiness on his face to rub off on her.Now.Right now.Banishing every scent of Dennis on her skin.Now?She nodded.Really?His voice all but cracked, and she smiled as she stepped toward him.Really.Slowly, she put her fingers on his arm, her body rejoicing in his heat.His strength and life.She spread out her hand, covering as much of his skin as possible.Hes so big, she thought, excited by his size.His power.He ran his hands over her hair, down the strong lines of her back, and she curled under his touch, a flower seeking sunshine.I was told I was worthless too, she said, the words sticky in her mouth.But shed opened the door and suddenly, with this man, she wanted to go through it.My whole life.My mom.My moms boyfriends.I grew up in a trailer on the wrong side of every track in the world.And then I got breasts.And hips.And suddenly I wasnt worthless anymore.I had something people wanted.How old were you?Nothing about him conveyed pity.He was nothing but stalwart understanding and sympathy, and her heart swelled.Twelve.Tara Theyre just breasts, Luc.She smiled, but it didnt quite cover up the old pain like it used to, so she looked away, smoothing her hand down his chest.The kitchen was quiet; the sound of his breathing and the echo of her blood pounding in her ears were all she heard.I dont know why youre doing this, he whispered.And part of me doesnt care.But I have to know its for the right reasons.I would hateI would hate to take advantage of you and not know it.So you need to tell me, Tara.Why?Sex stopped being fun for me a long time ago, she said.So I stopped having it.Thats a shame.Sex should always be fun.Her eyes perused the muscles of his chest, deciding where to start.Her fingers, long and delicate, followed.Skating across his collarbones, down the rounded curve of his pecs.Muscles and nerves twitched under her touch.She dipped down to the hard plain of his breastbone to his abs, her fingers riding the ridges of muscle until she landed at the waistband of his shorts.He shook beneath her touch and she delighted in it.Was empowered.Ill bet it is with you.She lifted her fingers, pausing, smiling at his torture, and then started the downward path all over again at his shoulder.His breath hitched in his lungs as she found the small valley between his deltoid and bicep, and the muscles flexed and jumped.Is that what this is?he asked.You want to have fun?Is that wrong?No, but I dont think its the whole truth.Maybe thats the only truth Im going to tell you, she said.His laughter stroked her, feathered her hair, and his hand followed.Is it about the bonus?No.That line was drawn in concrete.Its about me.Its about wanting something and taking it.Its about being tired of being alone and cold and untouched.Its about feeling something good after a long, long time of feeling nothing.Slowly he nodded, his hands stroking her hair, the line of her back, and then they slipped to his side.He stood in front of her, a mountain of strength that he would never use against her.Im whatever you need, Tara, he breathed.Take what you want.15 Eves dilemma with that apple suddenly made sense to Tara Jean in a whole new way.Here was Luc, a bad idea on so many levels, but tempting on just as many.And all that strength she used to have, all that denial and restraint that had lived at her fingertips for the last four years, were nowhere to be found.Hunger, selfish and horny, was running the show.And Luc, in the moonlight, against the fridge, his hands in fists at his side as if they were going to engage in a little bondage, looked like a particularly juicy apple.Yep, she totally sympathized with Eve.Slowly, she leaned against him.Her chest and stomach met his in a hundred little delicious soft spots, her arms slipped over his shoulders, her lips hovered over his like a honeybee.Tara, he breathed, his lips curling into one of the most pained smiles shed ever seen.Poor man, she thought and carefully, as if either of them might break at the contact, she put her lips to his.She tilted her head, opened her lips, and tasted him.The sweet corner of his lips where chocolate lingered.His salty upper lip, where he was sweating despite the cool air conditioning.His mouth opened and she tasted his tongue, chocolate and toothpaste and something else.Something Luc, and it was sweeter even than the ice cream.And deeply, wickedly spicy.She stepped closer, her hips finding the cradle of his, and he jerked against her, his hands lifting for a second.She held her breath, wondering where those hands would fall, waiting for his touch with electric anticipation.But then he put his hands back to his sides, his muscles tight and hard beneath her touch.It seemed like he had taken all her restraintmade it his own.She lifted her head, drawing out the kiss as long as she could, sucking on his tongue, feeling him grow harder and hotter against her belly.It was gonna be good, whatever was coming her way, it was going to be very, very good.You gonna touch me?She looked into his hooded eyes, rubbed the silk of his hair between her fingers.You want me to?She smiled, feeling coy.Feeling girlish and wise at the same time, and it was exhilarating.It would be nice.II dont want to do anything you dont want.A gentleman, honestly.She was sucking his tongue, pressing the seam of her jeans as hard as she could against the impressive erection she felt beneath those workout shorts.Most men of her acquaintance wouldnt be waiting for anything as mundane as permission.They probably wouldnt even wait to take their pants off.Thats why hes special, she thought.Thats why you cant resist him anymore.Somehow, one of the good guys had wandered onto this ranch.Into her arms.Which only meant, in the end, that he was even more rare and extraordinary.More forbidden.Because shed not once in her life done anything to deserve a good guy.This was her moment with the apple.And she was going to take a bite.Theres nothing I dont want right now, she whispered.Touch me.He growled and came off the fridge like a freight train.On a lesser man, the growl would have been ridiculous.But on him it fit, and her body organized a cheerleading squad in his honor.He lifted her as if she were weightless, his hands cupping her butt, sliding her onto the tiled island in the middle of the kitchen.His fingers, nimble and light, climbed her ribs, stroking the skin beneath the thin pink T shirt she wore.The hidden switch in her neck that controlled every bell and whistle in her bodythe ones she knew about and the ones shed never dreamed she hadhe found with his full lips, his clever tongue.She shook against him, every pleasure receptor thrown open.She put her hands on his face, her fingers gripping his hair until he lifted his head and she kissed him.She kissed him as if she wanted to swallow him.Eat him alive.He was pleasure, he was bliss and joy, and shed forgotten how much she loved this dark thrill, how good it made her feel.How sex could push away everything that was wrong, everything she didnt want to deal with.She could wallow in sex, swim in its eddies for days.Ignore the problems and mistakes that were growing like weeds in her life.And she could do that now.Luc could make her forget Dennis and the money and his threats about Victoria.He could make her forget how alone she was.How scared she was of failing.How success felt like something that happened to other people.Not to her.Never to her.Hey, he breathed, pulling away.Whats the rush?The fire was out of control in her body, her head was spinning with desire, and she felt the way she used to, years ago, as though this heat, this pleasure, was all she had.The only thing she had to give.The only thing that gave her worth.For a moment she froze.I am not that woman anymore, she thought.I dont want to be that woman.Shed worked hard to put Jane behind her.Mistakes, a thousand mistakes littered her past, brought to bear usually because shed decided to be selfish.Lazy.Trust some man because he made her feel good.Wanted.This is a mistake, she thought.Tara?Luc whispered, his lips feathering across her cheeks.She didnt say anything and he blinked up at her, shifting backward, taking his heat away from her, and she tightened her legs around his hips to stop him.Her body speaking for her.You all right?he asked, smoothing her hair back off her face, leaving her bare and revealed.He was so beautiful and so ready to step away and she realized, all that power that had been taken away from herhalf the time shed tossed it away.Handed it out like it was nothing.She deserved the pleasure as much as she deserved the power.It was a matter of balance, of living in the space between reckless and alone.And there was plenty of space there.She could build a house.Im good, she said.Tonight, she had no interest in being alone.And being with Luc wasnt reckless.This moment established the balance.Stepping into this place, this considered and adult place, felt wildly different.It was as if shed suddenly grown new skin.Or was wearing someone elses.Im really good.Kiss me.His grin was wicked and those devilish lips pressed a chaste kiss to her cheek.The corner of her lips.He leaned down and kissed the dip between her collarbones.His lips seared her skin, cauterizing any thoughts of the past.And then he licked her, leaving a trail of sparks across her skin, the tops of her breasts.Sweat ran down his chest, onto hers, making her shirt stick to both of them.His fingers traced the lace edge of her bra, as if scouting foreign boundaries.She opened her mouth against his neck, tasting the salt, testing the skin with her teeth, begging him to touch her, to slide that hand against her breast.Waiting, she breathed him in.His eyes met hers and the moment filled with a thousand pleasures.The heat of his hand slipped past the silk of her bra, his thumb caught the edge of her nipple, pulling it, and she gasped, caught in the web between pleasure and pain.Her heartbeat pounded between her legs and she arched hard against him, all those years of celibacy suddenly making her frantic with expectation.The seam of her jeans hit her just right and she shook, desires edge turning sharp.Come on, she breathed, slipping her fingertips under the elastic waist at the back of his shorts, pulling him harder against her.His skin there was so smooth and she spread her hands wide to feel as much of it as she could.She didnt have time to wait for him to get around to what she needed.Knowing Luc, hed toy with her until she lost her mind, and she already had a head start on that.She took his hand and slid it down the trembling muscles of her belly to the button on her jeans.This is what I want, she whispered.Make me come.Oh God, Tara, he groaned and curled over her, his body a protective shell they lived in, the world outside of no interest.His fingers made quick work of the button and zipper.She dropped her legs from around his waist and arched her hips, helping him find his way into the tight wedge between her pants and skin.His forehead pressed hard against hers and two callused fingers slipped through the curls between her legs.She was stretched taut between his forehead and his fingers, a bow ready to be released, and when his fingers found the tight knot of her clitoris she jerked and hummed, her hands clutching at his skin, her mouth open against his neck.Yes, she whispered.Yes, yes, yes.A hundred times she sighed against him, an incantation to pleasure.Her hips jerked as he found a rhythm, and the pleasure was so sharp it hurt and it had been so long.So long.She twitched, trying to get closer and get away at the same time.Nerves all along her feet and up her legs, across her hips, circling her breasts, heated and the sensation was too much.Too much to take, and she grabbed his hand.I She looked up at him through sweaty bangs and forgot what she was going to say.Stop?Was she nuts?Too much?he breathed.She nodded, feeling foolish and so turned on she couldnt think.His lip curled.Lets try this.He picked her up from the island and set her on her feet.Slowly he turned her so her back was braced against his chest and her hands were spread wide against the colorful Mexican tiles of the island that was still warm from the heat of her body.His hands slid over her hips, pushing her jeans and her silky pink underwear down to her knees.His hands ran back up to her thighs, the curves of her butt.The pleasure returned, a great wave of it, but without the jagged edges.It just lifted her up and when he pressed against her back with the heat of his chest, she leaned forward, her head hanging in surrender.Her hair slipped over her cheeks, a curtain shielding her from the night, the kitchen, the mistakes she was undoubtedly making.But his breath was a hot wind at the back of her neck.Again, she felt his fingers between her legs, but he slipped right past the knot of nerves that were too sensitive, to the deep well of her body.His finger slid in and she sagged, caught between him and the countertop, so supported she didnt even need her legs.Couldnt even feel them, really.Youre so wet, Tara Jean.So hot.I cant wait to taste you.She cried out at his words, and he put teeth to her neck and she writhed against him.Another finger joined the first.Retreated.Surged forward.He lifted her up, holding her tummy in his giant hand so his fingers could get deeper.His thumb grazed her clitoris and she shattered, exploded against his body, and still he kept at her, working her, his fingers finding darker spots, secret places where pleasure was just waiting for someone to find it.She exploded again, feeling as if her body wasnt even hers.Wouldnt be hers ever again.Not the way she knew it.Her skin evaporated and her body flew apart and he didnt give her a chance to pull herself together, to keep herself in line.There had to be restrictionslimits to this pleasure, to what shed let him do to her.But he didnt seem to understand that.His hand slipped up from her stomach to her breasts, his touch so soft it barely registered in the explosion of pleasure.As if he knew that, as if he were inside her body, he squeezed, he found her nipple and pulled.Sharp and hot, the pleasure started again, a steep incline she had no control over.Luc.She heard the tangled trepidation in her own voice and hated it.Shhhh, he breathed against her hair.Let me make you feel good.Like you wanted.One more time, Tara.He spun her, shifted her, and then, before she could stop him, before she could close her eyes and block out the sight, this big, beautiful man was on his knees in front of her.His tongue, his fingers, the soft suction of his lips.She shook her head, the edge coming, the bright expanse on the horizon rushing closer.She lifted her legs, shifted her back, trying to keep a hold of herself, to dull the pleasure to a level she knew, one she was comfortable with.But he controlled her every string like a puppet master.I got you, Tara, he whispered against the electric pulsing center of her body.I got you.Youre safe.Safe?Was he nuts?She opened her mouth to tell him he couldnt keep her safe.Not really.For her there was no such thing as safe.But he sucked on the hard edge of her clitoris and she shattered.Oh!she yelled and he stood, lifted his hand to cover her mouth.Oh my God!The words were muffled against his palm and she tasted the salt of his skin, felt the rough calluses against her tongue, and the sensations grounded her, helped her find the long way back to herself.In the silence of the kitchen the refrigerator kicked on and she jumped as if a gun had gone off.Despite the languor that floated along her bloodstream, induced by his fingers, his touch and kiss, she turned herself away from him.His fingers slipped out of her body, and she twitched at their exit.They left a damp trail across her hips and she shook at the earthy reminder.You all right?His breath ruffled the hair at her temple.He stood behind her, a solid wall to rest against, not that she did.Instead she held herself stiff in the cage of his arms, keeping her distance, too late of course, but she tried.All right?she thought and the answer from every part of her body was no.Absolutely not.Finally, she stepped sideways, her chest heaving, her skin twitching.His fingertips danced over her shoulder, the skin of her neck where her T shirt had been pulled aside.She wanted to go home.That was the result of all that pleasure.She wanted to leave him, without a word.Without turning around to see his face.She was raw.Far too raw to turn and flirt and take off her clothes.Tara Jean Sweet couldnt keep up the pretense.Wasnt even sure in this moment what was real and what was part of the act.Hilarious how adult shed felt just minutes ago.Reasonable.As though she could handle whatever he was going to do to her because she said so.She was tough.Shed seen every side of the sex coin.Another one of my stupid theories, she thought.Because shed never seen this coming.Time stretched on and she couldnt find the courage to face him.To face what theyd done.As if he could read her regrets and misgivings written on the bones of her shoulder, just under the thin skin he touched, he took his hand away.She closed her eyes.Gently, he pulled up her underwear and then her pants, and the gesture was so tender, tears clogged the back of her throat.She was lying to him.About Dennis.About who she was.And right now, picking herself up from the shattered remains of her act, of the game she played, raw and twitching in the sunlight of all that pleasure, she wasnt even sure who she was.She heard him shift, felt the air between them cool as he stepped away on bare feet.Go.His voice rough and deep and full of reproach and worry and a thousand other things she didnt want to turn and see on his face.She slid past him and ran out of the kitchen.Sweat burned Lucs eyes, and cold air froze his lungs.His legs were putty on his skates, his ankles wobbly.Stars sparkled in the corner of his eyes, obliterating the boards in his periphery.But still he worked.He worked.Leg over leg, skating in a line, he shifted backwards.The puck was on a string and the net went by in a blur; still backwards he skated toward center ice.At the crease he spun, lifted the stick, an extension of his arm, his hipshis goddamned dick.The puck was a rocket, snagged by the high left corner of the net.He retrieved it.Leg over leg, backwards again.The sparkles gathered force in the corners of his vision, grew teeth, grew ugly.His head swam, distanced, suddenly from the rest of him.And his legs slowed, his heart lurched.The boards covered with ads for a local used car dealership were close and then unexpectedly closer.And then he was in them, hips first.And his stomach was in his throat.He dropped his stick, shook off his gloves, and pawed at his chin strapGod, he couldnt breathe.Couldnt even see past the blinding wall of shine in front of his face.His head hurt so bad he felt it in his knees.He braced himself against the boards.You all right?The voice belonged to a kid, probably the same kid Luc had noticed sitting up in the bleachers, watching his workouts.He had a fairly good idea the kid was Randys, and since he never got in the way, only watched, Luc didnt bother to say anything.Luc?Fine, he said, though he knew that he wasnt, not really.You Luc pushed off the boards, skating away from the kid.Twenty minutes later, exhausted, his blood still pumping hard in his veins, he stepped into the private shower the manager let him use and cranked on the hot water.Tara Jean was still taking up center ice in his head and that workout hadnt done anything to take the edge off his hunger for her.The all consuming, totally humbling desire he had for a woman who had walked away from him.Get it together, Luc, he muttered and grabbed the soap from the ledge.Hot water hit the tiles and erupted in steam, and soon the shower was more like a steam bath and he couldnt see his feet.His legs.He turned to face the water, letting the jets hit the sorest of the muscles in his chest, the tops of his shoulders.It ran down his back, over his ass and legs.Tilting his head back, he closed his eyes and let the water pour over his face.In the dark and the heat, his body hungry, he thought of Tara.
