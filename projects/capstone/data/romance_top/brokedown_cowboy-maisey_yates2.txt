It would just be nice to have someone around the house to do hard labor when Tom is out on the boat.I could really start something here.A nice little secondary career.Liss stuck the papers she was holding into a file.Of course, I think living with Connor is going to be my secondary career.If its rent free...It is.And comes with a very handsome roommate, Jeanette said, smiling.Yes.A cranky, high maintenance, handsome roommate.Thats what they call a fixer upper.I think when I put out my ad for my mail order husband, Im going to request a man whos turnkey.Jeanette laughed.Good luck with that.They all come with baggage.Even the good ones.She pushed a couple buttons on her computer then paused.Actually, especially the good ones.Its the ones who have been through a lot and come out the other side that are really worth it in the end.Liss let Jeanettes words hang there for a moment, willing them to just roll off, hoping they wouldnt sink in.Because she didnt need to harbor any more false hope where Connor was concerned.Finally, she responded.Great.Ill let you know when he comes out the other side.Although, it still wont be like that.Whatever you say, Liss.Whatever you say.Lisss cell phone vibrated against the surface of her desk.Her landlords number flashed over the screen and she frowned, answering the phone as quickly as possible.Sorry, she said to Jeanette, grabbing the phone and picking it up, answering quickly.Hello?Hi, Liss?Marjorie asked, before plowing into the rest of her sentence.Our buyer is very motivated to move.In fact, they really need a place to stay, so if we cant clear out the house fast enough for them, they might look somewhere else.Theyre able to pay cash, so theyre very mobile, and this is moving very quickly.Im sorry to inconvenience you, but if you are able to move out as quickly as possible, I would really appreciate it.I know what your rights are legally, but I thought I would just talk to you personally.Of course, because this was Copper Ridge, and your landlord was never just your landlord; they became your friend, too.So when they overasked of you, it was impossible to say no.That was the economy of a small town.Everyone knew they could borrow help if need be, and interest was paid in small favors and homemade pies.But then, her landlord had not become a good enough friend to refuse to ask something like this of Liss.Of course, she also knew Marjorie would never push or throw her out on the street or anything.It just so happens that I lined up a place to stay last night.And I can move in whenever.She thought of Connor and his house, and her stomach did something weird.Kind of a twist and turn at the same time.Marjorie breathed out an audible sigh of relief right into Lisss ear.If you could start moving out this weekend, it would be really helpful.I just dont want the sale to fall through.Norm and I are much better off in Arizona, and the sooner we can cut ties with everything here, the better.It isnt that I dont love the town, but my joints dont love the damp.I understand.Even though she didnt, really.Thank you, Liss.Youve been a great tenant.Most especially since Marshall had moved out, but Liss didnt say it.Most especially since that boyfriend of yours moved out.Oh, so Marjorie was going to go ahead and say it.I hate to lose you, but Im just too old to be managing properties and going back and forth between places.And if we have to hire a company...Liss let her mind wander.Shed heard Marjories hand wringing on the subject already.She was agreeing to move out; she didnt know why she needed to subject herself to her landlords woes.Which was potentially a little bit unsympathetic, but she was the one who was being massively inconvenienced, so maybe not.Okay, sweetie, Ive got to go, Marjorie said.Okay, talk to you later.Liss hung up and set her phone on the table.She looked up at Jeanette.Is it okay if I make one more personal call?Jeanette waved a hand.Im not the warden.Do your business.Liss picked her phone up and dialed Connors cell phone number.He still had a flip phone, and half the time it didnt ring, but it was still worth a try, because she knew he was out in the field right now, rather than at home.Much to her very pleasant surprise, Connor answered on the second ring.Liss?Hi, Connor.I just wanted to say...I guess Im moving in this weekend.I guess Ill be at your house early Saturday with a truck.He sounded a little bit dazed, and she couldnt blame him.She felt a little bit dazed.Ill be waiting.With groceries.As per the agreement.All right, then, Saturday.Saturday, she repeated, before hanging the phone up.It wasnt that big of a deal.It wasnt a deal at all.Maybe if she repeated that to herself a few more times she would start to believe it.IT WAS MOVING DAY.Connor had to be at Lisss house by nine.Which meant hed been out on his horse by six.The morning air had a mean bite, but he didnt mind.The needle pokes of wind against his skin, combined with the pounding of his horses hooves on the soft ground, went a long way in wiping his mind clean.Connor rode through the empty field, clumps of mud and grass flying up behind him, hitting the back of his shirt.The clearing was flanked by a grove of trees on the left, and a steep, evergreen covered pitch of rock on the right.The sky above was filled with gray, misty clouds that seemed to be rolling down toward earth, swallowing the tops of the mountains that surrounded the ranch.This was morning here in Copper Ridge.All shades of deep green, blue and gray.Until the sun came out and burned the cloud cover away, flooding the ranch with golden light, drawing the scent of dirt, moss, pine out, then washing it all with an ocean breeze.For Connor this was as close to spiritual as it got.Being in this place, this town, where vast stretches of water met vast open land.Where all the essential sources of life were ready and available.This place was in his blood, in his soul.This land had been here before him, before his family had fenced it, cultivating it, but never taming it.To the best of his ability he would see it was here long after he was gone.In his mind, progress could never mean man made development on land like this.Progress would be when people realized that everything they needed was already here.He ignored the hollow ache in his stomach that was trying to remind him even here, even now, he felt a little bit empty.That even now, with the golden sunlight poured over the evergreen trees, he felt cold down to his soul.That no matter how bright the light shone, it never seemed to touch him.He ignored that, because there was nothing he could do with it.He pulled back on the reins, bringing his horse to a stop, taking a moment to survey his surroundings.It was still here.It was early enough in the morning that even the wind was still.It was the kind of vast silence that would swallow up the sound of a mans voice, consuming it as if he had never spoken.One man wasnt powerful enough to disturb beauty like this.It made him feel small, and consequently it made some of his problems feel a lot smaller.He dismounted from his horse, dropping the reins and leaving her standing there.He walked forward, toward the middle of the clearing, and looked up.For the first time he saw a small patch of blue sky, a ray of sun bursting through.He closed his eyes, keeping his face angled upward, letting the warmth seep through his skin, praying it would reach his bones.It didnt.But it hit him just then that this was the first morning he had woken up without a hangover in quite a while.He hadnt had a drink last night.Hed been too focused on what it would mean to bring Liss into the house.He opened his eyes and looked at the sun, and his head didnt hurt.All things considered, he figured it would be a pretty good moving day.* * * THEYD ATTACKED THE PROJECT of moving Liss much like a barn raising.All hands on deck, finished by the end of the day.Ultimately, nothing was left undone except for a few empty boxes still in need of disposal, and paper plates with the remnants of pizza, along with a few empty beer bottles, stationed throughout Connors house.Of course, there hadnt been much to move into the house itself.A bedrooms worth of furniture, and all her clothes, books and a few kitchen gadgets she hadnt been willing to part with.Everything else had gone into a vacant outbuilding on the Garrett property.Which was going to save her a lot in storage fees.Between letting her borrow space on the ranch, space in Connors house and the use of their musclesincluding JacksLiss was starting to feel as if she was taking an awful lot.And that feeling, that feeling of being in debt to somebody else, always made her feel uncomfortable.She felt as though it forced her to keep a running tally on what she had contributed versus what someone else had contributed.Because she never wanted to be on the wrong side of that balance.She took a deep breath and tried to banish the tightness in her chest.The moving crew, comprised of Eli, Sadie, Kate, Jeanette and Jack, had all gone home, leaving her there in her new space, with her new roommate.She took a deep breath and walked over to the kitchen sink, looking out at the wall of trees that stood between the house and the mountains.It didnt feel weird to be here.Of course, she didnt know why she had thought it might.Well, she supposed it was because she was living here now, instead of visiting.But then, she was much more than a casual visitor.Always had been.Even more so in recent years.Because she was bringing him food, having dinner with him, trying to prevent him from drinking himself into a stupor every night, which she had managed with mixed success.It didnt feel weird at all to be standing here.No, it felt comfortable.This would be comfortable.Yes, comfortable.Like a broken in pair of boots.Like a late July afternoon on the hiking trails that wound through the mountains and beneath a canopy of trees.That kind of comfy.She heard footsteps behind her, and she turned.Connor shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans and rocked back on his heels.You need anything?he asked.No.Still full from the pizza.I know theres no bathroom right off your bedroom.But I figure you can have that one thats nearby in the hall.I only use the one off my bedroom.Shed kept all of her toiletries in her travel case.She just hadnt felt comfortable unloading makeup and hair care products all over a common area.There was moving in, and then there was invading.Only if youre sure.I dont mind keeping that stuff in my room.No way.Thats not practical at all.Just unload it all in there.As far as Im concerned this is your place, too.I mean, its mainly my place, but were sharing.Seventy thirty.She laughed.Generous.Yeah, I think so.Come on, though.This place is huge.I basically have a trail worn between my bedroom and the kitchen, and I hardly go anywhere else.I spend most of my day outside working.Of course, that means I barely clean any room in the house, so Im sorry about that.Well, I kept my house clean.I have no problem transferring that to here.Honestly, you have no idea how much Ive been wanting to wipe down your cabinets.A lopsided smile curved his mouth.That kind of sounds dirty.Wiping down your cabinets?she asked, barely suppressing a grin.I dont even want to know what that could be.Do you know what I want?She narrowed her eyes.What?Pie.That had better not be euphemistic pie.The line of conversation was making her feel strange.A little bit light headed.No, this is literal pie.He walked to the fridge and opened the door, pulling out a white bakery box and setting it on the island in the center of the kitchen.Remember Alison?She made those pies for the Fourth of July thing.You know, then my barn burned down and Eli ran her husband off the property.Oh, yes, I vaguely remember that night, she said drily.Anyway, shes selling pies independently, not just baking for the diner.Because she left her husband right after the thing.Did she?Yep.So I hear from Sadie.Its not the kind of gossip I would keep up on on my own.He opened the box and shrugged a shoulder.Still, I figure its nice to help support someone starting a new life.Connor being Connor, he was downplaying anything even remotely nice about what he had done.Thats very thoughtful of you, she said, moving closer to examine the dessert that was in the box.I got pie in exchange for my good deed.I think that nullifies the good deed.My reward is pie.And what variety of pie are we talking?Marionberry.Excellent reward.Do you have ice cream?Connor looked up at her, handsome face contorted into an expression of horror.And whipped cream.I know I might seem uncivilized, but even I have some boundaries.Youre a god among men, Connor Garrett.You have saved me from homelessnessor at least living with my motherand youve given me pie.You can begin paying me back by getting out some plates, he said.Will do.She made herself busy getting out plates, ice cream and the whipped cream, which was in the fridge as promised.Apparently, Connor could grocery shop when dessert was involved.Well, dessert or alcohol.She brought the plates over, and Connor put one piece on each, a very generous sized piece, because Connor knew she didnt mess around with desserts.He didnt even ask if she wanted the pie warm, because he knew better than that.He put each piece in the microwave for about thirty seconds, and when they were done, she was waiting with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for each.They both dove right into their pie, eating wordlessly, exchanging looks during bites.This is good, Liss said when she was halfway through with her piece.Understatement, Connor said around a mouthful.I dont even know why we bothered to put pieces on the plates.We shouldve just eaten straight out of the box.Because it takes longer to heat up a whole pie?Yeah, good point.Lisss thoughts turned to Alison.So, is Alison still working at the diner?Search me, Connor said.I just know shes trying to make a business out of the baking.Its hard to start over.You would know.Its not really the same.Sure it is, she said, taking another bite as if she could stuff her statement right back into her mouth.She should not be pushing him on this topic, and she knew that.No, its not the same.She was married to an asshole.She very rightly chose to end that marriage, and because of that finds herself with increased options in life.I didnt make any choices about changing my life.It just changed.But you could make some now.She did not say that out loud.Fine.But you are still in a new chapter of your life.I should have put that book down a few chapters ago, then.Called it good.Lisss stomach pitched.I really hope that wasnt supposed to mean what I think it did.Right now she was ready to hit him in the face with her pie plate.What do you think it meant?I hope you dont think you shouldve stopped living.Because I dont want to think about that.Connor, Jessie was one of my best friends.I know it isnt the same as being married to somebody.I do.But I cant think about losing you, too.I just cant.I cant lose both of you.Thats not what I meant, Liss.I didnt really mean anything by it.Dont say things you dont mean.Sorry, honey.I guess you missed the memo about me being a gigantic bastard.Liss sighed.You are not a bastard.You do a very good impression of one, but I know you arent one.Case in point, I am standing in your kitchen with you eating dessert.Your kitchen, that is now my kitchen, too.Because you gave me a place to stay when I needed one.Because you are actually kind of a kick ass friend.And a good man who buys charitable pies.So enough with the bastard talk.I think youre the only one who still thinks Im decent, but Ill take it.Her eyes met his, dark, enticing, with a hint of bitterness, like a coffee bean.Her heart squeezed tight, and she looked down.She didnt know why this happened sometimes.Why she could stand there and talk to him and feel perfectly appropriate, neutral friendship feelings that she would have while speaking to someone like Jeanette.And then suddenly she would look at him, and things would change.Her breath would catch in her throat, her heart doing tricks.And in those moments he was the furthest thing from just a friend.In those moments he wasnt just anything.He was everything.You are more than decent.And dont argue with me.Anyway, maybe we should talk about what I can help you with around here?Youre very effectively helping me demolish this pie.Thats appreciated.I will be sure to add pie demolition to my rsum.But beyond helping you reduce the snack foods in your house, Id like to help.Cleaning for sure, because that benefits me, too.I already do your accounting.But if theres any other paperwork that you have, Id be happy to help.I know that Jessie used to handle a lot of the admin.She had already invoked Jessies name once in the past few minutes so she might as well do it again.Yeah, Im pretty behind on some things, I cant lie about that.Connor braced his hands on the island, and her gaze was drawn to them.He had nice hands.Strong, square, masculine.He had never worn a wedding ring all that often.The kind of work that he did made the little gold band a hazard.More than one rancher had lost a finger by getting a wedding ring caught on an animal or a tractor.But she was still surprised that hed taken it off and never put it back on again.In so many other ways she could see he was holding on tightly to the past, but not in that way.Of course, that wasnt something you asked about.He sighed heavily.I would like to lie about that.I pretty much do lie about it to Eli.But whats the point of lying to him?He would just want to help.Yeah, thats the thing.He wouldnt be able to help himself.He would jump right in.And then he would resent me for it.And its not the resentment Id mind so much, its the fact that he should have his own life.And I shouldnt be interfering in it with all of my shit.Hes your brother, though.Your shit is his shit.Its been that way for too long, Liss.Im not going to do that to him anymore.He has Sadie now, and I just know hes going to marry her.Hes got to make a family with her.And he should be free to do that.Hes been dealing with other peoples messes for way too long.I dont need him to do it with mine.Thats what family does.We clean up each others messes, because its better to do that than to not have family at all.At least that was what she often told herself, because Madeleine Foster was a mess and a half.And Liss had spent a very good portion of her life cleaning up those messes.She was all in trying to keep her mother happy.Trying to prove her worth.But over the past few years it had started to wear on her.It was an insatiable well she could continue to pour into forever and never satisfy.Never get the one thing she was actually after.Thats why youre good family to have.She wondered for a second if he was going to hug her again, like hed done the other day.Stupid, but that hug was burned into her consciousness.There had been something about it, something that differentiated it from the hugs theyd shared before.It had left her warm and a little bit breathless.Or, more to the point, it had left her a little bit turned on.Shed had a very restless night that night.All things considered, she really shouldnt want another hug from him.But she did.Base creature that she was.It was sort of the story of her life.Stealing a few cheap thrills now and again from innocuous Connor contact.Oh, she didnt mean to.She didnt mean to let sparks fly through her veins when his fingers brushed against hers, didnt mean to go weak kneed when he smiled and caught her eyes.It was involuntary.And unnecessary.But it happened all the same.Well, Im happy to be your family.She took a step backward, just in case he did intend to hug her.She needed to curb that before it happened.Because sanity.Because even though her reactions to him were involuntary, and in some ways not entirely unpleasant, it did not mean she had to encourage them.Because, as he just said, he felt all familial toward her.And it was what he needed from her.He did not need her getting gooey over hugs.If you could leave me a list of things you want to look at tomorrow, Ill go over it when I get up in the morning and get started.I dont want you to spend your Sunday doing chores for me.And I want to start as I mean to go on.These are chores.I want to help you.I think Ive made that perfectly clear by showing up once every couple of weeks with groceries.And by bringing you food so you dont starve and die.You were sharing that responsibility with Eli.Sure.But I called and reminded him most of the time.Anyway, just leave me a list, and tomorrow Ill get started.Okay, but Im afraid youre going to regret this a little bit.She laughed.Maybe.But thats future Lisss problem.Present Liss is going to skip off to bed with a full stomach and not worry about it.He shook his head.Fine, but when future Liss becomes present Liss shes going to be cursing past Liss.Maybe.But Ill worry about that tomorrow.Yes, this was going to be comfortable.Comfortable, indeed.And as Liss settled into her new bedroom, she knew that she had made the right decision.She was going to be just fine.BY THE TIME Connor got back to the house Sunday night he was tired, dirty and grumpier than a bear with his ass stuck in a beehive.All he wanted to do was grab a beer, sit in front of the TV and pass out.The damn cows had collapsed the fence on the far end of the property and had ended up scattering into BLM land.It had taken multiple four wheelers and men to get the craven beasts back where they belonged.Steak.He wanted steak.That was the other thing he wanted.He had a feeling it wasnt a coincidence, considering how obnoxious the damn cows were.He remembered the list he had left on the counter for Liss that morning, and he perked up slightly.With any luck, the kitchen would be cleaner, and his paperwork would be done.And probably, just because she was Liss, she wouldve made dinner, too.After all, she had to eat, and she had worked all day.By the time he walked through the entryway and into the kitchen he was almost smiling.But there was no warm, inviting smell of a home cooked dinner.Neither was Liss in the kitchen, prancing around in an apron and high heels.He had no idea why he was picturing her wearing that, since he had never seen her wear any such thing; he only knew he had pictured it.What he had not imagined was Liss storming into the kitchen, barefoot, and wearing jeans and a T shirt, scowling at him like hed just voiced his desire to have found her cooking in high heels out loud.We need to talk.Do we?he asked, walking to the fridge, opening it, hunting for a beer.He was in trouble, and he wasnt sure why.He was rarely in trouble with Liss, and Lord knew he had probably earned some that she had never doled out.But as far as he knew he hadnt done anything wrong today.In fact, all he had done today was work hard and come home to a frowning woman.That was one thing about marriage he had not missed.Yes, we do.I was doing that paperwork that you asked me to take care of.He arched a brow.You got a paper cut?I wish, Connor, I wish.I told you it was going to be a pain.You said you wanted to do it.The thing is, Connor, it was not a pain.She was saying his name a lot.The amount of times she used his name in a sentence seemed directly related to how pissed she was.Connor, it took me about five minutes to deal with.There were just a few things that needed to be clarified and refilled out.In order for you to get your insurance money.You got the paperwork more than a month ago.I saw the date that was stamped on it.Why didnt you send it?Well, that explained why he was in trouble.He hadnt realized a whole month had passed since hed last spoken with the claims office.But in his defense, he hadnt really thought it was a simple fix.In fact, every time he thought about doing it, a hard knot of stress started to form in his stomach, and he broke out into a cold sweat.So he went and did something else.Anything else.And okay, it might have been easier than hed imagined it would be, but there was no way it had taken her only a few minutes to do the task.I dont know, he said, because right then he honestly didnt.Thats not a very good answer.In fact, it isnt the answer.Its an answer.Its the only one I have.I dont know why I didnt finish it.It just...Every time I thought about doing it, I didnt.Connor, this is the only way youre going to get your barn built.You led me to believe, me and everyone else, that the insurance company was dragging their feet.But they didnt have all the paperwork because you didnt do it.I didnt ask you to get in my face about what you found in the house.I just asked you to take care of it.That too difficult?Liss crossed her arms beneath her breasts.Yes, it is too difficult.I want to understand whats going on.There isnt anything going on.I just didnt get it done.Thats bullshit, Connor.You even had it signed.You just needed to finish the body of the paperwork.All I had to do was fax it over today, and its being processed.It was that simple.It wasnt simple.He slammed the refrigerator door shut and dragged his fingers through his hair.Obviously, if it was simple I wouldve done it.But you didnt.Somehow, I managed.Yeah, well, he said, throwing his arms out, I guess I just wonder what the point is.Everything I build, every single thing, just ends up getting destroyed.If I get the money it would just burn, too.Or maybe I would rebuild the barn, and then what?Is it going to be safe?His heart was thundering hard, his hands feeling a little bit shaky.He hadnt realized the outburst was coming until it was over.But he realized, as soon as he had said the words, that they were true.This ranch had been in his family for generations.And if there was one thing every generation of Garretts had in common, it was loss.When they loved someone, that someone left.When they loved something, it got destroyed.Connor had loved a lot of things.He had added one major bit of himself to this operation, the barn, and it had burned to the ground.How many more signs from God did he need before he just stopped trying?A guy would have to be a damn hardheaded fool to not realize when things just werent going to grow where he planted them.You dont really think thats going to happen, do you?Liss asked, her eyes full of concern.Shed looked at him like that twice in the past couple of days.Like he was crazy, like she wanted to hug him and slap him at the same time.There are no guarantees.And she couldnt argue with him about that.Because he knew it was true.He knew it was true more than anyone.That barn was something that Jessie and I both wanted for this ranch.I dreamed about something like that.I hated that I had to get it through tragedy.With the money from my old man dying.Hell, who would want that?But I had it.Eli, Kate, they gave their share so that I could have that.So that we can take this ranch and make it better.And then Jessie died, and all of my plans went to shit.Because it doesnt matter anymore.It was hard to describe the kind of desolation he had felt when he lost Jessie.The way the future felt as if it had been erased.But then, there was more to all that than he could tell Liss.More to all of it than he could ever tell anyone.Because everyone had grieved with him over Jessies death.He didnt want to add to it.Connor, I know youve been through hell.I remember what a big deal it was to you to have that barn built in the first place.How bittersweet it was, because of your dad.I was there.I remember how excited you were, how excited Jessie was.I remember all of your plans.I know all of those dreams that you had are still somewhere inside of you.Pain washed over him, through him.Because he wished what she was saying was true.The simple fact was that those dreams were gone.Dead and buried.He was just doing his best to get through the day.To work the ranch.The fact that he got up every morning and did his work was about the only thing that separated him from his dad.The thought was like spikes of barbed wire pushed under his fingernails.He wasnt like his dad.Michael Garrett had checked out of his childrens lives completely when his wife had left.Leaving the ranch to rot, leaving his kids to take care of themselves, while he drank himself into a stupor on the couch.Connor took care of the ranch.Connor didnt have children to neglect.He rubbed his hand over his heart, trying to ease the intense pain that was spreading from there and moving outward.I dont really have dreams anymore, he said, feeling stupid talking about this.He wasnt the kind of guy to drag his feelings out into the open and examine them.He didnt even like to examine them by himself, under the cover of darkness.Thats not what I want for you, she said, her tone all sad and desperate.I cant...I cant.She looked down, blinking rapidly.Great, he had made Liss cry.Dont cry for me, Liss.I dont even cry for myself.Then somebody should cry for you, she said, looking back up at him, her eyes shining.No way.Cry over something thats worth it.Cry over puppies that are left in the pound, and ice cream scoops that fall off ice cream cones.But dont cry over me.I cant make any promises.Connor, the money is going to come soon now.Promise me that youll get the barn rebuilt.Or go to Hawaii.She closed her eyes and shook her head.No, get the barn rebuilt.Why, because Jessie wanted it?No, because you wanted it.He had wanted it, though he could barely remember wanting much of anything.Could barely remember being the man hed been three years ago, ready to start a new phase of his life, everything stretching ahead of him all bright and sunny and new.Instead of a wasteland of routine, of loneliness and grief that never seemed to ease no matter how much time passed, no matter how much he drank.Its hard to remember back that far.Or at least its difficult to remember why I cared.You cared because this ranch is in your blood.It still is, Connor.I know it is.Right now the ranch is just under my skin.I spent hours trying to get damn cows back into their pens.Not coincidentally I want to eat a hamburger.Liss clapped her hands together.Right.So lets make the hamburger happen.The question is, do we want to go to Aces?Or the diner?I sort of feel like throwing sharp things at a corkboard.So I vote for Aces.This was good.If they went out, there would be no more chance for talking.Because there would be too much laughing, and drinking and interacting with people who werent him.So Liss wouldnt be able to hold him under the microscope to the same degree she just had.Their conversation had gone to way too much of a navel gazing place.Liss pulled a bright pink rubber band from around her wrist and quickly swept her hair up into a ponytail.I should just go put some makeup on.What do you need makeup for?If the barn needs painting, you have to paint it, right?He stood and stared at Liss, standing there fresh faced, and damn pretty in his opinion, and puzzled over why she would need painting.Natural wood is good, too, he said, somewhat lamely.He was bad at complimenting people.He was out of practice.Not that hed been all that good at it even when he was in practice.Thank you, she said, her cheeks coloring a little bit.I think I will at least add a little bit of stain, though.I dont know.This metaphor has gotten weird.Okay, you go paint.Im going to hop in the shower because I smell.Ill only be about five minutes.* * * THE BAR WAS CROWDED, as per usual on a Sunday night.It was very likely most of the town had gone from church straight to drinking.But likely it was needed to get them through the workweek that lay ahead.But in spite of the impending doom of Monday, the atmosphere was exuberant.Country music was playing over the jukebox, almost every table filled, a small crowd gathered by the dartboards.Some people were still in coveralls, wearing the evidence of the days labor, while some were still in suits and ties, evidence of labor of a different sort.All the bits and pieces of Copper Ridge collided here, and it was easy to see why.The whole bar had a rustic feel to it, knotted wood on the floor and on the walls, exposed beams on the ceiling.There was half a red rowboat mounted to the ceiling, old fishing nets spilling out of it.It was everything a coastal hole in the wall needed.And, in defiance of its hole in the wall appearance, it had darn fine food.You know what you want?Connor asked.Fish and chips.Tartar sauce and malt vinegar.He nodded once.Snag a table, will you?Sure.Just a Diet Coke to drink.He nodded again, walking over to the bar.She couldnt help but watch him go.He had put on a plaid button up shirt, pushed the sleeves past his elbows, revealing that tattoo that fascinated her so much, and the muscles that fascinated her equally.Only Connor knew what the tattoo meant.Hed come back home one Saturday with the start of it and finished it over the next few weeks.But hed never said anything about it.And she had never asked.Because the omission was so glaring, it had to be purposeful.So she let him have it.But after today, she was starting to think she let him have a few too many omissions.Shed been livid when shed discovered the paperwork.But then hed said all those things, and her heart squeezed tight, and all the anger had sort of leaked out and drained away.And it was impossible to be mad at him now, as he was ordering her food and standing there with his broad back filling her vision, slim waist tapering down to slim hips and...Well, there was no use denying the fact that it was a damn fine ass.Her cheeks got hot, and she looked down at her hands.She was not going to keep staring at him.Not like that.She looked up again when he pulled his chair out and sat across from her.He set her Diet Coke down in front of her, his own hand wrapped around a dark brown beer bottle.Food will be up in a minute.Good, she said, Im starving.She looked up, behind Connor, and saw a group of three women, all bleached blonde, all much more made up than she was, staring Connor down.Blonde number one leaned over and whispered something to blonde number two, who then turned her focus to Liss, her frosted pink lip curling upward into a sneer.Well, Liss had clearly been measured and found wanting.Blonde number three tossed her hair over her shoulder and stuck her chest out, as if she was gearing up to go on a mission.And her mission seemed to pertain to Connor.Oh, dammit.They were headed this way.All of them were headed this way.They made their way up to the table, one moving to Connors left, the other two standing on his right.Hi.The one Liss had arbitrarily dubbed number three spoke first.My friends and I had a question.Connor looked up, a crease between his brows, his lips pulled down into a frown.Yes?He looked so confused, it was almost cute.We were just wondering if your table mate here is your girlfriend or your sister?Liss sputtered.Connors frown deepened.You came all the way over here to ask me that?Number three, whom Liss clearly shouldve named number one, reached out and touched Connors forearm.Ran her manicured fingertips over the vines of his tattoo.Rage burned in Lisss chest.Shed never done that.She had never touched his tattoo, and some random woman was trailing her fingertips over the ink on his skin.It seemed important, she said, winking at him.Her eyelashes were fake.Liss was certain.She lives with me, he said, turning his attention back to his beer.Doesnt really answer my question, Blondie said.I dont see why I should, he said, his tone uncompromising.The woman rolled her eyes and gestured to her friends to move on.Sorry you arent in the mood to play, honey, she said, her parting shot as she wiggled back over to the other side of the bar.Liss snorted.Can you believe that?What?Obviously, they did not think I was pretty enough to be your girlfriend.I dont see why they cared.She arched a brow.Do you really not see?He shook his head.Not really.Liss looked closely at his face to see if he was being serious.Because she was hitting on you.Now, I dont think my being your girlfriend wouldve deterred her, but I think she wanted to insult me first.He waved his hand.I doubt she was hitting on me.Yes, she was.Women must hit on you all the time.Maybe.He shrugged, the gesture more uncomfortable than casual.I dont really care.She should not be happy to hear that.She should be concerned.You dont care at all?Im not in the market for anything.That woman was not in the market for a relationship, Connor.She just wanted...you know, naked stuff.Im not really in the market for that right now.She should not be happy about that, and she should not be interested in exploring the topic further.Not at all?No.And dont try to change my mind.You said that you were going to support me being where I wanted to be.Eli has already pushed me about it.Jack wont shut up about it.I just...I figured...One of the new waitresses, someone Liss didnt know, set their food down in front of them.Both in red baskets, piled high with french fries.What did you figure?Connor asked, eating a fry.Well, I figured at this point you would be in the market for that.If you had not...gone to market already, so to speak.I dont have enough energy to fill out my insurance paperwork.Why would you think I had the energy to screw somebody?He took the top bun off his hamburger and started squirting ketchup on the patty.Her stomach twisted, and she did her best not to examine it.Because, typically, its something people make time for.She should talk, since shed been single for two years, and there had been no screwing.Connor shrugged and took a bite of his hamburger.I didnt come here to get a psychological evaluation.I came here to take out my rage on the cows by eating their brethren.So we can drop the subject now.He set the hamburger down and looked at his thumb, which had a spot of ketchup on it.He raised his thumb to his lips and licked the red sauce from his skin.The sight of his tongue moving over bare flesh, even his own flesh, sent an arrow of longing straight down between Lisss thighs.Okay, fair enough.Yes, she was more than happy to abandon this line of conversation.Hey, guys.Liss looked up, and Connor looked behind him, to see Jack standing there.Mind if I pull up a chair?Please, she said.Anything to break the weirdness of this moment.Why were things weird?Was it because she had moved in?Glad youre here, Jack, Connor said.As soon as I finish eating, Id love to kick your ass at darts.Youre welcome to try.Jack joining the group added an air of familiarity, of normalcy.A much needed injection of it, after the roiling jealousy shed experienced watching Connor get hit on, and the flash of heat that had assaulted her only moments later.She had to get a grip.Because, like Connor said, he was in no place to hook up.And even if he were, it wouldnt be with her.She wouldnt want it to be her, anyway.Some things in life are too important to screw up with sex.Her friendship with Connor was one of them.She had decided that years ago, and other than one brief lapse, a few months where she had thought things might be changing between them, she had always thought that.It was true then; it was true now.Connor was the best friend shed ever had, and she would do anything to protect that friendship.Anything.CONNOR WAS GETTING a late start to the day.Fortunately, his team was good, and he knew that the animals would be taken care of.Still, he hated oversleeping.But he, Jack and Liss had stayed way too late at Aces last night, flinging darts at the board, laughing about stupid stuff and in general ignoring the reality of life.Reality that had slapped him in the face pretty hard this morning when his alarm had gone off.It wasnt just the fact that they had stayed at the bar late.Once theyd made it home, Connor had had a hell of a time sleeping.It had been as if something was sitting on his chest, making it impossible to breathe, impossible to do anything but lie there, sweat beading on his brow, panic rising in his throat.Not for the first time, he wished he had accepted medication for his anxiety.But when the doctor had offered it a couple of years back, Connor had just laughed it off and said he didnt need a pill when a beer would do the job.But he was getting tired of the hangovers.He was tired of the anxiety, too.Hell, he was tired of all this shit.He would never have thought hed be the kind of guy to become a head case over a little grief.Or a lot of grief.It seemed as if he might be, though.I dont have enough energy to fill out my insurance paperwork.Why would you think I had the energy to screw somebody?A flash of last nights conversation popped into his mind.Had he really said that to Liss?Yeah, he had.He didnt suppose it was normal to still be this tired.To still be this overwhelmed by what was left.But then, there was nothing normal about losing your entire future.All of your plans.Everything you were.The finality was the worst part.It just happened.Unexpected, fast.Jessie had gone out to visit with her friends.A normal night, nothing unusual at all.And she hadnt come home.Just like that, every plan for the future gone.And he was sort of stubbornly sitting here in the present, afraid to plan for a future hed never wanted in the first place.One where he was alone, single.But here he was, and now...He couldnt readjust, not again.He let out a heavy breath and walked to his dresser, jerking open the bottom drawer and digging for some underwear.And there were none.Because he didnt keep up on his laundry, because he sucked.He sucked at taking care of himself, and he had sucked at taking care of his wife.Of course it was too late to fix a marriage that had been put asunder by death.But it wasnt too late to fix the situation with his underwear.He walked downstairswearing nothing but yesterdays underwearand headed toward the laundry room.Hopefully there was something in the dryer.He was not the best at keeping up on laundry.Because laundry was terrible.But sometimes he ended up with one or two baskets full of clean clothes, just sitting in there, because he hated to put things away.Liss had accused him of being a man child on more than one occasion.He was starting to think she might be right.It was a pretty sad sack thing, now that he thought about it.A grown man not being able to see to his own household.But Eli had always done that when they were growing up, after their mother had left.And then Connor had married Jessie, and she had handled all of it.It wasnt a great excuse.He had always expected for it to be taken care of, and it had been.While he had spent his days working himself blind on the ranch.Hed intended to change.Because Jessie had asked him to.And because she deserved for him to.Only then it had been too late.So hed gone right back to how hed always been.Because there was no one to be different for.No one to be better for.And because of that, he had no clean underwear.He opened up the laundry room door and saw two baskets filled with clothes on the floor.He opened up the dryer door, and there was a full load in there, too.Okay, he was bound to come up successful in this pursuit.He started to dig through the dryer and realized pretty quickly he wasnt looking at his own clothes.He grabbed a basket and stuck it underneath the opening to the dryer, pulling the clothes that were inside out and into said basket.His hand got caught around something lacy and flimsy, and he looked down and froze.Well, he had found clean underwear.They just werent his.For a full ten seconds he sat there and looked at the mint green panties that were in his hand.They were delicate, feminine.And very, very tiny.He had never imagined that Liss wore underwear like this beneath her rather sensible outfits.Well, in fairness, he had never thought about Lisss underwear before.But he was thinking about them now.He couldnt stop himself from running his thumb over the soft, flat waistband.He swallowed hard, lifting them up so that he could see the shape.It was a thong, which was very unexpected.Even more unexpected was the quick image that flashed through his mind of what Liss must look like wearing them.A shadow of copper curls beneath the flimsy lace, and the round, shapely ass that would be displayed to perfection.He dropped the panties back into the basket and stood up, taking a step back as if there was a rattlesnake in there amid the clothes.Since when did he imagine Liss in her underwear?More important, since when had he noticed that her ass was shapely?He never had, not consciously.It must be something his subconscious had absorbed.Some kind of male instinct he had thought long destroyed busily cataloging desirable feminine attributes even while his conscious mind was shutting it out.He reached into the basket next to the one containing Lisss clothes, stripped off his old underwear and quickly pulled on a new pair, before jerking the laundry room door open and walking out into the kitchen.Unfortunately, just as he walked in, so did Liss.Her eyes flew wide, and she took two steps backward, her cheeks turning bright pink.Sorry.She turned and walked out of the room as quickly as she had just walked in.Dammit, he growled, stalking back to the staircase and heading back to his room as quickly as possible.He put on a pair of tan Carhartt pants and a black T shirt, before going back downstairs to do some damage control.Although, really, there should be no damage to control.It wasnt as if she hadnt seen him in various states of undress over the years.It just felt more inappropriate, because he had just been handling her panties.Liss?In here, she said, her voice sounding muffled.He walked toward the living room and into the room, just in time to see Liss scrambling up from the couch, throwing one of the decorative pillows back onto the cushion.She looked at him, her lower lip sucked between her teeth.They just sort of stood there, frozen, staring at each other.Then a gust of air tried to escape Lisss mouth, turning into a sound that was somewhere between a growl and a snort.He frowned.Are you laughing at me?Her shoulders shook, her face turning redder.She shook her head, still biting her lower lip.Im serious, Liss.You just saw me in my underwear, and youre laughing?I have to figure out if Im insulted by this or not.She shook her head again, sitting down on the couch, her face getting redder, the shaking in her shoulders getting increasingly violent.Either youre having a stroke, or you are laughing at the sight of me in my undies.She released her lower lip and heaved in a deep breath, a guffaw escaping a second later.No!No.Youre not laughing.No, she hooted, Im not laughing.Yes, you are.Not at the sight of you in your underwear.I mean, not like you think, she said, breathless.It was just so absurd.You were looking at me.I was just looking at you.I happened to walk in and you were in the kitchen, and you were pretty much naked.She was rambling now, but it was a whole lot better than the alternative.Because things were kind of jumbled up in his head.And for some reason, he was still picturing her in her underwear, even though he was the one who had been caught in his.I thought you were at work.I forgot my cell phone, so I came back because I didnt have any important appointments this morning.I guess this is a part of negotiating the living situation.I guess.She cleared her throat.Really, though, its nothing Ive never seen before.He tried not to be offended by that comment.As though any man in his underwear was exactly the same as him.Really, he had no place to be offended by that comment.Because the sight of him mostly naked should not be remarkable to his best friend.And yet, his masculine egowhich along with his nice ass radar, was not as dormant as he had believedwas slightly dented.True.But then, Ive seen plenty of women in their underwear only one, now two, in person and others in pictures, but Liss didnt need to know that and that does not mean that youre going to be prancing around in here in a state of undress.He regretted saying that the moment he did, because it brought to mind those images he was working so hard to banish.Are you?No.Would you rather I act completely scandalized?Should I have had you fetch the smelling salts?I dont have smelling salts.All I have is barbecue steak rub.I dont think its the same.She rolled her eyes.Yeah, I dont think so.Okay, so heres the deal.I wont assume that youre not in the house anymore.And I wont come walking downstairs in my underwear.Deal.Okay, he said, taking a step away from her, rubbing the back of his neck.I suppose you need to get back to work.I know I do.Yeah, I should.He nodded, a thread of tension stretching between them, and he wanted to banish it.Wanted to do something to get rid of it, because this wasnt normal.Great, Ill see you for dinner.I might go out with Jeanette, she said quickly.Okay.Ill see you later, then.Yeah, later.Connor turned and walked out of the room.It was probably a good thing Liss was going out tonight.After only a couple of days of cohabitation, he felt as though they could maybe use a little space.But this was normal, this adjustment period.Connor hadnt lived with anyone in a few years, and hed lived with Jessie for a long time.Even then, they had a lot of miscommunications and a lot of ups and downs.There was no reason to believe it would be any different with a roommate.He opened the door and took a deep breath, banishing all the weirdness that lingered inside him.There was no time to worry about any of that.
