He glides his tongue up my instep  and I can no longer watch him.Its too erotic.Im going to combust.I squeeze my eyes shut and try to absorb and manage all the sensations hes creating.He kisses my ankle and trails kisses up my calf to my knee, stopping just above.He then starts on my right foot, repeating the whole, seductive, mind blowing process.Oh, please, I moan as he bites my little toe, the action resonating deep in my belly.All good things, Miss Steele, he breathes.This time he doesnt stop at my knee, he continues up the inside of my thigh, pushing my thighs apart as he does.And I know what hes going to do, and part of me wants to push him off because Im mortified and embarrassed.Hes going to kiss me there!I know it.And part of me is glorying in the anticipation.He turns to my other knee and kisses his way up my thigh, kissing, licking, sucking, and then hes between my legs, running his nose up and down my sex, very softly, very gently.I writhe oh my.He stops, waiting for me to calm.I do and raise my head to gaze at him, my mouth open as my pounding heart struggles to come out.Do you know how intoxicating you smell, Miss Steele?he murmurs, and keeping his eyes on mine, he pushes his nose into my pubic hair and inhales.I flush scarlet, everywhere, feeling faint, and I instantly close my eyes.I cant watch him do that!He blows gently up the length of my sex.Oh fuck  I like this.He gently tugs at my pubic hair.Perhaps well keep this.Oh please, I beg.Hmm, I like it when you beg me, Anastasia.I groan.Tit for tat is not my usual style, Miss Steele, he whispers as he gently blows up and down me.But youve pleased me today, and you should be rewarded.I hear the wicked grin in his voice, and while my body is singing from his words, his tongue starts to slowly circle my clitoris as his hands hold down my thighs.Aargh!I moan as my body bows and convulses at the touch of his tongue.He swirls his tongue round and round, again and again, keeping up the torture.Im losing all sense of self, every atom of my being concentrating hard on that small, potent powerhouse at the apex of my thighs.My legs go rigid, and he slips his finger inside me, and I hear his growling groan.Oh, baby.I love that youre so wet for me.He moves his finger in a wide circle, stretching me, pulling at me, his tongue mirroring his actions, round and round, I groan.It is too much My body begs for relief, and I can no longer deny it.I let go, losing all cogent thought as my orgasm seizes me, wringing my insides again and again.Holy fuck.I cry out, and the world dips and disappears from view as the force of my climax renders everything null and void.I am panting and vaguely hear the rip of foil.Very slowly he eases into me and starts to move.Oh my.The feeling is sore and sweet, and bold and gentle all at once.Hows this?he breathes.Fine.Good, I breathe.And he really starts to move, fast, hard, and large, thrusting into me over and over, implacable, pushing me and pushing me until I am close to the edge again.I whimper.Come for me, baby.His voice is harsh, hard, raw at my ear, and I explode around him as he pounds rapidly into me.Thank fuck, he whispers, and he thrusts hard once more and groans as he reaches his climax, pressing himself into me.Then he stills, his body rigid.Collapsing on top of me, I feel his full weight forcing me into the mattress.I pull my tied hands over his neck and hold him the best I can.I know in that moment that I would do anything for this man.I am his.The wonder that hes introduced me to, its beyond anything I could have imagined.And he wants to take it further, so much further, to a place I cant, in my innocence, even imagine.Oh what to do?He leans up on his elbows and stares down at me, gray eyes intense.See how good we are together, he murmurs.If you give yourself to me, it will be so much better.Trust me, Anastasia, I can take you places you dont even know exist.His words echo my thoughts.He strokes his nose against mine.I am still reeling from my extraordinary physical reaction to him, and I gaze up at him blankly, grasping for a coherent thought.Suddenly we both become aware of voices in the hall outside his bedroom door.It takes a moment to process what I can hear.But if hes still in bed, then he must be ill.Hes never in bed at this time.Christian never sleeps in.Mrs.Grey, please.Taylor.You cannot keep me from my son.Mrs.Grey, hes not alone.What do you mean hes not alone?He has someone with him.Oh  Even I hear the disbelief in her voice.Christian blinks rapidly, staring down at me, wide eyed with humored horror.Shit!Its my mother.He pulls out of me suddenly.I wince.He sits up on the bed and throws the used condom in a wastebasket.Come on, we need to get dressed  thats if you want to meet my mother.He grins, leaps up off the bed, and pulls on his jeans, no underwear!I struggle to sit up as Im still tethered.Christian   I cant move.His grin widens, and leaning down, he undoes the tie.The woven pattern has made an indented pattern around my wrists.Its sexy.He gazes at me.Hes amused, his eyes dancing with mirth.He kisses my forehead quickly and beams at me.Another first, he acknowledges, but I have no idea what hes talking about.I have no clean clothes in here.I am filled with sudden panic, and considering what Ive just experienced, Im finding the panic overwhelming.His mother!Holy crap.I have no clean clothes, and shes practically walked in on us in flagrante delicto.Perhaps I should stay here.Oh, no, you dont, Christian threatens.You can wear something of mine.Hes slipped on a white t shirt and runs his hand through his just fucked hair.In spite of my anxiety, I lose my train of thought.Will I ever get used to looking at this beautiful man?His beauty is derailing.Anastasia, you could be wearing a sack and youd look lovely.Please dont worry.Id like you to meet my mother.Get dressed.Ill just go and calm her down.His mouth presses into a hard line.I will expect you in that room in five minutes, otherwise Ill come and drag you out of here myself in whatever youre wearing.My t shirts are in this drawer.My shirts are in the closet.Help yourself.He eyes me speculatively for a moment, then leaves the room.Holy shit.Christians mother.This is so much more than I bargained for.Perhaps meeting her will help put a little part of the jigsaw in place.Might help me understand why Christian is the way he is Suddenly, I want to meet her.I pull my shirt off the floor, and Im pleased to discover that it has survived the night well with hardly any creases.I find my blue bra under the bed and dress quickly.But if theres one thing I hate, its not wearing clean panties.I rifle through Christians chest of drawers and come across his boxer briefs.After pulling on a pair of tight gray Calvin Kleins, I tug on my jeans and my Converse.Grabbing my jacket, I dash into the bathroom and stare at my too bright eyes, my flushed face  and my hair!Holy crap just fucked pigtails do not suit me either.I hunt in the vanity unit for a brush and find a comb.It will have to do.A ponytail is the only answer.I despair at my clothes.Maybe I should take Christian up on his offer of clothes.My subconscious purses her lips and mouths the word ho.I ignore her.Struggling into my jacket, pleased that the cuffs cover the tell tale patterns from his tie, I take a last anxious glance at myself in the mirror.This will have to do.I make my way into the main living room.Here she is.Christian stands from where hes lounging on the couch.His expression is warm and appreciative.The sandy haired woman beside him turns and beams at me, a full megawatt smile.She stands too.Shes impeccably attired in a camel colored fine knit sweater dress with matching shoes.She looks groomed, elegant, beautiful, and inside I die a little, knowing I look such a mess.Mother, this is Anastasia Steele.Anastasia, this is Grace Trevelyan Grey.Dr.Trevelyan Grey holds her hand out to me.T for Trevelyan?What a pleasure to meet you, she murmurs.If Im not mistaken, there is wonder and maybe stunned relief in her voice and a warm glow in her hazel eyes.I grasp her hand, and I cant help but smile, returning her warmth.Dr.Trevelyan Grey, I murmur.Call me Grace, she grins, and Christian frowns.I am usually Dr.Trevelyan, and Mrs.Grey is my mother in law.She winks.So how did you two meet?She looks questioningly at Christian, unable to hide her curiosity.Anastasia interviewed me for the student paper at WSU because Im conferring the degrees there this week.Double crap.Id forgotten that.So you are graduating this week?Grace asks.Yes.My cell phone starts ringing.Kate, I bet.Excuse me.Its in the kitchen.I wander over and lean across the breakfast bar, not checking the number.Kate.Dios mio!Ana!Holy crap, its Jos.He sounds desperate.Where are you?Ive been trying to contact you.I need to see you, to apologize for my behavior on Friday.Why havent you returned my calls?Look Jos, nows not a good time.I glance anxiously over at Christian whos watching me intently, his face impassive as he murmurs something to his mom.I turn my back to him.Where are you?Kate is being so evasive, he whines.Im in Seattle.What are you doing in Seattle?Are you with him?Jos, Ill call you later.I cant talk to you now.I hang up.I walk as nonchalantly back to Christian and his mother.Grace is in full flow.And Elliot called to say you were around  I havent seen you for two weeks, darling.Did he now?Christian murmurs, gazing at me, his expression unreadable.I thought we might have lunch together, but I can see you have other plans, and I dont want to interrupt your day.She gathers up her long cream coat and turns to him, offering him her cheek.He kisses her briefly, sweetly.She doesnt touch him.I have to drive Anastasia back to Portland.Of course, darling.Anastasia, its been such a pleasure.I do hope we meet again.She holds her hand out to me, her eyes glowing, and we shake.Taylor appears from where?Mrs.Grey?he asks.Thank you, Taylor.He escorts her from the room and through the double doors to the foyer.Taylor was here the whole time?How long has he been here?Where has he been?Christian glares at me.So the photographer called?Crap.Yes.What did he want?Just to apologize, you know  for Friday.Christian narrows his eyes.I see, he says simply.Taylor reappears.Mr.Grey, theres an issue with the Darfur shipment.Christian nods curtly at him.Charlie Tango back at Boeing Field?Yes sir.Taylor nods at me.Miss Steele.I smile tentatively back at him, and he turns and leaves.Does he live here?Taylor?Yes.His tone is clipped.What is his problem?Christian heads over to the kitchen and picks up his BlackBerry, scrolling through some emails, I assume.His mouth presses in a hard line, and he makes a call.Ros, whats the issue?he snaps.He listens, watching me, gray eyes speculative, as I stand in the middle of the huge room wondering what to do with myself, feeling extraordinarily self conscious and out of place.Im not having either crew put at risk.No, cancel Well air drop instead Good.He hangs up.The warmth in his eyes has disappeared.He looks forbidding, and with one quick glance at me, he heads into his study and returns a moment later.This is the contract.Read it, and well discuss it next weekend.May I suggest you do some research, so you know whats involved.He pauses.Thats if you agree, and I really hope you do.He adds, his tone softer, anxious.Research?Youll be amazed what you can find on the Internet, he murmurs.Internet!I dont have access to a computer, only Kates laptop, and I couldnt use Claytons, not for this sort of research surely?What is it?he asks, cocking his head to one side.I dont have a computer.Ill see if I can use Kates laptop.He hands me a manila envelope.Im sure I can err, lend you one.Grab your things, well drive back to Portland and grab some lunch on the way.I need to dress.Ill just make a call, I murmur.I just want to hear Kates voice.He frowns.The photographer?His jaw clenches, and his eyes burn.I blink at him.I dont like to share, Miss Steele.Remember that.His quiet, chilling tone is a warning, and with one long, cold look at me, he heads back to the bedroom.Holy crap.I just wanted to call Kate, I want to call after him, but his sudden aloofness has left me paralyzed.What happened to the generous, relaxed, smiling man who was making love to me not half an hour ago?Ready?Christian asks as we stand by the double doors to the foyer.I nod uncertainly.Hes resumed his distant, polite, uptight persona, his mask back up and on show.Hes carrying a leather messenger bag.Why does he need that?Perhaps hes staying in Portland, and then I remember graduation.Oh yes hell be there on Thursday.Hes wearing a black leather jacket.He certainly doesnt look like the multi multi million aire, billionaire, what ever aire, in these clothes.He looks like a boy from the wrong side of the tracks, maybe a badly behaved rock star or a catwalk model.I sigh inwardly, wishing I had a tenth of his poise.Hes so calm and controlled.I frown, recalling his outburst about Jos Well, he seems to be.Taylor is hovering in the background.Tomorrow then, he says to Taylor who nods.Yes sir.Which car are you taking, sir?He looks down at me briefly.The R8.Safe trip, Mr.Grey.Miss Steele.Taylor looks kindly at me, though perhaps theres a hint of pity hidden in the depths of his eyes.No doubt he thinks Ive succumbed to Mr.Greys dubious sexual habits.Not yet, just his exceptional sexual habits, or perhaps sex is like that for everyone.I frown at the thought.I have no comparison, and I cant ask Kate.Thats something I am going to have to address with Christian.Its perfectly natural that I should talk to someone  and I cant talk to him if he is so open one minute and so standoffish the next.Taylor holds the door open for us and ushers us through.Christian summons the elevator.What is it, Anastasia?he asks.How does he know Im chewing something over in my mind?He reaches up and pulls my chin.Stop biting your lip, or I will fuck you in the elevator, and I dont care who gets in with us.I blush, but theres a hint of a smile around his lips, finally his mood seems to be shifting.Christian, I have a problem.Oh?I have his full attention.The elevator arrives.We walk in, and Christian presses the button marked G.   Well, I flush.How to say this?I need to talk to Kate.Ive so many questions about sex, and youre too involved.If you want me to do all these things, how do I know?I pause, struggling to find the right words.I just dont have any terms of reference.He rolls his eyes at me.Talk to her if you must.He sounds exasperated.Make sure she doesnt mention anything to Elliot.I bristle at his insinuation.Kate isnt like that.She wouldnt do that, and I wouldnt tell you anything she tells me about Elliot  if she were to tell me anything, I add quickly.Well, the difference is that I dont want to know about his sex life, Christian murmurs dryly.Elliots a nosy bastard.But only about what weve done so far, he warns.Shed probably have my balls if she knew what I wanted to do to you, he adds so softly Im not sure Im supposed to hear it.Okay, I agree readily, smiling up at him, relieved.The thought of Kate with Christians balls is not something I want to dwell on.His lip quirks up at me, and he shakes his head.The sooner I have your submission the better, and we can stop all this, he murmurs.Stop all what?You, defying me.He reaches down and cups my chin and plants a swift, sweet kiss on my lips as the doors to the elevator open.He grabs my hand and leads me into the underground garage.Me, defying him how?Beside the elevator, I can see the black 4x4 Audi, but its the sleek, black sporty number that blips open and lights up when he points the key fob at it.Its one of those cars that should have a very leggy blonde, wearing nothing but a sash, sprawled across the hood.Nice car, I murmur dryly.He glances up and grins.I know, he says, and for a split second, sweet, young, carefree Christian is back.It warms my heart.Hes so excited.Boys and their toys.I roll my eyes at him but cant stifle my smile.He opens the door for me and I climb in.Whoa its low.He moves round the car with easy grace and folds his long frame elegantly in beside me .How does he do that?So what sort of car is this?Its an Audi R8 Spyder.Its a lovely day, we can take the top down.Theres a baseball cap in there.In fact there should be two.He points to the glove box.And sunglasses if you want them.He starts the ignition, and the engine roars behind us.He places his bag in the space behind our seats, presses a button, and the roof slowly reclines.With the flick of a switch, Bruce Springsteen surrounds us.Gotta love Bruce, he grins at me and eases the car out of the parking space, and up the steep ramp where we pause for the barrier.Then were out into the bright Seattle May morning.I reach into the glove box and retrieve the baseball caps.The Mariners.He likes baseball?I pass him a cap, and he puts it on.I pass my ponytail through the back of mine and pull the peak down low.People stare at us as we drive through the streets.For a moment, I think its at him  and then a very paranoid part thinks everyone is looking at me because they know what Ive been doing during the last twelve hours, but finally, I realize its the car.Christian seems oblivious, lost in thought.The traffic is light and were soon on the I 5 heading south, the wind sweeping over our heads.Bruce is singing about being on fire and his desire.How apt.I flush as I listen to the words.Christian glances at me.Hes got his Ray Bans on so I cant see what hes thinking.His mouth twitches slightly, and he reaches across and places his hand on my knee, squeezing gently.My breath hitches.Hungry?he asks.Not for food.Not particularly.His mouth tightens into that hard line.You must eat, Anastasia, he chides.I know a great place near Olympia.Well stop there.He squeezes my knee again, and then returns his hand to the steering wheel as he puts his foot down on the gas.Im pressed into the back of my seat.Boy this car can move.The restaurant is small and intimate, a wooden chalet in the middle of a forest.The dcor is rustic: random chairs and tables with gingham tablecloths, wild flowers in little vases.Cuisine Sauvage, it boasts above the door.Ive not been here for a while.We dont get a choice  they cook whatever theyve caught or gathered.He raises his eyebrows in mock horror, and I have to laugh.The waitress takes our drinks order.She flushes when she sees Christian, avoiding eye contact with him, hiding under her long blonde bangs.She likes him!Its not just me!Two glasses of the Pinot Grigio, Christian says with a voice of authority.I purse my lips, exasperated.What?he snaps.I wanted a Diet Coke, I whisper.His gray eyes narrow, and he shakes his head.The Pinot Grigio heres a decent wine, it will go well with the meal, whatever we get.He says patiently.Whatever we get?Yes.He smiles, his dazzling, head cocked to one side smile, and my stomach pole vaults over my spleen.I cant help but reflect his glorious smile back at him.My mother liked you, he says dryly.Really?His words make me flush with pleasure.Oh yes.Shes always thought I was gay.My mouth drops open, and I remember that question from the interview.Oh no.Why did she think you were gay?I whisper.Because shes never seen me with a girl.Oh not even one of the fifteen?He smiles.You remembered.No, none of the fifteen.Oh.You know, Anastasia, its been a weekend of firsts for me, too, he says quietly.It has?Ive never slept with anyone, never had sex in my bed, never flown a girl in Charlie Tango, never introduced a woman to my mother.What are you doing to me?His eyes burn, their intensity takes my breath away.The waitress arrives with our glasses of wine, and I immediately take a quick sip.Is he opening up or just making a casual observation?Ive really enjoyed this weekend, I murmur.He narrows his eyes at me again.Stop biting that lip, he growls.Me too, he adds.Whats vanilla sex?I ask, if anything to distract myself from the intense, burning, sexy look hes giving me.He laughs.Just straightforward sex, Anastasia.No toys, no added extras.He shrugs.You know well actually you dont, but thats what it means.Oh.I thought it was chocolate fudge brownie sex that we had, with a cherry on the top.But hey, what do I know?The waitress brings us soup.We both stare at it rather dubiously.Nettle soup, the waitress informs us before turning and flouncing back into the kitchen.I dont think she likes to be ignored by Christian.I take a tentative taste.Its delicious.Christian and I look up at each other at the same time with relief.I giggle, and he cocks his head to one side.Thats a lovely sound, he murmurs.Why have you never had vanilla sex before?Have you always done err, what youve done?I ask, intrigued.He nods slowly.Sort of.His voice is wary.He frowns for a moment and seems to be engaged in some kind of internal struggle.Then he glances up, a decision made.One of my mothers friends seduced me when I was fifteen.Oh.Holy shit thats young!She had very particular tastes.I was her submissive for six years.He shrugs.Oh.My brain has frozen, stunned into inactivity by this admission.So I do know what it involves, Anastasia.His eyes glow with insight.I stare at him, unable to articulate anything  even my subconscious is silent.I didnt really have a run of the mill introduction to sex.Curiosity kicks in big time.So you never dated anyone at college?No.He shakes his head to emphasize the point.The waitress takes our plates, interrupting us for a moment.Why?I ask when shes gone.He smiles sardonically.Do you really want to know?Yes.I didnt want to.She was all I wanted, needed.And besides, shed have beaten the shit out of me.He smiles fondly at the memory.Oh, this is way too much information  but I want more.So if she was a friend of your mothers, how old was she?He smirks.Old enough to know better.Do you still see her?Yes.Do you still err ?I flush.No.He shakes his head and smiles indulgently at me.Shes a very good friend.Oh.Does your mother know?He gives me a dont be stupid stare.Of course not.The waitress returns with venison, but my appetite has vanished.What a revelation.Christian the submissive Holy shit.I take a large slug of Pinot Grigio  hes right, of course, its delicious.Jeez, all these revelations, its so much to think about.I need time to process this, when Im on my own, not when Im distracted by his presence.Hes so overwhelming, so Alpha Male, and now hes thrown this bombshell into the equation.He knows what its like.But it cant have been full time?Im confused.Well, it was, though I didnt see her all the time.It was difficult.After all, I was still at school and then at college.Eat up, Anastasia.Im really not hungry, Christian.I am reeling from your disclosure.His expression hardens.Eat, he says quietly, too quietly.I stare at him.This man  sexually abused as an adolescent  his tone is so threatening.Give me a moment, I mutter quietly.He blinks a couple of times.Okay, he murmurs, and he continues with his meal.This is what it will be like if I sign, him ordering me around.I frown.Do I want this?Reaching for my knife and fork, I tentatively cut into the venison.Its very tasty.Is this what our err relationship will be like?I whisper.You, ordering me around?I cant quite bring myself to look at him.Yes, he murmurs.I see.And whats more, youll want me to, he adds, his voice low.I sincerely doubt that.I slice another piece of venison, holding it against my mouth.Its a big step, I murmur and eat.It is.He closes his eyes briefly.When he opens them, they are wide and grave.Anastasia, you have to go with your gut.Do the research, read the contract  Im happy to discuss any aspect.Ill be in Portland until Friday if you want to talk about it before then.His words are coming at me in a rush.Call me  maybe we can have dinner  say, Wednesday?I really want to make this work.In fact, Ive never wanted anything as much as I want this to work.His burning sincerity, his longing, is reflected in his eyes.This is fundamentally what I dont grasp.Why me?Why not one of the fifteen?Oh no Will that be me  a number?Sixteen of many?What happened to the fifteen?I blurt.He raises his eyebrows in surprise, then looks resigned, shaking his head.Various things, but it boils down to, he pauses, struggling to find the words I think.Incompatibility.He shrugs.And you think that I might be compatible with you?Yes.So youre not seeing any of them anymore?No, Anastasia, Im not.I am monogamous in my relationships.Oh this is news.I see.Do the research, Anastasia.I put my knife and fork down.I cannot eat any more.Thats it?Thats all youre going to eat?I nod.He scowls at me but chooses not to say anything.I breathe a small sigh of relief.My stomach is churning with all this new information, and Im feeling a little lightheaded from the wine.I watch as he devours everything on his plate.He eats like a horse.He must work out to stay in such great shape.The memory of the way his PJs hung from his hips comes unbidden to my mind.The image is totally distracting.I squirm uncomfortably.He glances up at me, and I blush.Id give anything to know what youre thinking right at this moment, he murmurs.I blush further.He smiles a wicked smile at me.I can guess, he teases softly.Im glad you cant read my mind.Your mind, no, Anastasia, but your body  that Ive got to know quite well since yesterday.His voice is suggestive.How does he switch so quickly from one mood to the next?Hes so mercurial Its hard to keep up.He motions for the waitress and asks for the check.Once hes paid, he stands and holds out his hand.Come.Taking my hand in his, he leads me back to the car.This contact, flesh to flesh, its what is so unexpected from him, normal, intimate.I cant reconcile this ordinary, tender gesture with what he wants to do in that room The Red Room of Pain.We are quiet on the drive from Olympia to Vancouver, both lost in our own thoughts.When he parks outside my apartment, its five in the evening.The lights are on  Kate is at home.Packing, no doubt, unless Elliot is still there.He switches off the engine, and I realize Im going to have to leave him.Do you want to come in?I ask.I dont want him to go.I want to prolong our time together.No.I have work to do, he says simply, gazing at me, his expression unfathomable.I stare down at my hands, as I knot my fingers together.Suddenly I feel emotional.Hes leaving.Reaching over, he takes one of my hands and slowly pulls it to his mouth, tenderly kissing the back of my hand, such an old fashioned, sweet gesture.My heart leaps into my mouth.Thank you for this weekend, Anastasia.Its been the best.Wednesday?Ill pick you up from work, from wherever?he says softly.Wednesday, I whisper.He kisses my hand again and places it back in my lap.He climbs out, comes round to my side, and opens the passenger door.Why do I feel suddenly bereft?A lump forms in my throat.I must not let him see me like this.Fixing a smile on my face, I clamber out of the car and head up the path, knowing I have to face Kate, dreading facing Kate.I turn and gaze at him midway.Chin up Steele, I chide myself.Oh by the way, Im wearing your underwear.I give him a small smile and pull up the waistband of the boxer briefs Im wearing so he can see.Christians mouth drops open, shocked.What a great reaction.My mood shifts immediately, and I sashay into the house, part of me wanting to jump and punch the air.YES!My inner goddess is thrilled.Kate is in the living area packing up her books into crates.Youre back.Wheres Christian?How are you?Her voice is fevered, anxious, and she bounds up to me, grabbing my shoulders, minutely analyzing my face before Ive even said hello.Crap I have to deal with Kates persistence and tenacity, and Im in possession of a legal signed document saying I cant talk.Its not a healthy mix.Well how was it?I couldnt stop thinking about you, after Elliot left, that is.She grins mischievously.I cant help but smile at her concern and her burning curiosity, but suddenly I feel shy.I blush.It was very private.All of it.Seeing and knowing what Christian has to hide.But I have to give her some details, because she wont leave me alone until I do.It was good, Kate.Very good, I think, I say quietly, trying to hide my embarrassed tell all smile.You think?Ive got nothing to compare it to, do I?I shrug apologetically.Did he make you come?Holy crap.Shes so blunt.I go scarlet.Yes, I mumble, exasperated.Kate pulls me to the couch and we sit.She clasps my hands.That is good.Kate looks at me in disbelief.It was your first time.Wow, Christian must really know what hes doing.Oh Kate, if only you knew.My first time was horrid, she continues, making a sad comedy face.Oh?This has me interested, something shes never divulged before.Yes, Steve Paton.High school, dickless jock.She shudders.He was rough.I wasnt ready.We were both drunk.You know  typical teenage post prom disaster.Ugh   it took me months before I decided to have another go.And not with him, the gutless wonder.I was too young.You were right to wait.Kate, that sounds awful.Kate looks wistful.Yeah, took almost a year to have my first orgasm through penetrative sex and here you are first time?I nod shyly.My inner goddess sits in the lotus position looking serene except for the sly, self congratulatory smile on her face.Im glad you lost it to someone who knows their ass from their elbow.She winks at me.So when are you seeing him again?Wednesday.Were having dinner.So you still like him?Yes.But I dont know about the future.Why?Hes complicated, Kate.You know  he inhabits a very different world to mine.Great excuse.Believable too.Much better than  hes got a Red Room of Pain, and he wants to make me his sex slave.Oh please, dont let this be about money, Ana.Elliot said its very unusual for Christian to date anyone.Did he?My voice hitches up several octaves.Too obvious, Steele!My subconscious glares at me, wagging her long skinny finger, then morphs into the scales of justice to remind me he could sue if I disclose too much.Ha whats he going to do  take all my money?I must remember to Google penalties for breaching a non disclosure agreement while Im doing the rest of my research.Its like Ive been given a school assignment.Maybe Ill be graded.I flush, remembering my A for this mornings bath experiment.Ana, what is it?Im just remembering something Christian said.You look different, Kate says fondly.I feel different.Sore, I confess.Sore?A little.I flush.Me too.Men, she says in mock disgust.Theyre animals.We both laugh.Youre sore?I exclaim.Yes overuse.I giggle.Tell me about Elliot the over user, I ask when Ive stopped giggling.Oh, I can feel myself relaxing for the first time since I was in line at the bar before the phone call that started all this  when I was admiring Mr.Grey from afar.Happy uncomplicated days.Kate blushes.Oh my Katherine Agnes Kavanagh goes all Anastasia Rose Steele on me.She gives me a dewy eyed look.Ive never seen her react this way to a man before.My jaw drops to the floor.Wheres Kate, what have you done with her?Oh, Ana, she gushes.Hes just so Everything.And when we oh really good.She can hardly string a sentence together shes got it so bad.I think youre trying to tell me that you like him.She nods, grinning like a lunatic.And Im seeing him on Saturday.Hes going to help us move.She clasps her hands together, leaps up off the couch, and pirouettes to the window.Moving.Crap  Id forgotten all about that, even with the packing cases surrounding us.Thats helpful of him, I say appreciatively.I can get to know him too.Perhaps he can give me more insight into his strange, disturbing brother.So what did you do last night?I ask.She cocks her head at me and raises her eyebrows in a what do think stupid look.Pretty much what you did, though we had dinner first.She grins at me.Are you okay really?You look kind of overwhelmed.I feel overwhelmed.Christian is very intense.Yeah, I could see how he could be.But he was good to you?Yes, I reassure her.Im really hungry, shall I cook?She nods and picks up two more books to pack.What do you want to do with the fourteen thousand dollar books?she asks.Im going to return them to him.Really?Its a completely over the top gift.I cant accept it, especially now.I grin at Kate, and she nods.I understand.A couple of letters came for you, and Jos has been calling every hour on the hour.He sounded desperate.Ill call him, I mutter evasively.If I tell Kate about Jos, shell have him for breakfast.I collect the letters from the dining table and open them.Hey, I have interviews!The week after next, in Seattle, for intern placements!For which publishing house?For both of them!I told you your GPA would open doors, Ana.Kate, of course, already has an internship set up at the Seattle Times.Her father knows someone, who knows someone.How does Elliot feel about you going away?I ask.Kate wanders into the kitchen, and for the first time this evening, shes disconsolate.Hes understanding.Part of me doesnt want to go, but its tempting to lie in the sun for a couple of weeks.Besides, Mom is hanging in there, thinking this will be our last real family holiday before Ethan and I head off into the world of paid employment.I have never left continental US.Kate is off to Barbados with her parents and her brother Ethan for two whole weeks.Ill be Kateless in our new apartment.That will be weird.Ethan has been traveling the world since he graduated last year.I wonder briefly if Ill see him before they go on vacation.Hes such a lovely guy.The phone rings, jolting me from my reverie.Thatll be Jos.I sigh.I know I have to talk to him.I grab the phone.Hi.Ana, youre back!Jos shouts his relief at me.Obviously.Sarcasm drips from my voice, and I roll my eyes at the phone.Hes silent for a moment.Can I see you?Im sorry about Friday night.I was drunk and you well.Ana   please forgive me.Of course, I forgive you Jos.Just dont do it again.You know I dont feel like that about you.He sighs heavily, sadly.I know, Ana.I just thought, if I kissed you, it might change how you feel.Jos, I love you dearly, you mean so much to me.Youre like the brother I never had.Thats not going to change.You know that.I hate to let him down, but its the truth.So youre with him now?His tone is full of disdain.Jos, Im not with anybody.But you spent the night with him.Thats none of your business!Is it the money?Jos!How dare you!I shout, staggered by his audacity.Ana, he whines and apologizes simultaneously.I cannot deal with his petty jealousy now.I know hes hurt, but my plate is overflowing dealing with Christian Grey.Maybe we can have a coffee or something tomorrow.Ill call you.I am conciliatory.He is my friend, and Im very fond of him.But right now, I dont need this.Tomorrow then.Youll call?The hope in his voice twists my heart.Yes goodnight, Jos.I hang up, not waiting for his response.What was that all about?Katherine demands, her hands on her hips.I decide honesty is the policy.Shes looking more intractable than ever.He made a pass at me on Friday.Jos?And Christian Grey?Ana, your pheromones must be working overtime.What was the stupid fool thinking?She shakes her head in disgust and returns to packing crates.Forty five minutes later, we pause our packing for the house specialty, my lasagna.Kate opens a bottle of wine, and we sit amongst the boxes eating, quaffing cheap red wine, and watching crap TV.This is normality.Its so grounding and welcome after the last forty eight hours of madness.I eat my first unhurried, no nagging, peaceful meal in that time.What is it about him and food?Kate clears the dishes, and I finish packing up the living room.We are left with the couch, the TV, and the dining table.What more could we need?Just the kitchen and our bedrooms left to pack up, and we have the rest of the week.Result!The phone rings again.Its Elliot.Kate winks at me and skips off to her bedroom like shes fourteen.I know that she should be writing her Valedictorian speech, but it seems Elliot is more important.What is it about the Grey men?What is it that makes them totally distracting, all consuming, and irresistible?I take another slug of wine.I flick through the TV channels, but deep down I know Im procrastinating.Burning a bright red hole in the side of my purse is that contract.Do I have the strength and the wherewithal to read it tonight?I put my head in my hands.Jos and Christian, they both want something from me.Jos is easy to deal with.But Christian Christian takes a whole different league of handling, of understanding.Part of me wants to run and hide.What am I going to do?His burning gray eyes and that intense smoldering stare come into my minds eye, and my body tightens at the thought.I gasp.Hes not even here, and Im turned on.It just cant be about sex, can it?I recall his gentle banter this morning at breakfast, his joy at my delight with the helicopter ride, him playing the piano  the sweet soulful oh so sad music.Hes such a complicated person.And now I have an insight as to why.A young man deprived of his adolescence, sexually abused by some evil Mrs.Robinson figure no wonder hes old before his time.My heart fills with sadness at the thought of what he must have been through.Im too nave to know exactly what, but the research should shed some light.But do I really want to know?Do I want to explore this world I know nothing about?Its such a big step.If Id not met him, Id still be sweetly and blissfully oblivious.My mind drifts to last night, and this morning and the incredible, sensual sexuality Ive experienced.Do I want to say goodbye to that?No!Screams my subconscious my inner goddess nods in silent zen like agreement with her.Kate wanders back into the living room, grinning from ear to ear.Perhaps shes in love  I gape at her.Shes never behaved like this.Ana, Im off to bed.Im pretty tired.Me too, Kate.She hugs me.Im glad youre back in one piece.Theres something about Christian, she adds quietly, apologetically.I give her a small, reassuring smile  all the while thinking How the hell does she know?This is what will make her a great journalist, her unfaltering intuition.Collecting my purse, I wander listlessly into my bedroom.I am weary from all our carnal exertions of the last day and from the complete and utter dilemma that Im faced with.I sit on my bed and gingerly extract the manila envelope from the bag, turning it over and over in my hands.Do I really want to know the extent of Christians depravity?Its so daunting.I take a deep breath, and with my heart in my throat, I rip open the envelope.There are several papers inside the envelope.I fish them out, my heart still pounding, and I sit back on my bed and begin to read.CONTRACT   Made this day_________ of 2011 (The

head is buzzing.How can I possibly agree to all this?And apparently its for my benefit, to explore my sensuality, my limits  safely  oh please!I scoff angrily.Serve and obey in all things.All Things!I shake my head in disbelief.Actually, doesnt the marriage ceremony use those words obey?This throws me.Do couples still say that?Only three months, is that why there have been so many?He doesnt keep them for long?Or have they had enough after three months?Every weekend?Thats too much.Ill never see Kate or whatever friends I may make at my new job  provided I get one.Perhaps I should have one weekend a month to myself.Perhaps when I have my period, that sounds practical.Hes my master!To be dealt with as he pleases!Holy shit.I shudder at the thought of being flogged or whipped.Spanking probably wouldnt be so bad, humiliating though.And tied up?Well he did tie my hands together.That was  well it was hot, really hot, so perhaps that wont be so bad.He wont loan me to another Dominant  damn right he wont.That would be totally unacceptable.Why am I even thinking about this?I cant look him in the eye.How weird is that?The only way I ever have any chance to see what hes thinking.Actually, whom am I kidding, I never know what hes thinking, but I like looking into his eyes.He has beautiful eyes  captivating, intelligent, deep and dark, dark with dominant secrets.I recall his burning smoky gaze and press my thighs together, squirming.And I cant touch him.Well, no surprise there.And these silly rules No, no I cant do this.I put my head in my hands.This is no way to have a relationship.I need some sleep.Im shattered.All the physical shenanigans Ive been engaged in over the last twenty four hours have been, frankly, exhausting.And mentally oh man, this is so much to take on board.As Jos would say, a real mind fuck.Perhaps in the morning, this might not read like a bad joke.I scramble up and change quickly.Perhaps I should borrow Kates pink flannel pajamas.I want something cuddly and reassuring around me.I head to the bathroom in my t shirt and sleep shorts and brush my teeth.I stare at myself in the bathroom mirror.You cant seriously be considering this  My subconscious sounds sane and rational, not her usual snarky self.My inner goddess is jumping up and down, clapping her hands like a five year old.Please, lets do this  otherwise well end up alone with lots of cats and your classic novels to keep you company.The only man Ive ever been attracted to, and he comes with a bloody contract, a flogger, and a whole world of issues.Well, at least I got my way this weekend.My inner goddess stops jumping and smiles serenely.Oh yes she mouths, nodding at me smugly.I flush at the memory of his hands and his mouth on me, his body inside mine.Closing my eyes, I feel the familiar delicious pull of my muscles from deep, deep down.I want to do that again and again.Maybe if I just sign up for the sex would he go with that?I suspect not.Am I submissive?Maybe I come across that way.Maybe I misled him in the interview.Im shy, yes but submissive?I let Kate bully me  is that the same?And those soft limits, jeez.My mind boggles, but Im reassured that they are up for discussion.I wander back to my bedroom.This is too much to think about.I need a clear head  a fresh morning approach to the problem.I put the offending documents back in my satchel.Tomorrow tomorrow is another day.Clambering into bed, I switch off the light and lie staring up at the ceiling.Oh, I wish Id never met him.My inner goddess shakes her head at me.She and I know its a lie.I have never felt as alive as I do now.I close my eyes, and I drift into a heavy sleep with occasional dreams of four poster beds and shackles and intense gray eyes.Kate wakes me the next day.Ana, Ive been calling you.You must have been out cold.My eyes reluctantly open.Shes not just up  shes been for a run.I glance at my alarm.Its eight in the morning.Holy Moses, Ive slept for a solid nine hours.What is it?I mumble sleepily.Theres a man here with a delivery for you.You have to sign for it.What?Come on.Its big.It looks interesting.She hops from foot to foot excitedly and bounds back into the living area.I clamber out of bed and grab my dressing gown hanging on the back of my door.A smart young man with a ponytail is standing in our living room clasping a large box.Hi, I mumble.Ill make you some tea.Kate scuttles off to the kitchen.Miss Steele?And I immediately know whom the parcel is from.Yes, I answer cautiously.I have a package for you here, but I have to set it up and show you how to use it.Really?At this time?Only following orders, maam.He smiles in a charming but professional hes not taking any crap way.Did he just call me maam?Have I aged ten years overnight?If I have, its that contract.My mouth puckers in disgust.Okay, what is it?Its a MacBook Pro.Of course it is.I roll my eyes .These arent available in the shops yet, maam, the very latest from Apple.How come that does not surprise me?I sigh heavily.Just set it up on the dining table over there.I wander into the kitchen to join Kate.What is it?she says inquisitive, bright eyed and bushy tailed.Shes slept well too.Its a laptop from Christian.Whys he sent you a laptop?You know you can use mine, she frowns.Not for what he has in mind.Oh, its only on loan.He wanted me to try it out.My excuse sounds feeble.But Kate nods her assent.Oh my I have hoodwinked Katherine Kavanagh.A first.She hands me my tea.The Mac laptop is sleek and silver and rather beautiful.It has a very large screen.Christian Grey likes scale  I think of his living area, in fact, his whole apartment.Its got the latest OS and a full suite of programs, plus a one point five terabyte hard drive so youll have plenty of room, thirty two gigs of RAM  what are you planning to use it for?Uh email.Email!he chokes, bemused, raising his eyebrows with a slightly sick look on his face.And maybe Internet research?I shrug apologetically.He sighs.Well, this has full wireless N, and Ive set it up with your Me account details.This baby is all ready to go, practically anywhere on the planet.He looks longingly at it.Me account?Your new email address.I have an email address?He points to an icon on the screen and continues to talk at me but its like white noise.I havent got a clue what hes saying, and in all honestly, Im not interested.Just tell me how to switch it on and off  Ill figure out the rest.After all, Ive been using Kates for four years.Kate whistles, impressed when she sees it.This is next generation tech.She raises her eyebrows at me.Most women get flowers or maybe jewelry, she says suggestively, trying to suppress a smile.I scowl at her but cant keep a straight face.We both burst into a fit of giggles, and computer man gapes at us, bemused.He finishes up and asks me to sign the delivery note.As Kate shows him out, I sit with my cup of tea, open the email program, and sitting there waiting for me is an email from Christian.My heart leaps into my mouth.I have an email from Christian Grey.Nervously, I open it.From: Christian Grey  Subject: Your New Computer  Date: May 22 2011

Mr.and Mrs.Clayton will probably cut me some slack.I race into the shower, unable to shake my face splitting grin.He emailed me.Im like a small, giddy child.And all the contract angst fades.As I wash my hair, I try and think what I could possibly ask him via email.Surely its better to talk these things through.Suppose someone hacked into his account?I flush at the thought.I dress quickly, shout a hasty goodbye to Kate, and Im off to work my last week at Claytons.Jos phones at eleven.Hey, are we doing coffee?He sounds like the old Jos.Jos my friend, not a  what did Christian call him?Suitor.Ugh.Sure.Im at work.Can you make it here for say twelve?See you then.He hangs up, and I go back to restocking the paintbrushes and thinking about Christian Grey and his contract.Jos is punctual.He comes bounding into the shop like a gamboling dark eyed puppy.Ana, he smiles his dazzling toothy all Hispanic American smile, and I cant be angry with him anymore.Hi Jos.I hug him.Im starving.Ill just let Mrs.Clayton know Im going for lunch.As we stroll to the local coffee shop, I slip my arm through Joss.Im so grateful for his   normality.Someone I know and understand.Hey Ana, he murmurs.Youve really forgiven me?Jos, you know I can never stay mad at you for long.He grins.I cant wait to get home.The lure of emailing Christian, and maybe I can begin my research project.Kate is out somewhere, so I fire up the new laptop and open my email.Sure enough, theres an email from Christian sitting in the inbox.Im practically bouncing out of my seat with glee.From: Christian Grey

Bossy!Date: May 23 2011 18:04  To: Christian Grey  Yes Sir.You are so bossy.Ana  From: Christian Grey  Subject: In Control  Date: May 23 2011 18:06  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia, you have no idea.Well, maybe an inkling now.Do the work.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.I type Submissive into Wikipedia.Half an hour later, I feel slight queasy and frankly shocked to my core.Do I really want this stuff in my head?Jeez  is this what he gets up to in the Red Room of Pain?I sit staring at the screen, and part of me, a very moist and integral part of me  that Ive only become acquainted with very recently, is seriously turned on.Oh my, some of this stuff is HOT.But is it for me?Holy shit could I do this?I need space.I need to think.For the first time in my life, I voluntarily go for a run.I find my nasty, never used sneakers, some sweat pants, and a t shirt.I put my hair in pigtails, blushing at the memories they bring back, and I plug in my iPod.I cant sit in front of that marvel of technology and look at or read any more disturbing material.I need to expend some of this excess, enervating, energy.Quite frankly, I have a mind to run to the Heathman hotel and just demand sex from the control freak.But thats five miles, and I dont think Ill be able to run one mile, let alone five, and of course, he might turn me down which would be beyond humiliating.Kate is walking from her car as I head out of the door.She nearly drops her shopping when she sees me.Ana Steele in sneakers.I wave and dont stop for the inquisition.I need some serious alone time.Snow Patrol blaring in my ears, I set off into the opal and aquamarine dusk.I pace through the park.What am I going to do?I want him, but on his terms?I just dont know.Perhaps I should negotiate what I want.Go through that ridiculous contract line by line and say what is acceptable and what isnt.My research has told me that legally its unenforceable.He must know that.I figure that it just sets up the parameters of the relationship.It illustrates what I can expect from him and what he expects from me  my total submission.Am I prepared to give him that?Am I even capable?I am plagued by one question   why is he like this?Is it because he was seduced at such a young age?I just dont know.Hes still such a mystery.I stop beside a large spruce and put my hands on my knees, breathing hard, dragging precious air into my lungs.Oh, this feels good, cathartic.I can feel my resolve hardening.Yes.I need to tell him whats okay and what isnt.I need to email him my thoughts, and then we can discuss these on Wednesday.I take a deep cleansing breath, then jog back to the apartment.Kate has been shopping, as only she can, for clothes for her holiday to Barbados.Mainly bikinis and matching sarongs.She will look fabulous in all of them, yet she still makes me sit and comment while she tries on each and every one.There are only so many ways one can say  you look fabulous Kate.She has a curvy, slim figure to die for.She doesnt do it on purpose, I know, but I haul my sorry, perspiration clad, old t shirt, sweat pants, and sneakers ass into my room on the pretext of packing more boxes.Could I feel any more inadequate?Taking the awesome free technology with me, I set the laptop up on my desk.I email Christian.__________________________________________________________________   From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Shocked of WSUV  Date: May 23 2011 20:33  To: Christian Grey  Okay, Ive seen enough.It was nice knowing you.Ana  I press send, hugging myself, laughing at my little joke.Will he find it as funny?Oh shit   probably not.Christian Grey is not famed for his sense of humor.But I know it exists, Ive experienced it.Perhaps Ive gone too far.I wait for his answer.I wait and wait.I glance at my alarm clock.Ten minutes have passed.To distract myself from the anxiety that blooms in my belly, I start doing what I told Kate I would be doing  packing up my room.I begin by cramming my books into a crate.By nine, Ive heard nothing.Perhaps hes out.I pout petulantly as I plug my iPod ear buds in, listen to Snow Patrol, and sit down at my small desk to re read the contract and make my comments.I dont know why I glance up, maybe I catch a slight movement from the corner of my eye, I dont know, but when I do, hes standing in the doorway of my bedroom watching me intently.Hes wearing his grey flannel pants and a white linen shirt, gently twirling his car keys.I pull my ear buds out and freeze .Fuck!Good evening, Anastasia.His voice is cool, his expression completely guarded and unreadable.The capacity to speak deserts me.Damn Kate for letting him in here with no warning.Vaguely, Im aware that Im still in my sweats, un showered, yucky, and hes just gloriously yummy, his pants doing that hanging from the hips thing, and whats more, hes here in my bedroom.I felt that your email warranted a reply in person, he explains dryly.I open my mouth and then close it again, twice.The joke is on me.Never in this or any alternative universe did I expect him to drop everything and turn up here.May I sit?he asks, his eyes now dancing with humor  thank heavens  maybe hell see the funny side?I nod.The power of speech remains elusive.Christian Grey is sitting on my bed.I wondered what your bedroom would look like, he says.I glance around it, plotting an escape route, no  theres still only the door or window.My room is functional but cozy  sparse white wicker furniture and a white iron double bed with a patchwork quilt, made by my mother when she was in her folksy American quilting phase.Its all pale blue and cream.Its very serene and peaceful in here, he murmurs.Not at the moment not with you here.Finally, my medulla oblongata recalls its purpose, I breathe.How ?He smiles at me.Im still at the Heathman.I know that.Would you like a drink?Politeness wins out over everything else Id like to say.No, thank you, Anastasia.He smiles a dazzling, crooked smile, his head cocked slightly to one side.Well, I might need one.So, it was nice knowing me?Holy cow, is he offended?I stare down at my fingers.How am I going to dig myself out of this?If I tell him it was a joke, I dont think hell be impressed.I thought youd reply by email.My voice is small, pathetic.Are you biting your lower lip deliberately?he asks darkly.I blink up at him, gasping, freeing my lip.I wasnt aware I was biting my lip, I murmur softly.My heart is pounding.I can feel that pull, that delicious electricity between us charging, filling the space between us with static.Hes sitting so close to me, his eyes dark smoky gray, his elbows resting on his knees, his legs apart.Leaning forward, he slowly undoes one of my pigtails, his fingers freeing my hair.My breathing is shallow, and I cannot move.I watch hypnotized as his hand moves to my second pigtail, and pulling the hair tie, he loosens the braid with his long, skilled fingers.So you decided on some exercise, he breathes, his voice soft and melodious.His fingers gently tuck my hair behind my ear.Why, Anastasia?His fingers circle my ear, and very softly, he tugs my earlobe, rhythmically.Its so sexual.I needed time to think, I whisper.Im all rabbit/headlights, moth/flame, bird/snake  and he knows exactly what hes doing to me.Think about what, Anastasia?You.And you decided that it was nice knowing me?Do you mean knowing me in the biblical sense?Oh shit.I flush.I didnt think you were familiar with the Bible.I went to Sunday School, Anastasia.It taught me a great deal.I dont remember reading about nipple clamps in the Bible.Perhaps you were taught from a modern translation.His lips arch with a trace of a smile, and my eyes are drawn to his beautiful sculptured mouth.Well, I thought I should come and remind you how nice it was knowing me.Holy crap.I stare at him open mouthed, and his fingers move from my ear to my chin.What do you say to that, Miss Steele?His gray eyes blaze at me, his challenge intrinsic in his stare.His lips are parted  hes waiting, coiled to strike.Desire  acute, liquid and smoldering, combusts deep in my belly.I take pre emptive action and launch myself at him.Somehow he moves, I have no idea how, and in the blink of an eye Im on the bed pinned beneath him, my arms stretched out and held above my head, his free hand clutching my face, and his mouth finds mine.His tongue is in my mouth, claiming and possessing me, and I revel in the force he uses.I feel him against the length of my body.He wants me, and this does strange, delicious things to my insides.Not Kate in her little bikinis, not one of the fifteen, not evil Mrs.Robinson.Me.This beautiful man wants me.My inner goddess glows so bright she could light up Portland.He stops kissing me, and opening my eyes, I find him gazing down at me.Trust me?he breathes.I nod, wide eyed, my heart bouncing off my ribs, my blood thundering around my body.He reaches down, and from his pants pocket, he takes out his silver grey silk tie that silver grey woven tie that leaves small impressions of its weave on my skin.He moves so quickly, sitting astride me as he fastens my wrists together, but this time, he ties the other end of the tie to one of the spokes of my white iron headboard.He pulls at my binding checking its secure.Im not going anywhere.Im tied, literally, to my bed, and Im so aroused.He slides off me and stands beside the bed, staring down at me, his eyes dark with want.His look is triumphant, mixed with relief.Thats better, he murmurs and smiles a wicked, knowing smile.He bends and starts undoing one of my sneakers.Oh no no my feet.No.Ive just been running.No, I protest, trying to kick him off.He stops.If you struggle, Ill tie your feet too.If you make a noise, Anastasia, I will gag you.Keep quiet.Katherine is probably outside listening right now.Gag me!Kate!I shut up.He removes my shoes and my socks efficiently and slowly peels off my sweat pants.Oh  what panties am I wearing?He lifts me and pulls the quilt and my duvet out from underneath me and places me back down, this time on the sheets.Now then.He licks his bottom lip slowly.Youre biting that lip, Anastasia.You know the effect it has on me.He places his long index finger over my mouth, a warning.Oh my.I can barely contain myself, lying helpless, watching him move gracefully around my room, its a heady aphrodisiac.Slowly, almost leisurely, he removes his shoes and socks, undoes his pants, and lifts his shirt off over his head.I think youve seen too much, he chuckles slyly.He sits astride me again, pulls my t shirt up, and I think hes going to take it off me, but he rolls it up to my neck and then pulls it up over my head so he can see my mouth and my nose, but it covers my eyes.And because its folded over  I cannot see a thing through it.Mmm, he breathes appreciatively.This just gets better and better.Im going to get a drink.Leaning down, he kisses me, his lips tender against mine, and his weight shifts off the bed.I hear the quiet creak of the bedroom door.Get a drink.Where?Here?Portland?Seattle?I strain to hear him.I can make out low rumblings, and I know hes talking to Kate  oh no hes practically naked.Whats she going to say?I hear a faint popping sound.Whats that?He returns, the door creaking once more, his feet padding across the bedroom floor, and ice tinkling against glass as it swirls in liquid.What kind of drink?He shuts the door and shuffles around removing his pants.They drop to the floor, and I know hes naked.He sits astride me again.Are you thirsty, Anastasia?he asks, his voice teasing  Yes, I breathe, because my mouth is suddenly parched.I hear the ice clink against the glass, and he puts it down again and leans down and kisses me, pouring a delicious crisp, liquid into my mouth as he does.Its white wine.Its so unexpected, hot, though its chilled, and Christians lips are cool.More?he whispers.I nod.It tastes all the more divine because its been in his mouth.He leans down, and I drink another mouthful from his lips oh my.Lets not go too far, we know your capacity for alcohol is limited, Anastasia.I cant help it.I grin, and he leans down to deliver another delicious mouthful.He shifts so hes lying beside me, his erection at my hip.Oh, I want him inside me.Is this nice?he asks, but I hear the edge in his voice.I tense.He moves the glass again and leans down, kissing me and depositing a small shard of ice in my mouth with a little wine.He slowly and leisurely trails chilled kisses down the center of my body, from the base of my throat, between my breasts, down my torso, and to my belly.He pops a fragment of ice in my navel in a pool of cool, cold wine.It burns all the way down to the depths of my belly.Wow.Now you have to keep still, he whispers.If you move, Anastasia, youll get wine all over the bed.My hips flex automatically.Oh no.If you spill the wine, I will punish you, Miss Steele.I groan and desperately fight the urge to tilt my hips, pulling on my restraint.Oh no  please.With one finger, he pulls down my bra cups in turn, my breasts pushed up, exposed and vulnerable.Leaning down, he kisses and tugs at each of my nipples in turn with cool, cold lips.I fight my body as it tries to arch in response.How nice is this?he breathes, blowing on one of my nipples.I hear another clink of ice, and then I can feel it round my right nipple as he tugs the left one with his lips.I moan, struggling not to move.Its sweet, agonizing torture.If you spill the wine, I wont let you come,  Oh please Christian Sir Please.Hes driving me insane.I hear him smile.The ice in my navel is melting.I am beyond warm  warm and chilled and wanting.Wanting him, inside me.Now.His cool fingers trail languidly across my belly.My skin is oversensitive, my hips flex automatically, and the now warmer liquid from my navel seeps over my belly.Christian moves quickly, lapping it up with his tongue, kissing, biting me softly, sucking.Oh dear, Anastasia, you moved.What am I going to do to you?Im panting loudly.All I can concentrate on is his voice and his touch.Nothing else is real.Nothing else matters, nothing else registers on my radar.His fingers slip into my panties, and Im rewarded with his unguarded sharp intake of air.Oh, baby, he murmurs and he pushes two fingers inside me.I gasp.Ready for me so soon, he says.He moves his fingers tantalizingly slowly, in, out, and I push against him, tilting my hips up.You are a greedy girl, he scolds softly, and his thumb circles my clitoris and then presses down.I groan loudly as my body bucks beneath his expert fingers.He reaches up and pushes the t shirt over my head so I can see him as I blink in the soft light of my sidelight.I long to touch him.I want to touch you, I breathe.I know, he murmurs.He leans down and kisses me, his fingers still moving rhythmically inside me, his thumb circling and pressing.His other hand scoops my hair off my head and holds my head in place.His tongue mirrors the actions of his fingers, claiming me.My legs begin to stiffen as I push against his hand.He gentles his hand, so Im brought back from the brink.He does this again and again.Its so frustrating Oh please Christian, I scream in my head.This is your punishment, so close and yet so far.Is this nice?he breathes in my ear.I whimper, exhausted, pulling against my restraint.Im helpless, lost in an erotic torment.Please, I beg, and he finally takes pity on me.How shall I fuck you, Anastasia?Oh my body starts to quiver.He stills again.Please.What do you want, Anastasia?You now, I cry.Shall I fuck you this way, or this way, or this way?Theres an endless choice, he breathes against my lips.He withdraws his hand and reaches over to the bedside table for a foil packet.He kneels up between my legs, and very slowly he pulls my panties off, staring down at me, his eyes gleaming.He puts on the condom.I watch fascinated, mesmerized.How nice is this?he says as he strokes himself.I meant it as a joke, I whimper.Please fuck me, Christian.He raises his eyebrows as his hand moves up and down his impressive length.A joke?His voice is menacingly soft.Yes.Please, Christian, I beseech him.Are you laughing now?No, I mewl.I am just one ball of sexual, tense, need.He stares down at me for a moment, measur ing my need, then he grabs me suddenly and flips me over.It takes me by surprise, and because my hands are tied, I have to support myself on my elbows.He pushes both my knees up the bed so my behind is in the air, and he slaps me hard.Before I can react, he plunges inside me.I cry out  from the slap and from his sudden assault, and I come instantly again and again, falling apart beneath him as he continues to slam deliciously into me.He doesnt stop.Im spent.I cant take this and he pounds on and on and on...then Im building again surely not no  Come on, Anastasia, again, he growls through clenched teeth, and unbelievably, my body responds, convulsing around him as I climax anew, calling out his name.I shatter again into tiny fragments, and Christian stills, finally letting go, silently finding his release.He collapses on top of me, breathing hard.How nice was that?he asks through his gritted teeth.Oh my.I lie panting and spent on the bed, eyes closed as he slowly pulls out of me.He rises immediately and dresses.When hes fully clothed, he climbs back on the bed and gently undoes his tie and pulls my t shirt off.I flex my fingers and rub my wrists, smiling at the woven pattern imprinted on my wrists from the tie.I re adjust my bra as he pulls the duvet and quilt over me.I stare up at him completely dazed, and he smirks down at me.That was really nice, I whisper, smiling coyly.Theres that word again.You dont like that word?No.It doesnt do it for me at all.Oh  I dont know it seems to have a very beneficial effect on you.Im a beneficial effect, now am I?Could you wound my ego any further, Miss Steele?I dont think theres anything wrong with your ego.But even as I say it, I dont feel the conviction of my words   something elusive crosses my mind, a fleeting thought, but its lost before I can grasp it.You think?His voice is soft.Hes lying beside me, fully clothed, his head propped up on his elbow, and I am only wearing my bra.Why dont you like to be touched?I just dont.He reaches over and plants a soft kiss on my forehead.So, that email was your idea of a joke.I smile apologetically at him and shrug.I see.So you are still considering my proposition?Your indecent proposal yes I am.I have issues though.He grins down at me as if relieved.Id be disappointed if you didnt.I was going to email them to you, but you kind of interrupted me.Coitus Interruptus.See, I knew you had a sense of humor somewhere in there.I smile.Only certain things are funny, Anastasia.I thought you were saying no, no discussion at all.His voice drops.I dont know yet.I havent made up my mind.Will you collar me?He raises his eyebrows.You have been doing your research.I dont know, Anastasia.Ive never collared anyone.
