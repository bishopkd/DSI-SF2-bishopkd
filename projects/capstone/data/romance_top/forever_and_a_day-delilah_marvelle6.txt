He whipped back toward the direction of the closet just 						beyond the kitchen where she already stood in her calico gown, her hair 						neatly bundled and her feet bare.It appeared she had been awake for some 						time.My father is here, he 						whispered in disbelief, holding up the weighty satchel.He wanted you to 						have this.A lone tear spilled its way down 						her cheek.She nodded and swiped at it.All that matters is that youve 						found what I had lost.Tis good to know you have a father.Tis more than 						good, actually.Tis absolutely marvelous.He tossed the satchel toward the 						table with a thudding chink and stepped toward her, unfolding his arms.Come 						here, Georgia.Come here, before I tell everyone to leave.She let out a sob, hurried 						toward him and flung herself into his arms, pressing him tightly against 						herself.I told you someone would come.She dug her entire face harder 						into his chest and tightened her hold.I told you.That you did.He pressed the 						side of her soft cheek against his chest and held her for a long moment, 						praying this wouldnt be the last time hed hold her.It would seem I am 						bound to far more than wealth.She leaned back and searched his 						face, still clinging to him.What do you mean?He swallowed.I am a lord, and 						my father, who is waiting downstairs, appears to be a duke.She gasped, her eyes widening, 						and scrambled out of his arms.A trembling hand drifted up to her mouth.She 						stared as if she no longer knew who he was.The world faded as if he were 						being dragged into a reality he didnt want to be a part of.Dont look at 						me like that.Im still the same man.I knew you had money, but I 						never once thought you were somearisto.She dropped her hand to her side.Mother on high, had I known I most certainly wouldnt have She stepped 						toward him, looking panicked.We cant have you lookin like this.Your 						father is goin to blame your wretched appearance on me.He lowered his chin.You do 						realize you just insulted my appearance?Oh, hush up and stand still.Stuffing his linen shirt into his trousers, she smoothed it against his 						chest and shoulders, before readjusting his trousers on his hips with a firm 						tug.There.Now  She turned, grabbed up his boots 						from beside the chair and set them before him with a thud.Put your boots 						on.Ill go get a rag to polish them.She grabbed the other, small satchel 						from off the table, the one containing his fob, and shoved it into his hand.Dont forget this.It has your money and your watch in it.Maybe now youll 						be able to find the key that winds it.Turning, she jogged into the front 						room and disappeared.Only Georgia would think of 						winding a watch at a time like this.He glanced back at her.Georgia.Put on your boots, she called 						back, knowing he hadnt.He heaved out a breath.Lowering 						his gaze to those boots, he leaned over and yanked each boot on, dreading 						everything that awaited him.It would be like waking up in the hospital 						again.Not knowing who or what to expect.What if he didnt recognize his 						own father?What if he never recognized the man?Georgia reappeared with not only 						a wet rag, but his waistcoat, coat and brush in hand.Put them on.Apologize to your father about the buttons.Will he want them back?Should I 						go dig them out?I should, shouldnt I?Theyre silver.He slipped into his embroidered 						waistcoat, which she had laundered and dried for him all but yesterday.I 						dont think hell want them.They are, after all, my buttons.Not his.He 						pulled on his coat, adjusting them both against his body and sighed.Better?Much.Lower your head for me.She turned him toward herself and reached up, brushing his hair back and out 						of his eyes with several quick strokes.She stepped back, smacking the brush 						against the palm of her hand and set her chin.There.Much better.Now 						stand still.Tossing aside the brush with a 						clatter, she kneeled before him on the wood floor and bent toward him, 						polishing his black leather boots with a rag as if she were now his 						servant.His eyes widened.Georgia, 						what?He leaned down and yanked her savagely back onto her feet, causing 						her to stumble.He shook her.What the hell are you doing?She scrambled back, tightening 						her hold on the dirty, wet rag she clutched, and awkwardly replied, Now I 						wont get arrested for treatin you like a hog.He captured her gaze, his throat 						tightening.You treated me like a damn king.In that breath and in that 						moment, he knew he could never live without her.Not even if he were married with 						fourteen children.Jesus, he was fucked.I want you to meet him.I want you 						to come downstairs with me.Come.Her brows pinched together as 						she stepped farther back and shook her head.He doesnt want to meet me.She tossed aside the dirty rag and smoothed her hands against her gown.I 						dont even own a gown worth bein seen in.She edged back, her cheeks 						flushing.Im sorry I made you live like this.I really am.He fought the need to grab her 						and shake her for saying such a thing.Cease.He held out an impatient 						hand.Now come.Youre going with me.Dont do this to me, Robinson.Please dont.She pushed him toward the door, making him stumble against 						her weight.What if youre married?Ill not be the cause of a broken 						marriage.He leaned back toward her, 						clutching the small leather satchel hard.What if I am unwed?What if I am 						free to love you?What then?Will you have me?Tears now streamed down her pale 						face, reddening those pretty green eyes.A man such as you, belongin to 						the duty of nobility and wealth, could never be free to love a woman like 						me.Dont you see that?His eyes widened.She didnt 						even sound like herself.Are you being blinded by something as stupid as 						status and wealth?Do you really want the west?Or do you really want 						me?Tis as 						simple as that.She swiped away her tears.Stop 						it, she choked out.She swung away.I havent the right to impose what I 						want upon you.His throat burned in an effort 						to keep himself from grabbing her and shaking the wits out of her.People 						who love each other will impose upon each other.That is the price and 						burden of love.Unless, of courseyou dont love me.This isnt about love, 						Robinson.Then what is it about?Rancor sharpened his voice.She shook her head again.Regardless of whether you see it or not, Ill only be a woman you dragged 						out of the mud and Ill not do that to you or myself.Ill not hang our 						dignity like this.I just wont.He leaned toward her and hit the 						satchel he was holding against his chest.Our dignity?Our dignity?Dignity 						wont mean a goddamn thing if were not together!A sob escaped her.Thats 						because you dont know what its like to live without dignity.But I do, 						Robinson.Ive been livin without it since I took my first breath and Ill 						not do that to you.Ill not.She clamped a hand to her mouth and quickly 						veered out of sight, into the front room of her tenement.Georgia?he echoed after her.Come with me.Please.Silence pulsed.He swallowed, sensing that John 						and all four of the uniformed men were holding their breaths right along 						with him.It was degrading having his entire life fall apart before the eyes 						of men that he didnt even know.Robinson lingered in the doorway, staring 						straight into her kitchen at the hanging rosary there on the far wall, and 						silently willed whatever God there was to get her to bend to his 						command.He waited and waited, swallowing 						back his disbelief.When she still didnt reappear, he reached out and 						slammed the door shut lest he grab her and force her into coming with 						him.Through heaving breaths and a 						heavy limbed haze, he lingered in the corridor as everyone silently awaited 						whatever was about to happen.It was pathetic.He was pathetic.Robinson swung away from her 						closed door and tossed the satchel he was holding over to John, who was 						barely two feet away.Take this with an apology for the fist I gave 						you.John paused and snapped it back 						out toward him.Nah, I was the one who  Just keep Georgia out of 						trouble.That is all I ask.Robinson turned and shoved past 						everyone.He pounded his way down the 						narrow stairs that led out toward the open entrance door.Thunder grumbled 						restlessly in the distance beyond the rushing rain as a strong, cool breeze 						forced its way in through the open door.When he reached the bottom 						stair, he paused and then veered toward the uneven plastered wall, wistfully 						sliding the tips of his fingers against it, wishing he could recapture that 						breathtaking moment when Georgia had made him believe that he was the only 						man she would ever love.He strode out of the tenement 						and onto the pavement, rain pelting his head, face and shoulders, soaking 						his morning coat within moments.A footman in a bright red uniform stood in 						the rain, his polished black boots encased in the mud road.He held the door 						open to a large black lacquered carriage.Pausing a few steps away from 						the carriage, he allowed the cold rain to soak him and numb what little he 						felt.Georgia hadnt even fought half a breath for him.She, who wore a 						blade on her thigh and took on the world with fists and words to match, had 						set it all aside the moment it came to him.She obviously had never come to 						love him in the way he had come to love her.An older gentlemans rugged face 						appeared, leaning far forward in the cushioned seat, a folded white 						handkerchief pressed against his nose and mouth.His silver tonic sleeked 						hair glinted from the movement.Dark brown eyes widened as the 						man scanned the length of him.Lowering the handkerchief with a black 						leather gloved hand, the older gentleman rose from his seat, revealing full 						black attire from boot to shoulder, save his linen shirt and a white cravat.The man quickly leaned out of the door and waved toward the young footman 						still holding the door open.Get him out of this rain, Gilmore!he 						shouted, his pale features flushing.Now!The footman rushed toward 						Robinson and grabbed hold of his arm, hurrying him at a jog toward the open 						door of the carriage and up the unfolded stairs.Robinson stumbled in and 						fell against the seat opposite the older man as the stairs were quickly 						folded back into place.The door was slammed shut, encasing Robinson in a 						world of gray velvet that smelled like mulled spice and cedar.He paused, glancing at nothing 						in particular.He knew that smell.It belonged to his life.It belonged to 						the life of Viscount Roderick Gideon Tremayne.He sucked in a breath, 						bringing up a trembling hand to his temple.His name.He knew his name.It 						wasnt Robinson at all.It wasRoderick.He was Lord Roderick Gideon 						Tremayne.He swallowed and glanced at the man lingering before him.Why was 						it he had a name in his head but nothing else?The duke scrambled out of his 						black morning coat and stumbled to his booted feet.Draping Roderick with 						his own coat, the duke leaned toward him and touched his face.Yardley, he 						choked out, sitting beside him.Assure me you were treated 					well.Yardley?Roderick echoed, trying not to panic.You mean my 						name isnt Tremayne?Who the hell is Tremayne?The man paused and blinked 						rapidly.Tremayne is still you.Tis simply only one of your titles.As is 						Yardley.A breath escaped him.I see.At least a part of his mind belonged to him.Call me Tremayne.Please.I 						dont know why, but I prefer it.Fine.Yes.The man grasped his 						wrist with gloved fingers, gently bringing his bandaged hand toward himself.What happened?Dr.Carter didnt mention any injuries to your hand.Is it 						serious?Hardly.I scraped some skin 						off, that is all.Roderick drew away his hand and set it back into his own 						lap.Might we go?I dont care to linger.The duke grabbed his arm, his 						fingers pinching the wet skin beneath his linen shirt.Will you cease with 						this morbid nonchalance?Youve been missing for twelve days.Twelve!Ive had 						countless men scouring this city since your valet informed me you had never 						returned from your walk that afternoon.Twas only blessed chance the owner 						of the Adelphi had personally delivered yesterdays newspaper into my hands 						knowing that I was paying hordes of men, including the watch and all of its 						marshals, to hunt you down!Roderick awkwardly glanced 						toward him, trying to understand what type of relationship he had with his 						father.Forgive me for the heartache I have brought you.The man released his arm.All 						that matters is that you are safe.Were leaving.Do you understand?Difficult though it may be for me to accept, given who he is and what he 						meant to your mother, we are done trying to convince Atwood to return with 						us to England.Tis his God given right to stay behind and lead whatever 						life he chooses.He sunk farther into his seat in 						utter confusion.Atwood?Who is Atwood?The dukes eyes widened.He 						jerked toward him, searching his face.You mean you really dont 						remember?No.I dont.The man paused, still searching 						his face.But you remember why we left London?Yes?An eerie feeling clamped his 						gut.No.I dont.The duke hissed out a breath, 						momentarily closing his eyes, pinching his gloved fingers into his forehead.Dr.Carter warned me of your condition, but I How does a man lose all that 						he is in a single breath?Reopening his eyes, he dropped his hand to his 						side and shifted toward him, his features twisting.You do remember me, 						though, yes?Given that you are acknowledging me?Roderick swallowed.Im sorry 						to say that I dont.The duke leaned closer toward 						him, bringing with him the tangy scent of cigars, and lowered his voice.Try harder, Tremayne.A son should always remember his father.Always.Leaning back against the seat, 						Roderick whispered achingly, Forgive me.It isnt by choice that I cannot 						remember.His Grace rapidly blinked back 						tears.He glanced away and eventually said in a choked tone, You look 						half dead.Ill have the valet clean you up when we get to the hotel.We 						will be leaving on the next Red Star Line, which is in ten days time.Fortunately, I didnt cancel those tickets.Snatching up a cane from the 						seat before them with a trembling hand, the duke used the gold head to knock 						on the roof of the carriage before angling it against the seat.The carriage rolled forward, 						causing Roderick to sway against the sudden movement of the seat.He was 						leaving Georgia behind.She was going out west and he was going God knows 						where with a man he couldnt even remember.Still in disbelief, he glanced 						toward the rain sleeked glass window.A fleeting distorted image of Georgia 						rushing out of the tenement and into the rain in bare feet made him sit 						up.She dashed toward the carriage, 						sliding against the mud, her head appearing well below the window as she 						jumped up in an effort to try to see him.Robinson!she shouted, her small 						bare hand popping up and hitting the glass of the carriage as it slowly 						rolled its way past faster and faster.She darted alongside the carriage to 						keep up, her lopsided, red bundled hair sagging against the downpour.If 						youre not married or involved with any women, come back.If youll have me, 						come back.Ill be here another week before headin west!A sob escaped her 						as she fell back and disappeared, letting the carriage roll away.His breath caught in his throat 						as the clatter of the wheels and the rushing of rain muted all sound.She 						loved him.He knew everything between them had been real.He knew it 						had.He jerked toward the man beside 						him.Am I married or involved with any women?An astonished laugh escaped the 						dukes lips as he glanced away from the window and back toward him.I 						Well You had a mistress you dragged over from Paris to distract 						you from obsessing over your brothers wife, but dismissed the woman when we 						left for New York.Is that what you wanted to know?He choked.My brothers wife?I 						have a brother?And what do you mean I was obsessing over his wife?Do you 						mean to tell me Im involved with his wife?The dukes features darkened.You had a 						brother, Tremayne.And yes, you were involved with his wife.But that is 						alldone with.Roderick threw back his head and 						raked his hands through his hair.That is why he was wearing a mourning 						band.The one Georgia had asked him about in Dr.Carters office.The one he 						didnt even remember wearing.Hed been in mourning for his own brother.Dearest God.What sort of man beds his own brothers wife?He was an asshole 						and couldnt even remember being one!When would his life be his own and 						feel real?When?He leveled his head and pushed 						out the breath he was holding.How he prayed Georgia would still love him, 						despite what he had once been, because he wasnt the man his father spoke of 						anymore.He wasnt.Nor would he be again.Roderick flung the coat from 						himself and jumped toward the door.Stop the carriage.Now.What for?Im engaged, he rasped.Now 						stop this carriage.The duke leaned toward him and 						grabbed his shoulders, shaking him twice.Get ahold of yourself.Those 						brown eyes searched his face.You are not 						engaged.I am as of this moment.I wish 						to be formally engaged to Mrs.Georgia Emily Milton.The widow of Raymond 						Milton and a woman I simply cannot and will not live without.The dukes eyes widened.The 						one I just handed gold to?The one Dr.Carter kept telling me was charming 						but next to bloody mad?If she is mad, Your Grace, then 						the entire world is, too.She took me in and gave me a home and a mind when 						I had none and I am madly in love with her.His Grace gasped, his aged face 						flushing.Youve only been gone for twelve days.Not twelve 					years.Time means nothing when two 						souls are perfectly matched.Now I am asking that you stop this carriage so 						that I may bring my fiance home with me.The dukes brown eyes intently 						held his gaze.You may not remember who and what you are but that does not 						change who and what you once were and what you must continue to be.You are the 						sole heir to a dukedom.Do you understand?This woman has no place in your 						world and I will not permit you to degrade yourself and all that we 						represent.Roderick swayed, fighting the 						nausea seizing him.I will set aside everything to make her my wife.I 						will.Even you.Even my name.Let there be no doubt in that.The duke narrowed his gaze and 						pointed at him rigidly with a black gloved finger.If you go against me in 						this, Yardley, I will strip you of everything, including your yearly 						annuity, and you will be left with nothing.Is that what you 					want?Roderick let out a shaky breath 						and forced more power into his voice.I am not leaving her behind.Im 						not.The duke dropped his hand to his 						thigh and lowered his shaven chin against his knotted silk cravat.After a 						long moment, he confided, When you marry, Tremayne, it will be a woman 						worthy of your name and your status.Not this.Notthis.Roderick shifted toward him.She is 						worthy.Upon all that I am, I swear to you, she is.The duke stared at him.You 						arent even in your own damn mind anymore, boy.The duke waved toward the 						rain slathered window revealing distorted dilapidated wood buildings.I 						take it this is Park Lane to you now?Roderick shifted his jaw.Do 						not mistake what she and I share.You know nothing of it.The duke closed his eyes as if 						unable to look at him anymore and said in a barely contained voice, Leave 						her here and dont complicate your life or mine.I will not say it again.I 						would sooner disown you than see you marry into a mess.Roderick was more ready to fling 						himself into the arms of poverty and allow his hands to bleed every day on 						the hour knowing Georgia would be there to kiss it all away, but he 						refused to 						let Georgia live in the poverty that had quietly eaten away not only her 						pride, but the faith she had in herself as a woman and as a human being.He 						would change her life knowing that he was of status and of wealth and in 						time prove to this staunch man that Georgia deserved far more than 						dirt.Roderick leaned toward him and 						said in a tone that he hoped was rational and persuasive, Ill take her to 						London, then.As my mistress.Tremayne, for Gods 						sake  Are you informing me I am not 						permitted to take a wife or a mistress?The duke gaped.You mean to 						actually drag this woman all the way to London?Yes.Now pray convey, what is 						the amount of this yearly annuity you spoke of earlier?I must ensure she 						has everything.And I do mean everything.In this, I will not desist.I am 						not leaving without her.Im not.Those brown eyes hardened, no 						longer allowing for sympathy.Your annuity is nine thousand a year, not 						including what you inherited from your brother.It should be more than 						enough, unless she plans to eat a barrel of gold on the hour.Roderick stared him down.There 						is no need for you to insult her.Now stop this carriage so that I may fetch 						her.Unless, of course, you prefer I altogether stay and abandon my duty to 						you and my name.Because I will.Do you think it matters if I live in a sty 						knowing my heart is feasting like a king?Better mud than death to what 						little remains of my mind and my heart.The duke lowered his gaze, his 						gloved hand visibly trembling as he reached out and grabbed hold of his 						cane, yanking it up with a single sweep.You and your heart will be the 						death of us both.Christ, do you ever remind me of myself in my younger 						years.Tis a curse, is what.He hit the roof twice with the gold head of 						that cane, causing the carriage to slow, and glanced toward him.I am 						trusting your word in this, Tremayne.Respectable men take on mistresses all 						the time, but they dont bloody marry them.Is that understood?That will change.Yes, Your Grace.Roderick reached out and swung 						down on the latch, flinging open the carriage door.Without waiting for the 						carriage to come to a complete halt, he jumped out into the pelting, 						whipping rain, bracing himself against the still moving road beneath him.He 						stumbled against the hard impact of the slippery mud beneath his boots, 						sliding against the thick mud.Regaining his balance, he turned 						around and squinted against the rain hazed street.In the distance, he could 						see Georgia had already turned and was walking in the opposite direction.As 						the rain came down harder, she gathered up her soaked skirts and sprinted 						away, kicking up a trail of mud and water.Georgia!Hundreds of icelike droplets poured down so rapidly 						he could hardly see as he pumped his arms and legs through the mucked mud 						squelching against every rapid movement.You there!the duke shouted 						out to one of the marshals.Follow him!Lest he altogether 					drown.Roderick sprinted onward toward 						Georgia, charging through puddles.Arctic spatters of water rose up time and 						time again, soaking his trousers and boots more and more.He gnashed his 						teeth as numbness slowly overtook his body.The hooves of a horse trembled 						the ground, following him, as Georgia disappeared around a corner where 						another mud street crossed.Georgia!Roderick dodged 						oncoming carts and carriages as people stepped out from beneath the eaves of 						buildings to watch him dash.He sucked in breath after breath, pumping his 						legs faster and faster until he turned the corner, momentarily sliding to 						make the turn.He spotted her disappearing 						through a narrow stone archway of a stone wall stretching almost the length 						of the street.Gigantic green leafed oak trees flourished on the other side 						of the old wall that hid a looming, abandoned church beyond.Georgia!he yelled above the 						rain.Glancing back toward the lone 						uniformed man on his horse, which was splashing torrents of mud, Robinson 						pointed the marshal toward the church and direction he was going, before 						dashing through the narrow stone archway where Georgia had 						disappeared.The rain vanished as a canopy of 						large branches sheltered him from the downpour.The rushing silence pulsed 						against his ears as a decrepit, perpendicular style church towered before 						him within the small courtyard.He swiped away the water from his face and 						glanced around, finding only quiet, crooked gravestones and mossy grounds 						bordered by stone walls.It was as if Georgia had never been.Georgia?He jogged through the 						old churchyard, scanning the empty courtyard.Occasional drops of rain 						dripped through the branches of the trees, the eerie silence making him 						wonder if these grounds had ever been touched by the living.A small ivy covered stone crypt, 						separate from the church, made him pause.The mildewed stone had markings 						that had faded against time and its black iron gate had been left wide 						open.He made his way through the open 						gate.Small mossy steps appeared, leading down into what appeared to be a 						small pool of water hidden deep within.He stepped down and into the 						shadowed darkness.Cool, stale air pushed up from the bottom, as if the 						crypt were breathing.Georgia?he called, his voice 						echoing around him.Robinson?a choked voice echoed back.Relief frilled his soaked body.Step by step, he made his way down toward her, the moist air growing heavier 						as rotting wood filled his nostrils.Shafts of gray light from the outside 						world illuminated the scaly, dark walls covered with dead ivy and 						moss.Georgias shadowed figure 						kneeled before him at the very last step that disappeared into what appeared 						to be murky water.She glanced up at him, a soft gray line of light exposing 						only the right half of her wet face.I didnt think Id see you 						again.He stepped toward her, tension 						and frustration knotting his muscles knowing that she thought so little of 						herself to not only have almost given up on them, but that she would also 						feel the need to lurk in the shadows of a crypt like some ghost.I am 						absolutely livid, Georgia, knowing that the moment you realized you 						were the pauper and I the king, you knelt upon broken glass even as I 						offered you the means to carry you over it.You will never kneel like that 						before me or anyone else again, allowing your dignity and all that matters 						to you to bleed.Do you understand me?Always be the woman I know you to be.Be the one who wishes to go west when everyone else is going south.For that 						is the only 						woman I could ever allow myself to love.Because I need a woman to do more 						than love me.I need a woman willing to fight for me even when I am unable 						to fight for myself.She lowered her gaze and half 						nodded, but said nothing.He swallowed, trying to calm 						himself.My real name is Viscount Roderick Gideon Tremayne, though I also 						appear to go by yet another name.Yardley.I wanted you to know that.For 						maybe now you will have me.She glanced up.In truth, he went on, I much 						prefer being Robinson.For he, at least, was a good man.One I relate to.He let out a shaky breath and stepped closer until he was at her side.He 						crouched alongside her.What are you doing in here?Tis 					morbid.She touched a finger to the 						water at her feet.I always come here.He glanced toward her but could 						barely see the soft, hazy outline of her face.Why?Its been my sanctuary for 						years, she admitted, her voice drifting and echoing around them.When Da 						was still alive, he told me every time we passed this way, that the water 						sittin in this crypt could foretell the future if one had the patience to 						stare at its reflection long enough.Daft though it may be, Ive been 						starin at the water since.Roderick gazed down at the water 						below their feet, seeing only the blurred, darkened outline of their 						figures.Has it ever foretold anything of worth?A harsh laugh escaped her.Yes.It would seem my future is bleak and undefined as the water 					itself.Roderick leaned toward her and 						cupped a hand beneath her warm chin, turning her shadowed face to him with 						chilled fingertips.She lifted her gaze to his and he felt himself melting 						away.Your future is so much brighter than you think.He released her chin 						and gestured toward the water.I ask that you tell me what you 					see.She paused.I dont see a 						thing.Yes, you do, he insisted, 						pointing at the water before her.No matter how distorted or shadowed the 						reflection may be, I ask that you look and tell me what you see.She paused, shifting against the 						wall of the crypt.I see the dark outline of my face.Exactly.He rose to his feet.You are your own future, Georgia, which is probably what your father was 						trying to say.Because no one can foretell it in the way you can.Sometimes, 						we become victims of misfortune and the mistakes we bring upon ourselves, 						but even then, we have the right to fight for what will be.Why do you 						think I am standing here before you?Because you willed it and because I 						willed it.We made our future by chasing it when it mattered 						most.He continued to watch the fuzzy, 						darkened outline of her face.I will admit that whilst I stand here and 						lecture you, I bear my own burdens I have yet to comprehend and face.He 						swallowed.If I were to tell you that in my former life I was a bastard of 						the worst sort, would you still embrace me for what you now know me to 						be?She stared at him.Whatever did 						your father tell you?Or did youremember it on your own?My father told me and I sense 						it all to be true.I am unmarried, which is a blessing, to be sure, but it 						would seem I was romantically involved with my brothers wife.I am no more, 						but I was.Georgia rose to her feet and 						turned toward him.The shaft of gray light from the outside world 						illuminated the other half he had not earlier seen.The Robinson I know 						would have never done such a thing.His throat tightened.I 						know.She sighed, glancing away.What 						fools you and I make.You, who seeks to remember a past that is best 						forgotten, and I, who seek to create a lofty future that is as ridiculous as 						I.  We ought to both be hanged.Roderick stepped back, sensing 						she was already pulling away from him due to what he had so honestly 						confided.I would understand if you no longer wish to associate with 						me.She was quiet for a moment and 						met his gaze.What do you really want for us, Robinson?Be 					honest.He stepped toward her.In ten 						days, I leave for England.Come with me.I want you to share in everything I 						have for the rest of our lives whilst we learn to love each other more.That 						is what I want.Say you will go with me.She gawked at him.You want me 						to go to England?Yes.To London, in particular.That is where my former life appears to be.London?She feigned a laugh.Twould be like throwin a 						wee Irish pebble out into vast Brit water and watchin it sink on impact.Im not exactly what you would call respectable society.Even I know that.Arent most Brits Protestant?Im bloody Catholic.Emphasis on the 						bloody.Does it matter?You will learn 						to become one of us and earn their respect.Just as you learned how to read 						and write despite barely holding up a quill.And what if I disappoint you?What if I cant learn to be anythin more than what I already 					am?The ache within his chest only 						seemed to grow with his need for her.You could never disappoint me, 						Georgia.Wealth is meaningless if its holder has no integrity.And you have 						enough integrity to fill not only my heart but an entire 					kingdom.She searched his face, her 						features softening.Do you mean that?I do, and only hope that my 						former life doesnt disillusion you or hurt you because I have no idea what 						awaits us in England.None.As long as you continue to be 						the man standin before me, Ill stand beside you.He stared at her in disbelief.You will come?Regardless of whatever my past holds?She nodded.Yes.He swallowed.I 					Why?Because I have faith youll not 						disappoint me or yourself.I have faith youve already learned how to be a 						better man but have yet to see it yourself.He softened his voice, honored 						to no end that he had somehow earned the love of such an incredible woman.I vow that you will never regret having faith in me.She eyed him and intoned 						half seriously, Theyd better have apple trees in London, Robinson.Or you 						and I are finished.You got that?A gruff laugh escaped him.I 						will have them shipped in and planted in the front yard the moment we arrive 						to ensure we last.He held out his hand.Come.Let us not stand here in 						the shadows of a crypt.She hesitated and slid her cool 						fingers into his own.Whatever shall I call you?Roderick?No.Call me Robinson.For I am 						he at heart.He tightened his hold on that hand and led her up the small 						stone steps of the crypt and out past the gate leading them back into the 						churchyard.Georgia.There is something else you must know.Something that 						will complicate our lives.She glanced toward him, her 						bundled wet hair hanging adorably lopsided.What?He fingered her small, calloused 						hand, thankful she would never touch another pail again.Though I am 						wealthy, I cannot sever my fathers favor, for in doing so, I would be 						sending us both into poverty.As such, we cannot marry until I am able to 						prove your worth to my father.Is that something you can accept given that 						we might not be able to marry for what may be months?Or 					evenyears?She enthusiastically shook his 						hand.Dont you worry.Ill prove my worth.However long it takes.She 						poked at him.But youll have to teach me how to be a lady, in 						turn.You are a lady.She rolled her eyes.Dont you 						be givin me that.I know what I am, and if were goin to impress your 						father, were goin to have to work piss hard.He laughed.I suggest we start 						by having you use more respectable language.If you think I offend easily, 						the duke offends worse.He brought her hand up to his lips, kissing her 						hand.Now come.My father awaits.She paused, bringing them both 						to a halt and gesturing toward her soaked gown and muddied bare feet.I 						cant meet him like this.He scanned her gown, which clung 						almost indecently to the curves of her small breasts.I rather like what 						youre wearing.She smacked his shoulder.For 						all the wrong reasons, you rake.Right you are.He grinned, 						tugging her by the hand toward the entrance where one of the marshals still 						stood waiting.He called out to the man, Inform His Grace that I will be 						escorting Mrs.Milton back to her tenement, so she might properly dress 						before our departure.The man inclined his head and 						disappeared into the rushing rain beyond the wall.Roderick tugged her forward.Come.Patience is not a virtue of this man who is apparently my father.Whilst you put on a new dress, I will stall for time and poke about his 						character to better understand what we are up against.She drew them both to a halt.Ill have to do more than pull on a dress.I have to wash my feet and 						pack.Pack?Yes.I have all of my pots, 						cups, plates, linens and such.Im also not about to leave my box in the 						wall for the next person to find.Theres a good ninety eight dollars and 						ninety six cents we can make use of.Not to mention all of the gold coins 						your father gave me.Were goin to need it.Roderick drew closer, bringing 						her cool, callus roughened hand up to his lips again.He kissed it several 						times, allowing the warmth of his lips to seep into that skin, and said 						mockingly, I am heir to a dukedom, my dear.Do you know what that means?Or 						do you need me to expound it?She scrunched her nose.It 						means I dont need to pack.Is that what that means?Exactly.Only pack your 						clothes, as there wont be time to properly clothe you until we get to 						London.Leave everything else of worth to Matthew.Especially the money.He 						could use it.She gasped.Im not leavin 						that bastard my money.Roderick leaned toward her.Georgia.Just imagine what one hundred and ninety eight dollars and 						ninety six cents will buy us, given how much Matthew has done for us for a 						mere four and forty dollars, what with him running around to banks, letting 						me grope his stepmother and even giving me clothes?She gawked up at him.Hed bend 						over for all of England wearin a smile, is what.He grinned.Exactly.And the 						more friends you and I have supporting our union, the more likely everything 						will fall into place.The only thing that stops God from 						sending forth a second Flood is that the first 						one was useless.Nicolas Chamfort,Caractres et anecdotes 						(1771) DRESSED IN HER BEST SUNDAY gown, which shed stitched 						herself with great pride, Georgia pushed out a breath and glanced around her 						tenement one last time, lingering in the small kitchen of what used to be 						her life.Smoothing her still damp hair, which shed assembled into a coif 						she hoped looked respectable, she wandered over to the small wood table and 						emptied the contents of her box upon it for Matthew to find.Leaving the box open, she 						hurried to the wall and reached up and over the doorless cupboard for her 						mothers rosary, lifting the wooden beads off the nail.She kissed them, 						thanking the Lord in heaven for all of her blessings, and let the beads fold 						down and into a pile at the bottom of the box before pressing the wood lid 						back into place.Aside from all of her gowns, 						which shed bundled up in a large sack, her fathers box and her mothers 						rosary were the only things she cared to keep of the life she was leaving 						behind.One day, when her own children were old enough for stories, she 						would show them the roots of her past and take pride in it for what it was.Tucking the box into the wool sack, she knotted the material into itself to 						hold it closed.She slid the brass key off the 						table, grabbed up her sack and opened the door, stepping outside.After 						turning the key in the lock, she pulled it out and sighed.No more worrying 						about counting pennies.Imagine that.She lingered before the door, 						touching the well worn wood panel one last time with the hand holding her 						key and hoped that the path she had chosen for herself would be everything 						she had dreamed of and more.Youre leaving, arent 						you?She jumped and whirled toward 						John, who lingered in the open door of his own tenement.His darkened blond 						hair was matted against his forehead from the rain he had yet to dry from.His shirt and trousers were still as wet as the rest of him.She drifted over to his side of 						the door, bringing her sack against her hip, and paused before him.Who 						needs the west when I found all four corners of the world in one 						man?He folded his arms over his 						chest, lowering his gaze.Im sorry about yesterday.I swallowed too much 						whiskey.She sighed.Id rather we not 						even talk about it.Im on my way out.I need to drop off this here key to 						one of the neighbors and leave instructions for Matthew.John held out his hand.Ill do 						it for you.She rolled her eyes.Im not 						givin it to you.Hell get it.She pointed at him with the key.Do you promise to deliver this with the right instructions?Aye.He set his hand against 						his chest.Upon me mums grave and soul.That I swear.Knowing his mother had once 						meant everything to him, Georgia sighed and held out the key.Tell Matthew 						to cancel the room, unless he wants the cheaper lease, and inform him that 						everythin I left behind is his to do with as he pleases.He also needs to 						gather the laundry from the front room, and take it over to the priests over 						on Barclay, Mott, Sheriff and Ann lest they arrest us all for stealin their 						shirts and trousers.She drew in a breath and let it 						out.Tell him that although Ill miss him in a morbid sort of way, that 						Ill not write, because Im goin into respectable society and cant be 						associatin with thieves.He knows Ive always felt that way, even prior to 						Robinson, so it shouldnt surprise him.John hesitated, reached out and 						slid the key from her hand.Ill tell him.He shifted closer toward her 						and lingered, the scent of rain and must clinging to his skin and clothes.Take care of yourself.Oh, I will.She stepped back, 						cradling her sack up and against her chest.One last thing.It involves 						you.He quirked a blond brow.What?Remember my good friend Agnes 						Meehan?The one with the bright blue eyes that always lingered about your 						mothers door a few years back?His grin faded.What about 						her?She still isnt married, 						despite her fathers grumblings.I know you once had a hot eye for her 						before she moved west.Get the address from her cousin and buy yourself a 						stagecoach ticket.I doubt she even remembers 						me.I bet you she does.In the last 						letter, she asked about whether or not you were still lookin to 						marry.He glanced up, eyeing her.When 						was her last letter?She bit back a smile.A month 						ago.She leaned toward him and poked his chest.Just stay away from the 						whiskey and razors thinkin itll impress her.Because it wont.He reached out his other hand 						and skimmed her arm, his features twisting.Im sorry, Georgia.I didnt 						mean to make a mess of things.I just Grabbing her, he yanked her hard 						against himself, awkwardly squelching the sack between them.He buried his 						wet head into the curve of her shoulder.She stiffened but realized the 						poor man was only looking for comfort.She wrapped an arm around him, 						adjusting the sack between them, and patted his back with her free hand, her 						fingers sticking to his wet linen shirt.There, there.I forgive you.So go 						on and forgive yourself.He nodded against her shoulder, 						tightening his hold.Footfalls bounded up the stairs 						and paused on the landing somewhere off to the side.Sensing it was Robinson, she 						stepped outside the embrace and pointed at John one last time.Write Agnes.Dont sit about Orange Street waitin for somethin better to come along, 						because it wont.We Irish have to align our own stars given that everyone 						else seems to think they own the goddamn sky.Right you are in that.He 						nudged his shaven chin out in the direction beyond her.I suggest you 						leave.Your Brit is waiting.John held up the key, assuring her Matthew 						would get it, and put up a hand in farewell, before quietly disappearing 						into his tenement.Lowering his gaze, he shut the door.Georgia lingered, hoping John 						would someday know happiness.With a sigh, she swiveled toward the direction 						of the stairs and hurried toward Robinson with her sack.We can 					go.Robinson met her gaze.You 						cannot be holding men like that anymore, Georgia.Her brows rose.She jerked to a 						halt and thumbed toward Johns direction.I barely kicked that one to the 						pavement.Dont you be next.He glanced away, adjusting the 						wet linen shirt that clung to his wide chest.This isnt about jealousy.In 						my circle, from what little I do remember, men and women do not touch each 						other like that unless they are married.And even when they are married, 						such things are only done in the confines and privacy of their home.I just 						dont want my father to judge you.Her heart sank knowing that most 						likely his father might never accept them.But at least they would be together 						and in each others arms every day and every night.I 					understand.Good.He cleared his throat.I actually came up here to clarify some etiquette before I formally 						introduce you to my father.When you and I are alone, you may freely call me 						Robinson, but in the presence of others, especially my father, you must 						refer to me as my lord or Lord Tremayne.It is a sign of respect.Will 						you be able to remember that?Of course.You are Robinson 						when we are alone and my lord or Lord Tremayne when we are 					not.Very good.Whenever you speak 						to my father, regardless of whether you and he are alone or in the presence 						of a thousand, always refer to him as Your Grace.She blinked.As in the 						grace of 						God?Yes.Isnt that a bit 						sacrilegious?He let out a laugh.I suppose 						it is.Tis something we will both have to swallow.The man is staunch and 						therefore youll need to play into his idea of respectability when in his 						presence.You mean you want me to act 						like this?Thrusting out her chin, she stiffly held out both hands before 						her, ensuring her sack didnt fall from her hand, and wobbled about for him 						from side to side.He leveled her with a stare.Are you being serious?She laughed, hitting his arm 						with her free hand.I was tuggin your rope.I know exactly what you 						mean.He laughed and dabbed her nose 						with a cold finger.I want you to spend as much time with my father as 						possible.That way, he will get to know you for the queen that you are.Make 						your time with him count.Do you think you can impress him with intelligent 						conversation devoid of all things crass?Of course I can.Ive seen 						plenty of upper circle women converse with upper circle gentlemen over on 						Broadway.Watch.Georgia regally set her chin, softened her lips and kept 						her features calm and poised.Demurely meeting his gaze, she intoned in her 						best prim and most civilized voice, I do believe I shall faint from 						displeasure knowin this foul weather is goin to ruin not only my lace 						parasol but my bonnet.Robinson boomed with laughter, 						his features twisting in merriment.He staggered backward, bumping against 						the wall behind him, before falling forward again.He laughed and laughed 						and laughed until there were actually tears emerging from the corners of his 						eyes.She blinked.By Joseph, shed 						never seen him laugh so hard and couldnt help but feel offended knowing 						that her best attempt at being civilized was being mocked.Did I do it 						wrong?Still laughing, he waved toward 						her face with a forefinger as if attempting to rearrange her features and 						choked out, That wasnt exactly what I callintelligent 						conversation.It wasnt that bad.Oh, yes, it was.
