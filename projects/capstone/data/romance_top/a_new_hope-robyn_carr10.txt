She was busy.She made her own life, but George stayed on the farm.I wasnt sure I could do what Lori did Loris so smart and independent and no one ever rolled their eyes at her.She wiped her cheeks.But I loved you.So much.He smiled sympathetically.He was guilty as charged.He had ignored her complaints and hoped shed get over them.Hed married a prissy model and his mother had thought hed lost his mind.He kept bringing her back to the farm even though she didnt like the landscape, the people or the food.The truth washe didnt want to go dancing.He didnt give a shit about brunch at the Monaco and thought modeling was shallow and a waste of time.Im sorry, he said.I think I wasnt a very good husband.But...did you ever love me?she asked.Oh ho, he said, laughing.I loved you like a freight train!You knocked me out.And I didnt want you to be any different, either.I wanted you to be just exactly the way you are.But I think youre right about memy expectations were unfair.You couldnt be the way you are with me or with my family.Im sorry.I thought I was ready to be a good husband.And maybe you thought so, too.Are you ready now?she asked.Because if youre ready now...Natalie, we made a mistake.We had some good chemistry but that was the beginning and end of it.Everything else we faced as a couple?We couldnt handle it.We were too different.Well always be too different.But now that we know...Now that we know, we have a chance to be smarter the next time around, but Im afraid not with each other.Im in love with someone else now.He gestured over his shoulder.See this RV?I think were going to live in it while I build a house right over there.An RV, just like all those gypsies in the Lacoumette family.He shook his head.You dont want me or my life.And, for what its worth, I still think youre the most beautiful girl in the world.But that wont make it work.What about her?she asked.Isnt she beautiful?Shes beautiful, he said.Beautiful inside and out.You have nothing in common with her, though.Im not going to keep marrying beautiful women until I find one who does things my way.This woman Im going to marryshe loves me and my life.He wiped a tear from her cheek.Im sorry, Natalie.It wasnt all your fault it didnt work.You picked the wrong guy.I loved you, she said with a hiccup.I loved you.We have to move on.Youre going to find the right guy.He grinned at her.And have brunch at the Monaco every Sunday!I cant move on until you forgive me.I didnt do it to hurt you, I swear to God.I did it to save myself.Despite all his effort, he felt that ache in his throat that signaled the threat of choking sobs.I know, he said in a breath.Please tell me you understand.I think I do, he said.And then he borrowed Gingers words.I think I see how I was complicit.I do forgive you.Can you forgive me?I guess I wasnt easy.Oh, yes, I forgive you, of course.She wiped at her eyes.If we could run away somewhere, away from farms and modeling jobs and everything, we could be happy, I know we could.He shook his head.Nah, it wouldnt work.Neither one of us should try to be someone else.I guess thats right, she said.Will we be friends?she asked.He smiled.What would we do as friends, Natalie?Maybe go out dancing some night?He shook his head.Tell you what, kiddo.Ill be in the biology department now and then.If the coffeepot is on, well visit for a few minutes.Catch up.But you dont have to invite me to your wedding.Because youre not inviting me to yours, she said.It was not a question.I dont think were inviting anyone, he said with a laugh.Weve both had first marriages that didnt work very well.Itll be small and efficient.Then, with luck and experience, well work on what it means to be partners.But you?Youll be fine.Youll find the kind of guy exactly right for the kind of girl you are.So you really forgive me?Sure.Yes.Doesnt mean Im not sad about it, but I share responsibility.We married the wrong people, Natalie.Okay, she said.Okay.At least youre not threatening to call the police or anything.He laughed at her.I was still mad.Im not mad anymore.She put a hand on his chest.I wish we had a second chance, she whispered.She really was a sweet girl.So pretty.He kissed her forehead.No, you dont.Go on now.Start over.You deserve something that really works for you.She smiled.She stood and walked away alone.Matt sat in the canvas chair for a long time.He heard her car start.A minute or two later he saw her white BMW turn at the road.He sat another minute.Then he folded the canvas chairs, attached them to the storage device that slid neatly under the RV and went inside.He hoped Ginger would like this RV.The living room was comfortable with a soft leather sectional and recliner.The kitchen was compact but completely functional, the bathroom large, the master bedroom with queen size bed was spacious.This one had a deep closet rather than narrow wall units.He wanted her to be okay with this, he really did.But if she didnt love it he would find whatever it took because this time he was going to listen.He sat down on the sofa and leaned back.They never would have made it, he and Natalie.Now, a couple of years later and a little wiser, he wondered how he ever thought they could.After all this time blaming Natalie, he wondered if the whole thing had been his fault.But there had been a child.Maybe it had been a little girl with Natalies puffy, pouty lips and large eyes who would beg him to read one more story.Or a son who would ride on his shoulders and try to smuggle newborn lambs out of the lambing pens.A child of his own, a child whod love him no matter how narrow minded or difficult he was, just the way he loved Paco.He felt the tears well up.Then he felt the waterworks turn on, a gulley washer, flowing down his cheeks.His nose followed suit and he wiped a shirtsleeve across it several times.All illusions about his relationship with Natalie were gone.But thered been a baby.A child of his own.And for the first time since it had happened, Matt grieved.A New Hope        Twenty It was mid August, school was starting in a couple of weeks and the night air had already chilled in Thunder Point.The flower shop was cool and Ginger wore a sweater.Grace had gone with Troy for some lunch.Soon Troy would be teaching again and his days would be spent at the high school.Her cell phone rang.She looked at the display and saw it was Matt.She smiled broadly as she answered.Well now, I hardly ever hear from you at this time of day!I wanted to hear your voice, he said.I wanted to thank you for being the wonderful, thoughtful, sensitive woman you are.Thank you, sweetheart.Are you coming down with a cold?No, just a little sinus thing, I guess.Ginger, you were right.I had a conversation with Natalie.She heard I was getting married and she came to the farm.I. ..uh...made sure she would hear the news.I phoned the head of the biology department and told him I was getting married.I thought it might get her attention.Ginger was quiet for a moment.And?Is she all right?Are you?I made some terrible mistakes, I think.I know I did.I thought the life I chose for myself should have nothing to do with her.I never really listened to her.I treated her like a malcontent.A bitchy wife.It was like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.She was driven to such desperate measures.Oh, Matt...I was so busy being angry I never tried to understand what really went wrong.I swear to God, I wont let that happen to us, Ginger.You must be devastated, she said.She wanted another chance.Can you even imagine what a mistake that would be?I know, she said softly.And she did know.It had been the same with Mick.If she had never wanted a traditional marriage and family, they could have been happy together for a long time.Of course, Mick needed someone who could be happy helping him achieve success in the music industry and there werent many women out there who could sacrifice all their own desires for someone elses.How was that any different from women who married doctors or businessmen who single mindedly concentrated on their own success and ignored their families?I guess no one needs a marriage that leaves them lonely.Lonely and disappointed, Matt said.No matter how many times she told me she just couldnt be happy married to a farm, I didnt listen to her.Farmer, Ginger said.You mean, married to a farmer.No, I meant farm.She needed my commitment and attention.I gave it to the farm instead.And then...and then there was a child who was lost.His voice became thick again.I think I would have liked being a father.It wasnt some sinus thing, she realized.He was crying.Grieving.He tried to mask it but the revelation had taken an emotional toll.He regretted his mistakes in the marriage but he grieved the loss of his child.If she knew anything about Matt, and she thought she knew him pretty well, he hadnt allowed himself to grieve before now.You will be a father, she said.Youll be a wonderful father.I think you knew a few things I never would have guessed, he said.I needed to face that loss.I was doing it alone and it just wasnt working.Ive never told anyone but you about that loss.I thought it just pissed me off.I didnt know how deep it cut, he said softly.His voice cracked.Where are you, Matt?she asked.Oh, Im alone.Of course.Hiding out in the little place I rented for us.Trying to get my shit together before anyone catches on that underneath it all, Im just a regular human being.She let out a little laugh but there were tears on her cheeks.A very remarkable human being, she said.That must have been so hard to do.I love you.I wish you were here, he said.Id hold on to you.Youre the ballast in my life.Did you tell her she was forgiven?Ginger asked.Yes, and I meant it.And I said I was sorry.And I meant that, too, because my God, what if I drove her to it?And just like you said would happen, I feel a little bit lighter.That was a load I didnt need.And it opened the door to his grief, which was real and powerful, she thought.Holding that back must have been so tiring.Another heavy load that he didnt need.Natalie probably did the best she could, Matt said.Im not sure I did my best but well never know...Matt, we all do the best we can at the time.I know youyouve never in your life set out to do your worst.Well, you might be wrong about that, he said.When I found out about the abortion I didnt want anything but to punish her.I didnt listen to her, comfort her, try to understand her or forgive her.I wanted to crush her.And now youve both made amends, Ginger said.You were kind.You can let go of her and the anger now.Whenever youre ready.Did you, Ginger?Let go of the anger with Mick?Sure, she said.Then she gave a little laugh.Mick is such a comical, one dimensional character that complete annoyance with his shallowness hangs on, but mostly I feel sorry for him.Hes missing out on a lot.Were not going to do thatmiss a lot, he said.I think we have an excellent shot at being ridiculously happy.I think youre right.I miss you.Ill be there Saturday.I might even drive up tomorrow night after the shop closes, if thats all right.Damn harvest, he muttered.If it werent for that, Id take a leave of absence.He sighed.Im going to stick my head under the hose, shake this off and go check my pears.She laughed.Call me later.We can whisper in each others ears until we fall asleep.When they disconnected and she had slipped the phone in her pocket, she put her head down on the worktable and cried.Matt was such a big, strong mans man it was heartbreaking to think of him crying over the loss of his baby.But it took a big man to admit to real emotions.She wanted to hold him, rock him in her arms, cover his bristly cheeks with kisses, close his eyes and hold him safe against her breast.Her tears came from the knowledge that they could move on now.Theyd really dealt with the past and could forge a future cast in love, trust and hope.Hey, hey, hey, Grace said, coming into the workroom.Troy stood behind her.Ginger lifted her head.How did you get in without ringing the bell?I think it tinkled, Ginger, Grace said.Youre crying your little eyes out!Whats the matter?Oh, dear.Listen, may I have a few minutes to collect myself?Then I can tell you all about it.Its not bad, really.I just need...Sure, Grace said.Ill be right here.Ginger made an attempt at a smile and fled up the back stairs to that little loft shed come to love.She washed her face, patted it dry and went back into the tiny living room.Where she nearly ran into Grace.You should lock the door if you want to be alone, Grace said.Oh, man, what are you doing?Butting in, Grace said.Look, sometimes we need to cry alone, sometimes we need a good friend to bear witness.Can you talk about it?Ginger sank onto the sofa.Its really not as dramatic as it looks.I somehow convinced Matt he had to make peace with his ex wife before we could move on together.It was a little more emotional for him than he expected but he told me hes glad he did it.In fact, he thanked me for pushing him to do that.She shook her head.Grace, he was so angry and from what Peyton has told me, Matts not like that.And I know, having been divorced after a short and unhappy marriage, how feeling like a failure can just piss you off.I wanted Matt to be free of that before we try to make our way together.I just miss him.And God, how lovely for him to say he feels so much better and it was thanks to me.Thats all.I got a little sentimental and weepy.She gave a helpless shrug.Ive never been with a man who said I made his life better.Grace smiled.Im with one.Its very nice.I know.Troy is perfect for you.Hes wonderful.Why are you here?Grace asked.Here?Ginger repeated.I just thought Id wash my face and No, Ginger.Here in Thunder Point.Pack a bag.Drive north.She looked at her watch.Youll get there before dinner.You can watch the sunset together tonight.You can hold on to each other and talk about the new life youll have together.Starting now.Grace, I cant leave you, she said.I promised!Youre pregnant and your mother is sick!Grace laughed.Oh, Im going to have to replace you so I hope it works out for you on Matts big old farm because if it doesnt, I might not have a job for you!She pulled Gingers hands into hers.Listen, my friend, you stepped into my shop and made it possible for me to finish building a house, get my mother transplanted, get her fixed up with a nurse she adores, helped me get married and move!I even made a trip to San Francisco to do a little work on managing that cumbersome estate while you held down the fort for me and even though you were paid a little, you did it all out of the generosity of that great big heart of yours.Now, dont waste any more time.Pack a bag.Quickly.You can come back next week to get the rest of your things.How can I leave you that fast?she whispered.What if you need me?Grace laughed.First of all, I have Iris and Troy for a while longer before school starts.I have a delivery boy and hes great.I have Waylan, Al, even Seth sometimes helps me cart my stuff inside, though I dont need themIm completely capable.Besides, from the second I first saw you with Matt I knew I wasnt going to be able to keep you.Now, are you going to argue with me or are you going to run to him?Run to him so you can wrap him in your arms and tell him how much you love him and how proud you are of him?Fresh tears wet her cheeks.Im so proud of him, she whispered.Its a brand new life, Ginger.Youve waited long enough.Dont waste another minute.* * * Matt turned on the faucet in the deep sink behind the house, the sink used to wash the mud off vegetables from his mothers garden.He stuck his head under the cold water.He squeezed liquid detergent right onto his head, his curling black hair, and plunged his hands into the lather.He watched the brown dirt flow down the drain with the soap and water.It wasnt a proper shampoo but it would be good enough for now.He lifted his head and shook off the water like a dog would, then he took the bar of soap and the brush and began scrubbing his filthy hands while water from his head dripped on his shirt, leaving his collar wet.He rinsed his hands, scrubbed, rinsed, scrubbed, rinsed and finally turned off the faucet and grabbed the towel.He wiped it down his face and left it streaked with dirt.Drying his hands, he turned.And he saw her again.Hed been seeing her all day.In exactly those clothes, toothat long, lace skirt, denim jacket and brown boots.Hed finally decided he at least had superior hallucinations when the breeze caught her skirt and lifted it.Some of her soft honey blond hair blew across her face and she raised a hand to push it back over her ear.God!She was real!He threw down the towel and ran to her.She opened her arms and for just a split second he thought, If Im dying its all right because this is the way I choose to go.Before he could complete the thought, he filled his arms with her.His lips were buried in the soft fragrance of her neck.Sweetheart, he said in a breath, holding on for dear life.It took a moment for him to think straight.He should talk to her.Instead, he covered her mouth in a steamy and deep kiss, squeezing her so hard he hoped he wouldnt break her in two.It was the sound of her soft laughter that made him finally let go of her lips.You made me all wet, she said.Fancy bath you have there.What are you doing here?he asked, breathless.I needed you, she said.You needed me.He pushed a little hair out of her eyes.When do you have to go back?I dont have to.Well, yes, I do.I left some things behind and I havent said a proper goodbye to Ray Anne or my friends, but theres no hurry.Next week, maybe.For one night.Or maybe Ill do it in one day.What about Grace?he asked.She said shes going to have to replace me.She ran her fingertips through his black, curling hair.She said the second she saw us together she knew shed have to replace me.She told me to stop wasting time.Cradling her head in one big hand, he gave her a tender kiss.Ive always admired Grace.Have I mentioned that?Actually, no, she said, laughing.I hope Im not imposing.He grinned.Come with me, he said.He led her around the back of the house to the RV.I saw that from the road.Has the family started to arrive already?I thought I had time before He cut her off by lifting her into his arms.Your castle, my love.If you approve of it, we can get one of our own and live in it while we build.Its yours?Ours.Its rented but if it works for you, Ill buy one.He grinned devilishly.I could come home for lunch.Ive always been impressed by how enterprising you are.He turned her so he could open the door to the RV and then they both laughed.It wasnt big enough for him to carry her over the threshold and inside without doing some damage.He put her down carefully.Oh!Matt!You did this all by yourself?What do you think?I think its wonderful, she said.It might be bigger than that little loft.Theyre getting very fancy, he said.It has a two person shower and a whirlpool tub.What a wonderful idea, I would have never He grabbed her hand and pulled her into his arms again.Thank you for making me face the ghosts.I wouldve fought the past forever and damn, it feels so much better to realize that I can leave some things behind and look at the future with you.I dont know how you know these things...I was only guessing, she said.But I wanted you so much and I knew I couldnt have you until you were free.Were ready now, honey.We have to be ready now because Im so in love with you, Im starting to hallucinate.You did have a dazed look for a second.Will your parents approve of you living in sin right on their property?I dont know.I dont care.But for your information, were not going to live in sin for long.At the first opportunity well get married.I need you to be my wife.Youre already my heart and my breath.Tell me youll marry me, that well belong to each other.I think we already do belong to each other, Matt.The rest is a formality.A very sweet formality.* * * George Lacoumette stood just outside the barn, watching the back of the house where the vegetable sink was.As Paco came out, George put out an arm, blocking him.They stood together, George leaning on a shovel handle and Paco wiping his brow with a kerchief.They watched as Matt rinsed his head, scrubbed his hands and then spotted his girl.They observed as he kissed her brainless, then lifted her into his arms to carry her to that fancy new RV hed parked at the side of the house.After a little more kissing and whispering, they disappeared inside.I dont think Matts coming to dinner, George said.Just as well, Paco said.We should maybe leave a little nourishment on the step for them.Theyd have to open the door to find it, George said.Lets wash up, Paco said.Now that the coast is clear.Ginger is a nice girl, George said.She makes a lot more sense for him.Well get a lot more work out of him now, Paco said.Married men are more reliable.You sure hes going to marry her?George asked.Didnt you see?Paco asked.He might marry her before dinner!* * * * * Keep reading for an

after Christmas.She had no orders to fill, no deliveries to make, and shed be very surprised if her shop phone rang at all.Most people were trying to recover from Christmas; many families were away for the holidays or had company to entertain.Grace drove to North Bend to grab an early skate before the rink got busy.Figure skating classes were suspended over Christmas break and people, mostly kids who wanted to try out their new skates, would dominate the rink later in the day.Grace loved these secret early morning skates.She had a deal with Jake Galbraith, the rink owner.She could call him and if it was convenient, hed let her skate for an hour or two while they were getting ready to open.He didnt want to charge her, but she paid him fifty dollars an hour anyway.It was a point of pride.He smiled at her when she came in and told her to have a good skate.She stretched and then stepped onto the deserted ice, closely following the Zamboni ice resurfacer that had just finished.She warmed up with forward and backward crossovers, backward half swizzle pumps, figure eights, scratch spins and axels.She noticed Jake was watching, leaning his forearms on the boards.She performed a forward spiral and a leaning tower spiral.She executed a perfect sit spin next.She circled the ice a few times, adding a jump here and there.She had been famous for her straddle split jump, touching her toes with her fingers.When she looked for Jake again, he had disappeared.Suddenly, the music started, filling the rink with the strains of Rhapsody in Blue.She glided into an arabesque, arms stretched, fingers pointed, wrists flexible.She saw that Jake had returned, was watching her every move.She went for a double axel and fell on her ass.She got up, laughing to herself.She glided around the rink a few times, tried the jump again and landed it, but it wasnt pretty.The music changed to another Gershwin tune.Shed practiced to this music as a little girl; it was familiar and comfortable.Her earliest memories of skating always filled her with nostalgia and comfort.That was before the competition got really fierce.Shed been on the ice for an hour when the music segued into Alicia Keyss Girl on Fire and it lit her up.Her signature music.She was on fire!She skated like she was competing.When she was fifteen, stronger but lighter and more flexible, she could really catch the air.She noticed other people watchinga guy leaned on his broom and gazed at her, a couple of teenage girls who worked in the skate rental shop had stopped working to watch, the Zamboni driver leaned a shoulder against the rink glass, hands in his pockets.Two hours slid by effortlessly.She slowed and got off the ice when she heard the sounds of people arriving to skate.Beautiful, Jake said.Its been a while since Ive seen you.Holidays are busy at the shop, she said.She tried to get to the rink on Sunday mornings, but the past month had been franticwreaths, centerpieces, two weddings and increased day to day traffic in the shop.You should spend more time on the ice.I have a long list of people looking for a good coach.She shook her head.I dont think Id be a good coach.I dont have time for one thing.And Id never go back on the circuit, even with students.I left that world.I thought the day would come that you might be interested in going back, maybe not in competition for yourself, but coaching.I think on name alone youd make a fortune.I left the name behind, too, she reminded him with a smile.We have an agreement.I havent said a word.People ask me, who is that girl, but I just say youre training and asked not to be identified.Some of them guess and would show up to watch you if they had any idea when you would be skating.The ice misses you.Watching you skate is like seeing music.Nice try.I dont train anymore.I spent as much time on my ass as on my blades.I look like crap.Your worst is better than a lot of bests I see.Ive missed you.Maybe youll have more time in the new year.Well see.She took off her skates and pulled on her Ugg boots.Sometimes she questioned her decision to leave it all behind, because being on the ice made her so happy.Then shed remind herself that while a couple of hours felt great, the difficult routine of a competitive figure skater was grueling, exhausting.As a coach shed never be able to push young girls the way shed been pushed.She pulled out a hundred dollars in cash for her two hours alone on the rink.Jake had told her he put the money in a special scholarship fund for young wannabe Olympians who couldnt otherwise afford lessons.She told him however he wanted to spend it was fine with her.As long as he didnt sell her out.As she left the rink she reflected that her life in Thunder Point was so much more peaceful than it had been in competition and her freedom was hard won.She had friends now, even if they didnt know who she had been before.At least no one thought of her as tragic or complicated or as one of the saddest yet most triumphant stories told on the competitive skating circuit.No one was threatened by her, hated her, feared or resented her.No one called her a rich bitch or a dirty liar.Of course, the weight of her secrets sometimes wore on her.Jake Galbraith had recognized her at once.All she had to do was ask the cost of a private rink for a couple of hours and he knew immediately who she was.She hadnt confided in anyone in Thunder Point.When she got into the van she saw that she had a message on her cell phone.She listened to it before leaving the parking lot.It was Mikhail, her old coach.He still kept tabs on her.They stayed in touch.Often, they left each other a series of brief messages because he could be anywhere in the world.I am wishing you happy Christmas, the Russian said.I think I am day late.If so, you will understand.Grace waited until she was back in her tiny apartment above the flower shop before returning the call.I thought you had forgotten all about me, she said to his voice mail.It was a happy Christmas.I was a maid of honor for my friend Iris yesterdaythats how I spent the day.Ive never been in a wedding before.It was small and intimate, a beautiful experience.And this morning I went skating.I fell three times.Then she mimicked his accent.What can I say?I am clumsy oaf with no training.Then she laughed, wished him the best New Year ever and said goodbye.Graces beloved father and coach died rather suddenly when she was only fourteen and he was sixty.Her mother, once a competitive and professional figure skater, responded by hiring an even better coach, a very short Russian of huge reputation who could take Grace all the way.There was no time for grieving, they had work to do.Mikhail Petrov was a tough, brilliant coach and they were together for nine years.He had been very unhappy with her decision to leave competition and for a couple of years he pestered her to return to the sport.Before you forget everything I taught you!Her mother, Winnie Dillon Banks, who had herself been a teenage skating wonder, was worse than devastated.She was furious.If you quit now, after all Ive invested in you, you are dead to me.After the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Grace walked away from everything and everyone.All shed ever wished for was to be like everyone else.To not be constantly judged every time she took a breath.She wanted to be normal.* * * In the afternoon, when Grace was just about to ruin her dinner with a big bowl of popcorn while looking through various online floral arrangements on her laptop, there was a light tapping at her back door.She pulled the curtain to peek out through the window in the door and was shocked to see Iris.She opened the door.Dont newlyweds lay around in bed for several days after the wedding?Doing it until their parts give out?Grace asked, only half teasing.Maybe when one of the newlyweds isnt the town deputy, Iris said.We did eat breakfast in bed and Seth didnt go to the office until about one.I cleaned the house, thawed something for dinner and...She paused.I called Troy to tell him.You didnt tell him before, huh?Grace asked.Iris shook her head.Troy Headly, high school history teacher and the fantasy of all the high school girls, had had a very big crush on Iris.They had dated for only a few months last spring when Iris told him theirs would have to be a friendship only relationship.She was the high school guidance counselor and before getting involved with a teacher in the same school, she had to be powerfully sure.And she hadnt been.But Troy had pursued Iris right up until Seth was in the picture.Even then, it was pretty obvious he still had a serious thing for Iris and wouldnt mind if Seth fell off the face of the earth.Howd he take it?Grace asked.Like a man, Iris said.Is it too early for wine?Certainly not!Grace pulled a bottle of Napa Cellars sauvignon blanc from her little refrigerator and opened it.Was it awful?Nah, it was fine.Good, really.He was surprised we got married so soon, but then so was everyone.So were we, when you get down to it.He congratulated me and said he hoped Id be very happyall the right things.Then I asked him if he was going to be all right and he laughed, but he didnt sound amused.He said he was surprised to find himself disappointed an old girlfriend got married.Its hard for me to think of myself as his girlfriendit was never that serious.Even Troy admits hes not looking for a wife!Not now.He likes the single life.Grace poured the wine and put the bowl of popcorn between them.A gourmet treat, she said.Or maybe dinner.So, is it different?Being married?Not yet, Iris said.Ask me again when we merge bank accounts.Weve been solitary, single adults for a long time.Right now were each taking care of our own obligations until Seth either rents or sells his town house.Theres plenty of closet space at my house, but we could have issues when his manly furniture looks for space among my decidedly female things.Youre staying in your house, Grace said in relief.Its perfect for us.I like to ride my bike to work in good weather.I love your house, Grace said.Arent you ever going to have a honeymoon?Eventually.Were looking for deals online right now.Were going to sneak away in a couple of months, hopefully somewhere warm and sunny, when Seth can get away from the town and I can escape my office at school.But what about you, Grace?Why arent you seeing anyone?Grace burst out laughing.It wasnt the first time Iris had asked.First of all, who?Second, when?Dont you ever meet a groomsman at any of the weddings you do?Never.They all come long after Im gone and Im not invited to the receptions.Besides, isnt that the kiss of death?Hooking up with someone in the wedding party at the reception?No thanks.We have to get you out more, Iris said.Right, Grace said doubtfully.Maybe I could help you chaperone the prom and meet some very promising eighteen year old?Nah, I dont think so.Well go clubbing or something.Clubbing?Grace sputtered.In Thunder Point?Okay, well go up to North Bend.And graze.Im sure Seth would appreciate that!Well, I wont take any phone numbers or bring anyone home...Iris, Grace said, lifting her wineglass.Let it go.Ill handle my own love life.In my own time, in my own way.Theres always Troy, Iris said, sipping.Nah, were pals.Theres no chemistry.On his side.We had a beer together once, followed by grilled cheese and tomato soup.It was swell.Besides, Im not interested in your sloppy seconds.I read, you know.Rebound boyfriends are not a good idea.You cant just work all the time, Iris said.No?Grace asked.I thought you could.* * * Growing up, everyone thought Grace was a spoiled rich kid, but she had been raised on hard, committed, constant work.If she took a day off she felt ashamed.Her program would suffer.But her work hadnt been the kind average people understood.Her full name was Isabella Grace Dillon Banks.Shed given up most of her name and went by Grace Dillon because Izzy Banks was very well known in some circles.Probably not among her Thunder Point acquaintances, but for those who watched champion figure skating competitions around the world, Izzy Banks was known, both for her skating and for her involvement in dramas and scandals that rocked the skating world.Graces mother, Winnie Dillon Banks, was a wealthy heiress whose grandfather made money in tobacco.She was a well known skater in her time, though never as successful as Grace in competitions.Winnies best show as a competitive skater had been second place in Nationals.But she saw in her daughter her chance to win and became the ultimate stage mother.Grace had a privileged, isolated childhood where skating was everything.Grace was born to an ice skating icon and her coach.Winnie Dillon began a love affair with her coach, Leon Banks, when she was twenty two.Some cynical rivals and professional observers suggested she succumbed to marriage and motherhood when all signals pointed to her competing days being over.Winnie and Leon had their daughter on skates before she was four years old.They pushed and trained her hard.In those early days, when skating was simply fun, when she yearned to be the best, Grace was happy.She begged to skate and hated her time off.Shed have been on the ice eight hours a day if her father had let her.She was coddled and loved and indulged.She had a few friends, other little girls who were training and taking lessons and part of a skating club, some of them Leons other students.Grace loved her parents very much and didnt quite understand until after her fathers death that theirs had been a difficult marriage.Her father was much older than Winnie and more focused on his students than his wife.Her mother was a demanding diva and socialite; she dragged a reluctant Leon to charity events and parties.Her parents disagreed on almost everything, especially Graces training and education.Grace never went to traditional school, public or privateshe had tutors.Leon thought this might be a mistake, feared she wouldnt be a well adjusted child.At the age of twelve the level of competition turned serious.But Grace was winning everything in her age category and was quickly viewed as unbeatable.She trained on the ice several hours a day, took gymnastics, ballet and practiced yoga.The family moved from Atlanta to Chicago and finally settled in San Francisco, following the best opportunities for her training and education, as well as for Leons coaching prospects.Her father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer when Grace was fourteen.Winnie sought a tougher, stronger, more famous coach the moment Leon fell ill.It was almost as if shed chosen Mikhail before he was needed.Then Leon passed away rather swiftly, within months of his diagnosis.Winnie and Grace took a few days off, then it was back on the ice.Your success meant everything to your father, Winnie kept saying.It was true that Leon wanted the best for his daughter, but it was Winnie to whom winning was everything.No matter the personal cost.And skating became less for fun and more for life.Winnie blew a gasket whenever Grace didnt take first place.Grace left the world of competitive skating when she was twenty three, right after the Vancouver Games.She went to Portland to stay with a sweet older couple who had once worked for her mother.Ross and Mamie Jenkins had known Grace since birth.Theyd been part of Winnies staff, Ross a driver and Mamie in housekeeping.They had retired to open a flower shop a few years before Grace quit the circuit.When she needed them, they took her in.She collapsed.She was exhausted and depressed and afraid of the future.Mamie pampered her and gave her time; it seemed as if shed slept for a month.Then one evening Mamie spoke up.If you lay around one more day, you wont be able to walk.You have to do somethingits your choice.Get a job, go to school, something.Grace didnt want to be around people and she didnt believe she had any marketable skills.So she started helping in the flower shop, in the back, learning to make beautiful bouquets and arrangements.Portland was a funky, interesting, welcoming citynot too big, not too small, not uppity or flashy.Little by little, Grace came out of the back room to deal with customers, sometimes delivering flowers, even helping Mamie and Ross with weddings.No one made a fuss over her or asked her a lot of questions.Every time a major skating competition was covered by the mainstream or sports networks, Grace was glued to the TV, watching every move.And invariably thered be some short vignette about Izzy Banks, the girl who had it all and threw it all away.Izzy Banks, the brat on the ice, the fiercest competitor in figure skating, obviously couldnt take the pressure, one sportscaster noted of her.Brat.Boy, that stung.Her mother would usually get in touch, proving that Winnie couldnt ignore the competitions any more than Grace could.Shed pressure Grace to return home, return to skating, and the few conversations they had would end in a fight and they wouldnt speak again for months.A year before the 2014 Winter Games in Russia, when the dramatic story of her life might be publicly examined yet again, Grace went in search of a new place to settle and tackle life on her own.A little money had been set aside for her by her father and she found Pretty Petals, the shop Iriss mother had owned.Shed been in Thunder Point almost a year when the winter competition took place.When Grace couldnt watch it, shed record it.There had been the usual newsy dish about the more stunning events of the life of Izzy Banks, but no one seemed to recognize Grace.There were, thankfully, more interesting sports scandals that year.And Thunder Point was more a football than figure skating town.All shed ever wanted was a life she could control.A life that didnt include backbreaking labor, cruel rivals, endless travel across too many time zones, the occasional crazed fan or terrible loneliness.She wanted to know what it felt like to have real friends, not a staff of coaches, therapists, a security detail and competitors.Shed never had a boyfriend.She did, however, have more than one gold medal.Shed won every significant competition in the world.* * * It drizzled in the days following Christmas, typical Oregon Coast weather in winter.Graces only part time employee, a local married woman with a child in elementary school, came into the shop to resign.The womans life had grown too busy and complex, she complained.Grace knew it was going to create a challenge, even though all the woman had done was manage the front of the store.Grace was going to be back to doing it all, just as she had when the shop was new.Shed had the doorbell installed so she could lock the front door and go upstairs.The doorbell would buzz in her loft.And she could always close the shop to make deliveries when necessary.Shed ask around for a delivery boy.Business was typically down the week following a holiday and the days were much shorter so Grace closed the shop at four one afternoon and drove out to Coopers for a beer.She wasnt surprised to see Troy was back from visiting his family in Morro Bay.She was also not surprised that there was no one around the bar.People didnt hang out on the beach in cold, wet weather like this.But she had to admit surprise at seeing a big pile of books and papers beside his laptop on the bar next to his cup of coffee.She jumped on a bar stool.Welcome home.Did you have fun with the family?she asked.More or less.My sister has three little undisciplined kids and I slept on her couch.It was brutal.What can I get you?Beer?Was that a question or order?he asked.Beer, please.She glanced at the books.Homework?Lesson plans, he said, closing everything up, stacking it all and pushing it to one side.Were caught up in a couple of my classes so were going to have some fun.Im going to offer them a chance for extra credit if they research the history of something that interests themlike a rock band or in line skating or maybe a sport like kayaking.Im writing up a few examples.That almost sounds fun, but not enough fun.Did you get in any skiing over the holiday?Nope, he said, drawing her a draft.We played some golf, but the weather wasnt great.I might make a drive up to Mount Hood before I get back to work, maybe for a day.If I had more time and money Id check out Tahoe.So, you were the maid of honor.I was.Kind of short notice.I heard it wasnt exactly planned in advance...Thats how I heard it, too.Iris said they decided and just did it.They got a marriage license, called a judge Seth knew, told Seths family and got it done.I didnt even have time to order special flowers.She sipped a little of her beer.How are you handling it?Fine, he said.Good.Thats good.He leaned both hands on the bar.I went out with my little brother and got roaring drunk.Then I bought a Jeep I cant really afford.Oh, she said.Gosh, I hope you dont get your heart broken too often or youll go broke.Id wanted that Jeep anyway.And I deserved a good drunk.Is that what caused...She reached out toward the remnants of what looked like a healing bruise on his forehead.He ducked away from her fingers.I forgot I was sleeping on the couch, fell off and hit the coffee table.She couldnt help herself.She laughed.And my heart isnt broken, he insisted.Just a little coronary bruise.Gimme a week or two and itll be like nothing ever happened.Bullshit, she thought.He looked completely miserable.Youre very resilient, she said.She sipped her beer.I guess weve all been there, he said.Where?Heartbreak hotel.Hmm.Well, I dont think I have.I havent had my heart broken.Not by a guy, at least.Troy appeared to be momentarily frozen.Theres no polite way to ask this, but has your heart been broken by a girl?She giggled.There were times, and this was one of them, that it would feel so good to dump the story on someone, explain how a heart can be broken by ruthless competitors or the media.No, Troy.Im perfectly straight.Im into guys, I just havent been seriously involved.I guess its not in my nature to be tied down to one guy.No boyfriend, then?Are you fishing?she asked.Ive had some terrific boyfriends, just nothing serious.No steadies, engagements or live ins.Why havent I ever met any of them?he asked.She shrugged.I guess you werent around at the same time one of them was.I have a date later tonight, as a matter of fact.Oh?Whats he like?Troy asked.Hes kind of like a medieval knight, but has a gentle, sophisticated side.Big and brawny, very physical but disciplined.Hes also clever.Wise.Fantastic, Troy said.Where are you going?Were staying in, actually.We might watch a movie.Troy lifted an eyebrow.If I popped over unannounced, would I meet him?Very probably.Hes a little possessive but I completely ignore that.Like I said, Im not one to get serious.Lets talk about your girlfriends.I dont kiss and tell.She straightened.Humph.Yet you expect me to!I think you were bragging and maybe stretching the truth.Youre a little weird, Grace.The last time we hung out was Halloween and you were a witch, complete with missing teeth.And you put a hex on me.She smiled, remembering.Shed told him she was going to shrink his thing.Howd that work out?Turns out youre not much of a witch.So when you say your heart was never broken...Come on, Ive had my share of disappointments like everyone else, just havent had a romance end badly.We can moan about our various letdowns another time, when were both drowning our sorrows and feeling sorry for ourselves.Lets not do that now, okay?I have a feeling if you get started...Did Iris ask you to check on me?Absolutely not.She said you were very grown up and wished her every happiness.And I must say, buying a Jeep you cant afford is definitely mature.Then she grinned at him.Its a great Jeep.Maybe Ill take you off road in it sometime.Besides, I only have one person to worry about so if I have trouble paying the bills, its not like Im taking milk out of the babys mouth.She leaned her head on her hand.Youre all about fun, arent you, Troy?I work two jobs, Grace.I like to think of myself as active.And your favorite activity is?Its a toss up between diving and white water rafting or kayaking.One of the things that brought me to Oregon is the great river trips.I was torn between Colorado, Idaho and Oregon.Oregon had the job.In a town on the water.And youre a teacher for the time off?And the high pay, he said, smiling.Iris says youre the most dedicated teacher she knows, Grace said.Iris should raise her standards.Okay, so youre still a little pissy.I said Id need a week or two, he reminded her.He lifted his coffee cup to his lips.Whats your favorite thing to do with time off?She didnt answer right away.I need more balance in my life, she finally said.That shop gets too much of my time.But its a good workout.Flower arranging?he asked doubtfully.I beg your pardon!I stand all day, haul heavy buckets full of fresh cut flowers in water, deliver hundreds of pounds of arrangements to weddings and other events, get in and out of the back of that van all day, lift heavy pots and props and thats before I have to clean up and do the books.Its not for sissies.And for fun?I like to dance, she said.I dont very often, but its fun.I bet you were a cheerleader, he said.I was never a cheerleader.I think I couldve been.But I wasnt interested.You are the first girl in the history of the world, then.Im sure Im not, she said.When I was that age I was into ballet, sort of.They are not the same moves at all.That, like flower arranging, takes strength.Plus, I have a bike.He raised his eyebrows.A Harley?A mountain bike.Retired for the winter due to ice, rain, cold and slick roads.She drank the rest of her beer and put her money on the bar.Id love to stay and keep you company but I have a date.She started for the door and turned back to him.Im glad youre doing well, Troy.Id like to see what that Jeep can do off road.Maybe when the weather warms up.And dries up.Its a date, he said.But Grace knew it wasnt a date.She went back to the shop but didnt go inside.She went upstairs to her apartment, put some leftover lasagna from Carries deli into the microwave, changed into her soft pajamas and turned on the TV.While her lasagna cooled on the plate she went through the channel guide and settled on some reruns until her favorite shows came on.With her dinner on a tray and her e reader in her hand, she opened an old and beloved book The Wolf and the Dove and settled in with Wulfgar, her medieval knight.She loved him.And she trusted him.
