An extraordinary statement.With the exception of her careless attitude to health, Rosie had never exhibited any sign of brain malfunction.What are the symptoms of being fucked up?Ive got crap in my life that I wish I hadnt.And Im not good at dealing with it.Am I making sense?Of course, I said.Unwanted events occur and you lack certain skills for minimizing the personal impact.I thought when you said fucked up that there was some problem with your personality that you wanted to rectify.No, Im okay with being me.So what is the nature of the damage caused by Phil?Rosie did not have an instant reply to this critical question.Perhaps this was a symptom of being fucked up.Finally she spoke.Jesus, whats taking them so long with dinner?Rosie went to the bathroom, and I took the opportunity to unwrap the presents that Gene and Claudia had given me.They had driven me to the airport, so it was impossible not to accept the packages.It was fortunate that Rosie was not watching when I opened them.Genes present was a new book of sexual positions and he had inscribed it: In case you run out of ideas.He had drawn the gene symbol that he uses as his signature underneath.Claudias present was not embarrassing but was irrelevant to the tripa pair of jeans and a shirt.Clothes are always useful, but I had already packed a spare shirt and did not see a need for additional pants in only eight days.Gene had again misconstrued the current nature of my relationship with Rosie, but this was understandable.I could not explain the real purpose for taking Rosie to New York, and Gene had made an assumption consistent with his worldview.On the way to the airport, I had asked Claudia for advice on dealing with so much time in the company of one person.Remember to listen, said Claudia.If she asks you an awkward question, ask her why shes asking.Turn it back to her.If shes a psychology student, shell love talking about herself.Take notice of your emotions as well as logic.Emotions have their own logic.And try to go with the flow.In fact, Rosie spent most of the remainder of the flight to Los Angeles either sleeping or watching films, but confirmedtwicethat I had not offended her and she just needed time out.I did not complain.twenty three   We survived US Immigration.Previous experience had taught me not to offer observations or suggestions, and I did not need to use my letter of recommendation from David Borenstein at Columbia University characterizing me as a sane and competent person.Rosie seemed extremely nervous, even to someone who is poor at judging emotional states, and I was worried that she would cause suspicion and that we would be refused entry for no justifiable reason, as had happened to me on a previous occasion.The official asked, What do you do?and I said, Genetics researcher, and he said, Best in the world?and I said, Yes.We were through.Rosie almost ran toward Customs and then to the exit.I was several meters behind, carrying both bags.Something was obviously wrong.I caught up to her outside the automatic doors, reaching into her handbag.Cigarette, she said.She lit a cigarette and took a long drag.Just dont say anything, okay?If I ever needed a reason to give up, Ive got one now.Eighteen and a half hours.Fuck.It was fortunate that Rosie had told me not to say anything.I remained silent but shocked at the impact of addiction on her life.She finished her cigarette and we headed to the bar.It was only 7:48 a. m.  in Los Angeles, but we could be on Melbourne time until our arrival in New York.What was the deal about best geneticist on the planet?I explained that I had a special O 1 Visa for Aliens of Extraordinary Ability.I had needed a visa after the occasion when I was refused entry, and this was deemed the safest choice.O 1 visas were quite rare and yes was the correct answer to any question about the extraordinariness of my abilities.Rosie found the word alien amusing.Correction, hilarious.Since we did not have bags checked, and the immigration process had proceeded smoothly, I was able to implement my best case alternative and we caught an earlier flight to New York.I had made plans for the time gained through this maneuver.At JFK, I steered Rosie toward the AirTrain.We have two subway options.I suppose youve memorized the timetable, said Rosie.Not worth the effort.I just know the lines and stations we need for our journeys.I love New York.The layout is so logical, at least uptown from Fourteenth Street.When Rosie had telephoned, Isaac Eslers wife had been very positive about some contact from Australia and news from the reunion.On the subway, Rosie said, Youll need an alias.In case Esler recognizes your name from the Aspergers survey.I had already considered this.Austin, I said.From Austin Powers.International Man of Mystery.Rosie thought this was hilarious.I had made a successful, deliberate joke that was not related to exhibiting some quirk in my personality.A memorable moment.Profession?she asked.Hardware store owner.The idea appeared in my brain spontaneously.Okaaaaaay, said Rosie.Right.We took the E train to Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street and headed uptown.Wheres the hotel?Rosie asked, as I steered us toward Madison Avenue.Lower East Side.But we have to shop first.Fuck, Don, its after five thirty.Were due at the Eslers at seven thirty.We dont have time for shopping.I need time to change.I looked at Rosie.She was wearing jeans and shirtconventional attire.I could not see the problem, but we had time.I hadnt planned to go to the hotel before dinner, but since we arrived early  Don, Ive been flying for twenty four hours.We are doing nothing more with your schedule until Ive checked it for craziness.Ive scheduled four minutes for the transaction, I said.We were already outside the Herms store, which my research had identified as the worlds best scarf shop.I walked in and Rosie followed.The shop was empty except for us.Perfect.Don, youre not exactly dressed for this.Dressed for shopping!I was dressed for traveling, eating, socializing, museum visitingand shopping: running shoes, cargo pants, T shirt, and the sweater knitted by my mother.This was not Le Gavroche.It seemed highly unlikely that they would refuse to participate in a commercial exchange on the basis of my costume.I was right.Two women stood behind the counter, one (age approximately fifty five, BMI approximately nineteen) wearing rings on all eight fingers, and the other (age approximately twenty, BMI approximately twenty two) wearing huge purple glasses creating the impression of a human ant.They were very formally dressed.I initiated the transaction.I require a high quality scarf.Ring Woman smiled.I can help you with that.Its for the lady?No.For Claudia.I realized that this was not helpful but was not sure how to elaborate.And Claudia isshe made circles with her handwhat age?Forty one years, three hundred and fifty six days.Ah, said Ring Woman, so we have a birthday coming up.Just Claudia.My birthday was thirty two days away, so it surely did not qualify as coming up.Claudia wears scarves, even in hot weather, to cover lines on her neck that she considers unattractive.So the scarf does not need to be functional, only decorative.Ring Woman produced a scarf.What do you think of this?It was remarkably lightand would offer almost zero protection against wind and cold.But it was certainly decorative, as specified.Excellent.How much?We were running to schedule.This one is twelve hundred dollars.I opened my wallet and extracted my credit card.Whoa whoa whoa, said Rosie.I think wed like to see what else you have before we rush into anything.I turned to Rosie.Our four minutes is almost up.Ring Woman put three more scarves on the counter.Rosie looked at one.I copied her, looking at another.It seemed nice.They all seemed nice.I had no framework for discrimination.It continued.Ring Woman kept throwing more scarves on the counter and Rosie and I looked at them.Ant Woman came to help.I finally identified one that I could comment intelligently on.This scarf has a fault!Its not symmetrical.Symmetry is a key component of human beauty.Rosie had a brilliant response.Maybe the scarfs lack of symmetry will highlight Claudias symmetry.Ant Woman produced a pink scarf with fluffy bits.Even I could see that Claudia would not approve and dropped it immediately on the reject pile.Whats wrong with it?said Rosie.I dont know.Its unsuitable.Come on, she said, you can do better than that.Imagine who might wear it.Barbara Cartland, said Ring Woman.I was not familiar with this name, but the answer suddenly came to me.The Dean!At the ball.Rosie burst out laughing.Corrrrr ect.She pulled another scarf from the pile.What about this one?It was virtually transparent.Julie, I said automatically, then explained to Rosie and the two women about the Aspergers counselor and her revealing costume.Presumably she would not want a scarf to reduce its impact.This one?It was a scarf that I had quite liked because of its bright colors, but Rosie had rejected it as too loud.Bianca.Exactly.Rosie had not stopped laughing.You know more about clothes than you think you do.Ant Woman produced a scarf covered in pictures of birds.I picked it up; the pictures were remarkably accurate.It was quite beautiful.Birds of the world, Ant Woman said.Oh my God, no!said Rosie.Not for Claudia.Why not?Its extremely interesting.Birds of the world!Think about it.Gene.Scarves were being sourced from multiple locations, piling rapidly, being evaluated, tossed aside.It was happening so quickly that I was reminded of the Great Cocktail Night, except that we were the customers.I wondered if the women were enjoying their work as much as I had.In the end I left the choice to Rosie.She chose the first scarf that they had shown us.As we walked out of the store, Rosie said, I think I just wasted an hour of your life.No, no, the outcome was irrelevant, I said.It was so entertaining.Well, said Rosie, any time you need entertaining, I could use a pair of Manolo Blahniks.From the word pair, I guessed that she was referring to shoes.Do we have time?We had already used the time that Rosie had intended for the hotel visit.Im kidding, Im kidding.It was fortunate, as we had to move quickly to arrive at the Eslers on schedule.But Rosie needed to change.There was a bathroom at Union Square station.Rosie dashed in and reappeared looking amazingly different.That was incredible, I said.So quick.Rosie looked at me.Youre going like that?Her tone suggested dissatisfaction.These are my clothes, I said.I have a spare shirt.Show it to me.I reached into the bag to get the alternative shirt, which I doubted Rosie would prefer, and remembered Claudias gift.I showed the shirt to Rosie.It was a gift from Claudia, I said.Ive got jeans as well, if that helps.All hail Claudia, said Rosie.She earned the scarf.Well be late.Politely late is fine.Isaac and Judy Esler had an apartment in Williamsburg.My US cell phone card was working to specification, and we were able to navigate by GPS to the location.I hoped that forty six minutes met Rosies definition of politely late.Austin, remember, said Rosie, as she rang the bell.Judy answered the door.I estimated her age as fifty and her BMI as twenty six.She spoke with a New York accent and was concerned that we might have become lost.Her husband, Isaac, was a caricature of a psychiatrist: midfifties, short, receding hair, black goatee beard, BMI nineteen.He was not as friendly as his wife.They offered us martinis.I remembered the effect this drink had on me during the preparation for the Great Cocktail Night and resolved that I would have no more than three.Judy served us some fish based canaps and asked for details of our trip.She wanted to know whether we had been to New York before, what season it was in Australia (not a challenging question), and whether we planned to do any shopping and see any museums.Rosie handled all these questions.Isaacs off to Chicago in the morning, said Judy.Tell them what youll be doing there.Just a conference, said Isaac.He and I did not need to do a great deal of talking to ensure the conversation continued.He did ask me one thing before we moved to the dining room.What do you do, Austin?Austin runs a hardware store, said Rosie.A very successful one.Judy served a delicious meal based on farmed salmon, which she assured Rosie was sustainable.Having eaten very little of the poor quality airplane food, I enjoyed Judys meal immensely.Isaac opened some pinot gris from Oregon and was generous in refilling my glass.We talked about New York and the differences between Australian and American politics.Well, said Judy, Im so glad you could come.It makes up a little for missing the reunion.Isaac was so sorry not to be there.Not really, said Isaac.Revisiting the past is not something to do lightly.He ate the last piece of fish from his plate and looked at Rosie.You look a lot like your mother.She would have been a bit younger than you when I last saw her.Judy said, We got married the day after the graduation and moved here.Isaac had the biggest hangover at the wedding.Hed been a bad boy.She smiled.I think thats enough telling tales, Judy, said Isaac.It was all a long time ago.He stared at Rosie.Rosie stared at him.Judy picked up Rosies plate and mine, one in each hand.I decided that this was the moment to act, with everyone distracted.I stood and picked up Isaacs plate in one hand and then Judys.Isaac was too busy playing the staring game with Rosie to object.I took the plates to the kitchen, swabbing Isaacs fork on the way.I imagine Austin and Rosie are exhausted, said Judy, when we returned to the table.You said youre a hardware man, Austin?Isaac stood up.Can you spare five minutes to look at a tap for me?Its probably a job for a plumber, but maybe its just a washer.He means faucet, said Judy, presumably forgetting we came from the same country as Isaac.Isaac and I went down the stairs to the basement.I was confident I could help with the tap problem.My school vacations had been spent providing advice of exactly this kind.But as we reached the bottom of the stairs, the lights went out.I wasnt sure what had happened.A power failure?You okay, Don?said Isaac, sounding concerned.Im okay, I said.What happened?What happened is that you answered to Don, Austin.We stood there in the dark.I doubted that there were social conventions for dealing with interrogation by a psychiatrist in a dark cellar.How did you know?I asked.Two unsolicited communications from the same university in a month.An Internet search.You make good dancing partners.More silence and darkness.I know the answer to your question.But I made a promise that I would not reveal it.If I thought it was a matter of life or death, or a serious mental health issue, I would reconsider.But I see no reason to break the promise, which was made because the people involved had thought hard about what would be right.You came a long way for my DNA, and Im guessing you got it when you cleared the plates.You might want to think beyond your girlfriends wishes before you proceed.He turned on the light.Something bothered me as we walked up the stairs.At the top, I stopped.If you knew what I wanted, why did you let us come to your house?Good question, he said.Since you asked the question, Im sure you can work out the answer.I wanted to see Rosie.twenty four   Thanks to carefully timed use of sleeping pills, I woke without any feeling of disorientation at 7:06 a. m.   Rosie had fallen asleep in the train on the way to the hotel.I had decided not to tell her immediately about the basement encounter, nor mention what I had observed on the sideboard.It was a large photo of Judy and Isaacs wedding.Standing beside Isaac, dressed in the formal clothes required of a best man, was Geoffrey Case, who had only 370 days to live.He was smiling.I was still processing the implications myself, and I thought Rosie would probably have an emotional response that could spoil the New York experience.She was impressed that I had collected the DNA, and even more impressed that I had acted so unobtrusively when I picked up the dishes to assist.Youre in danger of learning some social skills.The hotel was perfectly comfortable.After we checked in, Rosie said she had been worried that I would expect her to share a room in exchange for my paying for her trip to New York.Like a prostitute!I was highly insulted.She seemed pleased with my reaction.I had an excellent workout at the hotel gym and returned to find the message light blinking.Rosie.Where were you?she said.In the gym.Exercise is critical in reducing the effects of jet lag.Also sunlight.Ive planned to walk twenty nine blocks in sunlight.Arent you forgetting something?Today is my day.And tomorrow.I own you until midnight Monday.Now get your butt down here.Im hanging out for breakfast.In my gym clothes?No, Don, not in your gym clothes.Shower, dress.You have ten minutes.I always have my breakfast before I shower.How old are you?said Rosie, aggressively.She didnt wait for the answer.Youre like an old manI always have my breakfast before I shower, dont sit in my chair, thats where I sit ...Do not fuck with me, Don Tillman.She said the last words quite slowly.I decided it was best not to fuck with her.By midnight tomorrow it would be over.In the interim, I would adopt the dentist mind set.It seemed I was in for a root canal filling.I arrived downstairs and Rosie was immediately critical.How long have you had that shirt?Fourteen years, I said.It dries very quickly.Perfect for traveling.In fact, it was a specialized walking shirt, though fabric technology had progressed significantly since it was made.Good, said Rosie.It doesnt owe you anything.Upstairs.Other shirt.Its wet.I mean Claudias shirt.And the jeans, while youre at it.Im not walking around New York with a bum.When I came down for the second attempt at breakfast, Rosie smiled.You know, youre not such a bad looking guy underneath.She stopped and looked at me.Don, youre not enjoying this, are you?Youd rather be by yourself in the museum, right?She was extremely perceptive.I get that.But youve done all these things for me, youve brought me to New York, and by the way, I havent finished spending your money yet.So I want to do something for you.I could have argued that her wanting to do something for me meant she was ultimately acting in her own interests, but it might provoke more of the dont fuck with me behavior.Youre in a different place, youre in different clothes.When the medieval pilgrims used to arrive at Santiago after walking hundreds of kilometers, they burned their clothes to symbolize that theyd changed.Im not asking you to burn your clothesyet.Put them on again Tuesday.Just be open to something different.Let me show you my world for a couple of days.Starting with breakfast.Were in the city with the best breakfasts in the world.She must have seen that I was resisting.Hey, you schedule your time so you dont waste it, right?Correct.So, youve committed to two days with me.If you shut yourself down, youre wasting two days of your life that someone is trying to make exciting and productive and fun for you.Im going to She stopped.I left the guidebook in my room.When I come down, were going to breakfast.She turned and walked to the elevators.I was disturbed by Rosies logic.I had always justified my schedule in terms of efficiency.But was my allegiance to efficiency or was it to the schedule itself?Was I really like my father, who had insisted on sitting in the same chair every night?I had never mentioned this to Rosie.I had my own special chair too.There was another argument that she had not presented, because she could not have known it.In the last eight weeks I had experienced two of the three best times of my adult life, assuming all visits to the Museum of Natural History were treated as one event.They had both been with Rosie.Was there a correlation?It was critical to find out.By the time Rosie came back, I had performed a brain reboot, an exercise requiring a considerable effort of will.But I was now configured for adaptability.So?she said.So, how do we find the worlds best breakfast?We found the Worlds Best Breakfast around the corner.It may have been the unhealthiest breakfast I had ever eaten, but I would not put on significant weight or lose fitness, brain acuity, or martial arts skills if I neglected them for two days.This was the mode my brain was now operating in.I cant believe you ate all that, said Rosie.It tasted so good.No lunch.Late dinner, she said.We can eat any time.Our server approached the table.Rosie indicated the empty coffee cups.They were great.I think we could both manage another.Huh?said the server.It was obvious that she hadnt understood Rosie.It was also obvious that Rosie had very poor taste in coffeeor she had done as I had and ignored the label coffee and was enjoying it as an entirely new beverage.The technique was working brilliantly.One regular coffee with cream and one regular coffee without cream ...please, I said.Sure.This was a town where people talked straight.My kind of town.I was enjoying speaking American: cream instead of milk, elevator instead of lift, check instead of bill.I had memorized a list of differences between American and Australian usage prior to my first trip to the US and had been surprised at how quickly my brain was able to switch into using them automatically.We walked uptown.Rosie was looking at a guidebook called Not for Tourists, which seemed a very poor choice.Where are we going?I asked.Were not going anywhere.Were there.We were outside a clothing store.Rosie asked if it was okay to go inside.You dont have to ask, I said.Youre in control.I do about shops.Its a girl thing.I was going to say, I suppose youve been on Fifth Avenue before, but I dont suppose anything with you.The situation was symmetrical.I knew not to suppose anything about Rosie, or I would have been surprised by her describing herself as a girl, a term that I understood to be unacceptable to feminists when referring to adult women.Rosie was becoming remarkably perceptive about me.I had never been beyond the conference centers and the museum, but with my new mind configuration, I was finding everything fascinating.A whole shop for cigars.The prices of jewelry.The Flatiron Building.The Museum of Sex.Rosie looked at the last of these and chose not to go in.This was probably a good decision: it might be fascinating, but the risk of a faux pas would be very high.Do you want to buy anything?said Rosie.No.A few minutes later, a thought occurred to me.Is there somewhere that sells mens shirts?Rosie laughed.On Fifth Avenue, New York City.Maybe well get lucky.I detected sarcasm, but in a friendly way.We found a new shirt of the same genre as the Claudia shirt at a huge store called Bloomingdales, which was not, in fact, on Fifth Avenue.We could not choose between two candidate shirts and bought both.My wardrobe would be overflowing!We arrived at Central Park.Were skipping lunch, but I could handle an ice cream, said Rosie.There was a vendor in the park, and he was serving both cones and prefabricated confections.I was filled with an irrational sense of dread.I identified it immediately.But I had to know.Is the flavor important?Something with peanuts.Were in the States.All ice creams taste the same.Bullshit.I explained about taste buds.Wanna bet?said Rosie.If I can tell the difference between peanut and vanilla, two tickets to Spider Man.On Broadway.Tonight.The textures will be different.Because of the peanuts.Any two.Your choice.I ordered an apricot and a mango.Close your eyes, I said.It wasnt really necessary: the colors were almost identical, but I didnt want her to see me tossing a coin to decide which one to show her.I was concerned that with her psychological skills she might guess my sequence.I tossed the coin and gave her an ice cream.Mango, guessed Rosie, correctly.Toss, heads again.Mango again.She picked the mango correctly three times, then the apricot, then the apricot again.The chances of her achieving this result randomly were one in thirty two.I could be ninety seven percent confident she was able to differentiate.Incredible.So, Spider Man tonight?No.You got one wrong.Rosie looked at me, very carefully, then burst out laughing.Youre bullshitting me, arent you?I cant believe it, youre making jokes.She gave me an ice cream.Since you dont care, you can have the apricot.I looked at it.What to say?She had been licking it.Once again she read my mind.How are you going to kiss a girl if you wont share her ice cream?For several minutes, I was suffused with an irrational feeling of enormous pleasure, basking in the success of my joke, and parsing the sentence about the kiss: Kiss a girl, share her ice cream.It was third person, but surely not unrelated to the girl who was sharing her ice cream right now with Don Tillman in his new shirt and jeans as we walked among the trees in Central Park, New York City, on a sunny Sunday afternoon.I needed the 114 minutes of time out back at the hotel, although I had enjoyed the day immensely.Shower, email, relaxation exercises combined with stretches.I emailed Gene, copying in Claudia, with a summary of our activities.Rosie was three minutes late for our 7:00 p. m.  foyer meeting.I was about to call her room when she arrived wearing clothes purchased that daywhite jeans and a blue T shirt thingand the jacket she had worn the previous evening.I remembered a Gene ism, something I had heard him say to Claudia.Youre looking very elegant, I said.It was a risky statement, but her reaction appeared to be positive.She did look very elegant.We had cocktails at a bar with the Worlds Longest Cocktail List, including many I did not know, and we saw Spider Man.Afterward, Rosie felt the story was a bit predictable but I was overwhelmed by everything, in a hugely positive way.I had not been to the theater since I was a child.I could have ignored the story and focused entirely on the mechanics of the flying.It was just incredible.We caught the subway back to the Lower East Side.I was hungry but did not want to break the rules by suggesting that we eat.But Rosie had this planned too.A 10:00 p. m.  booking at a restaurant called Momofuku Ko.We were on Rosie time again.This is my present to you for bringing me here, she said.We sat at a counter for twelve where we could watch the chefs at work.There were few of the annoying formalities that make restaurants so stressful.Any preferences, allergies, dislikes?asked the chef.Im vegetarian, but I eat sustainable seafood, said Rosie.He eats everythingand I mean everything.I lost count of the courses.I had sweetbreads and foie gras (first time!)and sea urchin roe.We drank a bottle of ros champagne.I talked to the chefs and they told me what they were doing.I ate the best food I had ever eaten.And I did not need to wear a jacket in order to eat.In fact, the man sitting beside me was wearing a costume that would have been extreme at the Marquess of Queensbury, including multiple facial piercings.He heard me speaking to the chef and asked me where I was from.I told him.How are you finding New York?I told him I was finding it highly interesting and explained how we had spent our day.But I was conscious that, under the stress of talking to a stranger, my manner had changedor to be more precise, revertedto my usual style.During the day, with Rosie, I had felt relaxed and had spoken and acted differently, and this style continued in my conversation with the chef, which was essentially a professional exchange of information.But informal social interaction with another person had triggered my regular behavior.And my regular behavior and speaking style is, I am well aware, considered odd by others.The man with the piercings must have noticed.You know what I like about New York?he said.There are so many weird people that nobody takes any notice.We all just fit right in.How was it?asked Rosie, as we walked back to the hotel.The best day of my adult life, I said.Rosie seemed so happy with my response that I decided not to finish the sentence: excluding the Museum of Natural History.Sleep in, she said.Nine thirty here and well do the brunch thing again.Okay?It would have been totally irrational to argue.twenty five   Did I cause any embarrassment?Rosie had been concerned that I might make inappropriate comments during our tour of the World Trade Center site.Our guide, a former firefighter named Frank, who had lost many of his colleagues in the attack, was incredibly interesting, and I asked a number of technical questions that he answered intelligently and, it seemed to me, enthusiastically.You may have changed the tone a bit, she said.You sort of moved the attention away from the emotional impact.So, I had reduced the sadness.Good.Monday was allocated to visiting popular tourist sights.We had breakfast at Katzs Deli, where a scene for a film called When Harry Met Sally was shot.We went to the top of the Empire State Building, famous as a location for An Affair to Remember.We visited MoMA and the Met, which were excellent.We were back at the hotel early4:32 p. m.   Back here at six thirty, said Rosie.What are we having for dinner?Hot dogs.Were going to the baseball game.I never watch sports.Ever.The reasons are obviousor should be to anyone who values their time.But my reconfigured mind, sustained by huge doses of positive reinforcement, accepted the proposition.I spent the next 118 minutes on the Internet, learning about the rules and the players.On the subway, Rosie had some news for me.Before she left Melbourne, she had sent an email to Mary Keneally, a researcher working in her field at Columbia University.She had just received a reply that Mary could see her tomorrow.But she wouldnt be able to make it to the Museum of Natural History.She could come Wednesday, but would I be okay by myself tomorrow?Of course I would.At Yankee Stadium we got beer and hot dogs.A man in a cap, estimated age thirty five, estimated BMI forty (i. e. , dangerously fat), sat beside me.He had three hot dogs!The source of the obesity was obvious.The game started, and I had to explain to Rosie what was happening.It was fascinating to see how the rules worked in a real game.Every time there was an event on the field, Fat Baseball Fan would make an annotation in his book.There were runners on second and third when Curtis Granderson came to the plate and Fat Baseball Fan spoke to me.If he bats in both of these guys, hell be leading the league in RBIs.What are the odds?I didnt know what the odds were.All I could tell him was that they were somewhere between 9.9 and 27.2 percent based on the batting average and percentage of home runs listed in the profile I had read.I had not had time to memorize the statistics for doubles and triples.Fat Baseball Fan nevertheless seemed impressed and we began a very interesting conversation.He showed me how to mark the program with symbols to represent the various events, and how the more sophisticated statistics worked.I had no idea sports could be so intellectually stimulating.Rosie got more beer and hot dogs and Fat Baseball Fan started to tell me about Joe DiMaggios streak in 1941, which he claimed was a uniquely odds defying achievement.I was doubtful, and the conversation was just getting interesting when the game ended, so he suggested we take the subway to a bar in Midtown.As Rosie was in charge of the schedule, I asked for her opinion, and she agreed.The bar was noisy and there was more baseball playing on a large television screen.Some other men, who did not appear to have previously met Fat Baseball Fan, joined our discussion.We drank a lot of beer and talked about baseball statistics.Rosie sat on a stool with her drink and observed.It was late when Fat Baseball Fan, whose actual name was Dave, said he had to go home.We exchanged email addresses and I considered that I had made a new friend.Walking back to the hotel, I realized that I had behaved in stereotypical male fashion, drinking beer in a bar, watching television, and talking about sports.It is generally known that women have a negative attitude to such behavior.I asked Rosie if I had offended her.Not at all.I had fun watching you being a guyfitting in.I told her that this was a highly unusual response from a feminist but that it would make her a very attractive partner to conventional men.If I was interested in conventional men.It seemed a good opportunity to ask a question about Rosies personal life.Do you have a boyfriend?I hoped I had used an appropriate term.Sure, I just havent unpacked him from my suitcase, she said, obviously making a joke.I laughed, then pointed out that she hadnt actually answered my question.Don, she said, dont you think that if I had a boyfriend, you might have heard about him by now?It seemed to me entirely possible that I would not have heard about him.I had asked Rosie very few personal questions outside the Father Project.I did not know any of her friends, except perhaps Stefan, who I had concluded was not her boyfriend.Of course, it would have been traditional to bring any partner to the faculty ball, and not to offer me sex afterward, but not everyone was bound by such conventions.Gene was the perfect example.It was plausible that Rosie had a boyfriend who did not like dancing or socializing with academics, was out of town at the time, or was in an open relationship with her.She had no reason to tell me.In my own life, I had rarely mentioned Daphne or my sister to Gene and Claudia or vice versa.They belonged to different parts of my life.I explained this to Rosie.Short answer, no, she said.We walked a bit further.Long answer: you asked what I meant about being fucked up by my father.Psychology 101our first relationship with a male is with our fathers.It affects how we relate to men forever.So, lucky me, I get a choice of two.Phil, whos fucked in the head, or my real father, who walked away from me and my mother.And I get this choice when Im twelve years old and Phil sits me down and has this I wish your mother could be here to tell you talk with me.You know, just the standard stuff your dad tells you at twelveIm not your dad, your mother, who died before you could know her properly, isnt the perfect person you thought she was, and youre only here because of your mother being easy, and I wish you werent so I could go off and have a life.He said that to you?Not in those words.But thats what he meant.I thought it highly unlikely that a twelve year oldeven a female future psychology studentcould correctly deduce an adult males unspoken thoughts.Sometimes it is better to be aware of ones incompetence in these matters, as I am, than to have a false sense of expertise.So I dont trust men.I dont believe theyre what they say they are.Im afraid theyre going to let me down.Thats my summary from seven years of studying psychology.This seemed a very poor result for seven years of effort, but I assumed she was omitting the more general knowledge provided by the course.You want to meet tomorrow evening?said Rosie.We can do whatever you want to do.I had been thinking about my plans for the next day.I know someone at Columbia, I said.Maybe we could go there together.What about the museum?Ive already compressed four visits into two.I can compress two into one.There was no logic in this, but I had drunk a lot of beer, and I just felt like going to Columbia.Go with the flow.See you at eightand dont be late, said Rosie.Then she kissed me.It was not a passionate kiss; it was on the cheek, but it was disturbing.Neither positive nor negative, just disturbing.I emailed David Borenstein at Columbia, then Skyped Claudia and told her about the day, omitting the kiss.Sounds like shes made a big effort, said Claudia.This was obviously true.Rosie had managed to select activities that I would normally have avoided but enjoyed immensely.And youre giving her the guided tour of the Museum of Natural History on Wednesday?No, Im going to look at the crustaceans and the Antarctic flora and fauna.Try again, said Claudia.twenty six   We took the subway to Columbia.David Borenstein had not replied to my email.I did not mention this to Rosie, who invited me to her meeting, if it did not clash with mine.Ill say youre a fellow researcher, she said.Id like you to see what I do when Im not mixing drinks.Mary Keneally was an associate professor of psychiatry in the Medical Faculty.I had never asked Rosie the topic of her PhD.It turned out to be environmental risks for early onset bipolar disorder, a serious scientific topic.Rosies approach appeared sound and well considered.She and Mary talked for fifty three minutes, and then we all went for coffee.At heart, Mary said to Rosie, youre a psychiatrist rather than a psychologist.You never thought of transferring to medicine?I came from a medical family, said Rosie.I sort of rebelled.Well, when youve finished rebelling, weve got a great MD program here.Right, said Rosie.Me at Columbia.Why not?In fact, since youve come all this way ...She made a quick phone call, then smiled.Come and meet the dean.As we walked back to the medical building, Rosie said to me, I hope youre suitably impressed.We arrived at the deans office and he stepped out to meet us.Don, he said.I just got your email.I havent had a chance to reply.He turned to Rosie.Im David Borenstein.And youre with Don?We all had lunch at the faculty club.David told Rosie that he had supported my O 1 visa application.I didnt lie, he said.Anytime Don feels like joining the main game, theres a job for him here.Coal oven pizza is supposedly environmentally unsound, but I treat statements of this kind with great suspicion.They are frequently emotionally based rather than scientific and ignore full life cycle costs.Electricity good, coal bad.But where does the electricity come from?Our pizza at Arturos was excellent.Worlds Best Pizza.
