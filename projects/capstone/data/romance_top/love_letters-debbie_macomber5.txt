Burying our feelings, our pain, will soon devour our marriage and destroy us.If you wont do it for me, then do it for Jaxon and Collin.More than anything, they need the security of a mother and father who love each other.Roy stood and walked to the far side of the room, keeping his back to her.You have no one to blame but yourself, Maggie.What you want is for me to step forward and accept the blame, but it wasnt me that got so drunk and ended up in bed with someone I met in a bar.That was all you, sweetheart.All you.Youre the one who stepped over the line.Way over the line, I might add.Really?she asked, not bothering to hide the sarcasm.All me?I find that interesting from the man who was carrying on an affair with some old girlfriend he hooked up with on Facebook.At least I never slept with her.No, but you might as well have.You gave her everything you vowed to give me.See what I mean?He spat out the words as if he was a dog chewing meat off a bone.Our little talk, as you call it, is merely an excuse to throw blame on me.Maggie went still and quiet.Raising their voices, arguing, wouldnt help matters.After our blowup, after I found out about Katherine, I figured our marriage was over, so what did it matter what I did.Id never been more devastated in my life.Ill be the first one to admit that what I did was beyond stupid and wrong.Im horrified that I would drink myself into oblivion to the point that I would sleep with another man.You of all people should recognize how much out of character that was for me.Roy didnt answer.He made me feel attractive and desirable   Of course he did.He wanted to get you in bed, and he succeeded, didnt he?Maggie wasnt sure how much more of this she could take.You want to blame me, and thats understandable, but I think you should take a long, hard look in the mirror.Once more Roy went silent.He didnt understand, and Maggie wasnt sure she could explain what shed felt that dreadful night.In her eyes, her husband had betrayed her even if the relationship with Katherine hadnt gone to the point that they were having sex.Clearly, that was where the two were headed.Maggie needed Roy to do more than apologize, to admit hed wronged her and their children.What she needed was for her husband to realize that shed been hurt and what she sought was to be healed.I dont need a crystal ball to look into the future, Roy, she said, doing her best to remain calm.Cruel, thoughtless words would soon demolish everything theyd spent the last ten years building.Every time we have a disagreement youre going to throw that night in my face.You mean the way you throw Katherine in my face?Yes.She couldnt be any more direct than that.He frowned and rammed his fingers through his tousled hair.So what do we do?I love you, Roy.Heart and soul love you.This has the power to destroy us, destroy our family, destroy our future.We have to learn to forgive each other.It took him a moment to agree and nod.It isnt easy.No, it isnt, she said.Weve both been badly hurt.He turned his head and looked away.For the longest time, he said nothing and then seemed to reach a decision.He turned to face her.Im sorry, Maggie, so sorry.I could never have believed accepting Katherine as a Facebook friend would lead to this.It seemed so innocent at the time.Forgive me, please.And Im sorry, too, so, so sorry.Can you find it in you to forgive me?Her husband came across the room and reached for her then, bringing her into a tight embrace, his arms hugging her close.I love you.Ive always loved you and Ill go to my grave loving you.Maggie wanted to weep but held the tears at bay.Youre a good husband and a wonderful father and God knows I love you.Roy exhaled as though hed released a heavy burden from his heart.Maggie felt the weight lift from her shoulders, too.Roy hadnt wanted to have this talk, and, frankly, she wouldve liked to have avoided it as well, but it was necessary.There was only so much pain and disillusionment they could ignore before it damaged them both beyond repair.Im hungry, Roy announced all at once, and he headed into the bathroom to shower.Maggie smiled.She was hungry, too, and had bright hopes for a new day.It felt as if they were starting over.It wouldnt be easy, but it was a start in the right direction.Theyd both made an effort to forgive the other, each accepting blame for their part in this mess.Roy was in and out of the shower in ten minutes, and by then Maggie had dressed and was applying her makeup.What do you think of driving out to see Mount Saint Helens?he asked, and placed his hands on her shoulders and kissed the side of her neck.Maggie shrugged, not overly excited to return to the site of the 1980 volcanic eruption.We were there once before, remember?True, but its an amazing site.She agreed.I think Id rather go someplace we havent been or go into the city.Okay by me.Lets ask Jo Marie for a few recommendations.Perfect.When they came down the stairs, Jo Marie had homemade muffins and orange juice laid out in the breakfast room.She offered them a feast, and both Roy and Maggie took advantage of the fried bacon, stuffed French toast, and eggs.Jo Marie offered a variety of ideas as to how they could spend their day.Bremerton has a lot to offer and its close by, she suggested first, listing a number of tourist attractions and museums that were a short foot ferry ride away.Then theres the Olympic National Forest.Did you know Washington State has the only rain forest in the continental U. S. ?No.Maggie had lived her entire life in Washington State and didnt have a clue.Some of the hikes inside the forest will take your breath away, the innkeeper mentioned.Roy looked to Maggie as if to say he was interested in a short hike if she was.Speaking of museums, theres a Museum of Glass in Tacoma that displays Dale Chihulys work.Really breathtaking, or so Ive heard, Jo Marie continued.I havent visited yet myself, but I plan to make an excuse to go soon.Ive heard nothing but raves about it, and theres a car museum close by as well.Maggie noticed how Roys eyes lit up at the mention of the car museum.He had a long standing love for cars.That gives us several options, Roy said, and reached for another slice of bacon.Take a light sweater, Jo Marie said, as she refilled Roys coffee mug.Its overcast this morning, and according to the weather, theres a chance of rain later in the day.Will do.Maggies stomach felt a bit queasy.Ill get our jackets, she told Roy as he went over a map with Jo Marie.Hurrying up the stairs, Maggie reached for her purse and what else theyd need for the day, when she stopped cold.All at once she felt dreadful and rushed into the bathroom just in time to lose her breakfast.It hit her then like a two by four slamming into her midsection.The only other time in her life when shed thrown up like this, outside of the time when she was sick with the flu, was when she was pregnant with her sons.Slumping onto the bed, Maggie felt the blood drain out of her face.Dear God in heaven, she prayed fervently, please dont let me be pregnant.14     Once Roy and Maggie headed out to explore and enjoy the day, I brought the dishes and leftover food back into the kitchen.Rover sat next to his dish, reminding me that in my eagerness to feed my guests Id overlooked him.That happened, but rarely.My mind seemed to be on other matters lately, most of which revolved around Paul.Sorry, Rover, I said, and bent down to pat his head.He luxuriated in the attention and lifted his chin.He enjoyed it when I stroked his chin and neck, and seemed to sigh.I spoil you rotten.I brought the bag of dog food from the pantry floor and filled his bowl.Rover quickly dug into it, spilling the nuggets over the sides of his dish in his eagerness.He seemed to think if he didnt gobble it up right away someone else would nudge in and cheat him out of his meal.Id just tucked the bag back inside the pantry when the phone rang.It was the business line instead of my cell.Rose Harbor Inn, I said, making an effort to sound as crisp and professional as a corporate reservations operator.Jo Marie?It was my mother.Hi, Mom.Youre calling on the reservation line for the inn.I am?You have so many phone numbers I hardly know which one is which.It baffles me that I can have two children and between them they have six or seven phone numbers.I dont know if I consider this progress or not.I couldnt help but laugh.She was right.I had three phone numbers and I knew Todd, my brother, had that many as well.In addition, Jennifer, his wife, had her own cell, and it wouldnt be long before his two children had their own phones, each with individual numbers.By all that was fair, Mom was onto something.Im calling about Sunday afternoon, Mom said, getting right to the point of her call.You wouldnt by chance happen to be free, would you?Let me check.I got on the computer and brought up my calendar.Unfortunately, I had three sets of guests due to arrive midday.What do you have in mind?I was thinking its been a while since we last saw you.It really hadnt been that long.A month, maybe.Since Paul died, my parents had been keeping close track of me.Cant you break away for just one afternoon and come to Seattle for dinner?Mom asked, her voice soft and pleading.With guests leaving and others checking in, it would be almost impossible to take time off.One of the downfalls of owning the inn was the lack of free time.Peggy Beldon had warned me about this and suggested I make contingency plans in case of emergencies.Id taken her advice and hired a couple local girls to help.They were good, but I wasnt confident they were up to taking over for me entirely.Sorry, Mom, I dont think I can make it.I hated letting my family down, but I really didnt feel comfortable leaving the inn.Oh, that is disappointing.I had a suggestion, though, and I hoped it would work.Could you have dinner in Cedar Cove?Yes, I suppose, she said, after a short hesitation.Todd and Jennifer are free, and you know how hard it is to get the family together these days.Brians involved in soccer and Shaunas constantly on the go.That was true.My nephew and niece, although young, were already involved in a number of activities.Shauna was a Brownie and took piano lessons, and Brian played soccer and had recently joined Cub Scouts.And this was in addition to all their church activities.I could host the dinner.To me, this was the logical solution.But, Jo Marie, thats a lot of work when youve already got your hands full.Mom, please.I cook for a crowd nearly every day.Id enjoy hosting the family.Besides, it would give me an opportunity to show you how far my culinary skills have come along.Are you sure?Mom sounded hesitant.Im positive.Im a good cook.I dont know what Mom thought I did all day.But in the last year Id learned more about putting meals together than I had in my first thirty seven years.Still, she hesitated and I could almost see her chewing on her lower lip, a habit she had when uneasy about making a decision.This is a dinner, remember, not breakfast.True.No argument there, and while I was an old hand when it came to breakfast, I wasnt as adept at dinners.Ill look through my cookbooks and come up with something wonderful.Mom chuckled.You amaze me, Jo Marie.Does that mean youd be willing to come my way?On second thought, I might have been a bit hasty in asking the entire family over for a home cooked meal.Before I took over the inn, I would have either taken them out to a local restaurant or brought in takeout.Ill need to check with Todd and Jennifer, but seeing that this may be the only way well get a chance to see you, I doubt theyll have any objection.My mind was abuzz with ideas of what I might serve.The farmers market was in session and fresh fish were often sold from one of the fishing boats that docked at the marina.My dad especially enjoyed fresh salmon.I could steam clams as well.Id bake the salmon, put together a green salad loaded down with vegetables from my garden, and pick up bread from the bakery.For a side dish, Id serve Dads favorite rice, a recipe handed down in his family, made with raisins and pine nuts.In a matter of seconds I had the entire menu.Thatll be seven of us, Mom reminded me.My table would easily seat seven and often up to twelve.That was when it struck me.Would it be all right if I invited someone?Who, dear?I could be opening up a can of worms.Still, I couldnt resist.Mark Taylor.Who?Mark.Hes my handyman.The one who put in the rose garden?Oh, and wasnt it Mark who crafted the sign for the inn?Thats him.I should have thought of this earlier.My mother had a gift, a knack for reading people in the most natural, nonthreatening way.I would love for her to get a feel for Mark.I couldnt think of a better way than to have her sit across from him at dinner.My mother was wonderful with people, and if anyone could get Mark engrossed in conversation, it would be her.My mother went suspiciously quiet.You wouldnt mind, would you?Perhaps Id misjudged the intention of this family dinner.Id assumed it was just another get together because itd been a while.Apparently not.It seemed there was an agenda at play that I knew nothing about.Do you like  Mark?Mom asked in a small, quiet voice that wasnt quite like her.Like?I was beginning to get the picture.Mom, theres nothing romantic between us.Marks a friend.Are the two of you involved?No, I said automatically.What was I thinking?By suggesting I invite Mark Id given my mother the wrong impression about my relationship with him.No way, I repeated for emphasis.Mom spoke softly, as if she was dealing with a child.You seem to talk about him a great deal, Jo Marie.I wasnt aware of that and would make a point of keeping him out of any future conversations.If I did mention Mark, it was no doubt in reference to something hed done to irritate me, which he often did.Now I was forced to own up to the truth.I have a specific reason for wanting him to join us for dinner.Oh?Moms interest was instantly piqued.I could hear it in her voice.I see quite a bit of Mark.I shouldnt have admitted that.It would only add fuel to Moms suspicions.That didnt come out right, I amended quickly.The only reason I see Mark as much as I do is because hes been working at the inn on a variety of projects.I thought he did a lovely job with the rose garden, and you did mention you planned to have him build a gazebo.I might have said something about that in passing.I feared I was digging myself into an even deeper hole every time I opened my mouth.Marks starting on the gazebo now, but the point is, Mom, I said, not wanting to get sidetracked with her questions and comments.I dont really know him.What do you mean?Mark rarely talks about himself, and you have such a great rapport with people.You connect easily with others, and I thought you might  you know.Get him to talk   I guess, but in a natural, nonthreatening way.Get a feel for him, that sort of thing.Because youre curious?I  yes, I suppose, I admitted reluctantly.Why do you want to know more about him, Jo Marie?My mother could get right to the point when she felt the need.Well, because  I struggled to find the right words.Hes a friend, and I know practically nothing about him.I dont want to hound him with questions.Heaven knew Id already tried that and failed miserably.My mothers talent was equal parts being genuinely interested in others and being a good listener.If Mark would open up to anyone, it would be my sweet natured mother.W e l l, Mom said, dragging out the word, in that case, invite Mark for no other reason than Id enjoy meeting him, and I know your father would as well, as often as youve mentioned his name.Mom and I discussed the time for dinner and she promised to get back to me regarding the availability of my brother and his family.We hoped it would all work out.We ended the conversation and Rover stood by the kitchen door, letting me know he wanted out.As I suspected, Mark had arrived with another load of lumber for the gazebo.Morning.I stood on the front porch and called out to him while Rover wandered about the yard, carefully choosing the exact blade of grass to water.Morning, he returned.Hed apparently been at work for quite some time, because the bed of his truck was nearly empty.How about a cup of coffee?I asked.He hesitated, as though he needed a bit more convincing in order to pull him away from his task.I baked Peggys blueberry muffins this morning.He paused, a long two by four balanced across the top of his shoulder.Are the blueberries out of Peggys garden?They are.He nodded, but without a lot of enthusiasm.I suppose I could help you out and eat a couple of those muffins.Help me out.Your generosity knows no bounds, I said, and rolled my eyes.While he set down the last of his load I returned to the house and poured us each a cup of coffee and then set two muffins on a plate.I carried both outside, where Mark stood waiting.When he saw me, he walked over to the porch, sat on the top step, and removed his work gloves.I settled down next to him with Rover between us.I have an invitation for you, I said, and handed him the plate with the muffins.Oh?How would you feel about having dinner here with me on Sunday?I thought it best not to mention that my family would be joining us, at least not right away.He considered the invite.What are you serving?Salmon, I think.Ill walk down to the farmers market in a bit and see what the fishing boats have to offer.They had tuna last week, he mentioned.Yes, I know.Itd been fresh and snatched up before I made it down to the marina.Not that it really matteredI wasnt keen on tuna, fresh or otherwise.This time of year you can get Hood Canal shrimp, too.The shrimp season was short, and while expensive, they were worth the price.The same with Copper River salmon, which was available only in spring.Salmon, Mark repeated.I like salmon, but I thought it wasnt your favorite fish.It isnt, but it is my dads.The minute the words were off my lips I wanted to snatch them back.I didnt want Mark to know my parents would be at the dinner and yet the first thing I did was blurt it out.Mark reached for a muffin, and his hand paused in midair.Your fathers coming?Im not sure yet.A slight exaggeration; Mom had said shed be getting back to me.Will anyone else be there that I should know about?he asked innocently enough before he bit into the muffin.Crumbles fell unheeded onto the second step down.Rover lowered his head and quickly devoured what had fallen and then looked up, eager for more.Dont know yet, I said.Okay, let me rephrase that question, Mark said.How many other people have you invited?I would make a terrible covert spy.The very thing Id hoped to hide until Id gotten a commitment Id inadvertently blurted out in the first few minutes.Jo Marie?Six.I invited my family to dinner.Mark sipped his coffee and reached for the second muffin.He broke off a small portion and fed it to Rover.Why do you want me to join this family function?Why not?They admire the work youve done around the inn.I thought it was time they met you.Why?he pressed again.Because.I could feel the blood filling my face, reddening my cheeks.He stared at me as if Id spoken in a foreign language.Wouldnt you like to meet my family?I asked, turning the tables on him.Not necessarily.I laughed and shook my head.Tell me how you really feel, why dont you?I joked.I could see my entire plan falling to pieces right before my eyes.Mark frowned.Im not good with social situations.This isnt social; its family.Your family, he reminded me.I ignored that.You attended my open house.He squinted his eyes as if his attending the event Id held last spring had nothing to do with our current conversation.That was a social event and you did fine.If you remember, he said stiffly, Id recently broken my leg and was on heavy pain medication.I wasnt myself.Thats ridiculous.I was losing my patience with him.Now, are you going to accept my invitation or not?Not, he said, without even blinking an eye.I was sorely disappointed and tried hard not to show it.As silly as it sounded, my feelings were hurt.In rejecting the invitation it felt as if he was rejecting me.After all these months Id counted him as a friend, but I could see that I was wrong.I might consider him that way, but he held no such feelings for me.I was a job with the benefits of cookies and muffins tossed in.Dont take it personal.Im not, I lied.He must have read the disappointment in my eyes.Like I said, I avoid this kind of situation.I looked away and nodded.Its all right, I understand.Its not my thing, Jo Marie, he reiterated.Its no big deal, I said, doing my utmost to be as chipper as possible.I stood and brushed off the stray crumbs that had fallen onto my pant legs.Rover was instantly there to lick them up.I better get back to work.Yeah, me, too, Mark said, but he didnt make an effort to move away.As I headed inside the inn, my shadow and constant companion, Rover, chose to remain with Mark.As the screen door closed I heard Mark murmur to Rover, Thing is, I dont know that Id fit in with Jo Maries family.I wanted to reassure Mark, but hesitated.Just maybe I was the one in the wrong, looking to use the dinner invitation for my own purposes.15     I appreciate how far youve stepped out of your comfort zone for me, Tom said, as he manned the helm of the sailboat.The wind helped them slice through the waters of Puget Sound.He pointed out Vashon Island, which was off in the far distance.Theyd sailed all the way around Blake Island as he did a quick tutorial on the techniques of sailing.Ellie listened intently and wished she could be more help, but this was an area with which she was completely unfamiliar.Being with Tom helped calm her pounding heart.At first Ellie had felt ill at ease sailing, but hed been more than patient and encouraging.While being on the water was foreign to her, it didnt take long before she was able to relax and enjoy the sun, the wind, and the boat.I cant believe were actually sailing, she said.The thing that struck her was how smoothly the vessel moved, gliding through the green water.The only sound was the flapping of the sails when the wind changed direction.No wonder Tom loved sailing.The day was perfect, the weather ideal, or so he had explained.He had her sit close to his side, and he placed his arm around her shoulders.The sun felt good on her skin, warming her.Every now and again it would hide behind a billowing white cloud, and Ellie was grateful shed thought to bring her sweater with her.Are you going to tell me about my surprise?she asked, eager to discover what it was he had for her.He seemed a bit apprehensive about it, and she hoped to convince him to share his concern.Not yet.He didnt give her the opportunity to question him further.Instead, he bent down and kissed her, his mouth lingering over hers.His kiss was deep and hungry, and left her breathless with wonder that this could actually be happening to her.When the kiss ended, Ellie rested her head against his shoulder.Thank you, she whispered.For the kiss?Yes, she said, content and happy, happier than she could ever remember being.For everything, really.I hope I wont disappoint you, Tom said, so low that at first Ellie wasnt sure shed heard him correctly.Disappoint me?she repeated.That would be impossible.Youre everything I could ever have hoped for and beyond.Im better looking than you thought, right?he teased.Indeed.Indeed?he chided.Thats an old fashioned word, isnt it?Im an old fashioned kind of girl, I guess.Tom rubbed his chin across her crown, and the wind whipped tendrils of dark hair against her cheek.Youve lived a sheltered life.She couldnt deny it.My mother and grandparents saw to that.Didnt you ever wonder why they felt it was so important to keep you protected?he asked.She hadnt, not really.To Ellie, that was the way it was; she didnt know any different.No, actually, I never thought much about it.Youre right, you probably wouldnt.Although she couldnt see his face, Ellie heard the frown in his voice.I was the only grandchild, and my grandmother lived in fear that something bad would happen to me, she said, thinking back over her youth.Like what?Ellie sighed, nestled into his warm embrace.I never knew exactly, but Im pretty sure it had something to do with my father.Youre joking?Im not, Ellie assured him.She recalled comments about her father that were abruptly cut off the instant she walked into the room.More than once she could remember hearing her fathers name mentioned in furious whispers.What did they think he would do?Tom asked, and it sounded as if he was offended, although it didnt make sense that he should be.Ellie wasnt entirely sure.I cant say.In retrospect, it seems rather odd, doesnt it?It does.Maybe they were afraid your father might come and take you away.That would explain why they decided you should be homeschooled.Ellie automatically shook her head.There were more reasons than that.Like what?he asked.You have to remember, my grandparents were older.Once when I came down with the flu, I very generously shared the bug with my grandmother and she ended up in the hospital.Everyone was deathly worried about her.And you felt guilty.I was in preschool at the time.I still recall feeling bad that my grandmother would be so sick because of me.Naturally, shed been too young to understand that a childhood ailment would hit an elderly woman much harder.In other words, homeschooling you was protection in case you inadvertently brought home a virus?Yes, but being taught at home wasnt a bad thing, Tom.My grandmother was my teacher because Mom worked during the day.We went on all kinds of field trips, and lessons were always fun.She didnt worry about getting sick when she took you around?Did she think your being with her would ward off any bugs?Youre being silly.No, Im serious.Wasnt she worried?Apparently not.That didnt make a lot of sense to Ellie, now that she thought about it.What about your social development?Tom asked.Were you allowed to have friends?A few.It wasnt bad, Tom.You make it sound like I was in prison.It wasnt like that.What happened once you were old enough to date?This was harder to explain.You seem to think I didnt date, but I did, she said, somewhat defensively.Did your grandparents and mother have an approved list of boys they considered acceptable?he asked.Again, she detected a slight hint of derision in his voice, as if he was angry on her behalf.And, really, it wasnt necessary.She had been loved and sheltered from many of the pitfalls of life.By the time I was old enough to date, my grandparents had both died.He didnt ask about either of them passing, and Ellie was grateful.She and her mother had both taken their deaths hard.Tell me about your first date, Tom urged.Ellie laughed, and Tom joined her, chuckling himself.Whats so funny?he asked.Nothing.Tell me, he insisted.I was in braces and my mother insisted I wear a dress and I was so terribly shy I dont think I said two words the entire evening.Thankfully, we went to the movies and a lot of conversation wasnt required.How old were you?Thirteen?Fourteen?Sixteen.She felt his arm around her tighten ever so slightly.Sixteen, he repeated.I went to a dance once when I was fifteen, but no one asked me to dance.Were the boys in Oregon blind?he asked incredulously.Ellie smiled, loving the way he seemed to be annoyed on her behalf.Then, because she wanted to change the subject, she asked, Whats your earliest memory?My earliest memory, Tom repeated slowly.Let me see.Ah, yes.He kissed her temple before he continued.I was with my parents on a picnic.Mom spread out a blanket and we had a wonderful lunch.There was a lazy river close by, and Id gone down to look for minnows with a cup in my hand, intent on going fishing.With a cup?Its the best way, he insisted.How old were you?Tom shrugged.I must have been three or four.I remember seeing a small fish and I wanted to catch it in my cup so I could show my dad what a good fisherman I was.I made the mistake of stepping into the water.And slipped?It might have been a lazy river, but the current knocked me off my feet and down I went.I remember hearing my mother scream and my dad racing out into the water.He made a tremendous splash and caught me under my arms and scooped me up.Did you lose the fish?she teased.And the cup.I was more upset about that than anything.He kissed her again and then asked, Whats your first memory?I read once that almost always a first memory involves something that frightens us.Were you frightened?I was, but it wasnt by being swept away in a current.My mother put me down for a nap and I wasnt tired.How old were you?I dont know, but I was still in the crib.The only reason I know that is because I can remember seeing the bars as I pressed my cheek against the sheet.So young.Really young, she agreed.What happened?Ellie closed her eyes.It was as if itd happened only a few years ago; the memory remained vivid in her mind.For whatever reason, my mother had a picture of my father on the dresser.Shed taken it out and looked at it and hadnt put it away  thats the only thing I could guess.Do you think she loved him?I do, in her own way, but she was afraid, I think.Of what?Dont sidetrack me, Im still in my crib.Right, sorry.Ellie enjoyed this.It seemed there wasnt anything she couldnt talk to Tom about.I wanted to see my fathers picture.Mom had this crocheted runner my grandmother made for her across the top of her dresser.I thought that if I tugged on the runner, I might be able to reach to the photograph of my father.So what happened?Mom had a vase on the dresser, too, an antique that she loved and  Tom broke into her story.The vase fell and shattered into a thousand pieces.Hey, this is my story, she said, and elbowed him in the ribs.Thats what happened, though, isnt it?Yup.To this day, Ellie could remember looking at that broken vase through the slats of her crib.Eventually, she fell asleep the way she was meant to, but as she drifted off her mind was full of doom and gloom and the expectation that she was going to get a spanking.And you were afraid, Tom said for her.So what happened?I dont remember anything after that.So what you read is true in both our cases.It was a frightening moment for each of us.Yes, it was.Did you get to see your fathers photograph?No.As young as I was, I was afraid if I tugged on the runner again that something else might fall and break.Even at three or four you were one smart cookie.Ellie could see that Tom had turned the sailboat around, and they started back toward the cove.I spoke to my mom last night after I got back to the inn, she mentioned, hoping to sound as though it was nothing to talk to her mother after midnight.I bet she was worried.Understandably so.She didnt want to paint a picture of her mother as a control freak, although in some ways Virginia was.Right, Tom concurred, but he didnt sound convinced.You were meeting a stranger.Someone not on her approved list, someone she didnt know.You werent a stranger to me, Ellie reminded him.I want you to meet Mom one day, and I dont want you to think badly of her.Shes been a good mother.Overprotective.Yes.Domineering.To a certain extent, yes, but in the gentlest of ways.Shes chain linked her life to yours, Ellie.He spoke the truth, and while Ellie had never heard it said in exactly those terms, Tom was right.It was as if she couldnt make a decision without her mother making her own wishes known.Other than meeting me, have you ever done anything your mother disapproved of you doing?he asked.Of course I have, Ellie insisted.He chuckled like he found that hard to believe.Like what?Well, for one thing, on my first date she wanted me to wear my white dress and I insisted on wearing my pink one.Why not the white one?Because I looked like I was in a wedding party.Tom laughed.Who won that disagreement?Ellie sighed.He would ask that.Mom.So you were dressed as a bridesmaid on your first date.Wrong, she was quick to correct him.I resembled the flower girl more than a bridesmaid.As the marina came into view, Tom stood.Do you think you could hold on to the helm for a couple minutes?Me?Dont worry.Itll be fine.Im going forward to lower the sails, but Ill be back before you even notice Im away.Ellie sincerely doubted that.Okay.Talk about being out of her comfort zone.She grabbed hold of the helm with both hands.Earlier hed shown her how to make sure the wind was in the sails by keeping an eye on a small piece of yarn attached to the mast.True to his word, Tom had the two sails lowered within a matter of minutes, and then they motored toward the marina.Ellie glanced up.The waterfront was alive with activity.The sidewalk was crowded with those enjoying the park.Off to one side was the farmers market, and it seemed to be doing a brisk business.Tom moored the boat in the same slot from which theyd left.With only a minimum of effort, he leaped onto the dock and secured the craft.Then he took extra care to store the sails and leave the boat in the same condition in which theyd found it.When he finished, he looked up and hesitated before glancing back at her.Are you ready for your surprise?he asked.Sure.That odd look was back in his eyes.She read uncertainty and something else she couldnt quite identify.Taking her by the hand, he led her up the ramp to the waterfront park.Theres someone here I want you to meet, he said.His hand tightened around hers.Who?Tom didnt look at her.My dad, he said.A middle aged man stepped toward them and a chill ran down Ellies arms.This is my dad, Tom said.My stepdad, he amended.Hello, Ellie said, smiling at the other man.He was attractive, with silver hairs at his temples adding to his appeal.His eyes were dark and serious, and in them she read doubt and that same uncertainty shed seen in Tom.Im Eleanor, she said.Youre Ellie, the other man said.And Im your father.16     Maggies mind was in absolute turmoil.This couldnt be happening.She couldnt be pregnant, she just couldnt.A pregnancy would ruin her life, her marriage, her future.You okay?Roy asked, as they left Cedar Cove, driving around the cove.After reviewing their options, theyd decided to take the Bremerton ferry into Seattle and spend the day on the waterfront.Itd been several years since theyd visited Pike Place Market and enjoyed the multitude of tourist activities the city had to offer.Im fine, Maggie assured her husband, smiling for all she was worth, but at the moment, that wasnt much.As it was, she couldnt be sure how long she would be able to hide her fear and terror from her husband.One thing was for certain: She couldnt, she wouldnt blurt everything out the way she had before when she confessed what shed done.That had proved disastrous.Their marriage had barely managed to survive one hit.Another in such quick succession was sure to do them in for good.Roy was in a chipper mood, whistling along to the Katy Perry song playing on the radio.Following their heartfelt discussion, he appeared lighthearted  almost happy.Maggie couldnt remember the last time shed seen her husband behaving this carefree.It was as though he didnt have a concern in the world.The same couldnt be said for Maggie.It felt as if her arms and legs were weighted down in concrete.Doubt and dread made it nearly impossible to breathe.She was in a panic, her heart racing, her stomach pitching.She had to know before she went crazy.Honey, would you mind looking for a drugstore?she asked, as evenly as she could manage.I left the antacids we got yesterday at the inn.His concern was immediate.Is it your stomach again?Yes, its a bit queasy.But not for the reasons he assumed.She pressed her hand to her abdomen.I hope youre not coming down with a flu bug.If you want to go back to the inn, just let me know.No, no, Im looking forward to being in Seattle.At least if she was busy she might be able to take her mind off the potential nightmare she could be facing.Riding the ferry will be awesome, he said, sounding almost boyish in his enthusiasm.It will be fun, she agreed.Shed always enjoyed a trip on the ferry.It was so picturesque, especially now that the sun was out.The weather couldnt be any more perfect.I think I see a drugstore on the next corner, Roy said.Good.Roy made the turn into the parking lot.Even before he found a parking space or turned off the engine, Maggie had released her seat belt.Ill run in and be back in a jiffy.I can go if you like, he offered.Thanks, but its no trouble.She didnt need the antacidsshe wanted a pregnancy test.She had to find out, and soon, or shed go insane.Roy couldnt know the real reason she needed to stop at a drugstore.She was halfway to the store when her husband rolled down his window and called after her, Pick up a couple bottles of water, if you would.Will do.Once inside, it took her a moment to find the right aisle for the pregnancy test kits.She grabbed one and two plastic bottles of water, and in her rush nearly forgot the antacids.All in all, it took her less than five minutes.Before she joined her husband she hid the pregnancy test kit in her oversized purse.They arrived in Bremerton with time to spare before the ferry arrived.Roy paid the fee and they joined the long queue of cars waiting for the next boat.Within a matter of minutes they were able to view the ferry turning into the cove.An eagle soared above them, its wings outstretched, making a lazy circle in the cloud dappled sky.Roy saw it first, which was no surprise, seeing how distracted she was.Do you see it?Roy asked, pointing toward the horizon.Maggie looked up and shaded her eyes, spotting the birds white head, which was a sure indication.That and the massive wingspan.A few crows chased after the eagle, but they didnt have a chance of catching the bigger bird.Ive never understood why theyre named bald eagles when they have a full head of white hair, Roy said.Me neither.Wow, look at this, her husband whispered, as he made a sweeping gesture with his arm over the blue green water.It doesnt get any more beautiful than that, does it?The scenery was spectacular, but Maggie was unable to appreciate the splendor of the view.She couldnt begin to imagine what a pregnancy would mean to the newly established commitment Roy and she had made to their marriage.Nor could she bear the thought of what Roy would do when she was forced to tell him there was a baby.She couldnt know if the father of this childif there was a childwas the result of her one night of infidelity or if it could possibly be Roys.Keeping the pregnancy a secret would be impossible for long.Roy was bound to guess  Oh goodness, she was jumping ahead of herself.She didnt have proof positive yet, but in her heart  in her heart, she knew.What astonished Maggie was that she hadnt thought of the possibility earlier.She knew the risk  with their infrequent lovemaking, shed gotten lax about taking her birth control pills.She wasnt opposed to having a third child.At one point shed discussed adding to their family with Roy.A baby.What in the name of heaven was she going to do?With the boys, each time shed been thrilled and excited.Roy, too.The joyful anticipation hed felt had spilled over in the most loving and tender of ways.Maggie recalled when they learned she was pregnant with Jaxon, their older son.Her husband had wrapped his arms around her and lifted her off her feet, swinging her around and around, all the while laughing.The joy in him was palpable.Roy couldnt wait to tell his parents and sister.Jaxon was the first grandchild, and Roys parents had been as excited as Roy and Maggie themselves.A short fifteen months after the birth of their first son, Maggie discovered she was pregnant with Collin.This second pregnancy wasnt planned, but that didnt diminish her husbands pleasure.He was just as thrilled by the news of this second child as he had been the first.Although after Collin had been born, Roy secretly admitted hed been hoping for a little girl.The ferry docked and a long line of vehicles filed off.Soon it would be their turn to board.When possible, Maggie would find a womens restroom and take the pregnancy test in with her.Once she had confirmation, she would decide when and how to tell Roy.As crazy as it sounded, she wanted to run away, or bury her head under the covers and never get out of bed again.It seemed impossible that she hadnt once, not even one time, considered the possibility of a pregnancy.How stupid could she get?Anyone who knew her would be shocked to learn of her behavior that night.Maggie had always been the obedient daughter, the perfect wife and mother.Until that night, she felt she made wise choices.Her mother would find it unbelievable that Maggie was even capable of adultery.Actually, Maggie found it hard to believe herself.After her terrible fight with Roy that night over Katherine, shed believed her marriage was over.Theyd tossed hateful words at each other, words that cut like knives, viciously stabbing at each other with insults and accusations until she felt the very lifeblood of their marriage drain away.After what shed read in his texts to the other woman and the hateful words theyd exchanged, Maggie flew out of the house.Shed been convinced there was no repairing the damage, no going back.Sobbing uncontrollably, she took off without a single idea of where she would go.She didnt want to run home to her parents.Telling them of Roys emotional affair and that she was sure they would divorce was too humiliating.It would have been natural to seek out a friend, and hindsight being what it was, she wished she had.The fact was, it was simply too embarrassing and demeaning to have to admit to anyone that her husband had been involved with another woman.When she ran a red light and narrowly escaped slamming into another car, Maggie realized she was too upset to drive.The parking spot she found was directly in front of a bar, and if ever she needed something to calm her nerves, it was then.After all, why not?Shed lost count of how many nights Roy had come home too late to eat dinner with her and the boys.Now she knew that on many of those nights hed met Katherine for an after work drink.Her husband would rather spend time with an old girlfriend than with her and their sons.Shed gone into the bar and ordered a fruity drink, tossing it back as if it was no more potent than cranberry juice.When she finished the second drink, she recognized this was her limit.No more.Already her head was spinning.Then a guy named Steve bought her another drink and had it delivered with his compliments.Shortly afterward he joined her at the table and they talked and talked.He sat next to her and he said all the things she wanted to hear from her husband but hadnt in a very long time.She was beautiful and funny.The more she drank, the wittier she got.After four drinks, Steve No last name kissed her.And Maggie let him.It was a sweet kiss, a gentle kiss, and shed nearly broken down in tears.Itd been so long since Roy had kissed her like she was the most precious gift hed ever received.The kisses felt incredibly good.After several such kisses and a few slow dances, Steve suggested they go somewhere more private.Right away Maggie knew this wasnt a good idea, but she was in no condition to drive.To her credit, she declined, and Steve was fine with it.He knew she was married, and he told her that he was as well.They were both lonely, hurting people.Steve offered to buy her a cup of coffee.There was a diner just down the street, and that sounded like the thing to do.Unfortunately, they never made it to the diner.As soon as they were out the door, Steve was kissing her again.He claimed he found he couldnt resist her.There she was up against the side of the building, making out with a man shed met only a few hours earlier, convinced her marriage was over.After a token attempt to end the foreplay, Maggie surrendered.Why not feel loved and attractive and sensual?And wanted.Roy could have Katherine.As far as Maggie was concerned, she was tired of taking second place in her husbands life.She spent the night with Steve in a hotel room and woke the next morning alone.Her head pounded with a hangover and she was sick to her stomach with what shed done.After showering and scrubbing her entire body until her skin was red, she checked her phone and saw ten text messages and voice mails from Roy.Her husband was desperate to know where she was.Hed been forced to take the boys to his sisters house.He wanted to talk.He was sorry.He needed to hear from her.Please, please call.She agreed to meet him.When they sat across from each other, Maggie was defiant and angry.Roy regretted everything.Maggie was right to be upset.He promised it was over between him and Katherine, and he vowed never to be in contact with her again.He even went so far as to sever the relationship with the company that employed her.With tears in his eyes, Roy asked Maggie to forgive him and made her promise never to leave him like that again.For most of the night hed paced the floor, worried sick about where she could be.And why in the name of heaven hadnt she answered her phone?When she woke that morning, Maggie had had no intention of ever telling her husband what shed done.But after his tearful apology, she couldnt keep it to herself.She wasnt so innocent herself, and she was sorry, too, so very sorry, and so shed blurted out everything that had happened.For the longest time Roy didnt say anything.Not a word.
