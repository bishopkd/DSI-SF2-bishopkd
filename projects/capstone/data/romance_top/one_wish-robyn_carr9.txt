You will never know how much I appreciate this, Grace said.Ill make this up to you somehow.Just go.Try to enjoy it a little even though its a heavy burden youre dealing with.Well be fine, Troy said.Im anxious to see Graces home.Come on, Gracie, relax.Iris will take good care of things.Lets goour flight leaves in a little less than two hours and we have a drive.Grace gave Iris and Ginger hugs and let herself be drawn away.Troy picked up her suitcase.Anything else?Thats it.I hope theres a little time to go into the city, he said.If you cant, I understand.He hefted the suitcase into the back of the Jeep.I love the city, he said as he got in the car.He drove out of the alley and reached for her hand.Are you really jittery?Oh, maybe a little overwhelmed at all there is to deal with.But Ill be fine once we get there.Its all good, he said.Pays to have friends like Iris.Not only is she taking care of the flower shop, shes lining up a substitute for me for Monday and Tuesday.As much as I enjoy the kids, Im looking forward to summer.And he proceeded to talk about things he hoped to do over the summer.He realized she might be pretty busy this summer, but he hoped there would be time for a couple of short camping trips along one of his favorite rivers in Idaho.He talked a little bit about some of his favorite river trips in the five state area.Although Grace nodded a lot, he could tell she was barely paying attention to him.But he thought he was doing her a service by regaling her with stories to take her mind off four days with her mother.When they got to the regional airport he looked around.Ive never flown out of here.And get thisit appears parking in this lot is free.She gave him a strange look.He pulled the suitcases out of the back and Grace took control of hers, extending the handle and pulling it.What airline is this?he asked her.Oh, Troy, she said, walking ahead.I havent prepared you for this.Im sorry.He held the door for her and they entered a small reception area banked by a counter behind which people worked on one side, offices and refreshment machines on the other.A sign pointed to the restaurant.A double door led right onto the runway.There were a few people waiting, and Winnie, Virginia and Mikhail were seated by the door.Mikhail stood up and greeted them.Good, you are here.We can go.Mikhail took Winnies left arm while Virginia took her right and they carefully guided her out the door and onto the tarmac.They passed through what appeared to be a metal detector but nothing like the usual airport security.Where are we going?Troy asked.Air Winnie, Grace said, indicating the small jet straight ahead.There were air stairs, but a uniformed man waited at the bottom with a chair like contraption for Winnie.The plane was not a little six seater: it was a private jet.Shits of the gods, Troy muttered.* * *  				Troy could not believe he was flying on a private jet.Like most people, just affording coach fares was a challenge.And when he thought about rich people, he thought they were very different, not people just like he was.Did you always travel like this?he asked Grace.No, not very often.We took a chartered jet on occasion.Now, I think my mother indulges this because of her condition.Her days of traveling are numbered.The jet was midsize, generously spaced with seating for ten, a large galley, large restroom, tables and closet space.The cabin was beautiful, the seats wide and comfortable.And Grace could tell from the glitter in Troys eyes that he was loving it.This is shit hot, he whispered to her.Hmm.He isnt put off, she thought.Well, that was a good sign.She wanted to tell Troy about the pregnancy test, but she didnt dare.Not now, not at the onset of four days with her mother.The second they had this visit behind them, the moment they had some time alone that wouldnt be interrupted by her mothers needs, she would tell him.But the last thing she wanted was for Winnie to find out before she settled things with Troy.She had to know how he wanted to deal with this situation.What if he didnt want it?What if he didnt want her anymore?What if everything collapsed because she had screwed up the plan?The captain came into the cabin and introduced himself to Winnie, saying a brisk hello to the others.Were ready if you are, he said.By all means, Winnie said.Our flight time should be just slightly over an hour, he told her.If you need anything at all, press your call button.Thank you, she said.Once they were airborne, Winnie and Virginia had a little meeting.Virginia had her notebook out and made a list from Winnies comments.There were many details.Alex, Winnies driver, had left them at the airport and was driving the car back to San Francisco.A car service had been arranged to pick them up when they landed.Dinner at the house was being prepared and the guest rooms were freshened.There were people Winnie wanted called, household maintenance she wanted done, bills paid.Mikhail pulled out a deck of cards and started playing solitaire.And before long Winnie stopped dictating and nodded off.Are you all right?Troy asked her.Sure.Fine.I just have very mixed feelings about going home.A part of me wants to see the place once more but...She shook her head.A part of me is afraid I wont be able to leave.Because you love it?No, because Ill be trapped somehow.Dont be irrational, Gracie.You can do what you want.Thats always been hard, she said.Doing what I want instead of what my mother wants.Yes, but now youve had some practice.Just over two hours later a black Cadillac SUV was passing through the iron gates into a Nob Hill neighborhood filled with large old houses fronted by manicured lawns and beautiful landscaping.Their driver pulled into a circular drive and right up to the front entrance of a rich looking manor house.The driver parked and raced around to help Winnie get out.He was quickly replaced by Virginia on one arm and Mikhail on the other while Troy assisted the driver with the luggage.If youll help me get it inside, I can manage it from there, Troy said.Be happy to, sir.When he passed through the big double doors Troy found himself not in a house but in an impressive courtyard with durable outdoor furniture scattered around, an outdoor sofa and two overstuffed chairs in front of a beautiful hearth.There were two sets of tables and chairs, vines climbing along the walls, small trees, flower beds lining the courtyard, hanging and standing pots filled with plants and a couple of decorative statues.He brought a couple of suitcases into the courtyard, Grace brought his and her own inside, the driver assisted him with the rest, most of which must have belonged to Winnie.She traveled well, but she didnt travel light.This is fine, Troy said.I can get it from here.Thank you, sir.He walked with Grace through the next door, into the house, and he stopped inside the massive foyer with marble mosaic floor, wide curving staircase and huge formal sitting room opposite the staircase.He looked around in awe.Winnie was four steps up the stairs, grasping the rail on one side, Virginia on the other, Mikhail close behind her.Then she stumbled back a step and Mikhail steadied her.Troy gasped and whispered, Jesus.He left the suitcases where they sat and went to them.Winnie, here, he said, brushing Virginia out of the way.Lets do this, its safer.He swept her up in his arms and told Virginia to lead the way.Leave those bags, Gracie.Ill come back for them.But she followed him, pulling her own bag up the stairs.It made her so proud, the way he stepped up to the plate and carried Winnie to her bedroom.He asked her where shed like him to put her down and she pointed to the chair beside the veranda.He even bent over and moved the footstool for her feet.Thank you, dear boy, she said.He glanced around the room briefly, and his eyes settled on the big four poster bed.Winnie, youre not going to be able to get in and out of that bed by yourself.Dont worry, Ill stay in the adjoining room, Virginia said.Ill be able to help her.It was where I stayed when my husband was ill, Winnie said.Grace?she called, looking past Troy to where Grace stood in the doorway.Grace, Im so tired.I might have to miss dinner.I hope you wont be offended.Of course not.Let me put my suitcase away and Ill come and help you undress and get into bed.Virginia can help me  				Let me, Mama.Ill be right back.Troy, let me show you where were going to be.Ill bring up your luggage, Winnie, he said.Itll just be a couple of minutes.Grace led the way down the hall to the room that was hers when she lived in this house.She was a little surprisednot a thing had been changed.It looked the same as the day she left.Out of curiosity she opened the walk in closet and everything was there.Shed even left a comb and brush on the dressing table in the attached bathroom.She hadnt exactly expected Winnie to turn it into a sewing room or anything, but this was almost a shrine.There was a special case for her trophies, medals and ribbons.And there were many.Will you be comfortable in here with me?she asked Troy.Will it upset your mother?he asked.Us sharing a bed?I hope not, because I cant have it any other way.Seriously?I think she knows Im no longer a child.Shes not a prude.If youre sure...She left her suitcase standing by the closet door.Im sure.Im going to go help her get comfortable and into that bed.Thanks for offering to bring up her bags.Then you can poke around.I might get lost.Grace, Ive never seen anything like this in my life.At least not since I toured Hearst Castle.Come on, its not that big.I think its under ten thousand square feet.Right.Four houses.I should take a whistle in case I need to be rescued.Dont tease me about it, okay?I know its a lot of house.I can see how something this big can be overpowering, he said, looking around her bedroom.I think its hilarious that you live in that little loft.And love it, she said.She got up on her toes and kissed his cheek.Thanks for carrying Winnie up the stairs.That was very gallant.I saw a broken hip in her future if I didnt.Ill go get her luggage.When the driver is here, he handles things like that.But he probably hasnt even hit Eureka yet.Well, youve got me.Maybe Ill come in handy.* * *  				Grace and Troy had their dinner in the kitchen.A caterer delivered and served gumbo, linguini, bread, tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella.Virginia took Winnie a tray and Mikhail joined her, leaving Troy and Grace alone.They ate in silence while the caterer closed up containers and left them on the work island in the big kitchen to be placed in the refrigerator after theyd cooled.When she left, Grace put down her spoon.This place isnt going to work for my mother, she said.I admit, I was being a little selfish when I said we should find her a place near Thunder PointI didnt want to leave my shop, you, my friends...I knew this house was too big, the furniture and stairs difficult for an invalid, but until now I didnt realize how right I was.This isnt a good place for her now.She shook her head.If she doesnt fall getting in or out of that bed...You cant leave her here without nursing help, Troy said.I wont.Virginia knows everyone.Shes like a personal concierge.Thats part of her job, knowing where to look, who to call.Tell me what youd like me to do while Im here, he said.I dont know.Ill spend tomorrow with Virginia and my mother.We have to pull together a plan.I better call Ray Anne and see if shes making progress.This is more urgent than I realized.Gracie, this is all going to be yours, he said.What are you going to do with it?Im going to figure that out.And then Im going home, where theres a life thats not bigger than life.Really, I dont know how you can leave this.Do you want it, Troy?All this house, all the upkeep, maintenance, work?All the space?All the responsibility?All the people?I dont think so, he said.But, Gracie, its damned intimidating.In what way?she asked.He was quiet for a second.If you have all this, what more could you possibly need?What could I ever give you that you dont already have ten of?Do you really have to ask?* * *  				Grace had to take on a house shed never known, not really.It had never been her burden to make sure it was cared for or staffedthat had been something women like Winnie were bred and raised to do.And Winnie was dying.No matter how much Winnie might want to be in charge, it was no longer practical.Virginia called Winnies neurologist, the man who initially diagnosed her almost four years earlier.Dr.Halstead came to the house in the late afternoon the very next day.Grace understood that house calls were not typical for him, but hed known Winnie long before she needed his medical expertisethey had served together on several charity boards over the years.He confirmed that Winnie had hobbled along with her disease for longer than was typical; now it was a matter of finding a team who could help manage her quality of life.When asked how long that life might last, his prognosis wasnt positive.It could be as short as a few months, as long as a year but more likely something in between.Now it was down to staying comfortable and taking advantage of her mental acuity, which would probably be the last to fail.I live up the coast in a very small quiet town, Grace told him.I have someone looking for a place for Mother so I can be on hand, where I can see her every day.I dont want her to have to go to a hospital.Thats the best way.Most end stage ALS patients require a great deal of support, but theres no way to reverse the disease.The first order of business was moving a smaller bed into Winnies room.Virginia contacted a home health care service and since Winnie didnt go through insurance or require approval, she arranged to pay top dollar for a couple of experienced nurses aides who would start helping out immediately, taking the burden of her personal care off Grace and Virginia.And Mikhail.Youre still here, Grace observed.When do you plan to return to your team?I think, much later.Theyre in good hands.If they choose other coach, so be it.Im taking her to Thunder Point as soon as I can, she reminded him.Thunder Point, he said with a shrug.Not so bad.Are you planning to stay with her, then?I have nothing so important right now.He was the perfect distraction for Winnie.He wasnt ready to retire, but he wasnt a young man at sixty six.I had no idea Mother meant so much to you, she said.All the years you coached me, you ran interference between Mother and me.Youre the one that kept me working and her in line.I didnt know you loved her.Love?Not the love you know, pupsik.We understand each other.It could be my life closing, not hers.She would not turn me out.Is family.There should be one person who doesnt hate me on the other side.Im not long behind her.But he was long behind herhe was strong, his health good, and this was a sacrifice for him.He was in demand as a coach, his business was still thriving.She knew he would be missed.She also knew that he could stay a few weeks and go back to his team, currently managed by coaching assistants, and pick up right where he left off.Im glad youre staying awhile.Dont get underfoot, now.Maybe teach Troy poker or something.There was a housekeeper who came in weekdays from eight to five.She was fifty five, of German descentthe woman who had replaced Mamie.She wasnt as warm and motherly as Mamie, but that mightve had more to do with the fact that they didnt really know each other.She seemed to have a wonderful rapport with Virginia, who was younger by only a few years.Gretchen didnt do much housework and only a little cooking.She was the manager of a big houseshe hired and supervised a cleaning service, ordered groceries to be delivered and called local restaurants to bring in meals customized to Winnies needs.Virginia and Grace met with her in the kitchen and Gretchen was more than happy to stay on after Winnie was moved.After all, it was great pay for far less work.Meeting her mothers two lawyers was emotionally exhausting, but not because it was hard work.Just as Grace had suspected, Winnie had been prepared.Shed known for years that this was coming.Everything in the house had been cataloged, photographed and appraised, including jewelry.As for Winnies accounts and net worth, it had all been managed and auditedafter all, the money was old.It wasnt as though it was a new job.Grace met briefly with a Realtor.She wouldnt make a commitment and even suggested she wasnt sure what she would do with this property, but she knew exactly what would happen.Whispered feelers would go out and when the time came to sell, there would be an auction.The house was a prime property.It was all so huge to her.Even flying first class, going to skate practices in a chauffeured car and owning her own business hadnt really prepared her for the magnitude of her imminent inheritance.But as Grace began to understand the full weight of it, she felt Winnies stress.It had been a lifes work.Please dont worry, she told her mother.I wont let it be abused, stolen or ignored.I promise.But what will you do with it?Winnie asked.Just as you did, Mama.Ill take very good care of it.And the house and all these possessions?she asked.I want you to be at peace about that.Its all being guarded and cared for.And later, when you dont need it anymore, Ill go through it, claim those things that have sentimental value to both of us and then...Then there will be an estate sale managed by the company you suggested.If it will give you peace of mind, I can meet with them before I go home.Grace, do you have to go home?I have to get a place ready for us, she said.She wanted enough space so that when necessary she could stay the night with her mother, but she wasnt planning to live in the house with her.Youll need money.Virginia has some banking cards for you to sign for your checking account.And when you find that house, I want my bedroom rug, the Aubusson.And the antique dressing table.And the china.Not the expensive china, the Audun Fleur.And theres silver that was my mothersif you dont want to use it, I understand, but if theres a granddaughter someday...Grace touched her hand.I might not use some of my grandmothers and great grandmothers treasures, but I promise to keep them in case...There could be daughters one day.Wouldnt it be wonderful if there were daughters for you?she said.You will do so much better with them than I did.I hope there are daughters and I hope I can love them as much, she said, even though for so many years she had found fault with her mothers form of affection.We got to the top, Izzy, she said.Yes, Mother.Thank you for all you did.No, Izzy.Thank you for doing it for me.Grace never thought shed hear that!We were a good team when it came to winning, she said.She made a vow.When she had children, she wasnt going to put the burden of her desires on them.Every day exhausted her.She would see Troy on and off through the days.He poked around the house and neighborhood, went down to the wharf a couple of times and kept himself busy.He made friends with the maintenance men, pestered Gretchen in the kitchen, got lost in the library and spent some time on his laptop.Shed have dinner with him in the kitchen, fall into bed with him at night and sometimes she cried.She was losing the mother she had always loved, tried so hard to please and never really known.Finally Tuesday came and it was time to go back to Thunder Point.She was so relieved, but frantic at the leaving.Virginia would stay, help get her mother to Thunder Point when the time came.Mikhail was planning on coming to Thunder Point, as well.Then Virginia would return to San Francisco.The housekeeper would remain to keep the house in order and in good repair until it was time to close it up.All the account information and household data was uploaded to accessible accounts so they were easy for Grace to oversee.She could call the accounting firm or lawyers whenever there was a question or request.The neighborhood and the house had private security; the contents had been inventoried, and her mother was in good hands with Virginia running herd on her health care providers.The plane that Virginia arranged for Troy and Grace wasnt a large plush jet, but rather a small Lear that returned them to Thunder Point in no time at all.Grace wanted to tell him about the baby.Funny, in her mind it had gone from a positive pregnancy test to a baby.Oh, she was falling in love with the baby already.But she was so tired after four days of getting things settled, she just fell asleep on the plane.They had a quick bite to eat on the way home from the airport then Troy helped her get her suitcase up to her little apartment.I have to go home, babe, he said.I need to get ready for work in the morning.You going to be all right?Ill be fine, she said.Thank you for coming with me.Thank you for everything you did.I didnt do much.You handled it all.Ill talk to you after work tomorrow.Nineteen  				Troy couldnt count the number of times Grace had said You dont understand when she was telling him about her childhood, her life as a competitive figure skater, her parents.Likewise, he couldnt imagine how many times he had replied, Of course I do, Grace.Now, he realized, he really hadnt.Grace had come from a world so alien to him he wondered if he would ever understand it.Troy had never been around people with the kind of money it took to rent a jet or live in a mansion with a complete staff to take care of it.But of course there had to be a staffno one could take care of something that big alone.The closest hed ever come to that kind of wealth was knowing a guy who had a cousin who was a pro football player and bought himself a three million dollar house and a fast car.He couldnt even remember what kind of car because of course hed never seen it.Troy didnt even read about rich people.He read about rafting, climbing, diving.He was scrimping to make his Jeep payments.Grace could probably pay it off out of her allowance.Did Grace get an allowance?He left Grace at her place and went home to his apartment, which was very quiet.It was also very lonely.He had only rarely spent a night alone since he started sleeping with Grace and he wasnt thrilled about being alone tonight, either.Troy had never lived with a woman and he still didnt, not officially at any rate.He and Grace each had their own place.Except he checked in with Grace at least three times a day and saw her when they were both off work.And stayed the night more often than not.But right now he needed a little space and time to think.He thought he knew her inside and out, but after four days in San Francisco he wondered if he knew her at all.He was more than a little intimidated by the magnitude of her wealth.It made him feel like a failure by comparison.Intellectually he knew that wasnt the case, but somewhere inside, he had that sinking feeling of not being good enough.The next day, during his free period, he went looking for Iris, whom he considered his closest friend.She was a counselor and he needed counseling.There was a part of him that hoped shed be busy with a student, because he wasnt sure how he was going to put into words what he was thinking.Got a minute?he asked, standing in her doorway.Sure, she said with a smile.Want to sit?Thanks, he said, sitting in front of her desk.But then he didnt say anything.Troy?Problems with a student?He shook his head.Listen, I dont know how to say this, how to explain this, so if I sound like an idiot...Just spit it out.We can rake through the idiocy afterward.Can this be confidential?he asked.Of course!Its about Grace.Weve gotten pretty close.Iris smiled.You two seem great together.You know were not alike, right?She made a doubtful face.You seem a lot alike.You laugh at the same things, you appear to be inseparable, shes an athlete and youre a pretty physical guy.I bet you finally found someone to play with.But we come from completely different backgrounds.Completely.Did you know Grace is He struggled.Shes well to do.Iris leaned back.I heard that.I mean, she told me.It was pretty recently, when she was telling me about growing up on the ice skating circuit.She said she had tutors and traveled the world to compete and I asked how expensive things like skating lessons were.Lessons for kids can be as much as ninety dollars an hour but coaching for world champions?It can be any amount, depending on the coach, maybe four hundred a day!Plus expenses.So I asked...Her mother is rich, he said.Old money.Apparently theres a difference, he added.She didnt make it on a dot com, Iris said with a grin.I assume theres enough so that it keeps growing itself.Not only was Grace born into it, apparently her mother was, as was her grandmother.It might be billions, Troy said.Billions?Come on!I dont know.How would I know?But heres what I know after spending a few days at her childhood home.The house is bigger than four normal houses, and it takes a full staff to run it so just one person can live in it.Theres a full time driver, even if hes not driving much.I think her mother might have other housesshe likes to spend time in Cabo, in New York, in London.Theres art and jewelry and her mother can rent private jets anytime she wants to.I mean, she stinks with it.Im serious.Wow.Incredible.Sounds like the Gettys.You should look and see if theyre on the Forbes List.Im afraid to, Troy said.Why?she asked with a laugh.Shell still be your friend.Iris, weve been more than friends.And I cant relate to that kind of money.Just as well, she said, laughing.Its not yours.Its hers.Iris, could you please stop laughing.It makes me feel like a poor relation with his hand out.You have your hand out?Of course not!But thats how I feel!Do you know anyone that rich?Im not sure, she said.Peyton comes from a pretty rich family.She does?he asked, shocked.Uh huh.Her parents own one of the biggest farms in Oregon.Huge.They grow pears for Harry & David, potatoes for grocers, have a ton of sheep for the wool and now she says her father and brothers are into Christmas trees.Scott says its a huge family, almost all of them in the business, and her father has holes in his jeans and drives an old pickup with no shocks.He probably doesnt have a twenty in his pocket, but his net worth is astronomical.I didnt know that, he said.Do they live in a big house?Yes.With one bathroom.Eight kids, one bathroom.Try to imagine.Okay, were not talking about the same thing at all.Grace has money to burn.I think if she started spending it now she couldnt go through it all.Unfortunately for her mother, its in Graces near future.Iris sat back in her chair and chewed on her pen.Troy, what about this is a problem?He shrugged and looked down.Spit it out before I start guessing.I dont feel good enough.Ridiculous, she scoffed.Your individual incomes have nothing at all to do with your worth.After all, Grace didnt earn hers, did she?She was born to itthats nothing but luck.You should start playing the lottery, maybe youll get lucky.Tell me how to get past this, he said.My brain is telling me it makes no sense to feel this way and I dont know why I cant shake it.Im a smart person.I dont discriminate against anyone.What the hell is this?I think its testosterone, she said.Really!she said, her tone indicating some disgust.Whered you come up with that?It sounds like just another version of lets get em out and measure em, boys.Men have this competitive thing, this need for mastery.You have a hard time if you think youre not in control, especially in control of your woman.Something about Graces family money makes you feel vulnerable and awkward.And yet the girl lives in a tiny loft!She drives a flower delivery van!Ive never been like that, he said.Ive never been controlling toward women.If you knew my mother or sister, you wouldnt even suggest that.Then what is it?she asked.I dont know.Its just...I wonder what I could ever get her if she has everything.What can I do for her if she can pick up the phone and hire it done?Iris stared at him in wonder.She leaned toward him and her voice was disarmingly soft.Troy, I want you to think about those questionswhat could you give her, what could you do for her?When you come up with the answers, you will have solved the problem.Im not going to be able to answer for you.But can I just tell you one thing?Please.The important things Seth gives me never come out of his pocket.* * *  				Grace didnt sleep as well without Troy as she had with him, but after all hed done for her the past week, shed never complain.She was up early, not because she was ambitious but because she didnt want to struggle again and again to fall back to sleep.The look it left on her was less than gorgeous.After the past week, including her four days in San Francisco, she had dark circles under her eyes.She used a little cosmetic concealer and hoped she wouldnt yawn all day.She got into the shop early and found it was as clean as an ICU, her flowers all well cared for and chilling, her desk clear and the front of the store sparkling.Even the scarred, stained worktable had been scrubbed and if she wasnt mistaken, the floor had been thoroughly mopped, something she didnt bother with more than once a week.That workroom saw a lot of action and keeping it pristine was a never ending task.Ginger wasnt due until nine but she came in at eight, using her own key.She was clearly surprised to see Grace and her face lit up with a happy smile.Welcome home!How was the trip?Productive, she said.And very tiring.Im going to want to speak to Ray Anne at her earliest convenience.Is she awake?Awake, already left the house and said to tell you shes planning to come down to talk with you today, probably before noon.Outstanding, Grace said.The place looks great, Ginger.It looks like you were scrubbing all night.No, not at all.There wasnt much business.I only tried my hand at one arrangement, which didnt turn out too well, then I stopped.I didnt want to waste flowers on practice.Well, we get a new shipment tomorrow and since theyre mostly for the wedding, Ill order yet another for Monday.Later today you can feel free to practice.Flowers that have reached their life expectancy have to be disposed of anyway.It must kill you to throw away flowers, Ginger said.It kills me more to get a phone call from a customer saying their centerpiece lasted two days!Fresh is beautiful, remember that.Can I make you some coffee?Ginger asked, going to the workroom.Grace thought about it, then lied.Ive already had coffee, thanks.Go ahead, make yourself a pot.The minute we have time, Ill show you how to use the designing computer programs I have.While they were in San Francisco, Grace had stayed away from wine and caffeine, though she could have used a full tank of each.Shed let Troy pour her a glass of wine, then nurse it.Shed take a sip and complain of being too tired to enjoy it and once she tipped it into a potted plant when he wasnt looking.She poured coffee down the drain.No one seemed to notice.She wasnt sure Troy would question it but since she wasnt ready to confront it, she kept silent.Tonight, however.Tonight it had to be done.She was afraid, of course.She hoped he wouldnt suggest they terminate to give themselves more time, because in the days since shed peed on the stick shed been seeing a real, beautiful baby in her mind.Now there was no direction for her other than to have it, to hold it and love it.It was late morning when Ray Anne came into the shop.Im so glad youre here, Grace said.Im afraid I have to do everything I can to find a place for my mother and quickly.I knew that old house in the Bay Area wasnt going to work for hereverything is a challenge, from the bed to the stairs to the bath.We practically have to have her doctor flown in and shes pretty much captive in that bedroom with no fresh air or  				Ray Anne was smiling.Weve got the solution.Everything you need, everything you asked for.Really?Howd you find it?Id love to take credit, but Cooper will rat me out eventually.He has three spec houses that can be occupied in three months or less and hes given me the contracts.Her face fell.Ray Anne, we dont have three months.Not to worry.The exteriors are nearly finished on all three and one of them only needs a little...Oh, listen, come with me, come and see.Ginger can stay here, cant she?She sure can, Grace said.She left the place better than I leave it!Grace jumped in Ray Annes car and they drove along the beach by the high road that wound behind the houses right down to Coopers bar.Stairs led from the bar and houses down to the beach, the structures being safely perched on the hill.Ray Anne parked in the drive of the house nearest Coopers, next door to Spencer and Devon Lawsons home.There were a lot of trucks and construction equipment everywhere and Grace was immediately disappointed.These houses look far from ready, she said.And, Ray Anne, theyre three levels!Stairs!Oh, theyre not completely ready, but Coopers hoping to get contracts on them before the interior is finished so new owners can choose their flooring, paint, appliances, decorator items like wallpaper.Come inside, youll see.She led the way and held the door open.They stepped into a wide foyer that opened right to a large living room and dining room.Very large.Twenty by twenty, Ray Anne confirmed.Behind the great room was a nice sized kitchen with plenty of cupboard space, once the cupboards were installed, that is.A breakfast bar divided it from the dining room and there was an island with a small sink.Straight ahead, a triple sliding door led to a wide deck.There was a fireplace on one wall, mantel unfinished.There were no countertops or appliances; the floors were plywood and still littered with construction trash.To the right of the kitchen were matching up and down staircases with crude railings in want of the finished decorator banisters.There was a door into the kitchen from the garage.This way, Ray Anne said.She walked to the left down a wide hall.The master bedroom was in front, beach side, with a large en suite bath.French doors led onto the deck.A second bedroom was across the hall.There was a generous bathroom down the hall for the use of anyone on that floor.Now listen, Ray Anne said.What do you hear?Hammers and saws, Grace said, again disappointed.But not as loud.And I have a solution for that.But consider this.We can get the flooring, appliances and bathroom fixtures in very quickly.Countertops would have to be rushed.You have your choice of cupboardsonce you make up your mind about the wood type.Theyre constructed off site and installed in a day.Paint on this level would take two days.Ray Anne, its not finished!Its noisy!My mother isnt well!Your mother is quickly becoming wheelchair bound but shes not feeling ill or in painisnt that what you told me?And there wont be any more noise in this property once we get this level finished.And as far as the neighboring houses are concernedonce the exteriors are finished, all the construction noise will be indoors.A good pair of soft noise canceling headphones can solve that problem easily.Come back this way.Ray Anne clacked down the hall to the great room in her heels.She stood in the center of the room.The slab is poured and doors and windows installed on the lower level.The walls for two bedrooms, game room and large bathroom arent finished, but its closed up, airtight.There are two rooms and a small bath in the loft.The bedrooms have ocean views.The garage has unfinished walls but its completely functional.Now use your imagination...And with that, Ray Anne closed her eyes as if dreaming.Im trying, Grace said.Ive got to get my mother out of that San Francisco house soon, before she goes stir crazy in that big old bedroom of hers.Before she breaks a hip falling down the three stairs into the bathroom or slips trying to get into the pedestal tub...Grace, if we concentrate on this floor and leave the lower floor and loft until last, we can get you in here in a month at the very longest, but I bet I can do better, lots better, if it doesnt take you long to make your decorating selections.I recommend hardwood floors, shutters for the ocean side doors and windowsthat setting sun can be brutal.I can place all the orders and call in favorspeople all over Coos County owe me.And once they start, I know how to motivate.That gives you a finished main level with access to the bath, kitchen, two bedrooms, great room and deck.The other two levels can be left until...She swallowed and cleared her throat.Until its more practical.Devon and Spence moved in when all they had finished was this level.Spencer worked over the summer and finished the lower floor and loft himself to save money.Grace was beginning to see it in her mind.Shed been in Coopers house once when she delivered Mothers Day flowers for Sarah and it was spacious and beautiful.The deck with the fireplace was to die for.She pointed to the deck.Awning and fireplace?Anything you want.The awning and some comfortable outdoor deck furniture is easy, the fireplace much more complicated, but youre not going to crave an outdoor fireplace for six months.At least.Anytime she heard six months, it caused her eyes to water, but shed been very emotional lately.Her mother could be gone in six months.Then again, she could live another year.She could live long enough to meet her grandchild.Youre close to town.Youre close to Dr.Grant and Peyton if you need medical attention for your mother.Yes, she said.There was that second bedroom for health care workers who stayed full time.Washer and dryer?she asked.In the hall, Ray Anne said, pointing to the two spaces.Washer and dryer on one side, linen closet on the other.No laundry room, Im afraid.There is room for one downstairs if a laundry room with a sink is important, but there are a lot of stairs involved in that idea.Grace walked back down the hall.The master had two walk in closets and it was, in itself, a spacious room.The bathroom, very roomy.Could we put a glass block wall in here for the shower?No sliding glass door?I think so!Ray Anne said.Not only handicap accessible but very up to date decor!Grace looked at her.All right, how much?Brace yourself, Ray Anne said.Its oceanfront, even though its a good twenty feet above the beach.One point two.That wasnt thousands, Grace knew that.Cooper said because its you, hed rent it to you for up to a year, but the rent would be pricey, too.How in the world does Spencer do it on a coachs salary?Im sure he got a great deal.He and Cooper share a son and it was important to everyone that Austin live close to them both.You said not to worry about the money.I know its a lot, but for what you want...I know.I want my mother to be comfortable and near beauty.And near me, and my shop is walking distance.But I need that loft finished as soon as possiblehow complicated is that?Well, there are only floors and paint needed up there, no cupboards or countertops, so that should be quick.But youre going to have to add light fixtures.Light fixtures are simple if it doesnt take you six weeks to decide what you want.Even I know how to install light fixtures.Is that fireplace ready?Except for the glass and ceramic logsaccessories.But you wont be cold for...Just thinking about what has to be done to make it ready.Take a little time to think about it, Grace.But dont think long if you want to get started.You wont be able to close on it for about thirty days if all goes well, but this is Coopers property and, given your circumstances, hes willing to start the interior work and even let you in before closing.He didnt ask for a contract for that, but I will.I want him protected in case you change your mind or...She blinked and made a face.Or in case something unexpected happens and you dont need the house anymore.In case she dies before I get her here?Well, thats not going to happenshes in pretty good shape for the shape shes in.And we have to move ahead before she gets worse.Where do I have to go to make selections?You want it?Lets do it.Will twenty percent down for a cash sale convince Cooper to take a chance on me?I believe so, Ray Anne said, smiling.Even better, itll convince him he made the right choice giving me the listings.She laughed merrily.I can get this in shape for you, kiddo.You wont believe how good I am at that.If Ginger can watch the shop, I can take you to a couple of places.You should choose countertops, appliances and flooring first.Cupboards and banisters should be next.I can bring you catalogs for fixtures, blinds, shades and shutters, ceramic logs and paint.Given the openness here, youre going to want to match your cabinetry with floors and banisters.She stuck out her hand.Lets shake on it and go over to Coopers bar and sign papers.* * *  				Grace had to call Ginger and ask her if she felt confident enough to manage the shop another day and, bless her, she was good with that.She then spent four hours with Ray Anne, first signing the contracts for the house and then heading to Bandon and North Bend to make decorating selections.She didnt screw around pondering her choices, but Ray Anne enthusiastically endorsed every one.About two hours into the project, Grace suddenly felt very faint and woozy with a touch of nausea.Oh, damn, I forgot to eat, she said to her Realtor.I have an energy drink in my purse, Ray Anne offered.Oh, so thats what keeps you going, she joked, but a bit weakly.She used to live on those!But with a bun in the oven, she wasnt sure what was safe.Pull into the next grocery or deli.All I need is a half sandwich or something and Ill be fine.But it reminded her that she had other important business at hand.She was just getting back to the flower shop a little after three when she finally texted Troy.Am I going to see you tonight?He texted back that he was working at Coopers from four till whenever and if she wanted him to, he could stop by afterward.If I want you to?It was usually hard to keep him away.Please, she responded.I really have to talk to you about a couple of things.From that point until nine thirty she wondered what she was going to say.How she was going to say it.When he finally arrived and used his own key to get in, she leaped to her feet and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.Even twenty four hours away from him was too much.But he didnt embrace her as wildly.His hands rested on her hips.This was where Troy usually wondered how fast he could get into her.Counter, table, floor, wall?And yet there was a sudden distance she couldnt understand.Why are you different?she asked.Different how?I dont know, she said.Theres something different.Youre not clutching me.Youre not trying to get under my clothes.Its like you dont want to be here!No, no, I want to be here.Gracie, we should talk about a few things.Yes, she said, drawing him into her little space.Yes, we have to talk.You first.Whats bothering you?They sat on the couch together.He held her hands.He gazed into her eyesall the gestures of impending bad news.Grace, Im not proud of this, okay.I have to be honest with you.The money.Your money.It was ten times greater than I imagined.A hundred times greater.It kind of blew me away.Intimidated me.Filled me with doubts.Doubts?About us, Gracie.I dont feel like we have as much in common as I thought we did.It worries me a little.Im wondering...what do we do if we find out we dont fit?If were just too different?She was stunned.Are you breaking up with me?she asked.No.No, of course not.Im just a little...Im worried about us.I need time to figure out how we go forward together.I dont have anything, Grace.Youre as rich as the Gettys.I dont want to live off you.You cant live off me.We have to figure this out.Oh, for pitys sake, she said.Do I look like Im rich?she said, throwing an arm wide, indicating her little loft.I have an ideahow about if I earn a living, you earn a living and neither of us lives off the other?And that fortune youre sitting on?Ill do exactly as I promised my motherIll take care of it.Troy, Im not going to live in a big cold stone manor house with a full time staff.I do need more space than this someday, but...I bought my mother a house today.On the beach.One of Coopers new houses.Something that would be perfect for herthe warm sun on the deck, the sound of the ocean.I think it could be comforting for her, much more so than the big house in the city.And I  				See?See?That was just so easy.You just went out and bought a house that must have cost, I dont know, a million dollars or  				One point two, she said, lifting her chin a notch.Holy Jesus...He leaned an elbow on his knee and put his head in his hand.Close to my shop, close to the doctor, close to the sound of kids having fun, dogs barking as they play fetch or chase birds along the beach, nice neighbors...Do you have any idea how weird that is?That you can just plunk down over a million dollars and  				So much for You dont have to be afraid to tell me anything, Grace, and You dont have to worry about how Ill react, Grace.Its who I am!she shouted.Im sorry I couldnt be broke and up to my eyeballs in student loans for you, but this is who I am and Im not a bad person!I never meant to suggest you were  				And Im pregnant!All sound and motion stopped.She could tell that Troy didnt breathe.He just held his breath and looked at her.Finally he said, Whoa.And that was all.After actual minutes had passed, he asked, How pregnant?I dont know.Not very.I thought you were going to see Peyton.I thought you were going to  				Take care of it?she asked tartly.I went to Peyton.She said I had a few days to see if my period would just come on its own so I could start on the pill.I was supposed to follow up with her.And you didnt?A few things happened!I got that note, I tried to electrocute my boyfriend, your friends came for the weekend, my mother showed up with ALS...I forgot.It just slipped my mind.When I realized my period was really late, I used a test and peed on the stick.I wanted to tell you that second, but we were literally on our way to the airport and things were complicated enough.This is the first chance weve had to talk.Oh, God, he said.You didnt remember, either!You never asked!Grace, I take responsibility and youre right, I didnt follow up, either.But lets not panic.Its early.We dont have to make any decisions tonight.We can process this.I dont have any decisions to make, Troy.I have a baby in me.Its just a little seed, but its there and Im not making it go away just because its inconvenient.Okay, fine, right.But we dont have to make any irrevocable decisions tonight.Theres time to think this through.All right.You go think this through.When you know what you want, you know where to find me.You want me to leave?Yes, she said.You have a lot of issues.Whether were right for each other, whether we have enough in common, whether the fact that I come from a family with money is going to be a problem for you, what you want to do about a baby.I have no issues.I have nothing I have to process.Okay, now youre getting mad, he said.Be fair, Gracewhat can I ever give you if you have everything?If all you have to do is point and its yours?Right, she wanted to say.The same way I bought the gold medals.Her hand slid over her flat tummy.I want you to go, she said evenly.I want you to process.When you know how you feel about me, about us, about this little seed, you let me know.Youll get more thinking done on your own.Besides, Im not lying naked in bed with someone who isnt sure.Thats too much to ask.Gracie, I love you, he said.Great.Thanks.Doesnt sound like thats going to do me much good right now.So lets take a break while you decide whether this is all too complicated for you.I have to take care of myself, my little seed, my mother, my shop.I dont have any extra energy to take care of you right now.Are you sure thats the way you want it?Im sure, she said.Twenty  				Early Thursday morning, Peyton stood in the doorway locked in a passionate kiss with Scott while her sister, Adele, waited in the car.When the kiss wouldnt stop, Adele tooted the horn.Peyton laughed against Scotts lips.Ill see you tomorrow night, she promised.And youll bring my honeymoon suitcase.And you have your wedding dress and will pick up my tux.And youll take the kids to the grandmothers.They want to stay at the farm, which is going to hurt the grandmothers feelings.Talk to them about that on your drive up, okay?Theyll get plenty of time at the farm, but they do have to visit all the grandparents and take turns and be fair.They know how to share and be fair.Ill talk to them, he promised.But I want to stay at the farm, too.With you.Starting Saturday night we will always stay together and I wont have to sleep in your mothers craft room anymore, she said.I never understood that, Scott said.She doesnt do crafts.Not really.I love you, Scott.Im going to marry you.I cant believe it.Are you sure?Im sure.Are you?I was sure the day you walked into my office.The only reason I didnt make a pass right away was because I thought you were a lesbian.Lesbian hearts are breaking all over the world and I got you.She laughed.You got me all right.My breasts are actually getting sore already.He grinned at her.Then theyre going to get big.Adele gave the horn another toot.Think Id better hit the road?she asked.Call me when you reach the farm.Ill get to my moms tomorrow.Ill help her with the grooms dinner if she needs it.Grace is bringing the centerpieces.Another quick kiss and Peyton was in the car with her sister.
