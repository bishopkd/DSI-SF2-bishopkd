What say you to that?So I get to sleep with you?In your bed?Is that what you want?Yes.I agree, then.Besides, I sleep very well when youre in my bed.I had no idea.I was frightened youd leave me if I didnt agree to all of it, she says, her face a little pale.Im not going anywhere, Anastasia.Besides How can she think that?I need to reassure her.Were following your advice, your definition: compromise.You e mailed it to me.And so far, its working for me.I love that you want more.I know.My tone is warm.How do you know?Trust me.I just do.You told me in your sleep.The waitress returns with our breakfast and I watch Ana devour it.More seems to be working for her.This is delicious, she says.I like that youre hungry.Must have been all the exercise last night and the thrill this morning.It was a thrill, wasnt it?It was mighty fine, Mr.Grey, she says as she pops the final piece of pancake into her mouth.Can I treat you?she adds.Treat me how?Pay for this meal.I snort.I dont think so.Please.I want to.Are you trying to completely emasculate me?I raise an eyebrow in warning.This is probably the only place that Ill be able to afford to pay.Anastasia, I appreciate the thought.I do.But no.She purses her lips with irritation when I ask the redhead for the check.Dont scowl, I warn, and check the time: its 8:30.I have a meeting at 11:15 with the Savannah Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, so unfortunately we have to get back to the city.I contemplate canceling the meeting, because Id like to spend the day with Ana, but no, thats too much.Im running after this girl when I should be concentrating on my business.Priorities, Grey.With her hand in mine, we head to the car looking like any other couple.Shes swamped in my sweatshirt, looking casual, relaxed, beautifuland yes, shes with me.Three guys strolling into IHOP check her out; shes oblivious even when I put my arm around her to stake my claim.She really has no idea how lovely she is.I open her car door and she gives me a sunny smile.I could get used to this.I program her mothers address into the GPS and we set off north on I 95, listening to the Foo Fighters.Anas feet tap to the beat.This is the sort of music she likesall American rock.The traffic on the freeway is heavier now, with commuters heading into the city.But I dont care: I like being here with her, spending time.Holding her hand, touching her knee, watching her smile.She tells me about previous visits to Savannah; shes not keen on the heat, either, but her eyes light up when she talks about her mother.Itll be interesting to see her interacting with her mother and stepfather this evening.I pull up outside her mothers home with some regret.I wish we could play hooky all day; the last twelve hours have beennice.More than nice, Grey.Sublime.Do you want to come in?she asks.I need to work, Anastasia, but Ill be back this evening.What time?She suggests seven, then looks from her hands to me, her eyes bright and joyful.Thank youfor the more.My pleasure, Anastasia.I lean over and kiss her, inhaling her sweet, sweet scent.Ill see you later.Try to stop me, I whisper.She climbs out of the car, still in my sweatshirt, and waves good bye.I head back to the hotel, feeling a little emptier now that shes not with me.IN MY ROOM, I call Taylor.Mr.Grey.Yeahthanks for organizing this morning.Youre most welcome, sir.He sounds surprised.Ill be ready to leave at ten forty five for the meeting.Ill have the Suburban waiting outside.Thanks.I change out of my jeans and into my suit but leave my favorite tie beside my laptop as I order up coffee from room service.I work through my e mails, drink coffee, and consider calling Ros; however, its too early for her.I read through all the paperwork that Bill has sent: Savannah does make a good case for siting the plant here.I check my inbox, and theres a new message from Ana.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Soaring as Opposed to Sore ing  Date: June 2 2011 10:20 EST  To: Christian Grey  Sometimes, you really know how to show a girl a good time.Thank you  Ana x  The title makes me laugh and the kiss makes me feel ten feet tall.I type up my response.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Soaring vs Sore ing  Date: June 2 2011 10:24 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  Ill take either of those over your snoring.I had a good time, too.But I always do when Im with you.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.Her answer is almost immediate.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: SNORING  Date: June 2 2011 10:26 EST  To: Christian Grey  I DO NOT SNORE.And if I do, its very ungallant of you to point it out.You are no gentleman, Mr.Grey!And you are in the Deep South, too!Ana  I chuckle.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Somniloquy  Date: June 2 2011 10:28 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  I have never claimed to be a gentleman, Anastasia, and I think I have demonstrated that point to you on numerous occasions.I am not intimidated by your SHOUTY capitals.But I will confess to a small white lie: noyou dont snore, but you do talk.And its fascinating.What happened to my kiss?Christian Grey  Cad & CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.This will drive her crazy.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Spill the Beans  Date: June 2 2011 10:32 EST  To: Christian Grey  You are a cad and a scoundreldefinitely no gentleman.So, what did I say?No kisses for you until you talk!Oh, this could run and run    * * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Sleeping Talking Beauty  Date: June 2 2011 10:35 EST  To: Anastasia Steele  It would be most ungallant of me to say, and I have already been chastised for that.But if you behave yourself, I may tell you this evening.I do have to go into a meeting now.Laters, baby.Christian Grey  CEO, Cad & Scoundrel, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.With a broad grin I slip on my tie, grab my jacket, and head downstairs to find Taylor.JUST OVER AN HOUR later, Im winding up my meeting with the Savannah Brownfield Redevelopment Authority.Georgia has a great deal to offer, and the team has promised GEH some serious tax incentives.Theres a knock at the door and Taylor enters the small conference room.His face looks grim, but whats more worrying is that he never, ever interrupts my meetings.My scalp prickles.Ana?Is she okay?Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, he says to all of us.Yes, Taylor, I ask, and he approaches and speaks discreetly in my ear.We have a situation at home concerning Miss Leila Williams.Leila?What the hell?And part of me is relieved that its not Ana.Would you excuse me, please?I ask the two men and two women from the SBRA.In the hallway, Taylors tone is grave as he apologizes once more for interrupting my meeting.Dont worry.Tell me whats happened.Miss Williams is in an ambulance on the way to the ER at Seattle Free Hope.Ambulance?Yes, sir.She broke into the apartment and made a suicide attempt in front of Mrs.Jones.Fuck.Suicide?Leila?In my apartment?She slashed her wrist.Gail went with her in the ambulance.Shes informed me that the EMTs arrived in time and Miss Williams is not in any immediate danger.Why Escala?Why in front of Gail?Im shocked.Taylor shakes his head.I dont know, sir.Neither does Gail.She cant get any sense out of Miss Williams.Apparently, she only wants to talk to you.Fuck.Exactly, sir, Taylor says without judgment.I scrape my hands through my hair, trying to grasp the magnitude of what Leila has done.What the hell am I supposed to do?Why did she come to me?Was she expecting to see me?Wheres her husband?Whats happened to him?Hows Gail?A little shaken.Im not surprised.I thought you should know, sir.Yes.Sure.Thanks, I mumble, distracted.I cant believe it; Leila seemed happy when she last e mailed, what, six or seven months ago.But there are no answers for me here in GeorgiaI have to go back and talk to her.Find out why.Tell Stephan to ready the jet.I need to go home.Will do.Lets leave as soon as we can.Ill be in the car.Thank you.Taylor heads toward the exit, raising the phone to his ear.Im reeling.Leila.What the hell?Shes been out of my life for a couple of years.Weve shared the occasional e mail.She got married.She seemed happy.Whats happened?I head back into the boardroom and make my apologies before stepping outside into the stifling heat, where Taylor is waiting in the Suburban.The plane will be ready in forty five minutes.We can head back to the hotel, pack, and go, he informs me.Good, I respond, grateful for the cars air conditioning.I should call Gail.Ive tried, but her phone goes to voice mail.I think shes still at the hospital.Okay, Ill call her later.This is not what Gail needs on a Thursday morning.How did Leila get into the apartment?I dont know, sir.Taylor makes eye contact with me in the rearview mirror, his face apologetic and grim at once.Ill make it a priority to find out.OUR BAGS ARE PACKED and were on our way to Savannah/Hilton Head International when I call Ana, but frustratingly, she doesnt answer.I brood, staring out the window as we cruise toward the airport.I dont have to wait long for her to return my call.Anastasia.Hi, she says, her voice breathy, and its such a pleasure to hear her.I have to return to Seattle.Somethings come up.I am on my way to the airport now.Please apologize to your motherI cant make dinner.Nothing serious, I hope?I have a situation that I have to deal with.Ill see you tomorrow.Ill send Taylor to meet you at Sea Tac if I cant come myself.Okay.She sighs.I hope you sort out your situation.Have a safe flight.I wish I didnt have to go.You, too, baby, I whisper, and hang up before I change my mind and stay.I CALL ROS AS we taxi toward the runway.Christian, hows Savannah?Im on the plane coming home.I have a problem I have to deal with.Something at GEH?Ros asks, alarmed.No.Its personal.Anything I can do?No.Ill see you tomorrow.How did your meeting go?Positive.But I had to cut it short.Lets see what they put in writing.I might prefer Detroit just because its cooler.The heats that bad?Suffocating.Ive got to go.Ill call for an update later.Safe travels, Christian.ON THE FLIGHT I throw myself into work to distract me from the problem waiting at home.By the time weve touched down Ive read three reports and written fifteen e mails.Our car is waiting, and Taylor drives through the pouring rain straight to Seattle Free Hope.I have to see Leila and find out what the hell is going on.As we near the hospital my anger surfaces.Why would she do this to me?The rain is lashing down as I climb out of the car; the day is as bleak as my mood.I take a deep breath to control my fury and head through the front doors.At the reception desk I ask for Leila Reed.Are you family?The nurse on duty glowers at me, her mouth pinched and sour.No.I sigh.This is going to be difficult.Well, Im sorry, I cant help you.She tried to open a vein in my apartment.I think Im entitled to know where the hell she is, I hiss through my teeth.Dont take that tone with me!she snaps.I glare at her.Im not going to get anywhere with this woman.Where is your ER department?Sir, theres nothing we can do if youre not family.Dont worry, Ill find it myself, I growl, and storm over to the double doors.I know I could call my mother, who would expedite this for me, but then Id have to explain whats happened.The ER is bustling with doctors and nurses, and triage is full of patients.I accost a young nurse and give her my brightest smile.Hello, Im looking for Leila Reedshe was admitted earlier today.Can you tell me where she might be?And you are?she asks, a flush creeping over her face.Im her brother, I lie smoothly, ignoring her reaction.This way, Mr.Reed.She bustles over to the nurses station and checks her computer.Shes on the second floor; Behavioral Health ward.Take the elevators at the end of the corridor.Thanks.I reward her with a wink and she pushes a stray lock behind her ear, giving me a flirtatious smile that reminds me of a certain girl I left in Georgia.As I step out of the elevator on the second floor I know something is wrong.On the other side of what look like locked doors, two security guards and a nurse are combing the corridor, checking each room.My scalp prickles, but I walk over to the reception area, pretending not to notice the commotion.Can I help you?asks a young man with a ring through his nose.Im looking for Leila Reed.Im her brother.He pales.Oh.Mr.Reed.Can you come with me?I follow him to a waiting room and sit down on the plastic chair that he points to; I note its bolted to the floor.The doctor will be with you shortly.Why cant I see her?I ask.The doctor will explain, he says, his expression guarded, and he exits before I can ask any further questions.Shit.Perhaps Im too late.The thought nauseates me.I get up and pace the small room, contemplating a call to Gail, but I dont have to wait long.A young man with short dreads and dark, intelligent eyes enters.Is he her doctor?Mr.Reed?he asks.Wheres Leila?He assesses me for a moment, then sighs and steels himself.Im afraid I dont know, he says.Shes managed to give us the slip.What?Shes gone.How she got out I dont know.Got out?I exclaim in disbelief, and sink onto one of the chairs.He sits down opposite me.Yes.Shes disappeared.Were doing a search for her now.Shes still here?We dont know.And who are you?I ask.Im Dr.Azikiwe, the on call psychiatrist.He looks too young to be a psychiatrist.What can you tell me about Leila?I ask.Well, she was admitted after a failed suicide attempt.She tried to slash one of her wrists at an ex boyfriends house.His housekeeper brought her here.I feel the blood draining from my face.And?I ask.I need more information.Thats about as much as we know.She said it was an error of judgment, that she was fine, but we wanted to keep her here under observation and ask her further questions.Did you talk to her?I did.Why did she do this?She said it was a cry for help.Nothing more.And, having made such a spectacle of herself, she was embarrassed and wanted to go home.She said she didnt want to kill herself.I believed her.I suspect it was just suicidal ideation on her part.How could you let her escape?I run my hand through my hair, trying to contain my frustration.I dont know how shes gotten away.Therell be an internal investigation.If she contacts you, I suggest you urge her to come back.She needs help.Can I ask you some questions?Sure, I agree, distracted.Is there any history of mental illness in your family?I frown, then remember that hes talking about Leilas family.I dont know.My family is very private about such matters.He looks concerned.Do you know anything about this ex boyfriend?No, I state, a little too quickly.Have you contacted her husband?The doctors eyes widen.Shes married?Yes.Thats not what she told us.Oh.Well, Ill call him.I wont waste any more of your time.But I have more questions for you  Id rather spend my time looking for her.Shes obviously in a bad way.I rise.But, this husband  Ill get in touch with him.This is getting me nowhere.But we should do that Dr.Azikiwe stands.I cant help you.I need to find her.I head to the door.Mr.Reed  Good bye, I mutter, hurrying out of the waiting room and not bothering with the elevator.I take the fire escape stairs two at a time.I loathe hospitals.A memory from my childhood surfaces: Im small and scared and mute, and the smell of disinfectant and blood clouds my nostrils.I shudder.As I step out of the hospital I stand for a moment and let the torrential rain wash that memory away.Its been a stressful afternoon, but at least the rain is a refreshing relief from the heat in Savannah.Taylor swings around to pick me up in the SUV.Home, I direct him, as I get back in the car.Once Ive buckled my seatbelt I call Welch from my cell.Mr.Grey, he growls.Welch, I have a problem.I need you to locate Leila Reed, ne Williams.GAIL IS PALE AND quiet as she studies me with concern.Youre not going to finish, sir?she asks.I shake my head.Was the food okay?Yes, of course.I give her a small smile.After todays events, Im not hungry.How are you bearing up?Im good, Mr.Grey.It was a total shock.I just want to keep busy.I hear you.Thanks for making dinner.If you remember anything, let me know.Of course.But like I said, she only wanted to speak to you.Why?What is she expecting me to do?Thanks for not involving the police.The police are not what that girl needs.She needs help.She does.I wish I knew where she was.Youll find her, she says with quiet confidence, surprising me.Do you need anything?I ask.No, Mr.Grey.Im fine.She takes the plate with my half eaten meal to the sink.The news from Welch about Leila is frustrating.The trail has gone cold.Shes not at the hospital, and theyre still mystified as to how she escaped.A small part of me admires that; she was always resourceful.But what could have made her so unhappy?I rest my head in my hands.What a dayfrom the sublime to the ridiculous.Soaring with Ana, and now this mess to deal with.Taylor is at a loss as to how Leila got into the apartment, and Gail has no idea, either.Apparently, Leila marched into the kitchen demanding to know where I was.And when Gail said I wasnt there, she cried out Hes gone, then slashed her wrist with a box cutter.Fortunately, the cut wasnt deep.I glance at Gail cleaning up in the kitchen.My blood runs cold.Leila could have hurt her.Perhaps Leilas objective was to hurt me.But why?I scrunch my eyes, trying to remember if anything in our last correspondence might give me a clue as to why shes gone off the rails.I draw a blank, exasperated, and with a sigh I head into my study.As I sit down my phone buzzes with a text.Ana?Its Elliot.Hey Hotshot.Wanna shoot some pool?Shooting pool with Elliot means him coming here and drinking all my beer.Frankly, Im not in the mood.Working.Next week?Sure.Before I hit the beach.Ill thrash you.Laters.I toss my phone onto the desk and pore over Leilas file, looking for anything that might give me a clue as to where she is.I find her parents address and phone number, but nothing for her husband.Where is he?Why isnt she with him?I dont want to call her parents and alarm them.I call Welch and give him their number; he can find out if shes been in touch with them.When I switch on my iMac theres an e mail from Ana.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Safe Arrival?Date: June 2 2011 22:32 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Sir,  Please let me know that you have arrived safely.I am starting to worry.Thinking of you.Your Ana x  Before I know it, my finger is on the little kiss shes sent me.Ana.Sappy, Grey.Sappy.Get a grip.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Sorry  Date: June 2 2011 19:36  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele,  I have arrived safely, and please accept my apologies for not letting you know.I dont want to cause you any worry.Its heartwarming to know that you care for me.I am thinking of you, too, and as ever looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.I press send and wish that she was here with me.She brightens up my home, my lifeme.I shake my head at my fanciful thoughts and look through the rest of my e mails.A ping tells me theres a new one from Ana.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: The Situation  Date: June 2 2011 22:40 EST  To: Christian Grey  Dear Mr.Grey,  I think it is very evident that I care for you deeply.How could you doubt that?I hope your situation is under control.Your Ana x  P. S. : Are you going to tell me what I said in my sleep?She cares for me deeply?Thats nice.All at once that foreign feeling, absent all day, stirs and expands in my chest.Beneath it is a well of pain I dont want to acknowledge or deal with.It tugs at a lost memory of a young woman brushing out her long, dark hair  Fuck.Dont go there, Grey.I respond to Anas e mailand as a distraction decide to tease her.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: Pleading the Fifth  Date: June 2 2011 19:45  To: Anastasia Steele  Dear Miss Steele,  I like very much that you care for me.The situation here is not yet resolved.With regard to your P.

cat of my own for growlers.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.She doesnt respond.Five minutes go by and nothing.SixSeven.Damn.She means it.How can I tell her that while she slept she said she wouldnt leave me?Shell think Im crazy.* * *      From: Christian Grey  Subject: What You Said in Your Sleep  Date: June 2 2011 20:20  To: Anastasia Steele  Anastasia,  Id rather hear you say the words that you uttered in your sleep when youre conscious, thats why I wont tell you.Go to sleep.Youll need to be rested, with what I have in mind for you tomorrow.Christian Grey  CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.She doesnt respond; I hope for once shes doing what shes told and shes asleep.Briefly I think of what we could do tomorrow, but its too arousing, so I push the thought aside and concentrate on my e mails.But I have to confess I feel a little lighter after some e mail banter with Miss Steele.Shes good for my dark, dark soul.FRIDAY, JUNE 3, 2011    * * *      I cant sleep.Its after two and Ive been staring at the ceiling for an hour.Tonight its not my sleeping nightmares that are keeping me awake.Its a waking one.Leila Williams.The smoke detector on my ceiling is winking at me, its flashing green light mocking me.Hell!I close my eyes and let my thoughts run free.Why was Leila suicidal?What possessed her?Her desperate unhappiness resonates with a younger, miserable me.Im trying to quash my memories, but the anger and desolation of my solitary teen years resurfaces and it wont go away.It reminds me of my pain and of how I lashed out at everyone during my youth.Suicide crossed my mind often, but I always held back.I resisted for Grace.I knew shed be devastated.I knew she would blame herself if I took my life, and shed done so much for mehow could I hurt her like that?And after I met Elenaeverything changed.Rising from the bed, I push these disquieting thoughts to the back of my mind.I need the piano.I need Ana.If shed signed the contract and everything had gone according to plan, she would be with me, upstairs, asleep.I could wake her, and lose myself in heror, under our new arrangement, she would be beside me, and I could fuck her and then watch her sleep.What would she make of Leila?As I sit down on the piano bench I know that Ana will never meet Leila, which is a good thing.I know how she feels about Elena.Lord knows how shed feel about an exa wayward ex.This is what I cant reconcile: Leila was happy, mischievous, and bright when I knew her.She was an excellent submissive; I thought shed settled down and was happily married.Her e mails never indicated that anything was awry.What went wrong?I start to playand my troubled thoughts recede until its just the music and me.Leila is servicing my cock with her mouth.Her skilled mouth.Her hands are tied behind her back.Her hair braided.Shes on her knees.Eyes cast down.Modest.Alluring.Not seeing me.And suddenly shes Ana.Ana on her knees before me.Naked.Beautiful.My cock in her mouth.But Anas eyes are on mine.Her blazing blue eyes see everything.See me.My soul.She sees the darkness and the monster beneath.Her eyes widen in horror and suddenly she disappears.Shit!I wake with a start, and a painful erection that wanes as soon as I recall Anas wounded look in my dream.What the hell?I rarely have erotic dreams.Why now?I check my alarm; Ive beaten it by a few minutes.The morning sunlight is creeping between the buildings as I rise.Already Im restless, no doubt as a result of my disturbing dream, so I decide to go for a run to burn off some energy.There are no new e mails, no messages, no updates on Leila.The apartment is quiet as I leave.Theres no sign of Gail yet.I hope shes recovered from yesterdays ordeal.I open the glass doors in the lobby, step outside into a balmy, sunny morning, and carefully scan the street.As I start my run I check down the alleys and in the doorways I pass, and behind the parked cars, to see if Leila is there.Where are you, Leila Williams?I turn the volume up on the Foo Fighters and my feet pound the sidewalk.OLIVIA IS EXCEPTIONALLY IRRITATING today.Shes spilled my coffee, dropped an important call, and keeps mooning at me with her big brown eyes.Get Ros back on the line, I bark at her.Better still, get her up here.I shut my office door and go back to my desk; I must try not to take my temper out on my staff.Welch has no news, except that Leilas parents think their daughter is still in Portland with her husband.Theres a knock on my door.Come in.I hope to God its not Olivia.Ros pokes her head around.You wanted to see me?Yes.Sure.Come in.Where are we with Woods?ROS EXITS JUST BEFORE ten.All is on track: Woods has decided to accept the deal, and the aid for Darfur will soon be on the road to Munich in preparation for the airlift.Theres no news yet from Savannah about their offer.I check my inbox and find a welcome e mail from Ana.* * *      From: Anastasia Steele  Subject: Homeward Bound

deafness.Laters.Ana x  My kiss is back.Well, thats a relief.Grudgingly, I drag myself away from the computer screen and pick up my phone to call Welch.AT ONE OCLOCK I decline Andreas offer of lunch at my desk.I need to get out.The walls of my office are closing in on me, and I think its because theres been no news about Leila.Im worried about her.Hell, she came to see me.She decided to use my home as her stage.How could I not take this personally?Why didnt she e mail me or phone?If she was in trouble, I could have helped.I would have helpedIve done it before.I need some fresh air.I march past Olivia and Andrea, who both look busy, though I catch Andreas puzzled look as I step into the elevator.Outside, its a bright, bustling afternoon.I take a deep breath and detect the soothing tang of salt water from the Sound.Perhaps I should take the rest of the day off?But I cant.I have a meeting with the mayor this afternoon.Its irritatingIm seeing him tomorrow at the Chamber of Commerce gala.The gala!Suddenly I have an idea, and with a renewed sense of purpose I head toward a small store I know.AFTER MY MEETING AT the mayors office, I walk the ten or so blocks back to Escala; Taylor has gone to collect Ana from the airport.Gail is in the kitchen when I enter the living room.Good evening, Mr.Grey.Hi, Gail.How was your day?Good, thank you, sir.Feeling better?Yes, sir.The clothes arrived for Miss SteeleI unpacked them and hung them in the closet in her room.Great.No sign of Leila?Dumb question: Gail would have called me.No, sir.This also arrived.She holds up a small red store bag.Good.I take the bag from her, ignoring the delighted twinkle in her eye.How many for supper this evening?Two, thanks.And Gail  Sir?Can you put the satin sheets on the playroom bed?I really hope to get Ana in there at some point over the weekend.Yes, Mr.Grey, she says, her tone a little surprised.She turns back to whatever shes conjuring in the kitchen, leaving me a little baffled by her behavior.Maybe Gail doesnt approve, but its what I want from Ana.In my study I take the Cartier box from its bag.Its a present for Ana, which Ill give to her tomorrow in time for the gala: a pair of earrings.Simple.Elegant.Beautiful.Just like her.I smile; even in her chucks and jeans she has a certain gamine charm.I hope she accepts my gift.As my submissive, shed have no choice, but under our alternative arrangement, I dont know what her reaction will be.Whatever the outcome, it will be interesting.She always surprises me.As I put the box in my desk drawer a ping on my computer distracts me.Barneys latest tablet designs are in my inbox, and Im eager to see them.Five minutes later, Welch calls.Mr.Grey, he wheezes.Yes.What news?I spoke with Russell Reed, Mrs.Reeds husband.And?Immediately Im agitated.I storm out of my study and across the living room to the windows.He says his wife is away visiting her parents, Welch reports.What?Precisely.Welch sounds as pissed as I am.Seeing Seattle at my feet, knowing Mrs.Reed aka Leila Williams is out there somewhere, increases my irritation.I rake my fingers through my hair.Maybe thats what she told him.Maybe, he says.But weve found nothing so far.No trace?I cant believe she could just disappear.Nothing.But if she so much as uses an ATM, cashes a check, or logs in to her social media, well find her.Okay.Wed like to scour the CCTV footage from around the hospital.Its going to cost money and take a little longer.Is that acceptable?Yes.A tingle prickles my scalpnot from the call.For some unknown reason I sense Im being watched.Turning, I see Ana standing on the threshold of the room, scrutinizing me, her brow furrowed and her lips pensive, and shes wearing a short, short skirt.Shes all eyes and legsespecially legs.I imagine them wrapped around my waist.Desire, raw and real, fires my blood as I stare.Well get right on it, Welch says.I finish up with him, my eyes fixed on Anas, and I prowl toward her, stripping off my jacket and tie and tossing them onto the sofa.Ana.I wrap my arms around her, tugging at her ponytail, lifting her eager lips to mine.She tastes of heaven and home and fall and Ana.Her scent invades my nostrils as I take everything her warm, sweet mouth has to offer.My body hardens with expectation and hunger as our tongues entwine.I want to lose myself in her, to forget about the shitty end to my week, forget about everything but her.My lips feverish against hers, I tug the hair tie from her ponytail as her fingers knot in mine.Im suddenly overwhelmed by my need, desperate for her.And I pull away, staring down into a face thats dazed with passion.I feel the same way.What is she doing to me?Whats wrong?she whispers.And the answer is clear, ringing in my head.Ive missed you.Im so glad youre back.Shower with me.Now.Yes, she responds, her voice hoarse.I take her hand and we head to my bathroom.I turn on the shower, then face her.Shes gorgeous, her eyes bright and gleaming with anticipation, as she watches me.My gaze rakes down her body to her naked legs.Ive never seen her in such a short skirt, with so much of her flesh on display, and Im not sure I approve.Shes for my eyes only.I like your skirt.Its very short.Too short.You have great legs.Stepping out of my shoes, I take off my socks, and without breaking eye contact, she, too, slips off her shoes.Fuck the shower.I want her now.Stepping toward her, I clasp her head, and we step back so shes against the tiled wall, her lips parting as she inhales.Holding her face and lacing my fingers into her hair, I kiss her: her cheek, her throat, her mouth.Shes nectar and I cant get enough.Her breath catches in her throat and she grasps my arms, but at her touch theres no protest from the darkness within.Theres just Ana, in all her beauty and innocence, kissing me back with a fervor that matches mine.My blood is thick with desire, my erection painful.I want you now.Herefast, hard, I murmur, as my hand runs up her naked thigh beneath her skirt.Are you still bleeding?No.Good.I push her skirt up over her hips, hook both thumbs into her cotton panties and drop to the floor, kneeling, slipping the panties down her legs.She gasps when I grab her hips and kiss the sweet junction beneath her pubic hair.Moving my hands to the backs of her thighs, I part her legs, exposing her clitoris to my tongue.When I start my sensual assault her fingers dive into my hair.My tongue torments her, and she moans and tips her head back against the wall.She smells exquisite.She tastes better.As she purrs she tilts her pelvis toward my invading, insistent tongue, and her legs begin to tremble.Enough.I want to come inside her.It will be my skin against her skin again, like in Savannah.Releasing her, I stand and grasp her face, capturing her surprised and disappointed mouth with mine, kissing her hard.I unzip my fly and lift her, clutching her under her thighs.Wrap your legs around me, baby.My voice is rough and urgent.As soon as she does, I thrust forward, sliding into her.Shes mine.Shes heaven.Clinging to me, she whimpers as I plunge into herslowly at first, then building as my body takes control, driving me forward, driving me into her, faster and faster, harder and harder, my face at her throat.She moans and I feel her quicken around me, and Im lost, in her, in us, as she climaxes, crying out her release.The feel of her pulsing around me tips me over the edge and I come deep and hard inside her, growling out a garbled version of her name.I kiss her throat, not wanting to withdraw, waiting for her to calm.Were in a cloud of steam from the shower, and my shirt and pants are sticking to my body, but I dont care.Anas breathing slows, and she feels weightier in my arms as she relaxes.Her expression is wanton and dazed as I pull out of her, so I hold her fast while she finds her feet.Her lips rise in a winsome smile.You seem pleased to see me, she says.Yes, Miss Steele, I think my pleasure is pretty self evident.Comelet me get you in the shower.I undress quickly, and when Im naked I begin undoing the buttons on Anas blouse.Her eyes move from my fingers to my face.How was your journey?I ask.Fine, thank you, she says, her voice a little throaty.Thanks once again for first class.It really is a much nicer way to travel.She takes a quick breath, as if shes steeling herself.I have some news, she says.Oh?What now?I remove her blouse and deposit it on top of my clothes.I have a job.She sounds reticent.Why?Did she think Id be angry?Of course shes found a job.Pride swells in my chest.Congratulations, Miss Steele.Now will you tell me where?I ask with a smile.You dont know?Why would I know?With your stalking capabilities, I thought you might have She stops to study my face.Anastasia, I wouldnt dream of interfering in your career.Unless you ask me to, of course.So you have no idea which company?No.I know there are four publishing companies in Seattleso I am assuming its one of them.SIP, she announces.Oh, the small one, good.Well done.Its the company that Ros identified as ripe for takeover.This will be easy.I kiss Anas forehead.Clever girl.When do you start?Monday.That soon, eh?Id better take advantage of you while I still can.Turn around.She obeys immediately.I remove her bra and skirt, then cup her behind and kiss her shoulder.Leaning against her, I nuzzle her hair.Her scent lingers in my nostrils, soothing, familiar, and uniquely Ana.The feel of her body against mine is both calming and enticing.She really is the whole package.You intoxicate me, Miss Steele, and you calm me.Such a heady combination.Grateful that shes here, I kiss her hair, then take her hand and pull her into the hot shower.Ow, she squeaks and closes her eyes, flinching under the steamy cascade.Its only a little hot water.I grin down at her.Opening one eye, she lifts her chin and slowly surrenders to the heat.Turn around, I order.I want to wash you.She complies, and I squeeze some shower gel on my hand, work up a lather, and begin to massage her shoulders.I have something else to tell you, she says, her shoulders tensing.Oh yes?I keep my voice mild.Why is she tense?My hands glide over her chest to her beautiful breasts.My friend Joss photography show is opening Thursday in Portland.Yes, what about it?The photographer again?I said I would go.Do you want to come with me?The words come in a rush, as if shes anxious to get them out.An invitation?Im stunned.I only get invitations from my family, from work, and from Elena.What time?The opening is at seven thirty.This will count as more, surely.I kiss her ear and whisper, Okay.Her shoulders soften as she leans back against me.She seems relieved and Im not sure whether to be amused or annoyed.Am I really that unapproachable?Were you nervous about asking me?Yes.How can you tell?Anastasia, your whole bodys just relaxed.I mask my irritation.Well, you just seem to be, umon the jealous side.Yes.Im jealous.The thought of Ana with anyone else isunsettling.Very unsettling.Yes, I am.And youd do well to remember that.But thank you for asking.Well take Charlie Tango.She flashes me a quick grin as my hands slide down her body, the body shes given to me and no one else.Can I wash you?she asks, diverting me.I dont think so.I kiss her neck as I rinse her back.Will you ever let me touch you?Her voice is a gentle entreaty, but it doesnt stop the darkness thats swirling suddenly from nowhere and tightening around my throat.No.I will it away, cupping and concentrating on Anas ass, her fucking glorious behind.My body responds on a primal levelat war with the darkness.I need her.I need her to chase my fear away.Put your hands on the wall, Anastasia.Im going to take you again, I whisper, and with a startled glance at me, she splays her hands on the tiles.I grab her hips, pulling her back from the wall.Hold fast, Anastasia, I warn, as the water streams over her back.She bends her head and braces herself as my hands sweep through her pubic hair.She squirms, her behind brushing my arousal.Fuck!And like that, my residual fear melts away.Do you want this?I ask as my fingers tease her.In answer she wiggles her butt against my erection, making me smile.Tell me, I demand, my voice strained.Yes.Her agreement slices through the pouring water, keeping the darkness at bay.Oh, baby.Shes still wet from earlierfrom me, from herI dont know.In the moment I give a silent word of thanks to Dr.Greene: no more condoms.I ease into Ana and slowly, deliberately make her mine again.I WRAP HER IN a bathrobe and kiss her soundly.Dry your hair, I order, handing her a hair dryer I never use.Are you hungry?Famished, she admits, and I dont know if she means it or if shes said it merely to please me.But pleased I am.Great.Me, too.Ill check where Mrs.Jones is with dinner.You have ten minutes.Dont get dressed.I kiss her once more and pad out to the kitchen.Gail is washing something at the sink.She looks up as I peer over her shoulder.Clams, Mr.Grey, she says.Delicious.Pasta alle Vongole, one of my favorites.Ten minutes?I ask.Twelve, she says.Great.She gives me a look as I head into my study.I ignore it.Shes seen me in less than my bathrobe beforewhat the hell is her problem?I check through some e mails and my phone to see if theres any news about Leila.Nothingbut since Anas arrival, I dont feel as hopeless as I did earlier.Ana enters the kitchen at the same time that I do, lured no doubt by the tantalizing smell of our dinner.When she sees Mrs.Jones she clutches the neck of her bathrobe.Just in time, Gail says, serving our meal in two large bowls at the place settings on the counter.Sit.I point to one of the barstools.Anas anxious eyes pass from me to Mrs.Jones.Shes self conscious.Baby, I have staff.Get over it.Wine?I offer, to distract her.Please, she says, sounding reserved as she takes her seat.I open a bottle of Sancerre and pour two small glasses.Theres cheese in the fridge if youd like, sir, Gail says.I nod, and she exits the room, much to Anas relief.I take my seat.Cheers.I raise my glass.Cheers, Ana replies, and the crystal glasses sing as we clink.She takes a bite of her food and makes an appreciative noise in the back of her throat.Perhaps she is famished.Are you going to tell me?she asks.Tell you what?Mrs.Jones has outdone herself; the pasta tastes delicious.What I said in my sleep.I shake my head.Eat up.You know I like watching you eat.She pouts with mock exasperation.You are so pervy, she exclaims under her breath.Oh, baby, you have no idea.And a thought springs to mind: maybe we should explore something new in the playroom tonight.Something fun.Tell me about this friend of yours, I ask.My friend?The photographer.I keep my voice light, but she regards me with a fleeting frown.Well, we met the first day of college.Hes an engineering major, but his passion is photography.And?Thats it.Her evasive answers are irritating.Nothing else?She tosses her hair over her shoulder.Weve become good friends.It turns out my dad and Joss dad served together in the military before I was born.Theyve gotten back in touch, and theyre now best buds.Oh.Your dad and his dad?Yeah.She twirls more pasta around her fork.I see.This tastes delicious.She gives me a contented smile, and her robe gapes a little, revealing the swell of her breast.The sight stirs my cock.How are you feeling?I ask.Fine, she says.Up for more?More?More wine?More sex?In the playroom?A small glass, please.I pour her a little more Sancerre.I dont want either of us to drink too much if were going to play.Hows the, umsituation that brought you to Seattle?Leila.Shit.This I do not want to discuss.Out of hand.But nothing for you to worry about, Anastasia.I have plans for you this evening.I want to see if we can play this so called arrangement of ours both ways.Oh?Yes.I want you ready and waiting in my playroom in fifteen minutes.I stand up, watching her closely to gauge her reaction.She takes a quick sip of her wine, her pupils widening.You can get ready in your room.Incidentally, the walk in closet is now full of clothes for you.I dont want any arguments about them.Her mouth sets in a surprised o.  And I give her a stern look, daring her to argue with me.Remarkably, she says nothing, and I head off to my study to send a quick e mail to Ros telling her I want to start the process to acquire SIP as soon as possible.I scan a couple of work e mails, but see nothing in my inbox about Mrs.Reed.I put thoughts of Leila out of my mind; shes preoccupied me for the last twenty four hours.Tonight Im going to focus on Anaand have some fun.When I return to the kitchen Anas disappeared; I presume shes getting ready upstairs.In my closet I remove my robe and slip on my favorite jeans.As I do, images of Ana in my bathroom come to mindher flawless back, then her hands pressed against the tiles while I fucked her.Boy, the girl has stamina.Lets see how much.With a sense of exhilaration I collect my iPod from the living room and bolt upstairs to the playroom.When I find Ana kneeling as she should be at the entrance facing the roomeyes down, legs parted, and wearing only her pantiesmy first feeling is one of relief.Shes still here; shes game.My second is pride: she has followed my instructions to the letter.My smile is hard to hide.Miss Steele does not back down from a challenge.Closing the door behind me, I note that her bathrobe has been hung up on the peg.I walk past her barefoot and deposit my iPod on the chest.Ive decided that Im going to deprive her of all her senses but touch, and see how she fares with that.The bed has been made up with satin sheets.And the leather shackles are in place.At the chest I take out a hair tie, a blindfold, a fur glove, earbuds, and the handy transmitter that Barney designed for my iPod.I lay out the items in a neat row, plugging the transmitter into the top of the iPod, letting Ana wait.Anticipation is half the buildup to a scene.Once Im satisfied I go and stand over her.Anas head is bowed, the ambient light burnishing her hair.She looks modest and beautiful, the epitome of a submissive.You look lovely.I cup her face and tilt her head up until blue eyes meet gray.You are one beautiful woman, Anastasia.And youre all mine, I whisper.Stand up.Shes a little stiff as she gets to her feet.Look at me, I order, and when I look into her eyes I know I could drown in her serious, rapt expression.Ive got her full attention.We dont have a signed contract, Anastasia.But weve discussed limits.And I want to reiterate we have safe words, okay?She blinks a couple of times, but remains mute.What are they?I demand.She hesitates.Oh, this will never do.What are the safe words, Anastasia?Yellow.And?Red.Remember those.She raises an eyebrow in obvious scorn, and is about to say something.Oh no.Not in my playroom.Dont start with your smart mouth in here, Miss Steele.Or I will fuck it with you on your knees.Do you understand?As pleasing as that thought is, her obedience is what I want right now.She swallows her chagrin.Well?Yes, Sir, she says quickly.Good girl.My intention is not that you should use the safe word because youre in pain.What I intend to do to you will be intense.Very intense, and you have to guide me.Do you understand?Her face remains impassive, giving nothing away.This is about touch, Anastasia.You will not be able to see me or hear me.But youll be able to feel me.Ignoring her confounded look, I turn to the audio player above the chest and switch it to auxiliary mode.I just have to choose a song; and in that moment I recall our conversation in the car after shed slept in my bed at The Heathman.Lets see if she likes some Tudor choral music.I am going to tie you to that bed, Anastasia.But Im going to blindfold you first andI show her the iPodyou will not be able to hear me.All you will hear is the music Im going to play for you.I think its surprise I see registering on her face, but Im not sure.Come.I lead her to the foot of the bed.Stand here.Leaning down, I breathe in her sweet scent and whisper in her ear, Wait here.Keep your eyes on the bed.Picture yourself lying here, bound and totally at my mercy.She sucks in her breath.Yes, baby.Think about it.I resist the temptation to plant a soft kiss on her shoulder.I need to braid her hair first and fetch a flogger.From the top of the chest I grab the hair tie, and from the rack I select my favorite flogger, which I stuff into the back pocket of my jeans.When I return to stand behind her, I gently take her hair and braid it.While I like your pigtails, Anastasia, I am impatient to have you right now.So one will have to do.I fasten and tug on the braid so shes forced to step back against me.Winding the end around my wrist, I pull to the right, bending her head to expose her neck.I run my nose from her earlobe to her shoulder, sucking and biting gently.HmmShe smells so good.She shivers and hums deep in her throat.Hush, now, I caution, and taking the flogger from my pocket, I reach around her, my arms brushing hers, and show it to her.I hear her catch her breath and see her fingers twitch.Touch it, I whisper, knowing thats what she wants.She raises her hand, pauses, then runs her fingers through the soft suede tails.Its arousing.I will use this.It will not hurt, but it will bring your blood to the surface of your skin and make you very sensitive.What are the safe words, Anastasia?Umyellow and red, Sir, she murmurs, transfixed by the flogger.Good girl.Remember, most of your fear is in your mind.I drop the flogger on the bed and brush my fingers down her sides, past the soft swell of her hips, and slip them into her panties.You wont be needing these.I drag them down her legs and kneel behind her.She grabs hold of the pillar to shuffle awkwardly out of her underwear.Stand still, I command, and kiss her behind, gently nipping each cheek.Now lie down.Faceup.I spank her once, and she jumps, startled, and scurries onto the bed.She lies down facing me, her eyes on mine, glowing with excitementand a little trepidation, I think.Hands above your head.She does as shes told.I retrieve the earbuds, blindfold, iPod, and the remote from atop the chest of drawers.Sitting beside her on the bed, I show her the iPod with the transmitter.Her look darts from my face to the devices and back again.This sends whats playing on the iPod to the system in the room.I can hear what youre hearing, and I have a remote control unit for it.Once shes seen everything, I insert the earbuds into her ears and place the iPod on the pillow.Lift your head.She obeys, and I slip the blindfold over her eyes.Rising, I take her left hand and cuff her wrist to the leather shackle at the top corner of the bed.I let my fingers linger down her outstretched arm and she wriggles in response.As I walk slowly around the bed, her head follows the sound of my footsteps; I repeat the process with her right hand, cuffing her wrist.Anas breathing alters, becoming erratic and fast through parted lips.A flush creeps up her chest, and she squirms and lifts her hips in anticipation.Good.At the bottom of the bed I grab both her ankles.Lift your head again, I order.She does so immediately, and I drag her down the bed so that her arms are fully extended.She lets out a quiet moan and lifts her hips once more.I cuff each of her ankles to the corresponding corner of the bed so that shes spread eagled before me and I step back to admire the view.Fuck.Has she ever looked this hot?Shes totally and willingly at my mercy.The knowledge is intoxicating, and I stand for a moment to marvel at her generosity and courage.I drag myself away from the spellbinding sight and from the chest of drawers collect the rabbit fur glove.Before I put it on I press play on the remote; theres a brief hiss, and then the forty part motet begins, the singers angelic voice ringing through the playroom and over the delectable Miss Steele.She stills as she listens.And I walk around the bed, drinking her in.Reaching out, I caress her neck with the glove.She inhales sharply and pulls at her shackles, but she doesnt cry out or tell me to stop.Slowly I run my gloved hand down her throat, over her sternum, then over her breasts, enjoying her restrained squirm.Circling her breasts, I gently tug on each of her nipples, and her moan of appreciation encourages me to head south.At a leisurely, deliberate pace I explore her body: her belly, her hips, the apex of her thighs, and down each leg.The music swells, more voices joining the choir in perfect counterpoint to my moving hand.I watch her mouth to determine how shes feeling; now she gapes in pleasure, now she bites her lip.When I run my hand over her sex she clenches her behind, pushing herself into my hand.Though I normally like her to keep still, the movement pleases me.Miss Steele is enjoying this.Shes greedy.When I brush her breasts again her nipples harden in the wake of the glove.Yes.Now that her skin is sensitized I remove the glove and pick up the flogger.With great care I trail the beaded ends over her skin, following the same pattern: over her chest, her breasts, her belly, through her pubic hair, and down her legs.As more choristers lend their voices to the motet I lift the handle of the flogger and flick the tresses across her belly.She cries out, I think in surprise, but she doesnt safe word.I give her a moment to absorb the sensation, then do it againa little harder this time.She pulls at her shackles and calls out once more, a garbled crybut its not the safe word.I lash the flogger over her breasts, and she tilts her head back and lets out a soundless cry, her mouth slack as she writhes on the red satin.Still no safe word.Ana is embracing her inner freak.I feel giddy with delight as I rain the tails up and down her body, watching her skin warm under their bite.When the choristers pause, so do I.   Christ.She looks stunning.I begin again as the music crescendoes, all the voices singing together; I flick the flogger over her, again and again, and she writhes beneath each blow.When the last note rings through the room I stop, dropping the flogger on the floor.Im breathless, panting with want and need.Fuck.She lays on the bed, helpless, her skin pretty in pink, and shes panting, too.Oh, baby.I climb onto the bed between her legs and crawl over her, holding myself above her.When the music starts again, the lone voice singing a sweet seraphic note, I follow the same pattern as the glove and the floggerbut this time with my mouth, kissing and sucking and worshipping every inch of her body.I tease each of her nipples until they are glistening with my saliva and standing at attention.She writhes as much as the restraints allow and groans beneath me.My tongue trails down to her belly, around her navel, laving her.Tasting her.Venerating her.Moving down, through her pubic hair to her sweet, exposed clitoris thats begging for the touch of my tongue.Around and around I swirl, drinking in her scent, drinking in her reaction, until I feel her tremble beneath me.Oh no.Not yet, Ana.Not yet.I stop and she huffs her voiceless disappointment.I kneel up between her legs and pull open my fly, freeing my erection.Then, leaning over, I gently undo the left shackle around her ankle.She curls her leg around me in a long limbed caress while I release her other ankle.Once shes free I massage and knead the life back into her legs, from her calves up to her thighs.She wriggles beneath me, raising her hips in perfect rhythm to the Tallis motet, as my thumbs work their way up her inner thighs, which are dewy from her arousal.I stifle a growl and grasp her hips, lifting her from the bed, and in one swift, rough move I bury myself inside her.Fuck.Shes slick and hot and wet and her body pulses around me, on the edge.No.Too soon.Way too soon.I stop, holding myself still over her and in her, while sweat beads on my brow.Please, she calls out, and I tighten my hold on her as I quell the urge to move and lose myself in her.Closing my eyes so I cant see her laid out beneath me in all her wonder, I concentrate on the music; and once Im in control again, slowly I start to move.As the intensity of the choral piece builds I slowly increase my pace, matching the power and rhythm of the music, cherishing every tight inch inside her.She fists her hands and tilts her head back and moans.Yes.Please, she pleads between gritted teeth.I hear you, baby.Laying her back down on the bed, I stretch out over her, supporting my weight on my elbows, and I follow the rhythm, thrusting into her and losing myself in her and the music.Sweet, brave Ana.Sweat glides down my back.Come on, baby.Please.And finally she explodes around me, shouting out her release and pushing me into an intense, draining climax where I lose all sense of self.I collapse on top of her as my world shifts and realigns, leaving that unfamiliar emotion swirling in my chest, consuming me.I shake my head, trying to chase away the ominous and confusing feeling.Reaching up, I grab the remote and switch off the music.No more Tallis.The music definitely contributed to what was almost a religious experience.I frown, attempting but failing to get a handle on my feelings.I slide out of Ana and stretch to release her from each cuff.She sighs as she flexes her fingers, and gently I remove the blindfold and the earbuds.Big blue eyes blink up at me.Hi, I whisper.Hi, yourself, she says, playful and bashful.Her response is delightful and, leaning down, I plant a tender kiss on her lips.Well done, you.My voice is filled with pride.She did it.She took it.She took it all.Turn over.Her eyes widen in alarm.Im just going to rub your shoulders.Oh, okay.She rolls over and flops down on the bed with her eyes closed.I sit astride her and massage her shoulders.A pleasurable rumble resonates deep in her throat.What was that music?she asks.Its called Spem in Alium, a forty part motet by Thomas Tallis.It wasoverwhelming.Ive always wanted to fuck to it.Not another first, Mr.Grey?I grin.Indeed, Miss Steele.Well, its the first time Ive fucked to it, too, she says, her voice betraying her fatigue.You and I, were giving each other many firsts.What did I say to you in my sleep, Chriser, Sir?Not this again.Put her out of her misery, Grey.You said lots of things, Anastasia.You talked about cages and strawberries.That you wanted more, and that you missed me.Is that all?She sounds relieved.Why would she be relieved?I stretch out beside her so I can see her face.What did you think youd said?She opens her eyes for a brief moment, and shuts them again quickly.That I thought you were ugly, conceited, and that you were hopeless in bed.One blue eye peeks open and watches me warily.Ohshes lying.Well, naturally I am all those things, and now youve got me really intrigued.What are you hiding from me, Miss Steele?Im not hiding anything.Anastasia, youre a hopeless liar.I thought you were going to make me giggle after sex; this isnt doing it for me.Her answer is unexpected, and I give her a reluctant smile.I cant tell jokes, I confess.Mr.Grey!Something you cant do?She rewards me with a broad, infectious grin.No, hopeless joke teller, I say, as if its a badge of honor.She giggles.Im a hopeless joke teller, too.That is such a lovely sound, I whisper, and kiss her.But I still want to know why shes relieved.And you are hiding something, Anastasia.I may have to torture it out of you.Ha!The space between us is filled with her laughter.I think youve done enough torturing.Her response wipes the smile off my face, and her expression softens immediately.Maybe Ill let you torture me like that again, she says coyly.Relief sweeps through me.Id like that very much, Miss Steele.We aim to please, Mr.Grey.Youre okay?I ask, humbled and anxious at once.More than okay.She gives me her timid smile.Youre amazing.I kiss her forehead, then climb off the bed as that ominous feeling ripples through me once more.Shaking it off, I button my fly and hold out my hand to help her off the bed.When shes standing I pull her into my arms and kiss her, savoring her taste.Bed, I mutter, and lead her to the door.There I wrap her in the bathrobe shes left hanging on the peg, and before she can protest I pick her up and carry her downstairs to my bedroom.Im so tired, she mumbles once shes in my bed.Sleep now, I whisper, and wrap her in my arms.I close my eyes, fighting the disquieting sensation that surges and fills my chest once more.Its like homesickness and a homecoming rolled into oneand its terrifying.SATURDAY, JUNE 4, 2011    * * *      The summer breeze teases my hair, its caress the nimble fingers of a lover.My lover.Ana.I wake suddenly, confused.My bedroom is shrouded in darkness, and beside me Ana sleeps, her breathing gentle and even.I prop myself up on one elbow and run my hand through my hair, with the uncanny feeling that someone has just done exactly that.I glance around the room, peering into the shadowy corners, but Ana and I are alone.Strange.I could swear someone was here.Someone touched me.It was just a dream.I shake off the disturbing thought and check the time.Its after 4:30 in the morning.As I flop back down onto my pillow, Ana mumbles an incoherent word and turns over to face me, still fast asleep.She looks serene and beautiful.I stare at the ceiling, the flashing light of the smoke alarm taunting me once more.We have no contract.Yet Anas here.Beside me.What does this mean?How am I supposed to deal with her?Will she abide by my rules?I need to know that shes safe.I rub my face.This is uncharted territory for me; its out of my control, and its unsettling.Leila pops into my mind.Shit.My mind races: Leila, work, Anaand I know I wont get back to sleep.Getting up, I pull on some PJ pants, close the bedroom door, and head into the living room to my piano.Chopin is my solace; the somber notes match my mood and I play them over and over.A small movement at the edge of my vision catches my attention, and looking up, I see its Ana coming toward me, her footsteps hesitant.You should be asleep, I mutter, but continue playing.So should you, she volleys back.Her face is firm with resolve, yet she looks small and vulnerable dressed only in my oversized bathrobe.I hide my smile.Are you scolding me, Miss Steele?Yes, Mr.Grey, I am.Well, I cant sleep.I have too much weighing on my mind, and Id rather she went back to bed and slept.She must be tired from yesterday.She disregards my mood and sits down beside me on the piano bench, leaning her head on my shoulder.Its such a tender and intimate gesture that for a moment I lose my place in the prelude, but I continue playing, feeling more at peace because shes with me.What was that?she asks when I finish.Chopin.A prelude.Opus twenty eight, number four.In E minor, if youre interested.Im always interested in what you do.Sweet Ana.I kiss her hair.I didnt mean to wake you.You didnt, she says, not moving her head.Play the other one.Other one?The Bach piece that you played the first night I stayed.Oh, the Marcello.I cant remember when I last played for someone upon request.For me the piano is a solitary instrument, for my ears only.My family hasnt heard me play for years.But since shes asked, Ill play for my sweet Ana.My fingers caress the keys and the haunting melody echoes through the living room.Why do you only play such sad music?she asks.Is it sad?So you were just six when you started to play?She continues her questions, lifting her head and studying me.Her face is open and eager for information, as usual; and after last night, who am I to deny her anything?I threw myself into learning the piano to please my new mother.To fit into the perfect family?My words from our candid night in Savannah echo in her soft voice.Yes, so to speak.I dont want to talk about this and Im surprised how much of my personal information shes retained.Why are you awake?Dont you need to recover from yesterdays exertions?Its eight in the morning for me.And I need to take my pill.Well remembered, I muse.Only you would start a course of time specific birth control pills in a different time zone.Perhaps you should wait half an hour, and then another half hour tomorrow morning.So eventually you can take them at a reasonable time.Good plan, she says.So what shall we do for half an hour?Well, I could fuck you over this piano.I can think of a few things.My voice is seductive.On the other hand, we could talk.She smiles, provocative.Im not in the mood for talking.I prefer what I have in mind.I snake my arm around her waist, pull her into my lap, and nuzzle her hair.Youd always rather have sex than talk.She laughs.True.Especially with you.Her hands curl around my biceps, yet the darkness stays still and quiet.I trail kisses from the base of her ear to her throat.Maybe on my piano, I murmur, as my body responds to a mental image of her sprawled naked on the top, her hair spilling down over the side.I want to get something straight.She speaks quietly in my ear.Always so eager for information, Miss Steele.What needs straightening out?Her skin is soft and warm against my lips as I nudge her bathrobe off her shoulder with my nose.Us, she says, and the simple word sounds like a prayer.Hmm.What about us?I pause.Where is she going with this?The contract.I stop and stare down into her shrewd gaze.Why is she doing this now?My fingers glide down her cheek.Well, I think the contract is moot, dont you?Moot?she says, and her lips soften with the hint of a smile.Moot.I mirror her expression.But you were so keen.Uncertainty clouds Anas eyes.Well, that was before.Anyway, the rules arent moot, they still stand.I need to know youre safe.Before?Before what?Before Before all this.Before you turned my world upside down, before you sleeping with me.Before you laid your head on my shoulder at the piano.Its all ...More, I murmur, driving away the now familiar unease in my gut.Oh, she says, and I think shes pleased.Besides, weve been in the playroom twice now, and you havent run screaming for the hills.Do you expect me to?Nothing you do is expected, Anastasia.The v between her brows is back.So, let me be clear.You just want me to follow the rules element of the contract all the time, but not the rest of the contract?Except in the playroom.I want you to follow the spirit of the contract in the playroom, and yes, I want you to follow the rulesall the time.Then Ill know youre safe.And Ill be able to have you anytime I wish, I add flippantly.And if I break one of the rules?she asks.Then Ill punish you.But wont you need my permission?Yes, I will.And if I say no?she persists.Why is she being so willful?If you say no, youll say no.Ill have to find a way to persuade you.She should know this.She didnt let me spank her in the boathouse, and I wanted to.But I got to do it later that eveningwith her approval.She stands and walks toward the entrance of the living room, and for a moment I think shes storming off, but she turns, her expression perplexed.So the punishment aspect remains.Yes, but only if you break the rules.This is clear to me.Why not to her?Ill need to reread them, she says, suddenly all businesslike.She wants to do this now?Ill fetch them for you.In my study I fire up my computer and print out the rules, wondering why we are discussing this at five in the morning.Shes at the sink, drinking a glass of water, when I return with the printout.I sit down on a stool and wait, watching her.Her back is stiff and tense; this does not bode well.When she turns around I slide the sheet of paper toward her across the kitchen island.Here you go.She scans the rules quickly.So the obedience thing still stands?Oh yes.She shakes her head, and an ironic smile tugs at the corner of her mouth as her eyes dart to the heavens.Oh joy.My spirits suddenly lift.Did you just roll your eyes at me, Anastasia?Possibly.Depends what your reaction is.She looks wary and amused at once.Same as always.If shell let me  She swallows and her eyes widen with anticipation.So  Yes?You want to spank me now?Yes.And I will.Oh, really, Mr.Grey?She folds her arms, her chin thrust upward in a challenge.Are you going to stop me?Youre going to have to catch me first.She wears a coquettish smile, which addresses my dick directly.She wants to play.I ease myself off the stool, watching her carefully.Oh, really, Miss Steele?The air almost crackles between us.Which way will she run?Her eyes are on mine, brimming with excitement.Her teeth tease her lower lip.And youre biting your lip.Is she doing it on purpose?I move slowly to my left.You wouldnt, she taunts.After all, you roll your eyes.With her eyes fixed on me, she, too, moves to her left.Yes, but youve just raised the bar on the excitement stakes with this game.Im quite fast, you know, she teases.So am I.   How does she make everything so thrilling?Are you going to come quietly?Do I ever?She grins, taking the bait.Miss Steele, what do you mean?I stalk her around the kitchen island.Itll be worse for you if I have to come and get you.Thats only if you catch me, Christian.And right now, I have no intention of letting you catch me.Is she serious?Anastasia, you may fall and hurt yourself.Which will put you in direct contravention of rule number seven, now six.I have been in danger since I met you, Mr.Grey, rules or no rules.Yes, you have.Perhaps this is not a game.Is she trying to tell me something?She hesitates, and I make a sudden lunge to grab her.She squeals and dashes around the island, to the relative safety of the opposite side of the dining table.With her lips parted, her expression both wary and daring at once, the bathrobe slips off one shoulder.She looks hot.Really fucking hot.Slowly I prowl toward her, and she backs away.You certainly know how to distract a man, Anastasia.We aim to please, Mr.Grey.Distract you from what?Life.The universe.Ex subs whove gone missing.Work.Our arrangement.Everything.You did seem very preoccupied as you were playing.Shes not backing down.I stop and fold my arms, reassessing my strategy.We can do this all day, baby, but I will get you, and it will just be worse for you when I do.No, you wont, she says, with absolute certainty.I frown.Anyone would think you didnt want me to catch you.I dont.Thats the point.I feel about punishment the way you feel about me touching you.And from nowhere the darkness crawls over me, shrouding my skin, leaving an icy trail of despair in its wake.No.No.I cant bear to be touched.Ever.Thats how you feel?Its like shes touched me, her nails leaving white tracks over my chest.She blinks several times, assessing my reaction, and when she speaks her voice is gentle.No.It doesnt affect me quite as much as that, but it gives you an idea.Her expression is anxious.Well, hell!This shines a whole different light on our relationship.Oh, I mutter, because I cant think of anything else to say.She takes a deep breath and approaches me, and when shes standing in front of me she looks up, her eyes burning with apprehension.You hate it that much?I whisper.This is it.We are really incompatible.No.I dont want to believe that.Wellno, she says, and relief washes through me.No, she continues.I feel ambivalent about it.I dont like it, but I dont hate it.But last night, in the playroom, you  I do it for you, Christian, because you need it.I dont.You didnt hurt me last night.That was in a different context, and I can rationalize that internally, and I trust you.But when you want to punish me, I worry that youll hurt me.Fuck.Tell her.Its truth or dare time, Grey.I want to hurt you.But not beyond anything that you couldnt take.Id never go too far.Why?I just need it, I whisper.I cant tell you.Cant or wont?Wont.So you know why?Yes.But you wont tell me.If I do, you will run screaming from this room, and youll never want to return.I cant risk that, Anastasia.You want me to stay.More than you know.I couldnt bear to lose you.I can no longer stomach the distance between us.I grab her to stop her from running, and I pull her into my arms, my lips seeking hers.She answers my need, her mouth molding to mine, kissing me back with the same passion and hope and longing.The hovering darkness recedes and I find my solace.Dont leave me, I whisper against her lips.You said you wouldnt leave me, and you begged me not to leave you, in your sleep.I dont want to go, she says, but her eyes are searching mine, looking for answers.And Im exposedmy ugly, torn soul on display.Show me, she says.And I dont know what she means.Show you?Show me how much it can hurt.What?I lean back and stare at her in disbelief.Punish me.I want to know how bad it can get.Oh no.I release her and step out of her reach.She gazes at me: open, honest, serious.Shes offering herself to me once more; mine for the taking, to do with as I wish.Im stunned.Shed fulfill this need for me?I cant believe it.You would try?Yes.I said I would.Her expression is full of resolve.Ana, youre so confusing.Im confused, too.Im trying to work this out.And you and I will know, once and for all, if I can do this.If I can handle this, then maybe you  She stops, and I take a further step back.She wants to touch me.No.But if we do this, then Ill know.Shell know.Were here much sooner than I thought wed be.Can I do this?And in that moment I know theres nothing I want moreTheres nothing that will satisfy the monster within me more.Before I can change my mind I grasp her arm and lead her upstairs to the playroom.At the door I stop.Ill show you how bad it can be, and you can make your own mind up.Are you ready for this?She nods, her face set with the stubborn determination that Ive come to know so well.So be it.I open the door, quickly grab a belt from the rack before she changes her mind, and lead her to the bench in the corner of the room.Bend over the bench, I order quietly.She does as shes told, saying nothing.Were here because you said yes, Anastasia.And you ran from me.I am going to hit you six times, and you will count with me.Still she says nothing.I fold the hem of her bathrobe over her back, revealing her beautiful naked behind.I run my palm over her buttocks and the top of her thighs, and a frisson runs through me.This is it.What I want.What Ive been working toward.I am doing this so that you remember not to run from me, and as exciting as it is, I never want you to run from me.And you rolled your eyes at me.You know how I feel about that.I take a deep breath, savoring this moment, trying to steady my thundering heartbeat.I need this.This is what I do.And were finally here.She can do it.Shes never let me down yet.Holding her in place with one hand at the small of her back, I shake out the belt.I take another deep breath, focusing on the task in hand.She wont run.Shes asked me.Then I wield it, striking her across both cheeks, hard.She cries out, in shock.But shes not called out the numberor the safe word.Count, Anastasia!I demand.One!she shouts.Okayno safe word.I hit her again.Two!she screams.Thats right, let it out, baby.I hit her once more.Three!She winces.There are three stripes across her backside.I make it four.She shouts the number, loud and clear.Theres no one to hear you, baby.Shout all you need.I belt her again.Five, she sobs, and I pause, waiting for her to safe word.She doesnt.And one for luck.Six, Ana whispers, her voice forced and hoarse.I drop the belt, savoring my sweet, euphoric release.Im punch drunk, breathless, and finally replete.Oh, this beautiful girl, my beautiful girl.I want to kiss every inch of her body.Were here.Where I want to be.I reach for her, pulling her into my arms.Let go.No She struggles out of my grasp, scrambling away from me, pushing and shoving and finally turning on me like a seething wildcat.Dont touch me!she hisses.Her face is blotchy and smeared with tears, her nose is running, and her hair is a dark, tangled mess, but she has never looked so magnificentand at the same time so angry.Her anger crashes over me like a tidal wave.Shes mad.Really mad.Okay, I hadnt figured on anger.Give her a moment.Wait for the endorphins to kick in.She dashes away her tears with the back of her hand.This is what you really like?Me, like this?She wipes her nose with the sleeve of the bathrobe.My euphoria vanishes.Im stunned, completely helpless and paralyzed by her anger.The crying I know and understand, but this ragesomewhere deep inside it resonates with me and I dont want to think about that.Dont go there, Grey.Why didnt she ask me to stop?She didnt safe word.She deserved to be punished.She ran from me.She rolled her eyes.This is what happens when you defy me, baby.She scowls.Blue eyes wide and bright, filled with hurt and rage and sudden, chilling insight.Shit.What have I done?Its sobering.Im unbalanced, teetering at the edge of a dangerous precipice, desperately searching for the words to make this right, but my mind is blank.Well, you are one fucked up son of a bitch, she snarls.All the breath leaves my body, and its like shes whipped me with a beltFuck!Shes recognized me for what I am.Shes seen the monster.Ana, I whisper, pleading with her.I want her to stop.I want to hold her and make the pain go away.I want her to sob in my arms.Dont you dare Ana me!You need to sort your shit out, Grey!she snaps, and walks out of the playroom, quietly shutting the door behind her.Stunned, I stare at the closed door, her words ringing in my ears.You are one fucked up son of a bitch.No one has ever walked out on me.What the hell?Mechanically, I run my hand through my hair, trying to rationalize her reaction, and mine.I just let her go.Im not madImwhat?I stoop to pick up the belt, walk to the wall, and hang it on its peg.That was, without doubt, one of the most satisfying moments of my life.A moment ago I felt lighter, the weight of uncertainty between us gone.Its done.Were there.Now that she knows whats involved, we can move on.I told her.People like me like inflicting pain.But only on women who like it.My sense of unease grows.Her reactionthe image of her injured, haunted look is back, unwelcome, in my minds eye.Its unsettling.I am used to making women cryits what I do.But Ana?I sink to the floor and lean my head against the wall, my arms on my bent knees.Just let her cry.Shell feel better for crying.Women do, in my experience.Give her a moment, then go and offer her aftercare.She didnt safe word.She asked me.She wanted to know, curious as ever.Its just been a rude awakening, thats all.You are one fucked up son of a bitch.Closing my eyes, I smile without humor.Yes, Ana, yes I am, and now you know.Now we can move forward with our relationshiparrangement.Whatever this is.My thoughts dont comfort me and my sense of unease grows.Her wounded eyes glaring at me, outraged, accusatory, pityingshe can see me for what I am.A monster.Flynn springs to mind: Dont dwell on the negative, Christian.I close my eyes once more and see Anas anguished face.What a fool I am.This was too soon.Way, way too soon.Fuck.Ill reassure her.Yeslet her cry, then reassure her.I was angry with her for running from me.Why did she do that?Hell.Shes so different from any other woman Ive known.Of course she wouldnt react in the same way.I need to face her, hold her.Well get through this.I wonder where she is.Shit!Panic seizes me.Suppose shes gone?No, she wouldnt do that.Not without saying good bye.I stand and race out of the room and down the stairs.Shes not in the living roomshe must be in bed.I dash to my bedroom.The bed is empty.Full blown anxiety erupts in the pit of my belly.No, she cant have gone!Upstairsshe must be in her room.I take the stairs three at a time and pause, breathless, outside her bedroom door.Shes in there, crying.Oh, thank God.I lean my head against the door, overwhelmed by my relief.Dont leave.The thought is awful.Of course she just needs to cry.Taking a steadying breath, I head to the bathroom beside the playroom to fetch some arnica cream, Advil, and a glass of water, and I return to her room.Inside its still dark, though dawn is a pale streak on the horizon, and it takes me a moment to find my beautiful girl.Shes curled up in the middle of the bed, small and vulnerable, sobbing quietly.The sound of her grief rips through me, leaving me winded.My subs never affected me like thiseven when they were bawling.I dont get it.Why do I feel so lost?Putting down the arnica, water, and tablets, I lift the comforter, slide in beside her, and reach for her.She stiffens, her whole body screaming, Dont touch me!The irony is not lost on me.Hush, I whisper, in a vain attempt to halt her tears and calm her.She doesnt respond.She remains frozen, unyielding.Dont fight me, Ana, please.She relaxes a fraction, allowing me to pull her into my arms, and I bury my nose in her wonderfully fragrant hair.She smells as sweet as ever, her scent a soothing balm to my nerves.And I plant a tender kiss on her neck.Dont hate me, I murmur, as I press my lips to her throat, tasting her.She says nothing, but slowly her crying dissipates into soft sniffling sobs.
