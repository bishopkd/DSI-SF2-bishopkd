How about you?she asked.Did you ever think about us?All the time.I still do.Are you seeing anyone?No, he answered, shaking his head.He finished his beer.Im going to go and start the water.Can I get you anything?She shook her head, and Noah went to the kitchen and put the crabs in the steamer and the bread in the oven.He found some flour and cornflour for the vegetables, coated them, and put some fat into the frying pan.After turning the heat on low, he set a timer and pulled another beer from the icebox before heading back to the porch.And while he was doing those things, he thought about Allie and the love that was missing from both their lives.Allie, too, was thinking.About Noah, about herself, about a lot of things.For a moment she wished that she werent engaged, but then quickly cursed herself.It wasnt Noah she loved; she loved what they once had been.Besides, it was normal to feel this way.Her first real love, the only man shed ever been with how could she expect to forget him?Yet was it normal for her insides to twitch whenever he came near?Was it normal to confess things she could never tell anyone else?Was it normal to come here three weeks before her wedding day?No, its not, she finally whispered to herself as she looked to the evening sky, theres nothing normal about any of this.Noah came out at that moment and she smiled at him, glad hed come back so she didnt have to think about it any more.Its going to take a few minutes, he said as he sat down.Thats fine.Im not that hungry yet.He looked at her then, and she saw the softness in his eyes.Im glad you came, Allie, he said.Me too.I almost didnt, though.Why did you come?I was compelled, she wanted to say, but didnt.Just to see you, to find out what youve been up to.To see how you are.He wondered if that was all, but didnt question further.Instead he changed the subject.By the way.Ive been meaning to ask, do you still paint?She shook her head.Not any more.He was stunned.Why not?You have so much talent.Its a long story.Ive got all night, he answered.Did you really think I was talented?she asked quietly.Cmon, he said, reaching out for her hand.I want to show you something.She got up and followed him through the door to the living room.He stopped in front of the fireplace and pointed to the painting that hung above the mantelpiece.She gasped, surprised she hadnt noticed it earlier, more surprised it was here at all.You kept it?Of course I kept it.Its wonderful.She gave him a sceptical look, and he explained.It makes me feel alive when I look at it.Sometimes I have to get up and touch it.Its just so real the shapes, the shadows, the colours.Its incredible, Allie.You mean to tell me no one has ever told you that before?My professor did, she said, but I guess I didnt believe him.He knew there was more.Allie looked away before continuing Ive been drawing and painting since I was a child.I guess that once I got a little older I began to think I was good at it.I enjoyed it too.I remember working on this painting that summer, adding to it every day, changing it as our relationship changed.I dont even remember how it started or what I wanted it to be, but somehow it evolved into this.I remember being unable to stop painting after I went home that summer.I think it was my way of avoiding the pain I was going through.Anyway.I ended up majoring in art in college because it was something I had to do; I remember spending hours in the studio all by myself and enjoyed every minute.I loved the freedom I felt when I created, the way it made me feel to make something beautiful.Just before I graduated, my professor, who happened to also be the critic for the paper, told me I had a lot of talent.He told me I should try my luck as an artist.But I didnt listen to him.She stopped for a moment, gathering her thoughts.My parents didnt think it was proper for someone like me to paint for a living.I just stopped after a while.I havent touched a brush in years.She stared at the painting.Im not sure if I can paint any more.Its been a long time.You can still do it.Allie.I know you can.You have a talent that comes from inside you, from your heart, not from your fingers.What you have cant ever go away.Its what other people only dream about.Youre an artist, Allie.The words were spoken with such sincerity that she knew he wasnt saying it just to be nice.He truly believed in her ability, and for some reason that meant more to her than she expected.She turned to face him.She reached over and touched his hand, hesitantly, gently, amazed that after all these years had somehow known exactly what shed needed to hear.When their eyes locked, she once again realized how special he was.And for just a fleeting moment, a tiny wisp of time that hung in the air like fireflies in summer skies, she wondered if she was in love with him again.THE TIMER WENT off in the kitchen, and Noah turned away, strangely affected by what had just happened between them.Her eyes had spoken to him and whispered something he longed to hear; yet he couldnt stop the voice inside his head, her voice that had told him of her love for another man.He silently cursed the timer as he walked to the kitchen and removed the bread from the oven.He saw that the frying pan was ready.He added the vegetables and heard them begin to crackle.Then he got some butter out of the icebox, spread some on the bread and melted a hit more for the crabs.Allie had followed him into the kitchen and cleared her throat.Can I get the table ready?Noah used the bread knife as a pointer.Sure, plates are over there.Utensils and napkins there.Make sure you get plenty  crabs can be messy.He couldnt look at her as he spoke.He didnt want to be mistaken about what had just happened between them.Allie too, was wondering about the moment and feeling warm as she thought of it.The words hed spoken replayed in her head as she found everything she needed for the table settings.Noah handed her the bread and their fingers touched briefly.He turned his attention back to the frying pan and stirred the vegetables.He lifted the lid of the steamer, saw the crabs still had a minute, and let them cook some more.He was more composed now and returned to small talk, easy conversation.Have you ever had crab before?A couple of times.But only in salads.He laughed.Then youre in for an adventure.Hold on a second.He disappeared upstairs for a moment, then returned with a navy blue button down shirt.He held it out for her.Here, put this on.I dont want you to stain your dress.Allie put it on and smelt the fragrance that lingered in the shirt his smell, distinctive, natural.Dont worry.he said, seeing her expression, its clean.She laughed.I know.It just reminds me of our first real date.You gave me your jacket that night, remember?He nodded.The vegetables and crabs were ready at about the same time.Be careful, theyre hot.he said as he handed them to her, and they sat across from each other at the small wooden table.Then realizing the tea was still on the counter, Allie stood and brought it over.After putting some vegetables and bread on their plates, Noah added a crab, and Allie sat for a moment, staring at it.It looks like a bug.A good bug, though, he said.Here, let me show you how its done.He made it look easy, removing the meat and putting it on her plate.Allie crushed the legs too hard the first time and had to use her fingers to get the shells away from the meat.She felt clumsy, worrying that he saw every mistake, but then she realized her own insecurity.He didnt care about things like that He never had.So, tell me everything youve been up to since I saw you last, she asked.They started to talk then, making up for lost time.Noah talked about leaving New Bern, about working in the shipyard and at the scrap yard in New Jersey.He spoke fondly of Morris Goldman and touched on the war a little, and told her how much he missed his father.Allie talked about going to college, painting, and her hours spent volunteering at the hospital.She talked about her family and Mends and the charities she was involved with.Neither of them brought up anybody they had dated since theyd last seen each other.Even Lon was ignored, and though both of them noticed the omission, neither mentioned it.Afterwards Allie tried to remember the last time she and Lon had talked this way.Although he listened well and they seldom argued, he was not the type of man to talk like this.Like her father, he wasnt comfortable sharing feelings.Shed tried to explain that she needed to be closer to him, but it had never seemed to make a difference.Sitting here now, she realized what shed been missing.The sky grew darker and the moon rose higher as the evening wore on.And without either of them being conscious of it, they began to regain the intimacy, the bond of familiarity, they had once shared.THEY FINISHED dinner, both pleased with the meal, neither talking much now.Noah looked at his watch and saw that it was getting late.The stars were out in full, the crickets a little quieter.He had enjoyed talking to Allie and wondered what shed thought about his life, hoping it would somehow make a difference, if it could.He got up and refilled the kettle.They both brought the dishes to the sink and cleaned the table, and he poured two more cups of hot water, adding tea bags to both.How about the porch again?he asked, handing her the cup, and she agreed, leading the way.He grabbed a quilt for her in case she got cold, and soon they had taken their places again, the quilt over her legs, rockers moving.Noah watched her from the corner of his eye.God, shes beautiful, he thought.And inside he ached.For something had happened during dinner.Quite simply, he had fallen in love again.He knew that now as they sat next to one another.Fallen in love with a new Allie, not just her memory.But then he had never really stopped, and this, he realized, was his destiny.Its been quite a night.he said, his voice softer now.Yes, it has.she said, a wonderful night.Noah glanced up at the stars, their twinkling lights reminding him that she would he leaving soon, and he felt almost empty inside.This was a night he wanted never to end.How should he tell her?What could he say that would make her stay?He didnt know.And thus the decision was made to say nothing.And he realized then that he had failed.The rockers moved in quiet rhythm.Talk to me, she finally said, her voice sensual.Or was his mind playing tricks?What should I say?Talk like you did to me under the oak tree.And he did, reciting distant passages, toasting the night.Whitman and Thomas, because he loved the images, Tennyson and Browning, because their themes felt so familiar.She rested her head against the back of the rocker, closing her eyes.It wasnt just the poems or his voice that did it.It was all of it, the whole greater than the sum of the parts.She didnt try to break it down, didnt want to, because it wasnt meant to he listened to that way.Poetry, she thought, wasnt written to he analysed: it was meant to inspire without reason, to touch without understanding.They rocked for a while, drinking tea, sitting quietly, drifting in their thoughts.The compulsion that had driven her here was gone now she was glad of this but she worried about the feelings that had taken its place, the stirrings that had begun to sift and swirl in her pores like gold dust in river pans.Shed tried to deny them, hide from them, but now she realized that she didnt want them to stop.Lon could not evoke these feelings in her.He never had and probably never would.Maybe that was why she had never been to bed with him.She had always used the excuse that she wanted to wait until marriage.He took it well, usually, and she sometimes wondered how hurt he would be if he ever found out about Noah.But there was something else that made her want to wait, and it had to do with Lon himself.He was driven in his work, and it always came first.For him there was no time for poems and wasted evenings on porches.She knew this was why he was successful, and part of her respected him for that.But she also sensed it wasnt enough.She wanted something more.Passion and romance, perhaps, or quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second.Noah, too, was sifting through his thoughts.As he rocked, he remembered the thousands of empty nights he had spent since theyd last seen each other.Seeing her again brought all those feelings to the surface, and he found it impossible to press them back down.He knew then he wanted to make love to her again and to have her love in return.It was what he needed most in the world.But he also realized it could never be.Now that she was engaged.Allie knew by his silence that he was thinking about her and found that she revelled in it.She thought about their conversation at dinner and wondered about loneliness.For some reason she couldnt picture him reading poetry to someone else or even sharing his dreams with another woman.He didnt seem the type.Either that, or she didnt want to believe it.She put down the tea, then ran her hands through her hair, closing her eyes as she did so.Are you tired?he asked, finally breaking free from his thoughts.A little.I should really he going in a couple of minutes.I know.he said, nodding, his tone neutral.She didnt get up right away.Instead she picked up the cup and drank the last swallow of tea, feeling it warm her throat.She took the evening in.Moon higher now, temperature dropping.She looked at Noah.A scar was visible on the side of his face that hadnt been there before.She wondered if it had happened during the war.He hadnt mentioned it and she hadnt asked, mostly because she didnt want to imagine him being hurt.I should go, she finally said, handing the quilt back to him.Noah nodded, then stood without a word.He carried the quilt, and the two of them walked to her car while fallen leaves crunched beneath their feet.She started to take off the shirt hed lent her as he opened the door, but he stopped her.Keep it, he said.I want you to have it.She didnt ask why, because she wanted to keep it, too.She readjusted it and crossed her arms afterwards to ward off the chill.For some reason, as she stood there, she was reminded of standing on her front porch after a high school dance, waiting for a kiss.I had a great time tonight, he said, thank you for finding me.I did, too, she answered.He summoned his courage.Will I see you tomorrow?A simple question.She knew what the answer should be.I dont think we should, was all she had to say, and it would end right here and now.But for a second the demon of choice confronted her, teased her, challenged her.Why couldnt she say it?As she looked in his eyes to find the answer she needed, she saw the man shed once fallen in love with, and suddenly it all came clear.Id like that.Noah was surprised.He hadnt expected her to answer this way.He wanted to touch her then, to take her in his arms, but he didnt.Can you be here about noon?Sure.What do you want to do?Youll see, he answered.I know just the place to go.Have I ever been there before?No, but its a special place.Youll love it.She moved away before he could attempt a kiss.She didnt know if he would try but knew for some reason that, if he did, she would have a hard time stopping him.She slid behind the wheel, breathing a sigh of relief.He shut the door for her, and she started the engine.As the car idled, she rolled down the window just a hit.See you tomorrow, she said, her eyes reflecting the moonlight.Noah waved as she turned the car around and then drove up the lane, heading hack towards town.He watched until the lights vanished behind far off oak trees and the engine noise was gone.Clem wandered up to him and he squatted down to pet her, paying special attention to her neck, scratching the spot she couldnt reach any more.Then they returned to the back porch side by side.He sat in the rocker again, trying once more to fathom the evening that had just passed.Replaying it.Running it in slow motion.Shes engaged, he finally whispered, and then was silent for hours, his rocker making the only noise.The night was quiet, with little activity except for Clem, who checked on him occasionally as if to ask, Are you all right?And some time after midnight on that clear October evening, Noah was overcome with longing.And if anyone had seen him, they would have seen what looked like an old man, someone whod aged a lifetime in just a couple of hours.Someone bent over in his rocker with his face in his hands and tears in his eyes.He didnt know how to stop them.LON HUNG up the phone.He had called at seven, then at eight thirty, and now he checked his watch again.Nine forty five.Where was she?He knew she was where she had said she would he because he had spoken to the manager.Yes, she had checked in and he had last seen her around six.Going to dinner, he thought.No, he hadnt seen her since.Lon shook his head and leaned hack in his chair.He was the last one in the office as usual.That was normal with an ongoing trial, even if the trial was going well.Law was his passion, and the late hours alone gave him the opportunity to catch up on his work without interruption.He knew he would win the case because he mastered the law and charmed the jury.He always did, and losses were infrequent now.Part of it came from being able to select the cases he had the expertise to win.Only a select few lawyers in the city had that kind of stature, and his earnings reflected it.But most of his success came from hard work.He had always paid attention to details, especially when hed begun his practice.Little things, obscure things, and it had become a habit now.And now a little detail bothered him.Not about the case.
