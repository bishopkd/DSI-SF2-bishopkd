Tom didnt tell you he was Scotts stepson.He misled you, and it only makes sense that Scott was part of this underhanded scheme, too.The only sensible response is to walk out now, before either man hurts you further.Mom, Ive already agreed to meet my father for dinner.But  I have questions only my father can answer.A noise that sounded suspiciously like a sob echoed through the phone.Oh Ellie, Im afraid youre setting yourself up for more heartache.You could very well be right.The same noise repeated itself, and now Ellie was convinced her mother was weeping.I loved him, you know, Virginia whispered, loved him more than life itself.We were both so young and proud.How did he look, Ellie?Is he well?The questions took Ellie by surprise.Shed expected a diatribe or some form of denunciation instead of an inquiry.He looked  fine.Ellie found it interesting that her father had asked about her mother first thing, too.I didnt recognize him, Ellie added, reminding her mother that no pictures of Scott remained in the house.Well, none that she knew of.The only one she could ever remember seeing of her father had been in her early childhood.His image had long ago disappeared from her memory.When are you meeting him?Mom, Ellie said, doing her best to be patient.What does it matter where or when?It matters to me.The words pitched back and forth on an emotional wobble.Ellie could hear the tears in her mothers voice, and it shocked her.Mom, why are you crying?Im not crying  Im shook up is all  your father and I  that was a lot of years ago.Ellie wasnt sure what to make of her mothers reaction.Her fathers name hadnt been mentioned in years.The last thing she expected was for her mother to get emotional.When you meet him, will you  can you tell him something for me?her mother asked.Of course.No, her mother said, abruptly changing her mind.Dont say anything about me, okay?Youre sure?Im sure, say absolutely nothing about me.Wait  tell him  no, dont say anything.Mom   Call me after your dinner, her mother instructed, and it sounded more like a plea than a request.Ellie found she couldnt speak.Ellie?Her mother whispered her name.Are you still there?Yes, she whispered back.When Ellie was in grade school, she fell and broke her arm.While waiting in the nurses office for her mother to arrive to take her to the hospital, she gently rocked back and forth, holding her throbbing arm close to her side.The pain had been horrific.All she could think about was that she wanted her mother.Everything would be better once her mother was with her.Ellie felt much the same way now.I should have listened to you  I should never have come to Cedar Cove.This is all one huge mistake.Im ready to leave.No, dont, Virginia whispered.Dont  but you just told me I should.I was wrong.You told your father you would have dinner with him, and for both your sakes, I think it would be a good thing.If you leave now youll always wonder, always regret the fact that you let this opportunity go.You deserve answers.Dont let my negative experience taint your relationship with your father, Ellie.This didnt sound like her mother.Are you sure?Yes.Ill come to you.Mom, thats generous, but there arent that many flights out of Bend, and for you to drive would take a good five to six hours.The line went suspiciously quiet.Actually, it wont take that long.It wont?Im here already.She bolted to her feet.Youre here?In Cedar Cove?Ellie pressed her hand against her forehead with disbelief.Virginia made a small, almost indecipherable sound before she said, If you must know, I spent the night in Tacoma.You did what?I never intended for you to know.I was terribly worried that something would happen to you.I know youre probably upset with me, and I cant say that I blame you, but think of it from my point of view.You knew next to nothing about this man you met over the Internet, and I was afraid for you.I didnt dare tell you I intended to be close by, for fear youd get upset.Ellie was upset, but not for the reasons her mother assumed.You followed me?Ellie couldnt believe what she was hearing.Not followed  exactly.Her mother seemed eager to defend herself and show that she had only Ellies best interests at heart.I wanted to be close by in case something happened, and it has, hasnt it?Please dont be angry with me.Ellie should be, but at the moment she could only be grateful.How soon can you get here?she asked.I wont be long, Virginia promised.Give me an hour.Ellie used the next sixty minutes to lie down and rest her eyes, not that she was able to relax, let alone fall asleep.By the time her mother arrived, she stood by the window overlooking the inns driveway, watching and waiting, eager to talk over the events of the day with her mother.When Virginia arrived, Ellie hurried down the front steps and the two gripped hold of each other and hugged each other close.She touched Ellies head but didnt mention the new hairstyle.Her mother looked pointedly toward the inn.Can we sit down and talk?As you can imagine, I didnt sleep well last night.Worrying about me, no doubt, Ellie murmured, well aware that her mother had stayed up past midnight, waiting to hear from her.Right away she felt guilty for the way shed treated her mother.They were close and had always been that way.I had one of my headaches, her mother confessed, but thats neither here nor there.Ellie led the way to the inn, up the porch steps to the two chairs set up on the wraparound deck.The water view was amazing, but she didnt comment, and neither did her mother.Ellie didnt say anything until they were both seated.Okay, Mom, do your worst.My worst?Virginia repeated indignantly.Youre about to list all the reasons why it was a bad idea for me to come to Cedar Cove to meet Tom.In retrospect, she wondered if itd been the right thing, seeing all that had happened since.I wasnt, her mother argued.All I wanted to do was protect you.Im grateful I was close by.I am, too, Ellie said, although it was hard to admit.Your  father, Virginia said after a brief hesitation, broke my heart.I loved him   And he abandoned you, Ellie finished for her, having heard it dozens of times through the years.He abandoned us, Virginia corrected.He knew what Tom was up to, didnt he?I dont think so.The shocked look of dismay she read in Scott couldnt be easily fabricated.Her father had looked as bewildered as shed been when Tom introduced her.Tom sprang it on him this morning.Our meeting seemed to be as much a shock to Scott as it was to me.A perplexed look came over Virginia.You mean to say Tom didnt tell Scott who you were?No.As far as my father knew, I was someone Tom met online and that was it.Both Scott  my dad and I were left in the dark.Something else came to mind.It wasnt until Ellie saw her father that she understood the worried look Tom had had when hed mentioned his surprise.If her father wasnt in on this, then she wasnt the only one Tom had misled.It all started to add up in her mind, and the result didnt make her feel any better.While Toms intentions had been good, hed used her gullibility and trust to trick her.Once hed convinced her to visit Cedar Cove, he had what he wanted.She couldnt deal with her feelings for Tom now, though.Dont make the same mistake I did, Ellie.Dont trust Tom.He misled you once, and theres nothing to say he wouldnt again.Im frightened that if you continue in this relationship youll end up badly hurt.Mom, Im old enough to make my own decisions.Trust me, will you?I trusted your father.Mom   Virginia straightened, her shoulders tight and square.Its not fair that he should stroll back into your life at this late date.He doesnt have the right.Ellie heard the pain in her mother and wished that she was able to ease it, and at the same time realized she had to make up her own mind when it came to her father, and basically hed already done that for her.Her mother had a faraway look come over her.Im going to tell you something Ive never shared with anyone.Her voice dipped to a whisper and trembled slightly.I wrote your father shortly after he moved out, before the divorce was final.A friend got his address for me, and without my parents knowing what I was doing, I wrote him.Her voice pitched back and forth like a small boat in a storm.She paused briefly to regain control of her emotions before she continued.I told him I was wrong, and I asked him for your sake and for mine, too, if he would reconsider and give our marriage a second chance.I was willing to do whatever was necessary to be the wife he wanted.Ellie was shocked.For nearly her entire life all Ellie had heard regarding her father were disparaging words.All along her mother had claimed they were well rid of Scott Reynolds.Hed been a poor provider, shiftless, and on top of everything else, he possessed a weak character.For her mother to have swallowed her pride and reached out to him was huge.You never said anything about this before.This revelation took courage, and her mothers honesty surprised her, although it wasnt enough to change Ellies mind.Not even my parents knew, Virginia told her.My family would have been dead set against us getting back together, and I knew that, but I loved Scott and I didnt want the divorce.What happened?Ellie asked, needing to know.Her mother looked out over the cove for several moments before she spoke.He never answered.A list of possible reasons immediately came to mind.Maybe he didnt get the letter; maybe hed moved and it wasnt forwarded.Do you think Grandma and Grandpa found the letter?And really, Mom, if you wanted to reach Dad, why didnt you just call him?Then she could be sure that he knew her heart and that Virginia wanted their marriage to work.I would have phoned him if Id had a number, her mother explained.Things were different back then.There werent cells or the Internet.My parents were urging me to file for a divorce.We fought and he left and I didnt see him again.Ellie read the pain in her mother and felt a prick of discomfort herself.When she met Scott she would ask him why he hadnt responded to the letter.She feared it was because hed fallen out of love with her mother and wanted nothing more to do with either of them.Even if that was the case, she needed to know.Tom seemed to imply that wasnt the way it was.According to him, Scott, too, lived with regrets  as well he should.Later  Her mother paused and seemed to need a few minutes to compose herself.I tried again later.When?You were five and started asking questions about your dad.Ellie remembered that vividly.That was when I wanted that doll for my birthday, wasnt it?Her mother nodded.My parents didnt know, but I couldnt bear to have you asking about your father.It took some doing, but I found him.Did he pay child support?Her mother lowered her head, refusing to meet Ellies eyes.Yes  faithfully.That isnt what you told me.I  was hurt and I didnt want you to  In other words, you misled me.Ellie thought about all the things shed heard about her father not caring about her welfare.Scott had mentioned that he hadnt been given any parental rights and couldnt afford to hire an attorney to fight for them.Yes, I lied.But why?That didnt make sense to Ellie.Again her mother lowered her head as though ashamed.I have no excuse  I told myself it was a protective measure.If you had negative feelings about your father, then he wouldnt have a chance to hurt you the way he did me.Oh Mom.I know, and Im sorry, Ellie.You said you tried to reach him again later?Shed gotten sidetracked but wanted to hear what else her mother had to say.When I was five and wanted a doll for my birthday.Yes.She hesitated long enough to swallow and seemed to need to collect her thoughts.My parents meant well, but my mother spoiled you something terrible.You were her only grandchild and the apple of her eye.But I could see how badly you needed a fathers influence.My dad tried, but he was older and often impatient.I was beginning to feel like a burden living with my family.Then you started asking questions about your daddy and I couldnt bear it.I looked for Scott and was willing to do anything to bring him back into our lives, even if it meant standing up to my parents.Did you find him?Ellie asked, and her voice, too, had dropped to a whisper, as if she were afraid speaking out loud would somehow dissuade her mother from explaining the truth.Virginia wrung her hands and nodded.And?Ellie pressed.Again it seemed to take several minutes for her mother to gain her composure enough to continue.I found him  he was living in the Tacoma area.I went to see him.Did Grandma and Grandpa know what you were doing?No, I didnt dare tell them  at least not until afterward, when  She bit off this last part as if she couldnt find it in her to say the words aloud.Once I told them what happened, my mother was deeply upset.Shed warned me about Scott again and again, but I refused to listen.When Dad heard what Id done, he was furious with me.You found my father?Ellie didnt want her mother to sidestep what had happened at their meeting.It was important that Ellie know, especially before she met her father for dinner.Already she knew more than she ever had, and she wanted to keep the flow of information coming.You went to Tacoma to find my father.Yes, Virginia answered simply.What did he say?Ellie asked, more gently this time, seeing how fragile her mother looked.Her shoulders had slumped slightly forward, as if weighted down by years of sadness and pain.I  I didnt speak to him.Ellie noticed that her mother struggled to keep from weeping.Feeling dreadful for her, Ellie reached across and gripped hold of her mothers hand.Why not, Momyoud come so far?Seeing that shed defied her parents and gone to the trouble to locate Scott, something dreadful must have taken place that prevented Virginia from following through.I discovered Scott had a new wife and a new family, her mother whispered brokenly.I saw them all together  and they were happy, laughing and joking together.Scott was out in the front yard tossing a baseball back and forth with two young boys.I sat in my car, watching them all.Ellie could easily picture the scene.Her mother parked against the curb, gathering her nerve to walk up to the front door and knock, only to have Scott come out front to play ball with his stepsons.One of whom must have been Tom.Ellie swallowed back her hurt and disillusionment.I dont know how long I sat in my car, but eventually a woman came outside with a tray filled with glasses of lemonade and cookies.Ellie knew her mothers heart must have sunk at this perfect picture of the idyllic family.Then, her mother continued in the same low tones, Scott wrapped his arm around this other womans waist and kissed her.Hed found someone else to love.The boys called him Dad, and that told me everything I needed to know.I was too late.If Id gone to talk to him I would only have been an embarrassment.This explained a great deal to Ellie.It was from that point on that her mothers love for her father had turned to something just short of hate.That was the only way Virginia had found to deal with the rejection and the loss.Keeping Ellie away from her father was a form of protection for them both.While that was an excuse, it hadnt been right.Deep down, Virginia recognized that Ellie deserved to know her father.I can understand why you left without speaking to him, Ellie assured her mother.Seeing how miserable she was stuck with overbearing parents and a strong willed child while her ex husband had found a new family and a new life.To rub salt in her mothers wounds, by all appearances her ex husband was far happier than Virginia had ever made him.I couldnt make myself do it, her mother whispered.I returned home, sobbing the entire way, and when I got to the house I confessed to my parents what Id done.It went without saying how upset her grandparents would have been with their daughter.Mom tried to comfort me, but Dad said I deserved what I got by running back to that riffraff.Ellie remembered something else.Grandpa bought me the doll.He did.And I loved it.Her mother looked stricken.You didnt, Ellie, you didnt at all.What do you mean?Ellie could remember the delight she felt when she got the special gift shed longed for the year she turned five.I was so excited when I opened that present.You loved that doll until you learned it wasnt from your daddy.From that point on, you rarely played with it.Ellie didnt remember it like that.In fact, I had to take it away from you because I found you jumping on it and crying.Youd never done anything like that before.I was shocked and put the doll up and out of sight.That hardly seemed possible.Ellie was always a well behaved childat least that was the way she liked to think of herself.After a while I gave it back to you.Before I could stop you, you grabbed hold of the dolls arm and tossed it against the wall, claiming you hated that toy.I didnt.Ellies hand came up to her chest in shock that she would treat any of her things in such a manner.Her grandfather would have been outraged.You cried and cried and said you didnt want it any longer.I was sure youd change your mind, but you didnt.In the end, I took it away from you.The reason was obvious, although Ellie had no memory of any of this.A couple years later we gave the doll away to a charity.All Ellie recalled was how desperately shed wanted this special doll, but hearing her mother recount the story told her that what Ellie had really wanted was the father shed never known.24     Once home, I unloaded my purchases from the farmers market and immediately dealt with the clams and fresh salmon, storing them in the refrigerator.I found my conversation with Corrie McAfee enlightening.Little by little, I was learning details about Mark, and key elements were starting to come together in my head.He had money, or did at one time.If so, he lived frugally.What Corrie said about him possibly having served in the military came as a surprise.As we walked back to the inn I asked Mark about that and hed actually warned me off.Unfortunately the conversation had gotten out of hand, which I regretted.Leave it, hed said to me.Leave it, Id echoed, and then, because hed irritated me, Id added, What exactly does that mean?Mark arched his thick brows as if the question caught him off guard.I beg your pardon?You cant say something like that to me and expect it to go unchallenged.His forehead creased with a deep frown.I dont know what youre talking about.Yes, you do, I insisted.You more or less just warned me off.He shook his head as if I was speaking utter nonsense and then had the audacity to say, No, I didnt.If he thought he could downplay the comment, then he was wrong.Maybe I should accept that challenge.What I should do is call Roy McAfee, I said, staring him down, and pay him to do a background check on you.Go ahead.Mark didnt appear the least bit threatened.He grinned and appeared to be enjoying our outlandish exchange.Theres nothing to find, but if you want to waste your money, then feel free.I glared at him, half expecting him to laugh.His face, to my disappointment, remained completely deadpan.I hope you know how much you irritate me.I irritate you?he asked, as if astonished.Youre the one whos constantly harping on me.I most certainly am not.Oh, the man was impossible.I am probably one of the most even tempered, likeable women youll ever meet.I didnt take this insult lightly.You know what?I said.It might do us both a world of good to stay away from each other for a while.I wasnt sure how serious I was, but I wasnt willing to back down.He shrugged as if it wouldnt matter to him one way or the other.Thats fine with me.Would you like me to stop work on the gazebo?Dont think I havent got plenty of other projects in the works.If you want me to stay away, then far be it from me to trespass where Im not welcome.All of a sudden Rover let loose with a piercing howl that startled both of us.I gasped with surprise, and Mark looked equally taken aback.Rover sat on his haunches and stared up at the pair of us as if to comment that this disagreement had gone on long enough.He doesnt like to hear us fighting, I suspected.Probably not.Mark looked down and shuffled his feet.I was willing to admit that Id let my temper get the better of me.This was rare for me.Generally, Im not one to fly off the handle or make idle threats.Id pounced on Mark and felt I owed him an apology.Rovers right.Youre a good friend and whatever is in your past that youre hiding is your business.Its none of my affair.His brows came together in a thick frown.Who says Im hiding anything?Right.It was better not to broach that subject, seeing that we clearly disagreed.Mark sighed.I guess I got pretty hot under the collar, too.I take it you still want me to work on the gazebo.I do.The one thing I didnt want was for the gazebo project to linger on for months, the way the rose garden had.He nodded, accepting my peace offering.If you really want to make it up to me, Id take a few more of those cookies you baked yesterday morning.The man was so predictable.Ill see what I can do.Jo Marie?Yeah?I turned back from the cookie jar to find him staring at me intently.It looked as if he wanted to say something but felt unsure.What?I asked.Ive noticed something about you.Oh?He hesitated.Youve been acting a bit off lately.I have?I nearly laughed out loud.I was sure this was an exaggeration.Although to be fair, I felt I should give him the opportunity to explain himself.How do you mean?He shrugged as if uncomfortable with the conversation, but now that hed started, he couldnt very well stop.First off, youve been prying into my life.Yeah, well   And youve been moody, too.No, I havent, I argued.Really, this was too much.And odd.Odd?This time I couldnt stop myself, and I gave one short laugh.Mark stuffed his hands into his pockets.The other day, out of the blue, you started talking about Pauls sweatshirt.I froze.You made some nonsensical comment about it losing its scent.I didnt move, barely breathed.We were talking about something else entirely and then you blurted this out, and for a moment I thought you were about to cry.I dont understand it.He waited, as if he wanted me to explain.I couldnt.Is that all?I asked, making light of it.No, theres something else.There was more?Youve been in this cleaning frenzy, rearranging cupboards, putting down shelf paper, bringing items out of the attic, and thats only what Ive seen.A couple nights Ive looked at the inn and your light is on well past midnight.Youre having trouble sleeping, too, arent you?That was true, but I wasnt about to admit it.As best I can tell, all this odd behavior started about the time you got Pauls last letter.Oh.I probably should have put up a defense, explained that he was wrong, completely off base.I wanted to but didnt, mainly because I feared he might be right.This wasnt easy to admit.All of a sudden his gaze narrowed.You okay?Of course I am, I insisted, with more bravado than I felt.He seemed to be waiting for me to hand him the cookies.I did, but still he lingered.You dont look okay.Im fine, I insisted, and let it be known that I didnt appreciate him pressuring me.He shrugged as if to say he wasnt willing to argue about it.If you say so.Before he left, he thoughtfully filled Rovers water dish and then stepped back as my comfort dog eagerly lapped it up, splashing water over the sides of his bowl.After Mark was gone, I couldnt seem to hold still.I moved from room to room with no purpose or destination in mind.I was at a loss; the more I thought about what hed said, the more upset I got.I wrapped my arms around my middle and fought off the urge to cry.My husband was dead.Id watched his casket being lowered into the ground with full military regalia.Paul wasnt coming home.Id done my best to accept this new reality and I thought I was okay.Maybe I wasnt doing as well as Id assumed.Not knowing quite what to do, I reached for my phone and called my mother.I needed the distraction, and I wanted to put Marks comments out of my head.Hi, honey, my mother greeted, sounding cheerful and happy, in stark contrast to my current state of mind.Hi.A brief hesitation followed before Mom asked, Is something wrong?My mother could read me like a book; she always could.I hardly knew where to start.Dinner is still on, isnt it?Your father and I are looking forward to spending time with you.Yes, I wouldnt cancel for the world  I thought I should tell you Mark Taylor wont be coming.I dont know why I felt it was necessary to give her that information when I had so much else on my mind.Oh, thats a disappointment, Mom said with a sigh.I was looking forward to meeting him.Im fine with it, Mom.Id like for you to meet Mark, but its no big deal.Hes a handyman and thats all.And a friend, Mom added.Right, I returned, with no real conviction.Mom paused.Sweetie, whats wrong?Nothing, I quickly assured her.I didnt want to get into it with my mother so soon after my confrontation with Mark.Nor did I want to tell her how much I missed Paul.I know youre disappointed that Mark wont be joining us for dinner.I was looking forward to meeting him, and your father was, too.Perhaps another time.As for me getting a read on him, I think youd be a better judge of him than I would ever be, my mother advised.I doubt that.Id already tried, with little success.Hes obviously important to you  Mark?Important to me?I said, cutting her off.Youre joking, right?Mark is a handyman and Ive hired him because he does good work, but mostly he frustrates me.I dont need that kind of aggravation in my life, and, frankly, Im through with him.Once this gazebo is finished, thats it.My mind was made up.If you say so, dear.I say so.And I meant it, too.I turned around and found a woman standing in the doorway leading into the kitchen.For an instant she startled me, and my hand flew to my chest.I didnt know there was anyone else in the house, especially a stranger.She wasnt a guest, and there wasnt anyone else registered on the books.Hold on a minute, Mom, I said.I lowered the phone.Can I help you?I asked.Really what I wanted to know was how she got into the house, which to the best of my knowledge had been locked.I dont mean to interrupt your conversation, she said.Im Virginia Reynolds, Ellies mother.Ellies mother, I repeated.Oh dear, this wasnt a good sign.I was wondering if I could rent a room for the night.25     After hearing the news that Maggie was pregnant, Roy went cold and silent.She glanced at him as he continued driving back to Cedar Cove and the inn, but he refused to look at her, his gaze steadfastly glued to the road ahead.His hands were so tightly wrapped around the steering wheel that his knuckles had gone stark white.Maggie wanted to say something, but really, what was there to say?When shed discovered she was pregnant with each one of the boys, the emotions she felt were so completely different than what she was experiencing now.Thered been joy, excitement and happiness, anticipation and expectation.She felt none of that now.The one dominating emotion was dread.How could you have let something like this happen?Roy demanded.Anger curdled her stomach.Maggies instinct was to lash back and remind her husband he wasnt so innocent in this fiasco.She wasnt the only one whod strayed.He could pretend he was the injured party, but she wasnt about to put up with his verbal abuse.Im going to pretend you didnt ask that, Roy, she said, with all the dignity she could assemble.Her clenched hands rested in her lap as she struggled within herself, fighting down nausea mixed with shock and dismay.Her husband went silent again.An eternity passed before he spoke.What are you going to do about it?It?she repeated.This pregnancy, Maggie.Dont be coy with me.A child is not an it, she reminded him.That had always been a pet peeve of hers, as Roy well knew.This was a baby, a human being, a life that was growing inside of her.To me this child is an it, he returned pointedly.I dont want it.In other words, you want me to get an abortion.She couldnt believe she would even make such a suggestion.Her heart pounded stronger and louder than a marching band drum corps.It astonished her that no one else seemed to be able to hear it, the sound deafening in its intensity.You dont mean that, Roy insisted.I dont know what I mean anymore, she said, hardly able to get the words out.Its what you want.Admit it.An abortion would solve everything, right?We could do away with the baby and everything would go back to normal.Thats what youre thinking, admit it, Roy.Okay, yes.It would solve everything.She turned her head and looked out the passenger window.Have we really been married all these years without you knowing me, Roy?she asked in a whisper.Do you really believe I could abort this child and that would actually help our situation?He didnt answer, and then finally he whispered, Okay, youre right.That wouldnt work.If you went through with it, youd never be able to live with yourself.He sounded more reasonable now, and for that she was thankful.Thank you, she whispered.That doesnt change how I feel about this baby.I dont want anything to do with this pregnancy or this child.Nothing.Or me?Again he paused, the silence so loud it felt as if he was shouting, and in some ways that would have been easier to tolerate than this  nothingness.He didnt want anything to do with her?It took a while for the words to sink in, and even then she wasnt entirely sure what he meant.He seemed to be suggesting that he wanted out of the marriage.The mere thought caused her blood to run cold.But  we dont know if this baby is yours or not.Im not taking the chance, because Im telling you right now, Maggie, I wont raise another mans child.Maggie was about to argue when Roy cursed and immediately slowed down.Twisting around, Maggie noticed a cop car racing up behind them, lights flashing.Were you speeding?she asked.He glared at her, and that was answer enough.Roy pulled over to the side of the road and the state patrol vehicle pulled in behind him.Releasing his seat belt, Roy reached for his wallet and removed his drivers license while Maggie opened the glove compartment and retrieved the registration card and proof of insurance.When the officer approached, Roy rolled down the window.Good afternoon, folks, he greeted.Roy didnt answer.Do you realize how fast you were driving?Again Roy was silent and stared straight ahead as he handed the state trooper the necessary paperwork.I clocked you at eighty two miles an hour.Maggie had no idea Roy was speeding to that extent.The speed limit here is sixty.This wasnt going to be a cheap ticket.The officer took the paperwork back to his vehicle and returned a few minutes later with the ticket.He recited a list of instructions, but Maggie didnt pay attention, and she doubted that Roy did, either.He seemed frozen in anger.As soon as the trooper left, Roy rolled up his window and merged with the other traffic.I suppose the speeding ticket is my fault as well as everything else, she said.Roy was silent for the next several miles.The tension was as thick as concrete and just as heavy, weighing on her, dragging her down until she felt as if she were sinking in thick mud.What do you intend to do?he demanded, shocking her by breaking the silence.I  think thats a question you need to answer, not me.As far as Maggie could see, she didnt really have a choice.She was pregnant, and she would give birth to this child, who was innocent.His silence told her everything she needed to know.He wanted out of the marriage.Maggie turned her head away and looked out the side window, closing her eyes.Theyd come so far this weekend.Theyd talked of forgiveness and a fresh start, and now this.A sense of hopelessness threatened to swallow her.That morning, only a few hours ago, shed been positive that despite everything they would survive as a couple.It didnt look that way now  it felt as if all was lost.I think we can both agree that its over.Im done, Maggie.Done.I cant deal with this.Youre asking for a divorce?she whispered, hardly able to believe her husband, praying he wasnt serious and yet knowing he was.The marriage is over, he confirmed.I wont be put in this position, understand?Maggie squeezed her eyes closed as the pain rocked over her in harsh waves before she slowly nodded.I wont raise another mans child.Youve made that clear, she whispered, her voice trembling.Dont think a few tears are going to make me change my mind.I couldnt be any more serious.Maggie didnt doubt him.I believe you.I wont pay child support, either.Got that?Got it, but you need not have worried.I wouldnt ever ask that of you.Maggies hand trembled as she brushed the hair from her face.Im glad we cleared that up.Thankfully, hed slowed down to the speed limit.Anything else you want to say?Roy asked her.No, Maggie whispered.Good.His voice was as cold as arctic ice.In retrospect, there was.Actually, there is  something I want to say, that is.Knowing any show of emotion would only anger him, she swallowed down her tears.This very well could be your child, Roy.He seemed to weigh her words.It doesnt matter.Maggie nearly gasped but managed to stop herself.It doesnt matter?As far as Im concerned, were finished.The only thing left for Maggie to do was to accept his decision.Baby or no baby, it was already doomed, she told him.He didnt agree or disagree.The night I disappeared, she whispered, you told me you were worried sick  you said you called every hospital in town, contacted the police.I didnt know what to think  when you didnt come home, I was afraid something had happened to you.I nearly had an accident  Even now she remembered slamming on the brakes, narrowly escaping being hit by a large truck, skidding to a stop and shaking so badly she knew she was in no condition to drive.I could have been killed, she whispered.It might have been better if I had been.The only outward evidence Roy showed of having heard her was slowing down to a near crawl.The driver behind them blasted his horn and Roy immediately picked up speed again.Dont say things like that, he demanded.It would be easier than living through this hell.Maggie.Dont worry, Roy, Im not going to do anything stupid.And she wouldnt.One impulsive act and she was about to lose her marriage.She wouldnt fight Roy.Hed made his position clear and so had she.While he might declare his undying love, commitment, and devotion to her, he was willing to walk rather than travel this journey with her.When he pulled into the parking lot at the inn, Maggie was surprised.Lost in her own world and her thoughts of the future, she hadnt paid attention to the landscape.She didnt have a clue they were back at the inn until he turned off the engine.Roy continued sitting in the car, but Maggie couldnt get out of it fast enough.Her husband remained inside as she hurried toward the front steps.The best thing for her to do now, she decided, was to pack up her things and leave.Driving back to Yakima with Roy would be intolerable.As far as she could tell, everything that had to be said had already been spoken.Her steps were slow and her vision blurred by tears as she climbed the porch steps.She paused and leaned against the porch column when unbearable grief struck her.Pressing a hand over her heart, she inhaled a deep breath and drew on her inner strength as she righted herself and continued into the house.As soon as she let herself in the front door, Jo Marie appeared.I see youre back.How was your she asked cheerfully, and then stopped abruptly.Maggie, is everything all right?Youre so pale.She managed a weak smile and shook her head.Are you ill?Do you need the name of a doctor?Theres a good medical clinic here   No.Its fine, she assured the other woman.Wheres Roy?Maggie didnt answer.She didnt know how to answer.He might still be sitting in the car.For all she knew he could have driven off and left her for good.She climbed the stairs one at a time; putting one foot in front of another was all she could manage.By the time she reached the top of the first flight, she was breathless.Grief weighed her down, but pride carried her toward their room.Jo Marie stood at the bottom of the stairs, watching her, concern written on her face.Maggie went into the room and closed the door.Her suitcase was in the closet.She took it out and packed her things, which took only a few minutes.What she needed, she decided, was to escape, to get away.But not like she had before.It felt as if the walls were closing in around her, as if the room was growing smaller with every breath she inhaled, until she could bear it no longer.Not knowing what to do or where she would go, Maggie stood, her legs wobbly.It came to her that she would need her purse.Funny the things that came into her mind.She opened it and removed the room key and placed it on the mattress.The key would no longer be necessary.Nor was her wedding band, which she removed and placed on the nightstand on top of the novel her husband had been reading.Then there was the letter, the love letter Roy had written her while in college, the one that claimed he would always love her.No need for her to keep that any longer, either.Removing the letter from the envelope, Maggie set it on the pillow and then went into the small bathroom and washed her face.When she came out of the room, Jo Marie remained at the foot of the stairs.Maggie, she said, her voice heavy with concern.Is there anything I can do?She shook her head.Im pregnant, she whispered.Jo Marie hugged her.Im thinking this isnt a happy discovery.Not for my husband.Jo Marie held her look.He drove off.I thought he might  hell be back, she assured the innkeeper.Jo Marie followed her to the door.Where are you going?she asked.What should I tell Roy?Dont tell him anything  I wont be back.Once again she managed a smile.Thank you for everything  the inn is lovely, and so are you.And that was all she had to say.26     I felt sick at heart.Something was drastically wrong between Maggie and Roy for her to leave the way she had, dragging her suitcase, her shoulders slumped as if every step was a burden too heavy for one soul to carry.When I hurried after her to ask if she needed a ride, she shook her head.I persisted and asked if she knew where she was headed.She didnt have an answer for me; she said she wasnt sure where she would go.I tried to talk some sense into her, but it did no good.I followed her halfway up the driveway and realized I wasnt going to be able to change her mind.The worst part of it was that by the time she left, Roy had, too.He hadnt returned, and the only phone number I had was Maggies cell, so I had no way of reaching him to explain what had happened to his wife.Maggie was pregnant.Apparently, this was unwelcome news to have caused such a drastic reaction.I wanted to help, but I wasnt sure I could or if I should even try.This was the area of being an innkeeper that was most unfamiliar to me.I didnt want to intrude or overstep my bounds, but at the same time I wanted to be helpful.If what was happening to Maggie and Roy wasnt enough of a concern, there was Ellie and her mother.Virginia had rented a room, and shortly thereafter Ellie and her mother had sat outside, talking intently.Their body language told me they wanted nothing more than to be left alone.I didnt know who or what they were discussing but guessed this had something to do with Tom.My presence wasnt appreciated, and so Rover and I left them to their own devices.My first thought was to retreat to the covered area on the side yard, where I often sat in the cool of the evenings.The three sided structure was part of an outbuilding from a homestead that dated back long before the inn was built.The Frelingers, the previous owners, had made it into a cozy retreat.Many a night Id sat out there and started a fire in the fireplace.This spot held a special significance to me, as it was in that very place where I first felt Pauls presence with me.It was cooler there, shaded from the sun by the shake roof, and would have been ideal if not for one thing.Mark was back.He was in the yard where I wanted the gazebo built and was busy doing something there.I was fairly certain he didnt see me, which was just as well.If I ventured out it was sure to invite conversation, and frankly, I wasnt in the mood for company; to be exact, I wasnt eager for Marks company.Our talk from earlier that afternoon weighed on my mind.As much as I didnt want to admit it, he was right.I had been in a cleaning frenzy lately, rearranging cupboards, organizing my spices, sorting through my bedroom drawers.He was right about something else, too.This restlessness had to be connected to the desolation of accepting my husbands death.I realized that Id grown uncomfortable dealing with my grief and so Id ignored it by pretending all was well.Id gotten so good at it that itd become second nature now.The cleaning had become a distraction, as had my curiosity regarding Marks mysterious background.Id been determined to dig up whatever I could find on him because if I concentrated on him then I wouldnt have to think about what was really on my mind.And that was the death of my husband.Mark stayed only a few minutes.He seemed to find what he wanted and left.He didnt give any indication that he had seen me, though I suspected that at some point he must have.Apparently, he realized I needed time to myself as well.After a few minutes I retreated to my own room.Rover followed me inside my private quarters and settled down on the rug in front of the fireplace, which was one of his favorite spots.Early on, Id decided to knit afghans for each one of the guest rooms, but it was much too hot to knit.I had other projects on needles, but knitting didnt appeal to me at the moment.I felt at loose ends, ill at ease in my own home.The restlessness was back, and I found myself pacing the confines of my bedroom, rubbing my palms together, anxious and rattled.Being agitated by Mark and then deeply concerned about my guests didnt help matters.Desperate to find a way to distract myself, I reached for the novel Id started earlier in the week and put my feet up, forcing my body to relax.It didnt work.I did my best to get involved in the story, but after a few pages I gave up.My mind wandered like a nomad, traveling from one area of interest to another.I should unload the dishwasher, and then I remembered that Id done that earlier.Wasnt there wash that needed to be loaded into the machine?That, too, had been accomplished.I supposed I could bake something.I found comfort in baking, but why would I take on that task in the hottest part of the afternoon?My mind might as well have been playing hopscotch.I must have slammed the book shut because Rover leaped to his feet, looking dazed and startled.Sorry, boy, I said.I dont know whats wrong with me.It would be all too easy to blame Mark, and I considered it.Deep down, I recognized it was more than Mark or even my guests troubles.What Mark claimed was eating at me like ants on honey.Rover walked over to my side of the bed and remained there.He focused his gaze on me as if he was trying to tell me something important.What is it, Rover?I asked, slightly impatient.Hed been outside earlier, so I knew that wasnt it.Obviously I didnt expect him to answer, but the two of us had developed strong communication skills.As crazy as it seemed, I could usually figure out what he wanted to tell me.After a couple minutes Rover turned his focus to my nightstand.That was odd; it wasnt like I kept doggie treats in my bedroom.I couldnt imagine what Rover would want from there.I walked over to his side and sat on the edge of the bed; the mattress sank with my weight.Running my hand down his sleek back, I exhaled a deep breath and opened the drawer  and froze.Inside was Pauls last letter to me.The one hed written in case of his death.A love letter that had come to me from the grave.Id refused to read it when it first arrived because I hadnt gotten final verification that my husband was dead.For more than a year I held on to the hope, the belief that when his helicopter went down in Afghanistan that somehow Paul had found a way to survive.It took a year for the remains to be located, and then, as fate would have it, not all the bodies were recovered.For a while I clung to the possibility, an irrational hope, that allowed me to believe my husband was alive.That died a swift death when Pauls remains were found and positively identified.Then and only then did I force myself to read the letter.Blind with grief, I can barely remember what he wrote.It was what I had expected him to say, I remembered that.Be happy for what we had, get on with your life, et cetera.I read the letter only the one time and then immediately placed it in the drawer on my nightstand.For months Id chosen to ignore it, to pretend it wasnt there simply because reading his last words to me would bring me more pain than comfort.I glanced at Rover and saw that hed lain back down again.Pauls letter was in my hand, and I looked down on the plain white envelope.My stomach muscles convulsed as I removed the handwritten sheets.I noticed that my hand shook, too.Emotion gripped my throat, and for a moment it was all I could do to continue breathing.My dearest Jo Marie, I read.Paul had never called me his dearest before, and I paused to take in the significance of this, if there was any.If youre reading this letter, it means the worst has happened and Ive been killed in action.Before we met and married, I wasnt overly concerned with the future.I knew the risks when I agreed to become a soldier and there was only my father and a few good friends to grieve or care if I lived or died.There was a certain freedom in that for me, a lack of fear; planning for the future was of little importance.I concentrated on my duty and decided to accept whatever happened without giving it a great deal of forethought.Then I met and fell in love with you.I never expected to meet a woman I could love the way I do you.A whole new world opened up to me with you.A world filled with possibilities and promises.For the first time in a long while I thought about having a home, a real home, and, God willing, raising two or three children.Loving you gave me permission to dream, to look beyond the day, to hope that life held more for me than war and being a soldier.You were a gift to me, Jo Marie.An unexpected, joyful gift I treasure more than my feeble heart or mere words could ever express.You brought me laughter and joy, and for that I will be eternally grateful.Soon after we married, Paul and I had talked about starting a family.Wed hoped Id get pregnant right away, but it wasnt meant to be.With his death, that dream had died along with so many others.I swallowed tightly and forced myself to continue reading.Like I said, if youre reading this, those dreams have turned to ash for us both.
