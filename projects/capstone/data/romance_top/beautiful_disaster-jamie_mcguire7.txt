Ithink I need a drink, I said, walking into the kitchen.Travis chuckled, watching me rifle through the cabinets.He was kidding, Pidge.I was?Shepley asked.He wasnt talking about anytime soon, Travis hedged.He turned to Shepley and grumbled, Thanks a lot, asshole.Maybe youll quit talking about it, now, Shepley grinned.I poured a shot of whiskey into a glass and jerked my head back, swallowing it all at once.My face compressed as the liquid burned down my throat.Travis gently wrapped his arms around my middle from behind.Im not proposing, Pidge.Theyre tattoos.I know, I said, nodding my head as I poured another drink.Travis pulled the bottle from my hand and twisted the cap on, shoving it back into the cabinet.When I didnt turn around, he pivoted my hips so that I would face him.Okay.I should have talked to you about it first, but I decided to buy the couch, and then one thing led to another.I got excited.This is very fast for me, Travis.Youve mentioned moving in together, you just branded yourself with my name, youre telling me you love methis is all veryfast.Travis frowned.Youre freakin out.I told you not to freak out.Its hard not to!You found out about my dad and everything you felt before has suddenly been amplified!Whos your dad?Shepley asked, clearly unhappy about being out of the loop.When I didnt acknowledge his question, he sighed.Whos her dad?he asked America.America should her head dismissively.Travis expression twisted with disgust.My feelings for you have nothing to do with your dad.Were going to this date party tomorrow.Its supposed to be this big deal where were announcing our relationship or something, and now you have my name on your arm and this proverb talking about how we belong to each other!Its freaky, okay?Im freaked out!Travis grabbed my face and planted his mouth on mine, and then he lifted me off the floor, setting me on the counter.His tongue begged entrance into my mouth, and when I let him in, he moaned.His fingers dug into my hips, pulling me closer.You are so fucking hot when youre mad, he said against my lips.Okay, I breathed, Im calm.He smiled, pleased that his plan of distraction had worked.Everythings still the same, Pidge.Its still just you and me.You two are nuts, Shepley said, shaking his head.America playfully smacked Shepleys shoulder.Abby bought something for Travis today, too.America!I scolded.You found a dress?he asked, smiling.Yeah, I wrapped my legs and arms around him.Tomorrow its going to be your turn to be freaked out.Im looking forward to it, he said, pulling me off the counter.I waved to America as Travis carried me down the hall.Friday after class, America and I spent the afternoon downtown, primping and indulging.We had our nails and toes done, errant hairs waxed, skin bronzed and hair highlighted.When we returned to the apartment, every surface had been covered with bouquets of roses.Reds, pinks, yellows, and whites  it looked like a floral shop.Oh my God!America squealed when she walked through the door.Shepley looked around him, standing proud.We went to buy you two flowers, but neither of us thought just one bouquet would do it.I hugged Travis.You guys areyoure amazing.Thank you.He smacked my backside.Thirty minutes until the party, Pidge.The boys dressed in Travis room while we slipped on our dresses in Shepleys.Just as I was fastening my silver heels, someone knocked on the door.Time to go, ladies, Shepley said.America walked out, and Shepley whistled.Where is she?Travis asked.Abbys having some trouble with her shoe.Shell be out in just a sec, America explained.The suspense is killin me, Pigeon!Travis called.I walked out, fidgeting with my dress while Travis stood in front of me, blank faced.America elbowed him and he blinked.Holy shit.Are you ready to be freaked out?America asked.Im not freaked out, she looks amazing, Travis said.I smiled and then slowly turned around to show him the steep dip of the fabric in the back of the dress.Okay, now Im freakin out, he said, walking over to me and turning me around.You dont like it?I asked.You need a jacket.He jogged to the rack and then hastily draped my coat over my shoulders.She cant wear that all night, Trav, America chuckled.You look beautiful, Abby, Shepley said as an apology for Travis behavior.Travis expression was pained as he spoke.You do.You look incrediblebut you cant wear that.Your skirt iswow, your legs areyour skirt is too short and its only half a dress!It doesnt even have a back on it!I couldnt help but smile.Thats the way its made, Travis.Do you two live to torture each other?Shepley frowned.Do you have a longer dress?Travis asked.I looked down.Its actually pretty modest in the front.Its just the back that shows off a lot of skin.Pigeon, he winced with his next words, I dont want you to be mad, but I cant take you to my frat house looking like that.Ill get in a fight the first five minutes were there, Baby.I leaned up on the balls of my feet and kissed his lips.I have faith in you.This night is gonna suck, he groaned.This night is going to be fantastic, America said, offended.Just think of how easy it will be to get it off later, I said, kissing his neck.Thats the problem.Every other guy there will be thinking the same thing.But youre the only one that gets to find out, I lilted.He didnt respond, and I leaned back to assess his expression.Do you really want me to change?Travis scanned my face, my dress, my legs, and then exhaled.No matter what you wear, youre gorgeous.I should just get used to it, now, right?I shrugged and he shook his head.All right, were already late.Lets go.I huddled next to Travis for warmth as we walked from the car to the Sigma Tau house.The air was smoky, but warm.Music boomed from the basement, and Travis bobbed his head to the beat.Everyone seemed to turn at once.I wasnt sure if they were staring because Travis was at a date party, or because he was wearing slacks, or because of my dress, but they were all staring.America leaned over to whisper in my ear.Im so glad youre here, Abby.I feel like I just walked into a Molly Ringwald movie.Glad I could help, I grumbled.Travis and Shepley took our coats, and then led us across the room to the kitchen.Shepley took four beers out of the fridge and handed one to America, and then to me.We stood in the kitchen, listening to Travis frat brothers discuss his last fight.The sorority sisters accompanying them happened to be the same busty blondes that followed Travis into the cafeteria the first time we spoke.Lexie was easy to recognize.I couldnt forget the look on her face when Travis pushed her from his lap for insulting America.She watched me with curiosity, seeming to study my every word.I knew she was curious why Travis Maddox apparently found me irresistible, and I found myself making an effort to show her.I kept my hands on Travis, inserting clever quips at precise moments of conversation, and joked with him about his new tattoos.Dude, you got your girls name on your wrist?What in the hell possessed you to do that?Brad said.Travis proudly turned over his hand to reveal my name.Im crazy about her, he said, looking down at me with soft eyes.You barely know her, Lexie scoffed.He didnt take his eyes from mine.We spend every second together.I know her.He furrowed his brow, I thought the tat freaked you out.Now youre bragging about it?I leaned up to kiss his cheek and shrugged.Its growing on me.Shepley and America made their way downstairs and we followed, hand in hand.Furniture had been pushed along the walls for a make shift dance floor, and just as we descended the stairs, a slow song began to play.Travis didnt hesitate to pull me into the middle, holding me close and pulling my hand to his chest.Im glad Ive never went to one of these things before.Its right that Ive only brought you.I smiled and pressed my cheek against his chest.He held his hand against my lower back, warm and soft against my bare skin.Everyones staring at you in this dress, he said.I looked up, expecting to see a tense expression, but he was smiling.I guess its kinda coolbeing with the girl everyone wants.I rolled my eyes.They dont want me.Theyre curious why you want me.And anyway, I feel sorry for anyone that thinks they have a chance.I am hopelessly and completely in love with you.A pained look shadowed his face.You know why I want you?I didnt know I was lost until you found me.I didnt know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed.Youre the one thing Ive got right.Youre what Ive been waiting for, Pigeon.I reached up to take his face between my hands and he wrapped his arms around me, lifting me off the floor.I pressed my lips against his, and he kissed me with the emotion of everything hed just said.It was in that moment that I realized why hed gotten the tattoo, why he had chosen me, and why I was different.It wasnt just me, and it wasnt just him, it was what we were together that was the exception.A faster beat vibrated the speakers, and Travis lowered me to my feet.Still wanna dance?America and Shepley appeared beside us and I raised an eyebrow.If you think you can keep up with me.Travis smirked.Try me.I moved my hips against his and ran my hand up his shirt, unfastening his top two buttons, Travis chuckled and shook his head, and I turned around, moving against him to the beat.He grabbed my hips and I reached around, grabbing his backside.I leaned forward and his fingers dug into my skin.When I stood up, he touched his lips to my ear.Keep that up and well be leaving early.I turned around and smiled, throwing my arms around his neck.He pressed himself against me and I un tucked his shirt, slipping my hands up his back, pressing my fingers into his lean muscles, and then smiling at the noise he made when I tasted his neck.Jesus, Pigeon, youre killin me, he said, gripping the hem of my skirt, pulling it up just enough to graze my thighs with his fingertips.I guess we know what the appeal is, Lexie sneered from behind us.America spun, stomping toward Lexie on the warpath.Shepley grabbed her just in time.Say it again!America said.I dare you, bitch!Lexie cowered behind her boyfriend, shocked at Americas threat.Better get a muzzle on your date, Brad, Travis warned.Two songs later, the hair on the back of my neck was heavy and damp.Travis kissed the skin just below my ear.Cmon, Pidge.I need a smoke.He led me up the stairs, and then grabbed my coat before leading me up to the second floor.We walked out onto the balcony to find Parker and his date.She was taller than I, her short, dark hair flat and pinned back with a single bobby pin.I noticed her pointy stilettos immediately, with her leg hooked around Parkers hip.She stood with her back against the brick, and when Parker noticed us walk out, he pulled his hand from underneath her skirt.Abby, he said, surprised and breathless.Hey, Parker, I said, stifling a laugh.How, uhhow have you been?I smiled politely.Ive been great, you?Uh, he looked at his date, Abby this is Amber.AmberAbby.Abby Abby?she asked.Parker gave one quick, uncomfortable nod.Amber shook my hand with a disgusted look on her face, and then eyed Travis as if she had just encountered the enemy.Nice to meet youI guess.Amber, Parker warned.Travis laughed once and then opened the doors for them to walk through.Parker grabbed Ambers hand and retreated into the house.That wasawkward, I said, shaking my head as I folded my arms, leaning against the railing.It was cold, and there were only a handful of couples outside.Travis was all smiles.Not even Parker could dampen his mood.At least hes moved on from trying his damndest to get you back.I dont think he was trying to get me back so much as trying to keep me away from you.Travis wrinkled his nose.He took one girl home for me once.Now he acts like hes made a habit of swooping in and saving every freshman I bagged.I gave him a wry look from the corner of my eye.Did I ever tell you how much I loathe that word?Sorry, he said, pulling me to his side.He lit his cigarette and took a deep breath.The smoke he blew out was thicker than usual, mixing with the winter air.He turned his hand over and took a long look at his wrist.How weird is it that this tat isnt just my new favorite, but it makes me feel at ease to know its there?Pretty weird.Travis raised an eyebrow and I laughed.Im kidding.I cant say I understand it, but its sweetin a Travis Maddox sort of way.If it feels this good to have this on my arm, I cant imagine how its going to feel to get a ring on your finger.Travis.In four, or maybe five years, he added.I took a breath.We need to slow down.Way, way down.Dont start this, Pidge.If we keep going at this pace, Im going to be barefoot and pregnant before I graduate.Im not ready to move in with you, Im not ready for a ring, and Im certainly not ready to settle down.Travis gripped my shoulders and turned me to face him.This isnt the I wanna see other people speech, is it?Because Im not sharing you.No fucking way.I dont want anyone else, I said, exasperated.He relaxed and released my shoulders, gripping the railing.What are you saying, then?he asked, staring across the horizon.Im saying we need to slow down.Thats all Im saying.He nodded, clearly unhappy.I touched his arm.Dont be mad.It seems like we take one step forward and two steps back, Pidge.Every time I think were on the same page, you put up a wall.I dont get itmost girls are hounding their boyfriends to get serious, to talk about their feelings, to take the next step.I thought we established that Im not most girls?He let his head drop, frustrated.Im tired of guessing.Where do you see this going, Abby?I pressed my lips against his shirt.When I think about my future I see you.Travis relaxed, pulling me close.We both watched the night clouds move across the sky.The lights of the school dotted the darkened block, and party goers folded their arms against thick coats, scurrying to the warmth of the brick and mortar of the fraternity house.I saw the same peace in Travis eyes that I had witnessed only a handful of times, and it hit me that just like the other nights, his content expression was a direct result of reassurance from me.I had experienced insecurity, those living one stroke of bad luck to the other; men who were afraid of their own shadow.It was easy to be afraid of the dark side Vegas, the side the neon and glitter never seemed to touch.But Travis Maddox wasnt afraid to fight, or to defend someone he cared about, or to look into the humiliated and angry eyes of a scorned woman.He could walk into a room and stare down someone twice his size, believing that no one could touch him  that he was invincible to anything that tried make him fall.He was afraid of nothing.Until hed met me.I was the one part of his life that was unknown, the wild card, the variable he couldnt control.Regardless of the moments of peace I had given him, in every other moment of every other day, the turmoil he felt without me was made ten times worse in my presence.The anger that took hold of him before was only becoming harder for him to manage.Being the exception was no longer a mysterious, special thing.I had become his weakness.Just as I was to my father.Abby!There you are!Ive been looking all over for you!America said, bursting through the door.She held up her cell phone.I just got off the phone with my dad.Mick called them last night.Mick?My face screwed into disgust.Why would he call them?America raised her eyebrows as if I should know the answer.Your mother kept hanging up on him.What did he want?I said, feeling sick.She pressed her lips together.To know where you were.They didnt tell him, did they?Americas face fell.Hes your father, Abby.Dad felt he had a right to know.Hes going to come here, I said, feeling my eyes burn.Hes going to come here, Mare!I know!Im sorry!she said, trying to hug me.I pulled away from her and covered my face with my hands.A familiar pair of strong, protective hands rested on my shoulders.He wont hurt you, Pigeon, Travis said.I wont let him.Hell find a way, America said, watching me with heavy eyes.He always does.I have to get out of here.I pulled my coat around me and pulled at the handle of the french doors.I was too upset to slow down long enough to coordinate pushing down the handle while pulling at the door at the same time.Just as frustrated tears fell down my frozen cheeks, Travis hand covered mine.He pressed down, helping me to push the handle, and then with his other hand, he pulled open the door.I looked at him, conscious of the ridiculous scene I was making, expecting to see a confused or disapproving look on his face, but he looked down at me only with understanding.Travis took me under his arm and we went through the house, down the stairs and through the crowd to the front door.The three of them struggled to keep up with me as I made a bee line for the Charger.Americas hand shot out and grabbed my coat, stopping me in my tracks.Abby!she whispered, pointing to a small group of people.They were crowded around an older, disheveled man who pointed frantically to the house, holding up a picture.The couples were nodding, discussing the photo among one another.I stormed over to the man and pulled the photo from his hands.What in the hell are you doing here?The crowd dispersed, walking into the house, and Shepley and America stood on each side of me.Travis cupped my shoulders from behind.Mick looked at my dress and clicked his tongue in disapproval.Well, well, Cookie.You can take the girl out of Vegas.Shut up.Shut Up, Mick.Just turn around, I pointed behind him, and go back to where ever you came from.I dont want you here.I cant, Cookie.I need your help.What else is new?America sneered.Mick narrowed his eyes at America and then looked to me.You look awful pretty.Youve grown up.I wouldntve recognized you on the street.I sighed, impatient with the small talk.What do you want?He held up his hands and shrugged.I seemed to have gotten myself in a pickle, kiddo.Old Dad needs some money.I closed my eyes.How much?I was doing good, I really was.I just had to borrow a bit to get ahead andyou know.I know, I snapped.How much do you need?Twenty five.Well shit, Mick, twenty five hundred?If youll get the hell outta hereIll give that to you now, Travis said, pulling out his wallet.He means twenty five thousand, I said glaring at my father.Micks eyes scanned over Travis.Whos this clown?Travis eyebrows shot up from his wallet and I felt his weight lean into my back as he restrained himself.I can see, now, why a smart guy like yourself has been reduced to asking your teenage daughter for an allowance.Before Mick could speak, I pulled out my cell phone.Who do you owe this time, Mick?Mick scratched his greasy graying hair.Well, its a funny story, Cookie,  Who?I shouted.Benny.My mouth fell open and I took a step back, into Travis.Benny?You owe Benny?What in the hell were you.I took a breath, there was no point.I dont have that kind of money, Mick.He smiled.Something tells me you do.Well, I dont!Youve really done it, this time, havent you?I knew you wouldnt stop until you got yourself killed!He shifted, the smug grin on his face had vanished.How much ya got?I clenched my jaw.Eleven thousand.I was saving for a car.Americas eyes darted in my direction.Where did you get eleven thousand dollars, Abby?Travis fights, I said, my eyes boring into Micks.Travis pulled on my shoulders to look into my eyes.You made eleven thousand off my fights?When were you betting?Adam and I had an understanding, I said, unconcerned with Travis surprise.Micks eyes were suddenly animated.You can double that in a weekend, Cookie.You could get me the twenty five by Sunday, and Benny wont send his thugs for me.My throat felt dry and tight.Itll clean me out, Mick.I have to pay for school.Oh, you can make it back in no time, he said, waving his hand dismissively.When is your deadline?I asked.Monday mornin.Midnight, he said, unapologetic.You dont have to give him a fucking dime, Pigeon, Travis said, tugging on my arm.Mick grabbed my wrist.Its the least you could do!I wouldnt be in this mess if it werent for you!America slapped his hand away and then shoved him.Dont you dare start that shit again, Mick!She didnt make you borrow money from Benny!Mick looked at me with loathing in his eyes.If it werent for her, I woulda had my own money.You took everything from me, Abby.I have nothin!I thought time away from Mick would lessen the pain that came with being his daughter, but the tears flowing from my eyes said otherwise.Ill get your money to Benny by Sunday.But when I do, I want you to leave me the hell alone.I wont do this again, Mick.From now on, youre on your own, do you hear me?Stay.Away.He pressed his lips together and then nodded.Have it your way, Cookie.I turned around and headed for the car, hearing America behind me.Pack your bags, boys.Were going to Vegas.Travis set down our bags and looked around the room.This is nice, right?I glared at him and he raised his brow.What?I unzipped my suitcase and shook my head.Different strategies and the lack of time crowded my head.This isnt a vacation.You shouldnt be here, Travis.In the next moment he was behind me, crossing his arms around my middle.I go where you go.I leaned my head against his chest and sighed.I have to get on the floor.You can stay here or check out the strip.Ill see you later, okay?Im going with you.I dont want you there, Trav.A hurt expression weighted his face and I touched his arm.If Im going to win fourteen thousand dollars in one weekend, I have to concentrate.I dont like who Im going to be while Im at those tables, and I dont want you see it, okay?He brushed my hair from my eyes and kissed my cheek.Okay, Pidge.Travis waved to America as he left the room, and she approached me in the same dress she wore to the date party.I changed into a short gold number and slipped on a pair of heels, grimacing at the mirror.America pulled back my hair and then handed me a black tube.You need about five more coats of mascara, and theyre going to toss your I. D.  on sight if you dont slather on some more blush.Have you forgotten how this game is played?I snatched the mascara from her hand and spent another ten minutes on my makeup.Once I finished, my eyes began to gloss over.Dammit, Abby, dont cry, I said, looking up and dabbing under my eyes with a tissue.You dont have to do this, Abby.You dont owe him anything, she said, cupping my shoulders as I stood in front of the mirror one last time.He owes Benny money, Mare.If I dont, theyll kill him.Her expression was one of pity.I had seen her look at me that way many times before, but this time she was desperate.Shed seen him ruin my life more times than either of us could count.What about the next time?And the next time?You cant keep doing this.He agreed to stay away.Mick Abernathy is a lot of things, but hes no welcher.We walked down the hall and stepped into an empty elevator.You have everything you need?I asked, keeping the cameras in mind.America clicked her fake drivers license with her nails and smiled.The names Candy.Candy Crawford, she said in her flawless southern accent.I held out my hand.Jessica James.Nice to meet you, Candy.We both slipped on our sunglasses and stood stone faced as the elevator opened, revealing the neon lights and bustling of the casino floor.People moved in all directions from all walks of life.Vegas was heavenly hell, the one place you could find dancers in ostentatious feathers and stage makeup, prostitutes with insufficient yet acceptable attire, businessmen in luxurious suits, and wholesome families in the same building.We strutted down an aisle lined with red ropes, and handed a man in a red jacket our I. D. s.  He eyed me for a moment and I pulled down my glasses.Anytime today would be great, I said, bored.He returned our I. D. s and stood aside, letting us pass.We passed aisle after aisle of slot machines, the black jack tables, and then stopped at the roulette wheel.I scanned the room, watching the various poker tables, settling on the one with older gentlemen in the seats.That one, I said, nodding across the way.Start off aggressive, Abby.They wont know what hit em.No.Theyre old Vegas.I have to play it smart this time.I walked over to the table, using my most charming smile.Locals could smell a hustler from a mile away, but I had two things in my favor that covered the scent of any con: Youthand tits.Good evening, gentlemen.Mind if I join you?They didnt look up.Sure sweet cheeks.Grab a seat and look pretty.Just dont talk.I want in, I said, handing America my sunglasses.Theres not enough action at the black jack tables.One of the men chewed on his cigar.This is a poker table, Princess.Five card draw.Try your luck on the slot machines.I sat in the only empty seat, making a show of crossing my legs.Ive always wanted to play poker in Vegas.And I have all these chips, I said, setting my rack of chips on the table, and Im really good online.All five men looked at my chips and then at me.Theres a minimum ante, Sugar, the Dealer said.How much?Five hundred, Peach.ListenI dont want to make you cry.Do yourself a favor and pick out a shiny slot machine.I pushed forward my chips, shrugging my shoulders in the way a reckless and overly  confident girl might before realizing shed just lost her college fund.The men looked at each other.The Dealer shrugged and tossed in his own.Jimmy, he said, offering his hand.When I took it, he pointed at the other men.Mel, Pauly, Joe and thats Winks.I looked over to the skinny man chewing on a toothpick, and as predicted, he winked at me.I nodded and waited with fake anticipation as Jimmy dealt the first hand.I purposely lost the first two, but by the fourth hand, I was up.It didnt take as long for the Vegas veterans to figure me out as it did Thomas.You said you played online?Pauly asked.And with my dad.You from here?Jimmy asked.Wichita, I smiled.Shes no online player, Ill tell you that, Mel grumbled.An hour later, I had taken twenty seven hundred dollars from my opponents, and they were beginning to sweat.Fold, Jimmy said, throwing down his cards with a frown.If I didnt see it with my own eyes, I would have never believed, I heard behind me.America and I turned at the same time, and my lips stretched across my face in a wide smile.Jesse, I shook my head.What are you doing here?This is my place youre scamming, Cookie.What are you doing here?I rolled my eyes and turned to my suspicious new friends.You know I hate that, Jess.Excuse us, Jesse said, pulling me by the arm to my feet.America eyed me warily as I was ushered a few feet away.Jesses father ran the casino, and it was more than just a surprise that he had joined the family business.We used to chase each other down the halls of the hotel upstairs, and I always beat him when we raced elevators.He had grown up since Id seen him last.I remembered him as a gangly pre pubescent teenager; the man before me was a sharply dressed pit boss, not at all gangly and certainly all man.He still had the silky brown skin and green eyes I remembered, but the rest of him was a pleasant surprise.His emerald irises sparkled in the bright lights.This is surreal.I thought it was you when I walked by, but I couldnt convince myself that you would come back here.When I saw this Tinkerbell cleaning up at the vets table, I knew it was you.Its me, I smiled.You lookdifferent.So do you.Hows your dad?Retired, he smiled.How long are you here?Just until Sunday.I have to get back to school.Hey, Jess, America said, taking my arm.America, he chuckled.I should have known.You are each others shadow.If her parents ever knew that I brought her here, all that would have come to an end a long time ago.Its good to see you, Abby.Why dont you let me buy you dinner?he asked, scanning my dress.Id love to catch up, but Im not here for fun, Jess.He held out his hand and smiled.Neither am I.  Hand over your I. D.   My face fell, knowing I had a fight on my hands.Jesse wouldnt give into my charms so easily.I knew I would have to tell him the truth.Im here for Mick.Hes in trouble.Jesse shifted.What kind of trouble?The usual.I wish I could help.We go way back, and you know I respect your dad, but you know I cant let you cant stay.I grabbed his arm and squeezed.He owes Benny money.Jesse closed his eyes and shook his head.Jesus.I have until tomorrow.Im calling in a solid I owe you, Jesse.Just give me until then.He touched his palm to my cheek.Ill tell you whatif you have dinner with me tomorrow, Ill give you until midnight.I looked at America and then to Jesse.Im here with someone.He shrugged.Take it or leave it, Abby.You know how things are done hereyou cant have something for nothing.I sighed, defeated.Fine.Ill meet you tomorrow night at Ferraros if you give me until midnight.He leaned down and kissed my cheek.It was good to see you again.See you tomorrowfive oclock, all right?Im on the floor at eight.I smiled as he walked away, but it quickly faded when I saw Travis staring at me from the Roulette table.Oh shit, America said, tugging on my arm.Travis glared at Jesse as he passed, and then made his way to me.He shoved his hands in his pockets and glanced at Jesse, who was watching us from the corner of his eye.Who was that?I nodded in Jesses direction.That is Jesse Viveros.Ive known him a long time.How long?I looked back at the vet table.Travis, I dont have time for this.I guess he chucked the youth minister idea, America said, sending a flirtatious grin in Jesses direction.Thats your ex boyfriend?Travis asked, instantly angry.I thought you said he was from Kansas?I shot America an impatient glare and then took Travis chin in my hand, insisting on his full attention.He knows Im not old enough to be in here, Trav.He gave me until midnight.I will explain everything later, but for now I have to get back to the game, all right?Travis jaws fluttered under his skin, and then he closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.All right.Ill see you at midnight.He bent down to kiss me, but his lips were cold and distant.Good luck.I smiled as he melted into the crowd, and then I turned my attention to the men.Gentlemen?Have a seat Shirley Temple, Jimmy said.Well be making our money back, now.We dont appreciate being hustled.Do your worst.I smiled, skillfully shuffling the cards and flicking them to each player with precision.You have ten minutes, America whispered.I know, I said.I sat at sixteen thousand.I tried to block out the time and Americas knee bobbing nervously under the table.The pot was at the nights all time high and it was all or nothing.Ive never seen anything like you, kid.Youve had almost a perfect game.And shes got no Tell, Winks.You notice?Pauly said.Winks nodded, his cheerful demeanor had evaporated a bit more with every hand.I noticed.Not a rub or a smile, even her eyes stay the same.Its not natural.Everybodys got a Tell.Not everybody, America said, smug.I felt a familiar pair of hands touch my shoulders.I knew it was Travis, but I didnt dare turn around, not with three thousand dollars sitting in the middle of the table.Call, Jimmy said.Those that had crowded around us applauded when I laid down my hand.Jimmy was the only one close enough to touch me with three of a kind.Nothing my straight couldnt handle.Unbelievable!Pauly said, throwing his two deuces to the table.Im out, Joe grumbled, standing up and stomping away from the table.Jimmy was a bit more gracious.I can die tonight and feel Ive played a truly worthy opponent, kiddo.Its been a pleasure, Abby.I froze.You knew?Jimmy smiled, the years of cigar smoke and coffee stained his large teeth.Ive played you before.Six years ago.Ive wanted a re match for a long time.Jimmy extended his hand.Take care, kid.Tell your dad Jimmy Pescelli says hello.America helped gather my winnings, and I turned to Travis, looking at my watch.I need more time.Wanna try the black jack tables?I cant lose money, Trav.He smiled.You cant lose, Pidge.America shook her head.Black Jacks not her game.Travis nodded.I won a little.Im up six hundred.You can have it.Shepley handed me his chips.I only made three.Its yours.I sighed.Thanks, guys, but Im still short five grand.I looked at my watch again and then looked up to see Jesse approaching.How did you do?he asked, smiling.Im five k short, Jess.I need more time.Ive done all I can, Abby.I nodded, knowing I had already asked too much.Thanks for letting me stay.Maybe I can get my dad to talk to Benny for you?Its Micks mess.Im going to ask him for an extension.Jesse shook his head.You know thats not going to happen, Cookie, no matter how much you come up with.If its less than what he owes, Bennys going to send someone.You stay as far away from him as you can.I felt my eyes burn.I have to try.Jesse took a step forward, leaning in to keep his voice low.Get on a plane, Abby.You hear me?I hear you, I snapped.Jesse sighed, and his eyes grew heavy with sympathy.He wrapped his arms around me and kissed my hair.Im sorry.If it wasnt my job at stake, you know Id try to figure something out.I nodded, pulling away from him.I know.You did what you could.He lifted my chin with his finger.Ill see you tomorrow at five.He bent down to kiss the corner of my mouth and then walked past me without another word.I glanced to America, who watched Travis.I didnt dare meet his eyes; I couldnt imagine what angry expression was on his face.Whats at five?Travis said, his voice dripping with subdued anger.She agreed to dinner if Jesse would let her stay.She didnt have a choice, Trav, America said.I could tell by the cautious tone of her voice that Travis was beyond angry.I peered up at him, and he glowered at me with the same betrayed expression Mick had on his face the night he realized Id taken his luck.You had a choice.Have you ever dealt with the mob, Travis?Im sorry if your feelings are hurt, but a free meal with an old friend isnt a high price to pay to keep Mick alive.I could see that Travis wanted to lash out at me, but there was nothing he could say.Cmon you guys, we have to find Benny, America said, pulling me by the arm.Travis and Shepley followed behind in silence as we walked down The Strip to Bennys building.The traffic  both cars and people on the thoroughfare  were just beginning to concentrate.With each step, I felt a sick, hollow feeling in my stomach, my mind racing to think of a compelling argument to make Benny see reason.By the time we knocked on the large green door I had seen so many times before, I had come up as short as my bank roll.It wasnt a surprise to see the enormous doorman  black, frightening, and as wide as he was tall  but I was stunned to see Benny standing beside him.Benny, I breathed.My, myyoure not Lucky Thirteen anymore, now, are ya?Mick didnt tell me what a looker youve grown into.Ive been waiting for you, Cookie.I hear you have a payment for me.I nodded and Benny gestured to my friends.I lifted my chin to feign confidence.Theyre with me.Im afraid your companions will have to wait outside, the doorman said in an abnormally deep bass tone.Travis immediately took me by the arm.Shes not going in there alone.Im coming with her.Benny eyed Travis and I swallowed.When Benny looked up to his doorman and the corners of his mouth turned up, I relaxed a bit.Fair enough, Benny said.Mick will be glad to know you have such a good friend with you.I followed him inside, turning to see the worried look on Americas face.Travis kept a firm grip on my arm, purposefully standing between me and the doorman.We followed Benny into an elevator, traveled up four floors in silence, and then the doors opened.A large mahogany desk sat in the middle of a vast room.Benny hobbled to his plush chair and sat down, gesturing for us to take the two empty seats facing his desk.When I sat down, the leather felt cold beneath me, and I wondered how many people had sat in that same chair, moments from their death.I reached over to grab Travis hand, and he gave me a reassuring squeeze.Mick owes me twenty five thousand.I trust you have the full amount, Benny said, scribbling something on a notepad.Actually, I paused, clearing my throat, Im five k short, Benny.But I have all day tomorrow to get that.And five thousand is no problem, right?You know Im good for it.Abigail, Benny said, frowning, You disappoint me.You know my rules better than that.PPlease, Benny.Im asking you to take the nineteen nine and Ill have the rest for you tomorrow.Bennys beady eyes darted from me to Travis and then back again.It was then that I noticed two men take a step forward from the shadowed corners of the room.Travis grip on my hand grew tighter, and I held my breath.You know I dont take anything but the full amount.The fact that youre trying to hand me less tells me something.You know what it tells me?That youre not sure if you can get the full amount.The men from the corners took another step forward.I can get your money, Benny, I giggled nervously.I won eighty nine hundred in six hours.So are you saying youll bring me eighty nine hundred in six more hours?Benny smiled his devilish grin.The deadline isnt until midnight tomorrow, Travis said, glancing behind us and then watching the approaching shadow men.WWhat are you doing, Benny?I asked, my posture rigid.Mick called me tonight.He said youre taking care of his debt.Im doing him a favor.I dont owe you any money.I said sternly, my survival instincts kicking in.Benny leaned both of his fat, stubby elbows onto his desk.Im considering teaching Mick a lesson, and Im curious just how lucky you are, kiddo.Travis shot up out of his chair, pulling me with him.He jerked me behind him, backing up toward the door.Josiah is outside the door, young man.Where exactly do you think youre going to escape to?I was wrong.When I was thinking about persuading Benny to see reason, I should have anticipated Micks will to survive, and Bennys penchant for retribution.Travis, I warned, watching Bennys henchmen approach us.Travis pushed me behind him a few feet and stood tall.I hope you know, Benny, that when I take out your men, I mean no disrespect.But Im in love with this girl, and I cant let you hurt her.Benny burst into a loud cackle.I gotta hand it to you, son.Youve got the biggest balls of anyone thats come through those doors.Ill prepare you for what youre about to get.The rather large fella to your right is David, and if he cant take you out with his fists, hes going to use that knife in his holster.The man to your left is Dane, and hes my best fighter.Hes got a fight tomorrow, as a matter of fact, and hes never lost.Mind you dont hurt your hands, Dane.Ive got a lot of money riding on you.Dane smiled at Travis with wild, amused eyes.Yes, sir.Benny, stop!I can get you the money!I cried.Oh nothis is going get interesting very fast, Benny chuckled, settling back into his seat.David rushed Travis and my hands flew up to my mouth.The man was strong, but clumsy and slow.Before David could swing or reach for his knife, Travis incapacitated him, shoving Davids face straight down into his knee.When Travis threw a punch, he wasted no time, throwing every bit of strength he had into the mans face.Two punches and an elbow later, David was lying on the floor in a bloody heap.Bennys head fell back, laughing hysterically and pounding his desk with the delight of a child watching Saturday morning cartoons.Well, go on, Dane.He didnt scare you, did he?Dane approached Travis more carefully, with the focus and precision of a professional fighter.His fist flew at Travis face with incredible speed, but Travis dodged, ramming his shoulder into Dane at full force.They fell against Bennys desk, and then Dane grabbed Travis with both arms, hurling him to the ground.They scuffled on the floor for a moment, and then Dane gained ground, positioning himself to get in a few punches on Travis while he was trapped beneath him on the floor.I covered my face, unable to watch.I heard a cry of pain, and then I looked up to see Travis hovering over Dane, holding him by his shaggy hair, jabbing punch after punch into the side of his head.Danes face rammed into the front of Bennys desk with each blow, and then he scrambled to his feet, disorientated and bleeding.Travis watched him for a moment, and then attacked again, grunting with every strike, once again using the full force of his strength.Dane dodged once and landed his knuckles to Travis jaw.Travis smiled and held up his finger.Thats your one.I couldnt believe my ears.Travis had let Bennys thug hit him.He was enjoying himself.I had never seen Travis fight without constraint; it was a bit frightening to see him unleash everything he had on these trained killers and have the upper hand.Until that moment, I hadnt realized just what Travis was capable of.With Bennys disturbing laughter in the background, Travis finished Dane off, landing his elbow in the center of Danes face, knocking him out before he hit the ground.I followed his body as it bounced once on Bennys imported rug.Amazing young man!Simply amazing!Benny said, clapping with delight.Travis pulled me behind him as Josiah filled the doorway with his massive frame.Should I take care of this, sir?No!No, no, Benny said, still giddy with the impromptu performance.What is your name?Travis was still breathing hard.Travis Maddox, he said, wiping Dane and Davids blood off of his hands and onto his jeans.Travis Maddox, I believe you can help your little girlfriend out.Hows that?Travis puffed.Dane was supposed to fight tomorrow night.I had a lot of cash riding on him, and it doesnt look like Dane will be fit to win a fight anytime soon.I suggest you take his place, make my bankroll for me, and Ill forgive the remaining fifty one hundred of Micks debt.Travis turned to me.Pigeon?Are you all right?I asked, wiping the blood from his face.I bit my lip, feeling my face crumple with a combination of fear and relief.Travis smiled.Its not my blood, Baby.Dont cry.Benny stood.Im a busy man, Son.Pass or play?Ill do it, Travis said.Give me the when and where and Ill be there.Youll be fighting Brock McMann.Hes no wallflower.He was barred from the UFC last year.Travis was unaffected.Just tell me where I need to be.Bennys sharks grin spread across his face.I like you, Travis.I think well be good friends.I doubt it, Travis said, opening the door for me and retaining a protective stance until we cleared the front door.Jesus Christ!America cried upon seeing the splattered blood covering Travis clothing.Are you guys okay?She grabbed my shoulders and scanned my face.Im okay.Just another day at the office.For both of us, I said, wiping my eyes.Travis grabbed my hand and we rushed to the hotel with Shepley and America close behind.Not many paid attention to Travis appearance.He was covered in blood and only the occasional out of towner seemed to notice.What in the hell happened in there?Shepley finally asked.Travis stripped down to his skivvies and disappeared into the bathroom.The shower turned on and America handed me a box of tissues.Im fine, Mare.She sighed and pushed the box at me once again.Youre not fine.This is not my first rodeo with Benny, I said, my muscles sore from how tense they had been the last twenty four hours.Its your first time to watch Travis go ape shit on someone, Shepley said.Ive seen it once before.Its not pretty.What happened?America insisted.Mick called Benny.Passed accountability onto me.Im gonna kill him!Im going to kill that sorry son of a bitch!America shouted.Hes not holding me responsible, but he was going to teach Mick a lesson for sending his daughter to pay off his debt.He called two of his damned dogs on us and Travis took them out.Both of them.In under five minutes.So Benny let you go?America asked.Travis appeared from the bathroom with a towel around his waist, the only evidence of his scuffle a small red mark on his cheek bone below his right eye.One of the guys I knocked out had a fight tomorrow night.Im taking his place and in return Benny will forgive the last five k Mick owes.America stood up.This is ridiculous!Why are we helping Mick, Abby?He threw you to the wolves!Im going to kill him!Not if I kill him, first, Travis seethed.Get in line, I said.So youre fighting tomorrow?Shepley asked.At a place called Zeros.Six oclock.Its Brock McMann, Shep.Shepley shook his head.No way.No fucking way, Trav.The guys a maniac!Yeah, Travis smiled, but hes not fighting for his girl, is he?Travis cradled me in his arms, kissing the top of my hair.You okay, Pigeon?This is wrong.This is wrong on so many levels.I dont know which one to talk you out of first.Did you not see me tonight?Im going to be fine.Ive seen Brock fight before.Hes tough, but not unbeatable.I dont want you to do this, Trav.Well, I dont want you to go to dinner with your ex boyfriend tomorrow night.I guess we both have to do something unpleasant to save your good for nothing father.I had seen it before.Vegas changed people, creating monsters and broken men.It was easy to let the lights and stolen dreams seep into your blood.I had seen the energized, invincible look on Travis face many times growing up, and the only cure was a plane ride home.I looked at my watch again.You have somewhere to be, Cookie?Jesse asked, amused.Please stop calling me that, Jess.I hate it.I hated it when you left, too.Didnt stop you.This is a tired, worn out conversation.Lets just have dinner, okay?Okay, lets talk about your new man.Whats his name?Travis?I nodded and he smiled.What are you doing with that tattooed psychopath?He looks like a reject from the Manson Family.Be nice, Jesse, or Im walking out of here.I cant get over how different you look.I cant get over that youre sitting in front of me.I rolled my eyes.Get over it.There she is, Jesse said.The girl I remember.I looked down at my watch.Travis fight is in twenty minutes.I better go.We still have dessert coming.I cant, Jess.I dont want him worrying if Im going to show up.Its important.His shoulders fell.I know.I miss the days when I was important.I rested my hand on his.We were just kids.That was a lifetime ago.When did we grow up?You being here is a sign, Abby.I thought Id never see you again and here you sit.Stay with me.I shook my head slowly, hesitant to hurt my oldest friend.I love him, Jess.His disappointment shadowed the small grin on his face.Then you better go.I kissed his cheek and fled the restaurant, catching a taxi.Where you headed?The cab driver asked.Zeros.The cabby turned to look at me, giving me a once over.You sure?Im sure!Go!I said, tossing cash over the seat.Travis finally broke through the crowd with Bennys hand on his shoulder, whispering in his ear.Travis nodded and replied, and my blood ran cold seeing him so friendly with the man that had threatened us less than twenty four hours before.Travis basked in the applause and congratulations of his triumph as the crowd roared.He walked taller, his smile was wider, and when he reached me, he planted a quick kiss on my mouth.I could taste the salty sweat mixed with the coppery taste of blood on his lips.He had won the fight, but not without a few battle wounds of his own.What was that about?I asked, watching Benny laugh with his cohorts.Ill tell you later.We have a lot to talk about, he said with a broad grin.A man patted Travis on the back.Thanks, Travis said, turning to him and shaking his outstretched hand.Looking forward to seeing another match of yours, Son, the man said, handing him a bottle of beer.That was incredible.Cmon, Pidge.He took a sip of his beer, swished it around in his mouth and then spit, the amber liquid on the ground tinged with blood.He weaved through the crowd, taking in a deep breath when we made it to the sidewalk outside.He kissed me once and then led me down The Strip, his steps quick and purposeful.In the elevator of our hotel, he pushed me against the mirrored wall, grabbed my leg and pulled it up in a quick motion against his hip.His mouth crashed into mine, and I felt the hand under my knee slide up my thigh and pull up my skirt.Travis, theres a camera in here, I said against his lips.I dont give a fuck, he chuckled, Im celebrating.I pushed him away.We can celebrate in the room, I said, wiping my mouth and looking down at my hand, seeing streaks of crimson.Whats wrong with you, Pigeon?You won, I won, we paid off Micks debt and I just got the offer of a lifetime.The elevator opened and I stood in place as Travis stepped out into the hall.What kind of offer?I asked.Travis reached out his hand, but I ignored it.My eyes narrowed, already knowing what he would say.He sighed.I told you, well talk about it later.Lets talk about it now.He leaned in and pulled me by the wrist into the hallway, and then lifted me off the floor into his arms.I am going to make enough money to replace what Mick took from you, to pay for the rest of your tuition, pay off my bike, and buy you a new car, he said, sliding the card key in and out of its slot.He pushed open the door and set me on my feet.And thats just the beginning!And how exactly are you going to do that?My chest tightened and my hands began to tremble.He took my face in his hands, ecstatic.Benny is going to let me fight here in Vegas.Six figures a fight, Pidge.Six figures a fight!I closed my eyes and shook my head, blocking out the excitement in his eyes.What did you say to Benny?Travis lifted my chin and I opened my eyes, afraid he had already signed a contract.He chuckled.I told him Id think about it.I exhaled the breath Id been holding.Oh, thank God.Dont scare me like that, Trav.I thought you were serious.Travis grimaced and steadied himself before he spoke.I am serious, Pigeon.I told him I needed to talk to you, first, but I thought youd be happy.Hes scheduling one fight a month.Do you have any idea how much money that is?Cash!I can add, Travis.I can also keep my senses when Im in Vegas, which you obviously cant.I have to get you out of here before you do something stupid.I walked over to the closet and ripped our clothes from the hangers, furiously stuffing them in our suitcases.Travis gently grabbed my arms and spun me around.I can do this.I can fight for Benny for a year and then well be set for a long, long time.What are you going to do?Drop out of school and move here?Bennys going to fly me out, work around my schedule.I laughed once, incredulous.You cant be that gullible, Travis.When youre on Bennys payroll, you arent just going to fight once a month for him.Did you forget about Dane?Youll end up being one of his thugs!He shook his head.We already discussed that, Pidge.He doesnt want me to do anything but fight.And you trust him?You know they call him Slick Benny around here!I wanted to buy you a car, Pigeon.A nice one.Both of our tuitions will be paid in full.Oh?The mob is handing out scholarships, now?Travis jaws clenched.He was irritated at having to convince me.This is good for us.I can sock it away until its time for us to buy a house.I cant make this kind of money anywhere else.What about your Criminal Justice degree?Youre going to be seeing your old classmates quite a bit working for Benny, I promise you.Baby, I understand your reservations, I do.But Im being smart about this.Ill do it for a year and then well get out and do whatever the hell we want.You dont just quit Benny, Trav.Hes the only one that can tell you when youre done.You have no idea what youre dealing with!I cant believe youre even considering this!Working for a man that would have beat the hell out of the both of us last night if you hadnt stopped him?Exactly.I stopped him.You stopped two of his light weight goons, Travis.What are you going to do if there are a dozen of them?What are you going to do if they come after me during one of your fights?It wouldnt make sense for him to do that.Ill be making him lots of money.The moment you decide youre not going to do that anymore, youre expendable.Thats how these people work.Travis walked away from me and looked out the window, the blinking lights coloring his conflicted features.He had made his decision before hed ever come to me about it.Its going to be all right, Pigeon.Ill make sure it is.And then well be set.I shook my head and turned around, shoving our clothes into our suitcases.When we set down on the tarmac at home, he would be his old self again.Vegas did strange things to people, and I couldnt reason with him while he was intoxicated with the flow of cash and whiskey.I refused to discuss it further until we were on the plane, afraid Travis would let me leave without him.I buckled my seat belt and clenched my teeth, watching him stare longingly out the window as we climbed into the night sky.He was already missing the wickedness and limitless temptations Vegas had to offer.Thats a lot of money, Pidge.No.His head jerked in my direction.This is my decision.I dont think youre looking at the big picture.I think youve lost your damn mind.Youre not even going to consider it?No, and neither are you.Youre not going to work for a murderous criminal in Las Vegas, Travis.Its completely ridiculous for you to think I could consider it.Travis sighed and looked out the window.My first fight is in three weeks.
