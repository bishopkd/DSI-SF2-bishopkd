Im exhausted.She paused.Your flat?You mean 						you know where it is?His brow wrinkled.Yes and no.I thought it was located on rue des Francs Bourgeois, but Dr.Carter 						informed me that we are not in Paris, but in New York.So I suppose the 						answer is no.I dont know where my flat is.He shrugged.Not that it 						matters.You know where I live, dont you?She tapped her own temple.If I 						knew where you lived, Brit, Id be droppin you off right now and thankin 						the good Lord for havin saved me from a guilt Ive no right to 						feel.He eyed her.I sense there is 						an animosity between us.Youd be sensin right, given 						what you wanted out of me before you earned that knock to your 					head.I see.He blew out a pained 						breath and muttered, I suppose that leaves me to find myself a hotel, as I 						am not one to perpetuate arguments I cannot even remember.He paused and 						glanced down at himself, patting his coat pockets.Did I not have a 						pocketbook?How am I to pay for anything?Dr.Carter gathered several 						ledgers from his desk, organizing them.Your pocketbook is already 						accounted for, Mr.Crusoe.How are you feeling?Aside from these damnable 						headaches, I feel remarkably well.Better.Good.Tis my hope that the 						headaches will fade in time.Try to rest.Dr.Carter rounded the desk with 						a stack of ledgers in hand.Now if youll both excuse me, I intend to 						retire early tonight and call upon an acquaintance of mine who happens to be 						the owner of the New York Evening 						Post.Perhaps we can get this story 						into tomorrows paper, seeing it has yet to print.Given its popularity, Im 						certain other newspapers will follow suit.Well commence there and hope for 						the best.He inclined his head and strode out of the office.Georgia swiveled toward the 						Brit, who quietly observed her with marked curiosity.His gaze drifted down 						the full length of her and paused on her boots, which peered out from 						beneath her ankle high skirts.The leather on your boots is 						almost white, he commented.You should buy yourself a new 					pair.He was like a child.How very 						observant.If only I could afford a new pair.Stepping toward him, Georgia 						grabbed up his gloved hand and pressed his satchel into it.This is yours, 						Brit.It has all of your money in it, so I suggest you keep it safe til we 						get across town.He hesitated, shifting the 						satchel in his hand before slipping it into the inner pocket of his gray 						coat.Why do you keep calling me Brit?Because thats what you are.A 						Brit.I would rather you call me 						Robinson.I dont like the way you say Brit.Not to disappoint you, 						Brit, but I 						usually call people whatever I want.Tis my born right as a United States 						citizen.I may not be able to vote, but no man is goin to tell me I cant 						use my tongue.Georgia paused and pointed to his sleeved coat, noting that 						the band was missing from his arm.You had a mournin band.Did you lose 						it?Or did you strip it?He glanced down at his arm.I 						was wearing amourning band?That you were.Right there on 						your arm.He glanced up, searching her 						face, his features taut and panicked.Who died?Georgias stomach dropped all 						the way down to her toes as she met his gaze.There was an aching 						vulnerability lingering within those handsome gray eyes that seemed to 						depend on her for everything.It made her want to give the man 						everything.She softened her tone.I dont 						know who died.All I know is that you were wearin one when I last saw 						you.He dug his gloved fingertips 						into the biceps of his right arm and winced.Why can I not 						remember?Try not to worry.Rememberin 						is overrated, anyway.Trust me.I wish there was a way I could forget half my 						life.She drifted closer, sighed and leaned toward him to get a better look 						at what needed to be stripped before they crossed into the other side of 						town.She fingered the sturdy material on the seam of his morning coat.The 						fine fabric had to be worth ten dollars without the stitching.Heavens, 						youre a walkin merchant cart waitin to be robbed.Well have to alter 						your appearance til were able to get rid of these clothes.He stiffened, lowering his gaze 						to her probing fingers.And what is wrong with my appearance or my 					clothes?Everythin.She sniffed, the 						heat of his muscled body wafting the subtle fragrance of tonic and penny 						shaving cream.I hate to say it, but you even smell wrong.He blinked rapidly.Are you 						suggesting that I bathe?Because I just did.Fifteen minutes 					ago.Nah, Im suggestin quite the 						opposite.I only bathe and scrub once every two days and even thats 						considered a bit much in the eyes of where I live.But then again, Im a 						woman and youre not.In my ward, if a man starts playin with too much soap 						and tonic, hes likely to get a reputation for wearin pink 					garters.I dont wear pink 						garters.I didnt say you did.But that 						wont keep the boys from sayin it.And you sure as hell dont want a byname 						with the word pink in it.Now lets get rid of some of these fineries, 						shall we?She tapped at his cravat.Off with it.He paused, his gaze trailing 						down to her lips.Does this mean there is no further need for a 						hotel?Georgia nervously smoothed her 						hands against the sides of her calico skirts, sensing he was still confused 						as to who she was.Wetting her lips, she chose her words carefully, hoping 						not to send him into a panic.I can only apologize for Dr.Carter.He means 						well, but it isnt right makin you think Im someone Im not.His brows flickered.I dont 						understand.Im not your wife or your 						mistress or whoever you think I am.The name is Georgia.You know, like the 						state.You can call me that, if you want, but I prefer Mrs.Milton until we 						get to know each other more.She gestured toward his throat.Now remove 						your cravat.He stared her down.If I ever 						decide to undress for you, Mrs.Milton, it wont be upon your command but 						mine.She glared at him.Oh, now, 						dont you get cheeky with me, Brit.Im not askin you to undress for my 						sake.Im askin you to undress for yours.We cant have you prancin 						about in silk over on Orange Street.Youll get dirked.Now take it 						off.He stepped back.Absolutely 						not.What would your husband say, Mrs.Milton?Her lips thinned.Perhaps it was 						best he thought Raymond was alive.It would keep him from thinking she was 						up for a toss.The man would say, for the good of your own breath, youd 						best take off the cravat.Oh, no, he wouldnt.He would 						say, If you take anything off in the presence of my wife, you will cease to 						breathe.She let out an exasperated 						laugh.As amusin as I find you and this, all omnis cease runnin in an 						hour.Do you want to walk fifteen blocks in the dark?I dont.Now take off 						the cravat.Even with it bein spattered with blood, it makes you look too 						much like a gentleman.I should probably point out 						that I consider myself to be a gentleman.She quirked a brow, challenging 						him.Really?Really.I thought you were a Sal 						pirate.Isnt that what you told Dr.Carter?He shifted his jaw and glanced 						away.I cannot trust what I do or do not remember.Which is why youll have to 						trust me over yourself, dear sir, because Im not the one sufferin from 						memory loss.He muttered something and 						scrubbed a hand through his hair.He winced, letting his hand fall back to 						his side.Remind me not to touch my head.Georgia softened her tone, 						hoping a motherly approach would get him to cooperate.We really ought to 						remove that silk from around your throat.Wont you take it off?For me?Please?Stepping closer, she reached up 						and forcefully unraveled his silk cravat, trying to figure out how the damn 						thing was supposed to come off.The fabric kept sliding against her fingers 						like cool water.Their gazes locked and she paused, trying to steady her 						breathing.He jerked outside of her tugging 						hands and shifted his broad shoulders, stepping back.Im not at all 						comfortable with you touching me.You are, after all, a very attractive woman 						and I would hate for this to progress beyond anything either of us would be 						able to control.She set her hands on her hips.What a cad.If I were lookin to progress things, Robinson, Id be goin 						straight for the trousers.Rest assured, a mans throat never once made me 						moan and I highly doubt yours will, either.He stared at her, his expression 						strained.Refrain from talking to me in such crass tones.I wouldnt have to talk 						at all if 						you were cooperatin.Now cease bein so damn stupid.Im here to help.She 						stepped back toward him, reached up and forcefully finished yanking his 						cravat off.She tossed it, letting it cascade to the floor.His gloved hand jumped up to 						cover his exposed throat, his shaven face flushing.I really dont 						understand why  Silk just isnt somethin men 						in my parts wear.Men there are poor.Some of them are very poor.Theres no 						need to give them a reason to hate or rob you.You bein an uppity Brit is 						goin to be bad enough.Men will probably fist you based on your accent 						alone.Oh, and you plan on taking me 						there?He lifted a brow.Shall I thank you for your overall lack of 						concern for me now?Or later?After I get fisted?She rolled her eyes.You 						neednt worry.Ill see to it you fall under the protection of the 						boys.The boys?He lowered his chin.You intend on placing me under the care of your children?I assure you, 						madam, my mind isnt that far gone.She gurgled out a laugh.He was 						so bizarrely adorable.Nah, it isnt like that at all.Though sometimes I 						do wonder.She glanced toward the open doorway and lowered her voice.Theyre men who act like boys, so I call them boys, see?Theyre known for 						havin a black reputation, and believe me, they live up to it, but I know 						how to yank their collars.Im just makin sure nothin happens to you prior 						to my yankin those collars.And who are these men to you?He eyed her.Are you involved with any of them?Not in that way, no.Theyre 						more like flea ridden dogs I cant get rid of.She scanned his clothes 						again and sighed.Ill have Matthew loan you some of his clothes.Youre 						about his size.Give or take a few stones.He squinted.Matthew?Who is 						that?Your husband?No.My son.His lips parted.You have a son 						my size?You dont appear to be a breath over twenty.She grinned, tilting her face up 						toward him.Thank you for that, but Im well over twenty.Im two and 					twenty.He scanned her face.That still 						doesnt make you old enough to have a son my size.He isnt really your son, 						is he?Not by birth, no.So whose boy is he?He leaned 						in, trailing his gaze to her lips.And why are you taking care of 						him?She stepped back.Dont look at 						my lips.He stepped toward her.I will 						keep looking at them until you tell me everything I want to 					know.She scrambled back, sensing that 						he wanted to do far more than look at them.Hes Raymonds boy.All right?Not mine.Raymonds.And who is Raymond?She glared at him.Im not 						about to tell my life story to a man who doesnt even know his own.Now give 						me your hand.She pointed.We cant have you wearin those 					gloves.He set both gloved hands behind 						his back and eyed her expectantly.I dont intend to cooperate until you 						tell me who Raymond is.The man is dead, she bit out.All right?Now cease actin like a bogey and give me your hand.She 						forcefully grabbed his arm and jerked it out from behind his back, tugging 						it up toward her.Digging her fingers beneath the cuff of his linen shirt, 						she peeled the fitted leather glove from his large hand and tossed it toward 						the desk.Without any resistance, he 						quietly watched her strip the glove from his other hand.His large and 						remarkably smooth hand tightened possessively around her own.She paused, entranced by the 						heat of his hand penetrating her skin.Her body seemed to drift, while her 						mind remained anchored and fully aware of him and that hand.There was 						something very different about his touch.Whilst incredibly firm and strong, 						it was alsosoft.Slowly turning his large palm upward, she ran the tips of 						her calloused fingers against the smoothest masculine palm shed ever 						encountered.It was as if he had never touched anything with those hands.Georgia glanced up.You most 						certainly arent a pirate.And how do you know?I could 						be.She lifted his hand and tilted 						it palm upward for him to better see.Look at your hands.He hesitated and lowered his 						gaze to the hand she held up.She traced her fingers toward 						the length of his long fingertips and back toward his large smooth palm.Theyre untouched.See?If you were a pirate, you would have handled ropes 						and crates, which would have covered your hands in calluses.Given their 						softness, tis obvious your only trade is money.She snorted.That would 						explain why you couldnt remember how to shave or knot a cravat.You had 						servants doin it for you.His mouth tightened as he tilted 						his hand against hers, intently observing it.They are smooth, arent 						they?He sounded disappointed.She gently shook his hand, not 						wanting him to feel shame in what he was.Im sorry.I didnt mean to make 						you feel bad.Tis a blessin, not a curse, I assure you.Tis also the 						truest mark of wealth there is.He glanced up.So I am a man of 						wealth?With hands like these and 						silver buttons to match, you most certainly are.She lowered her voice in 						warning, squeezing his hand.Whatever you do, though, Brit, dont tell 						anyone, and dont parade that money in your satchel.You cant be 						trustin anyone but me from here on out.You hear?His fingers curled and tightened 						around her hand, squeezing his warmth against her own.And who are you to 						me?A huskiness lingered in his uncertain tone as he searched her face.Why do you care?He reminded her so much of 						herself when she was younger, unwilling to trust but having no other choice 						but to trust.Although her only family, her dear da, had disappeared many 						years ago for reasons she would never know, shed see to it that this mans 						family didnt suffer in the way she had.Someone out there loved him and 						missed him, and she would ensure he was returned back into their arms where 						he belonged.Consider me a friend who 						understands what its like to be dependent on the love and generosity of 						others.She slid her hand from his and pointed to that double row of silver 						buttons.Those will have to come off, too.He glanced down at his 						waistcoat, his brows coming together.What?The buttons?Yes, the buttons.Theyre 						silver, arent they?I suppose they are.What of 						it?It means youre likely to be 						robbed of them.He fingered one of the buttons.But theyre attached to my waistcoat.Not for long they arent.Let 						me show you how its done over on my street.She yanked her full skirt up 						to the knee, exposing the leather holster attached to her thigh, and slid a 						small blade out before letting her skirts drop again.He stepped back, his eyes 						jumping toward the blade.What are you doing?Trust me.She grabbed his 						waist and dragged him back over toward herself.I only want the 						buttons.He grabbed hold of her wrist, 						twisting the blade hard and off to the side, away from himself.All I ask 						is that you keep it pointed away from me.Oh, cease your brayin.She 						jerked her wrist from his grasp, ignoring the sting.Firmly holding the top 						silver button away from the embroidered fabric of his waistcoat, she slashed 						the threads beneath it, catching the button with her other hand.He searched her face, the 						resistance in his body waning as the edge of his full mouth quirked.I like 						you.Oh, do you, now?she tossed up 						at him.Lets just see how long that lasts.Very few men like a woman with 						a quick tongue.Holding her gaze, his large 						hands curved around her waist, causing her to stiffen.He leaned in close, 						despite the blade in her hand pointing toward him, and asked softly and 						adoringly, Mrs.Milton, are you really married?Or are you 						pretending to be?Because I find you endearing.Tongue, mind and all.He 						paused and added, I also find you to be incredibly attractive.Incredibly.The man had apparently lost the 						last of his mind and his ability to censor his own thoughts.She lowered 						her gaze, the heat of those lingering hands making her stomach tingle.Im 						not married anymore, she admitted, her throat tightening at the thought of 						Raymond.I was, when I was younger, but he died.Ah.His hands drifted away 						from her hips.Did you love him?She edged back and half nodded.Yes.Very much.Im sorry for your 						loss.She half nodded again.Thank 						you.He was quiet for a long moment.Were you and he ever in Paris?Is that where I may know you 					from?She glanced up at him.Her and 						Raymond in Paris?Oh, now shed heard it all.Raymond hated the French about 						as much as he hated the mayor and his politics.Whilst she?She only knew 						about Paris from Raymond.About all the gardens the Parisians had, the rows 						of palaces that once belonged to kings, the way they cobbled their streets 						and even had churches that were almost as old as God himself.Raymond had 						been in Paris on business in his younger years when he still had money.As 						for me, Ive never once lived a breath outside of New York.I was born here, 						and though Im tryin to move west, Ill most likely die here and be buried 						with a wooden marker thatll rot away and make everyone forget I was born a 						redhead.He averted his gaze.You are 						far too young to be speaking in such gray tones.Where I live, gray is about the 						only color one sees.But one gets used to it, especially if its all they 						know.She focused once again on his waistcoat.Now hold still.She leaned in, working the blade 						against the threads behind each button.She quickly detached all the 						buttons, catching them in her palm one by one, until his waistcoat hung 						open, exposing the whitest and brightest linen shirt shed ever glimpsed.It 						was as if it had been snatched right off the tailors bench.She released him, shoving all 						six buttons into the stitched pocket just beneath her left arm.There.Gathering her calico skirts back 						up, she slid the blade securely back into the holster and let her skirts 						drop.She paused, sensing he was staring.Having been surrounded by men 						since she was nine, shortly after the death of her mum, shed lost all sense 						of modesty around those who were used to seeing limbs being bared and rarely 						stared.But this man made her aware of just how important modesty was.It 						kept a girl out of trouble when it counted most.She awkwardly glanced toward 						him.You didnt have to look.I couldnt very well help it.His jaw tightened as he met her gaze.Do you lift your skirts for all the 						boys?She pursed her lips, attempting 						not to be entirely insulted.Only the ones I intend to gut.So I suggest 						you mind your tongue.Dont you worry.I intend to 						mind my tongue and my eyes.He glanced away, jerking his now open 						waistcoat against his linen shirt and abdomen.I must say, the prodigal 						destruction of a perfectly good waistcoat brings this man to 					tears.She paused.The prodi what?Prodigal, he 					provided.And what is that supposed to 						mean?Wasteful.Prodigal means 						wasteful.Oh, does it, now?Well, I never 						heard of the word.And whose fault is that?Not 						mine, to be sure.Buy yourself a dictionary, my dear.She glared at him for being so 						rude.If I could afford one, I would.Though I really wouldnt be surprised 						if you just made that word up in some pathetic attempt to impress 						me.He raked a gaze down the length 						of her and smirked.I can think of a dozen other ways to go about 						impressing you, Mrs.Milton, and making up words doesnt readily come to 						mind.She squinted.You mean it 						really is a word?Yes, of course it is a 						word.Huh.She eyed him.Im 						confused.About what?The 					word?No.She waved toward him.How 						is it you remember prodi whatever but cant remember much else?He paused.That I dont know.He shrugged, averting his gaze.I just remember words, that is all.I see 						them.I hear them.I cannot readily explain why, but I do.And as I said, the 						prodigal 						destruction of a perfectly good waistcoat brings this man to 					tears.She lowered her chin.Before 						your tears flood this room and the city, I ought to point out that a silver 						button can be pawned for as much as seventy five cents apiece over at the 						local junk dealer.Over four dollars was dangling off your chest for the 						world to see.Never give anyone a reason to fleece you, I say, or they 						will.Stepping back, she eyed his appearance again.You still arent rough 						enough.You shouldnt have shaved.She bit her lip and glanced 						around, wondering what she could do without altogether ripping the seams of 						his outfit apart.She supposed she could soil it, but with what?She paused.Coffee.How 						fitting.Glancing toward Dr.Carters 						desk, she plucked up the porcelain cup of coffee hed left on the desk and 						dipped her finger into it to ensure it wasnt hot.It wasnt.I dont think 						Dr.Carter will mind.Hold still.Heres a toast to what should have been.Turning back to him, she flung the entire contents of the dark, gritty 						liquid onto the front of his linen shirt and open waistcoat.He sucked in a breath and jumped 						back, his hands popping up into the air.He frantically swiped at his wet, 						stained clothing and glared at her, his dark hair falling from its neat, 						brushed state.Damn you thrice into the pits of hell, woman.He gestured 						rigidly toward himself, his face taut and his eyes ablaze.Why did you 						think it necessary to ruin a perfectly fine linen shirt?He was certainly prim for a man 						who thought he was a pirate.He couldnt even swear right.Were 						improvisin, is all.No ones linen shirts look that snowy white where I 					live.He gave her a withering look.Forgive me for having a clean shirt.Shall I rip the seams a bit for 						you?She heaved out a breath.If you 						cant survive bein stripped by a woman and havin coffee thrown at you, you 						most certainly wont survive where Im takin you.Youre over six feet 						tall.Act like every inch counts, will you?Be a man.He released his shirt and 						stalked toward her, veering in tauntingly close.Tis damn well hard to be 						a man around you.Damn.Well.Hard.She rolled her eyes and huffed 						on her way out of the office.Men.They were all so 						self righteous no matter what their upbringing or how hard you hit them on 						the head.Of old there was nothing, nor 					sand, nor sea, nor cool waves.No earth, no heaven above.Only the yawning 						chasm.Saemundar Edda, Codex Regius (early 						fourteenth century) ROBINSON INTENTLY WATCHED the shadows of 						wood buildings as they bobbed and rolled by through the small dirt streaked 						window at his elbow, waiting to recognize just one thing.And yet he didnt.Not the buildings.Not the streets.Not the omni he rode in.Not even the 						night itself.It was as if he were looking out upon a chasm that meant 						nothing to him.How much longer would he have to live feeling as if he were 						seeing everything for the first time?He tightened his jaw and glanced 						toward the young woman sitting beside him on the bench.Georgia.Like the 						state.Who the hell named their daughter after a state?It would be like 						naming ones daughter after Paris.It bespoke of too much grandeur with very little 						to show.Her sloppily gathered strawberry 						locks quivered within her frayed, beribboned bonnet with each strong sway of 						the omni that sent her shoulder bumping into his shoulder.Despite the sways 						that forced their bodies to touch, she indifferently stared out across the 						narrow space toward the bench opposite their own, which had long been 						emptied of passengers.Something about her was so 						achingly familiar, but for some reason, it didnt match any of the erotic 						images she evoked in his head.He could vividly see pale, freckled limbs and 						cascading long red hair similar to hers splayed out against linen, but there 						simply wasnt a face associated with it.Who was the naked woman in his head 						if it wasnt this Georgia?Was it a wife he couldnt remember?Or 						amistress?God help him either 					way.He dragged in a breath.What do 						you know about me?he eventually inquired above the clattering of the wood 						wheels.Georgia shifted toward him.Her 						seductive eyes met his through the dim light of the lantern that swayed 						above the closed omni door, shifting shadows.I know as much about you as 						you know about yourself.Are you certain I never 						mentioned having a wife?You told me you had no 						wife.Oh.Had he lied to her?No.He 						wasnt that sort of man.Or rather, he could sense he wasnt that sort of man.He 						shifted closer to her on the bench, his thigh bumping hers.And how do we 						know each other again?We met on Broadway.You affixed 						one of the ribbons on my bonnet when it came loose and it led to a bit of 						conversation.Ah.And was I at least 						courteous and respectable toward you during our initial 					interaction?She eyed him.Courteous, you 						most certainly were.Respectable?Mmm.No.Not really.Not given the way you 						insisted I join you for coffee.You wouldnt leave me alone.He cleared his throat.There 						isnt anything wrong with a gentleman insisting on mere coffee, is 						there?If the coffee is at his hotel, 						Id say there is.He lowered his chin.I 						propositioned you?Right there on the street.She 						waggled her brows and nudged him.You practically poured coffee down my 						throat.What breed of a bastard ambushed 						a woman on the street and tried to drag her over to his hotel under the 						pretense of coffee?If he ever did remember being that sort of man, hed up 						and fist himself.I can only apologize for my behavior.Apology much appreciated and 						accepted.Scanning her full lips, Robinson 						tried to conjure a memory of what might have been.He would have remembered 						making love to a mouth like that, wouldnt he?But then again, he really 						couldnt remember making love to any mouth.It was alarming to know all 						about what went on between a man and a woman and yet not remember 						doing any 						of it aside from some random flash of nakedness belonging to God knows whom.So what happened between us?Did you and I ever?Her brows rose.What sort of 						woman do you take me for?I said no and sent you on your way, is what.You 						were the one followin me like a dog.He leaned toward her.If 						nothing happened between us, and you know as much about me as I know about 						myself, why are you taking me home with you?Arent you at all worried I 						might be deranged or how this might affect your reputation?I dont quite 						understand your reasoning.She clasped her bare hands, 						bringing them to the lap of her calico gown.Dont complicate this, Brit.Im only doin this because Ive got guilt as deep as the Hudson and youve 						got money to see us both through.I also wasnt about to let you aimlessly 						wander the city in your condition.He shrugged.I would have 						managed.Yes.The way you managed that day on the 						street and ended up where you are now, completely oblivious to yourself and 						the world.Robinson lapsed into agitated 						silence, trying to recapture what he could remember.He remembered the 						hospital and all of the brass beds that lined the hall.He remembered the 						oatmeallike plaster ceiling that peeled in sections above his bed.He 						remembered the endless conversations hed shared with Dr.Carter, who had 						patiently assisted him in doing things he already knew how to do but oddly 						couldnt remember doing.Like how to shave, tie a cravat and read from a 						book of poems by Robert Burns.Dr.Carter mentioned an omni being 						responsible for my condition, but refused to share any details pertaining to 						the incident.What happened?Twas sad, she admitted 						quietly.Some pignut slit the strings on my reticule and you chased him in 						an effort to retrieve it.Thats when the omni swiped you.It was so odd to hear about 						himself doing things he didnt remember doing.Rather heroic of 					me.Actually, here in New York, we 						call that stupid.A reticule isnt worth ones life.For pitys sake, you 						tried to dash past a movin omni, and, wellthose maggots drive like a 						priest on the way to confession.They never stop.In one short breath She 						leaned in and smacked her hands together.Bam!He lowered his chin.Bam.I 						see.And that is when I awoke in the hospital, yes?No.You were conscious 						thereafter, though not for very long.I knew somethin wasnt right.You 						could hardly move or talk.I stayed with you the whole while after I 						delivered you into Dr.Carters care.I even tried visitin your bed when 						you regained consciousness, but Dr.Carter wouldnt let me, seein you and 						most of the men in the hall were half naked.So I just called on Dr.Carters office when I could to ensure you were doin well.He searched her face.What made 						you repeatedly inquire about me?Hospitals arent known for 						their care, Brit, as much as their morgues.I was worried.Yes, the care most certainly 						was lacking.Some patients slept in their own vomit and were rarely cleaned.I assisted them and others whenever I could.Aside from the stench, I 						couldnt bear watching grown men choking on what little was left of their 						pride.She observed him.How much did 						Dr.Carter tell you about your condition?Did he talk to you about it at 						all?He shrugged.Somewhat.He seems 						to think that when I was flung to the ground, it jarred my brain and 						affected my ability to recall events.Did he mention that Robinson 						Crusoe isnt really your name?He glanced at her, his throat 						tightening.No.That he did not.She shook her head.I dont 						understand his so called medical advice.How are you supposed to assimilate 						if you arent given the means to decipher what is and isnt 					real?He set his trembling hands on 						his knees.Why would Dr.Carter have maliciously allowed him to believe 						otherwise?How does he know it isnt my name?It could be.I sense that it 						is.Not accordin to him.He claims 						that some of the events you speak of, includin the name itself, all came 						out of the pages of a book about a shipwrecked sailor.September 30, 1659.I, unhappy Robinson 						Crusoe, having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this desolate island, which 						I named the Desolate Island of Despair, the rest being swallowed up in the 						tempestuous sea.Pushing out an uneasy breath, he 						tried to force away those misplaced words that never seemed to stop.What 						year is it?I never did ask Dr.Carter.She eyed him.July of 						1830.Oh, God.He pressed his fingers 						against his temple, wishing he could shove reality back into it.When would 						this damnable haze lift?I cannot be this Robinson.Not given that the year 						in my head is September of 1659.What in blazes is wrong with me?Why do I 						have somesomebook burned in my head but nothing else?It doesnt make 						any sense.She grabbed his hand and shook 						it.Try not to rile yourself over it.Give it time.Ive no doubt your 						family will settle you back into your way of life when they 					come.He gently clasped his other hand 						over her small one, basking in its unexpected warmth and comfort.What if I 						dont have a family?What will become of me then?Oh, hush.Everyone always has 						someone in 						their life.Be it family or not.She slipped her hand from his, patting his 						forearm before setting it back onto her lap.More than enough time has 						passed to ensure people are lookin for you.And if theyre lookin, youd 						best believe theyll see the newspapers when it goes to print.Theyll come 						for you.I know they will.Robinson nodded, hoping she was 						right, because he didnt want to live like this anymore.He felt like a 						ghost without a gravestone to refer to.I appreciate you taking me 						in.Theres no need to thank me.Im only puttin a roof over your head and feedin you.Anyone can do that 						for a nickel and a dime.Money.She would need money, and 						given her worn boots and frayed bonnet it didnt appear as if she had very 						much of it to begin with.He pressed a hand against the satchel weighing his 						inner coat pocket.Im willing to give you half of everything I have in 						return for your generosity.Im not about to take half.She lowered her gaze to his shoulder and leaned in.But if youd be willin 						to give me six dollars, she bargained, Ill see to it that all of your 						food and rent is paid for out of my own pocket.I know six is a lot to ask 						for, but it would help me fill the last of my box.I earn more than enough 						from laundry to cover basic expenses, give or take a quarter.We wont be 						eatin mutton or chops, but porridge, oysters, yams and the likes I can 						easily fit on the menu.Sensing that she wasnt 						accustomed to asking for anything, he gently offered, If you require more 						than six dollars, so that we may eat better and fill your box, I should hope you 						will ask for it.She smiled, her features 						brightening.She leaned back against the wooden bench.Youre beautifully 						kind, Robinson, but six dollars is all this woman needs to buy herself a new 						life.He blinked.You intend to 						buy 						yourself a new life?For six dollars?Is that even possible?Of course its possible.She 						lowered her voice.Im movin out west, you see.To Ohio.Ive a good 						friend who used to be a neighbor of mineAgnes Meehan, who moved out that 						way with her father shortly after my husband died.She wrote me sayin 						theres cheap land to be had, and if I could find my way out there with 						fifty dollars, I could invest in half an acre and work my way toward a 						better life.So Ive been savin for that half acre ever since, and six 						dollars is about the last of what I need.Thatll put me at sixty.Five for 						the stagecoach, five for food and the rest for the land.She faced the bench opposite 						them again, staring out before herself with a dreamy smile still touching 						her lips.I intend to farm that half acre and set a one room cabin on it.It wont be much, barely a few logs slapped together on a scrap of land, but 						itll be more than enough for me.And just beyond that pile of logs, Ill 						plant a row of apple trees thatll blossom every spring and bear barrels of 						fruit.Apples, flowers and freshly overturned earth will scent the air 						durin the day, and at night Ill stand outside on my land, lookin up at 						starry skies, listenin to the wind.She released a breathy sigh and 						half nodded.Ill be self made.Not man made.Though I do plan on marryin 						again.The thought of livin alone depresses me.Robinson intently observed her, 						the clatter of the wheels overtaking all sound.God, did he admire the 						wistful dreaminess in that lilting voice.It made him want everything she 						had just described, right down to the whistling wind and the apple trees.It 						held a peaceful and divine purpose found by honest, hard work cradled within 						a dream and a promise that something could be his.Compared to this void writhing within 						him, telling him that he owned nothing, not a family or a home or a woman of 						his own, it was paradise in its truest form.She glanced out the window.Time sure does flit.The next stop is already ours.Pardon my reach.She 						leaned forward, setting her bare hand on his thigh to balance herself and 						reached across him to pull on the rope attached to the drivers leg.Sometimes these damn drivers claim not to feel the rope.So I make sure 						they do.She set her chin and yanked the 						rope several more times, the faint scent of crisp soap and lye drifting 						toward him as she swayed against each solid tug.A familiar shiver of awareness 						raced through him.That scent.It was so hauntingly familiar.It whispered 						to him that if he buried himself within that fragrance, he would forever 						know compassion, comfort and peace.He instinctively slid his hand 						to her back, grazing the small hooks on her gown, and pressed her warmth 						against the side of his body, desperately wanting to touch her.Georgia?She stiffened and glanced up at 						him, her hand falling away from the rope and drifting down to his thigh.Her 						lips parted as her shadowed green eyes searched his face.What is it?Is 						something wrong?You not feelin well?Art thou afraid to be the same in thine 						own act and valour as thou art in desire?Were those his words responding to 						his heart in this moment?He didnt know, but something chanted that 						if he didnt attempt to make this woman his, hed be missing out on the 						greatest opportunity hed ever known as a man.He drew her closer toward 						himself, his hands rounding her slim shoulders, and whispered, I want to 						kiss you.Can I?She let out a shaky breath, the 						warmth of that mouth grazing against his own.Im not very good at 						kissin.Cradling her against the curve 						of his arm, he pressed her softness against his tensing body.At least you 						remember what its like.She tilted her lips upward 						toward his own and smirked.Youre just tryin to make me feel sorry for 						you.Do you?Oddly, yes.I do feel sorry for 						you.Good.He lowered his lips to 						hers.Closing his eyes, he savored the warmth of her soft mouth lingering 						against his own and better molded his lips against that delicate 						mouth.Her moist lips parted.Though he 						wanted to slide his tongue deep into that mouth and ravage it, he didnt 						know if that was something he was supposed to do, so he lingered, hoping she 						would take the lead.He could barely breathe.Her hot velvet tongue instantly 						slid against his own, grazing his teeth.He bit back his own need to groan, 						as an ache overwhelmed his entire body.He slowly gave in to circling his 						tongue against hers, sensing the tongue was more than 					permissible.She tasted like 						spicedwhiskey?She grabbed hold of the lapels 						on his coat and dragged him down, down onto her, shifting her entire body 						beneath his own, until they were both practically hanging off the bench.He 						tightened his hold on her shoulders and waist and dug his booted heels into 						the floor of the omni to keep them both from falling.Pressing herself more savagely 						against him, she pushed her tongue deeper into his mouth, responding to his 						tongue so fiercely his heart pounded in disbelief.Entranced by the 						unexpected passion pouring out of her, he reveled in the way that wet tongue 						moved so erotically against his own.If this were the one and only kiss he 						were to ever remember as a man, he would honor it with never ending, 						glorying pride.May the lightning of heaven consume me, if 						I adore thee not to distraction!Crushing one hand against her 						bonnet, he slid his other hand down the smooth fabric of her gown, curving 						it to her firm, corseted waist.He dug the tips of his fingers into the 						fabric separating them, feeling as if he were racing against his own mind 						and breath, trying to remain grounded in this incredible reality.He trailed 						his hand back up toward her breasts, rounding his hand around its softness 						and weight.His cock swelled from the touch, and the need to rip his clothes 						apart, in an effort to show her just how divine she was, consumed the last 						of him.He kissed her harder, frantically digging and grinding his erection 						into her thigh.Georgia tightened her lips in an 						effort to force out his tongue, digging her fingers into his 					biceps.Reluctantly breaking their kiss, 						he dragged her back upright and repositioned her sidesaddle onto his lap.He 						cradled her for a long moment, her uneven breaths matching his own.It was 						the first time in nine days he felt like he finally belonged to someone and 						he swore to himself that he would never let this or her go, lest he be 						swallowed back into nothingness.The omni around them swayed to a 						halt as the driver called out their stop.She shifted to move, but he 						fiercely held her in place.Reaching up, he trailed the tips of his fingers 						down past the faded ribbon of her bonnet toward the soft slope of her 						curving throat.Take me out west with you, he insisted in a barely 						composed tone.I want everything you spoke of.Right down to the wind and 						the apple trees.I will give you every last nickel in my pocket if you 						promise to take me with you.Her eyes widened.She shoved his 						hand away and scrambled outside of his grasp and off his lap.Stumbling 						forward and onto her feet, she caught herself against the narrow pathway 						between the two benches leading to the rear door of the omni.Whatever do 						you mean you want my land and my apple trees?We barely know each other.Even worse, you dont even know your name.He sat up.You will need 						someone to build your cabin, till the land and chop timber.I can do that 						for you.I can.She gawked at him, then shook 						her head and frantically arranged her skirts.No.Dont you be stickin 						your hands into my head and playin with my dreams like that.Theyre my 						dreams.You hear?Not yours.Mine.He swallowed, his chest 						tightening.I need help, Georgia.I need help if Im going to rebuild a 						sense of reality.And I think youre the one to help me do it.Stop it, she tossed at him in 						a harsh tone.Im not takin you with me and I most certainly cant help 						you in the way you think I can.I know you can.I felt it 						before and after we touched.She glared at him.I know what 						you felt, Brit, and it wasnt that.Ive got plans and Im sorry to say this, because 						I like you, I really do, but my plans dont involve a man who doesnt know 						his up from his down.A woman such as myself, who has very little to begin 						with, needs a grain of security.And you arent it.He scrambled to his feet.But 						that kiss  I shouldnt have allowed for 						it.All right?I shouldnt have taken advantage of you.Youre not in your 						right mind and it was wrong of me.Now justjust get off the damn omni 						before it takes off and were forced to walk half the night.Throwing open 						the door, she hurried down the small stairs leading out of the omni and 						disappeared into the night, leaving him to feel again he belonged to no one 						and nothing.At Christmas I no more desire a rose than wish a snow in Mays newfangled shows.William Shakespeare, A Pleasant Conceited Comedie Called, Loues labors loft (1598) ROBINSON JUMPED OUT AFTER Georgia, his boots thudding against the shadowed dirt road, and slammed the rear door of the omni.The boxed carriage reared forward, its large wheels kicking up dust that bit into his watering eyes.An overwhelming stench of festering sewage penetrated his nostrils.Bleed me, he growled, burying the lower half of his face into the crook of his arm in an attempt to block the assaulting stink.He swung toward Georgia, who was already crossing the wide, dimly lit street.She dodged an oncoming huckster and a peddler cart, disappearing from sight.He lowered his arm, his heart pounding knowing that his only connection to reality was abandoning him.Georgia!He jogged after her, the acrid air crawling down his throat.He swallowed, mentally willing away the sensation of nausea that threatened to heave out his innards.Do you intend to loathe me for wanting to share in your dream of going west?That hardly seems fair.Her shadow reappeared on the pavement just outside the dull, yellowing light of a gas lamppost.She paused and glanced back at him, dropping the folds of her skirts.Your family is waitin for you, Brit.
