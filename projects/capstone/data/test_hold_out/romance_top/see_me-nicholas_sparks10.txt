Yeah, she said.For me, too.After making the rounds with the family, Lily and Evan joined Colin and Maria at the table on the porch.Thanks for cleaning up my place, Maria said.It was no problem at all, Lily said.And I must say, its an absolutely charming location.Evan and I considered moving downtown as well, but Evan insisted that he couldnt imagine having no lawn to mow.I dont do that now, Evan said.Colin does it.I hate mowing the lawn.Hush, now, she said.I was just teasing.But you should know that physical labor can be quite attractive in a man.What do you think I was doing today?My point exactly, she said.You cut a very appealing figure as you were moving furniture, you know.The door to the porch opened and Carmen came out carrying place settings for each of them, followed by several plates of food that occupied more than half the table.Not only had the kitchen been hopping all day, but most of the relatives had brought food as well.I hope you are hungry, Carmen said in English.It was too much food.Just like always.While Colin seemed to have expected it, both Evan and Lily looked overwhelmed.This is great, Mom, Maria said, suddenly grateful for her mothers wordless demonstration of love.I love you.CHAPTER 31      Colin      A  fter dinner, Colin wandered out to the front yard, seeking some time alone.A pair of uncles sat in lawn chairs overlooking the street, nodding at Colins polite salute.Reflexively, he relived the destruction hed seen at Marias house, trying to piece together its connection to Atkinson and Lester.Lester and Atkinson had once worked together, and Lester had introduced Atkinson to his sister.And while Maria believed that Lester had been sending messages to her, Dr.Manning suggested that Atkinson was responsible.It was uncanny timing that Atkinson had disappeared shortly before Marias stalking began.Presumably, Atkinson had slashed Marias tires, but which of the two had killed Copo?Lester shot Margolis; Atkinson removed the car from the bungalow and later trashed Marias place.Given the trove of information found on Atkinsons computer, his involvement in Marias stalking seemed clear cut, but certain details continued to bother Colin.Dr.Manning had mentioned an argument between Lester and Atkinson and said theyd had a falling out, but when had they regained each others trust?Which one was in charge?Why had Dr.Manning insisted that Atkinson was trying to frame Lester when it seemed clear they had to be working together?And if they were working together, why drive two cars to the Sanchez house the night Lester attacked Maria?And yet as Colin had cleaned Marias condo, hed thought back on the earlier conversation with Detective Wright and realized that there was no evidence conclusively linking Atkinson to the trashing of the condo yet.There wasnt any conclusive evidence supporting the idea that hed slashed Marias tires, either.Despite the content found on his computer, Maria had never interacted with him or even seen him.Shed said all along that Atkinsons involvement never felt plausible to her, which meant  What?Suppose Atkinson really had gone off to meet a woman.And what if Lester knew that Atkinson would be out of town?Lester could have planted the information on Atkinsons computer and taken Atkinsons car while he was away.Lester could have  as Maria had pointed out the night before  easily paid someone to slash Marias tires.Maybe even trash her condo.It would be the perfect setup as long as you believed that Lester was capable of such intricate planning.Based on the behavior that Colin had witnessed at the bungalow and the way Wright had described Lesters actions at the station, that felt unlikely.And since Atkinson had apparently driven Lester back to Shallotte after hed shown up at the Sanchezes, Atkinson had to have been nearby.They had to be working together, and Colin supposed that Lester must have been spooked by the sirens.Atkinson must have heard them, too, fueling his own panic, and hed picked Lester up before racing the two of them out of the neighborhood.They would have been driving fast and possibly as recklessly as Colin had, but in the opposite direction  Like the car Colin had almost hit just blocks from the Sanchezes home?Colin felt something akin to a key turning in a lock, and strained to remember exactly what hed seen.The car careening toward him, swerving in the last instant, the vehicles brushing past with only inches to spare.Two men in the front seat.What kind of car?A Camry.Blue.Reaching for his phone, he called Detective Wright, who answered on the second ring.Have you heard anything about Margolis?Colin asked.Improving.Or so they say.Still in critical care and still unconscious.How are things there?Theyre okay.Marias safe.And tonight?Shell stay here.Shes well protected.If you say so.What do you need?Im thinking that Atkinson might be driving a blue Camry.Relatively new.Why do you think that?Colin outlined his reasoning.You wouldnt have happened to have gotten a license plate, would you?No.Okay.Its not much, but Ill get the word out.Everyone wants to find this guy, the sooner the better.Colin disconnected, somehow sure that Lester had been in the blue Camry that night.He felt certain, even if he couldnt explain the reason, other than to assume that his subconscious mind was somehow ahead of his conscious mind in understanding that the answers were there, if only he could find them.What are you doing out here?Evan asked, joining Colin in the front yard.Thinking, Colin answered.It was half past six, and dusk had given way to darkness, the autumn air hinting at even cooler temperatures as the evening wore on.I figured.I saw the smoke drifting out of your ears.Colin smiled.I just got off the phone with Detective Wright, he explained, recapping the conversation.What are you doing out here?As sweet as Carmen is, her food is kinda spicy.Lily asked me to get her some gum from the glove compartment to help cool down her mouth.If you ask me, Lily just wants her breath to smell minty fresh, because not having minty fresh breath isnt ladylike.He shrugged.By the way, what do you make of all this?Marias family, I mean?I think theyre great.Its kind of amazing, isnt it?Her entire extended family showing up to keep her safe?Colin nodded.I doubt even my immediate family would show up.Evan raised an eyebrow.Dont kid yourself.When things were bad, even your family circled the wagons.Friends, too, Colin said.Thanks for your help today.I know you wanted to spend the day in bed with Lily.Youre welcome.Evan shrugged.But it wasnt going to work out anyway.I couldnt stop thinking about Margolis, which kind of put a damper on my mood.I still cant figure out how he let Lester get the jump on him.Colin paused.When he was on the porch, did he look confused to you?He looked pissed off, Evan said.Because we hadnt left yet.How did he look before that?I have no idea, dude, Evan said, shaking his head.Everything is so jumbled, Im not really sure what happened.I can remember hearing shots and seeing you doing your crazy thing, but after that its just all blood.My brains so scrambled, I cant even remember why I came out here in the first place.You came out here to get Lily some gum, Colin reminded him.Oh yeah.Thats right.Minty freshness.Evan started toward the car and then turned around to look back at Colin.Do you want a piece?No, Colin said.But Dr.Manning probably would  Colin wasnt sure why Margoliss description of Mannings compulsive gum chewing leaped to mind, but after considering it, he shook his head, deciding to head back inside with Evan and rejoin Marias family.They were a marvel, he had to admit.Talk about circling the wagons.In times of crisis, family was sometimes all you really had.Hell, even Dr.Manning showed up for Lester.Hed spoken to Margolis, hed shown up at the station, and hed also immediately arranged for an attorney, since Lester had been in no condition to do so himself.But how had Dr.Manning even known of Lesters arrest?Wright had said that the attorney had shown up ten minutes after Lester had arrived at the station.Colin knew from experience that it was almost impossible to procure an attorney that quickly, especially on a Friday night after business hours.Which meant that Dr.Manning had known that Lester had been arrested well before his arrival at the station.It was almost like he was there  And had parked his car in the driveway?No, Colin thought.Margolis would have recognized the car.Hed seen Dr.Mannings car yesterday morning, when the doctor had shown Margolis the gun in the trunk.And if it had been Dr.Mannings car at the bungalow, Margolis probably would have acted  Confused?Colin stopped in his tracks.No.It wasnt possible.But  Families circle the wagons Son and father Lester and Dr.Manning Dr.Manning nervously mowing through a pack of gum while talking to Margolis  Colin groped for the answer, a forgotten detail And?Hadnt he noticed a bunch of gum wrappers strewn on the roof of the building across from Marias office?Colin could barely breathe.It wasnt Atkinson and Lester.It was father and son circling the wagons, and all at once, the answers started cascading through his mind as quickly as Colin could form the questions.Why hadnt Margolis been more cautious at the bungalow?Because he saw that Avery Manning, the father, was already there.And Lesters gun?Dr.Manning had told Margolis the gun likely wasnt real.Why had Margolis gone inside?Because Dr.Manning called out to him, assuring Margolis that everything was okay.It fit; it all fit, he thought, clarity finally emerging.But Lester was arrested.Only because Colin was there to take him down.Otherwise, Lester might have escaped.But Lester might talk.The attorney Dr.Manning hired would make sure he didnt.But Dr.Manning had left a message for Margolis, urging him to warn Maria  After the fact  too late to matter.And Atkinson?The man who failed to intervene when Laws abducted Cassie?Who Dr.Manning might feel deserves to be punished as well?But Atkinsons laptop the photos, the files  All of which made Atkinson the perfect fall guy.By then, Colin was already reaching for his phone, the truth so obvious that he wasnt sure how he could have missed it.Who had the knowledge and skill necessary to manipulate Lester?Dr.Manning, the psychiatrist.How had Atkinsons name come up in the first place?Dr.Manning.And Lawss pattern of stalking Cassie?Dr.Manning knew every detail.Colin heard a voice on the other end of the phone.Wright, sounding busy and stressed.You again, Wright said.Whats up?Check to see if Dr.Manning owns a blue Camry.Wright hesitated.Hold on.Why?Have someone check it out while I talk, Colin said.Just do it.Its important.After he heard Wright call out the request to another officer, Colin told him everything.When he finished, Wright was quiet for a moment.That sounds a little far fetched, dont you think?Wright said.But if youre right, Margolis will be able to clear all this up as soon as he regains consciousness.Besides Wright seemed to be wrestling with his own doubts.Yes?Its not as though Dr.Manning is trying to hide.Far from it  he was at the station last night and he was at the hospital today   He was there?Colin asked, feeling a mounting sense of panic.He spoke with Rachel.He wanted to apologize for what his son did and asked if it might be possible to speak with Pete, so that he could apologize to him, too.Dont let him near Margolis!Colin shouted, panic giving way to fear.Keep it down, Wright said.Manning couldnt see him.Even I couldnt see him.Only family is allowed in the ICU   Manning went there to kill him!Colin interrupted.Hes a medical doctor Hed know what to do to make the death look natural.Dont you think youre jumping to conclusions?Lester didnt shoot Margolis!Dr.Manning did!Lester had Margolis squarely in his sights, but he couldnt pull the trigger.If you dont believe me, test Lesters hands for gunpowder residue.That wont tell us anything.Its too late.Those tests get less effective by the hour   I know Im right about this!Wright was silent for a long moment.Okay but what about Atkinsons computer?Atkinson is dead, Colin said with sudden certainty.Dr.Manning killed him.Made it look like he went on a trip, took his car, planted evidence on the computer, made him the prime suspect, and planned it all.Wright said nothing.After a moment of silence, Colin heard the muffled sound of the detective speaking with someone else.Colin felt his frustration rising until Wright came back on the line, sounding slightly stunned.Dr.Manning, Wright said slowly, owns a blue Camry, and I gotta go I want to verify that the Camry was at the bungalow  Wright hung up midsentence.Colin raced inside to update Maria, finding her still on the back porch with Evan and Lily, her parents, and a scattering of aunts and uncles.As Colin related his discoveries, Maria listened silently.By the end, her eyes were closed, and though the revelations were clearly frightening to her, he also sensed a kind of peace in her at finally knowing the truth.Her relatives, meanwhile, remained silent, all of them waiting for her to respond.Okay, Maria finally said.Whats next?Im guessing Wright will put out an APB on Dr.Manning and then do whatever else it is cops do when searching for a suspect and building a case.Maria thought about that.But what about the pattern?she finally ventured.I mean, if Dr.Manning wanted me to experience everything Laws had done to Cassie, why would he have vandalized my place last night?He had to know that it would make it even more difficult to get to me.And why didnt Lester grab me when he had the chance to  Beat me, maybe burn me alive, and then kill himself, she didnt need to add.Colin remembered what Laws had done, but knew that Dr.Manning had never planned to kill himself.Hed wanted Atkinsons body found in the ashes, which would close the case for good, leaving Dr.Manning a free man.All Colin could do was shake his head.I dont know, he admitted.Seven oclock now, and the night was growing even darker, with just a sliver of moon above the horizon.As the family, led by Felix, began making additional plans to keep Maria safe, Colin drifted to the kitchen and retrieved a glass from the cupboard.He was thirsty, but he also wanted to be alone while he pondered Marias questions.Moving to the refrigerator, he set the glass under the dispenser.Filling it with water, he downed the glass in a single long pull and began refilling it, his eyes absently scanning the refrigerator door.There were photos of Maria and Serena over the years, poems, Marias confirmation certificate, and a drawing of a rainbow in crayon with Serenas name carefully etched in the corner.Some of the items had begun to yellow at the edges, and the only recent addition appeared to be the letter Serena had received from the Charles Alexander Foundation.It was in the upper corner, partially obscuring a postcard that displayed the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City.As Colin glanced at the letterhead, he was again nagged by the thought that the name seemed oddly familiar.Still  Marias questions had left him feeling unsettled.Why had Dr.Manning vandalized her condo?If Dr.Manning wanted Maria to experience everything Cassie had, then why deviate from the pattern now?And why paint the words You will know how it feels in her bedroom when doing so only made her more inaccessible?It was possible, he supposed, that Dr.Manning had panicked or lost control after Lester had been arrested.Colin wanted to believe that, tried to force himself to, but couldnt quite make that leap.Instead, he felt like hed overlooked something.Either he was missing a piece of the puzzle, or Dr.Manning no longer cared whether he could get to Maria at all  But why wouldnt he care?Turning from the fridge, he took another drink, consoling himself with the notion that even without the answers, not only was Maria safe, but shed remain safe until Dr.Manning was apprehended.Colin and her family would make sure of that.They gave circling the wagons a whole new meaning.Hell, all of them were here right now, standing watch  But in that instant, he realized he was wrong.Not all of them were here.One of them was missing and Dr.Manning no longer cared whether he could get to Maria at all  Because Maria had never been part of Dr.Mannings endgame in the first place?In Colins mind, the answers began to tumble fast, clarity emerging the name on the letterhead and why it seemed so familiar why Marias place had been trashed how Lester had known about Carmens birthday the real meaning behind the words that had been painted in the bedroom  You will know how it feels  Dropping the glass, Colin burst from the kitchen, through the living room, and down the short hallway into Marias bedroom.He located her bags and spotted her laptop in her tote bag.Grabbing it, he flipped up the lid, thinking, No, no, no please God, let me be wrong about this  He opened the search program and typed in the name of the foundation that had awarded Serenas scholarship wanted to see it prayed for it to come up  No website displayed; just a notice saying the site had been taken down and that the domain name was available.No, no, no  He typed in Avery Mannings name and recognized the same links hed perused after he and Maria had met with Margolis the first time.He remembered the link that had included Avery Mannings photograph, and clicked on it even as he rushed back to the living room.Looking up, he spotted Carmen, but not Felix.Carmen!he shouted, hoping shed be able to understand what he was about to say.Relatives turned his way, alarmed.Colin ignored them.Ignored Carmens sudden expression of fright.From the corner of his eye, he saw the back slider opening, Maria about to enter.By then, hed reached Carmen.He held up the computer and was pointing to the photograph.Do you recognize him?Colin said, talking loud and fast.Fear now building to panic.Is this the man who came to the house for dinner?Is this the director of the foundation?Carmen began shaking her head.No s No entiendo Habla ms despacio, por favor.Whats going on?Maria cried.What are you doing, Colin?Youre scaring her!Its him!Colin shouted.Who?Maria yelled, his fear contagious.Whats happening?By then, Felix had come rushing through the slider, too, followed by Evan and Lily, more relatives  Look at him!Colin said to Carmen, pointing to the photograph, lowering his voice, trying and failing to sound calm.Look at the photo!The director!Is this him?Is this who came to your house for dinner?Mira la foto, Mam!Maria translated, moving next to her.Es sto el director de la fundacin?Quin vino a la casa para la cena?Carmens eyes swiveled in terror between Colin and Maria before she leaned in to scrutinize the photo on the screen.After a moment, she began nodding quickly.S!Carmen said, seemingly on the verge of tears.Charles Alexander!l es el director!l estaba aqu en la casa!Colin!Maria yelled, grabbing his arm.He turned, his panicked gaze on her.Wheres Serena?he demanded.Where is she?At the interview, you know that Whats wrong?Wheres the interview?Wheres it taking place?I dont know.I guess at the foundations office  Wheres the office?Colin shouted.Downtown on the waterfront, Maria stammered.The older commercial area, not the historic district.Tell me whats happening!Abandoned buildings, Colin thought.Foreclosed buildings.Fire Thoughts falling as fast as shuffling cards Dr.Manning no longer caring whether he could get to Maria Maria needing to know how it feels Because it wasnt only about making Maria experience Cassies terror, it was about punishing Maria, making her feel the same way Dr.Manning and Lester felt after someone they loved had been murdered.Oh, God  Call the police!Colin shouted.Call 911!Colin!Maria screamed.Talk to me!Avery Manning pretended to be Charles Alexander!Colin shouted, feeling the clock was ticking and knowing there wasnt time to explain everything.Dr.Manning had a child named Alexander Charles.There is no foundation.Or scholarship.Dr.Manning made it up, he hissed.You werent the target  Serenas the target.Shes with him right now and I need to know exactly where she is before  Maria understood everything in an instant, her expression stricken as Colin grabbed her hand and pulled her along with him, racing for the door that led to the garage.He vaguely heard Maria screaming, Llame a la polica!Emergencia!Llame a nueve uno uno!over her shoulder as they burst from the garage, racing to his car.Maria dove in and Colin was rounding the car when he heard Evan shouting that they were coming, too.Colin jumped behind the wheel, barking out instructions for Maria to call Detective Wright.He turned the key hard, gunning the engine, his tires screeching as he tore away from the house.In the rearview mirror, he vaguely noticed headlights turning on, Evan and Lily and various relatives trailing in his wake.When did Serena say she had the interview?Colin demanded, even as Maria was waiting for Wright to answer her call.I cant remember Seven, maybe?Whats the address?I picked her up at the office once, but I dont know  Colin pressed the accelerator to the floor and the engine roared, the car shuddering as it rounded the first curve Colin fighting the thought that he might already be too late cursing himself for not figuring it out sooner.The headlights in the rearview mirror grew smaller as the speedometer nosed toward seventy, and then eighty.He slammed on the brakes, skidding onto the main road to the screech of an oncoming cars tires.Undeterred, he sped up again, only dimly aware that Maria was screaming into the phone at Detective Wright.Colin continued to accelerate, surging close to a hundred miles an hour, feeling dj vu as he swerved into the bike lane and slowing but not stopping for red lights.He leaned on his horn, flashed his lights, and cut through parking lots as precious seconds ticked by.Maria had hung up with Detective Wright and was now frantically dialing and redialing, her actions growing even more panicked.Serenas not answering her phone!Find out when she left the dorm!Colin shouted.But how?I dont know!Colin changed lanes, ran another red light, and checked the rearview mirror.Evans headlights were too far behind to see anymore, and Colin squeezed the steering wheel, furious with himself for being so stupid, for missing the obvious.Thinking about Serena, telling himself that hed get there in time to save her.Hed get there.He had to get there.Charles Alexander.Alexander Charles.Hed seen the name on the computer, and the connection was right there on the refrigerator, in the damn letterhead!And Serena had even said the name at dinner!It was obvious, and Colin couldnt understand why it had taken him so long to put it together.If something happened to Serena because hed been so damn stupid  Colin vaguely heard Maria shout the name Steve into the phone Heard her demanding to know when Serena had left heard her say that Serena was running late and had left at 6:40  What time is it?Colin demanded, speeding so fast he was unable to take his eyes from the road for a second.Check your phone!Seven twelve  Serena might not have arrived yet  Or she was there already  Colin pressed his teeth together, his jaw muscles pulsing, thinking that if anything had happened to her  Hed hunt Dr.Manning to the ends of the earth.The man deserved to die, and in that instant, Colins thoughts began narrowing as he felt a visceral, almost tangible urge to kill him.In his ever growing rage, the speedometer topped 120, and all Colin could think was Go, go, go      CHAPTER 32      Maria      C  olin was driving so fast that the images beyond the windows were blurry.Despite the seat belt, Maria was being flung from side to side whenever he made a turn or braked or accelerated.And yet, all she could think about was Serena and that shed been the target all along.And hed toyed with her  The fake scholarship.Interviews.Slowly earning her trust  But all the while, hed been planning.Following Serena.Stalking.Not just in person, but on Serenas social media, too.Hed come to dinner with the family because hed known Maria wouldnt be there Serena had told the world that Maria had a date.Hed known Maria would celebrate their moms birthday because Serena had posted about that, too.As the reality of what was happening sank in, Maria felt a mounting sense of panic that began to take on a life of its own.It was getting harder to catch her breath as the muscles in her chest began to compress.She tried to will the sensations away and from past experience knew she was having a panic attack, but she kept thinking about Serena.What if they were already too late?What if Dr.Manning had already abducted Serena and would do to her what had been done to Cassie?Marias mind flashed on the photos from Lawss crime scene and her lungs suddenly constricted even more, making breathing almost impossible.She told herself again that it was simply a panic attack, but as she tried and failed to draw a breath, she knew that she was mistaken.This wasnt a panic attack.It wasnt like this the last time.All at once, she felt a searing pain in her chest that traveled down her left arm.Oh my God, she thought.Im having a heart attack  Colin hit the brakes and the momentum flung Maria hard into the shoulder harness.She was flung again moments later as he made another turn, her head banging the window.Maria barely registered the pain; all she could think about was the pressure in her chest and the fact that she couldnt breathe.She tried to scream, but no sound came out.In that instant, she was only vaguely aware that her phone had suddenly dinged and vibrated with an incoming text, the thought immediately vanishing as the world began going black at the edges.Maria?Whats wrong?Colin called out.Are you okay?Im having a heart attack!Maria tried to say as her eyes began to close.Im dying!But the words still wouldnt come.She couldnt breathe, her heart was giving out, and though she heard Colin calling out her name, it sounded both underwater and far away, and she couldnt understand why Colin wasnt doing anything, why he wasnt helping her.He needed to call an ambulance and rush her to the hospital  Her thoughts were disrupted as she was suddenly shoved upright in her seat and felt pressure on her shoulder; a moment later, her body was being shaken.Take control of this, Maria!Colin commanded.Youre having a panic attack!Its not a panic attack!her mind screamed as she fought for every breath, frantically wondering why he wasnt helping her.Its real this time, cant you see that?Maria!Listen to me!Maria!Colin shouted.I need to know where Serena went!Manning is with her right now!I need your help!Serena needs your help!Serena  Maria instinctively opened her eyes at the mention of her sisters name and latched on to the sound, focusing on it, but it was too late  Maria!This time, it was the sound of her own name that jolted her.She thought; Colin is talking to me.She thought; Serena.She thought; Dr.Manning.Somehow, she was able to hold her eyes open, though she still couldnt breathe and she was dizzy.But Serena oh, God, Serena needed  Help.Every cell in her body continued to hammer its death omen at Maria, drowning out the reality of the situation.She fought to regain clarity; she forced herself to think about Serena and knew they were going to the waterfront to save her sister, and that her phone had vibrated with a text.It was all she could do to turn the screen faceup and focus, but she was somehow able to make out the words  Sorry.Ringer off.Walking to interview now.Wish me luck!Serena.Her sister was still alive, and they were racing to save her.Maria forced herself to draw a long, steady breath, and then another.A panic attack, thats all, she thought.I can get through this  But her body was still rebelling, even if her mind had begun to clear.Her hands shook and her fingers werent working right.She was able to hit the redial button, but the call went to voice mail.Meanwhile, Colin continued to shout at her from the drivers seat, even as he skidded through another turn  Maria!Are you okay?Tell me youre going to be okay!Though it took her a moment, she realized theyd reached South Front Street and were headed in the right direction.Im okay, she mumbled, still catching her breath, amazed she could speak at all, realizing that breathing was no longer impossible.Just need a minute.Colin quickly glanced over at her before facing forward again, pressing down on the accelerator.How much farther?he asked.I need to know where she is.I dont know, Maria answered, her voice still weak, her body struggling to recover.A few more blocks, she huffed, feeling dizzy.You sure?Was she?She looked up the street, wanting to make sure.Yes.On the left or right?Left, Maria answered.Straining, she forced herself to sit higher in the seat.Her body continued to tremble.Colin sped through the next intersection.Staring out the window, Maria vaguely noticed a half dozen shacks and boathouses closer to the river, looking dark and shadowed.Streetlights barely cut through the darkness.The cars momentum began to decrease as Colin lifted his foot from the accelerator, and they coasted the next block and through another intersection.Here, the architecture immediately shifted; the flat roofed buildings were now sandwiched together like row houses, some of the buildings in better condition than others.There were office lights blazing on some floors but most were blackened, and the cars on the street were separated by wider gaps.There was no traffic in either direction.As they drove through another block, the area suddenly began to feel familiar and Maria knew they were close, even as she struggled with a sudden rush of anger and guilt she felt for having a panic attack at the worst possible moment, when Serena needed her most.She reminded herself that shed been here before, and despite her bodys continued rebellion, she forced herself to take long breaths as she scanned the buildings.It was hard to tell for sure which was the one they wanted, since she hadnt been paying that much attention the first time shed come here.She vaguely recalled that Serena had been standing at an intersection and thered been some construction workers staring from the opposite side of the street She squinted, spotted scaffolding on a building at the corner, and then, on the opposite side of the street, Serenas car  There!she said, pointing.The four story brick one on the corner!Colin immediately pulled over, braking hard.He jumped out of the car and took off running, not waiting for Maria as she struggled to open her door, furious that her body had gone into revolt and needed to recover.She didnt have time for that.Not now.Especially not now.Finally pushing the door open, she willed herself to stand and start moving.By then, Colin had already reached the lobby door.She saw him struggling to open it, finding it locked, then jabbing at something beside the handle.When Maria looked up, there were seven or eight offices still illuminated on various floors, and she watched as Colin pounded the glass.She could tell from his body language that he was debating whether to smash his way in, but Maria instinctively knew that Serena wasnt in the office building.Nor was Dr.Manning.Hed been far too careful to this point to make that mistake now; hed been far too meticulous, and there were too many people in the building, too many potential witnesses, too many things that could go wrong.She guessed that Dr.Manning had been waiting for Serena on the sidewalk in front of the building and probably had a story about a pipe that burst or whatever, so the interview would be held elsewhere.She knew that he wanted someplace private, where he knew he wouldnt be caught, a place that would burn.Colin!she tried to shout.The sound came out weak.She tried to wave her arms, but the dizziness came back in a rush and she stumbled.Colin!she called out again, and this time he heard her voice and ran toward her.The door has one of those key code locks!Theres no listing for the foundation, so I just hit all the buttons, but no ones buzzing.Serenas not in there, Maria forced out.Manning took her someplace else.There are too many people inside, too many people still working.If she got in his car  She texted that she was walking to the interview.Then wheres his car?I dont see it.Check around the corner, Maria wheezed, still fighting waves of dizziness.He probably parked there.If hes looking for someplace deserted, he took her to one of the shacks or boathouses near the river.Hurry!she said, feeling like she was about to fall over.Just go.Ill get my phone and call the police And my parents, my relatives, Lily, everyone who jumped in their cars to follow us, she thought.By then, Colin was already backing up toward the intersection, uncertain, wanting to trust her, but  How do you know thats where theyll be?Because, she said, wondering when the police would arrive, remembering the lakeside cabin where Cassie had been murdered, remembering the shacks and boathouses common to this portion of the Cape Fear River, thats where Laws would have gone.CHAPTER 33      Colin      M  arias instincts had been right.He found the blue Camry parked on the cross street that ran beside the building.He sprinted past it.Straight ahead was an unkempt field that stretched toward the muddy banks of the Cape Fear River, a black void ahead of him, barren of reflection on this almost moonless night.The street gave way to a gravel road that forked to the left and right, toward the rivers edge.One way led to a small, run down marina with a rusting metal structure that was home to a hodgepodge of boats, protected by low fencing; in the other direction stood two decaying barnlike structures near the riverbank, spaced maybe fifty yards apart.Those buildings looked abandoned, with cracked planks and peeling, faded paint, overgrown weeds and kudzu surrounding them.Colin slowed, frantically trying to guess where Manning had taken Serena.In that instant, he saw a ray of light leaking out intermittently between the planks of the abandoned building on the left, vanishing and reappearing.The beam of a flashlight?He left the gravel, cutting through grass and weeds that were shin high in places, willing himself to move even faster, hoping he hadnt arrived too late.Still unsure what he was going to do, or what he was going to find.As he reached the building where hed seen the light, he pressed himself flush to the side of the wall.Up close, he realized that the structure had once been an icehouse, probably used by fishermen to load blocks of ice into their boats to keep their catch fresh.There was no door on this side of the building, but a boarded over window emitted a weak and flickering light.He began inching toward the side farthest from the river, hoping to find the door, when he heard a scream rip from inside  Serena  The sound galvanized him.He raced around the corner, but the door on that side had been boarded over.He accelerated past it, to the third side, seeing another boarded up window.One option left.He peeked around the corner and immediately spotted the door hed been looking for.Reaching for the knob, he found it locked.In that instant, he heard Serena cry out again.Stepping back, he drove his heel into the door next to the knob.It was a perfect shot, hard and fast, the frame splintering as the door cracked open.He kicked again and it swung fully open.In that split second, he saw Serena tied to a chair in the middle of a dimly lit room, Dr.Manning beside her with a flashlight in his hand.There was the shape of a body in the corner, surrounded by rusting paint cans.Serenas face was bruised and bloodied.Both Serena and Dr.Manning cried out in surprise when Colin burst into the room.A beam of light suddenly hit Colin straight in the eyes.Blinded and disoriented, Colin barreled ahead, reaching out in the direction hed last seen Dr.Manning.He spread his arms, but Manning had the advantage and sidestepped him.Colin felt the heavy metal flashlight crash into the back of his hand and heard the bones snap.The combination of shock and searing pain kept him from reacting quickly enough.As Serena screamed again, Colin twisted, trying to square his shoulders at Manning, but he was too late.The flashlight smashed into his temple, the sudden impact turning everything black.His body went limp and his legs buckled; he hit the floor even as his mind was still trying to process what had happened.Instinct and experience urged him to get up quickly, and after years of training, the movements should have been automatic, but his body wouldnt respond.He felt another hard blow to his skull, which shot radiant bursts of agony through his system.His mind was teetering on the edge of coherent thought; he registered nothing other than pain and confusion.Time seemed to shatter and fragment.Above the steady ringing in his ears, he could vaguely hear the sound of someone crying and screaming begging a womans voice and a mans  Twilight descended and pain broke over him like a wave.The sound of whimpering dimly penetrated his stupor; when he recognized his name, he was finally able to somehow open one eye.The world appeared hazy, nothing but a fog filled dream, but when he thought he saw Maria tied to a chair, it was enough to allow him to finally comprehend what had happened and where he was.No, not Maria.Serena.But he still couldnt move.Still unable to fully focus, he could distantly make out Dr.Manning as he moved along the far wall.He was holding something red and square in his hands.Colin heard Serenas continued cries and his nostrils were suddenly flooded with the odor of gasoline.It took a moment to put everything together.Dully, he watched Manning toss the gas can aside.Colin saw a flicker of light, a match, and watched it arc toward the ground.He heard the whoop of ignition, like lighter fluid on charcoal.He saw flames begin leaping at the walls, the old planks as dry as tinder.Heat began to rise.Smoke thickened.He tried to move his hands, tried to move his legs, but felt only numb paralysis.His mouth tasted metallic and coppery, and he saw a blur of movement as Manning ran past him, toward the door that Colin had kicked in.The flames were reaching toward the ceiling, Serenas cries telegraphing pure terror.He heard her cough once, and then again.Colin willed himself to move and wondered why his body wasnt working.Finally, his left arm began to inch forward.Then his right.He slid both arms under him and tried to rise, but his broken hand bones shifted.Colin screamed and his chest hit the floor, pain twisting his anger into rage, fueling his need for violence and revenge.He got to all fours and slowly managed to stand.He felt dizzy, his balance still off.He took a step and stumbled, his eyes stinging in the acrid smoke, tearing up.Serenas cries had turned to uncontrollable coughing; Colin felt as though he couldnt breathe at all.The flames had spread to the other walls, surrounding them.The heat was intense, the smoke becoming black, searing his lungs.Colin stumbled the couple of steps it took to reach Serena and eyed the ragged macram jungle of rope binding her to the chair.He knew that with one hand, there was no way to untie the rope in time, and he scanned his surroundings, hoping to see a knife.An ax.Anything sharp  Colin heard a loud crack, followed by a roar as the roof of the icehouse suddenly sagged, sending sparks in all directions.A rafter beam crashed within a few feet of them, then another fell even closer.Along three walls, flames seemed to multiply, the heat so intense that Colin felt as if his clothing had ignited.Beginning to panic, he grabbed the chair with Serena still in it and heaved, feeling a burst of pain in his broken hand.His mind flashed white, and it fueled the rage inside him.He could handle pain; he knew how to harness it, and tried to draw on it, but his hand would no longer grip.Unable to carry Serena, he had no other option.There were five, maybe six strides to the door, and grabbing the back of her chair with his good hand, he spun it around and began dragging it toward the doorway.He needed to get there before the flames did.He tugged and dragged, every jerk sending pain through his hand and his head.He burst through the open doorway.Smoke and heat followed them out, and he knew he needed to get Serena a safe distance away from the smoke.He couldnt drag her through the field or the mud, and spotting gravel to the right, he went that direction, toward the other building.Behind them, the icehouse was nearly engulfed in flames; the sound rose in volume, magnifying the continued ringing in his ears.He kept moving, resting only when the heat from the fire began to diminish.Serena hadnt stopped coughing, and in the darkness, her skin looked almost blue.He knew she needed an ambulance.She needed oxygen, and he still had to get her out of the chair.He saw nothing he could use to cut the rope, and he wondered if there might be something in the other building.Just as he started toward it, he saw a figure step out from the corner and move into firing position.The barrel of a gun reflected the fire  The shotgun Margolis had mentioned, the one Manning had said might not even work  Colin knocked Serena and the chair over and dove to block her in the same instant he heard the explosion.The shotgun had been fired from forty yards, pushing the maximum range, and Mannings aim had been high.The second shot was slightly more accurate.Colin felt the pellets tear through his shoulder and upper back, blood spilling.He went dizzy again, fighting to remain conscious as he blearily watched Manning start running for his car.There was no way Colin could catch him.Mannings figure receded and there was nothing Colin could do.He wondered why it was taking so long for the police to arrive and hoped theyd catch him.His thoughts were interrupted by a roar as fire suddenly mushroomed through the roof of the icehouse, alive and screaming, the sound almost deafening.Part of the wall exploded, sending burning pieces of wood and sparks in their direction.He could barely hear Serena crying through her coughs, and he realized they were still in danger, too close to the fire.There was no way Colin could drag her farther, but he could get help, and he forced himself to rise.He needed to get to a place where someone would see him.He staggered forward a few dozen steps, losing blood, his left arm and hand now useless, his nerve endings radiating agony.By then, Manning had reached his car and Colin saw the headlights flash on.The Camry tore away from the curb, heading directly toward him.And toward Serena.Colin knew he couldnt outrun the car; no way he could so much as dodge it.But Serena was even more helpless, and Manning knew exactly where she was.Gritting his teeth, Colin staggered forward as fast as he could, creating distance between him and Serena.Hoping Manning would follow him.Hoping Manning would flee.But the headlights remained aimed in Serenas direction.Not knowing what else to do, Colin stopped and began waving his right arm, trying to draw Mannings attention.He flipped Manning the bird.The Camry immediately veered away from Serena and toward Colin, accelerating and closing the distance.The icehouse continued to emit an eerie high pitched shriek as fire consumed it.Colin staggered as fast as he could away from Serena, knowing he had only a few more seconds, knowing he was about to die.The car was almost upon him when all at once, the ground in front of him was bathed in another set of headlights racing up from somewhere behind him.He barely saw the blur of Evans Prius as it crashed into the Camry with ear splitting force, pushing both cars toward the fire.The Camry smashed into the corner of the icehouse, the Prius bulldozing it forward.The roof of the building began to collapse as flames leaped farther upward, toward the sky.Colin tried to rush forward, but his legs gave out.Blood continued to pulse from his wounds, and as he lay on the ground, he could feel himself growing dizzy again.He could hear sirens now, competing with the sound of the fire.He suspected they were too late, that he wouldnt survive, but that didnt matter to him.He couldnt take his eyes from the Prius, and he watched for the door to open or for the window to go down.Evan and Lily could escape the fire if they moved fast, but the chances of that happening were slim.He had to get to them, and tried again to rise.Lifting his head nearly caused him to black out.He thought he saw swirling red and blue lights on the side streets and bright headlights moving closer.He heard panicked voices calling out for Serena and for him, and he wanted to shout at them that they should hurry, that Evan and Lily needed help, but all that came out was a raspy whisper.He heard Maria then, heard as she screamed his name and reached his side.Im here!she cried.Hold on!The ambulance is coming!Even then, Colin couldnt answer.Everything had begun to spin and images became disjointed, nothing making sense.In one instant, the Prius was swallowed whole by flames; when he blinked again, only half of the car was gone.He thought he saw the passenger door creak open, but there was too much smoke and there were no other signs of movement, and he couldnt be sure.He felt himself slipping away, darkness settling in, and in his last moment of consciousness, he prayed that the two best friends hed ever known would somehow make it out alive.EPILOGUE      April never ceased to surprise Maria.Though shed grown up in the South and knew what to expect, there were always a few glorious days, perfect days, when it seemed as though anything were possible.Cloudless blue skies would greet green lawns that had been brown all winter, and everything would suddenly explode with color.Dogwoods and cherry trees and azaleas would burst into life throughout the city, while tulips sprang forth from carefully tended gardens.Mornings were cool, but the days would warm up as the sun rose bright in the sky.Today was one of those ephemeral spring days, and as Maria stood on the carefully tended lawn, she could see Serena chatting animatedly with a group of people Maria didnt recognize, the smile on her face wide and joyful.Seeing her now, it was hard to believe that until recently, Serena had struggled to smile at all; shed suffered nightmares about her ordeal for months, and when shed looked in the mirror, shed seen bruises and cuts Manning had inflicted while shed been tied to the chair.Two of the cuts had left scars  one near her eye, the other on her jawline  but they were already beginning to fade.In another year, Maria doubted anyone would notice them at all, unless they knew exactly where to look.But that would also mean they would have to remember that horrible night, and with those memories there was always pain.It had been two weeks before Detective Wright, along with a still recuperating Pete Margolis, had met with Maria and admitted that Colin had been right about everything.The remains of Atkinsons body were found in what was left of the burned out icehouse.Ballistics testing eventually connected the bullet in Atkinsons head to the gun that had been in Lesters possession.The fire made it impossible to determine exactly when hed been killed, though investigators suspected that it was around the time hed vanished.They were able to determine that his body had been stored in a large, otherwise empty freezer in Dr.Mannings garage in Charlotte thanks to a few strands of Atkinsons hair found frozen to the sides.Research into Mannings bank accounts showed numerous cash disbursements, the numbers matching the amounts that had been transferred into Atkinsons accounts to pay his bills, and also confirmed the rental of the bungalow in Shallotte.Lesters fingerprints had been found in Atkinsons car, and investigators had hoped that Lester would provide even more answers.It was not to be.After spending three days in the infirmary under constant supervision, he was evaluated by a psychiatrist and deemed fit to be returned to a cell, subject to frequent monitoring.Later that afternoon, Lester met with his attorney, who reported that Lester, though heavily medicated and shaken by the loss of his father, seemed fairly lucid.Lester agreed to be interviewed by detectives the following day, as long as his attorney was present.He was returned to his cell and finished the tray of food that had been brought to him.Video recordings indicated that guards checked on him every fifteen to twenty minutes, but Lester nonetheless managed to hang himself, using strips from the bedsheet that hed tied together.By the time the guards found him, it was too late.Maria wondered sometimes whether Lester had truly been an accomplice or was simply another victim of Dr.Mannings.Or maybe even both.Pete Margolis admitted after he woke from his coma that he was unsure who had shot him.Dr.Manning had called out, telling him to come in, but Margolis saw only a brief glimpse of a gun barrel poking through the gap in a closet door before he was hit.The only thing Maria knew for sure was that Lester and Dr.Manning were both dead, and neither would ever come for her again.But despite what theyd done to her and to Serena, she sometimes felt flashes of grief and pity for the Manning family.A young son who died in an accident, an older sister murdered, a mother long struggling with depression who committed suicide She wondered who she would have become had those things happened to her, or had Serena died that night in the icehouse.Glancing over her shoulder, she surveyed the crowd that had gathered on the lawn and silently counted her blessings.Her mom and dad were managing to keep their protective instincts in check, her job with Jill was hugely satisfying, and shed used some of her severance package to refurnish her condo and buy a new wardrobe  and still had enough left over to start building a small nest egg.Last weekend, shed even wandered into a camera shop and fallen in love with a wildly expensive UV lens.The water was warming, too, her paddleboard calling to her      The wedding had been spectacular, though with Lily directing and stage managing, Maria had expected nothing less.While Wilmington would always be home, Maria could see that Charleston definitely had its charms.Lily was ethereal in her wedding dress, a confection of floating satin, tiny seed pearls, and fragile lace.Evan had been dreamy eyed as he stared at her during their vows at St.Michaels Church.The oldest religious structure in Charleston, it was the preferred wedding venue for the more aristocratic families of Charleston, but when Lily drawled, Why, I simply cant imagine why anyone would want to be married anywhere else, she somehow made it sound logical and sincere rather than snobbish.On that awful night, Lily had miraculously escaped unharmed.Evan had been less fortunate, however.Hed emerged with second degree burns on his back and a couple of broken bones in his leg.Hed been in a cast for nearly two months and had only recently begun walking without a limp again, in part due to his new exercise regime.His workouts werent quite up to Colins standards, but hed confided to Maria that hed been putting extra work in on his arms and was hoping Lily would notice on their honeymoon to the Bahamas.Theyd both had angels on their shoulders.Maria believed that as shed seen Lily and Evan emerge from the Prius, and though some people might laugh at the notion, she didnt care.She knew.Behind her, the wedding reception was in full swing, solemnity finally giving way to festivities.Lily had wanted the reception held at her parents spacious second home on the banks of the Ashley River, and as far as Maria could tell, no expense had been spared.A palatial white tent glowed with elaborately strung lights, and guests were dancing on a parquet floor before a ten piece band.The food had been catered by one of the finest restaurants in the city, and the spring flower arrangements were works of art.Maria knew shed never have a wedding like this; it wasnt her style.As long as she had her friends and family  and maybe a couple of piatas later for the younger guests  she would be happy.Not that she was thinking of getting married in the near future.The subject had yet to come up, and Maria had no intention of asking Colin about it directly.In most ways, Colin hadnt changed at all.Hed tell her the truth, and she wasnt sure she was ready to hear the answer.She might be inclined to hint if the opportunity presented itself, but even the thought of that sometimes made her nervous.Colin had only recently managed to resume his workout routine, but he was sometimes frustrated he wasnt able to do the things he used to do, including MMA training.He needed at least another six months, the doctors insisted.The shotgun blast had torn through part of his shoulder muscle, leaving vivid scars and a weakness that might be permanent.Hed already undergone one operation on his hand, and another was planned in a few more months.The injury that concerned the doctors most, however, had been the skull fracture, and hed spent four days in the ICU, near Pete Margolis.Margolis had been the first one to speak to Colin when he regained consciousness.They tell me you saved my life, Margolis had said to him.But dont think this changes anything about your deal.Im still going to keep an eye on you.Okay, Colin had managed to croak out.They also tell me that Dr.Manning beat the crap out of you, and that Evan ended up being the one who finally took him out.I find that very hard to imagine.Okay, Colin said again.My wife said you came to check on me.Said you were polite, too.And that my friend Larry apparently thinks youre pretty smart.His throat dry, Colin merely grunted this time.Margolis shook his head and sighed.Do me a favor and stay out of trouble.And one more thing.He finally cracked a smile.Thank you.Since then, Margolis hadnt dropped by to check on Colin even once.Maria sensed Colins approach and then felt his arm settle around her.She leaned into him.There you are, he said.I was looking for you.Its so beautiful by the water, she said.She turned, slipping her arms around him.Maria?he whispered into her hair.Would you do something for me?When she pulled back and looked at him quizzically, he went on.Id like you to meet my parents.Her eyes widened.Theyre here?Why didnt you tell me earlier?I wanted to talk to them first.See where we stand.And?Theyre good people.I told them about you.They asked if they could meet you, but I said Id have to check with you first.Of course Ill meet your parents.Why would you have to check with me?I wasnt sure what else to say.Ive never introduced them to a girl before.Never?Wow.That makes me feel pretty special.It should.You are.So lets go meet your parents.Since Im so special and youre crazy about me and you probably cant imagine living without me.In fact, you just might be thinking that Im the one, right?He smiled, his eyes never leaving hers.Okay.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS      Every novel presents its own unique set of challenges, and this novel was no different.As always, there are those whose help and support were invaluable to me as I

before you see the movie    Available now in paperback and ebook.One  May 1996  Tell me again why I agreed to help you with this.Matt, red faced and grunting, continued to push the spa toward the recently cut square at the far edge of the deck.His feet slipped, and he could feel sweat pouring from his forehead into the corners of his eyes, making them sting.It was hot, way too hot for early May.Too damn hot for this, thats for sure.Even Traviss dog, Moby, was hiding in the shade and panting, his tongue hanging out.Travis Parker, who was pushing the massive box alongside him, managed to shrug.Because you thought it would be fun, he said.He lowered his shoulder and shoved; the spa  which must have weighed four hundred pounds  moved another couple of inches.At this rate, the spa should be in place, oh sometime next week.This is ridiculous, Matt said, heaving his weight into the box, thinking that what they really needed was a team of mules.His back was killing him.For a moment, he visualized his ears blowing off the sides of his head from the strain, shooting in both directions like the bottle rockets he and Travis used to launch as kids.Youve already said that.And it isnt fun, Matt grunted.You said that, too.And it isnt going to be easy to install.Sure it is, Travis said.He stood and pointed to the lettering on the box.See?It says right here, Easy to Install.From his spot beneath the shady tree, Moby  a purebred boxer  barked as if in agreement, and Travis smiled, looking way too pleased with himself.Matt scowled, trying to catch his breath.He hated that look.Well, not always.Most of the time he enjoyed his friends boundless enthusiasm.But not today.Definitely not today.Matt reached for the bandanna in his rear pocket.It was soaked with sweat, which had of course done wonders for the seat of his pants.He wiped his face and wrung the bandanna with a quick twist.Sweat dribbled from it like a leaky faucet onto the top of his shoe.He stared at it almost hypnotically, before feeling it soak through the light mesh fabric, giving his toes a nice, slimy feel.Oh, that was just dandy, wasnt it?As I recall, you said Joe and Laird would be here to help us with your little project and that Megan and Allison would cook some burgers and wed have beer, and that  oh yeah, installing this thing should only take a couple of hours at the most.Theyre coming, Travis said.You said that four hours ago.They must be running a little late.Maybe you never called them at all.Of course I called them.And theyre bringing the kids, too.I promise.When?Soon.Uh huh, Matt answered.He stuffed the bandanna back in his pocket.And by the way  assuming they dont arrive soon, just how on earth do you think the two of us will be able to lower this thing into place?Travis dismissed the problem with a wave as he turned toward the box again.Well figure it out.Just think how well weve done so far.Were almost halfway there.Matt scowled again.It was Saturday  Saturday!His day of recreation and relaxation, his chance to escape from the grindstone, the break he earned after five days at the bank, the kind of day he needed.He was a loan officer, for Gods sake!He was supposed to push paper, not hot tubs!He could have been watching the Braves play the Dodgers!He could have been golfing!He could have gone to the beach!He could have slept in with Liz before heading to her parents house like they did almost every Saturday, instead of waking at the crack of dawn and performing manual labor for eight straight hours beneath a scalding southern sun  He paused.Who was he kidding?Had he not been here, he would have definitely spent the day with Lizs parents, which was, in all honesty, the main reason hed agreed to Traviss request in the first place.But that wasnt the point.The point was, he didnt need this.He really didnt.I dont need this, he said.I really dont.Travis didnt seem to hear him.His hands were already on the box, and he was getting into position.You ready?Matt lowered his shoulder, feeling bitter.His legs were shaking.Shaking!He already knew hed be in serious, double dose of Advil pain in the morning.Unlike Travis, he didnt make it into the gym four days a week or play racquetball or go running or go scuba diving in Aruba or surfing in Bali or skiing in Vail or anything else the guy did.This isnt fun, you know?Travis winked.You said that already, remember?Wow!Joe commented, lifting an eyebrow as he walked the perimeter of the hot tub.By then, the sun was beginning its descent, streams of gold reflecting off the bay.In the distance, a heron broke from the trees and gracefully skimmed the surface, dispersing the light.Joe and Megan, along with Laird and Allison, had arrived a few minutes before with kids in tow, and Travis was showing them around.This looks great!You two did all of this today?Travis nodded, holding his beer.It wasnt so bad, he said.I think Matt even enjoyed it.Joe glanced at Matt, who lay flattened in a lawn chair off to the side of the deck, a cold rag over his head.Even his belly  Matt had always been on the pudgy side  seemed to sag.I can see that.Was it heavy?Like an Egyptian sarcophagus!Matt croaked.One of those gold ones that only cranes can move!Joe laughed.Can the kids get in?Not yet.I just filled it, and the water will take a little while to heat up.The sun will help, though.The sun will heat it within minutes!Matt moaned.Within seconds!Joe grinned.Laird and the three of them had gone to school together since kindergarten.Tough day, Matt?Matt removed the rag and scowled at Joe.You have no idea.And thanks for showing up on time.Travis said to be here at five.If I had known you needed help, I would have come earlier.Matt slowly shifted his gaze to Travis.He really hated his friend sometimes.Hows Tina doing?Travis said, changing the subject.Is Megan getting any sleep?Megan was chatting with Allison at the table on the far end of the deck, and Joe glanced briefly in her direction.Some.Tinas cough is gone and shes been able to sleep through the night again, but sometimes I just think that Megan isnt wired to sleep.At least, not since she became a mom.She gets up even if Tina hasnt made a peep.Its like the quiet wakes her up.Shes a good mom, Travis said.She always has been.Joe turned to Matt.Wheres Liz?he asked.She should be here any minute, Matt answered, his voice floating up as if from the dead.She spent the day with her parents.Lovely, Joe commented.Be nice.Theyre good people.I seem to recall you saying that if you had to sit through one more of your father in laws stories about his prostate cancer or listen to your mother in law fret about Henry getting fired again  even though it wasnt his fault  you were going to stick your head in the oven.Matt struggled to sit up.I never said that!Yes, you did.Joe winked as Matts wife, Liz, rounded the corner of the house with Ben toddling just in front of her.But dont worry.I wont say a word.Matts eyes darted nervously from Liz to Joe and back again, checking to see if shed heard.Hey, yall!Liz called out with a friendly wave, leading little Ben by the hand.She made a beeline for Megan and Allison.Ben broke away and toddled toward the other kids in the yard.Joe saw Matt sigh in relief.He grinned and lowered his voice.So Matts in laws.Is that how you conned him into coming here?I might have mentioned it, Travis smirked.Joe laughed.What are you guys saying?Matt called out suspiciously.Nothing, they said in unison.Later, with the sun down and the food eaten, Moby curled up at Traviss feet.As he listened to the sound of the kids splashing away in the spa, Travis felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him.This was his favorite kind of evening, whiled away to the sound of shared laughter and familiar banter.One minute Allison was talking to Joe; the next minute she was chatting with Liz and then Laird or Matt; and so on for everyone seated around the outdoor table.No pretenses, no attempts to impress, no one trying to show anyone up.His life, he sometimes thought, resembled a beer commercial, and for the most part, he was content simply to ride the current of good feeling.Every now and then, one of the wives would get up to check on the kids.Laird, Joe, and Matt, on the other hand, reserved their child rearing duties at times like these to periodically raising their voices in hopes of calming down the kids or preventing them from teasing or accidentally hurting one another.Sure, one of the kids would throw a tantrum now and then, but most problems were solved with a quick kiss on a scraped knee or a hug that was as tender to watch from a distance as it must have been for the kid to receive.Travis looked around the table, pleased that his childhood friends not only had become good husbands and fathers, but were still a part of his life.It didnt always turn out that way.At thirty two, he knew that life was sometimes a gamble, and hed survived more than his share of accidents and falls, some of which should have inflicted far more serious bodily injury than they had.But it wasnt just that.Life was unpredictable.Others hed known growing up had already died in car accidents, been married and divorced, found themselves addicted to drugs or booze, or simply moved away from this tiny town, their faces already blurring in his memory.What were the odds that the four of them  whod known one another since kindergarten  would find themselves in their early thirties still spending weekends together?Pretty small, he thought.But somehow, after hanging together through all the adolescent acne and girl troubles and pressure from their parents, then heading off to four different colleges with differing career goals, they had each, one by one, moved back here to Beaufort.They were more like family than friends, right down to coded expressions and shared experiences that no outsiders could ever fully understand.And miraculously, the wives got along, too.Theyd come from different backgrounds and different parts of the state, but marriage, motherhood, and the endless gossip of small town America were more than enough to keep them chatting regularly on the phone and bonding like long lost sisters.Laird had been the first to marry  he and Allison had tied the knot the summer after they graduated from Wake Forest; Joe and Megan walked the aisle a year later, after falling in love during their senior year at North Carolina.Matt, whod gone to Duke, met Liz here in Beaufort, and they were married a year after that.Travis had been the best man in all three weddings.Some things had changed in the past few years, of course, largely because of the new additions to the families.Laird wasnt always available to go mountain biking, Joe couldnt join Travis on the spur of the moment to go skiing in Colorado as he used to, and Matt had all but given up trying to keep up with him on most things.But that was okay.They were all still available enough, and among the three of them  and with enough planning  he was still able to make the most of his weekends.Lost in thought, Travis hadnt realized that the conversation had lapsed.Did I miss something?I asked if youd talked to Monica lately, Megan said, her tone letting Travis know he was in trouble.All six of them, he thought, took a bit too much interest in his love life.The trouble with married people was that they seemed to believe that everyone they knew should get married.Every woman Travis dated was thus subjected to subtle, though unyielding, evaluation, especially by Megan.She was usually the ringleader at moments like these, always trying to figure out what made Travis tick when it came to women.And Travis, of course, loved nothing more than to push her buttons in return.Not recently, he said.Why not?Shes nice.Shes also more than a little neurotic, Travis thought.But that was beside the point.She broke up with me, remember?So?It doesnt mean she doesnt want you to call.I thought thats exactly what it meant.Megan, along with Allison and Liz, stared at him as if he were just plain dense.The guys, as usual, seemed to be enjoying this.It was a regular feature of their evenings.But you were fighting, right?So?Did you ever think she might have simply broken up with you because she was angry?I was angry, too.Why?She wanted me to see a therapist.And let me guess  you said you didnt need to see one.The day I need to see a therapist is the day you see me hike up my skirt and crochet some mittens.Joe and Laird laughed, but Megans eyebrows shot up.Megan, they all knew, watched Oprah nearly every day.You dont think men need therapy?I know I dont.But generally speaking?Since Im not a general, I really couldnt say.Megan leaned back in her chair.I think Monica might be on to something.If you ask me, I think you have commitment issues.Then Ill make sure not to ask you.Megan leaned forward.Whats the longest youve ever dated someone?Two months?Four months?Travis pondered the question.I dated Olivia for almost a year.I dont think shes talking about high school, Laird cracked.Occasionally, his friends enjoyed throwing him under the bus, so to speak.Thanks, Laird, Travis said.What are friends for?Youre changing the subject, Megan reminded him.Travis drummed his fingers on his leg.I guess Id have to say I cant remember.In other words, not long enough to remember?What can I say?Ive yet to meet any woman who could measure up to any of you.Despite the growing darkness, he could tell she was pleased by his words.Hed learned long ago that flattery was his best defense at moments like these, especially since it was usually sincere.Megan, Liz, and Allison were terrific.All heart and loyalty and generous common sense.Well, just so you know, I like her, she said.Yeah, but you like everyone I date.No, I dont.I didnt like Leslie.None of the wives had liked Leslie.Matt, Laird, and Joe, on the other hand, hadnt minded her company at all, especially when she wore her bikini.She was definitely a beauty, and while she wasnt the type hed ever marry, theyd had a lot of fun while it lasted.Im just saying that I think you should give her a call, she persisted.Ill think about it, he said, knowing he wouldnt.He rose from the table, angling for an escape.Anyone need another beer?Joe and Laird lifted their bottles in unison; the others shook their heads.Travis started for the cooler before hesitating near the sliding glass door of his house.He darted inside and changed the CD, listening to the strains of new music filtering out over the yard as he brought the beers back to the table.By then, Megan, Allison, and Liz were already chatting about Gwen, the woman who did their hair.Gwen always had good stories, many of which concerned the illicit predilections of the towns citizens.Travis nursed his beer silently, looking out over the water.What are you thinking about?Laird asked.Its not important.What is it?Travis turned toward him.Did you ever notice how some colors are used for peoples names but others arent?What are you talking about?White and Black.Like Mr.White, the guy who owns the tire store.And Mr.Black, our third grade teacher.Or even Mr.Green from the game Clue.But you never hear of someone named Mr.Orange or Mr.Yellow.Its like some colors make good names, but other colors just sound stupid.You know what I mean?I cant say Ive ever thought about it.Me neither.Not until just a minute ago, I mean.But its kind of strange, isnt it?Sure, Laird finally agreed.Both men were quiet for a moment.I told you it wasnt important.Yes, you did.Was I right?Yep.When little Josie had her second temper tantrum in a fifteen minute span  it was a little before nine  Allison scooped her into her arms and gave Laird the look, the one that said it was time to go so they could get the kids in bed.Laird didnt bother arguing, and when he stood up from the table, Megan glanced at Joe, Liz nodded at Matt, and Travis knew the evening was at an end.Parents might believe themselves to be the bosses, but in the end it was the kids who made the rules.He supposed he could have tried to talk one of his friends into staying, and might even have gotten one to agree, but he had long since grown accustomed to the fact that his friends lived their lives by a different schedule from his.Besides, he had a sneaking suspicion that Stephanie, his younger sister, might swing by later.She was coming in from Chapel Hill, where she was working toward a masters degree in biochemistry.Though she would stay at their parents place, she was usually wired after the drive and in the mood to talk, and their parents would already be in bed.Megan, Joe, and Liz rose and started to clean up the table, but Travis waved them off.Ill get it in a while.No big deal.A few minutes later, two SUVs and a minivan were being loaded with children.Travis stood on the front porch and waved as they pulled out of the driveway.When they were gone, Travis wandered back to the stereo, sorted through the CDs again, and chose Tattoo You by the Rolling Stones, then cranked up the volume.He pulled at another beer on his way back to his chair, threw his feet up on the table, and leaned back.Moby sat beside him.Just you and me for a while, he said.What time do you think Stephanie will be rolling in?Moby turned away.Unless Travis said the words walk or ball or go for a ride or come get a bone, Moby wasnt much interested in anything he had to say.Do you think I should call her to see if shes on her way yet?Moby continued to stare.Yeah, thats what I thought.Shell get here when she gets here.He sat drinking his beer and stared out over the water.Behind him, Moby whined.You want to go get your ball?he finally said.Moby stood so quickly, he almost knocked over the chair.It was the music, she thought, that proved to be the clincher in what had already been one of the most miserable weeks of her life.Loud music.Okay, nine oclock on a Saturday night wasnt so bad, especially since he obviously had company, and ten oclock wasnt all that unreasonable, either.But eleven oclock?When he was alone and playing fetch with his dog?From her back deck, she could see him just sitting there in the same shorts hed worn all day, feet on the table, tossing the ball and staring at the river.What on earth could he be thinking?Maybe she shouldnt be so hard on him; she should simply ignore him.It was his house, right?King of the castle and all that.He could do what he wanted.But that wasnt the problem.The problem was that he had neighbors, including her, and she had a castle, too, and neighbors were supposed to be considerate.And truth be told, hed crossed the line.Not just because of the music.In all honesty, she liked the music he was listening to and usually didnt really care how loud or how long he played it.The problem was with his dog, Nobby, or whatever he called him.More specifically, what his dog had done to her dog.Molly, she was certain, was pregnant.Molly, her beautiful, sweet, purebred collie of prize winning lineage  the first thing shed bought herself after finishing her physician assistant rotations at the Eastern Virginia School of Medicine and the kind of dog shed always wanted  had noticeably gained weight during the last couple of weeks.Even more alarming, she noticed that Mollys nipples seemed to be growing.She could feel them now whenever Molly rolled over to have her tummy scratched.And she was moving more slowly, too.Add it up, and Molly was definitely on her way to birthing a litter of puppies that no one on earth was ever going to want.A boxer and a collie?Unconsciously she squinched up her face as she tried to imagine how the puppies would look before finally forcing the thought away.It had to be that mans dog.When Molly was in heat, that dog had practically staked out her house like a private detective, and he was the only dog shed seen wandering around the neighborhood in weeks.But would her neighbor even consider fencing his yard?Or keeping the dog inside?Or setting up a dog run?No.His motto seemed to be My dog shall be free!It didnt surprise her.He seemed to live his own life by the same irresponsible motto.On her way to work, she saw him running, and when she got back, he was out biking or kayaking or in line skating or shooting baskets in his front drive with a group of neighborhood kids.A month ago, hed put his boat in the water, and now he was wakeboarding as well.As if the man werent active enough already.God forbid the man should work a minute of overtime, and she knew that he didnt work at all on Fridays.And what kind of job let you head off every day wearing jeans and T shirts?She had no idea, but she suspected  with a grim sort of satisfaction  that it more than likely required an apron and name tag.Okay, maybe she wasnt being entirely fair.He was probably a nice guy.His friends  who appeared normal enough and had kids to boot  seemed to enjoy his company and were over there all the time.She realized shed even seen a couple of them at the office before, when their kids had come in with the sniffles or an ear infection.But what about Molly?Molly was sitting near the back door, her tail thumping, and Gabby felt anxious at the thought of the future.Molly would be okay, but what about the puppies?What was going to happen to them?What if no one wanted them?She couldnt imagine taking them to the pound or the SPCA or whatever it was they called it here, to be put to sleep.She couldnt do that.She wouldnt do that.She wasnt going to have them murdered.But what, then, was she going to do with the puppies?It was all his fault, and he was just sitting there on his deck with his feet propped up, acting as if he didnt have a care in the world.This wasnt what shed dreamed about when shed first seen the house earlier this year.Even though it wasnt in Morehead City, where her boyfriend, Kevin, lived, it was just minutes across the bridge.It was small and almost half a century old and a definite fixer upper by Beaufort standards, but the view along the creek was spectacular, the yard was big enough for Molly to run, and best of all, she could afford it.Just barely, what with all the loans shed taken out for PA school, but loan officers were pretty understanding when it came to making loans to people like her.Professional, educated people.Not like Mr.My Dog Shall Be Free and I Dont Work Fridays.She drew a deep breath, reminding herself again that the man might be a nice guy.He always waved to her whenever he saw her pulling in from work, and she vaguely remembered that hed dropped off a basket of cheese and wine to welcome her to the neighborhood when shed moved in a couple of months back.She hadnt been home, but hed left it on the porch, and shed promised herself that shed send a thank you note, one that she never quite got around to writing.Her face squinched unconsciously again.So much for moral superiority.Okay, she wasnt perfect, either, but this wasnt about a forgotten thank you note.This was about Molly and that mans wandering dog and unwanted puppies, and now was as good a time as any for them to discuss the situation.He was obviously awake.She stepped off the back deck and started toward the tall row of hedges that separated his house from hers.Part of her wished Kevin were with her, but that wasnt going to happen.Not after their spat this morning, which started after shed casually mentioned that her cousin was getting married.Kevin, buried in the sports section of the newspaper, hadnt said a word in response, preferring to act as if he hadnt heard her.Anything about marriage made the man get as quiet as a stone, especially lately.She supposed she shouldnt have been surprised  theyd been dating almost four years (a year less than her cousin, she was tempted to point out), and if shed learned one thing about him, it was that if Kevin found a topic uncomfortable, then more than likely he wouldnt say anything at all.But Kevin wasnt the problem.Nor was the fact that lately she felt as though her life werent quite what shed imagined it would be.And it wasnt the terrible week at the office, either, one in which shed been puked on three  three!times on Friday alone, which was an all time office record, at least according to the nurses, who didnt bother to hide their smirks and repeated the story with glee.Nor was she angry about Adrian Melton, the married doctor at her office who liked to touch her whenever they spoke, his hand lingering just a bit too long for comfort.And she surely wasnt angry at the fact that through it all, she hadnt once stood up for herself.Nosiree, this had to do with Mr.Party being a responsible neighbor, one who was going to own up to the fact that he had as much of a duty to find a solution to their problem as she did.And while she was letting him know that, maybe shed mention that it was a little late for him to be blaring his music (even if she did like it), just to let him know she was serious.As Gabby marched through the grass, the dew moistened the tips of her toes through her sandals and the moonlight reflected on the lawn like silver trails.Trying to figure out exactly where to begin, she barely noticed.Courtesy dictated that she head first to the front door and knock, but with the music roaring, she doubted hed even be able to hear it.Besides, she wanted to get this over with while she was still worked up and willing to confront him head on.Up ahead, she spotted an opening in the hedges and headed toward it.It was probably the same one that Nobby snuck through to take advantage of poor, sweet Molly.Her heart squeezed again, and this time she tried to hold on to the feeling.This was important.Very important.Focused as she was on her mission, she didnt notice the tennis ball come flying toward her just as she emerged from the opening.She did, however, distantly register the sound of the dog galloping toward her  but only distantly  a second before she was bowled over and hit the ground.
