Well, now that she no longer worked for her father, maybe a little personal expression would be in order.She smiled at the very thought of it.A few of Rosies waitresses had obvious piercings and a few tattoos, so Kari doubted shed object to a couple strands of hair in an unusual color.Later.When she could finally afford something other than necessities.As she turned onto Rainbow Way, she passed a thirty something man with a camera taking photos in the direction of the gazebo.A second later, she realized he was the guy whod wanted her to pose for pictures at Rosies.After she walked by, she looked back over her shoulder to see him taking one more photo, this time of her.Then he gave her a friendly smile.Normally she didnt object to a mans admiring gaze, but now she felt self conscious.After all, what was there to appreciate when she was wearing a pair of turquoise capris, which were cute, and Angelas beat up sneakers, which werent?It was like wearing a cocktail dress with flip flops.Most men had no fashion sense whatsoever, but she was sure this one was appalled at her lack of it.Doesnt matter.Beats blisters.Keep walking.When she reached the sign Bonnie had talked about, she made a left onto a brick path that wound through the trees.When the trees finally parted, Kari stepped onto a deck that was cantilevered over a precipitous drop off.Beyond it, tree covered hills rolled and crisscrossed, lit by the golden glow of the afternoon sun.It looked almost too beautiful to be real.Nina sat on a park bench on the cantilevered deck, staring out across the valley.A bulldog lay at her feet, relaxing in the warm stillness of the afternoon.Hi, Kari said.Nina turned around, and a smile came to her face.Kari!Hi.Mind if I sit down?Not at all.Kari sat next to Nina.Bonnie told me you were here.I just wanted to thank you for the stuff you sent over.You didnt have to do that.I just thought you might be able to use a few things you might not buy for yourself right now.It was really nice.Thank you.Kari looked across the valley.Its pretty here.I had no idea Rainbow Valley even existed.Its a nice place to live.Im glad youll be staying for a while.So am I.  She leaned over and petted the bulldog, who panted his approval.And this must be Manfred.Bonnie said he came on this walk with you.Yeah.Hes such a sweet dog.Nina smiled.Curtis and I adopted him from the animal shelter when he was just a puppy.Thats beenlets see.Eleven years ago.Kari glanced down at the ring Nina wore.Curtis?Your husband?Yeah.She paused, a melancholy expression passing over her face.He died last year.Kari felt a stab of sympathy.I didnt know.Im so sorry.He worked at the power plant near Waymark.There was an accident.He lived for a few days, but he just couldnt hang on.Ninas eyes grew misty.He tried so hard, but he just couldnt.That must have been so difficult for you.It was.I dont know what Id have done without Marc.He told me to stay home from the shop as long as I needed to, that hed take care of everything.And he did.I still dont know how he ran the shop and the vineyard at the same time.Kari smiled.It was just as Nina had said.When the going got tough, Marc was the guy you wanted in your corner.Hes offered to do some work around my house, Nina went on.Help me get it on the market.I hate going home to all that empty space by myself every night, so I really should move.But there are just too many memories.She wiped her fingertips beneath her eyes.Im sorry.Im just feeling a little emotional.Today is our anniversary.Your anniversary?Kari said.Oh, Im sorry!I wish Id known.I shouldnt have come down here.You probably wanted to be alone.Actually, Im glad you showed up.Keeps me from crying so much I screw up my mascara.You must really miss Curtis, Kari said.Yeah.And now Manfred is getting on in years.The vet says he has liver disease.Theres nothing he can do, so it probably wont be very long before he She stopped for a moment, swallowing hard.I dont know what Im going to do when he leaves me, too.She reached down to stroke Manfreds head.Hes such a good dog.Some people say animals have no soul, but theyre dead wrong.This dog has a soul.Manfred looked up at Nina, his eyes adoring and perceptive at the same time.Kari had never really thought about whether animals had souls before, but looking at Manfred now, she had a feeling Nina was right.Nina glanced at her watch and wiped her eyes again.Oh, shoot.Look at the time.I told Bonnie Id be back in half an hour.And here Ive talked your ear off.She smiled at Kari.Thanks for listening.It was nice to be able to talk about Curtis.Particularly today.It was nice to hear about him.Its hard talking to Marc and Daniel about him.Men.They never know what to say.Especially Marc.I know he cares, but Nina smiled and shook her head.Sometimes he is so clueless.Then she glanced at the valley one last time, that melancholy expression coming over her face again.Curtis is out there, you know.What do you mean?In his last hours, he talked about Manfred.He said he was going to wait for him at the Rainbow Bridge.And then he said the two of them would wait for me.Is that the way it works?Kari said.Can people wait there, too?I dont know.I think maybe the Rainbow Bridge works any way you need it to.I like thinking about Curtis being down there with the animals, healthy again, waiting for us.She let out a shaky sigh, and tears filled her eyes again.Or maybe it was just his way of telling me hell love me forever.Kari couldnt imagine loving a man that much and then losing him.But still she knew that kind of love had to be worth every bit of the anguish somebody would have to face when they lost it.12    Just think about the cost savings if we didnt have to store and replace barrels, Daniel said.Damned things are expensive.Micro oxygenation will solve that problem.As Daniel looked up at the stacks of oak barrels he deemed to be archaic and useless, Marc fought to hold his temper, but it wasnt a battle he was sure he could win.When they were at City Limits and Daniel talked about tweaking the aging process, Marc had no idea he was talking about this.Have you priced those barrels lately?Daniel asked.Doesnt matter, Marc said.We have to have them.From France?Seriously?The morning sunlight angled through the door, casting a warm glow across the weathered wood.Yes, the barrels came from France, but only because that was where a vintner went if he wanted the best money could buy.If the best barrels came from the bottom of the ocean, Marc would find a way to excavate them.Theyre not necessary, Daniel said.We could use tanks instead.Stick a few oak chips in them, and bam!Instant oak flavoring.So you want our wine to have fake oak flavoring?If the consumer cant tell the difference, why not?Ill know the difference.A lot of vineyards are using the process, Daniel said.Good ones.Its not that out of the mainstream.Our goal isnt to be mainstream.Mainstream is average.Our wine is not average.But itll speed up the process.We can get the wine out the door a whole lot faster.This isnt about speed.It could be.And think of the control well have over the process.All the tanks will be linked together.Their lines will be thermostatically monitored during fermentation, and the whole thing will be computer controlled.So you figure as long as you hook something up to a computer, its automatically faster and better?Generally, yeah.Only makes sense.Wine making isnt about fast and cheap and fake, so get this micro oxygenation thing out of your head.If you understood it better, then maybe  Understood it better?Are you serious?I understand it completely.Its a half ass way of making wine, and Im not interested.I cant even imagine what Dad would have to say about it.Daniel shook his head slowly, as if he couldnt believe his brother was being such an idiot.Heres a news flash, Marc.Sometimes our father was a real asshole.With that, he strode away, waving his hand dismissively.Marc gritted his teeth, wishing he could deck his brother for saying that, then toss in a few extra whacks to knock some sense into him.Their father had been strict.No argument there.Sometimes a little intolerant.But Marc had respected him in a way that Daniel never had.And it was because Marc had always seen Cordero Vineyards as a living, breathing entity that required a firm hand and fierce determination to keep it alive.This place had history.Every vine, every furrow of dirt, every grape they cultivated was because of something their grandfather had started decades ago and their father had carried on.Marc wasnt sure his brother understood any of that.When Daniel spent a day working in the vineyard and then looked at the dirt beneath his fingernails, what did he feel?An age old sense of purpose that carried him through from one exhausting day to the next or the need to take a shower so he could head to town and pick up women?When the grapes ripened to the point of bursting, did he feel a sense of pride in nurturing the vines to produce another stellar crop or cringe at the backbreaking labor required to harvest them?Marc was starting to face the truth.If he handed the management of Cordero Vineyards over to Daniel and left Rainbow Valley, when he returned he might not even recognize the place his father had entrusted to him all those years ago.When she got back to the vineyard that afternoon, Kari looked out the kitchen window and saw a big black truck parked on the driveway near the barn.She went out the door for a better look, and Boo followed her.He ran to the edge of the deck and looked down the hill to the grape arbor.Two women and a man stood near it.After a moment Kari realized it was Shannon and Nina, along with a man she didnt know.On a leash beside them was a big black and white dog.Boo barked, then ran down the stairs and galloped toward the other dog.The big dog spun around and came to attention.He was four times the size of Boo, with jaws like a T.  rexs.Pit bull?If so, hed be able to gobble Boo up in a single bite.A little worried, Kari ran down the stairs toward the grape arbor, but fortunately all the dogs were doing was circling and sniffing the way dogs did when they were interested in each other, not what they did when one was considering having the other one for lunch.Hi, Kari!Shannon said.Im sorry, Kari said.Boo got away from me.No problem.He and Fluffy are getting along just fine.Kari looked at the dogs sleek black and white coat.His name is Fluffy?Whats the matter?the man said.You dont think he looks like a Fluffy?Uh  Luke named him that just to annoy me, Shannon said with a smile.Kari, this is Luke Dawson.My fianc.Kari shook his hand.Nice to meet you.Boos a little doll, Shannon said, smiling down at him.Is he a cairn terrier?Mostly, I think, Kari said.Marc thinks he looks like a rag mop.Nina rolled her eyes.Marc thinks a dog isnt a dog unless its the size of the Titanic and keeps rabbits out of a vineyard.She turned to Shannon and Luke.So whats it going to be on the arbor, guys?Tulle or ribbons?She held up a sample of both.I like the fluffy stuff, Luke said.But the ribbons add color, Shannon said.Then get colored fluffy stuff.That would look like cotton candy.You love cotton candy, Luke said.Sure I do.Just not draped over a grape arbor.Fluffy likes the fluffy stuff, Luke said.The only thing Fluffy likes right now is Boo, Shannon said, watching the dogs play together.Well have to check with him later about the tulle.She turned to Kari.What do you think?Ribbons or tulle?Kari smiled.Now, whatever I say, Im going to ruffle somebodys feathers.Maybe Id better just go.Can I go with you?Luke asked.Shannon smacked him on the arm.He gave her a grin and hauled her up next to him for a kiss.Sweetheart, if you want burlap bags hanging off that thing, well have burlap bags.Shannon looked over her shoulder at Nina.How about both?Look at that, Nina said.Already you have marital harmony, and youre not even married.Good, Luke said.Its settled.Gotta go now.We have a million things to do at the shelter.Since when are you dying to scoop poop?Shannon asked.Since you made me come here to talk about crap like tulle and ribbons.Shannon rolled her eyes, then turned to Nina.Thanks.Well be in touch about the menu.Kari grabbed Boo so he wouldnt follow them.Luke took Shannons hand, and they walked back up the hill, Fluffy trotting along beside them.When they reached the truck, Luke opened the passenger door for Shannon.But before he let her into the truck, he pressed her up against it and kissed her, and it wasnt just a peck on the cheek.Fluffy watched as if he was crazy about both of them.Theyre really in love, Nina said quietly.You dont see that every day.No, Kari said, feeling a tug of envy.You dont.They knew each other in high school.Met again when Luke came back to Rainbow Valley last year.Nina smiled.I like that.It supports my theory about love.Which is?That for every woman, theres one man shes destined to be with.Shannon and Luke never forgot about each other because they were destined to be together.Kari liked the sound of that.She was pretty sure shed run away from her own wedding because she was destined not to be with Greg.So that left the gate open for her own soul mate to walk through.She had a passing thought about Marc maybe being that man, then brushed it away.What had their agreement been?Hot sex with no strings attached?No forevers there.Curtis and I were married here, Nina said.Right there under the arbor.Kari heard the same melancholy tone in Ninas voice that had been there when they were at the Overlook.I can see why.Its a perfect place for a wedding.Our father was gone by then, so Marc gave me away.Walked me up the aisle.Put my hand in Curtiss.For several moments, she stared at the arbor, as if she was reliving everything in her mind.Then a smile crossed her lips.It rained that day.Can you believe it?Oh, no!On your wedding day?Right in the middle of the ceremony.The storm blew up out of nowhere.Father Andrews kept talking faster and faster.Hed just made it to you may kiss the bride when the heavens opened up.It only lasted a few minutes, but everybody was drenched.Nina smiled wistfully.I didnt care.I was a married woman.Since the day I met Curtis, that was all I wanted to be.Kari couldnt help thinking that if shed gone through with her own wedding and something like that had happened, Hilda the wedding planner would have shot herself right in front of three hundred waterlogged guests.Sometimes I wonder what will happen to this place if we end up selling it, Nina said.I can walk out here now and remember all of it like it was yesterday.But what will I do if its gone?You have photos, right?Its not the same thing.Out here I can hear Curtiss voice.Its as if the breeze is carrying it right to me.Then Nina laughed a little, waving her hand.Dont listen to me.I sound crazy as a loon.No.She didnt sound crazy.She sounded like a woman in love.But how heartbreaking was it that she had to wait until the next world to finally be with the man she was in love with?Over the next week, Marc and Kari fell into a routine of work and play that Marc decided he really liked.If Kari had the early shift and was home in the afternoon, shed make dinner for him and Daniel.If she had the late shift and didnt get home until eight thirty or nine, she grabbed something to eat at Rosies.Then when she got home, either they watched TV together for a while or they went straight to bed.On the nights she left town after dark to come home, if she was more than a few minutes late, he found himself looking at his watch and worrying until he finally heard her at the door.On Friday afternoon, Marc made a run to the shop to deliver a dozen cases of wine and got stuck in town longer than he planned.When he finally got home and came into the kitchen, Kari was standing at the stove with her back to him, stirring a big potful of something he couldnt identify, but it smelled great.She had her iPod plugged into a set of small external speakers shed intended to take on her honeymoon with her.The music she played wasnt music at all, just a big blur of incomprehensible noise that usually annoyed the crap out of him.But the moment he saw her long legs protruding from a pair of very short shorts, all the blood in his head went south and he just didnt give a damn.Sorry I wasnt home sooner, he told her.The idiot Lola hired to put some new shelves up in her shop skipped out without finishing the job.Lola?Of Lolas Pet Emporium.Kari laid the spoon down and faced him.So you finished it?It didnt take long.All I had to do was  And that was when he saw it.A two inch strip of bright pink running the length of Karis hair, from her part to the curly tips.He stopped short and stared at it.What the hell?Just then Daniel came into the kitchen.Whoa, he said with a smile.Good choice.Love the pink.Why, thank you, Kari said, returning his smile.Then she looked at Marc.What do you think?Daniel grinned.This should be good.He turned to Marc.So.Tell Kari what you think of her hair.The pinks nice, he said.Thats all?Daniel said, looking disappointed.Angela put on a temporary tattoo once, and you launched into a ten minute lecture before you realized it wasnt permanent.This isnt permanent, either, Kari said.I borrowed a box of Jell O from the pantry.Jell O?Marc said.It dyes hair temporarily.I decided to do something a little crazy.Actually, when Marc looked at that pink streak, he saw Kari through and through.Yeah, it was a little wild, but so what?Hed learned to go along with whatever Karis whim of the moment was, because it eventually resulted in the kind of cataclysmic sex that knocked him senseless, and that was worth every crazy idea she had.The shower.The floor.Her on top.Up against the wall.He didnt care.So if she wanted to put a pink streak in her hair because she liked doing crazy things, why in the world would he object?Marc headed to the pantry and grabbed some snack crackers, then sat down at the table and opened the box.Hey!Kari said.What are you doing?Dinners almost ready.Im hungry.Put away the crackers.Its an insult to the chef to eat five minutes before dinner is served.Its an appetizer.Marc held out the box to Daniel.Cracker?Nope, Daniel said.Im on my way out.I have a date.Already?Marc said.Ive been here two weeks, Daniel said.I guess its not surprising, Marc said.Quasimodo could drive down Rainbow Way in a Porsche 911 and get a date.So think how fast I can do it with this handsome face, Daniel said, heading for the door.Later, guys.As the door closed behind him, Kari said, Are you sure you two are brothers?Thats what Ive been told, but Ive never believed it.Marc ate another cracker, then closed the box.Our father used to wonder the same thing.Daniel drove him nuts.How so?All Daniel wanted to do was play video games and poke around on his computer.And he hated working in the vineyard.That crawled all over our father like nothing else.But hes going to run it for the next three years?That was our deal, Marc said, sticking the cracker box back into the pantry.But Im going to have to set him straight about a few things first.Like what?He has this crazy idea about aging the wine with micro oxygenation.Whats that?Its a half ass way of making wine.I should have known he was going to go off on some weird tangent.Hmm.The app he created must have been pretty amazing for him to make so much money from it.Marcs brow crinkled.What has that got to do with anything?Hes an idea guy.Hes telling you his ideas.His ideas are nuts.Uh huh.So were the Wright brothers.And Einsteins.And Steve Jobss.Hes hardly in that company.Its the way hes wired, though.To come up with better ways of doing things.Wine making isnt as much about innovation as it is about tradition.Tradition is important.But change is good, too, isnt it?As long as its for the better?Micro oxygenation is not for the better.Daniel has a hard time turning his brain off.He wants to tell you every time he has a new idea.Just talk to him about it.Make him feel as if youre listening.Hes wrong.Just listen.Fine.Then Ill tell him hes wrong.Its official.Youre the most stubborn man Ive ever met.But he was also right.Hed spent his entire adult life keeping alive the tradition his grandfather had begun and his father had guarded and passed on to him.And now Daniel was going to screw it up?Invitations came today for Luke and Shannons wedding, Kari said, still stirring.They sent me one, too.Yeah?Thats nice.Isnt it?I love weddings.You know.Unless its me getting married to Greg.Oh!You know what I was thinking?What?Since Nina, Daniel, and Angela will all be here for the wedding, maybe we could have dinner here afterward.Nina and Daniel would love it, Marc said.Im not too sure about Angela.I havent told her were seeing each other yet.I know.You wont hurt my feelings if you dont want to include me.No.Actually, I think its a great idea.It would be a good opportunity for you to meet each other.Great!And since Nina will be busy with the wedding, Id be happy to cook something.Oh!Kari hurried over to her iPod.I love this song!She jacked up the volume, and some god awful rap song reverberated through the kitchen, but he didnt care.All he cared about was watching Kari.She went back to the pot on the stove, where she continued to stir it as she rocked her head back and forth to the music, singing along in a voice that was never going to make her a star, that gorgeous head of curly auburn hair and its pink streak bouncing along with it.She was so full of life, making Marc feel as if he was bursting beyond the straight and narrow path hed been trudging along for the past eighteen years, showing him things along the way hed never seen before.He slipped up behind her, put his arm around her waist, and pulled her back against him.God, she felt good.Smelled even better.He gave her a kiss on the neck.She stopped stirring, laid the spoon on the counter, and turned in his arms.So with Daniel gone, we have the house to ourselves, right?Right.Ever do it on a kitchen table?she asked.Cant say that I have.She went to the table and boosted herself up on it.Then she grabbed him by the collar and pulled him between her thighs.He spread his hands on her waist and leaned in to kiss her as she looped her arms around his neck.We only have about five minutes, she said against his lips, or the waters going to boil out of that pot.Maybe we should turn the burner off.Maybe we should take off our clothes and get on with it.Yes, maam.Marc unbuttoned her shirt as she unfastened his belt.Buttons werent quite the challenge for him that they used to be, but the bottom one on this shirt was giving him problems.Ticktock, Kari said.Or dinner will be ruined.You dont want dinner to be ruined, do you?With a growl of frustration, he finally unfastened it and shoved her shirt open, pleased to see she wasnt wearing a bra.He took her breasts in his hands, marveling one more time at their sheer perfection.As he dove in for another kiss, she pulled his belt out of its loops, flung it aside, and started on the buttons of his jeans.The beat of the music pounded inside his head, and he had to admit that sex and rap actually went together pretty well, particularly since this time it was all about speed.He had a condom in his pocket and a hard on for the record books, so if she wanted it fast, that was exactly what she was going to get.Then all at once, Marc heard something behind him.The back door?His sex fogged brain told him it must be Daniel coming back.But before he could dislodge his lips from Karis, he heard a gasp.Then came a voice that clearly wasnt his brothers.Dad?What are you doing?13    Marc whipped around to find Angela standing at the back door.Angela?Angela?At first he was so dumbfounded he couldnt move.But then he sprang into action, yanking the sides of Karis shirt back together.As she buttoned it, he reached over and killed the music.Big mistake.The dead silence was worse.Angela just stood there with her mouth hanging open.Finally she swept past them, walking through the kitchen to the entryway.Then Marc heard her footsteps as she ran up the stairs.Wheres she going?Kari asked.I imagine shes going to her bedroom.But my stuff is stilluh oh.What do we do now?Marc didnt answer.He couldnt answer, because he had no idea what to say.Kari had just buttoned her shirt about the time Angela marched back down the stairs.Instead of coming back to the kitchen, though, she made a beeline to the front door.Marc heard it open, then slam closed.Crap, he muttered.I guess I need to go talk to her.What do you want me to do?Just stay here.Ill get my stuff.Go back down to the cottage.No!Not yet.I dont want you down there until we find out what was going on the other night.Stay right here until I talk to her.Marc strode out of the kitchen to the front door.He stood with his hand on the doorknob and took a deep, calming breath that didnt calm him in the least.Then he opened the door and stepped out onto the porch.Angela sat on the porch swing, rocking it with her toe, her arms folded, staring straight ahead.I wish youd called first, he said.So thats the way it is now?I have to call before I come back to my own house?Marc sat down beside her.Ive never seen her before, Angela said.Who is she?Her name is Kari Worthington.Shes new in town.Youre my father.Thats right.That was really creepy.He blew out a breath.Okay.I can understand why youd feel that way.Stop being all understanding.Thats not like you.Im not understanding?Not like that.You sound like one of those TV shrinks.Validating my feelings, and all that.This is weird enough already.Well, hell.The truth was that he didnt know how to behave in a situation like this.But hadnt her whole childhood and adolescence been filled with situations where he didnt know how to behave?Why was this any different?Because his daughter had seen him on the verge of having sex on the kitchen table.Yeah, that was pretty different.Why did you come home?he asked her.Is it so wrong for me to want to see my family?Well, no, but classes have barely started.You said Uncle Daniel is here.I wanted to see him.Hes out tonight.Her lips tightened, and he could tell she was trying not to cry.Great.He thought about apologizing, only to stop himself.There really wasnt anything to apologize for.He hadnt done anything wrong.Of course, he would have preferred that she hadnt seen that particular thing hed been doing that wasnt wrong, but now he was just going to have to deal with it.Kim and I had a fight, she said finally.Your roommate?I thought you were getting along.We were.For a while.But then she started staying up late.Like, till one oclock in the morning.And she brings her weird friends over all the time.They dont like me.She told me Im too uptight.And then I come home, and I dont even fit in here anymore.Dont fit in here?Of course you fit in here.Where?Shes in my bedroom!Oh, hell.What was he supposed to say to that?I hate college, Angela muttered.Marcs heart skipped with apprehension.You have to give it time.Ive given it time.A couple of weeks isnt enough.She sighed, her eyes glistening with tears.Dont worry.Its not like Im going to drop out or anything.He started to say, Well, I sure as hell hope not!Fortunately, he managed to keep that comment to himself.I needed a break, Angela went on.I thought if I just came home for the weekend  Her voice trailed off, and Marc felt like shit.Its always been just you and me, you know?she said.And then I came through the door and there was this other person She nodded toward the house.Is it serious?He started to say of course it wasnt serious.He didnt know Kari well enough for it to be serious.But what kind of example was that to set?He was having sex with a woman, but it wasnt serious?We havent been seeing each other very long, he said finally.Are you going to keep seeing her?Marc felt as if he was treading through a minefield.Yeah.I think I am.Angela turned away, and he could tell that wasnt the answer she wanted.Why is she in my room?He told her about the guy whod been trespassing outside the cottage and that was what had led him to move Kari to the house.But it didnt seem to make her any happier.She let out a shaky sigh.What?he said.She shrugged weakly.When I was at school, I got to thinking about harvest, and that afterward Tears filled her eyes again.When I come home, you wont be here anymore.I wont be gone forever, he told her.Ill be back home to visit.We can just make sure were home at the same time.Not if I come home every weekend.You might be in another state or something.You said you thought it was cool that I was going to travel.I know, she said.But now that Im thinking about you actually doing it  No!Whether he was in Rainbow Valley or halfway across the country, it wasnt supposed to matter.She was supposed to be thrilled with college.Meeting other kids.Finding a boyfriend.Enjoying the experience.It made him miserable to think that she was miserable, but he had no idea what to do about it.If you dont want me in the cottage, Angela said, then I guess theres nowhere for me to stay.I can move Karis stuff to my room, Marc said.Oh, God.Angela squeezed her eyes closed and dropped her head to her hands.No.Please, no.Thats so weird.Marc thought about putting Kari up for a couple of nights at Animal House, but that really wasnt a solution to the problem.Maybe this time there just wasnt one.Angela looked up again, sniffing a little.Its okay.Ill just go back to school.Angela  No, really.Its all right.Ill go back.I need to face my problems, right?Isnt that what youve always said?Im just going to go back.Ill talk to Kim.Itll be fine.She grabbed her purse and stood up.Marc hated this.Hated it.Are you okay?he asked.Of course I am.I have to go.Without another word, she turned and trotted down the porch steps to circle the house rather than going back through the kitchen.Will you call me when you get back to Austin?he called out.Ill text.And then she was gone.He went back inside to find Kari sitting at the kitchen table.Wheres Angela?she asked.She went back to school.Marc collapsed in a chair beside Kari.God, Marc.Im so sorry.It wasnt your fault.Yeah, it kinda was.Youre not a sex on the kitchen table kind of guy.Marc sighed.First Daniel, now Angela.From now on, when we get naked, maybe wed better keep it behind closed doors.Kari nodded.I guess Angela doesnt like the idea of her father having a sex life.Then again, I cant imagine any kid who wants to spend much time thinking about that.Marc exhaled, his eyes drifting closed.Youre having a really hard time with this, arent you?she asked.He was silent.It makes you feel guilty, she said.Yeah.I guess it does.So how did she feel about the relationships you had with women when she was growing up?There werent any.Kari drew back.Are you telling me its been eighteen years since you had sex?No!Good God, no.Its not as if there havent been women.But every time I dated a woman in Rainbow Valley, the gossip went wild.I hated that.Everybody knows everybody elses business around here.And then Angela got older, to an age where whatever women I saw affected her, too.And then I got so busy with the vineyard, and years passed, and suddenlyhere I am.So you havent had any real relationships?Marc realized just how pathetic that sounded.No.I was always afraid of it causing a problem.And now it has?Marc didnt know what to say to that.Yeah, it was a problem, but at what point was he supposed to stop worrying about how his daughter might feel about his personal life and start living that personal life?Marc, I want you to listen to me, Kari said.If Im causing a problem between you and your daughter, Im out of here.All you have to do is say the word.Im serious.What we have is just fun and games, right?That was our deal.But you and your daughterthats forever.Yes.Fun and games.Wasnt that what theyd agreed on?But when he thought about Kari leaving, he had the oddest sensation that it would open up a hole inside him hed never be able to fill again.Being with her was like having a window into the life hed put on hold all these years, and the last thing he wanted to do was let her go.I want you to stay, he told her.Angela is just going to have to deal with it.When he dropped his head with a sigh, she squeezed his hand.Youre still having a problem with this.Im just worried about her.She says she doesnt like school.Thats why she came home.Dont a lot of freshmen get homesick?So I hear.I just never imagined shed be one of those kids.She says she had a fight with her roommate.Shell work it out.Maybe.But if she cant concentrate on her classes  Did she do well in high school?Valedictorian.Did you raise her right?Of course I did.Then you have nothing to worry about.A smart girl who was raised right is going to be just fine in the end no matter what happens in the middle.So you dont need to worry.She told me shes not going to drop out.Well, thats good, right?I dont like it that she even said the words.At her age, kids can change from day to day, Kari said.Hour to hour sometimes.I know its pointless to tell you not to worry because thats what you do, but things really are going to work themselves out.She leaned in and gave him a kiss.Just the touch of her lips and the feel of her palm against his cheek calmed his nerves and cleared his mind.When she pulled away and smiled at him, he ducked his head and kissed her again, losing himself in the feeling, and soon he found himself believing every word she said.Maybe everything really was going to be all right.The next day at Rosies, Kari went out of her way to keep her momentum going, to let loose on the job, have fun, be charming, and play with the kids.Bobbie sidled up to the men, practically doing pole dances without the pole.As they compared tips at the end of the day, Kari just about jumped for joy.She came out five bucks ahead of Bobbie.Bobbie looked horrified.Thats impossible!Oh, no, Kari said.Do you think I counted wrong?What I think is that you told Marla to give you all the kids.Of course you get all the tips.Thats not fair.Youve never wanted the kids, Gloria said.I do if thats where the money is!Youve never made much money on tables with kids before.Whats going to change now?Bobbie looked a little bewildered at that, her brows drawing together angrily.Youre right.The last thing I want is all the snot nosed brats.She glared at Kari.Game on.The day after that Kari hit the ground running, smiling at everyone and making certain all her customers had a good time.She made a fuss over the babies, which wasnt hard to do because she loved babies.She ran to take photos if tourists wanted them.Even during the busiest shift, she found she had plenty of time once she got into a rhythm.If she goofed and it delayed somebody getting their lunch, she gave the customer a good natured apology and moved her tail to correct the error.And through it all, she kept a smile on her face.Unfortunately, camera guy showed up again and started asking her a ton of questions.Since he wasnt movie star hot, Bobbie didnt horn in, even though this time Kari wished she would.I think he likes you, Gloria said, and when his questions got increasingly personal, Kari was starting to think she was right.She excused herself as quickly as she could in case he was working up the nerve to ask her out.She breathed a sigh of relief when he finally asked for his check and left.As the lunch rush wound down but there were still plenty of customers in the restaurant, Kari had a crazy thought and ran with it.She asked a couple of kids if they could balance a spoon on their noses, then proceeded to do it herself.She held her head very still, rested the bowl of the spoon against her nose, and when it looked as if it was going to stay, she held her arms out with a flourish.The kids clapped, which led everybody else in the place to turn around and look.Kari turned slowly, showing off the spoon as it dangled from her nose, and pretty soon people were asking for spoons so they could try it.As they did, Kari took a few orders and delivered a few lunches.Bobbie rolled her eyes and told her how stupid it was, but there was nothing stupid about the attention Kari got from the customers.At the end of their shift, when Kari innocently reported seven dollars more in tips than Bobbie, Gloria said, Gee, Bobbie.Maybe the last few days werent flukes after all.Bobbie opened her mouth, ready to object, but Kari jumped in.No!Of course they were flukes!I got one really big tip today from a guy who drove his family here in a Mercedes SUV.I mean, how often do we see one of those around here?Exactly, Bobbie said.It didnt have anything to do with the spoon thing, Kari said.That was kind of silly.Of course it was silly.I mean, really.After all, Bobbies been at this much longer than I have.I can only hope someday Ill be as good as she is.Bobbies mouth moved, but no sound came out.Her face turned a funny shade of red, as if she was burning on the inside and the flames were trying to make their way out.Finally she just gathered up her money and walked away.Oh, my God!Gloria said, her eyes wide.That was the most beautiful thing Ive ever seen.I thought the top of her head was going to blow off!Over the next several days, Kari still had fun with the families, and Bobbie continued to all but disrobe in front of the men.But for some reason, Bobbie didnt seem inclined to compare tips at the end of the day, and the snide remarks seemed to fall by the wayside.Kari didnt care if Bobbie liked her or not, because shed learned that liking was one thing, but respecting was another.This meant Kari could make money.Never much money at a job like this, but enough to keep body and soul together without somebody else telling her what to do with her life.She never could have imagined a job like this one in a tiny little town could make her feel so free.One evening she had the late shift, and she and Rosie were the last ones out the door.As Rosie drove away, Kari got into the Bomb.She stuck the key into the ignition.Turned it.Pumped the gas pedal.It made the same horrible grinding noise it always did, but this time it didnt start.She stopped.Backed off.Waited a few seconds and tried again.Still a lot of grinding, but the engine wouldnt turn over.She looked back at the caf, but Rosie was already gone, and the place was dark.Unfortunately, all the other shops on the square were probably closed, too.Nina.If she hurried, she might be able to go to the wineshop and catch her before she left.With luck, shed have jumper cables.Kari started to get out of the car, only to see a man standing along a brick wall near an alley between two of the shops.It was dark, and at first she didnt recognize him.Then she realized it was camera guy.He just stood nonchalantly by the wall smoking a cigarette, paying no attention to her.Then slowly he turned and looked over his shoulder.At this distance, she couldnt tell if he was looking at her or not, but she still felt a quiver of apprehension.Now that she thought about it, how many amateur photographers his age hung around a small town like this one for weeks on end?Whenever he came into Rosies, he was full of questions for her.Personal questions.Shed written him off as a guy who was probably interested in asking her out but didnt have the guts to do it.Now she wasnt so sure.Instead of getting out of the car, she locked the door, grabbed her phone, and called Marc.After three rings, he picked up.I have a problem, she said.Problem?What problem?The Bomb wont start.Crap.Are you sure theres gas in it?Yes.Then it needs a jump.Hope its just the battery and not the alternator.Ill be there in a few minutes.Marc, theres something else.What?Theres a guy whos been in the caf a few times.He always asks to sit in my section.He asks a lot of personal questions.Now that I think about it, Ive seen him quite a few times over the past few weeks.He told me hes just an amateur photographer, but Im getting a bad feeling about him.What kind of bad feeling?Like hes watching me.Then we need to talk to the sheriff.The guy is here right now.What?Hes standing in that alley between the bookstore and the art gallery.I think hes watching me.Its probably nothing, but  No.Its not nothing.Go back inside the caf.Its closed.Locked up.Who else is still in the parking lot?Nobody.Its just me.Are you inside the car?Yes.Lock the doors.I did.But Nina might still be at the shop.Maybe I could  No!Dont get out of the car!Ill be there as soon as I can, but Im also calling the sheriff.The guys not doing anything wrong.What can the sheriff do?Just stay put until you see either me or the sheriff.Do you hear me?I hear you.Just then the guy looked over his shoulder again, and Karis apprehension turned into full blown anxiety.Marc?Yeah?Hurry.14    Marc leaped into his truck and hit the highway, trying to call the sheriff along the way.When he finally got in touch with him, he was working a traffic accident five miles out of town and couldnt respond.As Marc entered the city limits, he called Kari back to tell her he was almost there.She said the guy was still in the alley and he was still watching her.Instead of pulling into the parking lot where Kari was, Marc parked his truck on the street behind the square three doors down from Rosies and got out, walking quietly to where Kari said the man was standing.When Marc came around the corner of the alley, the guy jumped with surprise.Marc grabbed him by the collar, spun him around, and shoved him against the wall.The guys eyes flew wide open with surprise, and then his expression settled into an angry snarl.Who are you?Marc said.And why are you following Kari?Get your fucking hands off me!Marc had four inches in height and fifty pounds on the guy, so he saw no reason to comply with that particular request.I asked you a question.Youve been following Kari.Why?Its not a crime to watch a woman.But trespassing on my property is a crime.When the guy swallowed hard and didnt respond, Marc knew hed found his trespasser.Lets see some ID, Marc said.I dont have to show you shit.Would you rather show the sheriff?Im not doing anything wrong.There are stalker laws.Im not a stalker!Prove it.Marc released the guy, and he took out his wallet and produced a business card.Marc blinked with surprise.Youre a private investigator?Thats right.Who are you working for?Once again, the guy refused to answer.I asked you who youre working for, Marc said, with a heaping dose of malice in his voice.I dont have to tell you a damned thing.Then all at once it came together for Marc, and he knew what the guy wasnt telling him.And the very thought of it made his blood boil.
