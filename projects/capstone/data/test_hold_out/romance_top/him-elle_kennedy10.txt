My team for this year is the Storm Sharks U18.Heres the link, just in case you were ever curious about my stats.I think theyre about to improve, and its all because of you.Sincerely,  John Killfeather, Jr.I read the email twice.And then I read it one more time.It doesnt say a thing about Wes and me, and there arent any slurs.Just a kid who wants to play hockey, and knows enough to say thank you to the people whove tried to help him.Damn, Im proud of this email.And I feel just a little more optimistic about life than I did five minutes ago.I tap out a quick response, because I sure dont want to forget.Killfeatheryou are an amazing goalie and it was my pleasure to work with you this summer.Of course Ill check out your stats as the winter progresses.Youre going to rock this season.Sincerely, Jamie Canning        Then I go back to pacing and worrying about Wes.What if they show him the door, and Im not even there for him?And where in Lake Placid can I get a blood test, like, tomorrow?When my phone rings, I jump about a foot, then hurriedly swipe to answer.Hey babe!You okay?What happened?Yeah, Im okay.His husky voice slides into my ear and wraps around my heart.I can hear that hes out on the street somewhere, and I wonder what hell be able to tell me.Damn, I wish you were here right now, he says.I brace myself.Id take you out to this Italian restaurant on Queen Street that the guys love.Im starving and I want to tell you every word of the trippy conversation I just had.Im practically dizzy with stress right now.What kind of conversation?The good kind, he assures me.My heart rate drops one notch, but Im still afraid to be hopeful.Because it seems impossible to believe a high profile NHL team would shrug off Wess confession.None of this computes.But wouldnt we avoid the places where your team likes to eat?I ask slowly.You know that means people will see us, right?Yeah, but some day soon thats not going to matter.Really?I want a guarantee.I want a notarized document.I want a Valium.Or a blowjob.Or both.Im having a really good day, Wes whispers.My blood pressure drops again.Im glad, I whisper back.I love you, he adds.I know.Wes laughs in my ear, and the happy sound of it is what convinces me we might be okay.40      Jamie      On a Friday in mid August I move in to our apartment.Though moving in requires air quotes, because we dont own much of anything.Earlier in the week Wes ordered a coucha macho leather thing, if Ive understood the description correctly.It seems his taste runs to early man cave, and I cant say I mind.He also picked up three bar stools for the kitchen island, which means we can put off worrying about an actual table.Last night, after round one of our I missed you so much sexual marathon, Wes made a show of going to the grocery store, but he only came back with chips, dip and beer, which means I need to go back again and buy actual food.I may not have mentioned to him yet that Im a pretty good cook.Wes seems prepared to survive on take out, and in Toronto thats easily done.Im going to have to acquire some pots and pans and blow his mind one of these days.That sounds like a whole lot of fun, actually.Meanwhile, we blew each others minds (and other parts) in our new bedroom last night.Then we passed out and slept for nine hours in our brand new king sized bed.Now its Saturday, and theres still plenty to do.This morning, after breakfast at a diner, I drag Wes around Toronto for a few more necessary items.By the time we finally get home, Wes is in a state of agitation.Im pretty sure Im going to have to calm him down with a blowjob.Thats three hours of my life Im never getting back, he fusses as we walk in.His words echo, because our apartment is still awfully bare.The reason for Wess bad mood is the fact that shopping took three hours, because were just a couple of jocks who dont know one store from another.We went into four stores before we found one that didnt look like the Queen of England was planning a visit.Thats where we picked out a rug and coffee table, which we bought.But the place didnt stock coffee makers, so we had to keep shopping.Good coffee is non negotiable, I told him while he grumbled.But after I chose a dual drip/espresso machine with an integrated grinder, I started checking out the towels.Thats when Wes lost it a little bit, and I gave up and brought him home.Oh, the irony, he moans, kicking off his shoes.My boyfriend dragged me to a fucking mall.Youre right, I say drolly.That trip was entirely gratuitous.Who needs towels?We can just air dry.Grumpy Wes stomps into the bedroom and I follow him, because its one of two functional rooms in our place.I set down the coffee maker and watch while he throws off his shirt and climbs onto our giant bed.Would you please get over here?he whines.Its an emergency.Its a good thing youre so attractive, I mutter as I ditch my shoes.I had no idea that stepping into a store turned you into cryin Ryan.I walk over to the bed where a shirtless, ripped man lies waiting for me, his expression burning up with lust.It doesnt usually, he mumbles.But we have a situation.He grabs my hand and tugs.I climb onto his body, leaning down to tongue his nipple, and he moans.What kind of situation?I ask between licks.He lets out a shaky breath.I thought it would be fun to wear a plug out to breakfast today.That way you could fuck me when we got home  My eyes snap up to his.Seriously?He nods, his expression miserable.But then you said, Lets just look at a couple of rugs.And that was, like, hours ago.Every time I walk across another store, this thing massages my prostate.If you dont fuck me in the next five minutes Im going to explode.Im speechless.But my dick has plenty to say.Im already hard at the idea of Wes being prepped and ready for me.I drop my mouth onto his and he moans again.My tongue glides across his piercing and were off to the horny dog races.We kiss as if theres a meteor heading straight for the Toronto metropolitan area.Wess eager hands roam my ass while I suck on his tongue.His eagerness is like a drug, and I want hit after hit.I can feel how hard he is, even through all of our clothes.He wants me to fuck him, and hes all primed and ready?Mmm, I moan into his mouth.Sexiest fucking thing I ever heard.Thats when the doorbell rings.Hold that thought, I say, pushing up on one arm.Nooooo!Wes lifts both his legs to trap me in them.No.Kiss.No.Kiss.Dont even think about it.Pinning his hands to the quilt is easy, because hes horny to the point of distraction.Stop it, baby.Its the couch delivery.Were paying seventy five bucks for them to show up on a Saturday.I hate you, he says, but he releases me.I can tell, I argue, squeezing his hard dick as I climb off him.He moans one more time, cursing me, the sofa and also the universe.I close the bedroom door for Wess privacy and for my own sanity.I use the intercom to buzz down to the front desk, and I ask the doorman to send the sofa up on the freight elevator.Then I adjust myself and try to think about boring stuff to deflate the tent Im pitching in my shorts.But there is no boring stuff.I start my job next week, and I cant freaking wait.Meanwhile, I get to explore this gorgeous city where Im living with the man whose company Ive craved since I was thirteen.And moving in together isnt even scary.If you tally up all the weeks wed spent at camp over the years, weve actually lived together for more than a year already.Theres a whole lot of sex involved now, of course.Everything is different, and yet its exactly the same.And its a whole lot of fun.When I let the delivery guys in, there are three of them.Where do you want it?they ask.Anywhere over here, I indicate the living room.Were going to have to move it when our rug comes, so it doesnt matter where.Nice place, the man in charge remarks, cracking his gum.His guys set the sofa in the middle of the space.Its wrapped in a lot of plastic, so I hope its the one Wes ordered.Thanks.I sign for the sofa.After they troop out, I close and lock the door, then walk over to the sofa and run a hand along the length of it.Hey, Wesley!I call loud enough for him to hear me behind the bedroom door.Getcha ass out here!No!he counters.I tug my shirt off.Then I drop my shorts.Im naked!That does it.He throws open the bedroom door and speed walks down the hallway, nude, carrying a bottle of lube.By the time he reaches me, Im sitting spread eagled on the back of the sofa like a porn star, stroking myself.Wes spares the couch a single glance.Dude, my couch is wearing a condom.I grab his hips and pull him close to me.I noticed that, I say, kissing his jaw.Thats because it knows Im about to bend you over it.Wes groans.Promises, promises.He slips a hand between our bodies and cups it over my hand.We stroke each other while our kisses grow deeper and hotter.I reach around his body and cup his ass.When my hand finds the toy lodged there, I groan into his mouth.Do it, he pants.Everything begins to happen very fast.With a firm grasp, I remove the toy, while Wes slicks up my dick.He yanks me off the sofas back and braces himself against it.Go, he orders.I come up behind him and grip his hips, the head of my cock sliding between his taut ass cheeks.Just like the other night, Im floored by the sensation of being skin to skin.Theres no barrier between my throbbing dick and his tight ass, and when I drive deep on the first stroke, we both groan with abandon.Fuck me, he demands when I go still.But Im too busy savoring the incredible feeling of being inside him without a condom.I roll my hips and he growls like a grumpy bear.I swear to God, Canning, if you dont move, Im gonna  I pull out, then slam right back in.He makes a choked sound, his entire body trembling.Youre gonna what?I ask mockingly.Rather than answer, he just moans again.Low, agonized.Shit, hes desperate for it.I guess I would be too if Id walked around all day with a plug rubbing on my prostate.I smooth my hand down his strong back, then lean in and plant a kiss between his shoulder blades as I withdraw again.I like you like this, I murmur.That sexy ass in the air.Having you at my mercy.Hearing you beg.He blows out a breath.Youre a sadist.Laughing, I quicken the pace.Three, four frantic thrusts before I slow down again, which draws a strangled groan from his lips.You need to learn some patience, I tell him.But shit, Im teasing myself as much as Im teasing him.My balls are so tight they hurt, already tingling with the telltale signs of impending release.Screw patience, he grumbles.Wanna come.Sulking aint helping your cause, dude.No?How about this then?He pushes his ass back against me and starts fucking my cock, fast and greedy.Holy hell.Theres no way I can hold back now.Its too good.Im too horny.My fingers dig into his hips as I slam into him, each deep thrust sending me closer and closer to the edge.Our breathing grows labored as our bodies slap together, but I need more.I need I plant my hands on his chest and tug him up so his back is plastered to me.The new angle makes him cry out in pleasure, and then he twists his head toward me and our lips meet in a scorching kiss that fogs my brain.Were joined in every way possible.My cock inside him, our tongues fused together, his powerful body straining against mine.I reach around him and grip his erection, slowing the movement of my hips.I jerk him in long, lazy strokes that match the languid thrusts of my cock.I dont come until you do, I whisper.Then I slip my tongue in his mouth and suck on his tongue ring, and thats all it takes for him to shoot all over my hand.Wes gasps for air.His ass ripples around my cock, squeezing me so hard it triggers an orgasm I feel in the tips of my fingers and the soles of my feet.I give in to it, my arms wrapped around my boyfriends strong chest as I come inside him.Were both unsteady on our feet, so I pull out and tug him onto the couch.He collapses beside me, his dark hair tickling my chin as we lie there recovering from yet another round of spectacular sex.I dont think Ill ever get used to how good the sex is.Wes suddenly laughs.Thank God for the couch condom.Wha I grin when I realize what he means.The bareback thing is kinda messy, huh?Messys fun.His breath heats my shoulder.But once the plastic comes off, we should probably lay down a towel or something if were going to fuck on this couch.If?The way we go at it, there wont be a single surface in this apartment we havent fucked on.He chuckles again, then releases a contented sigh and nestles even closer.As it happens, snuggling on a plastic wrapped couch is not that comfortable.So we have a quick shower together, then lie down on the bed.Were wet, of course, and our hair is dripping.Im beginning to see your point about towels, Wes says as I kiss a drop of water off his shoulder.Now he gets it, I sigh, and then hunt for more drops on his taut skin.I lick the barbell in his eyebrow, and the slightly metallic taste makes me shiver.I love having my own personal bad boy in bed with me.Wes strokes a lazy hand up and down my back, and its divine.We need towels, and a plug for you.So you can walk a mile in my horny shoes.That was so hot, though, I concede.Damn.He runs a hand through my wet hair.Glad you liked it.I wanted to make it easier for you.What?Theres something serious in his tone, so I stop kissing him everywhere to look him in the eye.Easier?But he looks away.You know.Easier.When you were with women, it didnt take them half a fucking hour to prepare for sex.A chuckle rises in my throat, but I choke it back because his expression is so serious.How many women have you fucked, Wes?Sheepish, he holds up one finger.Im startled for a second, until I remember the summer we were sixteen, when Wes had shown up at camp and admitted to losing his virginity.Getting the dirty details out of him, however, had been like pulling teeth.Now I know why.Right, one.And you were both too inexperienced to know what you were doing.I shrug.Plenty of women need a lot of warm up time.So I have to call a technical foul here just on rules alone.But alsothats just not the point.We have a lot of quick and dirty times.Thats what blowjobs are for.He gives me a weak grin.Sure.But  But what?Well, Ill never be able give you everything you like.Ah.Dude, stop.Im not pining for pussy.That sounded much funnier coming out of my mouth than Id expected it to, so we both laugh.Im serious, though.I enjoyed women, but I was never in love with one.Every time I say it, it seems more obvious.And every time I say it, Wess face goes soft.Can you promise me you wont worry about this?Because theres no way I can prove it to you, except by having lots of sex with you.That works.His cocky smile is back, and Im happy to see it.Good.I roll over and fit myself against him.In a little while I have to check my Facebook page.Why?My stomach tightens just thinking about it.Tomorrow is Sunday dinner, right?So I outed myself to them today.On Facebook?he yelps.I reach back and give his ass a pinch.Give me a little credit?My family has a private group.Its just the kids, their spouses and my parents.I didnt even tell them your last name.He goes very quiet behind me, but his hand traces lazy circles on my back.Are you worried?he finally asks.Thats a fair question.Not really.They wont freak about the fact that youre a dude.But they might be like, Why didnt you tell us?Is this why you quit the NHL?And why did you leave the country?I dont like to be grilled.When did you post it?This morning before we went out for breakfast.So, like, five hours ago.Its one oclock in Cali right now.Theyve probably seen it.Go get your phone, he whispers.41      Wes      I wait on the bed by myself saying an unlikely prayer for Jamie.He is quite possibly the most laidback person Ive ever met.I love that about him.But it makes him vulnerable.People can be assholes about smaller stuff than their brother having a gay relationship.If anyone has said something ugly to Jamie on that Facebook page, Ill probably punch something.He doesnt come back, though.And then I hear a groan from the living room.That gets me on my feet and running through the apartment.I find Jamie perched on the edge of the condom couch, his face in his hands.My stomach lurches.I dont want this for Jamie.Its taken me four years to get over my parents reaction to my coming out.Hell, Im probably still not over it.He holds out his phone to me, and I take it with a shaking hand.His Facebook post is pure Jamie:  Hi all.I feel like a heel doing this over Facebook, but I cant reach everyone by tomorrow.Youre all going to discuss me on Sunday, anyway.And in case you think my account was hacked, it wasnt.As proof Ill confess that Im the one who broke Moms Christmas tree angel when I was seven.It was death by baseball, but I swear she didnt suffer.Anyway, I have to catch you up on a few developments.Ive taken the coaching job in Toronto, and Ive declined my spot in Detroit.This feels like the right career move, but theres something else.Im living with my boyfriend (that was not a typo. )His name is Wes, and we met at Lake Placid about nine years ago.In case you were lacking something to talk about over dinner, Ive fixed that problem.Love you all.Jamie        Beneath the post theres a selfie that we took yesterday.Were in our new kitchen, and the groceries Id just bought are strewn around.Jamie was teasing me about my shopping habits, and I was giving him shit about something.I dont even remember what.But wed leaned our heads together, and Im making the sign of the devil.And we just look so fucking happy, I practically dont even recognize myself.I scroll down to the comments, and my stomach rolls over in dread.Joe: OMG.Jamester, really?You did not just confess to dating a Patriots fan.That is a sin, little brother.I fear for your everlasting soul.I squint at the picture and sure enough Im wearing my Super Bowl 2015 Victory shirt.Whoops.Tammy: Joe, you asshole!Dont listen to him, Jamie.Your boyfriend is hot.And Jess owes me twenty bucks.Brady: Im going to have to side with Joe on this one.What if football comes up at Thanksgiving?If your boyfriend wants to talk about balls, its going to be awkward!Joe: *High fives Brady*  Jess: I do not owe you twenty bucks!You said he was moping about a GIRL.Tammy: I said a relationship.Jess: *cough* *bullshit*  Mrs.Canning: Jess, language!Jamie honey, when are you bringing your boyfriend home for Sunday dinner?And are those Doritos in the background?Is there Whole Foods in Canada?Im going to look on their website and send you the address.Mrs.Canning: And thank you for telling me about the angel.I knew it was you, though, sweetie.Youve never been good at deception.Scotty: Jamie, Dad cant remember his Facebook password.But he says to tell you he loves you no matter what and blah blah blah.Thats when I snort, and Jamie looks up.Theyre pretty ridiculous, right?I think theyre I have to swallow hard, because Im so happy for him.I think theyre great.He shrugs.I spent my whole life trying to stand out from the crowd.I swear to God, I could announce I wanted to live my life as a transsexual vampire yeti, and theyd still say Oh, Jamie.Youre so cute.Its a challenge for me to swallow again, but this time because of the massive lump obstructing my throat.As always, Jamie senses my distress.This man knows me, inside and out.He always has.Whats wrong?Nothings wrong.Its just I speak past the lump.Youre really lucky, Canning.Your family loves you.I mean, they really, truly love you, and not just because youre related by blood and they have to love you.His brown eyes soften.I know hes thinking about my family, but I dont give him the chance to make excuses for my folks.My mother is a trophy wife, I say roughly.And Im a trophy son.Neither one of my parents ever saw me as anything more than that, and they never will.Itsucks.Jamie tugs me toward him.Yeah, it sucks, he agrees.But heres the thing about family, Ryanblood doesnt mean shit.You just need to surround yourself with people who do love you, and they become your family.I sink down on the couch beside him, the plastic crinkling beneath my boxers.He slings one muscular arm around me, then brushes his lips over my temple.Im your family, babe.He takes the phone from my hand and taps the screen.And these crazy maniacs?Theyll be your family too if you let them.I mean, theyll fucking drive you bananas sometimes, but trust me when I say its totally worth it.I believe him.I cant wait to meet them, I say softly.His mouth travels along the edge of my jaw before hovering over my lips.Theyre going to love you.He kisses me, slow and sweet.I love you.I rub the pad of my thumb over his bottom lip.Loved you every summer since I was thirteen years old.Love you even more now.Our lips are millimeters from meeting again when he says, I need to know something, and you have to promise to be honest.Im always honest with you, I protest.Good.Im holding you to that.Those gorgeous brown eyes gleam.Did you throw the shootout?I know exactly which shootout hes referring to.My lips quiver, so I press them together to keep from grinning.Well?I shrug.Wesley Theres a warning note in his voice now.Tell me what happened during that shootout.Well.I hesitate.I really dont know.I was terrified to win, because I knew Id have to let you off the hook.And I was terrified of losing, because I wanted to touch you so bad, and I was afraid youd figure that out.His face is full of sympathy, but I dont need it anymore.Its water under the bridge now.I lean closer and kiss him on the nose.So, those last two shots?I hardly remember what happened.I was allJesus, take the wheel!Jamie laughs at me.And then he kisses me.I lock my hands at the nape of his neck and tug him closer.Warm skin slides against mine, and I know Im home.Because home is with him.Epilogue      Wes    Thanksgiving   Ryan Theodore Wesley!Put that knife down this instant!I freeze like an ice sculpture as Jamies mother barrels toward me, one hand planted on her hip, the other pointing to the chefs knife in my hand.Who taught you how to chop onions?she demands.I glance down at the cutting board in front of me.As far as I can tell, I havent committed any major onion related crimes.Um I meet Cindy Cannings eyes.Well, thats kind of a trick question.Nobody taught me, per se.My parents have a cook that comes in four times a week to prepare meals andwait, Im sorry, did you call me Ryan Theodore?She waves her hand as if the question is inconsequential.I dont know your middle name so I had to make one up.Because, sweetie, you really needed to be middle named for mangling those poor onions.I cant stop the laugh that flies out of my mouth.Jamies mother is so fucking awesome.Im far more relaxed in her kitchen than I expected to be.Jamie and I arrived in California two days ago, but since I had a game the first night, Jamie went to his folks place while I stayed at the hotel with my teammates.After the team crushed San Jose, I did the usual post game press, and then yesterday morning I drove up to San Rafael to join Jamie and his family.The big holiday meal today will be the real test of their acceptance.Ive already met Jamies mom and dad and one brother.So far, so good.These need to be chopped into smaller pieces, Cindy tells me.She smacks my butt to move me aside, then takes my place.Have a seat at the counter.You can watch while I chop.Take notes if you need to.I grin at her.So I guess Jamie didnt tell you how much I suck at cooking, huh?He most certainly did not.She fixes me with a stern look.But youll have to learn, because I cant spend all my time worrying that my baby boy isnt being fed over there in Siberia.Toronto, I correct with a snort.And Im sure you can guess hes the one whos been feeding me.Now that the hockey season is underway, life is hectic as fuck.Practice is brutal, and our schedule is exhausting.Jamies my rock, though.He comes to all my home games, and when I drag my tired self home from the airport after an away game, hes waiting there to rub my shoulders, or shove food down my throat, or screw me until I cant see straight.Our apartment is my safe place, my haven.I cant even believe I considered trying to make it through my rookie season without him.Its easy to figure out where he got that nurturing gene from, because his mom has been fussing over me all day.Another snort sounds from the doorway, and then Jamies father strides into the kitchen.Toronto, he echoes.What kind of city doesnt have a football team?Explain that to me, Wes.They do have one, I point out.The Argonauts.Richard narrows his eyes.Is it an NFL team?Well, no, its CFL, but  Then they dont have a team, he says firmly.I stifle a laugh.Jamie warned me that his family was football fanatics, but I genuinely thought he was exaggerating.Wheres Jamie?Richard glances around the kitchen as if he expects Jamie to pop out of a cupboard.He went to pick up Jess, Cindy tells her husband.She wants to have a few drinks tonight so shes leaving her car at home.Richard nods in approval.Good girl, he says, as if Jess can somehow hear him all the way across town.I have to admit I was terrified to meet Jamies family.I mean, I already know theyre good people.But a father and three older brothers?I had this nagging fear theyd hate me just on principle.You know, for being the guy whos fucking their baby boy.But Jamies dad has been great, and Ive already met Scott, whos staying here at the house.The three of us went out for beers at a sports bar last night, and when the highlights from the previous nights games played on the TV screens, Scott had clapped his hands against the table and shouted, Thats my brother!every time I skated into view.And when the goal I scored late in the second flashed on the screen?Jamie and Scott went nuts.Yup, my first ever NHL goal.Im still fucking ecstatic about it.This past month, Ive been seeing more and more playing time, and last night was a record for metwelve minutes of ice time, and a goal for my efforts.Life is good.So good, in fact, Im feeling more generous than usual, which is why I slide off my stool and say, Will you excuse me for a moment?I need to call my folks to wish them a happy Thanksgiving.Jamies mother beams at me.Aw, thats so sweet of you.Go ahead.I duck out and fish my phone out of my pocket.Fuck, Im even smiling as I dial my parents number in Boston.The smile fades fast, however.It always does when I hear my fathers voice.Hey, Dad, I say gruffly.Is this a good time?Actually, it isnt.Your mother and I are on our way out.We have reservations at six.Of course they do.The only time my family held a Thanksgiving dinner at home was the year the president of my dads brokerage firm was going through a divorce.The guy had nowhere to go, so he invited himself over to our place, and my mother hired a gourmet caterer to cook a fucking banquet for us.What did you want, Ryan?he asks briskly.Ijust wanted to say Happy Thanksgiving, I mumble.Oh.Well, thank you.Same to you, son.He disconnects the call.Without even putting my mother on the line.Then again, he speaks for both of them.I stare at the phone long after he hangs up, wondering what I did in another life to lose so royally in the parent lottery.But the depressing thought doesnt have time to take root, because the front door suddenly flies open and Im assaulted with noise.Footsteps.Voices.Loud laughter and happy squeals.It sounds like an entire platoon has marched into the house.Which is pretty much the case, because holy shit, Jamies family is huge.I feel an unfamiliar surge of nerves in my chest.Within seconds, Im surrounded, being yanked in all directions and hugged by people Ive never met in my life.Introductions fly around, but I can barely keep up with the names.Im too busy answering all the questions being hurled my way like slapshots.Did Jamester give you a tour of the house?Yes.Has Mom shown you the pictures from the Halloween when Jamie dressed up as an eggplant?No, but that should be corrected immediately.Do you get a monetary bonus every time you score a goal?Um...Are you in love with my brother?Tammy!Jamie sputters as his older sister voices that last question.I look up and find him in the mob, and its like the sun just came out.Its only been an hour since I saw him last, but he has the same damn effect on me every time.I used to fight my reaction to him, but I dont have to anymore.And thats more shocking than the way his family seems ready to embrace the complete stranger whos shacking up with their brother.Unless theyre just really good actors.Jamie slips between his siblings and slings his arm around my shoulder.Leave the poor guy alone, will ya?He just got here yesterday.His brother Joe snorts.You think were gonna go easy on him because hes only been here a day?Have you met us?Jess wiggles her way between me and Jamie and links her arm through mine.Come on, Wes, lets get you a drink.I find its easier to tolerate these dum dums when youre drunk.I snicker as she drags me toward the dining room, but Jamies mom calls out from the kitchen just as we pass by.Jessica, I need Wes!Jamie, too.You can raid the liquor cabinet later.I wasnt going to raid the Jess stops abruptly and turns to me, heaving a defeated sigh.I swear that woman is a mind reader.I find myself being ushered into the kitchen again, except this time Jamie is by my side.As his mom gestures for us to wait, he brings his mouth close to my ear and says, Are we having fun yet?Yes, I say truthfully.Because fuck, the Canning clan has been great.Maybe I can stop worrying so much.Maybe theres one corner of the world where I dont have to prove myself all the time.Okaytwo corners.Because life in a certain Toronto condo is going really well, too.Okay, boys, heres your housewarming present.I look up to see Jamies mom setting two gift boxes on the counter.One says Jamie on the tag and the other Ryan.Aw, Jamie says.You didnt have to do that.My last bird has flown out of the nest.Cindy sighs.If I cant see your apartment, at least I can give you a little something for it.You can see it, I hear myself volunteer.Come visit.Jamie and I lock eyes then, and theres humor in his.Maybe hes thinking the same thing I amif his mom visits, well have to hide all the sex toys in the bathroom cabinet.Ill do that!she says cheerily.Now open them!The siblings crowd us as Jamie and I each open a box.I lift the lid and push some tissue paper aside.Then I pull out a gorgeous hand thrown coffee mug.It says HIS on the side.I hear laughter and look over at Jamies gift.Another mug reading HIS.Mom!Jess hollers.The point of labeled mugs is so that they can tell them apart!You should have done their initials.But that wouldnt amuse me, his mother explains, grinning.Thanks, I chuckle while my boyfriend laughs.I turn the mug over in my hands, imagining Cindy making this for me in her pottery studio.The glaze is glossy and bright, the cup broad and solid in my hands.Its beautiful, and receiving it from her feels like the membership card to a club I really want to join.Grasping the handle, I turn the mug upside down to see if shes signed it.Sure enough, theres something etched into the unglazed bottom.I have to squint to read the tiny letters.Dear Ryan.Thank you for making Jamie so happy.He loves you and so do we.Welcome to the Canning clan.Oh boy.Theres a burn at the back of my throat, and I concentrate hard on settling the mug back into the box.I spend more time than necessary tucking the tissue paper around it with the care of someone performing neurosurgery.When Im finally ready to look up again, Jamies mom is waiting for me.The warm look in her eye makes the sting in my throat even worse.I try to give her a casual smile, but I cant quite pull it off.Nobodys ever said anything so sweet to me.Nobody except Jamie.As if Ive summoned him, a warm hand slides onto my lower back.I adjust my stance just a fractional degree, leaning in to that hand.Cindy is still watching us.She gives a quick wink I know is just for me.Then, just as quickly, her face is all business.She claps her hands once.Okay, troops!The turkey is in the oven, but theres still some heavy lifting to be done!I need someone to saut the vegetables for stuffing.I need someone to start the grill.I need two people to whip the cream!And the rest of you get the heck out of my kitchen.Without ceasing their chatter, the Cannings move around the kitchen, opening and shutting cabinets and passing around bottles of beer.Jamie doesnt leave my side, though.He and I are the calm eye of a friendly, familial hurricane.And I hope the storm will never pass.~Thank You~            Thank You for

a preview of US.US  1      Wes   Vancouver is a beautiful city, but I cant wait to leave it.Weve just finished the longest road trip on our schedule, and I cannot fucking wait to go home.Standing in a fancy hotel room overlooking the waterfront, I shake the tissue paper out of a shirt I just bought at the boutique around the corner.Since Ive been living out of my suitcase for so long, Im out of clean laundry.But this is a great shirt, and it looked at me as I passed the storefront on my way back from signing autographs at a charity luncheon.I unbutton it and slip it on.In the hotel mirror, I check the fit, and it looks fine.Great, even.The cotton is a fine weave, and theres a lime green checked pattern shot through the fabric.Its very British, and the lively color reminds me that it wont always be February.Now that my dress code includes a suit and tie three or four times a week, Ive had to pay more attention to my wardrobe.In college I wore a suit maybe three times a year.But its no hardship because I like clothes.And the hotel mirror says they like me, too.Im a sexy motherfucker.If only the one person I care about was here to appreciate it.Last night we obliterated Vancouver, and its not bragging to say that I was the reason why.Two goals and an assistmy best showing yet.Im having the kind of rookie season that makes headlines.Though right this second Id trade it all for a night in front of the TV with Jamie and a blowjob.I am beat.Whipped.Knackered.Luckily, all thats left of this trip is one more ride on the teams jet.I grab my phone off the desk and unlock it.With the selfie cam, I shoot a picture of my abs, the shirt parted to reveal my six pack, my hand over my crotch.It took me a while to figure out that Jamie has a thing for my hands.I swear he likes them more than my dick.I send the picture.No commentary needed.The hotel room gets one last glance, but Ive packed everything.Ive learned in a hurry not to leave charging cords and toothbrushes behind.Were on the road so often that packing has become my new skill.My phone vibrates with a text.Grrrr.Just get home, would you?I dont need any pics.My poor lonely dick is so hard.That reminds me of old vaudeville jokes.So I reply, How hard is it?Hard enough to pound nails into our bare walls, he replies.Its true that we havent exactly decorated our apartment.We both work a lot and theres been no time.But, as always, sex is a greater priority than home decor.Show me, I beg.Theres a reason I keep my phone locked down.Jamie and I like to indulge in some private photography.He doesnt answer, though.Maybe he isnt at home.Its afternoon in Vancouver, which means its later in Toronto Fuck.Im sick of doing this math all the time.I just want to go home.I grab my suitcase and head downstairs.A few of the guys are already waiting in the lobby, just as eager to get home as I am.I wander over to where theyre standing.Jesus, Matt Eriksson says as I approach.My wife better be home and naked when I get there.And the kids had better be asleep.With, like, fucking earplugs in their little ears.Eight days is a long time, I inwardly agree.But I dont say it out loud, because even though my teammates are great guys, I dont engage in these discussions.Its not my style to lie and pretend theres a girl at home waiting for me.And Im not ready to tell them who is.So I keep my own counsel.Except Erikssons Nordic features have turned in my direction, and a goofy grin breaks out on his face.Shit, my eyes!I think Im blind.Why?I ask halfheartedly.Eriksson is always joking about something.That shirt!Jesus.Seriously, the veteran Will Forsberg says, laughing as he covers his eyes with one hand.Its so bright.Its so gay, Eriksson corrects.This comment doesnt faze me in the least.This shirt is Tom Ford, and its killer, I mutter.Bet you twenty bucks it shows up on the puck bunny blogs before the end of the week.Attention whore, Forsberg accuses.More than any of the other guys on the team, Forsberg eats up the media attention we get.When my mug started showing up on HockeyHotties.com, he didnt appreciate the competition.Jokes on him, though.He can keep the entire population of puck bunnies.Just sayin, Eriksson presses, you could do well in the bars on Church Street in that shirt.Yeah?I ask.You know from personal experience?That shuts him up.But Blake Riley is squinting at my chest now.Hes a big puppy dog of a guy with messy brown hair and no filter.Its, like, hypnotizing almost.It says, Yowza.I fucking dare you to look away.It says, Three hundred dollars, please, I correct.Its expensive to look this good.Blake snorts, and Forsberg says I should ask for my money back.Then the topic moves on to another brand of smack talk and speculation that the bus wont ever show up and that well all die of blue balls in Vancouver.Eventually we board, though.I take a seat alone.Were halfway to the airport when my phone buzzes with a text.I have it set so that none of my texts (especially the photos) show up on the screen unless Im logged in.Its a pretty crucial precaution, and the text Jamie has just sent me proves why.When I authenticate my thumbprint, the screen fills with a picture that is not safe for work.Its both dirty and hysterical all at once.Jamies very hard dick fills the shot.Only its angled toward the wall where the full, pink head leans against a flat nail that its presumably pounding.And Jamie has used some app to draw a happy face on his cockhead.The effect is startlingly transformative.His dick looks likean expressive, alien creature performing some minor home repair.I give a snort of laughter.And here they thought my shirt was gay.Ill show you gay  Wesley?Blake rises from the seat behind me to say something, and I press down on the menu button of my phone so hard that my knuckle cracks.Yeah?I wonder what he saw.Remember how I asked you whether you liked living at 2200 Lake Shore?Sure?My stuff got moved there yesterday.Im your new neighbor on the fifteenth floor.Seriously?Thats great, man, I lie.When hed asked me if I liked the place, I should have told him all the drawbacks.Its too far from the subway.The cold wind off the waterfront is a bitch.Nothing against Blake, but I dont need any of the neighbors to know me.I work pretty hard to fly under the radar.Yeah, the view is killer, right?Ive only seen it during the day, but the lights at night are probably spectacular.They are, I admit.As if I care.The view of my boyfriends face is the only one I want right now.And we still have a four hour flight until I get home to him.You can help me find all the best bars in the hood, Blake suggests.Ill buy the first round.Awesome, I say.Fuck, Im thinking.It takes eighteen years to get back to Toronto.By the time weve landed and gotten our luggage back, its seven oclock.Im really looking forward to spending some time with Jamie, but theres a deadline.He has to leave at six oclock tomorrow morning for an away game in Quebec with his major juniors team.We have eleven hours, and Im still not there yet.Every red light on the way home makes me seethe.But finally Im pulling into the parking garage (a feature of the building that Id boasted about to Blake, damn it).I wheel my giant duffel into the elevator and luckily the car climbs toward our tenth floor apartment without any stops.I fish my keys out so theyre ready in my hand.At long last, Im twenty paces away, then ten.Then Im opening our door.Hey babe!I call out like I always do.I made it.I drag my duffel over the threshold, then toss my suit coat on top, abandoning these things beside the door, because all I need now is a kiss.Only then do I notice that our apartment smells amazing.Jamie has cooked dinner for me.Again.He is the perfect man, I swear to God.Hey!he calls, emerging from the hallway leading to our bedroom.Hes wearing jeans and nothing else exceptand this is unusuala beard.Do I know you?He gives me a sexy smile.I was going to ask the same thing.Im staring at the sandy blond beard.Jamie has always been clean shaven.I meanweve known each other since before facial hair.He looks different.Older, maybe.And hot as blazes.Seriously, I cant wait to feel that beard against my face, and maybe my balls Jesus.The blood is already rushing south, and Ive been home fifteen seconds.And yet Im just stuck there in the middle of the room for a moment, because even though its been eight months since Jamie and I started up together, Im still a little stunned at my own good fortune.Hi, I say again, stupidly.He walks forward, his easy gait so familiar that my heart breaks a little bit.He puts his hands on my traps and squeezes the muscle there.Dont go away for so long.If you do that again, Im going to have to sneak into your hotel room on the road.Promise?I ask, and it comes out like gravel.Hes close enough now that I can smell the ocean scent of his shampoo and the beer he drank while he waited for me.If I ever get a winning lottery ticket and a day off, Ill do it, he says.Hotel sex after a game?Sounds hot.Now Im measuring the distance to our sofa and counting the layers of clothes Ill need to remove in the next ninety seconds.But Jamie takes his hands off my shoulders.I ate already, but your plate is in the oven.I just put it in there a few minutes ago.Chicken enchiladas.They should take fifteen minutes to warm up.Thanks.My stomach grumbles and he grins.I guess Im hungry for more than one thing.Want a beer?Do I ever.Ill get em.Sit down.Cue up the next episode.We can watch it while we wait.I sound overly polite to my own ears, but coming home after a road trip usually feels a little weird.Theres this brief but awkward re entry that I hadnt known to expect.I have little use for the domestic chatter my married teammates share.But if I were the sharing kind, it would be tempting to askwill it always be this way?Do the guys whove been coupled up for ten years feel it, too?Or is it the newness of our relationship that makes things a little odd for an hour or two whenever I come home?Wish I knew.My first stop is our open plan kitchen for two beers, which I open and then deposit on our coffee table.Weve lived here almost six months, and still there isnt much furniture.Weve both been too busy to really furnish the place.But we have the real necessities: a giant leather sofa, a kickass coffee table, a rug and a big TV.Ohand theres a wobbly armchair that I rescued off the curb and kept over Jamies objections.He calls it the death chair.Jamie gives it wide berth, insisting that it has bad karma.You can take the boy out of California, but you cant take the California out of the boy.I need to change, so I take a step toward our bedroom.But then I stop to ask him a question.Hey, what do think of this shirt?I picked it up today, because I ran out of clean stuff.Jamie points the remote at the TV.Its very green, he says without turning to look.I like it.Me too, then.He turns and the beard catches me off guard again.But his smile sends me jogging toward our bedroom.The bed is made up perfectly, so I toss my trousers, my very green shirt and my tie on the comforter, in a hurry to get back to Jamie.I throw on a pair of sweats and make it back to the living room to find Jamie propped into the corner of the couch on his side, his legs stretched out across the cushions.I dont bother pretending to play it cool.I lay down right in front of him, my head against his shoulder, my back to his front.Shit, I complain when I realize my error.I left the beers out of reach.He clamps a hand over my abs.Go, he says.I stretch with both hands for our bottles and he prevents me from falling on the floor.While the table is positioned perfectly for our feet when were sitting up, this little maneuver is for beer emergencies while were cuddling.They happen sometimes.I pass his bottle over my head and hear him take a swig.The opening credits for Bansheeour current showare rolling.You didnt cheat on me while I was gone, did you?I ask.Wouldnt dream of it.The last episode wasnt a cliffhanger, though.So you could say I havent really been tested.I snort into my beer and lean back into the solid warmth of his chest.Usually Im really invested in this show, with its freaky plot and crazy fight scenes.But tonight its just an excuse to be skin to skin on the couch with my man while my dinner reheats.His beard tickles my ear, and thats unexpected.I tilt my head back so his beard brushes my face, too.I cant see the TV at all, and I just dont care.He dips his chin and rubs the beard against my cheek, then brushes his lips across my neck, leaving shivers in his wake.What do you think?he asks quietly.I turn toward him carefully so as not to spill my beer.You look fucktastic.Like J Tim after he left NSYNC and got hot.But I want to feel it on my balls before I weigh in.He tips his head back and laughs suddenly, and thats when the road trip ice dam breaks.Its just us again and his easy laugh and the comfort I feel when hes around.Yesss...I drop my head and lick his throat right below the border of the beard.Then I suck on his skin gently.Jamie stops laughing and relaxes his body against mine.Were skin to skin from the waist up, and the feel of his heartbeat against mine makes me want to weep with gratitude.I nuzzle my nose through his fledgling beard, taking a circuitous route toward his mouth.The hair is softer than I expected.Fuck.Kiss me already, he whispers
