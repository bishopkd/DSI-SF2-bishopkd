    When her nausea kicked up for the umpteenth time that day, Kari Worthington left the brides room, crossed the hall, and slipped into the bathroom.Locking the door behind her, she leaned against it for a moment to keep from throwing up.Then she stumbled across the room, kicked the train of her dress out of the way, hiked up her skirt, and sat down on the toilet lid.She buried her head in her hands as best she could with her veil in the way, wishing her stomach would quit churning and that horrible, breathless, gaspy feeling would go away.A strand of bright auburn hair escaped the monstrous pile on her head and curled down her cheek.She tried to stuff it back, but it was hopeless.It had taken the stylist more than an hour that morning to gather her hair and incarcerate it at the crown of her head, and the woman had frowned the whole time.That was nothing new.Kari had spent her whole life with everybody around her trying to stuff parts of her back into placeboth parts that showed and parts that didnt.She tried to tell herself it was just nerves, that every bride felt like this on her wedding day because marriage was such a big step.But was that really true?Did every bride really need a barf bag only half an hour before marrying the man of her dreams?No.Assuming her groom really was the man of her dreams.She thought about Greg.Handsome, intelligent, serious Greg, who had dropped by her office a year ago and asked her out.It wasnt the first time a man at work had done that, but as time went on, they tended to lose interest in spite of her family connections.Something about her unusual outlook on life tended to make them slowly drift away, and pretty soon shed be out there on that limb by herself all over again.As it turned out, though, Greg endured her offbeat personality like a real trouper.But sometimes she thought he seemed too accommodating, as if she were an applecart he didnt want to upset.After all, there were big advantages to being married to the bosss daughter.Kinda made a guy fireproof.Not that Greg would ever get fired.He was a younger version of her father, right down to his designer suits and his iPhone tapping and his power lunches.Anytime she was around him, she felt as if she should be standing up straight even when she was lying flat on her back.And speaking of lying flat on her back  Sex with Greg had always been okay.Justokay.Not that shed ever had sex that was better than okay to compare it to, but she knew it had to be out there somewhere.Why else were all those odes and sonnets and love poems of yesteryear written, not to mention about a million love songs since the beginning of time?People were out there living and loving with all their hearts, and sometimes Kari lay awake at night, fervently wishing she was one of them.She and Greg had dated for a year.Then came the ring.Then their engagement party.The minister who performed their premarital counseling pronounced them a match made in heaven.But Kari remembered thinking that the priests blessing had less to do with her compatibility with Greg and more to do with the fact that her father was extraordinarily wealthy and believed wholeheartedly in tithing.Through it all, Kari had just let herself get swept along.There had always been a dress to try on, a caterer to consult, the wedding planner from hell to endure.One week passed, and then the next.Then came the Big Day, and what was she doing?Sitting on a toilet lid in her wedding dress feeling as if she was going to throw up.For all that Greg was nice and accommodating and unerringly patient, she saw the looks her father exchanged with him sometimes.I know shes a handful, her fathers eyes would say, and Gregs would say, Dont worry, sir.I can handle her.You can count on me.She heard a knock at the door.Miss Worthington!Oh, God.Not Hilda.She couldnt take one more moment of Hilda Baxter.Stuart Worthington had spared no expense for his only childs wedding, including hiring the wedding planner to the rich and famous.Today she looked like a gigantic prune in her multilayered indigo dress, her face all puckered with irritation, and if she didnt leave Kari alone, she was going to wrap her hands around the womans neck and squeeze until her eyes bugged out.Times running short!Hilda shouted through the door, sounding more like a prison guard than a wedding planner.You need to be walking down the aisle in exactly twenty three minutes!Kari closed her eyes.Twenty three minutes.In only twenty three minutes she would be a married woman.Twenty three minutestwenty three minutestwenty three minutes  The words reverberated inside her head so maddeningly that she put her fingertips to her temples and rubbed hard, trying to drive them away.Shed just about succeeded when a new mantra took over.Twenty two minutestwenty two minutestwenty two minutes  Kari jerked her head up, trying to shake that thought away.She had to do this.It wasnt just Greg and her father and Hilda and all those guests.It was Jill, too, who was waiting in the brides room to join her on that trek up the aisle.Jill had been her best friend since theyd roomed together at Rice University, and now Jill was the only one Kari wanted standing next to her when she got married.Kari imagined the look of disbelief that would spring to Jills face if she told her she was having second thoughts.After all, Jill thought Greg was the catch of the century.But that was mostly because she had a thing for the GQ type.She didnt really know Greg.Most of the time, Kari felt as if she didnt, either.Her second thoughts were nothing new.Shed been having them for some time now.Shed just thought that the happy, gushy bride thing would take over the closer the wedding got and shed realize how silly she was being.Now all she could think of was escaping.She froze.Leave her own wedding?Could she do that?She took a deep, shaky breath, trying to settle her nerves, but her stomach still felt as if it was tumbling around in a clothes dryer.She grabbed her tote bag shed brought to the bathroom with her, fished out her car keys, and stared at them.There it was.Her ticket out of there.She dropped the keys to her lap.Good heavenswhat was she thinking?She couldnt just get into her car and drive away.What kind of a crazy person did something like that?She put the keys back into her tote bag and rose from the toilet lid.Looking in the mirror, she straightened her veil as best she could, then opened the bathroom door.The door to the brides room was dead ahead.If she was going to marry Greg, it was now or never.And never wasnt an option.But all at once Kari imagined what it would be like when she went back inside.Jill would fluff the train of her dress, telling her one more time how lucky she was.Hilda would clap her hands and herd her toward the altar, where Greg would be waiting, eager for the last block of his perfectly structured life to fall into place.For one of the few times in his life, her father would be smiling, the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders as he married off his kooky daughter to a younger, more resilient version of himself.In exactly twenty one minutes she would become  No, no, no!I cant do this!The words rang so loudly inside Karis head that for a moment she wondered if shed screamed them out loud.Suddenly her feet felt fused to the floor, as if her dainty wedding slippers were stuck inside concrete blocks.Then, out of the corner of her eye, half a dozen steps down the hall, she saw a sign that made her breath stick in her throat.EXIT.She stared at it, mesmerized by the glowing red neon.Suddenly she had the most irrational feeling that the only place where there was oxygen to breathe was outside this church, and if she didnt leave right now, shed fall over, turn purple, and die on the spot.Maybe never was an option after all.Without another thought, Kari pulled her keys out of her tote bag and hurried down the hall.She hit the bar on the security door and swept it open, running into the secluded side parking lot of the church.She clicked the remote to unlock the drivers door of her Lexus, suddenly met with the challenge of the century: cramming her dress along with herself behind the wheel.Fortunately, a whole lot of motivation kicked in, and in a matter of seconds, she was stuffed in, strapped in, and ready to go.With a shaky hand, she stabbed at the ignition with the key.She managed to insert it on her third try, feeling like a lifer going over the fence at Huntsville.She paused for a moment and glanced back, sure she would see people pouring out of the church to try to stop her, but no.They were all still inside, blissfully ignorant of the fact that everything was in place for the wedding of the year, except maybe a bride.But in the end, would anybody be all that surprised?For once in Karis life, her history of rash, impulsive behavior was going to pay off.Thats Kari, theyd all say.Running away from her own wedding.Could we really expect anything else?Kari knew that a more confident woman would be able to look her fianc dead in the eye and tell him she didnt want to marry him.But she knew if she did, Greg would try to talk her out of it.Then her father would get into the mix.Then Jill would tell her again what a catch Greg was and beg her to reconsider.Then Hilda would freak out and start throwing commands around like a third world dictator, and all hell would break loose.If Kari actually had a backbone, she could have endured all that, but right now it felt like wet spaghetti.In no time, theyd be shoving her up the aisle and shed be saying those vows, and before she knew it, shed be a miserable married woman for the rest of her life.She took a deep, shaky breath.This was it.Her moment of truth.She could stay and continue living as she always had, with other people pushing her around, or she could take charge of her own life.It was time to take charge.She started the car and drove out of the parking lot to a side street behind the church, pretty sure nobody had seen her.Once on the main road, though, she realized she had no clue which direction to go.North to Dallas?Or west to Austin?Austin.It was a weird city.Oddball people lived there.Since shed always been one of those herself, shed blend in better.And it was closer.She could drive there, get a room at a nice hotel like the Driskill or the InterContinental, order something large and chocolate from room service, and then sit back and figure out what to do next.Then all at once she thought about Boo, her precious little terrier Jill was taking care of while she was on her honeymoon.Right now Kari had no plan.How long would she have to stay gone until the heat was off?Hell be okay.Jill will take care of him.Just go!But as Kari pulled up to the next stoplight, guilt crept in.No matter how wrong this marriage would be, she couldnt leave without saying something to somebody.She decided to text Greg, knowing hed have his iPhone with him even as he was ready to walk up the aisle.On vibrate, of course, but with him nonetheless, because that was the kind of guy he was.And thatthat right therewas part of the problem.Her ringtone was a frog croaking, which made her smile every time she heard it.How was she supposed to marry a man whose ringtone sounded likeof all thingsa telephone ringing?Im so sorry, she punched in.I cant marry you.Its not you, its me.Im justsorry.Ill be in touch later.Then guilt raised its ugly head again.Greg didnt deserve this.He didnt deserve being left at the altar in front of three hundred people.Then she thought about those looks between him and her father, the ones that said she wasnt going to be so much Gregs wife as she was a rock around his neck he was willing to endure.In a few decades, when Stuart Worthington died and went to that big boardroom in the sky, it would all be worth it to Greg.And it would be worth it to her father, too, to spend eternity knowing his flighty, flaky daughter was well in hand.I didnt pick him, Dad.You did.And something about that made her guilt melt away.Kari stared at the text message, trying to think of something else to say, but there really wasnt anything, so she hit send.Then the light turned green, and she hit the gas.As Marc Cordero went down the elevator of San Jacinto Hall to get Angelas last box from the car, he wondered where along the way hed lost his mind.He should have insisted she go to a smaller school.Or maybe to junior college for a year or two.Hell, he should have locked her in her bedroom and thrown away the key so hed never have to deal with any of this.The University of Texas had sounded so safe and civilized when the college counselor at her high school had talked about it, and when he and Angela visited the campus, it had seemed relatively tame.Of course, that had been during the summer session, when only a fraction of the place was occupied.Neither of those things had prepared Marc for the chaos of move in day.The madness had actually begun an hour ago, twenty miles outside Austin.Marc had followed Angelas car with his truck, which he was using to help haul all her belongings to campus.Theyd crept along the highway for what seemed like forever.Marc had sworn there had to be a five car pileup ahead, but it turned out that it was just a traffic jam caused by students heading to UT.Unbelievable.The moment the campus came into view, Marc got a sick, sinking sensation in his stomach.Lack of control always did that to him.Dropping his daughter off at this place was making him feel more out of control than he had for the past eighteen years, and that was saying a lot.Angela, on the other hand, got out of her car, took one look at the campus, and her face lit up exactly the way it had when she was six years old and saw Magic Kingdom for the first time.Six years old.Magic Kingdom.Where the hell had the time gone?Marc grabbed the last box from his truck and headed back into the building, sidestepping one person after another, feeling as if he was navigating a sidewalk in Shanghai.A few minutes later, he got off the elevator and headed down the hall to the twelve by sixteen foot space Angela was sharing with a girl from Lubbock whod also taken potluck on a roommate.They seemed to get along well already, which he guessed was a good thing, except the girl had a tattoo of some Chinese symbol on her upper arm, a ring through her nose, and frizzy hair dyed death black.Angela lifted her arms to put a framed photo onto the top shelf of her bookcase, hiking up her shirt.It was one of those midriff things she wore with jeans slung a few inches below her belly button, which was pierced with a silver ring.God in heavenwhy had he given in on that?Because shed begged for weeks, driving him crazy until hed finally told her she could pierce anything she could cover up later for a job interview.Then hed read something in one of her magazines about labia piercing, and that was when hed known for a fact that this parenthood thing had gotten totally out of control and he didnt stand a chance anymore.Where do you want this?Marc asked.On the dresser, Angela said.He set the box down and turned back, brushing his hands together, but before he could ask Angela if she needed any help unpacking or maybe hanging some stuff on the walls, she said, Ill walk you back downstairs.Marc wasnt ready for this.He was even more not ready than he imagined hed be.Uhokay.He turned to Angelas roommate.It was nice to meet you.Nice to meet you, too, Mr.Cordero, the girl said with a smile, but her eyes said, Now go away.Marc and Angela walked back to the elevator lobby.The elevator doors opened, and three boys got off.As they passed by, one of them eyed Angela with too much interest, a hulking jock type who looked as if he was itching for another notch on his bedpost.What are you looking at?Marc growled.The kid stopped.Swallowed hard.Uhnothing, sir.Thats right.Youre looking at nothing.And nothing is over there.My daughter is over here, and shes not nothing.So if youre looking at nothing, youre not looking at her.Are we clear on that?The kids eyes went big as searchlights.Yes, sir.Now, beat it, Marc snapped.As the kid hurried off with his buddies, Angela spun on Marc, looking horrified.Dad!Why did you do that?Nothings changed just because youre here and Im in Rainbow Valley, he said, striding onto the elevator.No dumb jock just looking to get laid is going to mess with you.So what are you going to do?Angela said, following him onto the elevator.Drive an hour so you can kick his ass?Dont think I wont.She stabbed the down button on the elevator panel.I cant believe you dont trust me.I trust you.Its guys like him I dont trust.Could you embarrass me any more, Dad?she said, throwing her arms into the air.Huh?Is it even possible?Didnt she get it by now?He just wanted her to be safe.That was all.But in this placegood God.He saw danger around every corner.Why didnt she?Right about then, their tiny town seemed like a 1950s sitcom set in comparison.Everybody knew everybody else in Rainbow Valley, so kids knew if they got out of line, word would eventually get back to somebody who would shove them back in.Marc had always been able to intimidate Angelas boyfriends with a frown, a gruff voice, and a few subtle words of warning.In fact, there had been times when he swore he was smiling, but Angela told him he still looked pissed, which meant he scared her boyfriends to death.That was fine with him if it meant they kept their distance.But what was he supposed to do now?Could he make sure they didnt mess with his daughter when he was an hour away in Rainbow Valley?The problem was that he knew what teenage boys were like because hed been one.Things could happen you never expected and certainly werent ready to deal with.It was funny how after all these years he could barely remember what Nicole looked like, only that hed been crazy in love with her and teenage sex had seemed like a wondrous gift from God.Then came Angela.A month later, Nicole was gone.Couldnt handle being a mother.As if Marc had been any more prepared to be a father.In the years that followed, hed felt as if he didnt have a clue what he was doing.Angelas childhood seemed like nothing but a blur in his mind right now.Then came the god awful early teenage years, with hormones running rampant and all that shouting and door slamming, making him feel as if he was doing everything wrong and shed be rolling her eyes at him for the rest of their lives.But the older she got, the more things leveled out, until it looked as if the sleepless nights and the constant worry and the occasional heartache were giving way to the kind of warm, comfortable relationship hed always wanted them to have.And as he looked at his daughter now, skimpy shirt and all, he thought maybe hed done a pretty damned good job of raising her.Youre right, Marc said as the elevator doors opened on the first floor.I shouldnt have embarrassed you.Youre not a kid anymore.I know you can take care of yourself.Those words came harder to him than anything else, because he wasnt sure he believed them.He knew hed better believe them, though, if he expected to get any sleep for the next four years.Angela gave him a little shrug.Its okay.That guy looked like a jerk, anyway.That was Angela.So forgiving.Sometimes a little too forgiving.He wanted to shout at her, If you meet a guy who behaves badly, dont you dare excuse it!But if she hadnt learned that lesson already, was repeating it now going to make any difference?As they walked to his truck, Marc dreaded every step he took more than the one before it.He clicked open his door with the remote, then turned back to Angela.Do you want me to stay for a while?Maybe take you and your new roommate to get a bite to eat?Angela looked back over her shoulder.Uh  Marc held up his hand.Never mind.You already have plans.Its just that Kim and I thought wed walk around campus and check things out a little.Just to see whats going on.You know.Silence.I dont like missing harvest this year, Angela said.You hate harvest.Yeah, I know, she said with a little shrug, folding her arms and staring down at her blue frosted toenails.But its all hands on deck, you know?Marc felt a stab of remembrance.That was what hed told her from the time she was old enough to snip grapes off of vines.At this vineyard, everybody pulls his weight.And that goes double if your name is Cordero.Uncle Daniel is coming back, Marc said.Well get it done.She nodded, then smiled briefly.Do you remember the time when I was six and I ate fifty four Tempranillo grapes?That felt like a hundred years ago.Had it really been only twelve?I was thrilled you could count that high.Purple puke isnt pretty, is it?Not in the least.Why didnt you stop me?Because experience is the best teacher.Angela looked over her shoulder at the sea of students, then back at Marc.Then maybe Id better go experience some stuff, huh?This is it.Its time for you to go, old man.So go.Call me if you need anything, he told Angela.I will.Or even if you dont.She nodded.For a few seconds, neither one of them spoke.Then Angelas face crumpled.She took a step forward and wound her arms around his neck in a desperate hug.Suddenly she was six years old again, with her little hands holding on tightly because of a bad dream or a scraped knee, or sometimes just because hed been twice as important to her because he was Dad and Mom all rolled into one.As he held her tightly, she whispered, I love you, Dad, into his ear, and he whispered that he loved her, too.Finally she pulled away, sniffing a little.He opened the door to his truck and got inside.She took a few steps back from the curb and wiped tears from her eyes.As Marc started the car, he was pretty sure he was going to cry, too, and he hadnt done that since he was seven years old.No.Get yourself together.This is a good thing.For the first time in eighteen years, your life is your own.He put the truck in gear.Angela waved good bye, and he waved back.As he drove away, he glanced in his rearview mirror to see her turn around and walk away from him and into her new life.It was time for him to do the same.By the time he was heading back toward Rainbow Valley, he was ticking off all the reasons why this new  in his life was going to be a good thing.But before he could change his life completely, he had to get through harvest.Daniel would be there in a few weeks.That had been their agreement.As soon as Angela was in college, Daniel would come back to Cordero Vineyards to assume responsibility for the family business for the next three years, carrying on the tradition Marc had guarded all this time.Once his brother took over, Marc intended to hop on his motorcycle and hit the open road.Where hed go, he didnt know.That was the most amazing feeling of all.He didnt know.To have the next three years of his life ahead of him virtually unscripted was something he couldnt have imagined when hed changed his first diaper eighteen years ago.And once he was motoring down the open road and happened to meet a woman who was out for a good time, he was going for it.The only women he intended to have anything to do with were ones who wanted what he wantedgreat sex with no strings attached.He couldnt even imagine what that was going to be like, but he sure as hell intended to find out.To kick things off, at eight oclock tonight he intended to jump headfirst into the life of bachelorhood that becoming a father at seventeen had never allowed him to live.He was going to sit in his brand new La Z Boy recliner in front of the sixty inch LED TV hed bought last weekend and watch a preseason football game.But first he was going to stop at the Pic N Go and buy as much junk food as he could get his hands on, crap he rarely kept in the house because parents who put sugar and trans fats in front of their kids these days were evidently going to hell.But if he chose to get a little diabetes and heart disease himself, that was his business.It wasnt as if he hadnt watched a ball game in the past eighteen years, but tonight was different.He didnt have to worry that Angela was out with friends and she hadnt come home yet, or that hed turn around to see an army of teenagers traipsing through his house, or that he needed to put a decent dinner on the table for his kid so the food police didnt come after him.Tonight it was just him alone in the house with no responsibility for anyone but himself, with nothing to do except cheer on the Cowboys and clog his arteries.And he was going to make the most of it.Then he thought about Angela and felt a flicker of worry, along with an empty spot inside him that came from missing her already.He thought about calling her, then thought again.You taught her right.Now let her live her own life, and you live yours.He checked his watch.It was still a few hours until kickoff.He looked at the horizon, where dark clouds churned against an iron gray sky.Even though a heavy rainstorm was predicted, hed be home before it hit.In his recliner.In front of his television.Living it up.He felt a moment of worry about the grapes, then brushed it off.Harvest was weeks away, with plenty of time for them to recover from a heavy rainstorm.Rain or no rain, nothing was going to screw up his good mood tonight.Absolutely nothing.He was only thirty five years old.Hed paid his dues.Now it was his turn.As of tonight, he was starting a whole new life.Three hours later, Kari drove along a dark, deserted country road somewhere in the Texas Hill Country, gripping the steering wheel so tightly her fingers ached.Rain fell in such a deluge against her windshield that her wipers could barely sweep it away.The road beneath her tires was growing slicker by the minute.Worst of all, her gas gauge was in the red, which meant if she didnt find a station soon, shed be stuck by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere.Shed intended to get a hotel room in Austin.What she hadnt counted on was a gazillion people swarming the city for move in day at the University of Texas.Theyd sucked up every decent hotel room for miles around, so she decided to head for San Antonio.Then came the rain.Pretty soon the bad weather led to an accident on the freeway, and shed gotten stuck in the snarl of traffic.Her engine had idled for over an hour until she had less than a fourth of a tank of gas left.She finally got the chance to exit the freeway to search for a gas station, only to end up on a road completely devoid of everything.No cars, no people, no buildings, no nothing.It was as if she was driving through a black hole, except there was rain and thunder and lightning.The longer she drove, the more the road wound around until she had no clue which direction she was going.Shed yanked off her veil and tossed it into the backseat about a hundred miles ago, but she was still stuck in her wedding dress.It was compressing her ribs so much that she couldnt breathe, and if she didnt get out of it soon, she was going to keel over and die.Why hadnt she stopped at a McDonalds and changed?She could have changed clothes, grabbed a Big Mac, and been back on the road in ten minutes, which meant that right now shed be comfortable and full.Instead, she was incarcerated inside a wedding dress, starving, with no clue where on earth she was.Shed just been so hell bent on getting to Austin that she hadnt wanted to stop.Then she saw it.Up ahead.Or were her eyes playing tricks on her?No.It was real.Light glimmered faintly through the falling rain.Maybe it was a service station.Maybe one of those deluxe service stations where she could get a cup of coffee and a sub sandwich and a brownie for dessert and wait out the worst of the storm.Then she could ask directions, gas up, and eventually shed get back to the freeway, then to whatever luxury hotel she could find.She would hand her keys to the valet, get a room, ditch this dress, soak in the Jacuzzi tub for about an hour, and then  All at once, something darted in front of her.Her mind barely registered deer before she wheeled the car hard to the right to miss it.As the startled animal scrambled away, Kari felt the bump and grind of the gravelly shoulder of the road beneath her tires.She tried to turn back, but her car slid sideways down a shallow embankment and smacked into a tree.The force of the impact slung her sideways, whipping her neck hard to one side and banging her head.The windshield shattered, and pellets of safety glass rained into the car like a shower of diamonds.And then everything went still.Strangely, the car was still running, but when she turned to see the tree trunk embedded into the passenger door, she realized she wasnt going anywhere.She turned off the ignition, her hand shaking so hard she could barely hold onto the key.The engine died, leaving only the sound of the rain pounding against the car and her pulse throbbing inside her skull.With the windshield gone, rain hit the dashboard, bounced off, and splatted against her face.In a surge of frustration, she pounded the steering wheel and shouted a few curse words at the top of her lungs.When that didnt unsmash her car and put it back up on the road, she clutched the steering wheel and dragged in a deep, ragged breath.Get a grip.Wheres your cell phone?She felt around on the dripping wet seat, then on the floorboard beneath her feet, before she finally found it.Shed turned it off earlier to avoid the deluge of phone calls and texts she knew shed get.When she turned it on now, she felt marginally better when it lit up and the car wasnt completely dark.And she couldnt get a signal.She tossed it to the seat beside her, wondering what in the world she was supposed to do now.She had yet to see anybody else on this godforsaken road.It was dark and cold and wet and her head hurt, and she was starting to get just a tiny bit scared.If shed only stayed in Houston, shed be at her reception right now.Clean and dry and eating and drinking and dancing and  And married.Then she saw it again in the distance.The light shed seen right before going off the road.Where there was light, there was help, right?Unfortunately, it wasnt coming to her.She had to go to it.But walk in this horrible storm?Then again, what was her alternative?She had no windshield so she was already drenched anyway.She might as well try to find help.And if she didnt get out of this dress soon, it was going to squash the last breath right out of her.She grabbed her tote bag and stuffed her cell phone inside it.With a deep breath, she shoved as much dress as she could out of the way, then followed it out of the car, wincing at the pain in her wrenched neck and across her shoulder where the seat belt had dug in.As she climbed the incline to the road, rain hammered her mercilessly, her dress dragging through the mud behind her.When she reached the road, she felt a little woozy.Maybe she should have eaten something today besides half of the granola bar Jill had shoved at her, but shed been so sick at the thought of becoming a married woman that she hadnt been able to eat anything else.And dragging layer after layer of mud caked Duchess satin and Chantilly lace behind her was just about to wear her out.And the rain still came down.Its not a disaster, its an adventure  She kept saying that to herself, over and over, because they said repetition was the key to making yourself believe something.She liked adventures.She lived her life looking for them.But she generally preferred being dry and alive to enjoy them.As she drew closer to the light, a jagged bolt of lightning sizzled to earth, exploding in a loud burst of electricity and momentarily illuminating a sign just up the highway.She slogged through the mud for another few minutes until she reached it.It was a painted wooden sign with grapes and wine bottles and the words Cordero Vineyards in white cursive letters shadowed in bright crimson.Now she realized the light shed seen was coming from a structure on that property.Closer now, it looked like a farmhouse.Unfortunately, it was at the end of a very long driveway, and she was about to faint from exhaustion.Kari imagined the person she hoped would answer the doora grandmotherly woman who would invite her in, fix her a cup of tea, then cluck sweetly over her until the storm let up and she could figure out what to do next.Then another bolt of lightning exploded so close it made even Karis wet arm hairs stand on end.Get out of this rain, or youre going to be a barbecued bride.With a deep breath, she turned onto the property, focused on the light, and kept on walking.Marc checked his watch.It was almost eight.He poured the jar of gooey, fake cheese crap hed microwaved over the tortilla chips, then threw a handful of jalapeo slices on top.Ah.Food of the gods.For tonight and hereafter, to hell with healthy.His new motto: Live fast, die young.He liked the way that sounded, smooth and careless, throwing caution to the wind.Then his brain veered off on a Dad tangent: Yes.Thats an excellent plan.Just make sure your life insurance is paid up first.Crap.Responsibility was going to be a hard habit to kick.He needed to think bachelor thoughts.He stuck a package of Double Stuf Oreos under one arm, then picked up the nachos and a beer and headed to his living room.He put the food on the end table and collapsed in his recliner, tipping it back to maximum comfort level with his feet up and his head on the pillowy backrest.Then he reached for the remote and turned on the game.Outside the rain came down in buckets.Thunder boomed.Lightning crashed.And Marc couldnt have cared less, because he was inside this house where it was warm and dry, and tonight, right there in his living room, the Cowboys were going to beat the daylights out of the Steelers.To complete the picture of total decadence, Brandy lay on the rug at his feet.Hed felt generous tonight and had given her way too many of her favorite dog treats.Now she was lying upside down, asleep and snoring, her bushy golden retriever tail flicking back and forth as she dreamed of chasing rabbits through the vineyard.Marc took a long drink of beer and let out a satisfied sigh.Life didnt get any better than this.The Cowboys won the toss and lined up to receive the kickoff.The Steelers kicker took off toward the ball.And there was a knock at his door.Marc whipped around.Somebody at his door?In this storm?Brandy leaped up and started barking.Marc grabbed the remote, hit the pause button, and went to the entry hall.He opened the door.He blinked.Blinked again.And he still couldnt believe what he saw.A woman stood on his porch.Her hair was hanging in a dripping wad on one side of her head, and rain trickled off her nose.Raindrops clung to her eyelashes, shimmering in the dim porch light.Considering the storm, all that made sense.But what was that monstrosity she was wearing?She looked like Glinda the Good Witch after a bout of mud wrestling.But as he looked her up and down, light slowly dawned, and he had the feeling the first day of his new life had just gone straight to hell.She was dripping wet.She was dirty from head to toe.She looked lost and lonely and helpless.And she was wearing a wedding dress.2    Brandy must have been equally stunned by the woman standing on the porch, because she stopped barking and stood motionless, looking up at Marc with a whimper of confusion.But Im ready, boss.If whatever that thing is steps out of line, Im on it.But the woman wasnt stepping out of line.In fact, she wasnt saying anything.She just stood there staring up at Marc, her eyes wide.He looked past her to the driveway and didnt see a car.How the hell had she gotten there?Can I help you?he asked.A smile flickered on her face, then died.I I kinda had an accident down the road, and I was wondering  Marc came to attention.Accident?What happened?She teetered a little.I was driving, and there was this deerI didnt want to hit him  You swerved to miss a deer?She nodded.And now my car is wrecked.Forget about that.Are you all right?Uhyeah.I think so.All at once, lightning crashed.The womans eyes flew wide open.She came to life, bounding across his threshold, dragging approximately two tons of wet, muddy dress behind her.She spun around, her hand at her throat and her eyes still wide with surprise, acting as if shed just cheated death.Given how lightning was exploding all around his house, maybe she had.Arent you going to shut the door?she said, her voice shaky.Marc closed the door, then turned to face her.There were mascara rings under her eyes.Her hair was dangling in a wet blob, and he couldnt tell what color it was.Maybe a little bit red?Brandy walked back and forth nervously, still trying to make sense of this woman.But if Marc couldnt figure it out, what chance did his poor dog have?What happened to your shoes?he asked.She looked down.I dont know.I think the mud sucked them off my feet about a quarter mile ago.She held her hands out helplessly, looking down at herself.Look at me.Im a mess.This dressoh, God.Hilda would just die if she saw me now!Whos Hilda?My wedding planner.She freaked out when a pearl fell off the train.What would she do if she saw this?Whats your name?he asked.Kari Worthington, she said.You must be somebodyCordero.I saw the sign.Marc Cordero.Now tell me why you were driving around in the country after dark in the middle of a storm wearing a wedding dress.She opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out.Then her eyes slowly filled with tears.Marc felt a glimmer of panic.No!No crying!There was no crisis on earth that couldnt be made worse if a woman started to cry.Why are you crying?he asked, afraid she was going to tell him.I couldnt do it, she said.I couldnt marry Greg.So I ran.Ran?There were only twenty two minutes left.Twenty two minutes before I was going to be a married woman.And I just couldnt do it.You left your own wedding?Her face crumpled, but she kept the tears at bay.Yes.Let me get this straight.You got into a car in this weather in a wedding dress and just drove away?No!Well, not exactly.It wasnt raining when I left Houston.Marc drew back.Houston?You drove all the way here from Houston?Thats over two hundred miles!She held up her palm.Now, its not as bad as it sounds.See, I was going to drive to Austin, but then the hotels were all full because of parents taking kids back to college, so I thought Id go to San Antonio.But when I headed that direction, the rain came and there was an accident and traffic was a mess and I was running out of gas, so I got off the freeway to find a gas station and then I got lost.And then there was the deer, and She shrugged weakly.And here I am.Marc had news for her.It really was as bad as it sounded.You need to call somebody to come get you.No!she said.Whoever I call will talk me into getting married.And I cant do that.Ill be miserable for the rest of my life!All this should have kicked off Marcs usual reaction to a crisis, which was to wade in, take control, and solve the problem, but hed never encountered a problem like this.A woman who ran away from her own wedding into a driving rainstorm?In what weird universe did that happen?Okay, Marc said.Your car.Is it drivable?Well, its kinda wrapped around a tree.No windshield.So I guess Id sayprobably not.Youre two hundred miles from home.Do you know anybody in the area?Anybody at all?She shrugged weakly.To tell you the truth, I dont even know where I am.Didnt you bring a map with you?No.I didnt exactly plan to run away.Still, you might have stopped along the way.Regrouped.Gotten organized.Put a little thought into  All at once she put her hand to her stomach and started to weave, her eyes dropping closed.Marc took hold of her wrist to steady her.It felt cold from the rain and so fine boned he could wrap his entire hand around it.Whats the matter?he asked.Sorry.Im justIm just having a hard timebreathing  Whats wrong?Are you sick?No, she said, her face contorting.Its this dress.Its so tight.And my stomach feels funny.I havent eaten much in the last couple of days.Why havent you eaten?Because my dress was too tight.I needed to be able to get into it on my wedding day.Ill get you some crackers  No.The dress is too tight.If I eat something, Ill barf it right back up.She hadnt eaten because the dress was too tight, but because the dress was too tight, she couldnt eat?One of Marcs biggest pet peeves was circular logic that led nowhere.How did anyone get off a roller coaster like that?And its worse now, she said, her breath fast and shallow.I think the dress is drying and shrinking.I need to get out of it.But you dont have any clothes to put on, Marc said.No.I have clothes.Theyre in my luggage.Wheres your luggage?In my car.And your car is in a ditch.Yeah.Marc sighed.He was no psychic, but he was having no trouble predicting the near future.He was going to be wading through a muddy ditch to pull suitcases out of a wrecked car.Where did you have the accident?East on the highway or west?She looked at him blankly.Never mind, Marc said.Surely youll know which way to go once we reach the gate.The gate?My front gate.Ill take you to your car to get your luggage.Then Ill drop you off at a hotel in town.You can check in, get cleaned up, and change clothes.Then tomorrow you can deal with your car.But the weather  Its letting up.Actually, Marc wasnt too sure about that, but it didnt matter.One way or another, he was taking her to town.Then hed get back to his football game and pretend all this had never happened.Come with me, he said, heading for the kitchen.She trudged along behind him, the train of her dress making a wide, muddy streak across the tile floor.It looked as if a gigantic slug had slithered through his house.As they came into the kitchen, Sasha was in her usual spot on top of the refrigerator.She was Siamese, and from the day Angela brought her home as a kitten, it was as if she knew she came from royal stock.That refrigerator was her throne, and she judged every situation that passed before her like the princess she was sure she was.How about it, Sasha?Does Her Majesty have a solution to this problem?Marc stopped in the mudroom and put on a raincoat and a pair of rubber boots, then grabbed a poncho for Kari.No sense in getting wetter than you already are, he said as he eased it over her head and pulled it down, then tugged the hood up over her blob of hair.The poncho was Day Glo yellow.She looked like Big Bird in a wedding dress.He still didnt know why shed left her fianc at the altar, but in the end it didnt matter.He only knew he wanted this woman out of his house as quickly as possible so he could get back to his new life.A few minutes later, Kari sat in the passenger seat of the biggest pickup truck shed ever seen, listening to the roar of hundreds of horses under the hood as Marc motored down the storm darkened highway.He drove every bit of the speed limit even though the rain still poured.At first she thought, Daredevil, only to realize every move he made seemed careful and measured, as if he knew every hill and curve as well as he knew his own name.As he was stuffing her and her dress into the passenger seat of his truck, shed seen two rifles on a gun rack in the back window of the club cab pickup.Her heart stuttered at the sight, but she told herself to stop being silly.Ignore the guns.This is rural Texas.Five year olds carry guns in rural Texas.Left to her own devices, Kari generally associated with men who played guitars and wrote poetry because at least they understood her creative, disordered mind and didnt cringe when she dyed her hair purple.When she dated men her father approved of, they wore sport coats over their two hundred dollar jeans, talked about the stock market, and got exasperated when she wanted to try a vegan restaurant.Either way, nothing had prepared her for Marc Cordero.He was a big man with a big truck and big guns, and every indication said he wasnt the least bit happy to be taking her anywhere on a night like tonight.He hadnt cracked a smile from the moment hed opened his front door.And as she gave him a sidelong glance now, she forgot her wrecked car, forgot the storm, forgot everything but the man sitting next to her, a man who looked as if he could pick her up and snap her in half if he chose to.But she couldnt say she hated it.She glanced at his hands on the steering wheel, big, strong hands that looked as if they could split firewood without an ax.Underneath that raincoat was a body to match his hands, with a chest and shoulders so broad he could have made two of any of the men she knew.She didnt know exactly what it took to run a vineyard, but it was clear hed gotten his gorgeous body and his golden tan the hard wayby spending long hours working in the sun.She glanced back at his left hand on the steering wheel.No ring.But why was she bothering to look?Because hes sexy as hell, thats why.But that didnt matter.The last thing a pushover like her needed was a man to push her over.If Greg had been able to do it, she wouldnt stand a chance with a man like this one.So you run a vineyard?she asked.Yep.You have a nice house.Its home.That was the one word that described it perfectly.It had a wide front porch with a wooden swing, and on the inside the oak floors, thick rugs, and country kitchen made it feel cozy and warm.For a second her brain flashed to her fathers housethree times the size and cold as ice.Are you sure your car is this direction?Marc asked.Weve gone a long way.I walked a long way.Wait.There it is.Marc slowed down, then made a U turn to pull onto the shoulder near where her car had gone off the road.He shined his headlights on it as best he could, then held out his hand.Keys?She handed him the keys and he got out of the truck.The rain had let up some, but still it pelted him as he walked purposefully down the incline to where her car rested in the ditch.He unlocked the trunk and grabbed two of her biggest suitcases.Shed filled them so full she was sure shed be charged extra at the airport, but Marc lifted them as if they were nothing.He brought them up the hill and stuffed them behind the seat in the extended portion of the club cab.He did the same with the other two.Then he climbed back into the truck and slammed the door, shoving the hood of his raincoat off his head.His boots slopped mud onto the plastic floor mat beneath his feet.Thats a lot of luggage, he said as he put the truck in gear.Where were you going?Bali, she said.Ten days.You needed four bags for ten days?It was my honeymoon.I did a lot of shopping before I left.Hope somebody canceled the trip.Didnt matter.It was a gift from her father.Given his money, that was the last thing he cared about.Forget the vacation to Bali.He could have bought Bali.As they drove away, Kari glanced over her shoulder.What do you think about the condition of my car?Hard to tell until Rick hauls it out.It could be anything from a flat tire and a little body damage to a total loss.Kari watched out the window as they sped down the highway through the shadowed trees.Minutes later they rounded a bend and she saw lights up ahead.Soon they passed a sign that read, Rainbow Valley, Texas.And beneath that, Home of the Rainbow Bridge.Rainbow Valley, Texas?Kari said.Uh huh.Never heard of it.Whats the Rainbow Bridge?Long story.Ask Gus.He loves to tell it.Gus?He and his wife run the bed and breakfast Im taking you to.They passed a few farmhouses on the side of the road.The rain had diminished to a heavy drizzle, and up ahead she saw a water tower with the cartoon faces of two dogs and a cat painted on it.Then she saw the street names.Llama Lane.Persian Place.Appaloosa Avenue.Why are all the streets named after animals?she asked.Another long story.Gus will oblige.Marc slowed his truck and turned onto a street called Rainbow Way.Businesses lined both sides, most of which had begun life as houses and been transformed.They were a mix of architectural styles, or maybe theyd just been added to and subtracted from so much over the years that each one was its own work of art.They were painted fun, cheerful colors.Kari was transfixed.Even through the rain, this place looked delightfully funky, like Oz without the Munchkins.She could only imagine what it looked like on a sunny summer afternoon.They approached a town square.Vintage streetlamps illuminated the falling rain.In the center of the square was a large gazebo painted bright yellow and surrounded by flowering shrubs.The darkness and the rain should have made everything look dreary, but Kari had never seen anything so enchanting in her life.Shed felt a little depressed earlier, but how could anybody look at this place and not feel like dancing?This place is so cute!she said.Look at all the storefronts.WaitCordero Vineyards?You have a shop in town?Yep.We move a lot of wine that way.Its cute, too.Marc just shrugged.Tourists love it, particularly the big animal lovers.Animal lovers?But you sell wine.Yeah.Top Dog Merlot.Crazy Horse Cabernet.He gave her a slight roll of the eyes.We have a wine called Sex Kitten.My sister talked me into that one.Kari smiled.Really?Its one of our best sellers.Unfortunately that means Im stuck with it.Everybody loves doggies and kitties.There are big bucks in that.You dont sound happy about it.On the contrary.Making a buck makes me very happy.I noticed you have a doggy and a kitty.My daughter has a doggy and a kitty.Kari came to attention.You have a daughter?Yes.Does she live with you?Not anymore.I dropped her off at UT this afternoon for her freshman year of college.That astonished Kari.Most men with college age kids were well into their forties.Marc clearly wasnt.So you were in Austin this afternoon, too?Yeah.You dont look old enough to have a daughter in college.Im plenty old enough.She looked at his left hand again.I dont see a ring.Thats because I dont have a wife.Are you divorced?Do you always talk so much?Truthfully?Yeah.Well, I generally dont.So if you keep it up, pretty soon you may be talking to yourself.Kari took the hint, but it was all she could do not to ask a dozen more questions.Some folks thought she was a little nosy, but she liked to think of it as simply being interested in other people.A highly attractive man who was relatively young with a college age daughter and no wife?There had to be a story there, but judging from the inaccessible look on Marcs face, she was pretty sure she wasnt going to hear it.Marc passed the square and turned right onto a street behind it.He pulled into a small parking lot beside yet one more house turned business.It was a three story Victorian painted blue, with a high peaked roof and scrollwork detail.He parked his truck, circled around it, and unstuffed Kari from the passenger seat.As he guided her toward the big front porch, she noticed paw prints painted on the sidewalk beneath her feet and several stone cats along the way peeking out from behind the shrubbery.Marc took her up the steps and through the front door, shoving her dress unceremoniously into the foyer behind her.A little brown and black mutt let out a few barks and trotted over to them.He circled around Kari, sniffing her with the same interest Marcs dog had.Kari looked around, delighted by the interior of the house.To her right was what looked like a parlor.To the left was what had probably once been a living room or library, but it had been rearranged and reworked to create an area for the front desk.Straight ahead was a gorgeous oak staircase with a stained glass window towering over the midfloor landing.It took a moment or two for Kari to realize the stained glass was a representation of Noahs ark.How cool was that?Over the front desk was a sign that read: Animal House.A Bed & Breakfast for Cats and Dogs.Feel Free to Bring Your People.Just then a man stepped through a doorway to stand behind the desk.He had a short swirl of gray hair and wore a pair of bifocals around his neck.At one time hed probably been at least six two, but age had taken its toll and hunched him down to about six feet.He wore a pair of khaki pants and a short sleeved plaid shirt that barely harnessed the belly that lopped over his buckstitched belt.He took one look at Kari and froze.Then slowly he turned his gaze to Marc.I always assumed Id be invited to the wedding.Nobody got married, Gus, Marc said.Not even me, Kari said.She needs a room for the night, Marc said.Or maybe several nights, Kari added.She had a car accident near the vineyard in the middle of the storm, Marc said.Wearing a wedding dress?Long story.Not really, Kari said.I ran away from my own wedding.I got lost on a deserted highway.I swerved to miss a deer and landed in a ditch.I walked to Marcs house.He brought me here so Id have a place to stay.Shes right, Gus said.Thats not long at all.Marc checked his watch.Gus?A room?Just then a small black and white cat leaped onto the counter and sauntered across it, arching her back and rubbing the length of her body along Guss arm.He petted her absentmindedly.Shes pretty, Kari said, stepping forward to pet her, too.Names Fanny, Gus said.Short for Fantasia.One of my grandkids named her after the Disney movie, but Marc still thinks it sounds like a stripper name.Gus?Marc said.Are you in the hotel business or not?Gus smiled a little, then pulled his keyboard across the desk and started poking at it.As he took Karis information, Marc retrieved her luggage from his truck.How many days did you say youre staying?he asked Kari.I dont know.He eyed the four huge suitcases.Sure youre not moving in?You never know, she said with a smile.I like this place.Kari reached into her purse for her credit card, but Gus waved her away.My machines down, he told her.Drop by the desk tomorrow morning.If its working again, Ill run your card.What about incidentals?she asked.We got no incidentals around here.This is a bed and breakfast.You get a bed and breakfast.Movies?We got a bunch of DVDs in the dining room.Take your pick.Just bring them back after you watch them.We have wine and cheese and cookies and such at three oclock every afternoon, if youre interested.Those are freebies.So youll know, Jasper and Fanny arent the only two critters in the place.If any of them end up in your room, be sure to shoo em out before you go to sleep.And watch Fanny.Shell slip into your room and creep under the bed when youre not looking, and then youll find her on your pillow an hour later.Kari thought about Boo, who curled up next to her every night.That had bugged the hell out of Greg, which was just one more thing that should have been a red flag.Gus handed Kari the key to the room.The only rooms I have open right now are on the third floor.Im guessing theres no elevator.Sorry, no.She looked down at her dress, then behind her at the muddy train.It had been all she could do to drag it along as she trudged down the highway after the accident.The dress wasnt even close to dry yet.With the weight of the water it had absorbed, she doubted she could even make it up the stairs.Marc sighed.Wait a minute.He clearly saw the problem, because he took off his raincoat and kicked off his muddy boots.Moving around behind her, he gathered the train of her dress in his arms.Up the stairs, he told her.As she walked up to the midfloor landing, Gus called out to Marc, Estelles in Waymark with Chloe and the new baby, so the bed hasnt been made up yet.Ill bring linens in a minute.By the time Kari made it to the third floor, she was about to drop.She opened the door to room 302.Once inside, Marc let the train fall to the floor.Stay on the hardwood floor to take it off, Marc said.Its easier to clean.Im going down for your luggage.
