Because she bought you clothes last Christmas.And she remembered?Shes Lily.She remembers things like that.And would you take the bag, please?My arm is getting tired.Colin reached up to take it.Whats going to happen if I dont wear them?For starters, you still have to pay me.Then, youll also hurt her feelings, which is the last thing you should do after all the dance lessons.And, of course, youll have to explain to Lily why youre not wearing them.How will she know whether I wear them or not?Because shes here.And she insists that you drop by before you go out.She wants to talk to you.At a bit of a loss, Colin said nothing.Just wear the damn clothes, all right?When Colin still didnt respond, Evan squinted slightly.You owe me.Colin stood in front of the bathroom mirror, acknowledging that it could have been a lot worse.The shirt was actually more burgundy than red, and though it wasnt something he would have picked out for himself, it wasnt half bad, especially with the sleeves rolled up.Hed been planning all along to wear black slacks  more leftovers from his courtroom days  and the shoes were a lot like the ones he already owned, without the scuffs, which meant hed probably needed a new pair anyway.How Lily had known was beyond him, but hed long since given up being surprised by anything she did.In the kitchen, he scribbled out a check to Evan, grabbed his keys, and turned off his lights on the way out the door.Rounding the house, he went up the steps, noting that the door had been left ajar.Pushing it open, he saw Lily and Evan in the kitchen, each holding a glass of wine.Lily set her glass on the counter with a smile.Well, arent you handsome?she declared as she approached.She leaned in and kissed him on the cheek.The color is perfect on you, and Im certain that Maria will find you quite dashing.Thank you, Colin said.It was my pleasure.And Im hopeful that you remember everything we practiced.I assume you went through the steps today?Not today.What on earth did you do?I went to the gym.Of course you did, she said, not hiding her disappointment.You really need to learn to prioritize, and I simply cant let you go until I know for certain that you retained everything you need to know.Im sure Ill be fine.And Im supposed to pick her up in a few minutes.Then well have to make it quick.Evan?she called out.Will you please put on some music?Sure, he said.Grabbing his phone, he tapped a few buttons as he walked over.I just happen to have a song right here.Obviously, Lily had been planning this all along.She reached for Colins hand.Just run me through a bit of everything, okay?At full speed.Colin complied before finally separating from Lily.Good enough?Youre going to dazzle her.Lily winked.Just like you did with the flowers.And you know what else will dazzle her?Evan asked.When Colin turned toward him, he knew that Evans thoughts had taken a serious turn.First your car starts, and then you dont end up getting arrested.Colin had barely finished knocking when Maria pulled the door open.For a long moment, all he could do was stare.Her blouse hugged her curves and her skirt reached only to midthigh; her strappy high heels made her nearly as tall as he was.With a touch of mascara and lipstick, she looked nothing like the professional hed gone to lunch with only a couple of days earlier, nor did she resemble the sun kissed woman on the paddleboard.As he stood before her, he wasnt sure which version of her he most preferred, though this one, he had to admit, was pretty stunning.Youre right on time, she said, giving him a kiss on the cheek.Im impressed.His hands automatically went to her hips.You look beautiful, he murmured.Up close, he caught a whiff of perfume, something floral and understated.Perfect.Thank you, she said.She patted his chest.I like the shirt.Its new.Yeah?For tonight?You could say that.I feel special, she said.And, I have to say, you clean up pretty well.Sometimes, he admitted.Are you ready to go?Just let me grab my purse, and then Im ready.Where are we going?The Pilot House.Wow I love that place.The food is fabulous.So Ive heard.Lily recommended it.Then she obviously has good taste.The restaurant wasnt far, but Colin drove at a leisurely speed with the windows rolled down, both of them enjoying the flickering stars that spread to the horizon and a breeze just strong enough to erase the lingering heat of the day.Near the river, Colin left Market Street, eventually pulling into the restaurants lot.Walking around the car to open Marias door, he reached for her hand and escorted her to the entrance.Once inside, he was surprised to note that it was less formal than hed expected  a clean, unpretentious place with white tables and a million dollar view.The restaurant was crowded, people clustering near the bar while they waited for indoor and outdoor tables.After checking in with the hostess, he followed her and Maria to a corner table with a breathtaking view of the Cape Fear River.Moonlight spilled over the slow moving surface, forming a liquid vein of light between coal dark banks.As Maria stared toward the water, Colin mentally traced the graceful outlines of her profile, watching her hair catch in the breeze.How had she come to mean so much to him so quickly?As if sensing his thoughts, she met his gaze and smiled slightly before stretching her hands across the table.He took them in his, marveling at their softness and warmth.Its a gorgeous night, dont you think?she asked.Gorgeous, he answered, but he knew that he was really referring to her.Sitting across from her, Colin had the strange feeling that he was living someone elses blessed life, someone more deserving than he.And by the end of dinner, after all the dishes had been cleared and the wineglasses emptied and the candles were flickering out, it dawned on him that hed spent his entire life searching for Maria, and only recently been lucky enough to find her.CHAPTER 12      Maria      T  he warehouse was located in a run down neighborhood on the outskirts of town, and the only hint that it served a different purpose than any of the other abandoned warehouses nearby was the scores of cars parked haphazardly on the far side of the building, out of sight from the main road.Not that its sketchy vibe seemed to matter.In addition to the crowd already inside, there was a long line of people  almost exclusively male  still waiting to get in.Many were dragging coolers, no doubt filled with alcohol; others drank beer or sipped from plastic cups as they slowly edged toward the entrance and the music blaring within.Unless they were with a date, girls didnt have to wait in line, and Maria watched as one group after the next cheerfully marched toward the door in tight tops, short skirts, and stiletto heels, ignoring the litter strewn surroundings, whistles, and catcalls.Colin appeared relaxed, taking it all in quietly.When they reached the door, they were met by a heavyset man in sunglasses who was collecting the cover charge.The bouncer studied Colin up and down  no doubt trying to decide whether he was with law enforcement  then did the same to Maria before reluctantly taking the bills Colin was offering and nodding toward the door.Inside, they encountered a solid mass of swaying bodies, and with the booming music, the place shook with a vibrant, barely contained energy.No one seemed to care about the oil stained concrete floor or the lack of dcor or the industrial grade lighting; guys were clustered around their coolers, drinking and shouting to be heard above the music, trying to get the attention of any girl who happened to pass by.Like at most nightclubs, men clearly outnumbered women, and most appeared to be in their twenties or thirties.Maria presumed that the vast majority were working people out for a fun Saturday night.There were, as Serena had noted, some pretty scary looking guys here, too, with tattoos and bandannas representing various gangs and wearing baggy pants that could easily conceal a weapon.Ordinarily that would have made her nervous, but the atmosphere indicated that most people were simply focused on having a good time.All the same, she found herself scouting out possible exits in case trouble broke out.Beside her, Colin was also taking in the scene.He leaned toward her ear.Would you like to move closer to the music?She nodded, and Colin began leading her deeper into the warehouse.They squeezed through the crowd, careful not to bump too hard into anyone, and inched their way to the dance area on the far side of the building, the music pulsing ever louder.Along the way, guys tried to get Marias attention  demanding her name or commenting on her beauty or even trying to pinch her butt  but afraid to give Colin any reason for confrontation, she merely scowled at them in silence.The dance floor was separated from the rest of the warehouse by a makeshift barrier of two by fours nailed together and fastened across metal barrels.Directly opposite them, on pallets stacked against the back wall, was the DJ, his equipment arranged on a fold out table.He was flanked by two speakers the size of refrigerators.The music was loud enough to make Marias chest thump.On the floor, she watched couples move and spin, triggering in her a surge of memories from a time when life seemed more carefree.Leaning closer to Colin, she could smell the cologne he must have put on earlier.Are you sure youre ready for this?Yes, he said, moving past the barrier.Before she knew it, they were surrounded by couples.She was about to tell Colin what to do when he suddenly took her right hand in his left and placed his right hand on her left shoulder blade.And with that, he began to lead her, his steps moving in unison with hers as the music surged around them.Her eyes widened, and when he led her through a perfectly executed spin, followed almost immediately by a second, she was too shocked to say anything at all.Colin merely raised his eyebrows in amusement, making her laugh aloud.And little by little, as one song rolled into the next, she felt herself beginning to let go, losing herself in the music, and in him.It was past midnight when they finally left the jammed warehouse and drove back to her condo.Neither of them said much, both feeling warm and slightly flushed as they navigated the quiet streets.Like he had for much of the past few hours, Colin held her hand, his thumb moving against her skin and making it tingle.As they neared her place, she imagined what might happen if she invited Colin upstairs, and was both frightened and excited by her thoughts.They hadnt known each other long enough, and she wasnt sure she was quite ready yet she had to admit that she wanted him to come up.She wanted their evening together to continue; she wanted him to kiss her again and take her in his arms.Despite her conflicting emotions, she directed him to the parking area behind her condo.After locking the car, they walked up the steps beside each other, both of them quiet.When they reached the door, she fumbled with her keys, her hands trembling ever so slightly as she unlocked the door.Entering and passing through the living area, she turned on the lamp near the couch, but when she turned around, she realized that Colin had stopped at the threshold.He seemed to sense her confusion, offering her a chance to end the evening now, before it went too far.But something had taken hold of her, and tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear, she smiled.Come on in, she said her voice sounding hoarse and foreign to her own ears.Colin quietly closed the door behind him as he took in the living area with its dark pine flooring and crown molding, and the French doors that opened to the small balcony.Though she suspected he probably wouldnt have cared one way or the other, she was suddenly glad shed spent the morning straightening up, right down to fluffing the decorative pillows on the couch.You have a beautiful place.Thank you.Moving closer to examine the framed photos above the couch, he asked, Did you take these?She nodded.Earlier this summer.He studied them in silence  especially the close up of the osprey clasping a fish in its talons and surrounded by droplets of water.Youre very good, he said, visibly impressed.You dont know how many bad shots it took to get these, but thank you.Standing close, she could feel the heat still radiating from his body.Would you like something to drink?I have a bottle of wine in the fridge.Maybe half a glass.Ive never been a big wine drinker.And if you have some water, that would be great, too.Leaving him, she went to the kitchen and pulled a couple of wineglasses from the cabinets.In the refrigerator was a bottle shed opened the night before.She poured two glasses and took a sip before retrieving another glass for his water.Would you like ice?Sure, if its not too much trouble.I think I can handle ice.She handed him the water glass, and watched as Colin drained it.Taking the empty glass from him, she set it on the breakfast bar before gesturing toward the French doors.Shall we go out on the balcony?Im in the mood for a little fresh air.Sounds good, he agreed, reaching for his wineglass.Opening the doors, they stepped onto the balcony.The air was cool against her skin, haze beginning to roll in with the breeze.Traffic was light and the sidewalks stood empty.Streetlights cast a yellow glow, and from the bar at the corner she could hear the faint strains of eighties pop music.He motioned to the rocking chairs off to the side.Do you ever sit out here?Not enough.Which is kind of sad, since the balcony is one of the reasons I bought the condo in the first place.I think I had this idea that Id unwind out here after work, but it usually doesnt turn out that way.Most nights, Ill have a quick dinner and either plant myself at the dining room table or at the desk in the spare bedroom with my MacBook.She shrugged.The whole trying to get ahead thing again, but weve already talked about that, havent we?Weve talked about a lot of things.Does that mean youre getting bored with me already?He turned toward her, his eyes reflecting the evening light.No.You know what I find interesting about you?Colin waited, saying nothing.You dont feel the need to always explain your reasoning when you answer questions.You get straight to the point.The only time you elaborate is when youre asked to do so.Youre a man of very few words.Okay.Thats exactly what I mean!she teased.But all right, youve made me curious.Why dont you elaborate unless youre specifically asked to do so?Because its easier.And it takes less time.Dont you think that including others in your thought process helps them understand you better?That assumes they want to understand me better.And if they do, theyll ask me to explain and then Ill do it.And if they dont ask?Then they probably dont care about my reasoning in the first place.They just want to know the answer.I know I do.If I ask someone what time it is, I dont need a history of clock making and I dont care who gave them the watch, or how expensive it was, or whether it was a Christmas present.I just want the time.Im not talking about that.Im talking about trying to get to know someone.Making conversation.So am I.  But not everyone needs  or even wants  to know why you feel the way you do about something.Some things are better left private.Excuse me?Werent you the one who told me your life story that first night on the beach?You asked questions and I answered them.And you think that works?It has for us.We have no trouble talking.But thats because I ask a lot of questions.Yes.Well, its a good thing I do.Or wed end up like some of those older couples I see in coffee shops who dont say a word to each other while they eat breakfast.Of course, thats probably right up your alley.I can easily imagine you going an entire day without saying anything to anyone.Sometimes I do.Thats not normal.Okay.She took a sip of wine and waved a hand at him.More detail, please.I dont know what normal really means.I think everyone has his own definition, and its shaped by culture, by family and friends, by character and experience, by events and a thousand other things.Whats normal for one person isnt normal for another.For some people, jumping out of airplanes is crazy.For other people, life isnt worth living without it.She nodded, conceding the point.Still  All right.Without me asking a question first, I want you to say how you really feel about something.Something unexpected and completely off topic.Something I wouldnt expect you to say.And then elaborate, without me having to ask a single question.Why?Humor me, she said, nudging him.Just for fun.He rotated the wineglass with his fingers before raising his eyes to hers.Youre amazing.Youre intelligent and beautiful and it should be easy for you to meet someone who doesnt have my past, who hasnt made the mistakes I have Truthfully, it makes me wonder what Im doing here, or why you even invited me.Part of me thinks that all of this is too good to be true and that its going to come crashing down, but even if it does, it wouldnt change the fact that youve already added something to my life, something that I hadnt even realized was missing.Colin paused.When he spoke again, his voice was quiet.Youve come to mean more to me than I think you realize.Before you came along, I had Evan and Lily, and I thought that was enough.But it isnt.Not anymore.Not since last weekend.Being with you makes me feel vulnerable again, and I havent felt vulnerable since I was a kid.I cant say that I always like it, but the alternative would be worse because it would mean not seeing you again.Maria realized shed been holding her breath; by the time he finished, she felt almost dizzy, overwhelmed by his response, and tried to steady herself.Colin, on the other hand, continued to exude an easy confidence, and it was that, more than anything, which allowed her to regain her equilibrium.Im not sure what to say, she admitted.You dont have to say anything.I didnt say it because I wanted a response.I said it because I wanted to.She wrapped both hands around the stem of her glass.May I ask you a question?she asked shyly.About something else?Of course.Why did you act like you didnt know anything about salsa dancing?When we talked about it, I didnt.Lily spent the week giving me lessons.Thats what I was doing on Thursday and Friday nights.You learned how to dance for me?Yes.She turned away and took a sip of wine, trying to mask her amazement.Thank you.And I guess I should thank Lily, too.He flashed a quick smile.Would you mind if I refill my water glass?Im still a bit thirsty.Of course not.Colin stepped away and Maria shook her head, wondering when, or even if, she would cease being surprised by him.Luis had never spoken to her like Colin just had.As she leaned over the railing, she suddenly found it hard to remember what shed really seen in him.On the surface, he was attractive and intelligent, but underneath hed been arrogant and vain.Shed often made excuses for his behavior, and if anyone questioned her feelings, shed reacted defensively.Thinking back, she admitted that shed desperately wanted his approval and not only did he sense that, but he frequently took advantage of it.It wasnt a healthy relationship, she knew, and when she tried to imagine him behaving as Colin had  calling her, bringing flowers, learning to dance  she couldnt.And despite all that, shed loved Luis with an intensity she could still sometimes feel.Earlier, as she and Colin had been dancing, shed caught herself thinking that the night couldnt possibly get any better.And then, all at once, it had.Listening to him express his feelings without fear or regret had left her speechless.She wondered whether she was capable of such a thing.Probably not, but then again, Colin wasnt like most people.He accepted himself, faults and all, and forgave himself for the mistakes hed made.More than that, he seemed to live in the moment without regard for either the past or the future.The greatest revelation was how deeply Colin was able to experience his emotions, perhaps even more deeply than she did.Watching him over dinner and on the dance floor, and hearing his words just now, she knew that if he wasnt in love with her yet, he was on the brink.Like her, he was willing to surrender to the inevitable, an idea that made her hands tremble.As Colin stepped back onto the balcony behind her, she took a long breath, savoring the wave of desire that flooded through her.He leaned over the railing next to her, and as their breaths fell into steady rhythm, she took another sip of wine, the warmth coursing down her throat into her stomach and limbs.Studying his face in profile, she thought again about the way his external calm enveloped the coiled emotions within him, and she suddenly imagined the way Colin might look as he hovered naked above her, his lips gently brushing hers, as they gave themselves over to each other.Her stomach tightened and she felt her mouth curve into a faint smile.Did you mean what you said to me earlier?He didnt answer right away.Instead, he lowered his head before turning to face her.I meant every single word.Feeling a cascade of sensations in her body, she moved closer and kissed him gently on the lips.They were soft and warm, and pulling back, she saw in his expression something akin to hope.She kissed him a second time then and felt her skin begin to come alive as he slid his arms around her.He tugged softly, bringing their bodies together, and in that instant, she began to lose herself in him.She could feel the strength of his chest and arms surrounding her and the warm urgency of his tongue, and she knew with fierce certainty that she needed Colin, all of him.They continued to kiss on the balcony beneath a foggy, star filled sky until she finally reached for his hand.Their fingers intertwined as he kissed the hollow of her neck, the sensation tantalizing and erotic.She shivered, enjoying the sensation before wordlessly leading him to the bedroom.Moments after she woke the next morning, Maria felt the soft glare of the early autumn sun, and the night came rushing back.She rolled over and saw Colin lying on his side, only half covered by the sheet, already awake and alert.Good morning, he whispered.Good morning, she said.How long have you been up?About an hour.Why didnt you go back to sleep?I wasnt tired.And besides, I kind of enjoyed watching you.That has the potential to sound very creepy, you know.Okay.She smiled.Well, since you were watching me, I hope I didnt do anything embarrassing or make any strange noises.You didnt.You just lay there looking sexy as hell.My hair is messy and I need to brush my teeth.Right now?Why?What did you have in mind?He reached toward her, using his finger to trace her collarbone, and after that, no words were necessary.Later, they showered together and dressed.Maria dried her hair and put on makeup while Colin leaned against the bathroom counter beside her, nursing a cup of coffee.Are we going someplace?he asked.Brunch.With my parents.Sounds good.Im going to need to change first, though.What time?Eleven.I take it that we wont be riding together.Thats probably not a good idea.Its going to be hard enough to prepare them for your visit.Because this time, theyre going to ask a lot of questions.Okay.Maria put down her mascara wand and took his hand.Does that bother you?Or scare you?No.Well, it sure scares me, she admitted, returning to her makeup.The whole thing is terrifying, in fact.He took a sip of coffee.What are you going to tell them about me?Hopefully, as little as possible.Any details will just spur more questions that you should answer, not me.What are you hoping for today?For my mom to get through it without tears, and my father not to demand that you leave the house.Thats not a very high bar.Trust me, she said.Its higher than you think.CHAPTER 13      Colin      C  olin pulled up to Marias parents house just before eleven.He had no idea how the conversation with her parents had gone, and as he stepped out of the car, he figured there was no use in speculating, since hed find out soon enough anyway.Had Lily been around, he would have asked her what he should bring to a family brunch, but she and Evan were already at church when he got home, and in the end, it probably wouldnt do much good anyway.Like everyone else, they were going to form their own opinions, and a basket of muffins wasnt going to alter them.Still, as he walked to the door, he hoped that Maria was all right.Earlier, on his way home, hed thought about her virtually nonstop, one series of images giving way to the next, each more ravishing than the one before.That was a first for him, she was a first, and he took a deep breath, reminding himself that even though he wouldnt shy away from any questions, his answers could be framed in a lot of different ways and still remain honest.He knocked at the door and it swung open almost immediately, revealing Serena.He noticed again how much she resembled her older sister, though she seemed even more high strung than usual, which probably wasnt a good sign.Hey, Colin, she said, stepping aside to let him in.I saw you walking up.Come on in.Thank you.How did your dinner go last night?Awesome, she answered.But I should be the one asking you.We had a good time.Im sure.Serena winked.Marias in the kitchen with Mom, she said, closing the door behind him.And Im amazed you were able to get her to go dancing.Why?If you dont know yet, I think you need to spend even more time with her, she answered.But heres a word to the wise  I wouldnt get too descriptive about last night, especially anything that might have happened after the dancing.Its already a little tense around here.I have a hunch that my parents think youre a terrorist.Okay.I might be exaggerating, but who really knows?she babbled.I didnt get here until the three of them were finished talking, and my parents barely said hello to me.All I really know for sure is that my dad wasnt smiling and my mom kept making the sign of the cross, despite how well last nights dinner with the director of the foundation went not that my little challenges matter right now.Anyway, I decided it was best if I just waited for you in the living room.By then, theyd reached the kitchen, where he saw Maria standing over a sizzling frying pan while her mom pulled a small baking pan from the oven.The air smelled of bacon and cinnamon.Colins here, Serena called out.Maria turned and he noticed she was wearing an apron.Hi, Colin, she said tightly.You remember my mom, right?Carmen forced on a plastic smile, and though Colin might have been imagining it, she seemed paler than shed been just a couple of days earlier.Good morning, Mrs.Sanchez, he said, figuring a bit of formality was probably a good bet.Good morning.She nodded and, obviously uncomfortable, turned her attention back to the pan as she placed it on an iron rack on the counter.Serena leaned toward him.My mom decided to do an American breakfast just for you, she whispered.Bacon and eggs, French toast, cinnamon rolls.Of course, that was before Maria told her about you.Maria pulled a couple of strips of bacon from the pan and set them on a napkin covered plate off to the side of the stove.Hey, Serena?Can you take over for a second?Be glad to, Serena chirped.But only if I get to wear the cool apron.Maria started toward them, slipping off the apron as she walked and passing it to Serena like trading places was normal.In this kitchen, Colin assumed it was.Serena started chatting away with her mother in Spanish as she donned the apron.Up close, Colin noticed tension in the way Maria was moving.She gave him a quick peck on the cheek, careful to keep a bit of distance between them.Any trouble finding the place?Google, he answered.Glancing over his shoulder, it was hard not to notice the way Carmen frowned slightly.He knew enough not to ask how it had gone earlier; instead, he defaulted to silence.Maria lowered her voice, concern etched on her face.Would you mind talking to my dad before we eat?Okay.And, um She trailed off.Its your father, he said.I wont forget.She nodded, the movement almost imperceptible.Im going to stay in here and help my mom in the kitchen, she said.My dads at the table on the back porch.Do you want any coffee?Im fine, Colin replied.Water?Im fine, he said again.Okay She took a step backward.I guess I better get back to the kitchen, then.Colin watched as she backed away, past a refrigerator decorated with dozens of photos, letters, and other keepsakes, before she turned around.He moved toward the slider and as soon as he opened the door, Felix turned his way.There was less anger than hed anticipated, though the shock and disappointment were evident, as was his obvious antagonism.In his lap, a small white dog was sleeping.Colin closed the door behind him and walked toward Felix, his eyes steady.Nearing the table, he offered his hand.Good morning, Mr.Sanchez.Maria said you wanted to speak with me.Felix looked toward the hand before he reluctantly offered his own.Colin stood, waiting for Felix to invite him to sit at the table.Eventually Felix nodded toward a chair, and Colin sat.He clasped his hands and rested them in front of him, remaining quiet.There was no point in trying to make small talk or pretending that he didnt know what Felix wanted to discuss.Felix was in no rush to speak and took his time scrutinizing him.Maria said that you were in trouble with the law, he finally began.Is that true?Yes, Colin answered.Over the next half hour, the full story came out in bits and pieces, much as it had with Maria that first night on the beach.He didnt sugarcoat his past or attempt to mislead Felix; he was who he was.Like with Maria, Felixs shock was pronounced at times and he pressed for further clarification; when Colin eventually recounted what happened at the first military school hed attended, Colin thought he saw a flash of sudden understanding.By the time he finished, Felix was less on edge than he had been when Colin had first joined him on the porch, but it was also clear that he needed time to think about all that hed learned.No surprise there.Felix was a father and Maria was his daughter, and there was only so far he would go.You claim that youve changed and I would like to believe you, but Im not sure that I do.Okay.Colin nodded.What if you get arrested again?I dont plan on it.Thats the problem.People seldom plan on it.Colin said nothing.There was really nothing to say.Felix continued to pet the little white dog.If you do get arrested, what will happen?I wont see her.Ill end it.The worst thing would be for her to think she should wait.After a moment, Felix offered a slight nod, satisfied but still unsure as to whether he believed it.If you ever hurt my daughter or put my daughter in danger  He didnt finish, but he didnt need to.Colin knew what Felix wanted to hear, and because it was true, he had no trouble saying it.It wont happen.I have your word.Yes.Just then, Maria popped her head out, clearly nervous but also relieved that she hadnt heard any shouting.Are you two about finished?Brunch is ready.Felix exhaled.Were done, he said.Lets eat.After theyd finished eating, Serena and her parents began to clean up while Maria lingered behind with Colin.What did you say to him?Maria asked.The truth, Colin answered.All of it?Yes.Maria appeared flummoxed.Then it went a lot better than I thought it would.Maria was right  the brunch had been relatively pleasant, with Serena chattering on about the scholarship, Steve, and the escapades of her numerous friends.Felix and Carmen had occasionally asked questions, even lobbing a few queries toward Colin, though all were about work or school.When hed mentioned MMA, he thought that Carmen had paled just a bit.Still Maria said.I guess you were right.It was best to get it all out there in the beginning.Sometimes, Colin thought.Not always.Felix had been cordial, but there wasnt any fondness or trust evident, both of which would take time to achieve, if that was possible at all.He didnt say that, though.Instead, he reached for the door.Do you want to do some paddleboarding later?he asked.How about we do something different instead.Like Jet Skiing.We can rent them at the beach.Does that sound fun?He recalled the sight of her in a bikini again.Actually, that sounds great.They met at Wrightsville Beach later that afternoon and spent a couple of hours on Jet Skis before Colin returned home to squeeze in a quick workout.They cooked dinner at Marias and then, like the night before, spent the next few hours wrapped in each others arms.Monday morning came too soon, but that week they spent as much time together as they could.Colin met Maria for lunch twice, and on Wednesday, she spent the evening at Crabby Petes, nursing a Diet Pepsi and working on a legal brief for Barney with her MacBook propped on the bar in front of her.Aside from his shifts and classes, a few hours for working out, and family brunch, they were together almost every minute, and went to both the farmers market and the aquarium, neither of which Colin had ever contemplated visiting before.Through it all, he simply tried to embrace the way he felt about her.He didnt think about it, didnt worry about it, didnt try to understand it.Instead, he enjoyed the way he felt whenever she laughed, and how sexy she was when she knit her eyebrows in concentration; he savored the feel of her hand in his as they walked and talked, their conversations drifting from the serious to the silly.On Sunday night, in bed after making love, Maria was lying on her stomach, her knees bent and feet up as she nibbled on some grapes.Colin found it impossible to take his eyes from her, ogling her until she playfully tossed a grape at him.Stop staring.Youre making me feel self conscious.He reached for the grape and popped it in his mouth.Why?Because Im Catholic and were not married, maybe?He chuckled.Your mother asked if I was Catholic, didnt she?When we were at lunch the first time?You understand Spanish?Not really.I took it in high school and barely passed, but I heard my name and the word catlico when she was at the table.It wasnt that hard to translate.But yes, he continued.I was raised Catholic.I was baptized and confirmed, the whole nine yards.But I pretty much stopped going to church after I got sent off to school, so Im not sure what that makes me now.Shell still be happy.Good.How did they get you confirmed if you stopped going to church?Donations, I guess.Probably a big one, because the priest let me do a cram course one summer and even though I didnt do any of the work, the next year, they let me get confirmed anyway.Thats kind of cheating.Its not kind of cheating.It is cheating.On the plus side, I got a go kart out of it, so that was kind of nice.A go kart?It was either that or I wouldnt do it.For all the good it did me.I totaled it within a couple of weeks and refused to talk to my parents the rest of the summer because they wouldnt buy me a new one.Nice, she said sarcastically.Ive never hidden the fact that I have issues.Im aware.She smiled.But sometimes, I wish youd surprise me in a good way when you talk about your younger years.He thought about it.I beat up my older sisters ex boyfriend once.Does that count?Since he was a total jerk?No, she said, that doesnt count.He smiled.Do you want to have lunch tomorrow?Id love to, but I already promised Jill.She texted me earlier and I forgot to mention it.Im open to a late dinner, though.I cant, he said.I have to work.You mean we might not see each other tomorrow?Whatever am I going to do?It might have been the playfulness in her tone or the fact that a long and wonderful weekend was finally coming to an end, but he didnt respond.Instead, he just stared at her, noting the sensual curves of her body, perfect in nearly every way.You are incredibly beautiful, he whispered.A light smile played across her lips, seductive and lovely.Yeah?Yeah, he echoed, and as he continued to gaze at her, he couldnt shake the feeling that a long journey was finally coming to an end.He knew what that meant, and while the feeling had been unimaginable even a month ago, there was no reason to deny it.He reached toward her, gently running his fingers through her hair, the sensation luxurious, and he let out a long breath.I love you, Maria, he finally murmured.He watched as her surprise gave way to comprehension.With his hand still in her hair, she wrapped it in hers.Oh, Colin, she whispered, I love you, too.CHAPTER 14      Maria      T  hey made love early the following morning; afterward, Colin told her he wanted to get a workout in before class, and though the sun had not yet risen when he left, Maria tossed and turned, unable to fall back to sleep.She finally got out of bed, resolved to catch up on some long neglected work.She brewed coffee, showered, and dressed, and with the best of intentions opened up her MacBook to get some work done in the hour and a half before she left for the office.And yet, as she settled in, she couldnt escape a growing, though inchoate, sense that something was wrong.Even as she sifted through her feelings, she couldnt pinpoint the cause.The timing made her suspect that it had something to do with Colin; the relationship had been a bit of a whirlwind, although she certainly didnt regret it.Theyd fallen in love, and there was nothing wrong with that.It was normal.It happened to other people every day.And considering all the time theyd spent getting to know each other, it wasnt even all that unexpected.So what on earth was bothering her?Refilling her cup, she abandoned the table and wandered to the balcony, watching as the port city slowly came to life.A light mist lingered just above the sidewalk, making it appear almost out of focus.As she sipped her coffee, she remembered standing in the same spot the night they had first made love, and though it brought a smile to her face, the memory was accompanied by a definite pang of anxiety.Okay, so maybe her feelings about Colin werent as simple and straightforward as she wanted to pretend.But what, exactly, was throwing her off?That they were sleeping together?The words theyd spoken to each other last night?The fact that her parents didnt approve of him?Or that a month ago, she couldnt have even imagined falling for someone like him?That pretty much sums it up, she admitted.But why this anxiety this morning?It was ridiculous to think that simply saying I love you could upset her equilibrium this way.Logically, it made no sense.She finished her coffee and decided to head in to work early, sure that she was blowing the whole thing out of proportion.And yet, throughout the morning, the feeling didnt dissipate; if anything, it only grew more pronounced.By ten, even her stomach had grown slightly upset.The more she tried to convince herself that worrying about Colin didnt make sense, the more difficult she found it to concentrate.As the clock clicked toward the lunch hour, all she could think was that she needed to talk to Jill.Maria went through all of it, including the way she was feeling, as she watched Jill pull several pieces of sushi from the platter onto her plate and begin wolfing them down.For her part, Maria put a single piece on her plate before realizing there wasnt a chance she could force it down.By the time she finished speaking, Jill was nodding.So let me get this straight, Jill said.You met a guy, the two of you slept together after not dating all that long, you introduced him to your parents and they didnt run for the hills, and he told you that he loved you.And then, this morning, you suddenly began questioning everything.Have I summed that up correctly?Pretty much.And youre not sure why?Maria made a face.Humor me.Its simple.Youre just going through a grown up version of the walk of shame.Excuse me?The walk of shame?From college?After you had too much to drink at a party and you hooked up with a guy that you thought was perfect and then, when morning came around, you couldnt believe what had just happened?And then walked back across the campus to your place wondering what the hell you were doing, still dressed in what youd been wearing the night before?I know what the walk of shame is.And its not anything like that.Jill used her chopsticks to pick up the last remaining maki roll.Maybe not specifically, but Id be surprised if your emotions werent seesawing from one extreme to the other, which is what most girls go through during the walk of shame.As in, Did that really happen?Was it as good as I remember?What did I do?Falling in love is terrifying.Thats why they say falling in love and not something like floating toward love.Falling is scary.Floating is kind of dreamy.She shook her head sorrowfully at Marias plate.I just ate all of our food and Im going to blame you when I get on the scale.In other words, you think that what Im going through is normal?Id be way more worried if you werent questioning everything.Because then, it would mean youre crazy.Did this happen with Paul?When you first fell in love with him?Of course.One day, hed be all I could think about, and the next, Id wonder whether I was making the biggest mistake of my life.And heres a little secret  sometimes it still happens.I know I love him, but Im not sure I love him enough to date him forever.I want to get married and have children.Or at least one.And by the way?His parents dont like me that much, and I struggle with that, too.Why dont they like you?They think I talk too much.And that Im too opinionated.Youre kidding.I know, right?Maria laughed before growing serious again.I think its hard because everything about Colin and me just seems so foreign.With Luis, it all made sense.We were friends first, and even after we were dating, it must have been six months before I told him that I loved him.My parents liked him, and he came from a good family, and there was nothing about his past to even question.If memory serves, I believe you also told me that Serena didnt like Luis at all.And in the end, he turned out to be a selfish jerk.Oh yeah.That.But  Luis was your first love.You cant compare what happened then with whats happening now.Thats what I just said.Youre missing my point.My point is that first loves always make sense because you dont know any better.Everything is a first and any warning bells are drowned out by the sheer novelty of it all.In the beginning, anyway.Now youre older and wiser, and you need someone in your life whos older and wiser, too.You want someone who doesnt play games, and with Colin, what you see is what you get.You trust him and you enjoy spending time with him.Or at least, thats what youve been telling me.And you dont think its moving too fast?Compared to what?Its your life.My advice is to go with the flow and take it one day at a time.And again, what youre feeling today is perfectly normal.Id rather not feel this way at all.Who would?But I have a hunch that youll feel better as soon as you talk to him again.Thats the way it usually works.Maria pushed her lonely piece of sushi around, finally beginning to feel the first pangs of hunger.I hope youre right.Of course Im right.Love makes everything complicated, and emotions always go wild in the beginning.But when its real, you should hold on tight, because were both old enough to know that true love doesnt come along all that often.After lunch with Jill, Maria did feel better.Maybe not entirely normal, but at the very least somewhat centered again.The more she thought about it, the more she recognized that Jill had been right about pretty much everything.Falling in love was a little frightening and enough to make anyone a bit screwy in the beginning.It had been so long that shed forgotten what it was supposed to feel like.Jill had also been spot on when shed assured Maria that talking to Colin would help settle her doubts.He called a little after four while he was on his way to work.Although they didnt chat for long, simply hearing his voice seemed to diminish the tension in her neck and shoulders.And when he asked if she was free the following evening and whether they could spend time together, she realized how much she wanted exactly that.The thought of spending time with Colin after work made the following day pass more quickly than usual.Even Barney  who either dropped by her office or called a dozen times to get the latest updates on various matters  couldnt shake her good spirits.When the phone rang halfway through the afternoon, she answered automatically, expecting to hear Barneys voice, only to hear Jill on the other end.Now hes just showing off, her friend announced.It took a second to identify the voice.Jill?So either the two of you got into a fight last night and hes hoping for forgiveness, or hes trying to make other men look bad.What are you talking about?Colin.And the bouquet of roses he just sent you.He sent roses?What did you think I was talking about?The delivery guy is waiting for you.Maria glanced at her phone, noting the extension.Why are you calling from Gwens phone in the lobby?Because I happened to be talking to Gwen when the delivery guy walked in, and I insisted that I be allowed to call you because this is getting ridiculous.Do you know how often Paul has sent me roses at work?Try never.And if you dont get out here soon, I might take the bouquet and stomp on it because its making me question my entire relationship again.And believe me  you dont want that on your conscience.Maria laughed.No stomping, okay?Ill be right there.When she entered the lobby, she spotted Jill standing beside a deliveryman in a baseball cap who was, sure enough, holding a bouquet of pink roses.Before she could thank him, the delivery guy handed the bouquet to her and abruptly turned away.A moment later, the lobby door was closing behind him, almost like hed never been there at all.Charming fellow, Jill commented.He couldnt even make small talk.He just kept saying your name whenever I asked a question.But you have to admit the bouquet is gorgeous.Maria had to agree.The buds, enveloped in sprigs of babys breath, were either closed or just barely beginning to wink open, and as she bent to smell them, she realized that the florist had been thoughtful enough to trim the thorns.I cant believe he would do this, she remarked, inhaling the bouquets delicate scent.Its almost sad, Jill said, shaking her head.He must have serious self esteem issues.Since hes always seeking your approval, I mean.I dont think Colin has self esteem issues.Then he must be needy.You should probably break up with him before it gets any worse.You need someone like Paul, a guy who thinks first and foremost about himself.Maria peered up at her friend.Are you finished?Did you get the sense that Im envious?Yes.Then yes.Im finished.And I take it that the two of you talked and all is well again?We made plans for tonight, in fact.She held out the bouquet toward Jill.Would you mind holding this while I open the card?Why not?Its not like youre trying to rub it in.Maria rolled her eyes as she slid the card out and read it.She blinked before reading it a second time, her brow beginning to crease.What is it?Jill asked.I wonder if they attached the wrong card.This one doesnt make sense.What does it say?Maria held it open to show Jill.It says, she read, You will know how it feels.Jill wrinkled her nose.Is that a private joke or something?No.Then what is it supposed to mean?I have no idea, Maria answered, growing more puzzled by the minute.Jill handed back the bouquet.Its a strange thing to write, dont you think?Definitely strange, Maria conceded.Maybe you should call him and ask about what he meant.Maybe, Maria thought.Hes probably at the gym.So what?Ill bet he has his phone with him.Or you know what it could be?Maybe the florist made a mistake.He either attached the wrong card or wrote it down wrong.I guess thats possible, Maria agreed, and though she tried to convince herself it was true, she wondered whether either of them really believed it.After putting the roses in the vase from the first bouquet of flowers, Maria continued to examine the card until finally deciding, Oh, what the hell?Pulling her cell phone from her purse, she rang Colin.Hey there, he said.Youre not calling to cancel on me tonight, are you?He was breathing hard, and in the background, Maria could hear music and the sound of people running on the treadmill.No.Im looking forward to it.Did I catch you at a bad time?Not at all.Whats up?Just a quick question.I wanted to ask you about your message.What message?On the card that came with the roses today.The card said, You will know how it feels, and Im not sure what you meant by that.She could hear him breathing on the other end.It wasnt me.I didnt send you roses today.Or a card.Maria felt a sudden prickle on the back of her neck.You will know how it feels?It was weird enough if Colin had written it, but if it wasnt from him, that made the note  Strange.Even creepy.Whats it supposed to mean?Colin said into the silence.I dont know.Im still trying to figure it out.And you dont know who they came from?There was no name on the card.Colin said nothing to that, and trying to hide her own feeling of unease, she changed the subject.I know youve got to get back to your workout  and I should get back to work  but what time will you be coming by tonight?How about six thirty?I was thinking that we head down to the Riverwalk and play it by ear.Im kind of in the mood to move, not just sit.And we can grab a bite while were there.Sounds perfect.Ive been planted in my chair the last couple of days, and a walk is just what I need.As they hung up, she was picturing the way he looked in the gym but then she caught sight of the roses again, as well as the card.The card with no name.You will know how it feels.She examined the card again, wondering if shed be able to call the florist and find out who ordered them, only to realize that neither the envelope nor the card bore any markings whatsoever.Youre distracted, Colin said as they walked hand in hand on the Riverwalk, the popular promenade along the Cape Fear River.Because it was midweek, the streets werent crowded, and though it was still warm, the northerly breeze hinted at the possibility of cooler temperatures in the weeks ahead.For the first time in months, she was glad she was wearing jeans.She shook her head.Im just trying to figure out who would have sent me the roses.Maybe you have a secret admirer.Aside from you, I havent met anyone new lately.Its not as though I go out much, either.Im either visiting my parents, paddleboarding, or at my place.Except when youre at work.No one at work would have sent them, she responded, but even as she said the words, Kens image popped into her head.He wouldnt do that, would he?Besides, the message doesnt really reflect someones attempt to make me feel special.It does just the opposite, in fact.What about a client?I guess its possible, she conceded, but she had trouble believing it.Colin squeezed her hand.One way or the other, youll find out who he is.You think its a he?Dont you?She nodded, absolutely sure of it, though there was no real indication.The message bothers me.She hoped that hed say something to make her feel better.Instead, he took a few steps before glancing at her.It bothers me, too.Spending time with Colin somehow lessened her unease.Or at least it prevented her from dwelling on who might have sent the flowers and written the note.She didnt have the faintest clue who it might be, other than Ken, and while there was much to dislike about the man, she couldnt imagine him doing something like that.As she and Colin walked, the conversation drifted from one topic to another.Eventually they stopped for ice cream cones, Colin surprising her by ordering one as well.They ate them as they stood at the railing that offered a view of the USS North Carolina, a battleship that had engaged in extensive action in World War II and had been formally retired, now docked on the other side of the Cape Fear River.She remembered touring it once on a field trip, recalling how cramped it was belowdecks, the claustrophobic feeling of the narrow corridors and tiny rooms.She wondered how sailors had managed to stay on board for months at a time without losing their minds.They traversed the length of the Riverwalk while the setting sun slowly turned the river to gold, then leisurely browsed through whatever shops caught their interest.By the time the moon had begun to glow over the horizon, they finally stopped for dinner, and as she sat across the table from Colin, she found herself hoping that her parents would get to know this side of him, the one that made her feel comfortable and at ease.She wanted them to witness how happy she was when she was with him.On their way back to her condo, she invited Colin to brunch again, even if she wasnt sure her parents were ready for another visit.When they made love that night, it was slow and tender, a deliberate dance as he moved above her, whispering her name and how much she meant to him.She gave herself over to him completely, lost in the moment and lost in him.In the afterglow, she fell asleep with her head on his chest, lulled by the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.She woke up twice  once a little after midnight and the second time an hour before dawn  and in the stillness of those moments she stared at him, still amazed that theyd become a couple and more certain than ever that each of them was exactly what the other needed.When she entered her office Wednesday morning, her first thought was that she needed to get rid of the card.She tore it into pieces and dropped them into the wastebasket, then pulled up to her office computer.Reviewing her messages, she checked whether any of her clients had mentioned sending the flowers, but found nothing.Meanwhile, Barney was waiting for her in the conference room, and it wasnt until nearly noon that she finally got back to her office.In her inbox she found yet another file that Barney had e mailed, accompanied by a message suggesting she get a jump start on it since he needed a summary by tomorrow.Which meant takeout lunch at her desk again.Glancing over at the roses, she realized she didnt want them in her office.Grabbing the bouquet and her purse, she left the building, rounding the corner toward the garbage bins.She heaved the bouquet into the Dumpster, and was starting toward her car when she had the sudden sense that someone was watching her.Spotting no one in her vicinity, she dismissed the feeling at first.But it grew stronger, and as she began fishing through her purse for her car keys, she glanced toward the building.There, standing at his office window, was Ken.She dropped her gaze toward her purse again, pretending she hadnt noticed him.What was he doing and how long had he been standing there?For all she knew, there was someone else in his office and he was standing near the window with his back to them, but if he had been at the window when shed walked out, hed no doubt seen her throwing away the roses.And that wasnt good.If hed sent them, he was probably going to be angry; if he hadnt, he might assume that she and Colin were on the outs.Either way, she worried that Ken just might feel the urge to drop by her office again for further discussions on whether she was really a team player.Pulling open her car door, she was hit by a blast of heat from the sun cooked interior, and as soon as she turned on the engine, she turned on the air conditioner.She decided to drive to the organic market, which had an amazing salad bar, and as she exited the parking lot, she checked her rearview mirror, assuming Ken would be gone.But he hadnt left the window.And though he was too far away for her to know for sure, she couldnt escape the feeling that hed been watching her all along.Returning from the store, she parked in the same spot shed vacated, deciding to leave the windows cracked to cool the interior.Kens car was already gone, and if history was any indication, he wouldnt be back until one thirty or so.Relieved, she tried to settle into work.Between the roses, the message, and now Ken, she felt ready to collect her things and go home.Maybe she could feign a migraine and leave early but what was the point?Barney would still expect her to complete the work, and even at home, she knew shed continue to obsess over the days events.You will know how it feels.How what feels?Because shed rejected Kens advances, was he planning to make her work life even more miserable?If so, what would that mean?She tried to force the questions away while putting together a time line relating to a customer whod been injured in a fall and was suing a department store.It would take most of the afternoon, and as she began to jot down notes, she observed that her entire profession was part of a giant game in which the object was to amass billable hours, making attorneys the only guaranteed winners.It was a cynical view, but how else could she explain how she was always so busy despite the fact that justice was anything but swift?She was still working on cases that had been initially filed years ago, and the case Barney had just assigned her had no chance of reaching the courtroom for at least eighteen months.And thats if things went smoothly, which was virtually impossible, since things never went smoothly.So why did Barney need the time line by tomorrow?What was so urgent?At the back of her mind, she kept picturing Ken as hed watched her.She wasnt going to let him blindside her again if he dropped by to supposedly discuss her career.She decided to keep her office door wide open even though the ambient office noise tended to distract her.That way, if Ken did decide to pay her a visit, shed have a few extra seconds to prepare.From her window, it was possible to see Kens parking spot.Predictably, the man drove a red Corvette, and at one thirty on the dot, he pulled in.She half expected him to drop by as soon as he entered the building, but to her relief, he didnt appear.Nor did he swing by later, even to visit the paralegals.When he remained a no show at five, she reminded herself not to stay late.She closed down her MacBook and gathered paper copies of her files, loading it all into her bag.Peeking out the window, she did a quick double take when she realized that Kens car was already gone for the day.Whatever.Tomorrow would likely bring more surprises.Leaving her office, she said good bye to Jill and headed for her car.As always, she went around to the passenger side door first so she could put her bag on the seat, but as soon as she pulled it open, she let out an inadvertent cry.The bouquet of roses, already shriveling in the heat, was fanned neatly across the seat, as if trying to taunt her.Colin sat across from her in her living room, his elbows on his knees.Maria had called him right after throwing the roses back into the Dumpster, and hed been waiting at her door when she got home.I dont get it, she said, still feeling flushed and panicky.What does Ken want?You know what he wants.And he thinks this is the best way to get it?By sending me flowers and a weird unsigned note?And by stuffing the roses back in my car and freaking me out?I cant answer that, Colin said.I think the real question is what youre going to do about it.He continued to hold her gaze, unmoving, but the tensing of his jaw made it clear that he was as disturbed by the whole thing as she was.I dont know that theres anything I can do.The note was unsigned and I didnt actually watch him put the roses in my car.I cant prove any of it.And youre positive it was Ken?Who else could it be?There was no one else around.Are you sure?She opened her mouth to reply but quickly closed it because she hadnt even considered the alternative.Just because she hadnt seen anyone else didnt mean there actually had been no one else, but the idea was too frightening to contemplate.Its him, she said.It has to be him.But even to her own ears, it almost sounded like she was trying to convince herself.CHAPTER 15      Colin      C  olin spent the night with Maria.Though she hadnt asked him to stay, hed known that she hadnt wanted him to leave.Shed been on edge most of the evening, unable to eat, and he could sense her mind drifting off.After shed finally fallen asleep, he lay awake staring at the ceiling, trying to put the pieces together.Shed told him enough about Ken to give Colin a pretty good picture, and hed been fighting the urge ever since to pay the man a visit.The sexual harassment was bad enough, but Ken was a bully as well, and Colin knew from his own experience that people like that didnt stop abusing their power unless someone made them.Or put the fear of God into them.However, Maria had made it clear that she didnt want Colin to talk to Ken or even go anywhere near him, if only for Colins own good.Colin understood that: The man was a well known lawyer, and even a credible threat might be enough to put Colin behind bars.He had no doubt that Margolis and the local judges would make sure of that.Still, the situation had felt more confusing the more theyd talked about it.The note, combined with the fact that the roses had been placed in her car, felt like a threat.It felt personal, and while Ken had trouble controlling his libido and had been standing at the window, the rest of it didnt add up.What was the point of the note?How had Ken known Maria would decide to throw the roses away at that moment?Or if Ken had planned to put them in the car, why had he continued to stand in the window, knowing that Maria would no doubt assume he was guilty?He had to know that scaring Maria would make it more likely that shed report his harassment.And what if another employee in the office had noticed him retrieving the roses from the garbage and placing them in Marias car?Would he have been willing to take that kind of risk?Most of the offices had windows.All of which meant what?If Ken had done it, hed slipped off the mental building ledge and was plummeting toward the ground, obviously unable to think clearly.And if it wasnt Ken?That was the question that bothered him most.When Maria woke in the morning, Colin offered to follow her in to work, but she told him that shed be fine.It wasnt until he was driving back to Evans that he realized he was as edgy about the whole thing as shed been the night before.Angry, even, and as soon as he got home, he tossed on his workout gear and was out the door.He went for a run and put the music volume on high, picking up his pace until his breathing grew labored.When he finally felt drained of his anger, he experienced a slowly emerging clarity.Hed do what Maria asked and stay away from Ken, but that didnt mean that he was willing to sit back and do nothing.No one was going to frighten Maria and get away with it.Have either of you considered calling the police?Evan asked.They were at the table in Evans kitchen, a few minutes after Colin had offered Evan the CliffsNotes version of all that had happened, including what he planned to do.Colin shook his head.The police wont do anything.But someone broke into her car.Her car was unlocked, the windows were open, nothing was taken, and there was no damage.The first thing theyll ask is, whats the crime?And then theyll ask who did it, and all shell be able to offer is her opinions.What about the message?Arent there stalking laws?The note is weird, but theres no clear threat.And theres no proof that the person who sent the flowers was the same person who put them in her car.I sometimes forget that youve had a lot of experience in this area.But Im still not sure why you think you need to take care of it.I dont need to do it.I want to.And what if Maria doesnt like your plan?When Colin didnt answer, Evan waved a hand.Because you plan on telling her, right?Since youre all about honesty?Its not that big of a deal.You didnt answer my question.Yes, Ill tell her.When?Today.And if she asks you not to?When Colin didnt answer, Evan sat up straighter.Youll do it anyway.Because youve already made your decision, am I correct?I want to know whats going on.You do know that this is what youve done in the past, right?Do whatever the hell you want, your future be damned?Im making phone calls.Ill talk to people.Colin shrugged.Its not illegal.No argument there.But Im talking about what you might decide to do afterwards.I know what Im doing.Do you?When Colin didnt respond right away, Evan leaned back in his seat.Did I tell you that Lily wants the four of us to go out together this weekend?No.She was thinking Saturday night.She wants to meet Maria.Okay.Shouldnt you check with Maria first?Ill talk to her, but Im sure shell be fine with it.What are you thinking about doing?Dinner.And then afterwards, well find someplace fun.I think all those lessons put her in the mood to go dancing.Salsa dancing?She says I dont have the rhythm for it.Itll be some other kind of dancing.At a club?Since you obviously escaped without trouble last time, Lilys of the opinion that you can do it again.Okay.I have another question, though.Colin waited as Evan stared across the table at him.What happens if you do find the guy?Ill talk to him.Even if its her boss?When Colin didnt answer, Evan shook his head.I knew I was right.Right about what?You dont have the slightest idea what youre getting into.While Colin understood that Evan was worried, he didnt think his concern was justified.How hard could it be to figure out whether Ken sent the roses?All it would take was a few phone calls, some pointed questions, and a photo Lord knows hed been on the receiving end of countless interrogations, and he knew that getting answers was often about presence and expectation and sounding official.Most people wanted to talk; most people couldnt shut up, even when it was in their best interest.He figured that if he was lucky, hed have his answer by midafternoon.In the kitchen back at his place, he opened his computer and did a quick search for Ken Martenson.Not hard to find  the guy was even more connected than Colin expected  but there were fewer photos than hed thought there would be, and none were what he really wanted; too far away, too blurry.Even the photo on the firm website had to be at least ten years old  at the time, Ken had a goatee, which altered his appearance to a significant degree.Colin would have to take his own photo, he decided.Except he didnt have a high quality camera with a telephoto lens.He doubted whether Evan had a decent camera, either; Evan wouldnt have spent the money.The guy was tighter than a tick.But Maria had one.He called her cell and left a message asking if she was free for lunch.By the time she texted him back to see whether he could meet at half past noon, he was in class.But as he read her text, the professor droning on in the background, he realized that hed been holding more tension in his neck than hed noticed.He forced himself to take deep, steady breaths.You want to borrow my camera?They were seated on the outdoor patio of a small caf, waiting for their food to arrive.Though Colin hadnt eaten since the night before, he wasnt hungry.Yes.Colin nodded.Why?I need a photo of Ken.She blinked.Excuse me?The only way to know for sure who ordered the flowers is to find the florist.I can then show the florist the photo and ask if hes the one who bought them.What if he ordered by phone?If he paid with a credit card, Ill get the name.They wont give it to you.Maybe.Maybe not.Id still like to borrow your camera.Maria debated before shaking her head.No.Why not?For starters, hes my boss.He also knows what you look like, and if he sees you, its only going to get worse for me around there.Besides, I saw Ken this morning and I have the sense its already over.You saw him?He came to talk to Barney and me about one of our cases first thing in the morning.To let us know hed heard that it was finally on the docket.You didnt mention that when I called  I didnt know I had to.He caught the first hint of frustration creeping into her tone.How did he act?It was fine, she stated.He was normal.And you werent bothered when he showed up?Of course I was.My heart practically jumped out of my chest, but what could I do?Barney was right there.But Ken didnt try to talk to me alone, and he didnt spend any time with the paralegals, either.He was all business.Colin clasped his hands together beneath the table.With or without your camera, Im going to find out who sent you the flowers.I dont need you to solve my problems, Colin.I know.Then why are we still talking about this?Colin kept his expression steady.Because you still dont know with any certainty that Ken was the one who did it.Youre making an assumption.Its not an assumption.Would it be so wrong to make sure?There was a time, Colin knew, when he wouldnt have given a damn about any of this.There was no reason to get involved.She was right, after all.It was her problem, and frankly, he had enough problems of his own.However, Colin considered himself an expert in anger.And at its heart, thats what this was all about.At the hospital, hed learned the differences between overt and covert anger; in his own life, hed been well versed in both.At the bars, when he was in the mood to fight, his anger had been overt.His agenda was clear, with no hidden meanings, no shame, and no regret.In the first couple of weeks at the hospital, though, he hadnt been able to act out in any way if he became angry.The doctors had made it clear that if he became violent  if he so much as raised his voice  hed end up in the acute care ward, which meant being stuck in a communal room with a dozen other people, and mandatory lithium in doses that made him feel dull, while doctors and nurses watched his every move.That was the last thing he wanted.Instead, hed pushed his anger down, trying to keep it hidden, but after a while he realized that the anger didnt go away.Instead, it simply transformed from overt to covert.Subconsciously, he began to manipulate people; he sensed exactly what buttons needed to be pressed to piss someone off, and he jabbed at those buttons until they finally blew.One by one, others were sent to the acute care ward while he played innocent, until his doctor finally called him on what hed been doing.Countless hours of therapy later, Colin finally understood that anger was anger, whether overt or covert, and equally destructive either way.Thats what someone was acting out here, he thought.Anger with the intent to manipulate.Whoever it was wanted Marias emotions to start going haywire, and while it was covert for now, he sensed this was only the beginning.To Colins mind, that made Ken even less likely as a suspect, but then it was the only name he had.No choice but to start there.After Maria reluctantly handed him the key to her condo at the end of lunch, he drove to her place and retrieved the camera.He turned it on, making sure the batteries had enough juice, and ran through the various settings.Checked the zoom and took some shots off her balcony before realizing that he really needed to shoot faces to know how close hed have to be.After tucking the key into a planter pot near the door as instructed, he drove to the beach, where no one would think twice about a man with a camera.It wasnt crowded, but there were enough people around for him to get what he needed, and he spent an hour photographing people from various distances.In the end, he calculated that he could be no more than fifty yards away.Good, but not great.Ken might still be able to recognize him.Hed need a vantage point where he wouldnt be spotted.Most of the historical buildings on either side of the block where Marias office stood were two or three stories tall, with flat roofs.Cars lined both sides of the street, and though there were a few trees, none was big enough to hide behind.The foot traffic was not heavy but steady; remaining inconspicuous while hunkering down for an hour or more with a camera in hand was pretty much out of the question.Raising his gaze, he focused on the buildings hed just walked past, the ones opposite the office entrance.The distance was good and the angle was perfect, but it raised the question of how  or even if  he could get up there.He recrossed the street, hoping to find a fire escape.Modern two  to three story buildings didnt have them, and as soon as he reached the narrow alley that ran behind the block, he realized he was half lucky.The buildings directly opposite the law office had no roof access, but the three story building next to those had an old fashioned drop down ladder ten or eleven feet up that led to a metal landing on the second floor.Tough but not impossible to reach, and though the angle the building offered wasnt ideal, it was his best and only bet.Heading down the alley, he put the strap around his neck and tucked the camera beneath his shirt.He took a couple of explosive steps toward the wall, hoping to use it as a springboard to launch himself even higher and gain the last few inches he knew hed need.He did it just right, grabbing on to the bottom rung with both hands.With a hard jerk upward, he got one hand on the next rung up, repeating the process until he reached the landing.Thankfully, the ladder was attached to the building above that, and a few moments later, he was on the roof.Down on the street, no one appeared to have noticed him.So far, so good.He made his way to the corner closest to Marias office.The lip of the roof was low  no more than six inches  but some cover was better than none.Thankfully the gravel was smooth here; there were no big pebbles, though these were scattered everywhere else.There were a bunch of gum wrappers though, and as he got into position on his stomach, he brushed those away.He aimed the camera and settled in to wait.To his surprise, he could actually see Maria as she worked at her desk in her office; he could also make out her car and, beyond that, the garbage bins.Her car was parked in her usual spot, and a few spots down he saw Kens Corvette.A bit more than an hour later, the first people in the office began to stream out, usually one at a time, but sometimes in pairs.Paralegals  and yes, as Maria had mentioned, all of them were attractive  a couple of guys in their forties, Marias friend Jill.Several other people, followed a few minutes later by Maria.He followed her with the lens, thinking that she was moving more slowly than usual.When she reached the corner of the building, she glanced around, no doubt trying to find him.He watched her forehead form a frown before she finally headed to her car.Focusing on the entrance again, he still saw no sign of Ken.Just when he began to wonder whether the onset of dusk would blur the detail he wanted, Ken finally pushed through the door.Colin held his breath, snapped off a dozen photos before Ken turned into the parking lot, then rolled to his side to examine the images, hoping that one or two would be good enough.They were.He waited until Ken pulled away before getting up and making his way down from the roof the same way hed gone up.Again, no one appeared to notice him, and by the time he reached his car, dusk was settling in.He stopped at a drugstore on the way home and selected two of the photos for processing before heading back to Marias.Hed promised to bring her camera back.No wonder I couldnt find you, she said to him later, the photos on her kitchen table.So tomorrow  Ill start calling florists.And hopefully find out the truth.And if it was a phone order?Ill tell them the truth.That you were wondering whether the wrong card was attached to the delivery.And that youre wondering who theyre from.They might not tell you.Im just asking for a name, not the number.Id bet that most people would be willing to help.And when you find out that it was Ken?It was the same question that Evan had asked him earlier, and hed pondered it on and off since then.The decision as to what to do next would be yours.She nodded, tight lipped, before finally standing from the table and moving to the balcony doors.She stood before them, saying nothing for a long moment.Colin rose from his seat.When he was close, he put a hand on her lower back and felt something collapse beneath his touch.Im just so tired of talking about it.Im tired of even thinking about it.Lets get out of here and go do something that will take your mind off it.Like what?How about I surprise you?Staring out the window of the Camaro as it sat between a couple of minivans, she made no move to get out of the car.This is your surprise?I thought it might be fun.Mini golf?Seriously?Maria eyed with obvious skepticism the cheery lights that surrounded the entrance.Beyond the glass doors she could make out an arcade; off to the left was the miniature golf course, complete with rotating windmills as part of what Colin guessed was a Scandinavian theme.Not just mini golf.Its glow in the dark mini golf.And I take it that youve mistaken me for a twelve year old?Its a good distraction.And when was the last time you played?I just told you.When I was twelve.Kevin Ross had his birthday party here.But he pretty much invited the entire sixth grade and my mom came, too, so it wasnt exactly a date.But it was memorable.Afterwards, if you want, we can try the laser maze.Laser maze?I saw the banner a couple of months back when I was driving by.I think its like that scene in Get Smart with Steve Carell, where you have to try crossing a room without breaking the beams.When she didnt answer, he went on.Id hate to think youre just afraid I might win and thats what this is all about.Im not afraid of losing to you.If memory serves, I think I was the best in my class.Is that a yes?Youre on.Friday morning, Colin woke early and was out the door before dawn.He put in a quick six miles and visited the gym before going online and gathering the phone numbers he needed.Hed been surprised to learn that Wilmington had more than forty florists, in addition to grocery stores that also sold flowers, which meant hed be busy.He felt good about the night before.Though it took Maria a few holes and a couple of lucky putts before she began to relax, by the time theyd finished, she was laughing and even dancing on the green after she sank a hole in one on the sixteenth hole to pull ahead for good.Hungry, they skipped the laser maze and he brought her to a roadside stand near the beach that specialized in fish tacos, which they washed down with ice cold beer.He asked if shed be willing to go out with Evan and Lily  she told him of course  and when she kissed him good night, he could tell that the evening had been just what she needed.At the breakfast bar, he began making the first of his calls, hoping hed be able to knock out the list in a couple of hours, only to realize that the person he needed to talk to wasnt always immediately available, which meant a second or even third call to the same number.Still, he ran through the explanation and questions he thought might work best: that the wrong card might have been attached; had a delivery been sent to the office; had a bouquet of pink roses even been assembled; and fortunately, most of the people he spoke with had been more than willing to help.By the time he had called all but a handful of shops, it was early afternoon and hed begun to suspect that the last ones would say the same thing the others had said: that they hadnt been the florist who assembled or delivered the bouquet.He was right.Wondering what to do next, he decided to try some out of town florists; the only question was which direction to choose.He chose north.He called both florists in Hampstead, then found another eighteen in Jacksonville.On his sixth call, at a place named Floral Heaven near the gates of Camp Lejeune, he hit the jackpot.Yes, the owner told him, he remembered the man whod ordered the bouquet.It had been a cash order, he added.Yes, the store would be open tomorrow, and hed be there as well.Later that night, as he was tending bar, Colin found his thoughts returning to the fact that someone had gone to an awful lot of trouble to try to hide his identity.A thunderstorm rolled through on Friday night, bringing with it cooler temperatures.After finishing his run and doing some yard work on Saturday morning, Colin made the drive to Floral Heaven in Jacksonville, a little over an hour away.At the shop, Colin pulled out the photo of Ken and showed it to the man.This wouldnt happen to be the guy, would it?The owner, a portly man in his sixties with spectacles, took only a second before shaking his head.The man in the photo is a lot older.The guy who bought them was maybe in his late twenties, not that I had that great a look at him.No?He was kind of a strange guy, which is why I remember him at all.He wore a baseball hat and stared at the counter when he talked.Sort of mumbled.Just told me what he wanted and walked out the door.He came back an hour later, paid cash, and left.Did you happen to notice if he was alone?I wasnt paying attention, he answered.Whats this all about again?As I mentioned on the phone, there was a strange message written on the card.He didnt ask for a card.I remember that, too, because everyone always wants to write something.Like I said, he was a strange guy.Colins afternoon workout at the gym focused heavily on defensive work and grappling.Surprising him, Daly worked almost exclusively with him, pushing him harder than usual.In his day, Daly had been a beast when it came to ground work, and more than once, Colin found himself out of position, feeling like he was fighting for his life.By the time the workout ended, he realized that he hadnt thought about the guy in the baseball hat even once.Whoever he was.The preoccupation returned, however, as soon as he stepped out of the ring.Before he reached the locker room, Daly jogged over and pulled him aside.Can I talk to you for a couple of minutes?Colin used his still soaking shirt to wipe the sweat from his face.How would you feel about fighting next weekend?In Havelock.Before Colin could respond, Daly went on.I know youre three weeks out, but I got a call earlier from Bill Jensen.You know Bill, right?The promoter, Colin said.You know how much hes done for our fighters over the years including you  and hes in a bind.Anyway, Johnny Reese is headlining the event, and the guy he was supposed to fight broke his hand a few days ago and had to scratch.Reese needs a new opponent.As soon as Daly said the name, Colin remembered the conversation with Evan from the diner.The dude moves like a cat.Daly continued.Jensens been trying to find someone, and it turns out that youre the only guy in the weight class who actually might make it interesting.This is Reeses last fight before he goes pro, and hes got the goods.Former NCAA wrestling champ, getting better at striking, for the most part fearless.He actually has a shot at making it to the UFC in a year or two, which is why Jensen doesnt want to cancel.Thats why I went so hard with you today.I wanted to know if you were ready to take him on.Im not good enough for Reese.You had me on the defensive more than a few times today.Trust me, youre ready.Ill lose.Probably, Daly admitted.But itll be the best fight of his life to this point because youre better than you think you are.He twisted sweat from the bottom of his shirt.I know Im asking you to take a risk here, but it would help us out.You too.Jensens the kind of guy who never forgets a favor.And youd be helping us get some good publicity for my gym.Colin wiped his face again before deciding, Why the hell not?Okay, he said.When he left the gym, his mind was on Johnny Reese.Yet he found himself strangely unexcited, and by the time hed driven halfway home, he wasnt thinking about the upcoming fight at all.The only things on his mind were the man who had sent the roses and how someone other than Ken could have known Maria had thrown them away.Thats quite the day, Evan commented.They were on the porch, Colin drinking water and Evan nursing a beer.Reese, huh?Hes pretty good.
