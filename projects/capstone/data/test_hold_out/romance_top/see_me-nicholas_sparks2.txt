What was it this time?Fight at the Crazy Horse.When?When I was with you.Or driving or changing a tire.I might be your alibi this time?I doubt it.He knows it wasnt me or he would have brought me in and questioned me at the station.Then why the big show?Colin shrugged.It was a rhetorical question, since they both already knew the answer.Colin motioned toward his friend.Isnt that the tie Lily bought for your birthday?Evan looked down to examine it.It was paisley, a kaleidoscope of color.Yes it is, as a matter of fact.Good memory.What do you think?Too much?It doesnt matter what I think.But you dont like it.I think that if you want to wear it, you should wear it.Evan seemed momentarily undecided.Why do you do that?Do what?Refuse to answer a simple question.Because my opinion is irrelevant.You should wear what you want.Just tell me, okay?I dont like your tie.Really?Why not?Because its ugly.Its not ugly.Colin nodded.Okay.You dont know what youre talking about.Probably.You dont even wear ties.Youre right.So why do I care what you think?I dont know.Evan scowled.Talking to you can be infuriating, you know.I know.Youve said that before.Of course Ive said it before!Because its true!Didnt we just talk about this the other night?You dont have to say whatever pops into your head.But you asked.Just Oh, forget it.He turned and started back toward the house.Ill talk to you later, okay?Where are you going?Evan walked a couple of steps before answering without turning around.To change my damn tie.And by the way, Margolis was right.Your face still looks like it was run through a meat grinder.Colin smiled.Hey, Evan!Evan stopped and turned.What?Thanks.For what?For everything.Yeah, yeah.Youre just lucky I wont tell Lily what you said.You can if youd like.I already told her.Evan stared.Of course you did.In class, Colin sat in the third row, taking notes and trying to concentrate on what the teacher was saying.The class focused on language and literacy development, and in the first few weeks of school, hed been of two minds about it: first, thinking that most of what the professor was saying struck him as common sense, which made him wonder what hed gain from being there; and second, that there might be some as yet unknown advantage to quantifying common sense into some sort of cohesive classroom strategy so hed be able to put together formal lesson plans.The only problem was that the professor  a neurotic middle aged woman with a singsong voice  tended to wander from one subject to the next, which made paying attention somewhat difficult.He was in his third year of college, but it was his first semester at UNC Wilmington.His first two years had been spent at Cape Fear Community College, where hed finished with a perfect GPA.So far, he couldnt tell whether the classes were harder here or there; in the end, that would come down to the difficulty of the exams and the quality expected of his papers.He wasnt too concerned: He made a point to read ahead whenever possible, and he knew Lily would help him study, quizzing him when he needed it in addition to helping him edit his papers.As a rule, he liked to put in at least twenty five hours a week of studying, in addition to time in class; whenever he had a break on campus, he wandered to the library, and so far, it seemed to be paying off.Unlike many of the students who were here for both an education and a social life, he was here only to learn as much as he could and get the best grades possible.Hed already done the sow your wild oats thing; in fact, it had been all he could do to escape it.Still, he felt pretty good about having made it to this point.He had Evan and Lily; he had his MMA training and a place he called his own.He wasnt too fond of his job  the restaurant where he bartended was too touristy for his own tastes  but it wasnt the kind of place that led to him getting into any kind of trouble.Most people came there to eat, including lots of families with kids, and those who sat at the bar were usually waiting for a table or having dinner.It was certainly a far cry from the kind of bar he used to frequent.During his wild years, hed favored pro bars  for professional alcoholics  those dark and dingy out of the way dives with or without blaring music in the background.Hed expected problems almost as soon as he walked in the door, and the world had obliged him.These days, he avoided places like that at all costs.He knew his triggers and his limits, and though hed come a long way in keeping his anger in check, there was always the possibility that hed find himself in a situation that quickly spiraled out of control.And there was no doubt in his mind that even if he was involved in an incident in another state, Margolis would find out and hed live in a cage for the next decade, surrounded by people who had the same kind of anger problems as he did.Realizing that he was drifting, he forced himself to focus on the lecture again.The professor was telling them that some teachers found it beneficial to read passages from books that were age appropriate, as opposed to books that were geared toward older or younger students.He wondered whether to jot that down in his notes  did he really need to remind himself of that in the future?before deciding, Oh, what the hell.If she thought it important enough to say, hed make note of it.It was around that point, however, that he noticed a dark haired girl peeking at him over her shoulder.While hed drawn the expected stares when hed entered the classroom  even the professor had done a double take and broken off in midsentence  by now the stares had been redirected toward the front of the room.Except for this girl.Definitely watching him, almost scrutinizing.He didnt get the sense that she was flirting; rather, it was almost like she was trying to figure him out.Not that it mattered to him one way or the other.Stare or not; it was her choice.When class finished a few minutes later, Colin closed his notebook and stuffed it into his backpack.Flinging his backpack over his shoulder, he winced when it thumped against his bruised ribs.After classes, he planned to head to the gym to work out, but he wasnt up for contact just yet.No sparring or grappling; just weights, core work, and a half hour of jumping rope.Hed take a break for a bit, then pop in his earbuds and run five miles while listening to the kind of music his parents had always hated, and after that, hed shower and get ready for work.He wondered how his boss was going to react when she saw him; he suspected she wouldnt be pleased.His face wouldnt exactly blend in with the touristy atmosphere, but what could he do?With an hour until his next class, he began walking toward the library.He had a paper to write, and though hed gotten a start on it last week, he wanted to finish the first draft in the next couple of days, which wasnt going to be easy.Between training and work, he had to utilize his limited free time efficiently.Still sore from the fight, he walked slowly, noting the reactions of the girls who passed him.They were nearly uniform: Theyd spot him and do a quick double take, revealing expressions of shock and fear, and then pretend not to have even noticed him at all.The thought amused him  a single Boo!would likely send them fleeing in the opposite direction.As he turned onto a different walkway, a voice called out from behind him.Hey, wait up!You, up there!Certain it wasnt directed at him, he ignored it.Hey you, with the hurt face!I said wait up!It took Colin a second to make sure he had heard right, but when he stopped and turned, he spotted the dark haired girl from class, waving.He glanced over his shoulder; no one else was paying attention.As she finally closed in, he recognized her as the girl whod been watching him in class.Are you talking to me?Ya think?she said, stopping a few feet away.Who else has a hurt face around here?He wasnt sure whether to be offended or laugh, but she said it in a way that made it impossible to take umbrage.Do I know you?Were in class together.I know.I saw you staring at me.But I still dont know you.Youre right, she said.Were strangers.But may I ask you a question?He knew exactly what was coming  the whole hurt face thing was the tip off  and he hitched up his backpack.I was in a fight.Obviously, she said.But thats not what I wanted to ask you.I wanted to know how old you are.He blinked in surprise.Im twenty eight.Why?Thats perfect, she said, not answering his question.Where are you going?To the library.Good.Me too.May I join you?I think we should talk.Why?She smiled, vaguely reminding him of someone else.If we talk, you can find out.CHAPTER 4      Maria      W  here are we going again?Maria asked from the drivers seat.Shed picked up Serena half an hour earlier on South Front Street, which ran parallel to the Cape Fear River.Serena had been standing at an intersection in an area dotted with older office buildings and occasional clusters of shacks and boathouses at the rivers edge, oblivious to the construction workers across the street who were clearly ogling her.Slowly but surely, the area was being revitalized, like the rest of the waterfront along the river, but for now it was a work in progress.And why did I have to pick you up?Ive already told you.Were going to a restaurant, Serena answered.And you picked me up because I dont plan on driving tonight, since I might have a couple of drinks.She tossed a lock of hair over her shoulder.The interview went well, by the way.Charles said he found my answers very thoughtful.Thanks for asking.Maria rolled her eyes.How did you get there?Steve dropped me off.I think he likes me.Hes meeting me here later.He has to like you if hes willing to put up with this traffic.Though the first half of September had passed, the heat was more reminiscent of early August and the shore was packed.Maria had already circled the block twice searching for a place to park.Who cares?Were at the beach.There are better places to eat downtown.How would you know?Have you even been to Wrightsville Beach since you moved back?No.My point exactly.You live in Wilmington.You need to get to the beach every now and then.I paddleboard, remember?I see the beach a lot more than you do.I mean someplace with actual people around, not just birds and turtles and the occasional jumping fish.You need to go someplace fun with a great view and a lot of atmosphere.Crabby Petes?Its a local institution.Its a tourist trap.So what?Ive never been there and I want to find out what the big deal is.Maria brought her lips together.Why am I getting the sense that theres more to this than youre saying?Because youre a lawyer.Youre suspicious of everything.Maybe.Or it could simply be that youve got something planned.What makes you say that?Because its Saturday night.We never go out on Saturday night.Youve never wanted to go out with me on Saturday night.Thats why were having an early dinner, Serena answered.There are a bunch of bands playing in the bars down here this weekend, and Steve and I and a few friends are going to listen to some music before we hit the parties.They dont get going until ten or eleven anyway, so theres plenty of time.Maria knew that Serena had something up her sleeve but couldnt quite put her finger on it.I hope you dont expect me to tag along.Not a chance, Serena huffed.Youre way too old for that.It would be like going out with our parents.Gee, thanks.Dont blame me.Youre the one who said you were too old for guys my age.Why?Are you changing your mind?No.Thats why were just having dinner.Maria suddenly spotted another car vacating a spot and she turned, closing in on it.It was still a block or two from the restaurant, but she doubted shed be able to get any closer.As she parked, she couldnt shake the feeling that Serena was being way too coy, and Serena seemed to realize it.Stop worrying so much.Youre killing the mood.Whats wrong with spending a little time with your sister?Maria hesitated.Fine, but just so were clear if youre planning to have some other guy join us at the table or something crazy like that, Im not going to be happy.Im not Jill and Paul, okay?I wouldnt set you up on some awful blind date without even asking you.But if it makes you feel any better, I can guarantee that no guy will sit with us.In fact, well just eat at the bar.The view is supposed to be better anyway.Deal?Maria debated before finally shutting off the engine.Deal.Located next to one of the piers at Wrightsville Beach, Crabby Petes had been around for nearly forty years.Having barely survived one hurricane after the next, the structure might have been condemned had not numerous repairs of varying quality been undertaken over the years.The building sported peeling paint, a listing rooftop, and more than a few missing or broken shutters.Despite its appearance, the restaurant was bustling and Maria and Serena had to squeeze through the crowd waiting for tables as they made for the stairs leading to the rooftop bar.Following her sister, Maria noticed the wooden tables, mismatched chairs, and personalized graffiti on the walls.From the ceiling hung items that the original Pete  whod passed away years ago  had supposedly found in his nets while fishing: hubcaps and tennis shoes, deflated basketballs, a womans bra, toys, and scores of license plates from more than ten states.Pretty cool, huh?Serena called over her shoulder.Its certainly crowded.Its an experience.Come on!They climbed the creaking steps to the rooftop.Emerging into the sun, Maria squinted under a cloudless sky.Unlike in the restaurant downstairs, the tables up here were occupied by adults unwinding with open bottles of beer or mixed drinks in front of them.Three waitresses in shorts and black tank tops scurried among the customers, efficiently picking up empties and dropping off drinks.Half the tables had tin pails filled with crab legs, and she watched as diners cracked the shells to get to the meat.Were in luck, Serena said.There are two seats at the bar.The bar was on the far side, partially covered with a rusting tin awning and fronted by ten stools.Maria followed Serena, winding between the tables in the fierce sun.It was cooler in the shade of the bars awning, though, and as they took their seats, she could feel the salt tinged breeze lifting the long hair off her neck.Over Serenas shoulder, Maria could see the waves breaking on the shore, blue changing suddenly to white and back again.Even though it was almost dinnertime, hundreds of beachgoers still frolicked in the water or sprawled on towels.The pier was jammed with people leaning over the railing with their fishing poles, waiting for something to strike.Serena took in the scene before swiveling back to Maria.Admit it, Serena challenged.This is exactly what you needed.Say that I was right.Fine.You were right.I love it when you say that, she crowed.Now lets get something to drink.What are you in the mood for?Just a glass of wine.No, no, no, Serena declared, suddenly shaking her head.Youre not having a glass of wine here.This isnt a glass of wine kind of place.We need to do something beachy, like were on vacation.A pia colada or margarita or something like that.Seriously?You really have to learn to live a little.Serena leaned over the bar.Hey, Colin!Can we get a couple of drinks?Maria hadnt noticed the bartender and her eyes followed Serenas.Dressed in faded jeans and a white collared shirt rolled to the elbows, he was finishing up an order for a waitress on the far side.Maria noticed automatically that he was exceptionally fit, with well defined shoulders tapering down to narrow hips.He wore his hair very short, almost in a buzz cut that revealed an intricate tattooed ivy design wrapping around the back of his neck.Though his back was turned, Maria was impressed by how efficiently he moved as he readied the cocktails.She leaned toward her sister.I thought you said youve never been here before.I havent.Then how do you know the bartenders name?My friend works here.At Serenas answer, the bartender turned.With his face partially shadowed, his features werent immediately visible, and it wasnt until he stepped closer that Maria noticed the fading bruise on his cheek and all at once, it came together.The bartender froze for a second as well, no doubt mirroring her own thoughts: Youve got to be kidding.In the awkward moment that followed, Maria had the impression that while he wasnt thrilled by Serenas surprise, he wasnt necessarily upset by it, either.He resumed his approach until he was standing right in front of them.Leaning forward, he rested his hand on the bar, revealing the sculpted, colorfully tattooed muscle of his forearm.Hey, Serena, he said.His unhurried, confident voice was exactly as Maria remembered.You decided to come.Serena seemed content to act as though she hadnt orchestrated the whole scenario.I figured, why not?Its a gorgeous day!She spread her arms wide.What a great place!You were right about the view from up here.Its incredible.Has it been busy today?Ive been overrun.No wonder.Who wouldnt want to come on a day like today?Oh, by the way, this is my sister, Maria.Colins gaze met hers, unreadable except for a trace of amusement somewhere in its depths.Up close, his appearance was nothing like it had been on the night hed changed her tire; with his high cheekbones, blue gray eyes, and long lashes, it was easy to imagine him picking up almost any woman he wanted.Hi, Maria, he said, extending his hand across the bar.Im Colin.She took his hand in hers, feeling a restrained strength in his grip.Letting go, she watched as his gaze flickered from her to Serena and back again.What can I get you?he asked.Serena studied them both before finally propping her elbows on the bar.How about a couple of pia coladas?Coming right up, he said easily.Turning around, he grabbed the blender and bent over to reach into the refrigerator, his jeans growing tight around his thighs.Maria watched as he added the ingredients before turning her narrowed gaze on Serena.Really?Maria said, more a statement than a question.What?Serena asked, sounding pleased with herself.This is why we came?Because you wanted us to meet?Youre the one who said you never had a chance to thank him.Nows your chance.Maria shook her head, amazed.How did you?Colins in my class.She reached for a bucket of peanuts on the bar and snapped one of them open.Actually, hes in two of my classes, but we really only met this week.While we were getting to know each other, he mentioned that he worked here and that he had a shift this afternoon.I thought it might be fun for us to drop in and say hello.Of course you did.Whats the big deal?Well be out of here soon and you can head back home and take up knitting mittens for cats or whatever.Dont make this into something that it isnt.Why should I?Youve already done that.Talk to him, dont talk to him, Serena said, reaching for another peanut, it doesnt matter to me.Its your life, not mine.And besides, were already here, lets just enjoy it, okay?I really hate that you   In case youre interested, Serena interrupted, Colin is actually a very nice guy.Smart, too.And you have to admit, hes kind of hot as far as bartenders go.She lowered her voice to a whisper.I actually think his tattoos are sexy, she said, nodding toward him.Ill bet hes got some more that arent visible, too.Maria struggled to find words.I think she sputtered, trying to sort through it all and experiencing the same sort of confusion she had on the night shed first met Colin.Can we please just have our drinks and go?Serena made a face.But Im hungry.Colin returned with their drinks and set the foamy glasses in front of them.Anything else?he asked.Before Maria could decline, Serena raised her voice over the sound of the crowd.Could we have a menu?Serena pointedly ignored Marias obvious discomfort all through dinner.Still, Maria had to admit that it wasnt as uncomfortable as shed feared, mostly because Colin was too busy to treat them as anything other than ordinary customers.He mentioned nothing about changing Marias tire or about his classes with Serena; because of the crowd at the bar, he had barely enough time to keep up with orders.He hustled continuously from one end of the bar to the other, taking orders and making drinks, closing out bills, and getting the waitresses what they needed.In the next hour, the rooftop only became more crowded, and despite the addition of a second bartender a few minutes after theyd arrived  a pretty blonde perhaps a year older than Serena  the wait for drinks continued to grow.If there was any indication that Colin knew Serena at all, it was that their dinner order was taken and delivered promptly, as was a second round of drinks.He cleared their plates moments after they finished and dropped off the bill, which he also closed out as soon as Maria laid down her credit card.Meanwhile, Serena kept up a steady flow of lively chatter.There were even moments when Maria forgot about Colin entirely, though from time to time she found her gaze flickering his way.Serena hadnt said anything more about him, but Maria thought he seemed too old to be a college student.She supposed she could ask Serena about that, but she didnt want to give her the satisfaction, since shed dragged Maria here under false pretenses.Despite herself, Maria had to admit that Serena was right about the fact that Colin  when he wasnt bruised, bloody, and soaking wet on a deserted stretch of road  was seriously good looking.Oddly clean cut despite his tattoos and powerful build, he had a quick, almost wry grin, and as far as she could tell, all three of the waitresses had crushes on him.So did the group of women at the far end of the bar whod shown up twenty minutes ago.She could tell by the way they smiled at him as he prepared their drinks and watched him after hed turned away.Same thing with the other bartender; though she was as busy as Colin, she seemed to become noticeably distracted whenever he reached past her for a glass or a bottle of liquor.Good looking bartenders were common enough to be a clich, as was the practice of flirting with them, but Colins reaction to the subtle and not so subtle signals surprised her.Though he was pleasant with everyone, he otherwise seemed oblivious to his admirers attention.Or, at least, he was acting oblivious.As she was trying to decode his motive, another, older male bartender moved behind the bar, partially blocking her view of Colin.Beside her, Serena had her phone out and was texting.Im letting Steve and Melissa know that were about done, Serena said, her fingers dancing.Are they here?Theyre walking this way now, she said.When Maria just nodded, Serena went on.Hes twenty eight, you know.Steve?No, Serena answered.Steve is my age.Colin is twenty eight.And?Youre twenty eight, too.Yes, I know.Serena drained her drink.I figured I might as well mention it, since youve been sneaking peeks at him all night.No, I havent.You could have fooled me.Maria reached for her own drink, feeling slightly buoyant from the alcohol.Okay, she conceded, maybe I did check him out once or twice.But twenty eight is a little too old to still be in college, dont you think?That depends.Depends on what?On when he started.Colin didnt start until a couple of years ago, so hes right on schedule.He wants to be an elementary school teacher, just like me.And if youre curious, his grades are probably better than mine.He takes his classes very seriously.He sits at the front of the class and takes ridiculous notes.Why are you telling me this?Because its obvious that youre interested in him.Im not interested in him.Youve been making that clear all night, Serena agreed, feigning innocence.Hes definitely not the type youd ever want to go dancing with.A guy that handsome?Please.Maria opened her mouth to respond but closed it again, knowing that saying anything more would only encourage her sister further.In the silence, Serenas phone pinged and she peered down at it.Steves downstairs.You ready to go?Or would you rather wait here for a bit?Why?Because you want me to hit on Colin?Hes not here.Maria looked up; sure enough, Colin was gone.He was working the afternoon shift, so hes probably off the clock, Serena added, sliding off her stool.She hitched her purse over her shoulder.Thanks for dinner, by the way.Do you want to walk down with me?Maria reached for her purse.I thought you said you didnt want me to meet Steve.I was kidding.He wants to be a lawyer, by the way.Maybe you can talk him out of it.Why would I do that?Do you really need me to answer that question after all youve been through?Maria was silent.Serena, like their parents, knew how hard the last couple of years had been.Still, Serena said, its a shame.Whats a shame?I know Colin was busy tonight, but you never did thank him for changing your tire.You might not want to talk to him, but it was a nice thing for him to do that night, and you could have told him so.Again Maria said nothing, but as she followed Serena to the stairs, she found herself thinking that her sister was, as usual, right.Steve was cute in a preppy kind of way, right down to the plaid shorts and light blue polo that matched his Topsiders.He came across as nice enough, though it was apparent within minutes that he was a lot more interested in Serena than she was in him, since she spent most of her time talking to Melissa.Though Maria chided herself for it as she started in the direction of her car, she found herself envying the ease with which her younger sister seemed to navigate every facet of her life.Then again, how hard was life for a twenty one year old student?College was a bubble that kept the rest of the world at bay.There was an abundance of free time, friends who lived either with you or right next door, and an overwhelming sense of optimism about the future, even if you had no idea as to the specifics of what that might mean.In college, everyone accepted the fact that their lives would turn out exactly as planned, buoying them from one good memory to the next in a cascade of carefree three day weekends.She hesitated, changing her mind.Well, for people like Serena, anyway.Marias own experience had been different because shed taken her education more seriously than most  she could remember being way too stressed way too often.In retrospect, she realized that shed probably spent too much time studying and worrying about exams.She recalled working on papers until the wee hours of the morning, editing them over and over until every word was just right.At the time, it seemed like the most important thing in the world, but in the last few years, shed begun to wonder why shed taken it all so seriously.Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Michael Dell, and Mark Zuckerberg had dropped out of college, and theyd done okay, right?They intuitively understood that the world didnt care about grades or even graduating, at least not in the long run, especially when compared to traits like creativity or persistence.Sure, her grades had likely helped her land her very first job with the district attorneys office, but had anyone cared since then?When shed been hired at the firm, theyd been interested only in her work experience and seemed to regard the first twenty four years of her life as inconsequential.These days, Barneys conversations were centered on her current work product, and Kens interests were of a different nature entirely.Thinking back, she regretted not taking a year off after graduation and going backpacking through Europe, or volunteering for Teach for America or whatever.Frankly, it didnt matter what she did as long as it was something interesting, but shed been in such a headlong rush to grow up and become an adult that those thoughts had never even entered her mind.She didnt always feel like she was really living, though, and she sometimes found herself regretting the choices shed made.And on that subject, wasnt she too young to have these kinds of regrets, anyway?Werent those supposed to start in middle age?Lord knows, her mom and dad didnt seem to have any and they were middle aged.Meanwhile, Serena acted as though she didnt have a care in the world, either  so where had Maria gone wrong?She blamed her melancholy thoughts on the pia coladas, whose effects she was still feeling a bit.Deciding to give herself a little more time before she got behind the wheel, she squinted at the pier and decided, Why not?Dusk was coming on, but she still had another hour or so before it was dark.Turning around, she started that way, watching the chaotic activity as families began to depart the beach en masse.Sunburned kids, overtired and whining, trailed their equally sunburned and overtired parents, who were hauling boogie boards, coolers, umbrellas, and towels.At the beach, she stopped to slip off her sandals, wondering if shed recognize anyone from high school or whether theyd recognize her, but she spotted no one familiar.She trudged through the sand and when she reached the pier, she made her way up the steps just as the sun was beginning its slow descent.Through the slats beneath her feet, she watched as sand gave way to shallow water, then finally to waves cascading toward the shore.In either direction, surfers were still catching swells.Admiring their graceful movements, she passed people fishing; men and women, young and old, all of them lost in their own worlds.She remembered that when she had been a teenager, a boy shed liked had once talked her into giving it a try.It was a blazing hot day and casting was more difficult than she thought it would be.They eventually left the pier empty handed, and she later realized that she liked the boy a lot more than shed ever like fishing.The crowds grew sparser the farther out she got, and by the time she reached the end of the pier she noticed only a lone fisherman, his back toward her.He was dressed in faded jeans and a baseball cap, but from her cursory glance she could tell that he was put together just right.Shrugging off the thought, she turned her gaze to the horizon, catching sight of the moon rising from the sea.In the distance, a catamaran glided over the surface, and she idly wondered whether Serena might be persuaded to join her on a sailing trip one weekend.Are you following me?The voice came from the corner of the pier.When she turned, it took a few seconds for her to register that it was Colin.The fisherman in the baseball cap, she suddenly realized.She felt heat rise in her cheeks.Had Serena set this up, too?No, coming out here had been her idea.Hadnt it?Serena hadnt talked about Colin or the pier which meant this had to be a coincidence, like the night hed pulled over and changed her tire.What were the odds of meeting him here?Too low to be plausible, and yet he was here and she was here, and she could tell he was waiting for an answer.No, she stammered.Im not following you.I just came out here to enjoy the view.He seemed to weigh her answer.And?And what?The view.How is it?Flustered, she had to process his question before she could answer.Its beautiful, she finally said.Better than from the restaurant?Different.More peaceful.I think so, too.Thats why Im here.But youre fishing?Not really, he said.Like you, Im mainly here to appreciate the scenery.He smiled before leaning over the railing.I didnt mean to bother you, he assured her.Enjoy the sunset, Maria.Somehow, hearing him say her name out here felt more intimate than it had in the bar, and she absently watched as he began reeling in his line.He cast again, the line unspooling into the distance, and she wondered whether she should stay or go.He seemed content to give her space, just as hed done the night theyd first met.Which reminded her  Hey, Colin?He turned his head.Yes?I should have thanked you for changing my tire the other night.You really saved me.Youre welcome.I was glad to help.He smiled.And Im glad you came to the restaurant tonight, too.That was Serenas idea.I could tell.You didnt seem all that happy to see me.It wasnt that.I was just surprised.Me too.Maria could feel his gaze lingering on her before he finally turned away.She wasnt quite sure how to respond, and for a while, the two of them simply stood there in silence.Colin seemed perfectly relaxed and self contained, while Maria tried to immerse herself in the view once again.A shrimp boat trawled the darker waters in the distance, and over her shoulder, the lights flickered on at Crabby Petes.The faint strains of classic rock began to drift out of one of the restaurants, signaling the beginning of the evening festivities.She studied Colin from the corner of her eye, trying to figure out why he seemed so different than other men.In her experience, men her age generally fell into one of five categories: arrogant types who believed themselves to be one of Gods favorite creations; friendly guys who might become keepers except for the fact that they often werent interested in relationships; shy guys who could barely speak; men who werent interested in her at all for one reason or another; and really good ones  genuine keepers  who were almost always taken, in her experience.Colin didnt seem like the first kind, and based on what shed observed at the bar, he didnt seem like the second or third kinds, either.Which meant, obviously, that he was either the fourth or fifth kind.He wasnt interested in her and yet, deep down, she suspected that she might be wrong about that, though she wasnt sure why.Which left the possibility that he was in the fifth category, but unfortunately, shed pretty much ended the conversation earlier, so maybe his silence was a reaction to her perceived standoffishness.After hed changed her tire.After his friendly efficiency at the bar.After Serena had assured her that he was a nice guy.And after hed initiated a conversation just a few moments earlier.She felt her shoulders slump.No wonder she spent her weekends alone.Hey, Colin?she tried again.He was still leaning over the railing, and when he turned after a moment, she detected the same trace of amusement shed noticed in the bar.Yes?May I ask you a question?Yes.His blue gray eyes glowed like sea glass.Why do you like fishing?He reached up, tilting his hat back slightly.I guess I dont, really.And Im not very good at it, either.I hardly ever catch anything.She registered the soft precision of his speech.Then why do you do it?Its a good way to unwind after work, especially when its busy Its just nice to have a few minutes to myself, you know?I come out here and its quiet and the world slows down for a while.I started bringing a pole because it gave me something to do, instead of just standing out here and staring at the horizon.Like I was doing?Exactly.Would you like to borrow my pole?When she laughed under her breath, he went on.Besides, I think it made people nervous when I just stood out here brooding, like I was up to no good.And earlier this week, with the bruises, I probably would have scared them, too.Id like to think you came off as contemplative.I doubt it.You, on the other hand, come across as the type who frequently contemplates things.Life.Goals.Dreams.She flushed, feeling too tongue tied to answer.Despite herself, she couldnt help agreeing with Serena: Colin was seriously hot.She shook the thought away, not wanting to go there.Do you mind?he said, motioning toward her before leaning over and grabbing his tackle box.Im not having a lot of luck over here.His suggestion caught her off guard.Uh, yeah sure.But if youre not very good at fishing, I cant promise this spot will be any better.It probably wont be, he admitted, drawing near.He set the tackle box beside him on the pier, leaving a comfortable distance between them.But I wont have to talk so loud.Unlike her, he seemed perfectly relaxed, and she watched as he reeled in his line and recast in a new location.He leaned forward, jerking the pole slightly.Your sister has quite a personality, he said after a moment.Why do you say that?Her introduction to me included the words, Hey you, with the hurt face.Maria grinned, thinking that sounded exactly like Serena.Shes one of a kind, thats for sure.But shes more like a friend than a sister, right?Did she tell you that?No, he said.I noticed it while I waited on the two of you.Its easy to tell youre pretty close.We are, Maria agreed.Do you have siblings?Two older sisters.Are you close?Not like you and Serena, he admitted as he adjusted the fishing line.I love them and I care about them, but we kind of ended up taking different paths in life.Which means?We dont really talk that often.Maybe once every couple of months or so.Its been improving lately, but its a gradual process.Thats too bad.It is what it is, he said.His answer suggested he didnt really want to discuss it further.Serena said that you and she are in class together?she asked, venturing on to safer ground.He nodded.She caught up with me on the way to the library.I guess you must have told her how I looked that night and she put it all together.Which wasnt too hard, what with the hurt face and all.It wasnt so bad.I didnt really think much about it.When he raised an eyebrow, she shrugged.All right.So maybe I was a little scared when you walked up.Makes sense.It was late and you were in the middle of nowhere.Thats one of the reasons I stopped.What was the other reason?You were a girl.And you think all girls need help changing a tire?Not all girls.But my sisters and my mom would have needed help.And I didnt get the sense that you were having a lot of fun.She nodded.Thank you again.You already said that.I know.But it deserved to be said a second time.Okay.Just okay?The corners of her mouth turned up.Its my go to phrase when someone makes a statement instead of asking a question.She wrinkled her forehead.I suppose that makes sense.Okay, he said, and despite herself, she laughed, finally beginning to relax.Do you like bartending?she asked.Its all right, he answered.It pays the bills while Im in school, I can pretty much pick my schedule, and the tips are good.But I hope Im not forced to make it a career.Theres more I want to do with my life.Serena said you want to be a teacher.I do, he agreed.Where did she go, by the way?She met up with some friends.Theyll troll the bars for a while and listen to music, then probably head off to a party or whatever.Why didnt you join them?Im a little old for college parties, dont you think?I dont know.How old are you?Twenty eight.Im twenty eight and Im still in college.Yeah, she thought, I know.And you go to college parties?No, he conceded, but its not because I think Im too old.I just dont go to parties.Bars, either.But you work at a bar.Thats different.Why?Because I work there.And even if I didnt, its not the kind of bar where Id end up getting in trouble, since its really more of a restaurant.You get in trouble at bars?I used to, he said.Not anymore.But you just said you dont go.Thats why I dont get into trouble.How about clubs?He shrugged.Depends on the club and who Im with.Usually, no.Every now and then, yes.Because you get into trouble there, too?I have in the past.She puzzled over his answer before finally turning toward the horizon again.The moon glowed against the backdrop of a sky that was beginning its slow progression from gray to black.Colin followed her gaze, neither of them speaking for a moment.What kind of trouble?she finally asked.He lifted the tip of his reel, jerking the line, before answering.Fights, he said.For a moment, she wasnt sure shed heard him right.You used to fight in bars?Up until a few years ago, I used to fight in bars all the time.Why would you get into fights?Guys usually go to bars for four reasons: to get drunk, to hang with friends, to pick up girls, or to fight.I would show up for all four.You wanted to fight?Usually.How many times?Im not sure I understand the question.How many times did you get into fights?I cant remember exactly.Probably over a hundred.She blinked.You were in over a hundred bar fights?Yes.She wasnt sure what to say.Why are you telling me this?Because you asked.And you answer everything that people ask you?Not everything.But you think telling me about something like this is okay?Yes.Why?Im guessing youre a lawyer, right?She inhaled, thrown by the sudden change in subject.Did Serena tell you that?No.Then how did you know I was a lawyer?I didnt know.I thought it was a possibility because you ask a lot of questions.Most lawyers do.And given all those bar fights, youve probably had a lot of experience with lawyers?Yes.I still cant believe youre telling me this.Why wouldnt I tell you?Because admitting that you used to get in bar fights isnt something that people usually do when first getting to know each other.Okay, he said.But like I said, I dont do that anymore.What about the other night?That was an MMA match.Mixed martial arts.Its entirely different from what I used to do in the past.Its still fighting, isnt it?Its a sport  like boxing or tae kwon do.She squinted at him.Is MMA the one in the cage?Where anything goes?Yes to the first, and no to the second, he said.There are rules.Actually, there are a lot of rules, even if it can be violent.And you enjoy the violence?Its good for me.Why?Because it helps to keep you out of trouble?Among other things.He smiled, and for the first time in a long, long while, she found herself utterly at a loss for words.CHAPTER 5      Colin      C  olin had witnessed reactions like Marias before, and he knew she was debating whether she should stick around.People generally had negative reactions to hearing about his past.While he no longer beat himself up for his mistakes, he wasnt proud of them, either.He was who he was, warts and all, and he accepted that.Now it was her turn to make a decision.He knew that Evan would have shaken his head at the way Colin had answered her questions, but aside from Colins desire to be honest, what Evan didnt understand was that trying to hide the truth about his past was futile, even if he wanted to keep it hidden.People were both curious and cautious, and he knew that a quick Internet search using his name would yield a handful of newspaper articles about him, none of them good.And if he hadnt laid it out there from the beginning?Either Maria or Serena may have Googled him the same way Victoria had.Hed met Victoria at the gym a couple of years ago, and after chatting off and on for a few months, theyd fallen into occasionally working out together.Hed thought they were getting along well and considered her a good training partner until shed suddenly begun to avoid him.Shed stopped returning his texts or calls and started working out in the mornings instead of the evenings.When he was finally able to talk to her about it, shed revealed what shed learned about him and insisted that he stop trying to contact her.She hadnt been interested in excuses and Colin hadnt offered any, but he did wonder why shed conducted her Internet research in the first place.It wasnt as though theyd been dating; he wasnt sure theyd even reached the friendship stage yet.A month later, shed stopped coming to the gym at all, and that was the last hed seen of her.She hadnt been the only one whod shied away after learning the truth about Colin, and while Evan might joke that Colin immediately volunteered his full history to anyone who asked, it wasnt like that.It generally wasnt anyone elses business, and he kept it that way, unless someone was  or might become  part of his life somehow.Though it was way too early to tell whether Maria fell into that category, Serena was a classmate, and if shed talked to him once, she just might talk to him again.He admitted that there was something about Maria that interested him, however.Part of it was the way she looked, of course  she was a more mature, more striking version of Serena, with the same dark hair and eyes  but at the bar, hed noted her lack of vanity.Though shed drawn stares from any number of men on the rooftop, she hadnt been aware of it, which was extremely rare.But his initial impressions ran deeper than that.Unlike Serena  who was bubbly and chatty and not really his type  Maria was quieter, more contemplative, and obviously intelligent.And now?He observed Maria as she tried to figure out whether she wanted to stay or go, continue the conversation or say good bye.He said nothing, giving her room to make her own decision.Instead, he concentrated on the feel of the breeze and the sound of the waves.Staring down the pier, he noticed that most of the people whod been fishing had cleared out; those who still remained were packing up their gear or cleaning their catch.Maria leaned a little farther over the railing.The darkening sky cast her face in shadow, making her appear mysterious, unknowable.He watched as she drew a long breath.What other things?she finally asked.Colin smiled inwardly.As much as I enjoy working out, there are times when Im just not in the mood.But knowing that I have a match coming up, and knowing I have to train for it, gets me off the couch and into the gym.Every day?He nodded.Usually two or three different sessions.It takes a lot of time.What do you do?Almost anything, he said with a shrug.A big chunk of my training is centered around striking and grappling, but after that, I try to mix it up as much as I can.I do Olympic and heavy lifting, but Ill also do spin classes, yoga, kayaking, circuit work, running, rope climbs, stairs, plyometrics, body weight exercises, whatever.As long as I can break a sweat, Im happy.You do yoga?Its not only good for flexibility and balance, but its great for me mentally.Its like meditating.He nodded at the water, burnished red gold in the last rays of the sun.Kind of like being out here after a shift.She squinted at him.You dont look like a guy who does yoga.Guys who do yoga are  He finished for her.Skinny?Bearded?Into things like incense and beads?She laughed.I was going to say theyre usually not into violence.Neither am I.  Not anymore.Obviously, injuries can happen during one of my fights, but I dont necessarily want to hurt anyone.I just want to win.Dont the two go together?Sometimes, but not always.If you get your opponents in the right submission hold, theyll tap out and walk away good as new.She twirled the bracelet on her wrist.Is it scary?Walking into that cage?If youre scared, you probably shouldnt be getting into the ring in the first place.For me, its more of a rush that gets the adrenaline flowing.The key is to keep the adrenaline under control.He began reeling in his line.I take it youre pretty good.Im all right for an amateur, but Id struggle in the pros.Some of those guys were NCAA level wrestlers or Olympic boxers, and theyre out of my league.But Im fine with that.Its not my dream to go pro  its just something to do until I graduate.When the time comes, Ill be ready to walk away.Instead of casting again, he fastened the hook and lure to the pole, then tightened the line.And besides, teaching and cage fighting dont exactly mesh.Id probably scare the little kids like I scared you.Little kids?I want to teach third grade, he said.He bent over, reaching for his tackle box.Its getting dark, he added.You ready to head back?Or would you like to stay out here a bit longer?We can go, she said.As Colin set the pole on his shoulder, she noted the restaurants lit from within, lines of people already forming at the doors, the faint strains of music filling the air.Its starting to get crowded down here.Thats why I asked to work the day shift.Itll be a zoo on the rooftop tonight.Good for tips, no?Not worth the aggravation.Too many college kids.She laughed, the sound warm and melodic.They began to retrace the steps theyd taken earlier, neither feeling the need to rush.In the dimming light, she was alluring, her slight smile making him wonder what she was thinking.Have you always lived here?he asked, breaking the peaceful lull.I grew up here and moved back last December, she answered.Between college, law school, and working in Charlotte, I was gone for about ten years.Youre not from here, though, right?Im from Raleigh, he said.Spent summers here when I was a kid, lived here on and off for a month or two for a few years after high school.Ive been living here permanently the last three years.Weve probably been neighbors at times and didnt even know it.I went to UNC and Duke.Neighbors or not, I doubt we traveled in the same social circles.She smiled.So you came here to go to college?Not at first.College came a little after that.I came here because my parents kicked me out of the house and I wasnt sure where else to go.My friend Evan was living here and I ended up renting a room from him.Your parents kicked you out?He nodded.I needed a wakeup call.They gave me one.Oh.She tried to keep her voice neutral.I dont blame them, he said.I deserved it.I would have kicked me out, too.Because of the fights?Theres more to it than just that, but the fights were part of it.I was kind of a problem child.And then, after high school, I was a problem adult for a while.He glanced over at her.What about you?Do you live with your parents?She shook her head.I have a condo down on Market Street.As much as I love them, theres no way I could live with my parents.What do they do?They own La Cocina de la Familia.Its a restaurant here in town.Ive heard of it, but I havent been there.You should go.The food is really authentic  my mom still cooks a lot of it herself  and the place is always packed.If I mention your name, will I get a discount?Do you need a discount?Not really.Im just wondering how far weve progressed.Ill see what I can do.Im sure Id be able to pull some strings.By then, they were over the sand and headed for the stairs.He followed as she bounded gracefully down the steps.Do you want me to walk you to your car?he asked, meeting her gaze.Ill be okay, she demurred.Its not far.He moved the rod from one shoulder to the other, reluctant for the evening to end.If Serenas going out with her friends, what were your plans for the rest of the night?Nothing, really.Why?Do you want to listen to some music?Since were already here?Its not that late yet.His question seemed to take her by surprise, and for a moment, he thought she might say no.She adjusted her purse strap, fidgeting with the buckle.While he waited, he thought again that she was beautiful, her long, dark lashes shrouding her thoughts.I thought you didnt go to bars.I dont.But we could walk the beach for a bit, listen for something good, and enjoy it where we are.Are any of the bands any good?I have no idea.Uncertainty was written on her face before he saw something finally give way.All right.But I dont want to stay long.Maybe just a walk on the beach, okay?I dont want to be down here when the crowds descend.He smiled, feeling something unwind within him, and raised the tackle box.Let me just drop this off, all right?Id rather not carry it the whole time.They backtracked to the restaurant, and once he stowed his things in the employee area, they wandered back down to the sand.The stars were beginning to emerge, brilliant pinpricks in the velvety sky.The waves continued their steady roll and the warm breeze was like a quiet exhale.As they strolled, he was conscious of the fact that she was close enough to touch, but he pushed the realization away.What kind of law do you practice?Mainly insurance defense work.Research and depositions, negotiation, and as a final resort, litigation.And you defend insurance companies?For the most part.Every now and then, were on the plaintiffs side, but its not that common.Does it keep you busy?Very.She nodded.Theres a policy for everything, and as much as the policy tries to anticipate every possibility, there are always gray areas.Lets say someone slips in your store and he sues, or an employee sues after getting fired, or maybe youre throwing a birthday party for your son and one of his friends gets hurt in your swimming pool.The insurance company is responsible for paying the claim, but sometimes they decide to fight the claim.Thats where we step in.Because the other side always has lawyers.Do you ever go to court?I havent yet.Not for this job, anyway.Im still learning.The partner I do most of my work for goes to court quite a bit, but truthfully most of our cases are settled before they go to trial.In the end, its cheaper and less hassle for everyone involved.Ill bet you hear a lot of lawyer jokes.Not too many, she said.Why?Do you have one?He took a couple of steps.How does a lawyer sleep?At her shrug, he said, First he lies on one side, then he lies on the other.Ha, ha.Im kidding.Im the first to appreciate good lawyers.I had some brilliant ones.And you needed them?Yes, he answered.He knew that would trigger even more questions, but he continued on, nodding toward the ocean.I love walking the beach at night.Why?Its different than it is during the day, especially when the moon is out I like the mystery of thinking that anything could be out there, swimming just beneath the surface.Thats a scary thought.Thats why were here and not out there.She smiled at his words, surprisingly at ease as they meandered down the beach.Neither of them felt the need to speak.Colin focused on the sensation of his feet sinking into the sand and the warm breeze on his face.Watching Marias hair ripple in the wind, he realized that he was enjoying the walk more than hed anticipated.He reminded himself that they were strangers, but for some reason, it didnt quite feel that way.I have a question, but I dont know if its too personal, she finally said.Go ahead, he replied, already knowing what was coming.You said you were a problem adult and that you got in a lot of bar fights.And that you had some great lawyers.Yes.Was that because you were arrested?He adjusted his cap.Yes.More than once?A number of times, he admitted.For a while there, I was pretty much on a first name basis with any number of cops in Raleigh and Wilmington.Were you ever convicted?A few times, he said.And you went to prison?No.I probably spent a total of a year in county lockup.Not all at once, more like a month here, two months there.I never made it as far as prison.I would have  the last fight was pretty bad  but I caught a serious break and here I am.She lowered her chin slightly, no doubt questioning her decision to walk with him.When you say you caught a serious break  He took a few steps before answering.Ive been on probation for the last three years, with two more to go.Its part of the five year deal I received.Basically, if I dont get into any more trouble for the next two years, theyll clear my record entirely.Which means Ill be able to teach in the classroom, and thats important to me.People dont want felons teaching their children.On the other hand, if I mess up, the deal goes out the window and I go straight to prison.How is that possible?To completely clear your record?I was diagnosed with an anger disorder and PTSD, which affected my mens rea.You know what that is, right?In other words, youre saying you couldnt help it, she said.He shrugged.Not me.Thats what my psychiatrists said, and fortunately, I had the records to prove it.Id been in therapy for almost fifteen years, Ive been on medication periodically, and as part of my deal, I had to spend a few months at a psychiatric hospital in Arizona that specialized in anger disorders.And when you got back to Raleigh, your parents kicked you out of the house?Yes, he said.But all that together  the fight and potential prison sentence, the deal, my time at the hospital, and suddenly being forced to be on my own  led me to do some serious soul searching, and I realized that I was tired of the life Id been living.I was tired of being me.I didnt want to be the guy who was known for stomping on someones head after they were already on the ground, I wanted to be known as a friend, a guy you could count on.Or at the very least, a guy with some kind of future ahead of him.So I stopped partying and I channeled all my energy into training and going to school and working instead.Just like that?It wasnt quite as easy as it sounds, but yeah just like that.People dont usually change.I didnt have a choice.Still  Dont get the wrong idea.Im not trying to make excuses for what I did.Regardless of what the doctors said about whether or not I could actually control my behavior, I knew I was messed up, and I didnt give a damn about getting better.Instead, I smoked pot and drank and trashed my parents house and wrecked cars and I got arrested over and over for fighting.For a long time, I just didnt care about anything other than partying the way I wanted to.And now you care?I care a lot.And I dont have any intention of going back to my old life.He felt her eyes on him, and sensed her trying to reconcile the past hed described with the man before her.I can understand the anger disorder, but PTSD?Yes.What happened?Do you really want to hear this?Its kind of a long story.When she nodded, he went on.Like I told you, I was a bit of a problem child, and by the time I was eleven, I was pretty much uncontrollable.In the end, my parents shipped me off to military school, and the first one I attended was just a bad place.There was this weird Lord of the Flies mentality among the upperclassmen, especially when someone new arrived.At first, it was little things  typical hazing kind of stuff, like taking my milk or dessert in the cafeteria, or making me shine their shoes or make their beds while another guy went over and trashed my room, which Id have to clean before inspection.No big deal  every newbie goes through that kind of stuff.But some of these guys were different just sadistic.Theyd whip me with wet towels after I showered, or theyd sneak up behind me while I was studying and throw a blanket over me, and just start beating the crap out of me.After a while, they started to do that at night, when I was sleeping.Back then, I was kind of small for my age, and I made the mistake of crying a lot, which only amped them up even more.Its like I became their special project.Theyd come for me two or three nights a week, always with the blanket, always with the punches, just beating the crap out of me while telling me that Id be dead before the year was up.I was pretty freaked out, on edge all the time.I would try to stay awake and flinch at the slightest noise, but its not like I could avoid sleeping.Theyd bide their time and wait until I was out.That kind of crap went on for months.I still have nightmares about it.Did you tell anyone?Of course I did.I told everyone I could.I told the commander, my teachers, the counselor, even my parents.None of them believed me.They kept telling me to stop lying and whining and just toughen up.Thats awful   No question.I was just a little kid, but after a while, I figured I had to get out of there, or theyd take it too far one day, so I ended up taking matters into my own hands.I smuggled in some spray paint and went to town in the administration building.I ended up getting kicked out, which was exactly what I wanted.He drew a long breath.Anyway, they ended up closing the school a couple of years later, after the local paper did an expos on the place.A kid died there.A little kid, my age.I wasnt one of the students mentioned in the expos, but it was national news for a while.Criminal and civil charges, the whole works.Some people ended up in prison over it.And my parents felt terrible after that, because they hadnt believed me.I think thats why they put up with me for so long after I graduated.Because they still felt guilty.So after you were expelled  I went to another military school and swore to myself that Id never let myself get beaten up again.In the future, Id be the one throwing the first punch.So I learned to fight.I studied it, practiced it.And after that, if someone ever grabbed me, Id just lose it.It was like I was a little kid again.I got expelled over and over, barely made it through, and after I graduated, it sort of snowballed from there.Like I said, I used to be pretty messed up.He took a few steps in silence.Anyway, all that came into play during the court proceedings.How do you get along with your parents right now?Like my sisters, its a work in progress.Right now, they have a restraining order against me.A stunned expression crossed her face and he went on.I was arguing with my parents the night before I went to Arizona and I ended up pinning my dad against the wall.I wasnt going to hurt him and I kept telling him that  I just wanted them to listen to me  but it scared the hell out of my parents.They didnt press charges  or I wouldnt be here  but they did get a court order that prohibits me from being at their house.They dont necessarily enforce it now, but its still in place, probably to keep me from ever thinking about moving back in.She studied him.I still dont understand how you can just change.I mean, what if you get angry again?I still get angry.Everyone does.But Ive learned different ways to cope with it.Like not going to bars or doing drugs, and I never have more than a couple of beers when Im with my friends.And being really physical every day  training hard, pushing myself  helps keep my moods in check.I also learned a lot of helpful things at the hospital, different ways to cope.The whole experience ended up being one of the better things Ive ever done.What did you learn there?Deep breathing, walking away, letting thoughts bounce off, or trying to accurately name the emotion when it strikes in the hopes of diminishing its power its not easy, but it becomes a habit after a while.It takes a lot of effort and a lot of conscious thought, but if I wasnt doing all of these things, Id probably have to go back on lithium, and I hate that crap.Its a good drug for a lot of people and it works, but I just didnt feel like myself when I used to take it.It was like part of me wasnt quite alive.And I was always starving, no matter how much I ate.I ended up gaining weight, getting fat.Id rather train a few hours a day, do yoga, meditate, and avoid places where I might get into trouble.Is it working?So far, he answered.I just take it one day at a time.As they walked farther down the beach, the music gradually faded beneath the sound of waves rolling up the shore.Beyond the dunes, businesses had given way to houses, lights glowing through the windows.The moon had risen higher, bathing the world in an ethereal glow.Ghost crabs scuttled from one spot to the next, scurrying at their slow approach.Youre very open about all of this, Maria observed.Im just answering your questions.Arent you worried what I might think?Not really.You dont care what other people think about you?To a certain extent I do.Everyone does.But if youre going to make a judgment about me, then you need to know who I really am, not just the part I decide to tell you.Id rather be honest about all of it and let you make the call as to whether you want to keep talking to me or not.Have you always been like this?She peered up at him with genuine curiosity.What do you mean?Honest?About everything?No, he said.That came about after I got back from the hospital.Along with all the other changes I decided to make in my life.How do people react to it?Most dont know what to make of it.Especially at first.Evan still doesnt.And I dont think you do, either.But its still important to me to be truthful.Especially with friends, or someone I think I might see again.Is that why you told me?Because you think you might see me again?Yes, he answered.For a few seconds, she wasnt sure what to make of that.Youre an interesting man, Colin, she said.Its been an interesting life, he admitted.But youre interesting, too.Trust me, compared to you, Im the furthest thing from interesting.Maybe.Maybe not.But you havent run away yet.I still might.Youre kind of scary.No, Im not.For a girl like me?Believe me, youre a little scary.This is probably the first time Ive ever spent an evening with a guy who talks about stomping on peoples heads in bar fights or pinning his father against the wall.Or has been arrested.Or went to a psychiatric facility  Those things, too.And?She brushed at a few windblown strands of hair.Im still deciding.Right now, I have no idea what to think about everything youve said.But if I suddenly take off running, dont try to catch me, okay?Fair enough.Did you tell any of this to Serena?No, he said.Unlike you, she didnt ask.But would you have?Probably.Of course you would.How about we talk about you instead?Would that make you feel better?She cracked a wry smile.Theres not much to tell.I told you a little about my family; you know I grew up here and went to UNC and Duke Law School, and that I work as a lawyer.My past isnt quite as colorful as yours.Thats a good thing, he said.Somehow already on the same wavelength, they turned simultaneously and started back.Okay, she said, and when he laughed, she stopped for a moment, suddenly wincing.Reaching for his arm to steady herself, she lifted one foot from the sand.Give me a second here.My sandals are killing me.He watched as she slipped them off.When she finally let go of his arm, he felt the lingering afterglow of her touch.Better, she said.Thanks.They began walking again, more slowly this time.On the roof at Crabby Petes, the crowd was growing, and he suspected that other bars were filling up as well.Above them, most of the stars had been washed away by moonlight.In the easy silence, he found himself admiring her features: her cheekbones and her full lips, the sweep of her lashes against her flawless skin.Youre very quiet, he observed.Im just trying to digest everything you told me.Its a lot.No question, he agreed.I will say that youre different.In what way?Before I took a job here, I was an assistant district attorney in Charlotte.No kidding?A little over three years.It was my first job after I passed the bar.So you were more used to prosecuting guys like me than dating them?She half nodded in agreement, but went on.Its more than that.Most people pick and choose the way they tell their stories.Theres always a positive bias involved, and they frame the stories that way, but you Youre so objective, its almost like youre describing someone else.Sometimes it feels that way to me, too.I dont know if I could do that.Frowning, she went on.Actually, I dont know if I want to do that, at least to the extent that you do.You sound like Evan.He smiled.How did you like working in the DAs office?In the beginning it was all right.And the whole thing was a great learning experience.But after a while, I realized it wasnt what I thought it would be.Like taking a walk with me?Kind of she said.When I was in law school, I thought that being in a courtroom would be more like the stuff you watch on TV.I mean, I knew it would be different, but I wasnt prepared for just how different it actually was.To me, it seemed like I was going after the same person, with the same background, over and over.The DA would take the higher profile cases, but the suspects I dealt with were like walking clichs; they were usually poor and unemployed with limited education, and drugs and alcohol were usually involved.And it was just relentless.There were so many cases.I used to dread coming in on Monday mornings because I knew what would be waiting for me on my desk.The sheer volume put me in the position of having to prioritize the cases and continually negotiate plea bargains.We all know that murder and attempted murder or crimes with guns are serious, but how do you prioritize the rest of it?Is a guy who steals a car worse than a guy who broke into someones house and stole jewelry?And how do either of those compare to a secretary who embezzles from her company?But theres only so much room on the court docket; theres only so much space available in prison.Even when the rare case did go to trial, its not what you know happened, its what you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and thats where it gets even trickier.The public believes we have unlimited resources to prosecute, with advanced forensic capabilities and expert witnesses at the ready, but thats just not the way it is.Matching DNA can take months, unless its a high profile crime.Witnesses are notoriously inconsistent.Evidence is ambiguous.And again, there are just too many cases even if I wanted to really delve into a particular crime, Id have to neglect all those other files waiting on my desk.So more often than not, the pragmatic thing was to simply work something out with opposing counsel, where the subject pled to a lesser offense.She kicked at the sand, her footsteps dragging.I was constantly being put into situations where people expected results that I couldnt deliver, and Id end up being the bad guy.In their minds, the suspects had committed a crime and they should be held accountable, which to the victims almost always meant prison time or restitution of some sort, but that just wasnt possible.Afterwards, the arresting officers werent happy, the victims werent happy, and I felt like I was letting them down.And in a way, I was.Eventually I realized that I was just a cog in the wheel of this giant, broken machine.She slowed, pulling her sweater tighter around her.Theres just evil out there.You wouldnt believe the cases that would reach our office.A mom prostituting her six year old daughter to buy drugs, or a man raping a ninety year old woman.Its enough to make you lose faith in humanity.And because theres this great burden on you to go hard after the really horrible suspects, that means that other perpetrators dont get the punishment they deserve and end up back on the streets.And sometimes She shook her head.Anyway, by the end of my time there, I was barely sleeping and I started getting these weird panic attacks when I was at work.I walked in one morning and just knew I couldnt do it anymore.So I went to my bosss office and resigned.I didnt even have another job lined up.It sounds to me like your job was draining in a lot of different ways.It was.She smiled grimly, a spectrum of conflicting emotions playing across her face.And?And what?Want to talk about it?Talk about what?The real reason you quit?The part that led to you having panic attacks?Startled, she turned toward him.How would you know about that?I dont, he said.But if youd been there for a while, something specific must have happened.Something bad.And Im guessing it concerned a case, right?She stopped walking, turning to face the water.The moonlit shadows accentuated her expression  a mixture of sadness and guilt that brought with it a fleeting ache he hadnt expected.Youre very intuitive.She closed her eyes, holding them that way for a moment.I cant believe Im about to tell you this.Colin said nothing.By then, theyd almost reached the spot where theyd entered the beach, a cacophony of music audible now above the sound of the waves.She gestured toward the dune.Do you mind if we sit?Not at all.Slipping off her purse and setting her sandals aside, she lowered herself to the sand.Colin made himself comfortable beside her.Cassie Manning, Maria offered.That was her name I hardly ever talk about her.Its not something that I like reliving.Her voice was tight and controlled.The case came to me maybe three or four months after Id begun working at the DAs office.On paper, it struck me as a fairly typical case.Cassie is dating a guy and they get into an argument, it escalates, and the guy ends up getting violent.Cassie ends up in the hospital with a black eye and a split lip, bruising, a cracked cheekbone.In other words, it wasnt just one punch; it was a beating.His name was Gerald Laws.Laws?Ive tried to find the irony, but Ive never found any.And nothing about the case ended up being typical in the slightest.It turns out that theyd been dating for six months or so, and in the beginning of the relationship, Cassie found Laws utterly charming.He listened well, opened doors for her  a gentleman  but after a while, she began to notice aspects of his personality that concerned her.The longer they dated, the more jealous and possessive he started to become.Cassie told me that he began to get angry if she didnt answer immediately when he called her; he started showing up at her office when she was getting off work  she was a nurse at a pediatric office  and once, when she was having lunch with her brother, she spotted Laws on the other side of the restaurant, all by himself, just watching her.She knew that hed followed her there and it bothered her.The next time he called, Cassie told him that she wanted to take a break for a while.He agreed, but soon thereafter, she realized that he was stalking her.Shed see him at the post office or when she was leaving the doctors office or when she was jogging, and shed get these calls where no one would talk on the other end.Then, one night, Laws showed up at her door saying that he wanted to apologize, and against her better judgment, she let him in.Once inside, he tried to convince her to go out with him again.When she said no, he grabbed her arm and she began to fight back, and she ended up hitting him with a vase.After that, he threw her to the floor and just went at it.It happened that there was a police officer the next street over, and after the 911 call came in  the neighbors had heard screaming  he was at the house in minutes.Laws had her pinned to the floor and was punching her and there was blood everywhere.It turned out later that it was his blood from a cut over his ear where shed hit him with the vase.The officer had to use a Taser on him.When they searched his car, they found duct tape, rope, a couple of knives, and videotaping equipment.Scary stuff.When I talked to Cassie, she told me that the guy was crazy and that she was afraid for her life.Her family was, too.Her mom and dad and her younger brother were adamant that Laws be put away for as long as possible.She burrowed her toes in the sand.I thought so, too.In my mind, there was no question that the guy needed to be put away.It was also pretty open and shut as far as cases go.In North Carolina, Laws could have been charged with either a Class C felony, which means he had the intent to kill her, or a Class E felony, where he didnt have the intent to kill her.
