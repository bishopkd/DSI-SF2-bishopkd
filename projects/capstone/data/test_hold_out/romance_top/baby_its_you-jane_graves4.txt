The problem was that he couldnt forget how that guy had grabbed her arm.If hed do that in a public place with other people looking on, what would he do in private?Marc knew that kind of guy.It wasnt a matter of if.It was a matter of when, and just the thought of it made anger slither up his spine.Thinking about it, if she went home to Houston now, anything might happen.She just wasnt strong enough yet to haul off and kick the guy where it would hurt the most.Marc was glad hed chased that asshole out of town, and if he had the opportunity, hed do it all over again.But that wasnt all.Even now in the midst of this crazy situation, he couldnt keep his gaze from wandering places it shouldnt.To her red hair spilling over her shoulders in long, loose waves.To the outline of her breasts against the thin fabric of the dress she wore.To those gorgeous green eyes that were turning him into a spineless moron.Even though the word no formed inside his head, he just couldnt get it to come out of his mouth.It was official.He was a sap.A gutless, pathetic sap who couldnt even utter a simple two letter word.Okay, he said on a sigh of resignation.You can stay.Her eyebrows flew up.I can?Then she smiled.Wow.That was easier than I thought it would be.Dont get cocky.Its only until you get a deposit together to rent an apartment.Or wash out of your job.Whichever comes first.The deposit will come first.I already called Rosie to tell her I was taking the job after all.Marc grabbed her two biggest suitcases.Well see how it goes.He started down the path toward the cottage.Kari put her dog down, pulled up the handles on her two smaller suitcases, and hurried after him.Im going to pay you back, she said.I dont know how exactly, but Im going to.Maybe I can help you with your harvest.You said you needed somebody to help pick grapes.That sounds like fun.Fun?Good God, she had no idea what she was saying.Picking grapes was hard, dirty, sticky, sweaty work that even strong, healthy men had a hard time with, and she was about as substantial as dandelion fluff.Well talk about that when the time comes, he said.But the truth was that the time wasnt going to come.He hadnt been joking when he told her he expected her to wash out of her job at Rosies.If she lasted past the first day it would be a miracle.But that would mean shed no longer have a job, and when that happened, what in the world was he going to do with her then?Hes letting you stay.Those words echoed over and over in Karis mind, but she could still scarcely believe them.There was definitely something to be said for the boat burning thing.They circled the house, and when the cottage came into view, Kari was sure shed ended up in Disney World by mistake.It looked like a miniature prairie style house with wooden steps leading to a wide front porch.The clapboard siding was painted a cheery peach color that made her happy just to look at it.What a cute place!Kari said.Its orange, Marc said.I hate orange.No, Kari said.Its peach.Thats what Nina said, too, but youre both wrong.Its orange.So whyd you paint it this color if you hate it?Nina insisted.She says I have no color sense.I have color sense.Every time I see orange, I sense that its an ugly color.What color did you want to paint it?White.Oh.White is nice.No, it wasnt.White was boring.Ugly.Utilitarian.Only people with zero imagination painted anything white.But telling Marc his sister was right and he was wrong probably wouldnt be well received.They climbed the porch steps, and Marc pulled his keys from his pocket and opened the door.He set the luggage down inside, then grabbed the two suitcases Kari was struggling with and put them beside the others.She looked around and couldnt help smiling.It was as if shed stepped back in time twenty years.Along one wall sat a flowered sofa that was paired with a rattan coffee table, with a bean pot lamp sitting on an end table next to it.A kitchenette lined one wall, with Formica counters and white appliances.The place was definitely dated, and there was a layer of dust on everything, but it was cute nonetheless.And definitely better than sleeping in the street.Boo ran in circles, sniffing and yapping in a dizzying dance of sheer delight.Marcs dog tried galloping after him.Brandy!The dog made an about face and hurried back to Marcs side, her head ducked, looking properly chastised even though she still quivered with excitement.Finally Kari intercepted Boo and scooped him up.What is that thing, anyway?Marc asked, nodding at Boo.What do you mean, what is it?Its a dog.No, he said, pointing to Brandy.Thats a dog.He pointed to Boo.That looks like a bad toupee.Hes a cairn terrier.Well, most of him is, anyway.Exactly how destructive is he?Uh oh.Destructive?Does he tear things up?She lifted her chin.Ill have you know Boo went to Canine Cotillion, the finest obedience school in Houston.He was a standout student.The instructor said hed never had a pupil like him.When we were at Rosies and you were in the ladies room, he grabbed a french fry right off your plate.I guess he missed the class on table manners.Once he settles in, hell be fine.From the look on Marcs face, he clearly didnt believe that.Frankly, Kari didnt believe it, either.What she hadnt told Marc was that Boo was a standout student at Canine Cotillion because he was deaf to every command the instructor tried to teach him.Kari held out hope that Boo might eventually graduate, right up to the moment he peed on the guys shoe.After that, she just accepted the fact that Boo was going to be a sweet, loving, door pawing, shoe destroying, inappropriately barking dog for the rest of his life.There are some canned goods and other nonperishables in the pantry, Marc said.Help yourself to them.They should tide you over for several days.Okay.Thanks.There are a few cans of dog food, too.She nodded.Well, Marc said, crossing his arms.I guess you did it.You talked me into letting you stay in the cottage.Yes.And it felt so good.And you have a job.Thats right.Question, Marc said.Yes?How are you going to get to work?Her brain froze.What?When its time to go to work in the morning, what are you going to do?Kari blinked, stunned at the question.Oh, crap.The vineyard was miles from town.Miles.Shed already determined that walking there would likely kill her.Even a bicycle was out of the question.There was a reason they called this the Texas Hill Country, and she wasnt exactly in tip top physical condition.As full of herself as shed felt before, that was how deflated she felt now.WellIm not sure, she said.That wasnt part of your plan?She shrugged weakly.Well, I guess I thought maybe  Maybe what?Well, okay.Actually, I didnt think.But you go to town every day, right?Nope.But you were in town this morning.At your shop?Yes.But I just make deliveries now and then with no particular schedule.Nina runs it.Oh.She stared at Marc, dropping her chin and peering up at him like a puppy whod peed in the corner, thinking maybe if she looked pathetic enough hed take pity on her.Unfortunately, she was looking for pity from a man who, by all indications, had very little of it to give.Any ideas?Marc said.Damn it.One glitch.One stupid, stinking glitch and her whole plan was coming unraveled.Dont worry, Marc said.I have a solution.Kari brightened.You do?Yes.I have a car you can drive.But you wont like it.In fact, the moment you see it, you may decide to get back on that bus after all.No!I will!Ill drive anything thatll get me there.Anything!Okay, then.Come with me.They left the cottage, and Kari followed Marc toward the barn.They went around to the side of it, where a tractor was parked, along with something that had the appearance of a car.If not for the four tires, though, identification might have been impossible.This, Marc said, is the Bomb.Kari winced.The Bomb?Its a 1989 Vista Cruiser nine passenger station wagon.Kari thought about her cute little Lexus that was dead on arrival and felt a stab of longing.This had to be a test.Marc was offering her the most noxious vehicle on the planet just to see if shed turn tail and run.She walked closer, feeling as if she was approaching a pile of toxic waste.Whats that stuff peeling off the sides?she asked.Fake wood grain.Its like contact paper only crappier.What color did it used to be before the rust ate it up?As I remember, it was blue.Thats the biggest car Ive ever seen.Yeah.When it was new, Car and Driver named it the safest car on the road.A train could hit it and the only thing damaged would be the train.For sheer safety, nothing beats this baby.He gave it a hearty pat on the fender.Which is why it was the only car I ever let my daughter drive.Kari looked horrified.You inflicted this disgusting thing on her?What did the other kids say?They laughed their asses off.My God.Your poor daughter.Theres no use giving a teenager a decent car.Theyll just back it into something and tear it up.He paused.Or swerve to miss a deer and wrap it around a tree.Funny.Angela bought a new used one when she went to college.I told her Id match whatever she saved.She saved, I matched.Thank God.If shed had to drive this one to college, shed have probably stayed home.Going against the crowd builds character.Why do you call it the Bomb?That makes me a little nervous.Angela called it that.She swore it was such a mess it was going to explode.So thats possible?It might actually explode?Nah, Marc said.Its way more likely that the engine will overheat or the starter will go out.What do I do if it does?Call me.That way when you have to walk home, I wont wonder where you are.How sweet.She looked back at the car.Youre serious about this, arent you?Deadly.Youre sure it runs?Like a top.Too bad it doesnt run like a car.With that, Marc tossed her the keys.She caught them midair.It has a full tank of gas, Marc said.That should hold you until you can afford to put gas in it yourself.He nodded over his shoulder.Come with me.I want you to meet the guys who work here.They need to know who you are so they dont wonder why a strange woman is wandering around.He took her down a path to a big metal warehouse like structure he referred to as the barn.Inside she saw barrel after barrel stacked almost to the ceiling, along with shiny stainless steel equipment with all kinds of hoses sticking out of it.Two men stopped what they were doing and walked over.One was a Mexican man who looked to be in his late fifties who Marc introduced as Ramon, and the other was a tall, gangly, thirty something guy named Michael who wore a Rangers baseball cap and iPod earbuds.This is Kari, Marc said.Shes going to be staying in the cottage for a few weeks.Kari reached out to shake their hands, only to have them smile and hold up their dirty palms.Michael and Ramon are the only employees on site right now, Marc said.The three of us handle the work for part of the year, and then I have contract guys who come in for pruning and harvest and some of the spring prep.About all were doing now is staying ahead of insect infestation and getting the equipment ready for crush and fermentation.Crush?After the grapes are picked and destemmed, a machine splits the skins to let the juice escape.Kari smiled.Like Lucy Ricardo stomping the grapes?Thats how it used to be done.We have a machine for that now, thank God.Darn.I was looking forward to hiking up my skirt and getting purple feet.Ramon smiled.Ah.A traditional woman.I like that.Anything for the cause, Kari said, appreciating Ramons smile since Marc didnt seem to have any of his own to offer.Ramon and Michael went back to work, and Marc led Kari out of the building.Feel free to walk around the vineyard, he told her.But dont distract the guys.They have work to do.And keep the rag mop close.There are coyotes and bobcats out here.Okay, shed never thought about the wildlife.Poor Boo wouldnt stand a chance against a house cat, much less a bobcat.Marc pulled his phone from his pocket, poked around on it for a moment, then put it away again.I have work to do, he told her.Let me know if you have any problems at the cottage.Keep the place clean, and turn the lights off when youre not there.No sense wasting electricity.With that, he turned and walked away.Shed hoped maybe he wasnt going to act totally like a landlord, that he might even invite her to dinner at the Big House.Unfortunately, no invitation seemed to be forthcoming.A little disappointed, Kari went back to the cottage.She tossed the keys to the Bomb on the dresser, then looked in the pantry.She saw five cans of pork and beans, three cans of corn, six boxes of macaroni and cheese, and a box of granola bars.That was what she had to eat between now and the time she could get a discounted lunch at Rosies or buy a few groceries for herself.She sighed.It beat nothing.Barely.Next she opened her suitcases and put her clothes away.She had enough basic personal care stuff with her to hold her for a while, and she had plenty of clothes and shoes since she always overpacked.Unfortunately, none of them were terribly practical for work, but theyd have to do until she could afford to buy more.She looked at her phone.She had only a few weeks left before shed be getting a bill for next months service.Since she couldnt imagine being without her phone, shed have to find a way to pay the bill even if she didnt eat.A short time later, she was settled in, feeling pretty good about things.But as it grew later, she got just a little bit scared.Yeah, shed managed to tell Greg she didnt want to go back to Houston with him, but that was because shed had a very large, very intimidating man backing her up.And shed also succeeded at getting a job, but probably the only reason Rosie had hired her was because she said she was a friend of Marcs.She had a place to live and food to eat, but againMarc.And hed told her point blank he expected her to fail.She scooped Boo up and cuddled him against her.She had to make this work.If she didnt, shed be back in Houston.Without Marc.Later, as evening fell over the cottage, she glanced out the window and saw Marc on his deck, holding a glass of wine, staring out over the vineyard.Something about the way he stood there, strong and tall, made her breath catch in her throat.Then he sat down in one of the Adirondack chairs on the deck.Brandy came and lay beside him.He pulled out his phone, poked around on it, looked up at the sky, poked a little more, then put it away.Then he picked up his wineglass again and watched as the sun slipped below the horizon.When Kari finally closed the blinds, she realized her heart was racing.What was it about Marc that made her insides melt?She could watch him twenty four hours a day and still it wouldnt be enough.Then her gaze wandered to a photograph on the top of the dresser.It was of Marc and a teenage girl who had to be his daughter.Marc was sitting down, and his daughter stood behind him, leaning over with her arms wrapped around his neck.She was smiling.So was Marc.So there it was.Proof positive hed smiled at least once in the past, and it elevated his handsome face into another realm entirely.Just the sight of it touched something inside Kari, something she tried not to think about.Since her own mothers death when she was eight years old, shed felt so alone.No hugs, no smiles, nothing.Her father had filled her life with nothing but rules and regimentation, and just about the only time he spoke to her was to tell her she was doing something wrong.Christmases came and went with opulent gifts, elaborate dinners prepared by staff, and then her father retiring to his study as soon as it was all over because work couldnt wait, even on holidays.Any attention she received came from nannies, but bonding with any of them had been a lost cause.She remembered one in particular shed loved, a twenty something woman whod worked for families whod traveled overseas and had endless stories about museums in Paris and skiing in Switzerland and camera safaris in Africa.But shed been a little too cheerful and flamboyant for her fathers taste, and hed sent her packing, replacing her with a woman who smiled even less than her father and kept schedules like a train conductor.Kari quickly learned not to show off any accomplishments, because they were never enough.Unfortunately, big accomplishments had never been her forte.After all, she hadnt had the lead in the school play in the seventh grade, she hadnt graduated valedictorian, and she hadnt gotten into an Ivy League school.Then Greg came along, a younger version of her father, another man in her life who didnt love her as much as he tolerated her.And now Jill had turned on her, telling her how dumb she was not to marry Greg, when it should have been obvious to anyone close to her that it would only make her miserable.Sometimes Kari had the feeling that the only deep, abiding love she was destined to feel in this life had died the day her mother had.She looked back at the photo, at Marcs beautiful daughter and his warm, genuine smile, and she felt a shot of envy so powerful she had to close her eyes to block out the feeling.There was no doubt in Karis mind that this girl knew what it was like to be loved.Kari set the photo back onto the dresser, clicked the lamp off, and lay down.She closed her eyes.Soon she was on the edge of sleep, and weird, dreamy, nonsensical images swirled through her mind.She saw a lost, barefoot damsel in distress, wandering through a vineyard wearing a poufy white dress, desperate for a glimpse of her hero.Then she heard hoof beats in the distance.After a moment her white knight appeared, big and strong and powerful.As he galloped toward her, she felt his all encompassing, everlasting love wash over her with a certainty that left her breathless.And as he swept her onto his trusty steed, he was smiling.7    Dragging out of bed at 6:00 a. m.  the next morning was a killer, but Kari was determined to be on time for her first day of work.She showered, dressed, ate another granola bar, and begged Boo not to pee all over the cottage while she was gone.Kari had underestimated exactly how bad driving the Bomb was going to be.The headliner had come loose over the drivers seat.It sat on top of her head, getting little pieces of whatever a headliner was made of in her hair.The radio didnt work.The car smelled like a hundred year old coffin that had been pried open.About once every quarter mile, the car gave a little lurch that made it seem as if the engine was going to die, but it never did.She arrived at Rosies with three minutes to spare.Parking the Bomb was like docking the Queen Mary, but she wedged it into a space behind the caf and went inside.Rosie greeted her with a W 9 form, an application to fill out, and a pink bib apron that read, Pets Welcome, People Tolerated.After Kari filled out the paperwork, Rosie introduced her to one of the other waitresses.Gloria was a dark haired woman who looked to be about Karis age, whose engaging smile and easy manner made Karis apprehension start to melt away.Ever wait tables before?Gloria asked.No, Kari said.Doesnt matter.Im sure youll pick things up fast.Then another woman came through the kitchen door into the restaurant wearing skintight jeans, an equally skintight baby tee, and a Rosies Caf apron.She was tall and solid with a pouf of Texas big hair, and she wore so much mascara Kari was surprised she could keep her eyes open.Morning girls, the woman said, circling around the counter to pour herself a Diet Coke.How was your weekend?Waitnever mind.Let me tell you about mine.I went out with Hank Waddell.Only we didnt go out.We stayed in.And whew!That man will wear a woman out.She stopped short and looked at Kari, her face falling into a frown.Who are you?Kari Worthington, she said with a smile and stuck her hand out.This is my first day.The woman ignored Karis hand.So have you ever waited tables before?No, Kari said, letting her hand fall self consciously back to her side.This is my first job as a waitress.Its harder than you think.Youre wearing sandals.Whats with that?Its all I have right now.By the end of your shift, your feet are going to be killing you.Youll have blisters on top of your blisters.But hey, its your funeral.As the woman sauntered off, all of Karis prior apprehension returned with even more heaped on top.She turned to Gloria.Who was that?Bobbie Arnette.Gloria sighed and lowered her voice.She can be kinda mean.But shes a good waitress, so Rosie keeps her around.Flirts with every guy who walks into the place.Most people dont know what shes really like, so she makes more tips than the rest of us put together.You probably ought to just try to stay out of her way.Okay, girls, Rosie said.Sheila called in sick.That means each of you is going to have to take a couple of extra tables.More work, but more money.She turned to Kari.I want you to follow Gloria around for the morning shift.If youre picking things up, I want you to take a couple of your own tables at lunch.Kari felt a shot of apprehension.Uhokay.Yeah.I can do that.Gloria showed Kari the order pads, took her to meet the kitchen staff, and gave her the lowdown on as many procedures as she could.Gloria also introduced her to Marla, a gnarled little woman who was approximately 120 years old.Shed been the hostess at the caf long before Rosie had bought it, and shed probably die behind that faux walnut hostess stand.Gloria told Kari that when Marla finally passed, theyd probably put her ashes on a shelf behind the counter so she could spend eternity there, even though it seemed as if she already had.Then came the customers.As they streamed through the door, Gloria stopped her tutorial and said, Follow me, and keep your eyes and ears open.Kari couldnt believe what happened over the next two hours.Shadowing Gloria was like trying to follow a herding dog as he was rounding up a flock of sheep.She shot left and right, from one table to another, then to the cash register, then to the kitchen and back again.Dog biscuits here, high chairs there, more coffee, endless plates and baskets of food, and directions to the bathroom.Before long, Karis back hurt, her feet were on fire, and she was sweating right through her shirt.She wasnt sure she could remember a single bit of the advice Gloria shared with her along the way.How long does it usually stay busy at breakfast?Kari asked, shoving a stray lock of hair out of her eyes.Right on into lunch, Gloria said.Kari groaned inwardly.As the lunch rush geared up, Rosie told her to take one of the smaller stations in the restaurant with only three tables.But to Kari, it seemed like three hundred.She waited on a family of four.She got three of their orders right.One of the kids ended up with a grilled chicken sandwich instead of chicken nuggets, and she had to put the order in again.She wanted to tell the parents that fried stuff wasnt good for the kid anyway and she was doing him a favor by bringing something grilled, but she didnt think that would go over too well.Then one of her customers called her over.How about that chicken fried steak?Its been twenty minutes.Chicken fried steak?Oh, God.Had she even put that order in?Soon everything was a blur.The orders, the plates of food, the cooks slinging hamburger patties and sandwich fixings and french fries, and the whole time she felt either Bobbie watching her, waiting for her to screw up, or Rosie watching her when she did screw up.Later in the shift, Marla led two men to one of Karis tables.They were young, attractive, and wore no wedding rings.Bobbie instantly came to attention.Whoa, mama, she said, eyeing the two men.That tables mine.Kari blinked with surprise.I thoughtisnt that my station?Hmm.Im afraid youre mistaken about that.But youre new, so thats probably why youre confused.As Bobbie sashayed off to sidle up next to the men, Kari and Gloria went into the kitchen.Whats she doing taking a table in your station?Gloria asked.Its okay.It would have overloaded me.But its your table.She shouldnt hijack you like that.A few moments later, Bobbie came into the kitchen.Bobbie, Gloria said.You just took one of Karis tables.She was moving too slow.It would have been next week before they got their food.Shes new.Those guys would have cut her some slack.Nobody should have to cut anybody any slack around here.She looked at Kari.You got two choices.Get moving or get lost.She grabbed two burger baskets from under the warming lights and flounced out of the kitchen.I cant believe she just said that, Kari said.She acts as if she owns the place.I know.Shes awful.If shes so awful, why doesnt Rosie do something about her?Rosie likes her people to fight their own battles, as long as they dont do it in front of customers.She says thats the only way problems stay fixed for good.It sounded to Kari as if Rosie could use a good human resources director, but it wasnt her place to say so.Next, Kari waited on a man with glasses and dirty blond hair who looked to be in his late thirties.A camera sat in the seat beside him.He said he was an amateur photographer, and hed heard Rainbow Valley was very picturesque.Like every other tourist who came in there, he seemed particularly interested in the apron Kari wore.He asked to take her picture, which meant she had to fake a smile, and it just about broke her face.Unfortunately, he also wanted to talk.How long have you lived in Rainbow Valley?Where are you from originally?How long have you worked here?Do you like it?She couldnt be rude, but every moment she spent making small talk was a moment she wasnt getting her work done.Kari had two orders come up at once.Because she couldnt remember which order shed put in first, she decided to take both.She grabbed two of the plates and balanced them on her forearms the way shed seen the other waitresses do, and held two more in her hands.If she could carry twice as much food at once, shed get things to tables faster and keep her customers happy.Then maybe shed get more than pocket change for tips.She headed for the kitchen door, feeling perfectly balanced and right on top of things.She turned ninety degrees to edge the door open, only to have it open the other way and smack her in the hip.The baskets slipped out of her hands and went flying.They hit the ground, bouncing their contents into the air about the time she twirled around and landed facedown on top of them, her forehead smacking against the floor.Her first thought was that somebody had come in the Out door.But when she turned over and sat up, she realized shed tried to go out the In.And it was Bobbie whod been coming in.Jesus, Bobbie said.You broke my fingernail!I paid thirty bucks for that manicure!Im sorry, Kari said from the floor, hoping she didnt have brain damage.Always go to the right, Bobbie said in the snottiest voice imaginable.Good God.Were you raised in one of those wimpy countries where they drive on the left side of the road?Gloria came through the door, saw Kari on the floor, and hurried over to help her up.Kari!Oh, honey, are you okay?Yeah, Kari said, even though she wasnt.Her hip hurt and her head throbbed.She had ketchup and mustard on her apron, mingling with a smear of gravy.Gloria helped her to her feet.Kari swapped aprons and kept on working, but the whole time she felt as if she was going to cry.Finally when her shift was over, she sat down on one of the stools at the counter, every muscle in her body screeching with pain.Shed never been so tired in her life.Never.What had she been thinking when she took this job?Rosie sat down next to her.Remember how I said youd get the hang of the job?Yeah?I think maybe I spoke too soon.Kari felt a rush of apprehension.Look, I know I had some problems.But it was so busy today.Busier than usual, from what the other girls said.We have a lot of those days.And Bobbie  Bobbie can be a pain in the ass, but she gets the job done.Part of working here is learning how to deal with her, because I cant spend my whole day breaking up squabbles.Im your boss, not your mother.Kari looked down at her lap, feeling miserable, and Rosies face softened.Maybe Marc was right, sweetie.Maybe this wasnt such a good idea after all.I need this job.Rosie sighed.Why dont you think about it and give me a call later?But I gotta tell you.If you keep working here, its going to be an uphill battle.For both of us.Sometimes its just best to call it quits.With that, Rosie got up off the stool and circled around the counter to take a customers order.Kari stood up to take off her apron.Just the act of moving from the stool to her feet made her back muscles feel as if somebody had stabbed them with a red hot poker.What had she been thinking when shed taken this job?All the way back to the vineyard, she felt miserable.What was she supposed to do now?Rosie was right, of course.She wasnt cut out to wait tables.Now she was going to have to tell Marc she couldnt handle the job.Hed probably be happy about that.After all, hadnt he wanted her to get on that bus and leave town?Of course, the Bombs air conditioner didnt work, so by the time she got back to the vineyard, sweat was pouring down her temples and the back of her neck, plastering her hair against her skin.She pulled the car to a halt and killed the engine.Marc was down by the barn.She was going to have to go down there and tell him what had happened, but the thought of it made her sick to her stomach.If only she could have stuck it out.If only Bobbie hadnt been such a horrible bitch.If only every muscle in her body wasnt screaming with pain.She folded her arms on the steering wheel, rested her head there, and closed her eyes.How had she gotten herself into this mess?Taking a nap?Kari jerked her head up to find Marc standing by the drivers window.Had she actually fallen asleep?He opened the door.Damn it.That meant she had to get out.She swung her legs around and made an attempt to stand, but it took her three stabs at it before she finally came to her feet.A moan of pain started to come out of her mouth, but she gritted her teeth and kept it to herself.It wasnt remotely fair that he was hot and sweaty but looked gorgeous, while she was hot and sweaty and looked like roadkill.So how did your first day go?She glared at him.You seem to be a little sore.Im a lot sore.Dont worry.Itll get easier.No, it wont.Sure it will.Youre just not used to spending that much time on your feet.Kari said nothing.Youll be fine, he said.Trust me.Youre tougher than you think you are.Clearly he thought that just by speaking those words he could make them happen.Well, there was a whole lot more to this situation than just a little positive thinking.I made a mess of things, Kari said.Maybemaybe its best if I dont go back.Her words hung in the air for several seconds.Then Marc turned away and shook his head.What?she asked.So youre giving up right off the bat?Im not giving up.I just found out Im not cut out for waiting tables.Is there anything you are cut out for?Just because I havent found my niche yet doesnt mean  Your niche?Seriously?Youre not trying out a hobby, Kari.Youre working to support yourself.I know, but  So you quit?Kari hated this.Not yet.But youre going to.She was silent again.Well, I cant say Im surprised.Hey!You were the one who said how stupid it was that I was going to wait tables!No.I believe I told Rosie how wrong I thought it was for her to hire you.Looks as if I was right.He glanced at her feet.Why are you wearing shoes like that to wait tables?Its all I have.Theres most of your problem.You need sneakers.No kidding.So find a way to get some.Yeah.Ill reach into my magical suitcase.Theyre right next to the baby unicorns.Take this seriously and you might find a solution.Marc!Im dying here!So quit.Ill buy you another bus ticket, take you to the station, and you can go back to Houston and marry the asshole.There you go.Problem solved.With that, he turned around dismissively and strode back to the barn, leaving Kari feeling like the biggest loser alive.Damn you!You have no idea how I feel!She folded her arms and leaned against the car, feeling miserable.She hurt in places she didnt even know she had.She had no decent work shoes and no money to buy them with.The work was impossibly hard, and all she wanted to do was quit.But then what?All at once she realized shed done this all her life.Shed always told herself it was just because she saw something better on the horizon and didnt want to waste her time, but the truth was that when the going got tough, she quit.She quit the swim team in tenth grade because practice clashed with an afternoon TV show she wanted to watch.In college, as soon as a class got hard, she dropped it, which was why it took her five years to get a liberal arts degree.Shed run away from her own wedding because she hadnt had the backbone to call it off before she was sitting at the church in a wedding dress.Now she was running away from Rainbow Valley because she refused to stick it out in a job that was harder than shed anticipated.She hated the way Marc had looked at her.He thought she was as useless as Greg did.As her father did.As Rosie did.Was there anyone in this life who respected her?Even a little bit?She had the most gut wrenching feeling that the answer to that question was no.And that was the worst blow of all.The trouble was, if she quit this job, it meant she really was at rock bottom.What was she going to do then?Crawl back to her father and beg him to give her job back?That job that wasnt really a job at all, but simply a means her father used to allow him to call the shots?If she couldnt even handle this job, how was she supposed to get another one that didnt involve working for her father?Theyre right.All of them.You are useless.Shed known Marc all of two days, yet the fact that he was a good, dependable, honorable man was so crystal clear to her that shed have stated it under oath.And when hed turned his back on her and walked away, his disappointment still lingered in the very air she breathed.Oddly enough, of all the people in her life right now, he was the one whose respect she craved more than anything.With every minute that passed, that feeling ate away at her a little more, and pretty soon it hurt worse than her strained muscles and her pounding head, which meant there was only one thing she could do.She got into the Bomb and drove back to Rainbow Valley, ignoring the pain, ignoring the odds stacked against her, ignoring the fact that Rosie had essentially fired her but had been kind enough not to actually say the words.She parked in the lot behind the restaurant and came through the back door, trying not to look as if she could barely walk.Rosie was sitting at the counter poking at a laptop.Kari slid onto the stool beside her.Rosie sighed.Honey, what are you doing back here?You look like youre about to drop.Kari lifted her chin.Oh, God.My neck muscles!I need to talk to you.I thought things were settled.No.Things arent settled.I have something else I need to say.Talk fast, Rosie said.I have a lot of work to do before the dinner hour gears up.Kari swallowed hard and started in.I know you think Im a lousy waitress and that theres no hope Ill ever be a good one.I know Bobbie hates me, so theres that problem, too.But Im not quitting.Rosie raised an eyebrow.Is that right?Thats right.Im going to come into this place every single shift Im scheduled and try my damnedest to do a good job.And you can bet Im going to screw up.Im going to drop things.My tickets will be out of balance.Some of the customers will probably yell at me, and Ill earn zero tips.But Im not going to make it easy for you to get rid of me, because Im not going to quit.I am not going to quit.If you want me out of here, youre going to have to fire me.Rosie sighed and shook her head.Why are you doing this to me?Because I need this job.Part of life is knowing when to quit.Yeah, sometimes it is.But since I already know how to do that, now I need to learn how to keep going.Rosie stared at her a long time with a deadpan expression.Then she looked away, shaking her head.I cant afford to lose any more dishes.I know.The hourly wage sucks.If you dont make any tips, youd be better off rummaging through sofa cushions for loose change.I know that, too.No telling what Bobbies liable to do if you show up here tomorrow.Remember, I can only call the sheriff after shes committed assault and battery.I hear you.Rosie twisted her mouth with irritation.Youre not cut out for this, you know.I know.Rosie tapped her fingertips on the Formica counter, and Kari could almost feel her brain working.Then, with a heavy sigh, Rosie slid off her barstool.You got the six a. m.  to three p. m.  shift tomorrow.Dont be late.As Rosie strode into the kitchen, Kari felt as if shed voluntarily signed up for life in prison.But she still had a job.As she slid off the stool, the backs of her calves felt as if they were on fire.Ow.Ow.Ow.Ow!OW!She walked as delicately as she could to the back door and got into the Bomb.Coming back there tomorrow morning would likely be hell on earth all over again, but she was going to do it no matter what.If she dropped dead, so be it.At least shed die trying.She drove back to the vineyard, where she parked the Bomb.Then she walked resolutely up the steps to Marcs deck and knocked on his back door.Several seconds later, he answered.Before he could even open his mouth, she started in.Just so youll know, I went back to town.I talked to Rosie, and Im keeping my job.Marcs eyebrows rose.Is that right?Thats right.Its the worst job Ive ever had.I hurt in places I didnt even know existed.But even if it kills me, Im going back.So dont you ever again suggest that I should go back to Houston and marry Greg.No matter what I have to do, that is never going to happen.Do you understand?Yes, maam.I understand completely.Good.Now Im going to stumble back to the cottage, take a shower, and fall into a coma.If youll excuse me?She turned around and walked back down the steps, then headed down the path to the cottage.She let Boo out to run around the yard and pee, then went inside to sit down before she fell down.Then she saw tiny teeth marks in the legs of two of the wooden chairs at the dinette table.Great.That was just what she needed.Boo eating the cottage, one bite at a time.She rested for a minute, then went in to take a shower.It felt good, but not good enough.She put on a robe and collapsed on the sofa again.For the next hour, she watched a little TV, avoiding her ex favorite shows like Hells Kitchen or Restaurant: Impossible.People yelling at other people in restaurant kitchens just didnt hold the same entertainment value for her it had the day before.She still hadnt heard a word from her father.Not one.More than once since shed left Houston, shed imagined him telling her he understood why shed run and that he supported her decision not to marry Greg.When would she ever learn?When she was ten, shed fantasized that he would surprise her with a trip to Disney World, and hed ride Splash Mountain with her and not care if he got wet.When she was twelve, she imagined him sitting through her ballet recital, then telling her she was the next Anna Pavlova.When she was sixteen, she envisioned him coming to her soccer game and cheering when she made a goal.But if all those things had never happened, what made her think anything would change now?Then she heard a knock at her door.With a deep breath, she hoisted herself off the sofa and walked gingerly to the door.She opened it to find Marc on the porch.He brushed past her and came inside.He carried a big box, which he set down on the dinette table.What are you doing here?she asked.Youre going to have a hard time keeping that promise.What?To never quit your job.You cant expect to be successful at something if you dont have the proper tools.What are you talking about?He reached into the box.Firstibuprofen.Its an anti inflammatory, so itll take away the muscle pain.He grabbed a glass from a kitchen cabinet, filled it with water, and handed her two of the tablets.She stared at them dumbly.Kari.Take the pills.Marc  Take them.She took the pills and downed them as he reached into the box again.Your biggest problem is shoes, Marc said.What size do you wear?Six.Then these will be too big.He pulled a pair of raggedy sneakers out of the box and put them on the floor.But here are two pairs of socks.Wear both of them and the shoes will probably be okay.Whose shoes are they?she asked.Angelas.Your daughter?Youre giving me her shoes?Do you need them?She didnt know how to answer that without appearing helpless.But maybe it was just as bad to appear ungrateful.Yes.Then wear them.He pulled a heating pad from the box, which he plugged in and laid across the pillow at the end of the sofa.Your backs bound to hurt.Sit down and lean against that.She sat down, feeling like a Raggedy Ann that had gotten hit by a train.She turned and pulled her feet up on the sofa, resting her back against the pad.As it heated up, she couldnt believe what Marc pulled out of the box next.If her muscles werent ripped to shreds, shed have leapt off the sofa and grabbed it right out of his hand.Wine?she said.Yep.Natures anesthesia.He grabbed a wineglass from a kitchen cabinet, uncorked the bottle with a practiced twist and pull, and filled the glass.He handed it to her.Drink this.She sipped the wine.Oh, God.It filled her mouth with the most amazing flavor, and as she swallowed, she felt the soft burn all the way down her throat.Her body slumped as the wine went south, bringing on a sense of relaxation she certainly hadnt expected to feel tonight.Good wine, she said, sipping it again.Really good.Its our 2010 Cabernet.Our best vintage yet.Just the right amount of rain and sun that season.Most years were not that lucky.So luck plays a part?Its about the only thing you can count on.Not having any.Tough business?You dont know the half of it.Marc pulled out two more thingsBand Aids and triple antibiotic ointmentand put them on the coffee table.Then he sat down on the other end of the sofa.Give me your foot.Kari blinked.What?A few of your blisters must have already popped, and you dont want them getting infected.Your foot.With a Herculean effort, she lifted one leg and held out her foot.He took it in those big hands and rested it on his thigh.He opened a Band Aid, squirted antibiotic ointment onto it, and stuck it over one of her blisters, working slowly and diligently.And Kari just sat there, staring at him with disbelief.She remembered how shed once asked Greg to rub her sore neck, and he gave it a halfhearted effort with one hand while he checked stock prices on his iPhone with the other.This was different.So incredibly different.Just the feel of her foot resting on Marcs rock hard thigh was sigh worthy, not to mention the care he took over every one of her blisters.Theyd hurt like hell before, but now she didnt even feel the pain.Youve done this before, she said.What?he said, never looking up from his task.Fixed boo boos.Yeah.Once or twice.Big understatement there.Parenthood meant dealing with scraped knees and elbows all over the place.And as Kari thought about this big, tough man with his young daughter in his lap, drying her tears and putting on Band Aids  It seemed so out of character.Maybe that was why it gave Kari such a warm, squishy feeling inside.With Marc so tuned in to his task, she could stare at him all she wanted to.And she really wanted to.She let her gaze wander from the short, dark brush of beard along his jaw, to the smooth bronze skin of his cheeks, to the tiny lines radiating out from the corners of his eyes, saying that he actually did smile once in a while.As she took another sip of wine, she started to think about other things, mostly those hands of his somewhere on her body besides her feet.What was so bad about the job?he asked her.Aside from the obvious.Well, there wasnt much I didnt screw up.I messed up orders.I brought the wrong stuff to people.And the menu.There must be a thousand things on it.Memorize it.Theres no time for that.Bring a menu home tomorrow night and study it.Being a waitress is no different from any other job.You just have to learn the basics.How are you getting along with Bobbie?Kari froze.You know about her?Everybody who eats at Rosies regularly knows about her.Tourists not so much, which is why shes still there.You might have warned me.Just dont take any crap from her, and youll be fine.He stuck on another Band Aid.Speaking of burning those boats, have you had your mail forwarded here?That hadnt even crossed her mind.Uhno.If youre living here now, you need to do that.USPS.gov.There should be a form out there to fill out.I will.So how are you feeling now?The ibuprofen, the wine, the heating pad, a sexy man putting Band Aids on her blisterswhat didnt make her feel good?Much better, she said.Marc applied the last Band Aid and removed her foot from his thigh, and she settled back with a sigh of pure contentment.Nobody in her adult life had ever done anything like this for her.On the surface, Marc was big and gruff and demanding, but beneath it all was a kindness and compassion she never would have imagined, and it drew her to him like nothing else.Now she hoped he would pour himself a glass of wine and stay for a while.After that, who knew what might happen?Okay, he said.Its time for me to go.Karis eyes flew open.Go?Why?Im finished here.Ill leave everything.Youll probably need all of it again tomorrow.No!She didnt want him to go.She wanted him to stay there forever so this feeling would never go away.You dont have to go, she said.I have work to do.After dark?Accounting stuff.Why dont you forget that for tonight?Stick around?Have a glass of wine?Cant, he said.Things pile up.Dont you ever relax?Not when there are things to do.As he rose to leave, Kari felt a rush of disappointment.But what was she supposed to do?Grab him by the arm and forbid him to leave?Wait, she said.Ill lock the door behind you.Assuming you lock things all the way out here.Always lock doors, Marc said.You never know.Of course he would say that.Mr.Practicality.And of course Mr.Practicality couldnt stick around and have a glass of wine if there was an iota of work to be done.To say she was attracted to him was an understatement.To say he was frustrating the hell out of her was a bigger one.Suppressing a groan of pain, she rose from the sofa and followed him.When he reached the door, she called out to him.Marc?He stepped back into the room.What?She stopped in front of him.Thank you for all this.It was no big deal.
