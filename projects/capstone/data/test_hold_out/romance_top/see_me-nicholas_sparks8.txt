Well stand, she said.If Ken didnt understand what that meant, there was no question in Marias mind that Barney did.She saw an ever so slight lifting of his eyebrows and assumed he was doing some rapid mental calculations.Most people would likely have taken their seat again, but Barney understood the value of maintaining eye level, even if Ken did not.He stood straighter.You said this matter concerns the firm?Actually, I said that it concerns the both of you.But yes, in the end, it concerns the firm as well.Im glad you came by, then, he said, the drawl and syrupy cadence returning.We just had a discussion with Maria about the false allegations, as Im sure youre aware, and Im confident that Maria will do whats right for all involved.You shouldnt be quite so confident, Jill countered.I wanted you two to be the first to know that Maria just informed me that Ken Martenson has been engaging in conduct that any jury would construe as sexual harassment and that she is strongly considering filing a report with the EEOC as a preliminary to filing her own lawsuit.Thats not true!Ken erupted, the first words Maria had heard him speak all day.Jill turned toward him, her tone as even as before.You told her she should try harder to be a team player.That having you in her corner could help her when she came up for partner.And then you groped her.I did no such thing!You touched her inappropriately, on her neck and chest.I I only touched her shoulder.So you admit to touching her?And keeping your hands on her even though she clearly found it offensive?With her words, Ken realized it was probably better to shut his mouth, and he turned toward Barney.If Barney was angered by what Jill had said, he didnt show it.Maria made no claim of sexual harassment in our meeting today, nor in fact has she ever said anything to me in all the months shes been working here.Why would she?She knew youd cover for him.Just like before, when the other sexual harassment cases were settled.Barney drew a long breath.Im sure theres been some sort of misunderstanding and well be able to work this out amicably.There is no reason to resort to threats.I havent resorted to threats.In fact, if anything, you should be thankful that were here so you arent surprised.I am, he agreed.I do think we could discuss the matter more civilly if we take our seats.I would like to hear what Maria has to say.Im sure you would.Well let you read her statement in detail as soon as its filed.For now, Ill speak for her.Kens eyes went wide, but Barney simply looked at Jill.You do understand that you cant represent Maria for obvious conflict of interest reasons?Im here as her friend.Im not sure that makes a difference.Then lets start with this: Both Maria and I will be leaving the firm.We had no intention of informing you of that today, but considering that Maria can additionally make a case for retaliation, I thought it best to get it over with now.For the first time, even Barney wasnt sure what to say.He looked from Jill to Maria and back to Jill.Did you say youre both leaving the firm?Yes.Where will you be working?Thats not the issue were discussing.Right now, were talking about the lawsuit Maria intends to file.We all know that the allegations being made by Lynn and the others are serious, and can you imagine how much more heft their cases will have when Maria comes forward as well?But I didnt do anything, Ken mumbled.Barney merely glared at him.Do you think anyone will believe that?After everything the others say in court?But of course, it wont get that far.Everyone in this room knows that youre going to settle.These cases are almost always settled.Im not sure I can say the same for Maria.She was pretty upset when she spoke with me.Though I wont be her counsel on this case, my suspicion is that she may elect to take this as far as it can go.Barney straightened his jacket.Im assuming that youre here not simply to inform us in advance that youre going to file or that youre leaving.I assume youre here because you would like to resolve this matter.Why would you think that?There is nothing to be gained by telling us in advance that you intend to make a report with the EEOC.Maybe I just felt a remaining bit of loyalty to the firm.Perhaps.Or maybe I just wanted Ken to know that in addition to ruining the firm and having his savings wiped out, hes probably going to have to sell that ridiculous car of his by the time Maria is through with him.Ken moaned ever so slightly.Barney ignored it.How can we resolve this?For starters, Maria wants six weeks of vacation this year.Why would she want six weeks vacation when shes planning on leaving?Because its on her bucket list.Because Ken is an ass.Because yesterday, she saw a rainbow when she was walking by a yard with the sprinklers on.Because Maria had to work evenings and weekends because of you and so she hasnt had a day off since shes been here.My point is, it doesnt matter why she wants it.She does, and thats that.First year employees are only entitled to a week.Then make an exception.Paid vacation, mind you, which will be added to her final check.Ken was about to say something, but Barney held up his hand to stop him.Anything else?Yes.As far as a two week notice goes?Thats out.Today is Marias last day and she wont be coming back.She gets paid for these two weeks as well.Barney looked like he had eaten something unpleasant.Is that all?Two months salary?Not quite.For her mental suffering, she needs a bonus.Lets make it three additional months salary on top of those two months.Barney was quiet.And in exchange for that?Ill have to talk it over with her, but Im fairly certain youll never hear anything from her about any of Kens deviant behavior.No reports, no lawsuits.Just over and done and well go our own separate ways.Barney was quiet, probably debating how serious Maria might be about all of this.Jill, however, knew exactly what he was thinking.Shes not bluffing, Barney.You know how Ken is.You know what hes done to others and you also know that he sexually harassed Maria.More than that, you know were not talking about a lot of money here.Essentially, shes offering you a gift because as much as she despises Ken, she has great respect for you.And the affidavit?Dont even go there, Jill warned.Maria is not going to lie.However, she wont sign an affidavit as to what actually happened.Itll just be forgotten.And if shes deposed by the other litigants?Shell be on the planet Jupiter by then, so theres no reason to worry.Excuse me?Oh.She smiled.Sorry.I thought wed detoured into fantasy land.Fantasy?You and I both know she wont get deposed because youre not going to let it get that far.Youll end up settling.You have to, or its going to cost you a fortune, even if you win.Barney glanced at Ken, then back to Jill.May I ask what your demands are?Since youll be leaving the firm as well?Only one, and its not about money, Jill answered.In exchange, Ill finish out the next couple of weeks here just as I planned to do, work with the partners to make sure any of my clients barely notice the transition, and after that, Ill move on.Whats the one demand?Id like you to throw me a small going away party here at the office.Nothing fancy  just a cake at lunch or whatever  but Id like the chance to say good bye to everyone in one fell swoop.Obviously, until then, I think we all know it would be best to keep our departure as quiet as possible.The other partners have to know, but I dont want to start a stampede of employees racing for the exits.Believe it or not, I hope you get this settled and are able to put it behind you as quickly and quietly as possible.There are a lot of good people here.While Barney may have appreciated Jills sentiment, Maria saw him twitch as he brought a hand to his chin.Five months paid for Maria is a bit high.Im sure the partners will balk at that.Now, three months I could probably swing  Dont misinterpret my high hopes for others here as a chance to negotiate, because we arent negotiating.This is a one time, take it or leave it offer.Which ends the moment that Maria and I walk out the door and she starts on the EEOC paperwork.Frankly, shes asking for far less than what youre going to have to shell out to the others.So right now, you should be thanking her, not trying to lowball.Barney took his time before answering.Id still have to talk to the other partners, he finally said.I cant make this kind of decision on my own.Sure you can.We both know the partners will follow your lead, so lets stop playing games, all right?Are you in or out?Five months salary?Maria exclaimed.They were standing in the parking lot near Marias car.A few minutes earlier, Maria had stashed the few personal items shed had in the office  primarily photographs of her family and a few shed taken while paddleboarding  into a small box and had carried it outside, placing it in the trunk.At Barneys request, she hadnt said good bye to anyone, nor had anyone seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary regarding her departure.Jill had been waiting for her.Jill smiled.Pretty good, huh?Truthfully, she was reeling.No more Ken; no more weekends trying to keep up with Barneys demands, and five months salary, straight into her savings account.Shed never, ever had anything close to that; what had just happened was akin to buying a winning scratch off lottery ticket.Im still in shock.I probably could have gotten you more.Thats more than enough.I feel guilty for getting that much.Dont feel bad.Because, believe it or not, you were sexually harassed.It may not have been as obvious to you as it was to others, but you were.You deserve this.And believe me when I say that Barney is breathing a massive sigh of relief right now, or we wouldnt be standing here doing a mini celebration.Thank you so much.You dont have to thank me.If our positions were reversed, you would have done it for me.Im nowhere near as good as you are.You took on Barney.And you won.Jill offered a sheepish grin.And you want to know the crazy thing?Whats that?Leslie is way, way better than me.The thought made Marias head spin.Thank you again for taking a chance on me.Youre welcome.But I know exactly what Im getting.Maria motioned toward the building.Its strange to think that Im not going to work tomorrow.And most likely, I will never walk through those doors again.It happened so fast.Like what they say about bankruptcy?It happened slow at first and then all at once?Maria nodded.I guess.As much as I dislike what Barney was trying to do just now, I still hope hell be okay.Barneys the one attorney you never have to worry about.Hell be fine, no matter what.And between you and me?It wouldnt surprise me if he leaves the firm, too.Why would he leave?Because he can.And would you want to keep working with Ken?Maria didnt answer, but then again she didnt have to.Jill was right, and while Maria was still trying to process her day, she suddenly found herself thinking about Lester Manning and the things Margolis had told her.She crossed her arms.What would you do if you were me?About Lester, I mean?Maria asked.I dont think you know enough yet to reach any conclusions.I know that probably doesnt help you, but  She trailed off, and Maria couldnt blame her, since even to her, the pieces simply didnt fit.Maria drove through heavy traffic to Mayfaire, an upscale shopping complex.As she drove, she tried to process the fact that she wouldnt be heading in to work tomorrow, or even on Monday.The last time that had happened had been after shed quit her job in Charlotte  She shook her head, forcing the thought away.She knew exactly where it would lead, and the last thing she wanted was to think about Lester or the boyfriend or anything Margolis had told her, since it would lead exactly nowhere.Unless confusion was a place.No more Ken, she marveled.No more weekends that Barney could ruin.In two weeks, shed be working with Jill.And five months salary.On the career front, she doubted it was possible for things to get any better, and that called for a celebration of sorts, maybe even a splurge.She could trade in her car and get something sportier  as long as it wasnt a red Corvette  but as quickly as the thought entered her mind, she knew it was just a fantasy.She was too frugal and she had no intention of trying to explain to her dad why shed bought a car instead of paying down some of the student debt she owed from law school or opening an investment account.Or simply saving the money, since shed probably need to buy into the partnership in a few years.Lost in the events of today was the idea that she could actually be a partner at a law firm someday  in her early thirties, even.Whoever could have predicted that?By the time she reached Mayfaire, dusk had settled in.She texted Serena that shed get to the house a few minutes before seven, but not to hold up dinner on her account.Seconds later, her phone dinged with Serenas response.Ill just get there late, too.Id hate for you to miss any of the scintillating conversation!Maria smiled.She texted her parents and let them know when shed arrive, then headed toward Williams Sonoma.It was always a bit challenging to get her mom something special  Carmen always fretted about money spent on her, especially by her children  but since a new car was out of the question, Maria figured she could splurge a bit on some new pots and pans.Despite the restaurant and her own love of cooking, her mom had never considered buying new cookware.What she did have had been around since Maria was in elementary school.Or maybe even longer than that.The shopping expedition ended up being more of a splurge than shed planned.High quality cookware was expensive, but Maria felt good about it.Her parents had paid for private schooling, a used car at sixteen that lasted until she got the one she owned now, four years of college, and half of law school, and never once had she done something like this.She knew her mom might fret  her dad would say nothing  but she deserved it.She loaded the gifts in the trunk, next to the box of personal effects.Thankfully, the traffic had mostly cleared out.Before starting the car, she texted Serena that she was fifteen minutes away, and then realized she hadnt yet told Colin what had happened at the office.She still felt the need to celebrate and with whom better than him?Later, at his place or hers Who knew that money could be an aphrodisiac?Knowing he was probably behind the bar already, she texted him and asked that he call when he had the chance.Hed probably work until around ten or eleven, and that would give her enough time after leaving her parents to head back home, light a couple of candles, maybe even have a glass of wine.She knew it would end up being a late night, but he didnt have class in the morning and she didnt have to go to work, so why did it matter?She set the phone on the passenger seat and headed toward her parents house.After turning into the neighborhood, she found herself wondering how many times in her life shed made that exact turn.Tens of thousands, probably, she thought, which amazed her, as did the neighborhood itself.While people had moved in and moved out, the houses seemed largely unaffected by the passage of time, and every corner brought with it memories: lemonade stands or roller skating, driveway fireworks on the Fourth of July.Trick or treating.Walking home with friends.Her phone began to ring, disrupting the flow of images.Glancing over, she saw Colins name and answered with a smile.Hey, she said.I didnt think you were allowed to make calls while at work.Im not supposed to, but I saw your text.I asked the other bartender to cover for me for a few minutes.Are you okay?Yeah, Im fine, she said.Im almost at Mom and Dads.I thought you were supposed to be there already.I had to buy my mom a gift first and that took forever, she said.But hey  youll never guess what happened today.Did Margolis call again?No.Its about work, she said, and as she approached her parents home, she told Colin what had transpired.Which means Im kinda rich right now.Sounds like it.I bought my mom some fabulous cookware.Ill bet shes going to love it.Once she gets over the guilt, she will.But the real reason Im calling is that Ive decided that Id like you to come over tonight.To my place.Didnt we already agree that Id come over?And that Id call when I got off?Yes, but when we decided that, I wasnt in the mood to celebrate.Now I am, and I wanted to warn you in advance.Warn me about what?Well, now that Im sorta rich, I might make a few demands on you this evening.Physical ones, I mean.He laughed, and she could tell he liked what she was suggesting.Okay.Up ahead, she saw Serenas car parked in front of her parents house; on either side of the street, the sidewalks were deserted.Up and down the block, houses were lit from the inside, lamps on and televisions flickering, families relaxing at the end of a long day.Whatever you do, dont let the anticipation ruin your concentration at work.Id hate for you to get in trouble with your boss.Ill do my best.She pulled in behind Serenas car and shut down the engine.And one more thing.Remember what I told Margolis?When he asked why I was still with you?Yes.She got out and rounded the car to the trunk.I just want you to know that I meant every word, she said.He laughed again.Okay.She opened the trunk.Unfortunately, Im going to have to cut this call a little short.Im going to need both hands to carry everything.I get it.Ive got to get back to work anyway.Oh, before you go   As she eyed the boxes, she registered movement in her peripheral vision and she turned.A man was crossing the street toward her, moving fast.There was a split second when she wasnt sure how to react.This was a safe place; in this neighborhood, shed never so much as heard of a burglary or a domestic dispute that had gotten out of hand, and shed never been afraid.She was only yards from her parents front door, on a street so safe she used to camp out in the backyard on warm summer nights.And yet, the strangers purposeful gait made the hairs on the back of her neck suddenly rise because she knew instinctively that whoever it was didnt belong here.Darkness made clear recognition impossible, but in that instant the mans shadowed face was suddenly illuminated by the lights that spilled from her parents living room.She saw a glint of metal in his hand and with the sight of the gun, fear took hold.She couldnt move and could barely breathe; only vaguely did she hear Colin say her name on the phone.Colin repeated her name a second and third time, his mounting concern enough to finally bring her back.Hes here, she finally whispered.Whos there?Colin demanded.Whats going on?He has a gun, she said.Who has a gun?Lester Manning, she said.Hes here at the house.CHAPTER 23      Colin      T  he shock of hearing Maria say Lesters name gave way to a surge of adrenaline, the fight or flight reflex kicking in.Colin vaguely heard Lester shout something and the call was disconnected.Lester.By then, Colin was already on the move, bursting from the back room and rushing past the bar.He wove around tables and guests even as he hit the redial button.The phone went straight to voice mail.Redial.Voice mail again.Maria is in trouble.Behind him, he heard the bartender call his name; waitresses looked over in confusion, and as Colin exploded out the entrance, the manager demanded to know where he was going.Lester has a gun.Colin raced around the corner of the building, his feet slipping on the lightly sanded sidewalk.Regaining his footing, he sprinted up the street, already calculating the most direct route to Marias parents place.Hoping the roads were clear.Hoping his car would start.Please, let it start.Hed call the police from the car.He swerved around an elderly couple and rocketed into the street, his car in sight.Precious seconds ticking away.Lester could have already shoved her into his car and driven off, just like Gerald Laws did to Cassie  It was twenty minutes to her parents.He would make it in ten.Or fewer.Maria might already be gone  At the car now.Jumping in, jamming his keys in the ignition, careful not to flood the engine even as he turned the key hard, and the old Camaro roared to life.Colin peeled away from the curb, his eyes already on the cars ahead.Closing the gap between his car and those ahead of him, he glanced toward his phone.With one hand he frantically dialed 911 and heard the operator ask the nature of the emergency.A man with a gun, threatening a woman, he said.Maria Sanchez.A guy named Lester Manning had been stalking her, and hed surprised her at her parents  He couldnt remember the address offhand, but told the operator Marias parents names, as well as the street and cross street.Identifying himself, he stated that he was on the way.When the operator urged him to let the police handle the situation without interference, he hung up.By then he was speeding along, the nose of his car practically on the bumper of the car in front of him.With the next lane blocked by a black Range Rover coasting along at the speed limit, Colin cut across the breakdown lane and zoomed past a cluster of cars before veering back onto the road.He hit the accelerator hard and within a few seconds came up on a pickup truck and a white minivan driving side by side.He passed them in the breakdown lane, too, this time barely slowing.Reaching the turnoff to the bridge, he jerked the wheel hard, tires squealing.Racing past more cars in the breakdown lane, he finally made it to a long stretch of road with less traffic and jammed the accelerator to the floor.Adrenaline sharpened his instincts behind the wheel, his body responding in perfect sync with the car.He hit eighty, ninety, and then a hundred miles an hour and saw a red light ahead, brake lights glowing as cars slowed.Unwilling to slow down, he gunned into a bike lane.Bursting through a gap at the intersection, still he pressed on, zigzagging around cars and using the bike lane when necessary.Making a turn, he accelerated toward a long line of cars, and with nowhere to go, he cut through a gas station parking lot at close to thirty miles an hour, making people jump out of the way.The police were on their way but it still might not be soon enough.His mind raced frantically, wondering whether Lester had already forced Maria into a car, where he might have taken her  Or if he had already shot her.Another turn, this time to the left, and for the first time, he was forced to come to a complete stop at a crowded intersection.He pounded the steering wheel, then held his breath as he plunged into multiple lanes of traffic.He watched as another driver slammed on his brakes, missing him by only inches.Speeding through a residential neighborhood at sixty miles per hour, he scanned for children or other pedestrians or pets, houses passing in a blur.Another turn.Tires screeched and the rear of the Camaro fishtailed left and then right, Colin struggling for control.On this block, cars were parked on either side of the street, limiting visibility, and Colin reluctantly slowed the car.Just ahead, he could make out a couple pushing a stroller on the sidewalk; a kid playing catch with his dad on the opposite side of the street; a guy walking his dog with a long retractable leash  Another turn and a clear road with better visibility; Colin sped up again, finally recognizing the Sanchez neighborhood.It had taken him nine minutes.He began to bank into the final turn at top speed and almost hit a blue Camry that was approaching fast in the middle of the road.Colin swerved automatically to the right, as did the other car, the Camaro fishtailing again, tires screeching.Colin felt another sudden adrenaline surge as his heart hammered.He briefly glimpsed two men in the front seat with startled expressions, their eyes wide as the cars slid past within inches of each other, too close.Way too close, and he gripped the wheel hard, regaining control.Barely.He was almost there, the Sanchezes street up ahead.A single turn to go, and he didnt hit the brakes until he was almost there.Fear taking over now.Praying he wasnt too late.Shearing into the turn, he heard a siren behind him.In the rearview mirror, he saw the flashing lights on top of the squad car as it barreled around the same turn hed just made.Colin slowed only slightly, but the squad car was closing fast and Colin heard a squawk from the loudspeaker.Pull over!Not a chance, Colin thought.No matter what happens to me.CHAPTER 24      Maria      M  aria couldnt take her eyes from the gun or the person holding it.Lester Manning.Margolis had been wrong.Lester wasnt in the hospital.He had been waiting for her here.The knowledge paralyzed her, and she watched as he snatched the phone from her hand.His face contorted into something she barely recognized.No calls!he shouted, making her jump.The tone was off key, on edge.No police!As he backed away, her senses heightened and she saw it all: the unkempt hair and ratty canvas jacket, faded red shirt, and torn jeans; the dark holes of his pupils and the rapid rise and fall of his chest.In her head, the words ran together: delusional disorder; acute phase; persecutory delusions.And the gun.He was holding a gun.Her mom and dad were inside, as was Serena.Her family was in danger and it was dark and no one in the neighborhood was out  She should have run as soon as she saw him coming, sprinted for the front door and locked him out, but shed stood there like her legs belonged to another person  I know what YOU DID!he hissed.The words came out fast and almost unintelligible.As he continued to back away, she saw the phone light up and heard it ring.Colin.Lester startled, staring at the phone in his hand.She watched Lester end the call with the press of a button.Saw the phone light up and ring again.Lester frowned as he ended the second call, talking at the phone as though it were alive.I said no calls!he called out.No police!Then mumbling: Think straight.Its not real.His hands were shaking as he muted the phone and shoved it into his jacket pocket.Theyre not coming.Please God, let Colin have already called the police, she thought.The police are coming and will be here soon.Ill just ride it out until they get here.I will not be like Cassie.If he so much as touches me, Im going to scream and fight like crazy.But  Margolis had said that Lester could function normally sometimes; hed been able to work a part time job.And when shed met him, he was odd, but not psychotic, even when clearly struggling.Maybe she could talk to him She just needed to stay calm.Hi, Lester, she began, trying to keep her voice steady and pleasant.His eyes flashed up, his pupils huge.No, not huge.Dilated.On drugs?Hi, Lester?Thats all you can say?I want you to know Im sorry about Cassie   No, no, no!he said, raising his voice.You dont get to say her name.She died because of you!She raised her hands instinctively, expecting him to lunge at her, but Lester instead moved yet another step farther away.As she waited for him to go on, she realized that he sounded less angry than afraid?Or paranoid.And the last thing I want is to set him off.She lowered her eyes, her heart hammering.She could hear Lesters labored breathing as long seconds passed.The silence stretched out until she heard him sniff and then say, No, in a softer voice.She could hear his breathing finally begin to slow, and when he spoke again, his voice was shaky but subdued.Theyre safe, he said, nodding at the house.Your family.I saw them through the windows.I watched your sister go inside.What happens next is up to you.She flinched at his words but held her silence.His breath continued to slow in what seemed like a conscious effort, his gaze never wavering.I came to talk.You need to hear what I have to say.Youll listen to me this time, wont you, Maria?Yes.The doctors tell me it isnt real, he explained.I tell myself its not real.But then I remember the truth.About Cassie and my mom.The police.And what they did.And I know youre the one who started it.The doctors can tell me its not real and that Im making it up, but I know the truth.So tell me: Youve been talking about me, havent you?When she didnt answer, she watched the muscles begin to tighten in his neck.Dont bother lying.Remember that I already know the answer.Yes, she whispered.Youve talked to the police about me again.Yes, she said again.Thats why the detective came this morning.Where is Colin?she wondered.And the police?She wasnt sure how long she could keep Lester calm   Yes.He turned away, wincing.When we first met you, I wanted to believe you when you said you were doing your best, and that Cassie would be safe.I came to understand that to you, Cassie was no one.Just another name, another nobody.But she wasnt a nobody.She was my sister, and it was your job to protect her.But you didnt.And then  He squeezed his eyes closed.Cassie used to take care of me when my mom was too sick to get out of bed She used to make me chicken noodle soup and wed watch television and shed read me books.Did you know that?She wasnt a nobody.He wiped at his nose with the back of his hand, and when he went on, his voice was almost childlike.We tried to warn you what was going to happen, but you didnt listen.When Cassie died, my mom couldnt stand living anymore.Because of you, she killed herself.Did you know that?Tell the truth.Yes, she admitted.You know all about us, dont you, Maria?You know all about me.Yes.And you sent the police after me after Cassie died.Because you sent the notes.Because you were threatening me.Yes.And your boyfriend He is your boyfriend, right?The big guy at the club?I saw how angry he got after I sent over the drink.He wanted to hurt me, didnt he?Yes.And then, this morning, you sent the police again.Because you slashed my tires!Because youre stalking me!Yes.He stood a bit straighter.Thats what I told the doctors.All of this.But they dont believe me, of course.No one ever believes me, but at least youre being honest.I knew, but now I really know and I can feel the difference in my whole body.You understand, dont you, Maria?No.Yes.It takes over  fear, I mean.No matter how hard you try to fight it, it takes over, crushing the life out of you.Like right now.I know youre afraid of me.Maybe like Cassie was afraid after you failed her?He looked at her for confirmation, waiting.Yes.She watched him tap the gun against the side of his leg.Can you imagine how it feels?To lose your sister?And your mom?And watch people like you go after my dad?And then me?I cant imagine how awful that was.No, you CANT!he shouted suddenly, and in that moment, she heard the faint sound of a police siren in the distance.Lester snapped to attention, recognition dawning as the sirens grew louder.He refocused on Maria.I said no police.I said NO POLICE!His voice cracked, whipsawing between anger and disbelief as he took a step toward her.Im NOT going BACK!Do you HEAR me?Im NOT going BACK!Maria retreated, holding up her hands.Okay  They HURT ME!he cried, taking a step in her direction.His cheeks grew mottled as he thrust his face toward her.They SHOT ELECTRICITY INTO ME!And they put me in the cage with ANIMALS who beat me and they didnt DO ANYTHING!They ALL laughed at me and to them it was just a game!AND YOU DONT THINK I KNOW WHO PUT THEM UP TO IT?Oh, God Hes losing it  YOU DID!he screamed, vibrating with rage.Maria retreated, trying to maintain the distance between them.Her gaze kept flicking to the gun, then back to Lester again.He continued to advance as she backed away, her back almost to the garage door now.YOU called the POLICE!You keep coming back, but this time Im NOT going to let you GET AWAY WITH IT!Serena had to have heard him that time, she thought.Or my parents.Theyll open the front door any second now and Lester will turn and fire  Through the static of her racing thoughts, Maria realized that the first siren had now been joined by another, more distant one, both of them drawing closer.Lesters jaw clenched and his eyes burned with the anguish of betrayal.His finger began inching toward the guns trigger and a single impulse flashed through her body.Go, go, GO!She turned and rounded the car, sprinting toward the house, through the yard.She heard Lester shout her name in surprise, heard a grunt as he started after her, clipping the car.GO!Ten yards.Maybe five.The front door began to open and a slash of light fell across the porch.Maria was sure she could hear him behind her now.Run!She strained forward, surging toward the light.She could feel Lester reaching for her.In what seemed to be slow motion, she watched Serena step out onto the porch.Hes going to kill us both  Standing in a pool of light in front of the open door, Serena didnt understand what was happening.She stared at Maria in confusion as Maria hurtled toward the porch.Are those his fingers skimming the back of my shirt?She willed herself to move even faster, sprinting with everything she had.Maria?Serena called out.Only later would Maria realize that Serena had shouted her name.Almost there  And then, she made it.Grabbing Serena, she pushed the two of them through the still open door, slamming it shut behind them.What are you doing?Serena cried, bewildered.Maria locked the door and grabbed Serenas wrist, jerking hard.Get away from the door!Maria screamed.Hes got a gun!Serena stumbled as Maria pulled, almost falling.Who has a gun?Lester!Dragging Serena to the kitchen, she spotted her mom standing near the stove, clearly startled by the commotion.But no Dad Maria turned from side to side  Oh, God.Wheres Dad?Wait  Lester?Lesters here?Serena demanded from behind her.Hes outside!Maria shouted, her gaze suddenly swinging to the sliding glass doors, hoping her dad was on the porch.Lester Manning!The guy who was chasing me!Hell burst through the door any second  Hell kill me and them, and then kill himself  Just like Gerald Laws and Cassie  With a surge of relief, she spotted her dad at the porch table, Smokey in his lap.Serena was babbling; her mom had started asking questions as well, but Maria registered none of it.Just be quiet!she shouted.Both of you!She slid open the back door.Get in here!she hissed at her father, motioning him inside.He responded instantly, leaping to his feet with the dog tucked under his arm.Both Serena and her mom went quiet.Maria listened intently  for the door, for the sound of a window smashing.Silence.Serena stared at her, fear written on her face.Both of her parents watched her openmouthed.Still nothing.What if Lester was coming around from the back?In the silence, Maria registered the sounds of the sirens again.Loud enough now to be heard from inside the house.I dont understand, Serena finally said, her voice trembling with tears.Where was Lester chasing you?In the yard, Maria said.You saw him.He almost grabbed me.But Serena only shook her head in confusion.I saw you running but no one was behind you, she said.I saw someone else running down the street  He had a gun and he was chasing me!No, Serena insisted.He wasnt.Before Maria could process her words, the sound of the sirens filled the house and the walls were flashing red and blue in steady rhythm.The police, she thought.Thank God.At that moment, the front door crashed open.Maria screamed.CHAPTER 25      Colin      A  ll things considered, Colin decided he was okay with what hed done.Though as the adrenaline drained from his system, leaving him feeling both exhausted and shaky, it was hard to ignore the fact that he was on his stomach with his hands cuffed behind his back, guarded by two glowering officers and most likely staring at a long prison term.Maybe he should have pulled over for the officers whod been following him.And maybe he shouldnt have come to a screeching halt behind the squad car that was already at the Sanchez place while those officers had been approaching the door.And maybe he shouldnt have ignored them when theyd demanded that he stop his charge to the front door and simply let them handle it.If hed made different decisions, the officers probably wouldnt have drawn their weapons, nor would he have faced a situation in which hed wondered whether they might actually fire them.On the plus side, he hadnt actually touched any of the officers after hed kicked the door in, but none of them were in any mood to listen when hed tried to tell them about the vacant house or the park, places that Lester may have run off to.All four were too pissed for that.They had him on speeding, reckless driving, and ignoring lawful directions, and they werent going to settle for writing a couple of tickets and be done with it.Theyd placed him under arrest, which meant his deal was going to be revoked.His lawyers would fight it; no question about that, but more than likely, the original judge would be informed.That judge  as evidenced by his decision in the first place  was fair and reasonable, but hed also been crystal clear in his expectations, and the court would know about it.Add in the fact that Margolis would be arguing on the other side for permanent placement among the dangerous and violent, and the writing was on the wall.Prison.He wasnt afraid of being locked up.As a general rule, he did well in places with rules and structure, even without freedom.He knew how to keep to himself and mind his own business and look the other way when necessary and keep his mouth shut, and after a while, the whole thing would likely become routine.Hed survive and eventually get released and hed start over again.But  Maria wouldnt wait for him, and he wouldnt be able to become a teacher.He didnt want to think about those things.Given the same situation, hed do it all again.Marias stalker shows up with a gun?Had to try to save her.Simple as that.How could he have known that Lester would have been gone by the time he arrived?Had they listened to him, Colin figured that the police could have found Lester already.But precious minutes had ticked by while they put on the handcuffs and read Colin his rights, and it wasnt until the officers had calmed their nerves that they were finally able to listen first to Marias story, which came out in fits and starts, and then to Felix, whod said that he didnt intend to press charges for the broken door and splintered frame.Both Serena and Carmen were crying throughout.Way too late, hed finally watched two of the four officers leave in one of the squad cars in search of Lester.After that, surprising him, Maria asked the remaining officers to call Detective Margolis when her pleas to have Colin released were met with indifference.Colin closed his eyes, hoping that the detective would be otherwise occupied.A moment later, one of the officers announced that Margolis was on his way.Margolis was going to love this.No doubt hed put on one of his self satisfied smirks while he gave Colin the whole I warned you all along that this would be coming speech that he was surely already rehearsing as he made his way here.But again, no regrets.Maria and her family were safe, and that was all that mattered.That, and stopping Lester from showing up again Maria had told the officers that Lester had become enraged as soon as hed heard the sirens.Until that point, however, Maria had been able to keep him calm by talking to him.Or, rather, by letting Lester voice whatever was going through his deranged brain and simply agreeing with him.But what about the next time?Would Lester be so easily placated?Or would he just grab her and take her someplace where the police wouldnt find them?The thought made him sick, and he wanted to kick himself for failing to check out the hospital himself.How had Lester gotten out?If hed become delusional when the detective arrived this morning, why hadnt he been restrained?Or did they even do that anymore?And there was another thing that was bothering him: How had Lester known Maria would be here?Maybe he went by the office and then her condo and saw that she wasnt around, but  His thoughts were interrupted first by headlights, then by the sound of a slowing car.He heard it pull over and come to a stop, listening as a car door opened and closed with a thud a few seconds later.Margolis.Do you ever get that feeling like Christmas has come early?Margolis said, squatting down next to him.Approaching Maria, hed done a double take at the sight of Colin on the ground in cuffs and practically skipped over to him instead.Because I think it just came early for me.Colin said nothing.Anything he said would just get thrown back in his face.I mean, here I am, just heading out to get a quick bite not more than ten minutes away, and I get a call urgently requesting my presence over here.And who do I find but my old pal Colin?I must say that I havent seen you looking this good in a long time.Colin noted the reflection of Margoliss grin in his highly polished shoes.What did you do?Get in an argument with your girlfriend here?Maybe pushed Mom or Dad when they tried to intervene?Or did you go after one of the officers after they showed up and tried to calm you down?He spat out his toothpick, letting it fall dangerously close to Colins face in the grass.You might as well drop the silent act and tell me.Im going to find out in a minute anyway.Colin let out a breath.Traffic violations, he said.Margolis cocked his head in surprise.No kidding?When Colin didnt respond, the detective shook his head, smirking.I gotta admit that I never saw that one coming.But hey  Ill take it any way I can get it.So let me talk to your girlfriend over there  if you still call her your girlfriend, I mean.Even if you didnt so much as lay a finger on her, she doesnt strike me as the visit prison every weekend to support her man type, and Ive always been a pretty good judge of character.Colin watched him stand.When Margolis turned and started toward Maria, Colin cleared his throat.Can I get up now?Margolis looked over his shoulder for a couple of seconds, then shrugged.I dont know.Can you?Using his head to brace himself, Colin lifted his hips and shot his knees forward in a single flowing motion, landing on his feet.Margolis waved off one of the officers, who had taken a step toward Colin.He smirked again.With moves like that, Im sure all the guys in prison will want to dance with you.But tell you what  why dont you wait right there while I figure out whats going on here.Margolis signaled to the two officers to approach and Colin watched as they conferred in low tones.One of them thumbed toward Maria a couple of times; the other nodded in Colins direction.By then, a number of the neighbors had come outside and were standing on their lawns or in the street, craning their necks for a better view.He wasnt the only one whod noticed: Margolis did as well, and after a brief discussion with the family, everyone except Colin began to head inside.Surprising Colin, Margolis motioned for him to join them.In the living room, Maria again went through the story from the top, including a description of what Lester had been wearing, only this time in a more linear fashion.Her family stood behind her, looking more upset than she did, while the two officers whod arrested Colin flanked the front door.Colin watched as Margolis took notes, Serena occasionally interjecting.It wasnt until Maria was finished that Margolis asked his first question.Did he ever directly threaten you with the gun?Margolis asked.He was holding it in his hand.But he didnt raise it?Or point it at you?Why does that make a difference?Maria demanded.He showed up at the house with a gun.You need to arrest him.Margolis held up his hands.Dont get me wrong.Im on your side.With his admission that he sent the roses to the office and had the drink delivered and now this, theres not a doubt that youd be able to get the Fifty C.  I cant imagine that any judge would turn down the request, and Ill put a call in to find out if I can get it expedited.I was asking because I was trying to determine whether he additionally violated any gun laws.Hes mentally ill.That makes it illegal for him to own a firearm in this state.Maybe.Marias eyes flashed.He was in a psychiatric hospital this morning.Or so you told me.I have no reason to believe that he wasnt there, and trust me  Ill make absolutely sure the detective was correct about that.But when I was talking about mental illness, I meant legally.To this point, I havent had access to his medical records, and in those instances when he was arrested, the cases were dismissed.Im not sure his mental status has actually been adjudicated.Theres also a difference between entering a hospital voluntarily and being committed involuntarily.Youre splitting hairs, Maria said, her frustration becoming evident.I told you how he was acting.He was talking to the phone, for Gods sake.Hes delusional and he threatened me with a gun!Are you sure?Did you listen to a single thing I said?Margolis stood straighter, defensiveness on display.To be clear, nothing you said indicated that he raised the gun or compelled you to do anything.And when you retreated to your house, he ran in the opposite direction.For a second, Maria said nothing, but Colin noted a flash of uncertainty in her eyes.What about the fact that he slashed my tires and stole my phone?He told you he slashed your tires?No, but Maria looked up at him.Why are you doing this?Making excuses for him.Its like youre looking for any reason not to arrest him.On the contrary.Im trying to find something that will stick.Theres no reason to arrest him if I cant hold him.He had a gun!Doesnt that mean anything?It would if he tried to conceal it.Or threatened you.But according to you, he didnt do either.Thats insane.Thats the law.Of course, if he doesnt have a permit for the weapon, thats something I can use.But that wont be enough to hold him for long.Nor will the fact that he took your phone.What about slashing my tires?Did he admit to that?Margolis asked again.No, but  Margolis sighed.I know this is frustrating for you, but I really am trying to help you here.Im looking for something that might give rise to an actual arrest, on charges serious enough to keep him locked away.Okay, then.I was mistaken earlier.I remember now that he did aim the gun at me.Pointed it at me the whole time.Margolis lifted an eyebrow.Youre changing your story?Im correcting it, she said.All right.He nodded.But before we go that route, you should also realize that this entire situation may be more complex than you think.What does that mean?Im not at liberty to say.Its still early in the investigation.For now, all you really need to know is that Im exploring a lot of different angles.Different angles?Colin thought.Maria shot him a questioning look, then turned back to Margolis just as a knock sounded at the door.One of the officers whod been searching for Lester poked his head in.Margolis excused himself and stepped outside for a minute, then returned to Maria and the family.The other two officers joined him inside, remaining near the door.The officers said they couldnt find him.They went through the neighborhood a couple of times, talked with a few people who were out, and no one had seen him.Colin opened his mouth, then closed it again.Margolis noticed.Something to say?I was wondering if they checked the park, he said.And the house on the next block that backs up to this one.Margolis stared at him.Why?Colin told them what hed learned, as well as his suspicions about the vacant house and Lesters spying activities.He also mentioned where he suspected Lester had been parking his car.At Margoliss prodding, Colin admitted hed been visiting the neighborhood late at night and early in the morning, and had spent time researching license plates.Marias parents looked sick at the revelations; meanwhile, Margoliss stony gaze never swerved from him.Youre just telling me this now?That youve been playing private investigator all this time?Colin nodded toward the officers.I told the cops when they were arresting me where Lester might have gone.They didnt want to listen.It was quiet for a moment.One of the officers shifted his weight from one foot to the other.But he wasnt running toward the park, Serena ventured softly.Or for the house.Excuse me?Margolis said.The park is a few streets over that way, Serena said, pointing in the direction of the kitchen.And unless he wanted to take the long way around the block, he wasnt running toward the vacant house, either.He ran the other way, in the opposite direction.Margolis absorbed this before excusing himself to huddle with the officers, two of whom subsequently departed.About half an hour too late, Colin thought.Margolis returned to Maria.Assuming Lester drove here, and since there are no cars registered in his name, theyll find out if any of the cars have been stolen or if we can link them to Lester in another way.Of course, Lester may have doubled back and taken the car or he may have simply run off, but the important thing for now is that Im confident that youre safe.Are you planning to return to your place?Shell be staying with us, Felix announced.Serena too.Margolis thumbed over his shoulder.Your front door is broken.I have some two by fours in the garage.Ill brace it, and then tomorrow, Ill have it repaired.Do you have an alarm?Yes, he said.But we dont use it much.Use it tonight, even though youll have to bypass the front door.And brace the door and keep the shades drawn as a precaution.What about police protection?Serena asked.Having someone at the house?I wont be able to swing that, Margolis answered.Pick your reason: budget cuts, not enough manpower, limits on overtime, or even that the Fifty C hasnt been filed.But Ill call the commander, and Im pretty sure I can arrange for a patrol car to swing by every few hours.What if Lester comes back?I dont think thats likely.Why would you say that?Because hes afraid of the police, and for all he knows, there will be an officer here.Unless hes crazy and doesnt care.He ran off earlier, Margolis said, but realizing how cavalier it probably sounded, he went on.I know youre frightened and upset, Ms.Sanchez.I get it.Ill make sure a couple of the officers cruise the neighborhood for an hour or so.And who knows, maybe theyll get lucky and pick him up.If they do, theyll bring him in and Ill stick him in the interrogation room and see what I can do.And tomorrow, either way, you file for the Fifty C, and the next time he comes anywhere near you, hell be arrested.And that arrest will stick.Colin noted the conflicting emotions playing out across Marias features.She glanced at the officers near the door before drawing a long breath.May I talk to you alone?Margolis debated before finally nodding.He motioned for the other officers to leave and they quietly exited through the front door.At the same time, Serena and her parents wandered toward the kitchen, and once they were gone, Maria sighed.What about Colin?Margolis looked over at him.What about him?I was hoping youd talk to the officer who arrested him.Maybe convince him to let Colin off with some speeding tickets or whatever.Instead of arresting him.Margoliss expression verged on disbelief.Why would I do that?From what they told me, he was doing sixty in a residential neighborhood.He nearly crashed head on with someone a couple of blocks from here, and he refused to pull over.He shook his head.Then once he got here, he defied the officers instructions to stand down and instead made a volatile situation that much worse.I was in danger.You would have done the same thing if you thought someone you loved might be harmed.He should have just let the police handle it.Meanwhile, with the way he was driving, he was endangering other peoples lives.Lester had a gun, for Gods sake!Yet another reason to let the police handle it.Its not fair and you know it!Maria cried, her composure cracking.I mean, sending him to prison?For speeding?I did a lot more than that, Colin thought.The officers only saw me during the last two minutes of the drive.He made his choices, Margolis said.Dont forget that the officers had to draw their weapons.You could have been hurt.Your family could have been hurt.And once he knew I was safe, he deferred to them and submitted willingly.He didnt raise his voice, didnt resist at all.You really want to ruin the rest of his life?Because he was racing to my rescue?Its not my call.Margolis shrugged.No.But I have the sense theyll listen to you.She put her hands on her hips, willing Margolis to meet her gaze.I know that you dont trust Colin, and that you believe he belongs in prison.And if hed struggled with the officers or resisted arrest or done anything else stupid, I wouldnt be asking you to intervene.But those things didnt happen, and you dont strike me as being unreasonable or needlessly vindictive.She hesitated.Id like to think that my impressions of you are correct.Please  For an impossibly long moment, Margolis stared back at her, unmoving.Then, without a word, he started for the door.Five minutes later, Colin was standing near the couch, absently rubbing his wrists where the cuffs had cut into them.Thanks for coming to my aid, he said.Youre welcome.I still cant believe he listened to you.I can.He knew it was the right thing to do.And the arresting officer wasnt upset.After he heard the whole story, I dont think his heart was in it, either.Colin gestured at the door.Im sorry about that.Ill be glad to pay for it.My dad doesnt care.Honestly, hes too angry at the thought that Lester has been spying on the family to worry about a door.How about I help close it up for the night?When she nodded, he followed her to the garage, returning with the two by fours and a hammer and nails.Maria helped hold the boards in place, and when they were finally secure, she stepped toward Colin.Wrapping her arms around him, she held him for a long time before finally pulling back.What are you going to do now?Im going to call my boss, he said.Let her know where I am and find out whether Ive been fired.And then, I figure Ill keep watch outside for the rest of the night.I want to be here if Lester shows up.She nodded.What do you think Margolis meant when he said he was exploring different angles?Lester admitted to almost everything  Colin shrugged.I have no idea.Something about Cassies boyfriend Mark, maybe?Since hes gone off the grid?Colin filled Maria in on the little that hed learned earlier.Behind them, Felix walked into the living room, accompanied by Carmen.Carmen handed a glass of ice water to Colin while Felix inspected the work Colin had done to brace the door.Im sorry about that, Colin said, slightly abashed.I told Maria Id pay for it.Felix nodded.This is good work.Sturdy.He took a step toward Colin, meeting his gaze, his expression softening.I wanted to thank you for rushing here when you thought Maria was in trouble.And for calling the police.Youre welcome.Carmen slipped back to his side as Felix went on.Behind them, Colin could just make out Serena in the kitchen, clearly listening in.When we first met, I believe I may have misjudged you, he said.Maria told me she felt safe with you.Now, I can understand why.At his words, Maria slipped her hand into Colins.I heard you tell Maria that youll want to keep watch tonight.Outside.In case Lester comes back.Yes.I have a problem with that.Colin looked at him, saying nothing.You should be inside the house, not outside.As our guest.He felt Maria squeeze his hand, and despite everything, he couldnt help smiling.Okay.Colin paced the living room, alternately peeking through the curtains on the front window and then doing the same through the kitchen windows.No sign of Lester.Margolis had been good to his word; a patrol car passed by the house four times, twice while the rest of the family was still awake and twice after everyone else had gone to bed.Maria had stayed awake the longest, sitting with Colin until a little after one.Before turning in, Felix had told Colin that hed be up at four to take over the watch and allow Colin to get some sleep.The time to himself felt like a blessing to Colin, allowing him to process everything that had happened that evening.He still had more questions than answers, since nothing made sense.If, for instance, Lester was delusional to the point that he believed that Maria was out to get him, then his fear should have kept him away from Maria, instead of drawing him to her repeatedly.But hadnt Lester essentially admitted hed been stalking Maria all along?And why had Margolis told Maria that he was exploring different angles?Other questions plagued him, too  why had Lester admitted to sending the flowers and the drink, but not to slashing the tires?Had Lester actually driven, and if so, where did he get the car?If hed left his car at the park but ran in the opposite direction, where was he going and why couldnt the police find him?And, again, how had Lester known that Maria would be at the house when Maria herself had forgotten about her moms birthday?The more he learned, the more confused he felt.Youre making me nervous, Maria said.And Im sure youve worn a groove into the floor.Colin looked over and saw her in the hallway, dressed in her pajamas.Did I wake you?No.I slept for a little while.What time is it?A little after three, Maria said.She walked to the couch and patted the cushion beside her.When Colin sat, she leaned her head on his shoulder while he slipped his arm around her.You should probably try to get some sleep.I only have another hour until your dad is up.I dont think hes sleeping.Hes probably tossing and turning like I did.She kissed him on the cheek.Im glad youre here, but my parents are, too.Right before they went to bed, they apologized to me for the way they treated you earlier.There was no reason to apologize.Theyve been very gracious.Especially about me kicking in their door.She shrugged.To be honest, it was pretty impressive.Doors generally keep people out, but this one didnt even slow you down.They feel better knowing that youre here.He nodded.Moonlight spilled in through a crack in the drapes, washing the living room with a silvery glow.I wanted to tell you that the way you dealt with Lester was amazing.Not everyone would have been able to stay calm in that situation.I wasnt calm.I was terrified.Every time I closed my eyes tonight, I kept seeing his face.And it was just so weird.I kept getting the feeling that he was more afraid of me than I was of him, even though he was the one with the gun.I dont understand it, either.I wish the police had found him.I hate knowing that hes still out there following and watching and planning and hiding.What good will a restraining order do if they cant serve him?And what if he shows up again before they do?I thought about leaving town, but what if he follows me?Or tracks me somehow.I mean, even I didnt know I was going to be here tonight, so how did he know?And how did he know Id be at the bar?Ive been wondering about those things, too.And?What am I supposed to do?I just want to feel safe.I have an idea.It might be a bit over the top, but  What is it?He told her.CHAPTER 26      Maria      M  aria was sleeping on the couch when she felt Colin kiss her good bye and whisper that hed be back by eight oclock.She was dimly aware of him slipping out the garage door.Surprising herself, she was able to get a few more hours of sleep before the sounds of the household roused her.Over coffee, she shared Colins plans with her family.They listened with surprise.Her parents would have preferred that she stay where they could keep an eye on her, but they understood Colins reasoning and accepted her decision, asking only that she stay in touch.Colin showed up at her parents house around eight with a disposable cell phone and followed Maria back to her condo.There, she showered, changed into jeans and a white T shirt and black pumps, and packed an overnight bag.By nine, they were at the courthouse, where Maria completed and filed the necessary paperwork for the 50C.Margolis had been good to his word again; the clerk said that theyd get it before the judge to sign before the court convened for the day.Using the disposable phone, Maria texted Margolis her number and asked that he keep her informed as to any progress regarding Lester Manning.To her surprise, Margolis called less than half an hour later and asked to meet with her at a coffee shop.Its a couple of blocks from the courthouse, and well be able to talk in private, he said cryptically.She felt good about the fact that shed filed the paperwork and decided to go with Colins idea.For the first time since all this had started, shed acted instead of reacted.While there was no guarantee that theyd be able to serve Lester with the court order, taking the initiative made her feel as though she had some semblance of control.At the coffee shop, she and Colin sat in a corner booth where they could watch for Margoliss arrival.When he finally walked through the door half an hour late, it took only a second for him to spot them.As he wove his way between tables, Maria noticed the way the fabric of his ill fitting blazer tightened around his biceps.Like Colin, Margolis seemed to spend a lot of time in the gym.He paused near the register to order a cup of coffee and then slid into the booth across from Maria and Colin.When he glanced at Colin, she thought she detected a trace less of his usual animosity.Or then again, maybe she was just imagining it.Any problems with the Fifty C this morning?No, Maria said.And thank you for your help.Its clear they were expecting me.He nodded.Judge Carson will be in court today.I left word with his clerk, so there shouldnt be any holdup.If you dont hear from them, let me know.Sure, she said.The waiter came by, dropping off the cup of coffee.Margolis waited until he left before speaking again.How did you hold up last night?he asked Maria.I didnt sleep well, if thats what youre asking.But at least Lester didnt come back.He nodded.I checked this morning and he wasnt spotted on any of the patrols, either.But hell turn up.A guy like that tends to stand out and make people nervous, which means that calls come in.Im confident someone will let us know when he shows up.If hes still in town, she said.For all we know, he could be back in Charlotte by now.Or God knows where else.If he is, hes not in the hospital.I checked this morning.No sign of him.You should also know that I had my friend drive past the Manning place this morning.No sign of him there, either in the garage apartment or the house.She nodded.On another note, he went on, I spoke with the sheriffs department, and theyre okay with me serving Lester when we do find him.Thats actually good news.Its not always that easy.But Id hate for Lester to be located and then not get served because there are no sheriffs readily available and he disappears again before they can.So thats the plan?Maria asked.To wait until he shows himself?Im not sure theres another option.Im just trying to make the best out of a bad situation.Is that why you wanted to meet with me this morning?To tell me you couldnt find him?No, Margolis said.A couple of interesting bits of information turned up and I wanted to get your take on them.I thought you werent at liberty to talk about the investigation.Youre right, he said.Which means Ill have to limit some of what I tell you.Still, I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.Why?Because the more I look into this situation, the less it seems to add up.Im hoping that you can help me put the pieces together.Welcome to my world, Maria thought.Margolis went on.Regarding the situation last night.I told you I was looking into possible weapons violations.But like everything else in this case, what seemed obvious isnt.So lets start with this: Lester does not have a gun permit.Nor has he legally purchased a weapon, which I thought was great news for you.However, it turns out that Avery Manning, the father, does have a permit for a handgun purchased about a year ago.And?The problem is that Lester and Avery, father and son, live at the same address.Its not illegal to borrow someones gun if the weapon is properly permitted.So I cant make a case on that, unless Avery Manning didnt give permission.But there are even more complications.Such as?Avery Manning came to see me this morning.He let those words hang before continuing.Thats why I was late getting here, by the way.I figured it was better to meet with him before I talked to you.The story took yet another twist.What?The gun may not have been real.Excuse me?Margolis picked up his spoon and stirred his coffee as he went on.Let me start from the beginning, okay?We sit down and the first thing I think is that Dr.Manning looks like crap, which made sense as soon as he told me hed just driven in from Tennessee.He was clearly upset.He must have mowed through an entire pack of gum while we were sitting there, chewing and spitting out one piece after another.Although he didnt attempt to control the conversation, which surprised me based on the way youd described him.But anyway, I ask him what I can do for him, and he immediately says that Lester has left Plainview, and that he was worried Lester might come to see you.He begged me to warn you and to tell you that if he showed up you should call the police.He went on to say that Lester was in an acute delusional phase, and that hed been struggling with this disorder for years, yada yada yada pretty much all the same things hed told me before.But yesterday, he wasnt even sure if his son was in the hospital.Margolis took a sip of his coffee.He said the hospital called him as soon as the staff realized that Lester was missing, as hes the emergency contact.Apparently, when Lester didnt show up for his appointment with the social worker, the staff spent a couple of hours searching the hospital before they realized he must have left the grounds.Thats when they called Dr.Manning.How is that even possible?Its a psychiatric hospital.Dont they watch their patients?According to Dr.Manning, Lesters been there regularly enough to understand the routines and hes familiar with the staff.The administrator also emphasized that there was no reason not to trust Lester.Lester had entered the hospital voluntarily and hed never run off before.So free time comes along and theyre guessing that Lester just slipped away.After that, he either has use of someones car, or someone picked him up, and he made his way to Wilmington.And he obviously had a gun stashed somewhere along the way.Margolis shrugged.What can I say, hes paranoid.If he wanted to warn me, why didnt Dr.Manning call you as soon as he found out?He did, Margolis said, his expression letting her know he was just as surprised as she was.He left me a voice mail last night, but unfortunately, I didnt get around to listening to it until this morning, after Id already met with him.Even then, Im not sure how much good it would have done.The call came in after Lester had already been at your place.Maria nodded.Anyway, after we went over those things, I told Dr.Manning that Lester had not only shown up at your parents last night and confronted you, but that he had a gun.At that point, Dr.Manning became even more upset.Then, after hed seemed to calm down, he insisted to me that Lesters gun couldnt have been real.Of course hed say that.Thats what I thought, too.I asked him how he could be so sure.He said that he owned only two guns: an old shotgun hes had since he was a kid that he said might not even work, and the handgun I told you about, which he keeps in a locked case in the trunk of his car.He added that there was no way hed ever leave it at the house where Lester could get his hands on it.I know what I saw!I dont doubt that, but let me finish, Margolis said.Dr.Manning told me that while Lester didnt have a real gun, he owned a pellet gun.He said he bought it for Lester when he was a teenager, and hed assumed that it was in one of the boxes in the attic with Lesters other things.Its possible, he said, that his son may have retrieved it at some point in the past.So my question to you is whether its possible that Lester may have been holding a pellet gun.Maria tried to recall the gun but couldnt conjure up the necessary detail.I dont know, she admitted.It looked real to me.Thats not surprising.Same color, same size, it was dark out, and you were terrified.Who knows?But it might explain why Lester never raised it.Because he thought you may have noticed that the muzzle was too small.Maria thought about it before finally shaking her head.It still doesnt mean that Lesters gun wasnt real.He could have bought it at a gun show.Or bought it on the street.Its not impossible.True enough, Margolis conceded.As of now, Im not ruling anything out.And how do you know that Dr.Manning was telling the truth about his gun in the first place?Because he showed it to me after the interview, when he was leaving.And yes, it was in a locked case in his trunk.When Maria didnt respond, Margolis went on.Theres something else you should know.Whats that?Margolis reached into the file and pulled out an admission form from Plainview Psychiatric Hospital.He slid it across the table to Maria.Lester Manning was in the hospital the night your tires were slashed.I received this fax from Plainview this morning.You can see the date he entered the hospital.Even as Maria stared at the document in front of her, she didnt quite believe it.Are you sure this is real?Yes.Dr.Manning made the request while I was there, and the fax arrived a few minutes later, directly from the hospital.Couldnt Lester have sneaked out?Like he did yesterday?Not that night.According to their records, he was in his room all night.Staff checked on him every thirty minutes.Maria said nothing.In the silence, Margolis took a sip of his coffee.Which is part of the reason I wanted to meet with you.If someone else slashed your tires, who could it be?When I posed that question to Dr.Manning, he told me to look into Mark Atkinson.Why?Because Atkinson might be trying to frame Lester.That doesnt make any sense.Maybe unless Atkinson knew Lester and had a possible reason.And it just so happens that it might be the case.Lester was the one who introduced Cassie to Atkinson in the first place.It took a few beats for Maria to absorb this.Lester and Atkinson knew each other?They both work for the same janitorial company.Or used to, anyway.According to Dr.Manning, after Cassie died, Lester and Atkinson had a falling out.Lester confronted Atkinson about failing to protect Cassie when Laws showed up, called him a coward, and they got into a fight.Theres no record of it, but that doesnt mean anything.Most of the time, in situations like this, the police are never called.Long story short, according to Dr.Manning, Atkinson was pissed.And you know that for certain?Not about the fight.But its true that Lester and Atkinson worked together.After we talked yesterday, I spoke to Atkinsons mother again, and then a supervisor at the janitorial company.Thats what I meant, by the way, when I said that I was looking into different angles.Because something about the way Atkinson just up and left town bothered me as soon as I learned about it.I can kind of accept the idea that he ran off to meet the woman of his dreams or whatever  guys can be stupid like that  but no contact with his mom except for a couple of letters?That had been printed from a computer?No calls or texts to his mom or his friends?When all this with you just happens to be going on?It didnt sit right with me.I still dont understand why Atkinson would come after me, though.Like I told you, Ive never met the man.Is it possible that hes angry for the same reason you think Lester is?Because Laws got out of prison and killed Cassie?And he blames you?Maybe, she said slowly.But Lesters been the one following me.He sent the flowers and sent over the drink.Lesters the one who showed up at my house last night  Exactly, Margolis agreed.And all of this has made me wonder whether Dr.Manning was wrong about the relationship between Lester and Atkinson.If hes right, and Atkinson is trying to frame Lester, then how did he get Lester to play along so perfectly?Especially when you take last night into account?If you throw that idea out, however, it leaves us with a couple of other possibilities.The first is that Lester somehow knew that Atkinson was going to go after you, and he decided to join in.Of course, that raises the question as to how Lester would know what Atkinson was planning, which opens a whole new can of worms.If we put aside that idea, too, however, theres also a third possibility.Maria looked across the table at Margolis, almost afraid to hear what he was going to say next.What if, he finally offered, Lester and Atkinson are working together?And theyre providing alibis for each other?Maria, trying to absorb Margoliss questions, said nothing.I know what youre thinking, Margolis said.And it sounds crazy to me, too, but of the three explanations, its the only one that seems to make any sense at all.Im still not sure why you think Atkinson might be involved in the first place.Maybe Lester had some homeless guy or kid slash my tires and leave the note because he knew hed have the perfect alibi.Because everything else points to the fact that Lesters probably working alone.Not everything, Margolis said.See, the thing is, I ran the registrations on the cars near the park, just like Colin suggested.And one of them brought up a serious red flag.Why?Because the car in question is registered to Mark Atkinson.Does that make sense to you?Maria asked Colin after Margolis had left.About Lester and Atkinson working together?I dont know, Colin admitted.She shook her head.Its Lester.Alone.It has to be.Even to her ears, it sounded like she was trying to convince herself.And if they are working together, why is Atkinsons car at the park?How did they get away?Lester doesnt have a car.Like Margolis suggested last night, maybe he stole one.She shook her head.Its just so confusing.This whole thing is like one of those Russian nesting dolls.Open up one doll, and theres another one inside, and on and on.And what am I supposed to do now?What if the detective finds something that implicates Atkinson?Am I supposed to get a Fifty C on Atkinson, too?It might come to that.And what if they cant find Atkinson, either?Even his mother cant find him.What good would a Fifty C do if they cant serve it right away?Colin didnt answer, but he sensed that Maria didnt need him to.
