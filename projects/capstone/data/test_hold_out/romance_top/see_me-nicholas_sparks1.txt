  He hadnt been in Wilmington for more than a day before he knew it was the kind of city hed never settle in for good.It was too touristy, and the whole place seemed as though it had grown willy nilly, without any planning.While the historic district had the kind of porch fronted homes hed anticipated, with columns and detailed wainscoting and sprawling magnolia trees in the yards, those lovely neighborhoods gradually gave way to a commercial area of strip malls, convenience stores, chain restaurants, and car dealerships.Endless traffic snaked through the district, growing even more unbearable in the summers.But the grounds of UNC Wilmington had been a pleasant surprise.Somehow, hed imagined a campus heavy on the ugly architecture of the sixties and seventies.There were a few of those buildings, especially at the fringes of the university, but the central quads had proved to be an oasis of sorts  shaded walkways and manicured lawns, the Georgian columns and brick faades of Hoggard and Kenan Halls gleaming in the late afternoon sunlight.He admired the commons as well.There was a clock tower there and when hed first arrived, hed stared at the image reflected in the pond behind it, time itself mirrored and unreadable at a glance.As long as he had an open textbook in his lap, he could sit and watch the activities, almost invisible to the students who wandered around in their self absorbed trances.It was warm for late September, students lounging in shorts and tank tops, skin evident everywhere.He wondered if they dressed the same way for class.Like them, hed come to the campus to learn.Hed visited three times in three days, but there were still too many people around; too many possible memories, and he didnt want to be remembered.He debated whether to move to another area before finally deciding there was no reason.As far as he could tell, no one cared that he was here.He was close, so very close, but for now it was important to remain patient.He drew a long breath, holding it in before finally releasing it.On the walkways, he saw a pair of students walking to their classes, backpacks slung over their shoulders, but at this time of day, they were outnumbered by those classmates who were getting an early start to the weekend.Here and there, students were clustered in groups of three or four, talking and sipping from water bottles he suspected were filled with alcohol, while a couple of Abercrombie model lookalikes were tossing a Frisbee back and forth, their girlfriends chatting off to the side.He spotted a young man and woman arguing, the womans face flushed.He watched as she pushed at her boyfriend, creating space between them.He smiled at that, respecting her anger and the fact that unlike him, she wasnt compelled to hide the way she was feeling.Beyond the couple, another group of students played a game of touch football with the carefree abandon of those without real responsibility.He figured that many of the students he saw were planning to go out tonight and tomorrow night.Fraternity houses.Sorority houses.Bars.Clubs.For many of them, the weekend would start tonight, since many classes didnt even meet on Fridays.Hed been surprised when hed first learned that; with the cost of a college education so high, he would have thought that students would have been demanding more time in class with their professors, not three day weekends.Then again, he supposed the schedule suited both the students and the professors.Didnt everyone want things to be easy these days?To expend the least effort possible?To take shortcuts?Yes, he thought.Thats exactly what students were learning here.They were learning that hard decisions werent necessary, that making the right choice was unimportant, especially if it entailed extra work.Why study or try to change the world on a Friday afternoon when you could be out enjoying the sun?Shifting his eyes from left to right, he wondered how many of these students even gave much thought to the lives they were going to lead.Cassie used to, he remembered.She thought about the future all the time.She had plans.Shed mapped out her future by seventeen, but he could remember thinking that there was something tentative about the way shed talked about it, and hed had the sense that she didnt quite believe in herself or the face she showed to the world.Why else would she have made the decisions that she had?Hed tried to help her.Hed done the right thing, followed the law, filed reports with the police, even talked to the assistant district attorney.And up until that point, hed believed in societys rules.Hed held the nave view that good would triumph over evil, that danger could be corralled, that events could be controlled.Rules would keep a person safe from harm.Cassie had believed that, too  after all, wasnt that what kids were taught when they were young?Why else would parents say the things they did?Look both ways before you cross the road.Dont get into a car with a stranger.Brush your teeth.Eat your vegetables.Put on your seat belt.The list went on and on, rules to protect and save us.But rules could be dangerous, too, hed learned.Rules were about averages, not specifics, and since people were conditioned since childhood to accept rules, it was easy to follow them blindly.To trust in the system.It was easier not to worry about random possibilities.It meant that people didnt have to think about potential consequences, and when the sun was shining on Friday afternoons, they could play Frisbee without a care in the world.Experience was the most painful of teachers.For nearly two years, the lessons hed learned had been all he could think about.They had nearly consumed him, but slowly a clarity had begun to emerge.She had known about the danger.He had warned her what would happen.And in the end, shed cared only about following the rules, because it was convenient.Checking his watch, he saw it was finally time to go.He closed the textbook and rose from his spot, pausing to see if his movement had caused others to notice him.It hadnt.He set off then, crossing the commons, textbook beneath his arm.In his pocket was a letter hed written, and he veered toward the mailbox just outside the science building.He dropped the envelope through the slot and waited; a few minutes later, he spotted Serena emerging from the doors, precisely on time.He already knew much about her.These days, it seemed that every young person had Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and Snapchat, their lives on display for anyone who cared to put the pieces together.What they liked, who their friends were, where they spent their time.He already knew from a Facebook post that shed be having brunch at her parents house with her sister this Sunday, and as he watched her walking ahead of him, her dark brown hair tumbling past her shoulders, he noted again how beautiful she was.There was a natural grace about her, and she drew appreciative smiles from the guys she passed, though lost in conversation, she didnt seem to notice.She was walking with a short, heavy blonde, a friend from class.Theyd been in an education seminar together; he knew she wanted to become an elementary school teacher.Making plans, just like Cassie used to do.He kept his distance, energized by the power he felt in her presence.The power hed been husbanding for the last two years.She had no idea how close he was or what he could do.She never so much as glanced over her shoulder, but why should she?He was no one to her, just another face in the crowd  He wondered whether she was telling the blonde about her weekend plans, rattling off places to go or the people she intended to see.For his part, he planned to join the family for brunch on Sunday, though not as a guest.Instead, he would watch them from a nearby house, located in a neighborhood that was solidly middle class.The house had been empty for a month, the owners having lost it to foreclosure, but it was not yet up for sale.Though the locks on the doors were solid, hed been able to gain entry through a window along the side of the house without much trouble.He already knew that from the master bedroom, he could see onto their back porch and into the kitchen.On Sunday, hed watch the close knit family laugh and joke at the table on the porch.He knew something about each of them.Felix Sanchez was the classic immigrant success story; the newspaper article that was proudly laminated and on display at their restaurant chronicled how hed arrived in the country illegally as a teenager without speaking a word of English and begun working as a dishwasher in a local restaurant.Fifteen years later, after becoming an American citizen, hed saved enough money to open his own place in a strip mall  La Cocina de la Familia  serving his wife Carmens recipes.While she cooked, he did everything else, especially in the early years of the business.Little by little, their restaurant had expanded, and it was now regarded as one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city.Though there were more than fifteen employees, many were relatives, retaining the restaurants family character.Both parents still worked there, and Serena waited tables three times a week, just as her older sister, Maria, once had.Felix was a member of both the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotary Club, and he and his wife attended the seven a. m.  mass at St.Marys every Sunday, where he also served as a deacon.Carmen was a bit more of a mystery; he knew only that she was still more comfortable speaking Spanish than English and, like her husband, was proud of the fact that Maria had become the first college graduate in the family.As for Maria  He hadnt yet seen her in Wilmington.Shed been out of town for the last few days at a legal conference, but he knew her best of all.In the past, when shed lived in Charlotte, hed seen her many times.Hed talked to her.Hed tried to convince her she was wrong.And in the end, shed made him suffer as no one should ever suffer, and he hated her for what shed done.When Serena waved good bye to her friend and headed toward the parking lot, he continued walking straight.There was no reason to follow her, and he was content knowing that hed see the small but happy family on Sunday.Especially Maria.Maria was arguably even more beautiful than her sister, though frankly, both had been winners in the genetic lottery, with their dark eyes and nearly perfect bone structure.He tried to imagine them sitting close together at the table; despite the seven year age difference, many people might assume they were twins.And yet they were different.Where Serena was outgoing to a fault, Maria had always been quieter and driven, the more serious and studious of the two.Even so, they were close, best friends as well as sisters.He speculated that perhaps Serena saw traits in her sister that she wanted to emulate, and vice versa.He felt a frisson of excitement at the thought of the weekend, knowing it might be one of the last times the family would all be together with any semblance of normalcy.He wanted to see how they would act before tension began to infect their sweet happy family before the fear took hold.Before their lives were slowly  and then furiously  brought to ruin.Hed come here, after all, for a purpose, and that purpose had a name.Its name was vengeance.CHAPTER 1      Colin      C  olin Hancock stood over the sink in the bathroom at the diner, his shirt raised to better examine the bruise on his ribs.He guessed that it would deepen to a dark purple by the time he woke tomorrow.Even grazing the bruise made him wince, and while he knew from experience that the pain could be overridden for a while, he wondered whether it would hurt to breathe in the morning.His face, though  That might end up being a problem  not for him, but for others.Certainly his college classmates would stare at him with wide, frightened eyes and whisper about him behind his back, though he doubted that any of them would actually ask him what had happened.During the first few weeks at the university, most of his classmates had seemed nice enough, but it had been clear that none of them knew what to make of him, nor had any tried to speak to him.Not that it bothered him.For one thing, virtually all of them were six or seven years younger than he was, all were female, and he suspected that as far as recent life experiences went, they had little in common with him.In time, like everyone else, theyd end up drawing their own conclusions about him.Frankly, it wasnt worth worrying about.Still, he had to admit that he was particularly ghoulish right now.His left eye was swollen and the white of his right eye was a bloody red.There was a gash in the center of his forehead that had been glued back together, and the lead colored bruise on his right cheekbone resembled a birthmark.His split, swollen lips completed the picture.What he really needed was to put an ice pack on his face as soon as possible if he wanted the girls in his classes to be able to concentrate at all.But first things first; right now, he was starved and he needed fuel.He hadnt eaten much in the last two days, and hed wanted something fast, convenient, and  if possible  not entirely unhealthy.Unfortunately, at this time of night most places were already closed, so hed ended up at a run down diner just off the highway with bars on the windows, water stains on the walls, peeling linoleum on the floor, and booths held together with duct tape.But if the place had one saving grace, it was that none of the other customers cared how he looked when he made his way to the table.People who came to dives like this late at night were good at minding their own business.As far as he could tell, half the people here were trying to sober up after a night of hard drinking, while the other half  designated drivers, no doubt  were sobering up, too, only marginally less intoxicated.It was the kind of place where it would have been easy to get in trouble, and after hed turned into the gravel lot with Evan following in his Prius, hed half expected Evan to keep going.But Evan must have suspected the same thing about possible trouble.It was the only reason hed ever set foot in an establishment like this, especially at this time of night.Evan didnt exactly blend in with the late evening crowd here, what with his pink shirt, argyle socks, leather loafers, and neatly parted sandy blond hair.In fact, his Prius might as well have been a neon sign announcing that his goal was to get beaten up by the good old boys in pickup trucks whod just spent most of the night getting wasted.Colin turned on the faucet and wet his hands before bringing them to his face.The water was cold, exactly what he wanted.His skin felt like it was on fire.The marine hed fought had hit a lot harder than hed expected  and that didnt count the illegal blows  but who would have known by looking at him?Tall and thin, jarhead haircut, goofy eyebrows He shouldnt have underestimated the guy, and he told himself he wouldnt let it happen again.Either that, or hed end up scaring his classmates all year long, which just might ruin the whole college experience for them.Theres this super scary guy in my class with bruises all over his face and these crazy tattoos, Mom!, he could imagine them saying on the phone.And I have to sit right next to him!He shook the water from his hands.Leaving the restroom, he spotted Evan in the corner booth.Unlike him, Evan would have fit right in at the college.He still had a baby face, and as he approached, Colin wondered how many times a week he even had to shave.That took you long enough, Evan said as Colin slid into the booth.I was wondering if you got lost.Colin slouched against the vinyl cushion.I hope you werent too nervous all alone out here.Ha, ha.I have a question for you.Go ahead.How many times a week do you shave?Evan blinked.You were in the bathroom for ten minutes and thats what you were thinking about?I wondered about it while I was walking to the table.Evan stared at him.I shave every morning.Why?What do you mean, why?For the same reason you do.I dont shave every morning.Why are we even talking about this?Because I was curious and I asked and then you answered, Colin said.Ignoring Evans expression, he nodded toward the menus.Did you change your mind and decide to order?Evan shook his head.Not a chance.Youre not going to eat anything?No.Acid reflux?Actually, it has more to do with my suspicion that the last time the kitchen was inspected, Reagan was president.Its not that bad.Have you seen the cook?Colin glanced toward the grill behind the counter; the cook was right out of central casting, with a greasy apron straining to cover his ample gut, a long ponytail, and tattoos covering most of his lower arms.I like his tats.Gee, theres a surprise.Its the truth.I know.You always tell the truth.Thats part of your problem.Why is it a problem?Because people dont always want the truth.Like when your girlfriend asks if a particular outfit makes her look fat, you should tell her she looks beautiful.I dont have a girlfriend.Thats probably because you told the last one she looked fat without adding the beautiful part.Thats not what happened.You get my point, though.Sometimes, you need to stretch the truth to get along with people.Why?Because thats what normal people do.Thats the way society works.You cant just tell people whatever pops into your mind.It makes them uncomfortable or hurts their feelings.And just so you know, employers hate it.Okay.You dont believe me?I believe you.But you dont care.No.Because youd rather tell the truth.Yes.Why?Its what Ive learned works for me.Evan stayed silent for a moment.Sometimes I wish I could be more like that.Just tell my boss what I really think of him without caring about the consequences.You can.You choose not to.I need the paycheck.Thats an excuse.Maybe.Evan shrugged.But its what Ive learned works for me.Sometimes lying is necessary.For instance, if I told you that I saw a couple of roaches under the table while you were in the bathroom, you might feel the same way about eating here that I do.You know you dont have to stay, right?Ill be okay.So you say.You need to worry about yourself, not me.And besides, its getting late.Arent you heading to Raleigh with Lily tomorrow?First thing in the morning.Well go to service at eleven with my parents, and have brunch right afterwards.But unlike you, I wont have any trouble getting out of bed tomorrow morning.You look terrible, by the way.Thanks.Your eye, especially.It wont be as swollen tomorrow.Your other one.I think you popped a few blood vessels.Either that, or youre actually a vampire.I noticed that.Evan leaned back, spreading his arms slightly.Do me a favor, okay?Keep yourself hidden from the neighbors tomorrow.Id hate for them to think I had to get rough on you for being late on the rent or whatever.I dont want to get a bad reputation as a landlord.Colin smiled.He outweighed Evan by at least thirty pounds, and he liked to joke that if Evan had ever set foot in a gym, it was probably to conduct an audit.I promise to stay out of sight, Colin offered.Good.Considering my reputation and all.Just then, the waitress came by, dropping off a plate loaded with scrambled egg whites and ham, along with a gelatinous bowl of oatmeal.As Colin pulled the bowl closer, he glanced at Evans mug.What are you drinking?Hot water with lemon.Seriously?Its past midnight.If I had coffee, Id be up all night.Colin scooped a bit of oatmeal into his mouth before swallowing.Okay.What?No snide comment?Im just surprised they have lemon here.And Im surprised they do scrambled egg whites.Youre probably the first person in history whos ever even attempted to eat a healthy meal here.He reached for his water.By the way, what are you planning to do tomorrow?I have to change the ignition switch in my car.Its not starting the way it should.After that, Ill do the lawn and then hit the gym.Do you want to come with us?Brunch isnt really my thing.I wasnt inviting you to brunch.I doubt theyd even let you in the country club looking the way you do.But you could see your parents in Raleigh.Or your sisters.Its on the way to Chapel Hill.No.I just thought Id ask.Colin scooped a spoonful of oatmeal.Dont.Evan leaned back in his seat.There were a few great fights tonight, by the way.The one after yours was awesome.Yeah?A guy named Johnny Reese had a submission in the first round.Took the guy down like a stud, maneuvered him into a choke hold, and it was lights out.The dude moves like a cat.Your point is?Hes way better than you.Okay.Evan drummed his fingers on the table.So are you okay with how your fight went tonight?Its over.Evan waited.And?Thats it.Do you still think that what youre doing is a good idea?I mean you know.Colin scooped a bite of eggs onto his fork.Im still here with you, arent I?Half an hour later, Colin was back on the highway.The clouds that had been threatening a storm for the last few hours finally obliged, releasing a torrent of wind and rain punctuated by lightning and thunder.Evan had left a few minutes before Colin did, and as Colin settled in behind the wheel of the Camaro hed been restoring over the last few years, he found his thoughts drifting to his friend.Hed known Evan as long as he could remember.When Colin was young, his family used to spend summers at a beach cottage in Wrightsville Beach, and Evans family lived right next door.Theyd passed long, sun drenched days walking the beach, playing catch, fishing, and either surfing or riding boogie boards.More often than not, theyd spent the night at each others houses, until Evans family moved to Chapel Hill and Colins life went completely in the toilet.The facts were fairly straightforward: He was the third child and only son of wealthy parents with a fondness for nannies and absolutely no desire for a third child.He was a colicky baby and then a high energy child with a raging case of ADHD, the kind of kid who threw regular temper tantrums, couldnt focus, and found it impossible to sit still.He drove his parents crazy at home, ran off one nanny after another, and struggled endlessly in school.He had a great teacher in third grade who made things better for a while, but in fourth grade, he started going downhill again.He got in one fight after another on the playground and was nearly held back.It was around that time that he came to be regarded as having serious issues, and in the end, not knowing what else to do, his parents shipped him off to military school, hoping the structure would do him good.His experience that first year was horrific, and he was expelled halfway through the spring semester.From there, he was sent to another military school in a different state, and over the next few years, he expended his energies in combat sports  wrestling, boxing, and judo.He took his aggression out on others, sometimes with too much enthusiasm, often just because he wanted to.He cared nothing about grades or discipline.Five more expulsions and five different military schools later, he graduated, just barely, as an angry and violent young man with no plans for his life and no interest in finding any.He moved back in with his parents and seven bad years followed.He watched his mother cry and listened to his father plead with him to change, but he ignored them.He worked with a therapist at his parents insistence, but he continued his downward spiral, subconscious self destruction his primary goal.The therapists words, not his, though he now agreed with them.Whenever his parents kicked him out of the main house in Raleigh, hed crash at the familys beach cottage, biding his time before returning home, the cycle beginning anew.When Colin was twenty five, he was given one final chance to make changes in his life.Unexpectedly, he did just that.And now here he was, in college with plans to spend the next few decades in the classroom, hoping to be a mentor to children, which would make no sense at all to most people.Colin knew there was an irony to his wanting to spend the rest of his life in school  a place hed always hated  but thats the way it was.He didnt dwell on the irony and he generally didnt dwell on the past.He wouldnt have been thinking of any of these things at all if it hadnt been for Evans comment about visiting his parents tomorrow.What Evan still didnt grasp was that simply being in the same room as them was stressful for both Colin and his parents  especially if the visit wasnt planned well in advance.Had he shown up unexpectedly, he knew theyd sit uncomfortably in the living room trying to make small talk while memories of the past filled the air between them like a poisonous gas.Hed feel waves of disappointment and judgment radiating out from them, apparent in the things they said or didnt say, and who needed that?He didnt, and neither did they.In the last three years, hed tried to keep his infrequent visits to about an hour, almost always on the holidays, an arrangement that seemed to suit them all.His older sisters, Rebecca and Andrea, had tried to talk to him about making amends to his parents, but hed shut down those conversations the same way hed done with Evan.Their lives with their parents, after all, had been different from his.Theyd both been wanted, while hed been a big fat whoops seven years later.He knew they meant well, but he didnt have a lot in common with them.Both of them were college graduates and married with kids.They lived in the same upscale neighborhood as their parents and played tennis on the weekends.The older hed gotten, the more hed come to acknowledge that the choices theyd made in their own lives had been a lot smarter than his own.Then again, they didnt have serious issues.He knew that his parents, like his sisters, were essentially good people.It had taken him years in therapy to accept the fact that hed been the one with the problems, not them.He no longer blamed his mother and father for the things that had happened to him or for what they had or hadnt done; if anything, he considered himself a lucky son of two incredibly patient people.So what if hed been raised by nannies?So what if his folks had finally thrown in the towel and shipped him off to military school?When hed really needed them, when other parents probably would have given up, theyd never lost hope that he could turn his life around.And theyd put up with his crap for years.Serious crap.Theyd ignored the drinking and the pot smoking and the music cranked way too loud at all hours; theyd put up with the parties he threw whenever they went out of town that left the house in shambles.Theyd overlooked the bar fights and multiple arrests.They never contacted the authorities when he broke into the beach cottage, even though he did serious damage to that place as well.Theyd bailed him out more times than he could remember and paid his legal bills, and three years ago  when Colin was facing a long prison sentence after a bar fight in Wilmington  his dad had pulled some strings to strike a deal that would clear his criminal record entirely.If, of course, Colin didnt screw it up.As part of his probation, Colin had been required to spend four months at an anger management treatment facility in Arizona.Upon his return and because his parents wouldnt let him stay at their home, hed crashed again at the beach cottage, which by then was for sale.Hed also been ordered to meet regularly with Detective Pete Margolis from the Wilmington police department.The man whom Colin had beaten in the bar was a longtime confidential informant of Margoliss, and as a result of the fight, a high profile case Margolis was working on had gone suddenly south.Consequently, Margolis hated Colin with a passion.Having argued strongly against the deal in the first place, he then insisted on monitoring Colin regularly and at random, like a makeshift probation officer.Finally, the deal stipulated that if Colin was arrested again, for anything, the entirety of his original record would be reinstated and hed automatically be sentenced to prison for nearly a decade.Despite the requirements, despite having to deal with Margolis, who plainly itched to place him in handcuffs, it was a great deal.An unbelievable deal, and it was all thanks to his father even if he and Colin had trouble speaking these days.Colin was technically banned from ever setting foot in the house again, though his dad had softened on that particular stance lately.Being permanently kicked out of the house after hed returned from Arizona and then watching from the street as new owners took possession of the beach cottage had forced Colin to reevaluate his life.Hed ended up sleeping at friends places back in Raleigh, drifting from one couch to the next.Little by little, hed come to the conclusion that if he didnt change his life, hed self destruct entirely.The environment there wasnt good for him, and his circle of friends was as out of control as he was.With nowhere else to go, hed driven back to Wilmington and surprised himself by showing up at Evans door.Evan had been living there after graduating from North Carolina State and had been equally surprised to see his old friend.Cautious and a bit nervous, too, but Evan was Evan, and he had no problem with Colin staying at his place for a while.It took some time to earn Evans trust again.By that point, their lives had diverged.Evan was a lot more like Rebecca and Andrea, a responsible citizen whose only experience with jail was what hed seen on television.He worked as an accountant and financial planner, and in keeping with the fiscally prudent ideals of his profession, hed also purchased a house with a first floor apartment and separate entrance to help lower his mortgage payments, an apartment that happened to be vacant when Colin had shown up.Colin hadnt intended to stay long, but one thing led to another and when hed gotten a job tending bar, hed moved in downstairs for good.Three years later, he was still paying rent to the best friend he had in the world.So far, it was working out well.He mowed the lawn and trimmed the bushes and paid a reasonable rent in return.He had his own space with his own entrance, but Evan was right there, too, and Evan was exactly what Colin needed in his life right now.Evan wore a suit and tie to work, he kept his tastefully decorated house spotless, and he never drank more than two beers when he went out.He was also just about the nicest guy in the world, and he accepted Colin, faults and all.And  for God knows what reason  he believed in him, even when Colin knew he didnt always deserve it.Lily, Evans fiance, was pretty much cut from the same cloth.Though she worked in advertising and had her own condo at the beach  her parents had bought it for her  she spent enough time at Evans to have become an important part of Colins life.It had taken her a while to warm up to him  when theyd first met, Colin had been sporting a blond Mohawk and had piercings in both ears, and their initial conversation had centered around a bar fight in Raleigh where the other guy had ended up in the hospital.For a while, she simply couldnt comprehend how Evan could ever be friends with him.A Charleston debutante whod attended college at Meredith, Lily was prim and polite, and the phrases she used were a throwback to an earlier era.She was also just about the most drop dead gorgeous girl Colin had ever seen, and it was no wonder that Evan was putty in her hands.With her blond hair and blue eyes and an accent that sounded like honey even when she was angry, she seemed like the last person in the world who would give Colin a chance.And yet, she had.And like Evan, she had eventually come to believe in him.It had been Lily whod suggested that he start taking classes at the junior college two years ago, and it had been Lily whod tutored him in the evenings.And on two separate occasions, it had been Lily and Evan who had kept Colin from making the kind of impulsive mistake that might have landed him in prison.He loved her for those things, just as he loved the relationship between her and Evan.Hed long since decided that if anyone ever threatened the two of them in any way, he would handle it, no matter what the consequences, even if it meant hed have to spend the rest of his life behind bars.But all good things come to an end.Isnt that what people said?The life hed lived for the last three years was going to change, if only because Evan and Lily were engaged, with plans for a spring wedding already in the works.While theyd both insisted that Colin could continue to live in the downstairs apartment after they were married, he also knew theyd spent the previous weekend walking through model homes in a subdivision closer to Wrightsville Beach, with homes that featured the kind of double porches common in Charleston.They both wanted kids, they both wanted the whole white picket fence thing, and Colin had no doubt that within a year, Evans current house would be for sale.After that, Colin would be on his own again, and while he knew it wasnt fair to expect Evan and Lily to be responsible for him, he sometimes wondered whether they were aware of how important theyd become to him in the last few years.Like tonight, for instance.He hadnt asked Evan to come to the fight; that had been Evans idea.Nor had he asked Evan to sit with him while he ate.But Evan probably suspected that had he not done those things, Colin might have ended up at a bar instead of the diner, unwinding with shots instead of midnight breakfast.And though Colin worked as a bartender, being on the other side of the bar didnt exactly work for him these days.Finally exiting the highway, Colin steered onto a winding county road, loblolly pine and red oak mingling on either side, kudzu playing no favorites between the two.It was less a shortcut than an attempt to avoid an endless series of stoplights.Lightning continued to strike, turning the clouds silver and illuminating the surroundings in otherworldly strobes.The rain and wind intensified, the wipers barely keeping the windshield clear, but he knew this road well.He eased into one of its many blind curves before instinctively stomping on the brakes.Up ahead, a car with storage racks across the roof was halfway off the road at a cockeyed angle, its hazards flashing.The trunk stood propped open to the elements.As the Camaro slowed, Colin felt the rear fishtail slightly before the tires caught again.He merged into the oncoming lane to give the car a wide berth, thinking that the guy couldnt have picked a worse time and place to break down.Not only was the storm limiting visibility, but drunks like the ones back at the diner would be setting out for home right about now, and he could imagine one of them taking the corner too fast and plowing into the back of the car.Not good, he thought.It was definitely an accident waiting to happen, but at the same time, it wasnt his business.It wasnt his job to rescue strangers, and he probably wouldnt be much help anyway.He understood the engine in his car, but only because the Camaro was older than he was; modern engines had more in common with computers.Besides, the driver had no doubt already called for help.As he rolled slowly past the stopped car, however, he noticed the rear tire was flat and behind the trunk, a woman  soaked to the bone in jeans and a short sleeved blouse  was struggling to remove the spare tire from its compartment.Lightning flashed, a long series of flickering camera strobes that captured her mascara streaked distress.In that instant, he realized that her dark hair and wide set eyes reminded him of one of the girls in his classes, and his shoulders slumped.A girl?Why did it have to be a girl in trouble out here?For all he knew, it was the girl in his class, and he couldnt very well pretend he hadnt noticed that she needed help.He really didnt need this right now, but what choice did he have?With a sigh, he pulled over to the side of the road, leaving some distance between her car and his.He turned on his hazards and grabbed his jacket from the backseat.By then the rain was coming down in sheets, instantly soaking him as he exited, like the diagonal spray of an outdoor shower.Running a hand through his hair, he took a deep breath and then started toward her car, calculating how quickly he could change the tire and be on the road again.Need a hand?he called.Surprising him, she didnt say anything.Instead, staring at him with stricken eyes, she let go of the tire and began slowly backing away.CHAPTER 2      Maria      I  n the past, when shed worked in the Mecklenburg County district attorneys office, Maria Sanchez had been in the courtroom with any number of criminals, some of whom had been charged with the kinds of violent crimes that kept her awake at night.Shed had nightmares about various cases and had been threatened by a sociopath, but the simple fact was that shed never been quite as frightened back then as she felt right now on this deserted stretch as that car, driven by that guy, suddenly pulled to the side of the road.It didnt matter that she was twenty eight, or that shed graduated summa cum laude from UNC Chapel Hill, or that shed gone to law school at Duke.It didnt matter that shed been a rising star in the district attorneys office before finding other work at one of the best legal firms in Wilmington, or that until that moment, shed always had a pretty good handle on her emotions.As soon as he stepped out of the car, all those truths went out the window and the only thing she could think was that she was a young woman all alone in the middle of nowhere.When he began to walk toward her, panic flooded through her.Im going to die out here, she suddenly realized, and no ones ever going to find my body.Moments earlier, when his car had slowly drifted past hers, shed seen him staring at her  almost leering, like he was sizing her up  and her first thought was that hed been wearing a mask, which was terrifying enough, but way less scary than the sudden realization that shed actually seen his face.It was bruised on both sides; one eye was swollen shut, the other one bright red and bloody.She was pretty sure that even more blood was dripping down his forehead, and it had been all she could do not to start screaming.But for whatever reason, not a sound escaped her.For the love of God, she remembered thinking as soon as hed passed, please keep going.Whatever you do, please dont stop.But obviously God hadnt been listening.Why would God intervene to keep her from ending up dead in a ditch out in the middle of nowhere?He wouldnt.Instead, Hed decided to have the guy pull over, and now a man with a mangled face was gliding toward her like something out of a low budget horror film.Or prison, from which hed just escaped, because the guy was positively ripped, and wasnt that what prisoners did?Lift weights all the time?His haircut was severe, almost military style  the signature of one of the gangs in prison shed heard about?The ratty black concert T shirt didnt help, nor did the torn up jeans, and the way he was holding his jacket freaked her out.In this storm, why wasnt he wearing it?Maybe he was using it to hide  A knife.Or, God forbid, a gun  A squeak escaped her throat and her mind began racing through options as she tried to figure out what to do.Toss the tire at him?She couldnt even get the thing out of the trunk.Scream for help?There was no one nearby, not a single car had passed in the last ten minutes, and shed left her cell phone God knows where or she wouldnt have been trying to change the tire in the first place.Run?Maybe, but the liquid ease with which he moved suggested hed easily catch her.The only thing she could do was get back into the car and lock the doors, but he was already right there, and there was no way to get past him  Need a hand?It was the sound of his voice that jolted her out of her trance.Letting go of the tire, she began backing away, focusing only on creating distance between the two of them.Lightning flashed again and she noticed a blankness in his expression, almost like something elemental was missing in his personality, the piece that signaled that it wasnt okay to rape and kill women.What do you want with me?she finally choked out.I dont want anything, he answered.Then what are you doing here?I thought you might need some help changing your tire.Im fine, she said.I can handle it myself.He looked from her to the flat tire, then back to her again.Okay.Good night, he said.Wheeling around, he started back toward his car, his figure suddenly receding.His reaction was so unexpected that for a second she felt paralyzed.He was leaving?Why was he leaving?She was glad about that  actually, she was thrilled about that  and yet, and yet  Im having trouble getting the tire out of the trunk!she said, hearing the panic in her own voice.He turned on his heel as he reached his car.Seems like it.He reached for his door and pulled it open, ready to climb in   Wait!she suddenly cried.He squinted at her through the downpour.Why?he called back.Why?She wasnt sure shed heard him right.But then again, shed told him she didnt need any help.And she didnt, except that she did, but it wasnt as though she could call anyone, and with her thoughts racing and jumbled, the next words spilled out involuntarily.Do you have a phone?she shouted.He closed some of the gap between, stopping when he could be heard without shouting, but not getting too close.Thank God.Yes, he answered.She shifted from one foot to the other, thinking Now what?I lost my phone, she said.I mean, I didnt lose lose it.She knew she was rambling, but the way he kept staring at her made the words impossible to stop.Its either at the office or I left it at my parents, but I wont know for sure until I get to my MacBook.Okay.He added nothing else; instead, he stood unmoving, his eyes steady on hers.I use that Find My iPhone thing.The app, I mean.I can track my phone because its synced with the computer.Okay.Well?Well what?Can I borrow yours for a minute?I want to call my sister.Sure, he answered.He tucked the phone into the folds of his jacket and as he began to approach, she reflexively took another step backward.He placed the jacket on the hood of her car and gestured at it.She hesitated.He was definitely odd, but she appreciated the fact that hed stepped away.She hurried to the bundle and found his iPhone tucked inside, the same model as hers.When she pressed the button, the screen lit up and sure enough, he was getting service.But it wouldnt do any good unless  Five six eight one, he offered.Youre giving me your code?You cant access the phone without it, he noted.Arent you worried about giving it to a stranger?Are you going to steal my phone?She blinked.No.Of course not.Then Im not worried.She wasnt sure what to say to that, but whatever.She typed in the code with trembling fingers and dialed her sister.By the third ring, she knew shed get Serenas voice mail.Maria did her best to keep her frustration in check as she left a message, explaining what had happened to the car and asking her sister to come pick her up.She tucked the phone back into the jacket on the hood and then stepped away, watching him.No answer?he asked.Shes coming.Okay.When the lightning flashed again, he motioned toward the rear of her car.While youre waiting for her, do you want me to change your tire?She opened her mouth to again decline his offer, but who knew when  or if  Serena would get her message?And then there was the fact that shed never actually changed a tire in her life.Instead of answering, she let out a breath, trying to keep the tremor from her voice.Can I ask you a question?Yes.What what happened to your face?I was in a fight.She waited a few beats before finally realizing he wasnt going to add anything else.Thats it?No further explanation?His demeanor was so utterly foreign, she wasnt sure what to make of it.As he stood in place, obviously waiting for the answer to his earlier question, she glanced at the trunk, wishing she actually knew how to change a tire.Yes, she finally said.If you wouldnt mind, Id love some help changing the tire.Okay.He nodded.She watched as he reached for the bundle on the hood and tucked his phone back into his pocket before slipping his jacket on.Youre afraid of me, he said.What?Youre afraid Im going to hurt you.When she said nothing, he went on.I wont, but whether you believe that is up to you.Why are you telling me this?Because if Im going to change your tire, Im going to have to approach the trunk.Which means Ill be approaching you, too.Im not afraid of you, she lied.Okay.Im not.Okay, he said again, then started toward her.She felt her heart squeeze as he passed within arms reach of her, only to feel foolish when he walked right past without slowing.He unscrewed something, then lifted the spare tire out and set it aside before he disappeared behind the trunk again, no doubt to retrieve the jack.One of us needs to move your car onto the road, he said.It needs to be level before I get the jack going, otherwise the car might slip.But Ive got a flat tire.He peeked around the side, jack in hand.It wont hurt the car.Just go slow.But it will block most of the lane.Its blocking half the lane already.He had a point there but  But what if that was all part of his plan?To distract her somehow?To get her to turn her back?A plan that included letting me use his phone?And removing the tire from the trunk?Rattled and self conscious, she got into the car and started the engine, slowly but surely edging it back onto the road and setting the emergency brake.By the time she opened the door, he was rolling the spare toward the rear tire, lug wrench in hand.You can stay in the car if you want, he said.This shouldnt take long.She debated before closing the door, then spent several minutes watching in the side mirror as he continued to loosen the bolts before sliding the jack into place.A moment later, she could feel the car lifting slightly, bouncing its way slowly upward and then stopping.She watched as he finished unscrewing the bolts before sliding the tire off, just as the storm began to intensify, rain blowing in gusty sheets.The spare went on quickly, along with the bolts, and then all at once, the car was being lowered again.He placed the flat tire back in her trunk along with the jack and the lug wrench, and she felt him gently push the trunk closed.And just like that, it was over.Still, she startled a little when he tapped on her window.She lowered the glass and rain began to spit through the opening.With his face still shadowed, it was almost possible to see past the bruises and the swelling and the bloody eye.Almost, but not entirely.Youre good to go, he shouted over the gale, but you should probably get the tire fixed or replace it sooner rather than later.Your spare isnt meant to be used permanently.She nodded, but before she could thank him, he had already turned and was jogging toward his car.He jerked his door open and slid behind the wheel.She heard the roar of his engine and then  before she knew it  she was alone on the road again, albeit now in a car that would get her home.I heard the phone ring, but I didnt recognize the number so I let it go to voice mail, Serena said in between sips of orange juice.Beside her at the table on the back porch, Maria nursed a cup of coffee, the morning sunlight already warming the air.Sorry about that.Well, next time, just answer, okay?Cant do that.Serena smiled.What if it was some crazy person trying to reach me?That was the problem!I was with a crazy person and I needed you to rescue me.It doesnt sound like it.He sounds like a nice guy.Maria glared at her over the rim of her coffee mug.You didnt see him.Trust me.Ive seen scary people, and he was beyond scary.He told you hed been in a fight  And thats the point.Hes obviously violent.But he wasnt the least bit violent toward you  you said he didnt even go near you at first.And then he let you borrow his phone.And after that, he changed your tire and then got back in his car and drove away.Youre missing the point.What point?That you shouldnt judge a book by its cover?Im being serious here!Serena laughed.Wow, someones touchy.And you know Im just teasing you.If it was me out there, I probably would have peed my pants.Broken car, deserted road, no phone, blood on some strangers face its like every girls worst nightmare.Exactly.Did you ever find your phone?Its at the office.Probably still on my desk.You mean its been there since Friday?And you didnt realize you didnt have it until Saturday night?So?I guess not too many people call you, huh?Ha, ha.Serena shook her head, then reached for her phone.I cant live without mine, just so you know.She snapped a quick photo of Maria.Whats that for?Instagram.Seriously?Serena was already tapping away.Dont worry.Itll be funny, she added before presenting the image and caption.Maria, after surviving Nightmare on Dark Street.Youre not going to post that, are you?Already did.Serena winked.Youve got to stop posting about me.Im serious.What if one of my clients finds it?Then blame me.She shrugged.Wheres Dad, by the way?Hes still walking Copo, she said.Copo was a female, nearly all white shih tzu.After Serena had moved to the dorms, she and Maria had returned home one Christmas to find that their parents had purchased a dog.Now Copo went practically everywhere with them: to the restaurant  where she had her own bed in the office  to the supermarket, even to the accountant.Copo was far more spoiled than either of the girls had ever been.I still cant get over it, Serena muttered.They love that dog.Ya think?Did you notice the rhinestone collar Mom bought?I almost gagged.Be nice.I am being nice!Serena said.I just never pictured them owning a dog in the first place.We never had one growing up, and I begged them for one for years.I even promised to take care of it.Thats because they knew you wouldnt.I might not have skipped a grade and gone to college when I was seventeen like you, but Im pretty sure I could have handled a dog.And Ill have you know that Im in the running for the Charles Alexander Scholarship next year.Mmm, right.Maria raised a skeptical eyebrow.Im serious.Its for bilingual education majors.I filled out the application, wrote an essay, got recommendations from two of my professors and everything.Its sponsored by a private foundation, and I have an interview with the chairman next Saturday.So there.She crossed her arms.Wow.Thats great.Dont tell Dad, though.I want to surprise him.Hed be thrilled if you won.I know, right?Just think how many more collars theyd be able to buy Copo if he didnt have to pay tuition.Maria laughed.Inside, they could hear their mother humming to herself in the kitchen, the smell of huevos rancheros drifting through the open window.But anyway, Serena went on, back to last night.Why were you out so late?Thats way past your normal bedtime.Maria scowled at her sister before figuring that she might as well get it over with.Actually, I was on a date.No way.Whats the big deal?Nothing.I just thought that youd made the decision to be celibate.Why would you say that?Hello?Did you forget who I was talking to?I go out.You might paddleboard, but you dont go out at night.Instead, you work.You read.You watch bad TV.You dont even go dancing anymore, and you used to love that.And I tried to get you to come to that warehouse with me, remember?With the salsa dancing on Saturday nights?As I recall, you said there were a lot of creepy guys there.But I also had a lot of fun.And unlike you, Im terrible at dancing.Not all of us are in college, you know, with classes that start at noon and Fridays off.Some of us have responsibilities.Yeah, yeah, Ive heard that before, Serena said, waving it off.I take it you didnt get lucky?Maria peeked over her shoulder toward the partially open window, making sure her mother wasnt listening.Serena rolled her eyes.Youre an adult, you know.You dont have to hide your social life from Mom and Dad anymore.Yeah, well, weve always been a little different in that way.What?You think I tell them everything?I hope not.Serena stifled a giggle.Sorry your date didnt work out.How do you know?Maybe it did.I dont think so, Serena said, shaking her head.Otherwise you wouldnt have been heading home alone.Oops, Maria thought.Serena had always been quick thinking, but more than that, she was endowed with a common sense that sometimes eluded Maria.Hello?Serena added.Anyone home?I was asking about your date.I dont think hell be calling me.Serena feigned compassion, though her amused cynicism was apparent.Why?Did you bring your computer and work the whole time?No.And it wasnt me.It was just bad.Talk to me, big sister.Tell me all about it.Maria surveyed the backyard, reflecting that Serena was the only person in the world she could really talk to.Theres really not that much to tell.For starters, I didnt plan on having a date in the first place   No!You?Do you want to hear this or not?My mistake.Serena grinned.Go on.You remember Jill, right?My friend from work?Super smart, coming up on forty and dying to get married, funny as hell?The one who came over for brunch and scooped Copo up and almost gave Dad a heart attack?Yes.No, I dont remember her.Anyway, Maria said, we were having lunch a few days ago and she convinced me to join her and her boyfriend, Paul, for dinner, after I got back from the conference.But unbeknownst to me, it turns out that they had also invited one of Pauls friends from work to join us, and   Wait, back up.Was the guy hot?He was definitely handsome.But the problem was, he knew it.He was rude and arrogant and he flirted with the waitress all night long.I think he even got her phone number while I was sitting beside him.Classy.Jill was as mortified as I was, but the strange thing was, Im not sure that Paul even noticed.Maybe it was the wine or whatever, but he kept saying that the four of us should head out to a club afterwards and that he was so glad we were getting along, that he just knew wed be perfect for each other.Which is strange, because hes not normally like that.Usually hes quiet and Jill and I do all the talking.Maybe he just likes his friend.Or maybe he thought that you and his friend would make pretty babies and you might name one after him.Despite herself, Maria laughed.Maybe.But anyway, I dont think Im his type.Im pretty sure hed be more comfortable with someone  When Maria trailed off, Serena finished.Dumber?I was thinking blonder, like the waitress.Yeah, well, just so you know, thats always been part of your problem when it comes to guys.Youre too smart.And to guys, thats kind of intimidating.Not all guys.Luis and I were together for over two years.Were together, Serena said.Those are the operative words.And just so you know?He may have been sexy as hell, but Luis was a total loser.He wasnt that bad.Dont start getting all nostalgic about the good things about him.It wasnt like you ever had a future with him and you know it.Maria nodded, knowing Serena was right but indulging momentarily in a bit of nostalgia anyway before shutting it down.Yeah, well, live and learn.Im just glad you decided to start dating again.I didnt.Jill and Paul decided for me.Whatever.You need to be  While Serena searched for the right words, Maria suggested, More like you?Why not?Going out, enjoying life, making friends?It beats working all the time.How would you know?You only work a couple of shifts a week.Good point.Im just making an assumption based on your lack of a social life.Believe it or not, I actually like working.Ill make sure to put that on your tombstone, Serena said.Hows work going, by the way?Maria shifted in her seat, wondering how much to say.Its all right.You just said you liked it.I do, but  Let me guess the conference, right?The one you went to with your boss?When Maria nodded, Serena went on.Was it as awful as you thought it might be?Not exactly awful, but  Did he hit on you?Sort of, Maria admitted.But it wasnt anything I couldnt handle.This is the guy whos married?With three kids?Thats the one.You need to tell him to knock it off.Threaten him with sexual harassment, or whatever.Its more complicated than that.For now, its probably better for me if I just try to ignore it.When a slight smirk began to play across Serenas lips, Maria went on.What?I was just thinking that you really have a way with men.Your old boyfriend cheated on you, your latest date flirts with other girls, and meanwhile, your boss wont stop hitting on you.Welcome to my world.Of course, its not all bad.You met a nice guy last night.The kind of guy who helps a woman in her time of need, despite a raging storm  When Maria scowled, Serena laughed and went on.I really wish I could have seen your face.It wasnt pretty.And yet here you are, safe and sound, Serena reminded her.And Im happy about that, if only so that you have continued access to my wisdom.You really need to work on your self esteem issues, Maria said sourly.I know, right?But seriously, Im glad you moved back to town.These brunches would be deadly if you werent here.Having you around gives Mom and Dad someone else to worry about.Im glad I can be of service to you.I appreciate it.And besides, weve had a chance to get to know each other better.Weve always known each other.You went off to college when I was ten.And I came home almost every weekend, and spent every vacation here.Thats true.You were kind of wimpy like that.For the first couple of years, you were so homesick, youd cry all weekend.It was hard to be so far from home.Why do you think I go to college here?In that way, Im almost as smart as you are.Youre smart.You might get a scholarship, remember?Im not smart like you.But thats okay.Itll make it much easier to find a guy in the end  not that Im interested in anything serious.But listen, if you want, Id be happy to keep a lookout for you.I meet guys all the time.College guys?Some of them might just like an older woman.Youre insane.I dont know.I tend to have pretty good taste.Are you referring to Steve?Were just going out.Its not serious yet.But he seems like a nice guy.He even volunteers at the Humane Society, doing pet adoptions on Sundays.Do you like him?You mean like like?Or just like?What?Are we in middle school now?Serena laughed.Im not sure how I feel yet.But hes cute, which gives me more time to find out.When do I get to meet him?Well lets see where it goes.Because if youre going to meet him, then Mom and Dad will want to meet him, and then I lose control of the whole situation.No matter what happens after that, hell think that I think its serious, and unlike you, Im too young to settle down.I dont want to settle down yet, either.Maybe.But you definitely need a date.Would you stop?Okay, fine.You dont need a date.What you need is to get lucky.When Maria didnt bother responding, Serena giggled.Touched a nerve, huh?she chirped.Okay, never mind.Whats on your agenda today?After we get out of here?Are you going paddleboarding again?I was thinking about it.Alone?Unless you want to try it again.Not a chance.I still dont understand why you like it so much.Its not like dancing.Its boring.Its good exercise.And its peaceful.Didnt I just say that?Serena asked.Maria smiled.How about you?What are your plans?Im going to take a nice long nap.And then, after that, Ill play it by ear.I hope you find something to do.Id hate for you to miss a wild Sunday night on Greek row.Now, now jealousys an ugly thing, Serena said.She hooked her thumb toward the windows.Dads finally back and Im starved.Lets go eat.Later that afternoon, while Serena was no doubt sound asleep, Maria was on her paddleboard in Masonboro Sound, a place that had long since become her favorite spot to spend a weekend afternoon.Masonboro Island was the largest barrier island along the southern coast of the state, and while she sometimes navigated to the Atlantic side of the island, most of the time she preferred the glassy waters of the marsh.As always, the wildlife was spectacular.In her first hour on the water, shed seen ospreys, pelicans, and egrets and had taken what she thought were some pretty good photographs.In June, for her birthday, shed treated herself to a high quality waterproof camera, and though it had been a financial stretch and she was still paying off the credit card bill, she hadnt yet regretted it.While they wouldnt end up in National Geographic, a few of her photos had been good enough to hang on the walls of her condominium, which was a prudent decorating option since she could barely afford the condo, either.But out here, it was easy to think about those things without necessarily worrying about them.Though shed only taken up paddleboarding since shed moved back to Wilmington, it had the same effect on her that dancing used to have.Shed reached the point where keeping her balance was effortless and the steady paddling rhythm melted the stress away.Usually, within a few minutes of being on the water she was left with the sensation that all was right with the world.It was a warm, relaxing glow that started in her neck and shoulders before spreading to the rest of her body, and by the time she was in the shower after returning home, shed feel ready to face yet another week in the office.Serena was wrong about paddleboarding.It wasnt boring; it was necessary these days for her mental health, and she had to admit it wasnt half bad for her figure, either.In the last year, shed become toned in places she didnt even know could be toned, and shed had to have her suits altered because theyd grown too loose in the waist and butt.Not that it would matter.Serena might have been wrong about paddleboarding, but she had been right about Marias run of bad luck in her love life, starting with Luis.He was the first guy shed ever been serious about, the first guy shed ever really loved.Theyd been friends for almost a year before theyd finally started going out, and on the surface, they had a lot in common.Like her, he was the child of Mexican immigrants and intended to become a lawyer; like her, he enjoyed dancing, and after theyd been dating for a couple of years, it had been easy for her to imagine a future with him.Luis, on the other hand, had made it clear that he was content to continue going out  and sleeping with her  as long as she never expected anything more than that.Even bringing up the subject of marriage had freaked him out, and while shed initially tried to convince herself that it didnt really matter, shed known deep down that it did.Still, in the end, the breakup had been a surprise; hed simply called one evening and told her it was over.Shed eventually tried to console herself with the facts that they wanted different things in life and Luis simply wasnt ready for the kind of commitment she knew she wanted.But then?Just a little over a year later, right after shed taken the bar exam, shed learned that he was engaged.Shed spent the next six weeks in a funk, trying to figure out why the other girl had been good enough to marry while he hadnt even been able to discuss the subject with her.Where had she gone wrong?Had she been too pushy?Too boring?Or too something else?Looking back, she had no idea.Of course, the whole experience would have been easier if shed met someone else after Luis, but with every passing year she found herself wondering more and more where all the good guys had gone.Or even if there really was such a thing anymore.Where were the guys who didnt expect you to sleep with them after only a date or two?Or guys who believed that picking up the check on a first date was a classy thing to do?Or even a guy with a somewhat decent job and plans for the future?God knows, after she and Luis had broken up, shed put herself out there.Despite the long hours she spent studying in law school and then later, working in Charlotte, shed gone out regularly with friends on the weekends, but had anyone halfway decent asked her out?She momentarily broke off her paddling, allowing the board to glide as she straightened up, stretching her back.Well, actually, they probably had, she thought.But back then, shed tended to focus first on their appearance, and she could remember saying no to a few guys who hadnt been quite cute enough.And maybe that had been the problem.Maybe shed turned down Mr.Right because he hadnt been tall enough or whatever, and now  because he was Mr.Right  he was already off the market.These days, it seemed like Mr.Rights tended to fly off the shelves, perhaps because they were as rare as California condors.Most of the time, it didnt bother her.She was different from her mom, who believed that a womans relationship status defined her.She had her own life, she could come and go as she pleased, and while she didnt have anyone to take care of her, she didnt have to take care of anyone else, either.Yet in the past couple of years  as she began inching closer to thirty  there had been moments when she thought that it might be nice to have someone to go dancing with, or who would join her while she paddleboarded, or even someone willing to listen to her complain after a bad day at work.Having a wide circle of friends, like Serena did, might have filled that void, but most of Marias friends lived in either the Raleigh or Charlotte areas, and getting together with them almost always meant a road trip and sleeping on someones couch.Aside from her immediate family, relatives, Jill, and a few other coworkers  and, yes, even Paul, despite the other night  the only people she knew here were those shed gone to high school with, and because shed been away for years, theyd drifted apart.She supposed that she could try to reestablish contact, but by the time she finished up at work, all she usually wanted to do was unwind in the bathtub with a glass of wine and a good book.Or, if she felt energetic, maybe hit the water on the paddleboard.Even friendships took energy, and lately she didnt have enough to go around.While that meant her life wasnt all that exciting, it was also the kind of low key predictability she needed.Her last year in Charlotte had been traumatic, and  She shook her head, forcing away the memory of that final year.Taking a calming breath, she told herself firmly to focus on the positive, as shed trained herself to do.There were a lot of good things in her life.She had her family, her own place, and a job she enjoyed  Are you sure about that?, the little voice inside her suddenly asked.Because you know thats not quite true.It had started off well enough, but wasnt that always the case?Martenson, Hertzberg & Holdman was a midsize firm, and she worked principally for the primary litigator, Barney Holdman, doing insurance defense work.Barney was in his early sixties and a rainmaker for the firm, a legal genius who wore seersucker suits and spoke with a slow, heavy drawl straight from the mountains of North Carolina.To both clients and juries, he came across as the friendly grandfather type, but beneath the surface, he was hard driving, prepared for everything, and demanding of associates.In working for him, she had the privilege of time, expertise, and money to prepare her cases, all of which was a far cry from her work as a prosecutor.Jill was a bonus.As the only women in the office aside from secretaries and paralegals, who had their own cliques, Jill and Maria had hit it off right away, even though they worked in different departments.They had lunch together three or four times a week, and Jill often dropped by Marias office just to visit for a few minutes.She was quick witted and made Maria laugh, but had an incisive legal mind and was one of the firms key assets.Why she hadnt been made partner yet was a mystery.Maria sometimes wondered whether Jill was long for the firm, though shed said nothing directly about it.The real problem was Ken Martenson, the managing partner of the firm, who seemed to hire paralegals based on their attractiveness as opposed to their qualifications and spent too much time hovering around their desks.That part didnt necessarily bother Maria, nor did it bother her to see Ken fraternizing with one paralegal or another in a manner that sometimes seemed less than entirely professional.Jill had filled her in on Kens reputation during Marias first week on the job, especially his interest in attractive paralegals, but Maria had shrugged it off.That is, until Ken began to set his sights on her.It wasnt a good development, and lately the situation was getting even more complicated.It was one thing to try to avoid Ken at the office, where there were always other people around, but the conference in Winston Salem theyd attended last week had amplified her fears that things might get worse.Though Ken hadnt gone so far as to walk her to her hotel room door  thank God for small favors  he had pressured her into joining him for dinner both nights.And then?Hed given her the whole my wife just doesnt appreciate me spiel while continually asking whether she wanted another glass of wine, despite the fact that shed barely touched the first one.Hed talked about his place at the beach and how quiet and relaxing it was and noted more than once that it was usually empty.If she ever wanted to use it, all she had to do was ask.And had he mentioned how rare it was to work with someone who was both intelligent and beautiful?Could the man have been more obvious?Nevertheless, when hed hinted at what he wanted, shed played dumb and then steered the subject back to the issues discussed at the conference.And it had worked, for the most part, but she hadnt been lying to Serena when shed said it was complicated.Sometimes she wished that someone would have told her before she applied to law school that being an attorney wasnt quite the job guarantee shed always imagined it would be.In the past few years, firms of all sizes had been cutting back, salaries were dropping, and right now there were too many lawyers chasing too few positions.After shed left the district attorneys office, it had taken her nearly five months to land this job, and as far as she knew, none of the other firms in town were hiring.If she even mumbled the words sexual harassment or vaguely hinted about filing a lawsuit, she probably wouldnt be able to find another job in the entire state.Lawyers hated no one more than other lawyers who might sue them.For the time being, she was stuck.Shed made it through the conference but vowed not to put herself in that kind of situation again.Shed avoid the break room and be a bit more cautious about working late, especially when she knew Ken would be there.For now, that was all she could do, aside from pray that he turned his sights back on one of the paralegals.It was yet another example of the ways in which life had turned out to be more difficult than shed imagined it would.When shed started her first real job, shed been idealistic; life had seemed more like an adventure.Shed fully believed that she had a meaningful role to play in keeping the streets safe and in giving victims a way to seek justice and redress.But over time, shed begun to grow jaded about the entire process.It had become evident that even dangerous criminals often went free, the clogged wheels of the system turned impossibly slowly, and her caseload was never ending.Now she was living again in the city where shed grown up and practicing a kind of law vastly different from what shed known as an assistant DA.While shed been certain that things would be better once she was settled in, shed slowly come to realize that job stress simply came in different flavors, and this one wasnt much better tasting than the one before it.Shed been surprised by that, but then, shed been surprised by almost everything in the last seven years.The world might view her as a young, home owning professional, but there were moments when she felt like she was faking the whole thing.Part of it was financial  after paying her bills at the end of the month, she had less spending money than shed had as a teenager  but the other part was that most of her friends from college were already married, and some of them already had kids.When she talked to them, most came across as completely content, as though their lives were unfolding exactly as theyd planned, while she, on the other hand, had a sex crazed boss, a condo she could barely afford, and a younger sister who seemed simultaneously wiser and more carefree than Maria was.If this was adulthood, she wondered now why shed been in such a rush to grow up in the first place.For the next hour, she pulled steadily at the paddle, the board gliding forward as she did her best to enjoy her surroundings.She noted the slowly shifting clouds and the trees reflected in the water.She concentrated on the salty fresh scent of the breeze and basked in the warmth of the sun on her arms and shoulders.Every now and then she snapped a photograph, including a good one of an osprey clasping a fish in its talons as it rose from the water.It was too shadowed in the viewfinder and a little too distant, but with enough work in Photoshop, it might be something worth keeping.When she finally returned home, she showered and poured herself a glass of wine, then sat in a rocking chair shed placed in the small confines of her rear porch.She watched people as they walked along Market Street, idly wondering what their lives were like.She liked to invent stories about them That ones probably visiting from New York, or Ill bet that mom is taking her kids out for ice cream.It was a harmless, relaxing capstone to a weekend that had its share of both highs and lows.Like the blown tire.Which reminded her that shed have to run out tomorrow to get it replaced.But when?She knew that while shed been out of the office at the conference, Barney had filled her inbox with work.They also had two important meetings in the afternoon, which wasnt going to make it easy.Nor did she have any idea what Kens next move would be.The sense of dread intensified the following morning, when she spotted Ken speaking with Barney in his office while she chatted with Lynn, the voluptuous, though less than efficient, paralegal assigned to Barneys team.Ken and Barney often met before the Monday morning meeting, but what was unusual was that after Ken left Barneys office, hed simply nodded at her without smiling before striding down the hallway.Part of her was relieved by the brevity of the encounter, but at the same time, the sudden frosty professionalism left a bad feeling in her stomach, because it no doubt meant he was angry at her.A few minutes later, Jill poked her head in to apologize for the blind date, clearly mortified.They talked for a few minutes  Jill was heading out of town for the rest of the week for depositions  and Maria repeated to Jill the story shed told Serena about her flat tire and the stranger who had rescued her, which only made Jill feel even worse.As soon as Jill left, Maria started calling garages, trying to find someplace close where she could get her tire changed after work, but soon discovered that all of them would be closed by the time she arrived.Her only option was to try to get it done over her lunch hour.It took six attempts before she was finally able to snag an appointment at half past noon  cutting it close for the initial client meeting at one thirty.She warned Barney that she might be a few minutes late getting back.He frowned but told her to do her best, emphasizing that her presence was important.She left the office at a quarter to twelve, hoping that the mechanics would be able to start early.But they didnt start early.Nor did they even start on time.In the end, she spent the next hour waiting, alternating between panic and slowly mounting fury, making calls to Barneys secretary and the paralegal, as well as to Barneys cell phone.It wasnt until after two that she was finally able to reclaim her car and speed back to the office.By the time she reached the conference room, the meeting had been in progress for nearly forty five minutes.An icy stare from Barney signaled his displeasure, belying his slow, easy drawl as he welcomed her into the conference room.After the meeting, she apologized profusely to Barney.He was clearly irate; gone was any trace of the friendly grandfather that clients were accustomed to.Things remained tense between them for the rest of the afternoon.It was no better the following day, and pouring herself into the various tasks at hand, Maria caught up on the matters shed ignored while at the conference, in addition to preparing the documents she knew Barney needed for a trial the following week.She labored past midnight on both Monday and Tuesday, and with Jill out of the office, she worked through her lunch hours all week, eating takeout at her desk while toiling on various briefs.Barney apparently didnt notice or care, and it wasnt until Thursday that his icy demeanor began to thaw.Later that afternoon, however  as she was finishing up a conversation with Barney in his office concerning an insurance claim that they both strongly suspected was fraudulent  she heard a voice behind her.Looking up, she saw Ken standing in the doorway.Excuse me, he said, addressing them both but mainly focusing on Barney.Would you mind if I spoke to Maria for a moment?Not at all, Barney drawled.He nodded at Maria.Give them a ring and let them know that well need to set a conference call for tomorrow.Absolutely.Ill let you know what they say, Maria responded.She could feel Ken staring at her, could feel the tightness in her chest as she turned to face him.By then, Ken had already turned to leave, and without a word, she followed him down the hallway and through the reception area.Her feet dragged when she realized he was heading toward his office.As they approached, his secretary averted her gaze.Ken held the door open for her, then closed it behind him.All business now, he moved behind his desk and gestured for her to sit in the chair opposite.He gazed out the window before finally turning to face her.Barney mentioned to me that you missed an important client meeting on Monday.I didnt miss it.I was late   I didnt call you here to quibble over the details, he said, cutting her off.Would you care to explain what happened?Caught off guard, Maria stammered out an admittedly pathetic account of her attempts to find a suitable garage and the events that had followed.When she was finished, he said nothing for a moment.You do understand what we do here, right?And why you were hired?Our clients expect a certain level of professionalism.Yes, of course I do.And I know our clients are important.Did you know that Barney was thinking of allowing you the opportunity to act as lead counsel on this matter?And that you took this opportunity off the table because you felt the suddenly urgent, desperate need to change your tire during business hours?Maria flushed, her thoughts spinning at this new revelation.No, he didnt mention that, she sputtered.And like I said, I wanted to get it done after work, but every place would have already been closed.I honestly thought I could get back in time.I knew there was a risk, but   A risk you were clearly more than willing to take, he observed, again cutting her off.She opened her mouth to respond, but by then, she knew already that there was nothing she could say to appease him.In the silence, Maria felt a knot form in her stomach as Ken finally took a seat at his desk.I must say that Im very disappointed in your decision, he said, sounding in control.We took the risk of hiring you because I, among others, went to bat for you.Your work at the DAs office was hardly relevant to our practice here, as you know.But I thought you had potential.Now, Im not sure what to think or whether I made the wrong decision.Im really sorry.It wont happen again.I hope not.For your sake, not mine.The knot in her stomach grew even larger.What can I do to make things right?For now, nothing.Ill talk to Barney and find out what he thinks and then well let you know what we decide.Should I call the clients?Perhaps try to apologize?I think you should do nothing for now.I said that Barney and I will discuss it.But if something like this ever happens again He leaned forward, turning on his desk lamp.It wont, she whispered, still trying to get her bearings.Barney was thinking about making her lead counsel?Why hadnt he mentioned that to her?In that instant, the phone on the desk rang and Ken picked it up.After announcing his name, he nodded before covering the mouthpiece.Ive got to take this call.Well finish our talk at another time.The way he said it left no doubt that theyd talk again and Maria rose from her seat, humiliated and panicked.Her thoughts in disarray, she stumbled out of Kens office.Passing his secretary, she was grateful that the woman ignored her.When she reached her office, she shut the door and ran through the conversation again.Despite herself, she wondered just how long she would be able to continue working there.Or whether shed even be given a choice.CHAPTER 3      Colin      O  n the Monday after his fight, Colin stepped out of his apartment and was ambling toward the old Camaro when he suddenly spotted Detective Pete Margolis.The cop had parked in the street out front and was leaning against the hood of his sedan, holding a to go cup of coffee, a toothpick in his mouth.Unlike most of the officers Colin had dealt with in the past, Margolis spent almost as much time in the gym as Colin did.His sleeves were rolled up, the fabric straining against his biceps.He was in his late thirties, his dark hair swept back and greased in place with God knows what.Once, sometimes twice a month, he would show up unannounced to check on Colin as part of Colins court ordered deal.Margolis clearly enjoyed the power he had over his charge.You look like hell, Hancock, he said as Colin drew near.You do anything I should know about?No, Colin answered.You sure about that?Colin watched Margolis instead of answering.He knew the guy would eventually get around to whatever he wanted to say.Margolis moved his toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other.There was a brawl in the parking lot at Crazy Horse a little after midnight.A bunch of guys swinging bottles at each other; a few cars in the lot got dented up and there was a man knocked unconscious.Witnesses said hed been kicked in the head after he was on the ground.Right now, hes in the hospital with a cracked skull.Thats assault with a deadly weapon, you know, and as soon as I heard about it, I thought to myself how familiar that sounded.Didnt I arrest you for something like that right here in Wilmington?Just a few years ago?And havent you been in a couple of scrapes since then?Margolis already knew the answers, but Colin answered anyway.Yes to the first.No to the second.Oh, thats right.Because your friends intervened.The goofy guy and the hot blond chick, right?Colin said nothing.Margolis stared.Colin continued to wait until Margolis finally went on.Thats why Im here, by the way.Okay.Just okay?Colin said nothing.He had learned to say as little as possible in the presence of the police.Put yourself in my shoes, Margolis finally went on.The thing is, pretty much everyone scattered as soon as the sirens started closing in.A couple of witnesses stuck around and I talked to them, but I figured I was just wasting my time.Its a lot easier to go straight to the source, dont you think?Colin hitched his backpack a little higher on his shoulder.Are we done here?Not quite.I dont think you understand whats going on.I understand.But none of this concerns me.I wasnt there.Can you prove that?Can you prove otherwise?Margolis took a sip of his coffee, then fished a fresh toothpick from his pocket.He took his time placing it in his mouth.That almost sounds like youre trying to hide something.It was just a question, Colin said.All right, then.Lets get to the questions.Where were you Saturday night?In Jacksonville.Oh yeah, he said.The fight.MMA stuff, right?You told me about that.Did you win?Margolis didnt care and Colin knew it.He watched Margolis take another sip of coffee.The point is, we were able to get a couple of descriptions from the witnesses, and it turns out that the guy who did the kicking was in his midtwenties, muscular with tattoos on his arms and short brown hair, almost a buzz cut.And wouldnt you know it, it turns out that the guy was pretty bruised up even before the fight started.People had seen him inside.And because I knew youd just been fighting in Jacksonville well, it doesnt take a genius to figure out what happened.Colin wondered how much, if any, of Margoliss story was true.Do you have any other questions for me?Margolis shifted the toothpick again while setting his coffee on the hood.Were you at the Crazy Horse on Saturday night?No.You didnt even stop by?For a few minutes?No.And if I have a witness that says he saw you there?Then hes lying.But youre not.Again, Colin didnt answer.There was no reason to.And part of him suspected that even Margolis knew it, because after a long moment, he crossed his arms, his muscles flexing almost  but not entirely  involuntarily.If the detective really had something, Colin knew he would have already been arrested.All right, Margolis said.Then answer this: Where were you between midnight and one a. m.  on Sunday?Colin sorted through his memory.I wasnt watching the clock.But I was either about to leave Treys Diner on Highway 17, or driving home, or changing some ladys tire during the storm.I was home right around one thirty.Treys Diner?Why the hell would you eat there?I was hungry.What time did you leave Jacksonville?It was after midnight.Maybe five or ten minutes after, but I dont know for sure.Witnesses?Dozens.And I assume you ate alone at Treys?I was with my landlord.Margolis snorted.Evan?One half of the dynamic duo?Thats convenient.Colin flexed his jaw, ignoring the barb.Im sure the waitress will remember the two of us.Because you look like you had your face run through a meat grinder?No.Because Evan stood out in a place like that.Margolis smirked, but business was business.So you left the diner.Yes.Alone?Yes.Evan left a few minutes before I did.He drove his own car.So theres no one who can say where you went afterwards?I already told you what happened after that.Oh, thats right.You changed a ladys tire.Yes.In the storm?Yes.Did you know her?No.Then why did you stop?Because I thought she might need my help.Margolis considered Colins answer, no doubt thinking that Colin had been caught in a mistake.How could you know she might need help unless youd already stopped?I saw she needed a hand getting the tire out.I stopped and got out of the car.I offered to help.She said no at first.She asked if she could borrow my phone and call her sister.I let her use my phone and she called her sister.And then she asked for my help in changing her tire.I changed it.Then I got in my car and drove straight home.What time was this?I dont know.But a call was made from my phone from the woman to her sister.If youd like, Ill show you my call log.By all means.Colin reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone; a few taps and the call log was on display, confirming his alibi.He showed it to Margolis.Margolis took out his pad and made a point to slowly jot the number down.No doubt it was right around the time of the brawl, because his biceps flexed again.How do I know thats the number for the ladys sister?You dont.But youre fine if I call and check.Do what you want.Its your time that youll be wasting.Margoliss eyes narrowed slightly.You think youre pretty smart, dont you?No.Oh yeah you do.But you know what?Youre not.Colin didnt answer, and for a long moment, they continued to stare at each other.Margolis grabbed his coffee again and circled back to the drivers side door.Im going to check this out, you know.Because you and I both know that you dont belong on the streets.A guy like you?How many people have you sent to the hospital over the years?Youre violent, and while you think you can control it forever, you cant.And when that happens, Im going to be there.And Ill be the first one to say, I told you so.A moment later, the sedan was pulling away, Colin watching until it finally vanished around the corner.What was that about?Colin turned around and spotted Evan on the porch.Already dressed for work, his friend stepped down and started up the walk.The usual.
