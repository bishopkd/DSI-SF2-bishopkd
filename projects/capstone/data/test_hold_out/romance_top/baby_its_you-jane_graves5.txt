No.It was a big deal.Believe me.A really big deal.A pair of shoes, a heating pad, a couple of Band Aids  No.You dont understand.Nobodys ever done stuff like this for me before.The words were out of her mouth before she really thought about them.Now she was stuck feeling just a little bit pitiful, particularly when a look of disbelief came over Marcs face.Ever?Yeah.Ever.But when you were a kid, surely  When my mother was alive, I guess.How old were you when she died?Eight.After that, my fathers staff was nice to me.But it wasnt the same.She shrugged.You can pay people to do all kinds of things.Doesnt mean they care.Marc just stared at her as if her words didnt compute, and suddenly she wished shed kept her mouth shut.Shed looked pitiful enough when shed almost quit her job.The last thing she wanted to do was look even more pathetic now.What made you change your mind about the job?Marc asked.I dont know.It doesnt matter.Thanks again for helping me, she said, having a hard time looking at him.She nodded toward the door.Go ahead.Ill close it behind you.But he didnt move.Instead, he continued to stare at her.It was just like at Animal House that night, when he hadnt even blinked.He just stared at her stoically, as if he was feeling absolutely nothing.Zero.Nada.Zilch.So why wasnt he leaving?He flicked his gaze to her almost empty wineglass.Now that I think about it, he said, they say people who drink alone have a drinking problem.Youre new in town.We wouldnt want people jumping to the wrong conclusion.Karis heart bumped hard against her chest, her stomach quivering with anticipation.Exactly.Its like you said when we were at the inn.This is a small town.Word gets around.But he made no move to grab another wineglass and fill it.She held her breath, wondering what he was thinking.His gaze played across her face, then moved downward to her chest, then lower to the V of her robe where it dipped down between her breasts.It had fallen open slightly when she rose from the sofa, but the last thing she wanted to do right then was pull it shut.As far as she was concerned, he could look at anything he wanted to as long as he wanted to.They both stood motionless, the air between them growing hot and heavy.Evening was turning to dusk, and the dim light from the single lamp gave the room a dreamy, otherworldly feeling.Or maybe it was the wine.Maybe she didnt know.She only knew she loved the feeling and didnt want to lose it.Then his attention turned to a spot above her eyes, and his brows drew together with concern.Whats the matter?she asked.Is that a bruise on your forehead?Yeah.What happened?I came out the kitchen door.Unfortunately, it was the door youre supposed to use to come in.Ive learned thats a felony when youre working in a restaurant.He lifted the hair on her forehead to examine it more closely.Its okay, she said.It doesnt hurt.If Id known about it, Id have brought an ice pack.No need.Im fine.He moved his fingertips downward, letting her hair fall back against her forehead.But to her surprise, instead of pulling his hand away, he traced those two fingertips all the way along her cheek to her jaw, then wrapped his callused hand around the side of her neck and stepped closer.Oh, my God.She couldnt meet his eyes.Didnt dare.She just stared straight ahead at that big, rock hard chest and prayed he didnt stop.She leaned into him, closing her eyes at the heavenly feeling of her body pressed against all that bone and muscle.All the sexy thoughts shed been having about him since she came to his door two nights ago melted into a red hot jumble in her mind until thinking wasnt an option.She couldnt have mustered up a single coherent thought if her life depended on it.Whatever pain shed felt earlier had vanished.She only knew she wanted Marc.She wanted him here.And she wanted him now.This is a bad idea, he whispered.Kari felt a shot of desperation.No.Its a good idea.An excellent idea.In fact, its the best idea Ive come across all day.He moved his other hand around to the small of her back to pull her closer, and her heart went crazy.But he still did nothing else.Good God.Did he have to have so damned much self control?Whats wrong?she said, barely able to breathe for the anticipation she felt.Do you have a girlfriend I dont know about?No.No girlfriend.And I no longer have a fianc.But you just left him at the altar two days ago.Which was better than marrying the wrong man.Okay, thats logical, he said.And then he kissed her.8    Logical?Marc couldnt believe hed said that.There was nothing logical about thisnot one damned thingwhich was probably why he couldnt keep his hands off Kari.If hed been following logic, hed have been out the door already.That was where hed intended to be.Out the door.But then shed mentioned how nobody had ever done nice things for her, and then hed seen that bruise on her forehead and realized what a tough day shed just had, and now  And now he was kissing her and loving every minute of it.She returned his kiss with a fierceness that astonished him.He loved the way she tastedsweet and hot and silky smootheverything hed imagined she would be.It was as if hed fallen into an alternate universe, one where a beautiful woman had appeared in front of him and all the restrictions hed put on his love life for the past eighteen years had been blasted away.Then her hands were on his shirt buttons, flicking them open with the enthusiasm of a prospector whod spotted gold and was going after it.If hed been in his right mind he might have called a halt to this.But not only had he lost his train of thought, it had veered off the track and plunged over a cliff.Its just you, this woman, and nobody else.What do you need?An engraved invitation?Go for it!He ripped off his shirt and tossed it aside, then went for her robe.He loosened the tie and pushed it off her shoulders, and she gave a little shimmy and it dropped to the floor behind her.He saw what she had on underneath it and froze.Leopard print panties.And that was all.Holy shit.He felt like some kind of Pavlovs dog where this womans panties were concerned.What could she possibly wear that didnt turn him on?His gaze rose to her breasts.It was just as hed suspected.They were the Eighth Wonder of the World, clearly the ones God gave her, so he felt justified in deciding they were just about perfect.He spread his hands wide over them and rubbed them in circles, squeezing, releasing, kissing her deeply at the same time.Just touching her made his jeans grow tighter by the second.He shifted, trying to take away the exquisite pain, but only one thing was going to cure that problem.He couldnt remember ever wanting a woman this much.He was dying to make love to her, willing to walk through fire for it.He pulled away and sat down on the sofa to yank off his boots.When he stood again, she pressed her hands against his chest and dragged them down to his belt buckle.In no time she had his belt off and then he was kicking both his jeans and underwear aside.She fell back on the sofa, and he stopped for a hard breathing moment to stare down at her.My God, he whispered.Dont stop now.He sprang into action again, sliding those leopard panties down her hot, silky thighs.He pulled them all the way off and tossed them aside.Damn, he muttered.Sofa bed.Gotta pull it out.Forget that, she said.Dont need it.Right here.Just like this.Her eyes were alight with excitement, those green eyes that had messed up his mind in ways hed never felt before.All he wanted to do was fall on top of her, slide inside, and make love to her until his nerves exploded.Then he remembered.Condom.Christ, he didnt have a condom!What the hell was he supposed to do now?Think.Think!Okay.Daniel stayed at the cottage whenever he was in town.And he never hesitated to entertain women.Lots of women.And that meant he needed lots of condoms.Marc only hoped hed left a few behind.Wait, he told Kari, pointing at her.Dont move.Do not move!He jerked open the dresser drawer and plowed through it.He shoved pens, notepads, paper clips, and other assorted junk aside.Come on, Daniel.Dont let me down now!Then he saw it.A whole freaking box of condoms.He opened the box and snagged one of the plastic packets.It was the most beautiful thing hed ever seen.Would she think it was weird if he kissed it?He ripped it open.Rolled it on.Then he turned, fell between her legs, and slid inside her, groaning out loud with the sheer pleasure of it.She was so hot and tight that he damned near came on the spot.He wanted to go slow.Knew he should.But it had been too long.Too damned long, and now he couldnt get enough.He had to move hard and fast.Had to.His brain was telling him to go slow, but his body was telling him to hit the gas.His body was winning.Karis fingertips dug into his back, and no matter how hard he thrust, she lifted her hips to meet him, urging him on, and that shoved him even closer to the brink.Her breath was fiery hot against his neck, coming faster and faster with every stroke.Then she gasped, a single sharp intake of air.Then the gasp became a groan of pleasure.Her thighs tightened around him.She whispered his name between hot, heavy breaths.He whispered hers.And then he was coming.He plunged deep inside her, gritting his teeth against the indescribable sensations.Oh, Godthis was it.What hed wanted for so long, what hed lain awake nights thinking about.Maybe any woman would have made him feel this way.Or maybe she had to have wild auburn hair.Electric green eyes.Breasts to die for.Long, tanned legs he could slide his hands up until they reached the promised land.He lifted himself away from her, then sat down on the end of the sofa, his breath still labored, his body still a boneless mass of pure ecstasy.Kari sat up next to him, leaning in to kiss his neck.Hang around for a while, she whispered.You never know what might pop up again later.That sounded damned good to him.If there was more of this in store for him, hed move in permanently, and the two of them could have sex for the rest of eternity.Then all at once he had a terrible thought.He froze, turning it over in his mind, trying to dismiss it, but he couldnt.It had been a long time since Daniel had stayed in the cottage.Too long?He grabbed the condom box.Blinked to focus.And there it was.The date.He groaned out loud.The condoms were expired?Whats the matter?Kari asked.He had condoms in his bedroom back at the house.Nonexpired ones, because he was a man who was always prepared even though the chances of him needing them were nil.Why hadnt he taken Kari up there?If he was going to do this, why hadnt he done it right?He tossed the condoms back into the drawer, went to the bathroom to clean up, then came back to the living room.Marc?Kari said.Whats the matter?I was right before, he said.This was a bad idea.Kari blinked.Huh?I have to go.Go?Why?He yanked his jeans on.Then his boots.Marc, tell me whats wrong.The condoms, he said finally.What about them?Theyre expired.Uhokayjust how expired are they?Two months.She let out a breath of relief.Just two months?Thats okay.Those things are good for years.The manufacturers wouldnt have cut it that close.Its not like the clock hits midnight on the expiration date and suddenly theyre worthless.We dont know that.He headed for the door, putting his shirt on as he went.Marc, wait.Kari scrambled off the sofa and caught up with him.Youre overreacting.Overreacting?He had news for her.When it came to defective condoms, there was no such thing as overreacting.But he didnt want to go into it.He didnt want to talk about his pregnant teenage girlfriend who had their baby and then deserted them.About the crushing responsibility of a newborn baby.About the feeling of claustrophobia that had crept up on him in the past few years until it threatened to smother him.About how hed seen that expiration date on those condoms and it had brought it all back to him, making him wonder if he wasnt repeating the mistakes of his past like a horny teenage kid without a lick of common sense.He opened the door and left the cottage without looking back.He knew if he didnt, hed be sunk.It wasnt fair to walk out on Kari like this without another word.In fact, he was being the jerk of the century for doing it.But nothingabsolutely nothingwas going to keep him in this town now that he finally had the opportunity to leave.Kari could stay in his cottage until they were both old and gray, but what had just happened between them was never going to happen again.A few days later, Kari was leaning against the wall in the kitchen at Rosies for five breath catching seconds when Gloria came through the door.Bad morning?she asked.No.Im okay.Youre such a liar, Gloria said with a smile.But dont worry.Itll get easier.But so far, that hadnt been true.It wasnt getting easier.The morning rush had been unholy.Marla had triple seated her because people hated to wait at the front of the restaurant when they could see empty tables.Sit them down and bring them coffee, Rosie said, but even that was a challenge for Kari to do in a decent amount of time, much less take their orders.She wore Angelas old sneakers, which helped, but even two pairs of socks and Band Aids didnt keep her blisters from hurting.Bobbie took one look at the shoes, made a face, and asked her if shed been cleaning out horse stalls.And Marc.She couldnt stop thinking about Marc.Shed had rugs pulled out from under her a time or two, but this time shed been dumped squarely on her ass, and it had hurt ten times worse than her back pain and blisters.Ever since hed walked out the door a few nights ago, the only time she saw him was at dusk every evening when he sat out on his deck with Brandy, drinking a glass of wine and staring at the setting sun.She understood the expired condom thing, even though she didnt think it was as big a deal as Marc did.What were the odds of that being a problem?Come on, Kari, Rosie said.Get moving.The place is packed.Kari sighed and pushed away from the wall, telling herself she had to concentrate on her job.She knew part of the equation that added up to success was smiling at everybody all the time.She tried that.She really tried.Shed go to a table and look all happy, but the moment she returned to the kitchen and realized she hadnt written down what kind of dressing somebody wanted on their salad, shed worry that maybe there was something else shed forgotten, and she could feel that smile wilting like a daisy in the desert.She watched Bobbie flirt with a couple of guys in a booth by the window.If she leaned over any farther to take their order, her breasts were going to fall right out of her shirt and tumble onto the table.Kari had never been particularly good at flirting.It always came off sounding stilted and stupid, so if she had to practically disrobe to make a few tips, she was screwed.As the morning rush edged into the lunch rush, Kari ran to the kitchen to pick up two orders of chicken fried steak.Bobbie was standing beside the warming lights, her fists on her hips, shouting at one of Rosies newer cooks who had started working there only a few days before Kari had, a fifty something Mexican man who just stared back at Bobbie blankly.Come on, Carlos!she said.ndale!ndale!But Carlos was acting as if his hands weighed three thousand pounds each.Finally he put the sandwich under the warming lights.Thats wheat bread!Bobbie said.The order was for white!Will you get it right?When Carlos gave her a helpless shrug, Bobbie narrowed her eyes.You understand every bit of what Im saying.No hablo ingls.Wrong.Rosie wouldnt have hired you if you couldnt speak halfway decent English.You hablo all the ingls you feel like habloing!Carlos gave her a wide eyed look and another shrug.Blanco bread!Bobbie said.Blanco!And youd better have it ready the next time I come in here!Bobbie headed for the cooler to grab a couple of premade house salads.Carlos frowned at her, then turned to Kari and gave her a smile and a wink.He dipped his ladle into a big pot on the stove.Extra gravy, Carlos said, plopping an extra huge serving onto the top of the chicken fried steaks.Your customersthey like.Carlos put the plates on the warming ledge.Gracias, Kari said as she grabbed them, giving Carlos a grateful smile at the same time.It wasnt the first time hed given her customers a little extra, and she really appreciated it.In fact, all the other people there tried to help her every way they could, even though sometimes it seemed like a lost cause.Everybody except Bobbie.Bobbie knew Carlos liked Kari and didnt like her.All the cooks in the kitchen felt the same, mostly because Kari was polite to them rather than demanding.But since most of them were half scared of Bobbie, they didnt generally cross her.Kari started toward the kitchen door, chicken fried steaks in hand, telling herself she was okay.She could do this.She could fill her brain with all kinds of things and still remember all of it and in the right order.All it took was a little practice.Then Bobbie stuck her head back into the kitchen.Table six wants you.Kari stopped short, slumping with frustration.What for?Theyre asking about their food.And theyve decided they need a high chair for the kid after all.And crackers.And extra napkins.And more water.Kari closed her eyes with frustration.Bobbie sighed, and for maybe the first time, a look of sympathy came over her face.Which table are those chicken fried steaks going to?Nine, Kari said.Why?She held out her hands.Give them to me.Kari narrowed her eyes suspiciously.Why?Will you just give them to me?Ill deliver them, and you take care of table six.Kari didnt like this.Not one little bit.Hey, Im offering to help you, Bobbie said.Itd be pretty ungrateful if you didnt take me up on it.Kari still didnt like it, but she was in a bind.Finally she handed her the plates.Now, get out there, Bobbie said.Or you can kiss your tip good bye.Kari left the kitchen, swinging by to grab a high chair, only to go to table six and be told theyd never asked for one.Then she heard the crash.She set the high chair down and hurried back to the kitchen.Bobbie stood over two broken plates on the floor, their shards mingling with lumps of chicken fried steak and gravy.She put her hands to her face.Oh, my!Im sorry, Kari.I cant believe I was so clumsy.They slipped right out of my hands.Kari looked down in horror.No, no, no!This meant the order had to be put in again, and it was going to be ages before those people got their food.And her tip would go right out the window.As she stood there staring at the carnage, Bobbie said, I have an idea.Why dont you ask your friend Carlos to fix you two new chicken fried steaks?Oh, wait.Silly me.He doesnt hablo ingls.As she flounced out of the kitchen, Kari wanted to cry.Just start boohooing at the top of her lungs.But then she pictured herself crawling back to her father and asking for her money back.Hed give it to her.She knew he would.The question was, what would she have to do to make that happen?And Marc.No matter how frustrated she was with him right then, his words of encouragement still rang inside her head.Trust me.Youre tougher than you think you are.And that meant she had to keep going.She put in an order for two more chicken fried steaks, and Carlos said hed move them to the front of the queue.Then she went back out to the dining room to deal with demanding customers and her own aching feet.That afternoon, Marc walked the sloping landscape of the vineyard, where row after row of grapes hung heavily on their vines.The green of their ragged leaves was edging into gold, signaling the last few weeks of ripening.This morning hed felt a breath of cool air in spite of the heat, like a gentle tap on his shoulder, a whisper in his ear: Autumn is coming.Then harvest.Pay attention.Read the signs.Be ready.He could almost feel life bursting from the grape clusters as they ripened on the vine, tiny globes of potential energy that would become a kinetic explosion at harvest.He stopped beside Ramon, who was examining one of the vines and the clusters of grapes it held.His face was deeply tanned and fissured, a product of long summers working in the Texas sun.His hands were growing gnarled, with enlarged joints that were the first indication of the arthritis he tried so hard to hide.It wouldnt be long before pruning vines and picking grapes would be out of the question for him, but Marc knew hed crawl out to the vines before he finally admitted he couldnt do it any longer.Looking good, Ramon said.But I did see half a dozen wasps this morning.Marcs heart skipped with apprehension.Any nests?One.This wasnt good.Wasps were generally almost nonexistent through most of the growing season, but when the sugar content increased in the last days of ripening, the pests could descend on a vineyard and destroy the fruit.Set the traps and keep watch for damaged fruit.If you see it, get it out of the field.And be on the lookout for more nests.And pray we dont get another hard rain in the next few weeks.I think were in the clear from this last one, Ramon said.Theres still plenty of time for the grapes to settle and the sugar to stabilize.Soon that magical moment would come when the acidity decreased, the sugar content rose, and a perfect equilibrium was reached.Then it was time for harvest.Determining that moment began with lab tests, but it ended with much more objective things.Taste, weather conditions, plus something that couldnt be quantifiedthe intuition of an experienced vintner.Marcs grandfather had begun this vineyard in 1948, and his father had grown it to the size and quality it was today.The outbreak of Pierces disease in 1996 had damned near wiped them out, but theyd come back, planting new vines and rejuvenating the ones theyd been able to salvage.Marc remembered his father taking him out into the vineyard when he was a boy, showing him the vines, pointing out mold or pests and telling him what to do about them.As the grapes ripened, he demonstrated how they should look and feel and taste.Then came harvest, which was some of the hardest, dirtiest work a man could possibly do.But the harvest party made it all worth it, when they opened a bottle from a prior years vintage and his father toasted their success.Those times were written across Marcs memory in indelible ink, memories that would stay with him for the rest of his life.His father had tried to instill those same feelings for the family business in Daniel, but he was always immersed in computers and video games and anything else that didnt involve the day to day operations.Working in the vineyard was Daniels definition of hell on earth.It looks as if well be harvesting a little sooner than last year, Marc said.Theyre moving fast.When will Daniel be here?He said sometime next week, but with Daniel you can never be too sure.Ramon just nodded.I know how you feel about him running the place.Ramon held up his palm.None of my business.No, it is your business.Youve been part of this vineyard for the past twenty years.You know your opinion is important to me.Daniel Ramon shook his head.Im just not sure about him.Thats all.He knows what it takes.He grew up at this vineyard.You know its nothing personal.I couldnt love him more if he was my own kid.But hes just not cut out for this.Not like you are.It didnt matter whether Daniel was cut out for it or not.Three years.That was their deal.He could certainly keep the place going that long, particularly if Ramon was there with his steadying hand.But Daniel was also impulsive.Prone to coming up with ideas he was dying to implement whether they made sense or not.More distractible than a kitten whod spied a string.Focused on cars and women and the next big deal.But they had a bargain, and Marc intended to hold him to it.I have to get out of here for a while, Marc said.Just for a few years.Ill be back.So youre keeping the vineyard after that?For a long time, Marc didnt respond.Couldnt respond.He didnt know what the next three years would bring.What would he see out there in the world that was more enticing than running a vineyard for the rest of his life?He, Nina, and Daniel would all have a say in the decision, but when it got right down to it, the vineyard was Marcs to keep.Or his to sell.Im not sure what Ill be doing with it, he said.But itll be a few years before we make a decision.A lot can happen in a few years.Marc knew just how true that was.A poorly timed harvest.A too cold summer.Birds and bugs and rabbits and mold.Any one of those things could turn a potential banner year into a subpar vintage that would screw up the reputation Marc had tried so hard to maintain.What happens happens, Marc said.I wonder what your dad might say about that, Ramon said.Marc turned away, hating the sound of those words.Ramon sighed.Im sorry.That was out of line.No.Its okay.Its not as if I havent done a little thinking about that myself.He looked at Ramon.Youll stay, wont you?Ive been here a long time.Seen this place through the good times and the bad.I cant imagine being anywhere else.He paused.I cant imagine you being anywhere else.Sometimes Marc couldnt, either.But he knew that was only because hed never lived anywhere else.The moment he got the chance to see what was out there for him, Rainbow Valley wouldnt seem so important anymore.It was the perfect time to leave.Curtis had been gone almost a year now.Nina was getting over the shock of his death, and she had plenty of money from the settlement the company had provided after the accident to live comfortably even if she didnt work.Angela intended to become a veterinarian, and since there was room in Rainbow Valley for only one vet and that post was occupied, shed probably never live there again.And Daniel had enough money to last him for the rest of his life, so taking three years out to run the vineyard wasnt interfering with his livelihood.But until then  Marc thought about Kari, her stunning green eyes, her beautiful breasts, her gorgeous naked body lying on that sofa.It had been as if dormant cells inside him had suddenly come to life, making him want her with an intensity that bordered on insanity.Being with her was like getting a head start on the life hed envisioned all these years, a chance to get a little crazy, have a little fun.What could possibly be wrong with that?Maybe she was right.Maybe he had overreacted.Manufacturers didnt cut it that close on the quality of their products versus expiration dates.He needed to ease up.Relax.Take precautions, of course, but let logic and reason rule.In spite of everything, he needed to stop worrying about it.He was a logical man, and it just wasnt logical to get uptight about those kinds of odds.He wanted her again, no matter how out of bounds it seemed for the man hed been all these years.But after the way hed acted, what were the chances that shed want him?9    When the waitresses at Rosies got to the end of their shift that afternoon, Bobbie did what she always did.She asked the rest of them how their day had gone, then proceeded to tell them how much shed made in tips.Most of the time she blew everybody else out of the water.But if somebody happened to make more than she did, there was always an excuse.Shed had six tables with nothing but women, and women were terrible tippers.The air conditioner was acting up, and the customers in her section complained about being hot.The cooks couldnt get a steak right to save their lives.But when she outperformed the rest of them, it was because she was next in line for induction to the Waitress Hall of Fame.For Kari, that day had gone pretty much like the past ones had.Shed made so little in the way of tips that if things didnt change, she was never going to be able to support herself.She was just about ready to take her meager earnings and call it quits for the day when Nina came through the door.Im meeting a friend, she said to Kari.Why dont you keep me company until she gets here?Kari sat down at a table across from Nina, relishing the chance to rest for the first time that day.So hows the job?Nina asked.Its okay.I mean, its a little hard because Ive never waited tables before.But Ill get the hang of it.Nina leaned in and spoke softly.So how are you getting along with Bobbie?Uh oh.In spite of what Marc had said about her, it made Kari nervous to say what she really thought.That could be dangerous in a small town like this.Oh.Just fine.Well, that must mean hell finally froze over, Nina said quietly.Bobbie Arnette doesnt get along with anybody.You wouldnt be telling me a fib now, would you?Kari sighed.Well, sometimes she is a little hard to deal with.There you go.Now, thats the Bobbie I know.I dont think she likes me.Bobbie doesnt like anybody.But I didnt do anything to her.All I did was show up.Oh, no, Nina said.You did way more than that.Kari was horrified.What?You had the nerve to be gorgeous.Bobbie doesnt like anyone prettier than she is.Shes pretty.Honey, she looks like a mud fence compared to you.So what do I do about it?Gain fifty pounds, chop off all that gorgeous red hair, and stop wearing deodorant.Is that all?No.Throw in a breast reduction, and you two can be best buddies.Kari sighed.She knew the job would be a challenge, but she hadnt expected any of the other waitresses to be.How are the tips?Nina asked.Not great.Hmm.Are you having fun with it?Kari was aghast.Fun?Waiting tables is hard work, but you cant let anyone see that.This is a tourist town.A lot of people come here on vacation, and they want to relax.If you look like youre always out of breath, that makes the whole situation tense.People dont like that.No tension?That was like asking a person being chased by a bear to pretend they were out for a Sunday stroll.Just try to have a good time, Nina said.People having fun always look like they know what theyre doing.Kari did like to find the fun in anything she did, but pasting on a big smile when she had to be on her feet for hours each day with half a dozen people wanting something from her all at once while she was sweating like mad and wearing ugly shoeswell, that was a real challenge.So how are things going at the vineyard?Nina asked.Is the cottage working out for you?Its great.And if Marc came back, it would be even better.I wasnt surprised to hear that Marc let you stay there.Yeah?I was.Nina laughed.Thats because you dont know Marc.Sometimes I want to shoot him dead for being so bossy.But he always does the right thing in the end.When the going gets tough, hes the guy you want in your corner.And dont you dare tell him I said that, or hell become so insufferable the rest of us will all pick up a gun.Kari told Nina about Marc showing up at her door with a boxful of things to help her feel better.That doesnt surprise me, either, Nina said.Remember, this is the man who acted as if it was such an imposition for you to stay there.How long has he been divorced?Kari asked.Nina looked surprised.Divorced?Uhyeah.I assumed  Marc was never married.What?Angelas mother was his high school girlfriend.She got pregnant, then ran off after Angela was born.Marc would have married her, but she didnt want anything to do with a baby or a husband.You mean he raised Angela alone?And he was only in high school?Yeah.And Daniel and I were just kids ourselves when Angela was born.I was fifteen, and Daniel was thirteen.Our father was dead, and our mother was in bad health.Shes gone now, too.Marc was already calling the shots at the vineyard by that time, even with going to school.Then he had a baby on top of everything?Yeah.But if theres anybody who can handle the hard stuff, its Marc.Kari was stunned.Shed assumed hed been divorced somewhat recently, but hed never been married at all?His high school girlfriend had gotten pregnant and then left him with a newborn baby?Then it struck her.Maybe that was why he took his condoms so seriously.Suddenly what had happened between them a few nights ago was making a lot more sense.Just then a woman came into the caf wearing jeans and a T shirt, a tote bag slung over her shoulder.She was tall and thin with dark, silky hair pulled into a ponytail.When she walked up to their table, Kari realized she was the friend Nina was meeting.She pulled out a chair and sat down.Sorry Im late, she said breathlessly.Had a family who was adopting a cat.Had to finish that up.Kari, this is Shannon North, Nina said.Shes the director of the Rainbow Valley Animal Shelter.Kari shook her hand.Thats a pretty cool job.I bet it keeps you busy.You have no idea.Karis new to Rainbow Valley, Nina said.She started working for Rosie, but shes a little tight on money so shes staying in the cottage at the vineyard.Then she turned to Kari.Shannons meeting me to work on her wedding plans.Wedding?Kari said.Youre getting married?Yeah, Shannon said with a smile.At the vineyard next month.So wheres Luke?Nina said.I thought he was coming, too.Shannon frowned.Funny thing.He said he had to meet the contractor whos building a barn for the rodeo school at exactly the same time we were meeting to talk about the wedding.Wish Id known, Nina said.We could have met at anotheroh.If we met at two in the morning, suddenly that would be the time he was meeting the contractor.What is it with men and wedding planning?He just keeps smiling and saying, Whatever you want.Greg had done something similar with their wedding.Only with him, it had been Whatever your father will pay for.So how are plans going for the rodeo school?Nina asked.Great.Marc was out last week to help Luke repair some of the fence around the property, so now he can start looking for livestock.Shannon smiled.Its his dream, and now its coming true.Ive never seen him so happy.In spite of her words about Luke and his aversion to wedding planning, Kari could tell just how much Shannon loved him.She was practically glowing with it, and Kari would bet her last dollar that Luke felt the same.Thats it, she thought.Thats how its supposed to be.All she could remember about the days before her own wedding was Hilda screeching, her father writing checks, and her own conviction about getting married slowly slipping away.Marc has given Luke a lot of business advice, too.Shannon sighed.Were sure going to miss him when hes gone.Kari came to attention.Gone?After harvest is over, Marc is leaving Rainbow Valley, Nina said.Kari was stunned.Why?Well, if he werent so young Id call it a midlife crisis.But since hes only thirty five She exhaled.Hell, I dont know.Hes got it in his head that he just wants to be by himself for a while.So hes turning the vineyard over to our brother and heading out.For how long?Three years.Then were all coming together again to decide what to do with the vineyard.If Marc wants to come back, well keep it.If he decides to live somewhere else, well sell it and split the proceeds.To be fair, after taking care of other people all this time, hes earned the right to do just about anything he wants to.I just wish leaving wasnt one of those things.Kari couldnt believe it.Here she was trying to integrate herself into this town at the same time Marc was looking ahead to leaving it?A terrible sinking sensation came over her, a sense that something she wanted desperately was destined to slip right out of her grasp.As if shed ever had it in the first place.Sohow are things going between you two?Nina asked.Karis heart jolted.What do you mean?Nina shrugged offhandedly.I just hoped you were getting to know each other.Well, he did come by a few nights ago with that stuff, but She wondered what else to say.It didnt seem right to tell the whole story.Okay, Nina said.Heres the truth.I want my brother to stay in Rainbow Valley.I was hoping youd give him a reason to.You actually think hed stay on account of me?I dont know, Nina said.If you were seeing each other  Were not.Would you like to be?Yes!But he doesnt want me!Or maybe he really did, and it was just the condom issue.He was just thinking too hard about all of it.The trouble was that she could speculate all day long, but she had no idea what was really going on inside his head.Nina waved her hand.No.Forget I said that.Its crazy.You barely know each other.And its none of my business, anyway.Then she turned to Shannon and stage whispered, What do you think?Is there a chance?Shannon smiled.Well, last I checked, Marcs not blind.And Kari isnt, either.Okay.Enough was enough.Kari decided it was time to talk to Marc.The conversation might go nowhere, but they were going to have one whether he liked it or not.Later that evening, Marc grabbed a glass of wine and went out to the deck.Brandy followed him there and lay at his feet, letting out a doggy sigh before closing her eyes for a nap.He hadnt been able to get Kari out of his mind.Hed seen paradise.Lived it for a few blessed minutes.Now he wanted to go back there.He wanted to make up for all the time hed lost in the past eighteen years.He wanted to crawl into bed with Kari and make love to her for hours on end, leaving only long enough to consume the necessary food and water to stay alive.He wanted to make rabbits cry with envy.He wanted to have so much sex that Ripley himself wouldnt believe it.But what had he done?Hed run away from the very thing he was dying to have.Brandy suddenly leaped up, wagging her tail.Marc looked down the path and saw Kari walking toward the house, wearing a pair of shorts and a tight little T shirt.Having a beautiful woman on his property was unsettling.Having a beautiful woman on his property hed seen naked was downright unnerving.He had no idea what she wanted, but she probably hadnt shown up to heap forgiveness on him for what hed done a few nights ago.She climbed the steps to the deck and sat in the chair next to him.Nice night, isnt it?It was.But he didnt think that was what she had on her mind.He certainly didnt have it on his.Yeah, he said.Nice.Wine?No, thanks.Silence.At least the heat seems to have broken, Kari said.It wasnt even ninety degrees today.Uh huh.Is there any rain in the forecast?Surely after the storm a couple of nights ago  I dont think youre here about the weather.No.Im not.She paused.I talked to Nina today.Oh.She told me a few things.Such as?She said Angelas mother was your high school girlfriend.And that she left right after Angela was born.But maybe youd rather she hadnt told me that.Marc shrugged.Its no secret.The whole town knows it.If youd told me, I might have understood the other night just a little bit more.Marc looked away, feeling guilty.But it was a hard thing for him to talk about.Always had been.To this day it still brought back memories of that moment he realized Nicole was gone, leaving him with a newborn baby and no clue how to take care of one.Those had been the most difficult days of his life, ones he didnt like to think about no matter how much he loved his daughter.For a long time they sat in silence, the chirp of crickets grating against the stillness of the night.The evening breeze kicked up a few fallen leaves on the deck until they rustled softly.Shannon was with Nina today, Kari said.They were planning her wedding.Its cool that you guys do weddings here.Uh huh.She said youre leaving Rainbow Valley.So shed found that out, too.Thats no secret, either.Where are you going?Dont know yet.Seriously?Seriously.Im just getting on my bike and hitting the road.Bike?Motorcycle.Her face lit up.Motorcycle?You have a motorcycle?Yes.Oh, my God!I love motorcycles!Can I see it?He couldnt believe the rapturous expression on her face.It was as if she was a five year old kid talking about a paint pony with a silver trimmed saddle.This was a new experience for him.Angela didnt like the engine noise.Nina told him a motorcycle was a death trap whether he wore a helmet or not.Daniels fondness for motor vehicles extended only to those with four tires and a 350 horsepower engine.But this little wisp of a woman actually liked motorcycles?Sure, he said, liking the thought of showing it off to somebody who actually appreciated it.Come on.He rose from his chair.Kari followed him down the deck stairs, and they walked to the garage, where he lifted the overhead door.And there it was.A big, gleaming monster of a motorcycle with a black leather seat and chrome so polished she could have used it as a mirror.Oh, my God, Kari said reverently, walking toward it as if she were approaching the gates of heaven.Its beautiful!Its a touring bike.Made for comfort.I intend to put a lot of miles on it.When I was in college, I dated a biker for a couple of months, Kari said.Rode all over the place with him.When my father found out, he came completely unglued.The biker didnt work out, but Ive loved motorcycles ever since.She glanced at Marc.Mind if I sit on it?He nodded toward it.Go ahead.She slung a leg over it and sat down, holding onto the handlebars.There was something about this beautiful, delicate woman with that powerful engine between her legs, smiling with ecstasy, that made him hot.Hell, was there anything about her that didnt make him hot?Theres nothing like riding on one of these, she said.It feels as if your life is on fast forward.I love that feeling of the landscape whooshing by.Its like youre driving headlong into life rather than sitting around and just letting it happen to you.It makes you feel soI dont know.Free?That was it exactly.That was how Marc felt when he was on the back of a motorcycle.When he was in his truck, it was all about work.When Angela was younger and hed owned an SUV, it had been all about getting her back and forth to school and being a shuttle service for her and her friends.But when he was on his motorcycle, it was all about him and nobody else.Ive always ridden behind somebody, Kari said.I dont know how to ride one alone.She faced him, her eyes alight with excitement.Can you take me for a ride?All at once Marc had a flash of Kari behind him on that bike, her arms wrapped around him, those gorgeous thighs pressed up against his.He only wished he could make that happen right now.Cant, Marc said.I dont have another helmet.Karis face fell into a disappointed frown.Maybe I can borrow one for you.She smiled again.Im going to hold you to that.She stood up and hiked her leg back over the seat, and when she did, she stumbled a little.Marc caught her arm to keep her from falling.As he steadied her, he softened his grip until it was more like a caress, because the last thing he wanted to do was let her go.Since the moment hed met her and found out shed run away from her own wedding, he thought her crazy impulsiveness was something he needed to run from.But nowtonight, this momenthe had the feeling maybe it was exactly what hed been so desperate to run to.I shouldnt have left like that the other night, he said quietly.It was a rotten thing to do, and Im sorry.I understand why you did it, she said, her gaze never leaving his.But I dont think theres anything to worry about.And if we just take a trip to a drugstore, we wont have anything to worry about next time, either.Next time?Marcs heart jolted hard when she said that, and within seconds his brain was already conjuring up images of what next time might be like.But that wasnt the only thing they needed to consider.You know Im leaving Rainbow Valley, he said.I know.But are you leaving right now?No.Then what does that have to do with having sex?Im just not looking for any kind of commitment.What makes you think I am?Youre not?I just got out of a bad engagement, she said.Im not going there again anytime soon.Oh.So were on the same page?Same page?No commitment.No strings.Just sex.How do you feel about that?Holy crap.What did she say?Wait.Nothing on earth was that simple.He knew he should stop and think about this.But as she stared up at him, he couldnt seem to make the logical side of his brain engage.Her carefree attitude was intoxicating.Her talk of motorcycles and freedom and life whooshing by was like crack to him right now.Hed told himself if a willing woman crossed his radar, hed go for it.This one was giving him carte blanche to have the kind of sex hed been dreaming about with the freedom to walk away when it was over.Shed handed him the keys to heaven.Wasnt it about time he took them?Uhokay, Marc said, still a little stunned.I guess we are on the same page.Good.She put her hands on his chest and pushed.Off balance, he took two steps backward and hit the wall.Then she stepped forward, took his face in her hands, and kissed him.He was so startled that for a moment all he could do was let it happen.A tiny part of his brain told him just how crazy this was, but something had changed.Something was different.Crazy was what he wanted, and that was exactly what this woman gave him.She was kissing him hard and deep with a kind of abandon hed never experienced before, as if there was nothing on this earth but the two of them desperate for each other.That was what he wanted.More of her.All of her.Marc reached beneath her shirt and flicked open the front clasp of her bra, shoving the cups aside.He squeezed one of her breasts, then strummed her nipple with his thumb.She moaned against his mouth, then ripped her lips away and jerked her shirt off.Her bra came off along with it, and he yanked them both from her hand and hurled them aside.She trailed her fingers down the front of his shirt, flicking the buttons open.Then she flattened her palms against his chest, dragging them down to his belt buckle.He grabbed her hands.Inside.Not yet, Kari said.She shoved his hands away and had his belt unbuckled in record time.She whipped it out of the belt loops and threw it aside, the buckle clinking against the concrete floor.Seconds later, she had his jeans unbuttoned.She shoved them down along with his underwear just enough to free him.Then she dropped to her knees in front of him.Marc froze with anticipation.No.No way.
