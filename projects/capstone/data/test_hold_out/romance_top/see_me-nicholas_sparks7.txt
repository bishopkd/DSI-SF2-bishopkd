The parking lot outside her door was deserted, the sidewalk empty; no cars she didnt recognize.Her mouth was dry as she locked the door behind her and lifted the rose from the mat.Grabbing the flower that had been threaded through the railing, she forced herself to walk down the steps, her eyes scanning her car.As shed feared, her tires had been slashed.On the windshield, an envelope was tucked beneath the wiper.Later, shed be amazed at how calmly shed handled the discoveries, at the clarity of her thoughts.When she reached for the envelope, she thought about fingerprints and how best to read the letter without damaging any evidence and held the envelope at the creases.In that moment, she felt no panic; rather, she was overcome with a slow, sinking sensation, a recognition of inevitability.Somehow, some way, shed known this was coming.The letter, computer generated, was printed on a single sheet of unlined printer paper, the kind that could be purchased at any office supply store.The final line, however, had been handwritten in boxy, almost childlike lettering.You dont think I know what you did?You DONT THINK I KNOW WHO WAS BEHIND ALL OF IT?You dont THINK I can SEE INTO YOUR MIND and know what YOU DID!You have taken THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT  Your HEART IS FILLED WITH POISON and you are THE DESTROYER!You POISON and you WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH IT You will know how it feels, because I am IN CONTROL NOW  I am the living INNOCENT ONE  SEE ME just as I see you!When she finished the letter, Maria read it a second time, feeling physically ill.The disintegrating rose was still on the windshield and she reached for it, grouping it with the others in a gruesome bouquet.Turning away from her car, she started back toward her condo, her limbs heavy with dread.The signs, she realized, had been obvious, and shed willfully ignored them.All at once, memories sparked like blinding visions before her: Gerald Laws being interviewed by the police, with his neatly parted hair and white teeth; Cassie Manning, her young face distorted with fear; Cassies father, Avery, frighteningly certain of Lawss intentions and possessed of a burning intensity himself; Cassies mother, Eleanor, mousy and silent and above all, frightened.And finally Lester, the nail chewing, nervous brother whod sent her so many terrible notes after Cassies death.Those awful notes, reflecting his gradually escalating anger.Like Lawss letters to Cassie while he was in prison.The first step in a pattern  On the way up the stairs to her door, Marias cell phone rang.Serena.She ignored the call, needing to talk to Colin.She needed him to make her feel safe; here and now, she felt exposed.With shaking hands, she dialed him, wondering how soon hed be able to make it to her place.A pattern  Margolis had told her to come to him with the report, and she wanted Colin there for that as well.She had to tell Margolis about Gerald Laws and Cassie Manning, the woman whom Laws had killed.She wanted to tell him about the Manning family and everything that had happened to her recently.But mostly she wanted to tell him that she knew exactly who was stalking her, and what his endgame was going to be.CHAPTER 19      Colin      S  ince hed started college, Colin had never missed a single class, let alone a whole days worth.Only once had he come close  a day when his car hadnt started, and hed hiked to school carrying a backpack loaded with textbooks, arriving just minutes before class had begun.Therefore, today was a first.As soon as Maria had called, hed raced to her place; hed read the note, and while Maria had called Margolis, hed called a tow truck with a flatbed, since her car was essentially resting on its rims.While they waited for the tow truck to arrive, Colin made Maria a cup of tea, but she was only able to take a couple of sips before pushing the cup away.The tow truck came; once it was gone, Colin drove her to the police station.Maria offered her name to the officer at the front counter and she and Colin took a seat in the small lobby, noting the steady but unhurried rhythm of the station.Maria took the opportunity to leave a message for Barney, informing him that she wouldnt be in for a while.Margolis, no doubt, was already somewhere in the station, probably buried in paperwork from weekend incidents.As a detective, he dealt with significant crimes, and he was probably regretting the fact that hed challenged Maria to call him if she ever wanted to make a simple report.Stalking  if what was happening to Maria officially rose to that level  was below his pay grade, and the fact that Colin was with Maria no doubt made the whole thing even more irritating for him.He made them wait nearly ninety minutes before finally showing up carrying a manila file.While he shook Marias hand, he didnt offer his to Colin, and Colin wouldnt have shaken it if he had.No reason to pretend they liked each other.Margolis asked to speak with Maria alone; Maria insisted that Colin be present.Radiating disapproval, Margolis nodded and led the three of them to one of the interrogation rooms.Having spent time in a number of police stations over the years, Colin knew that on a busy morning, the interrogation room was one of the few places with any privacy whatsoever.Nice of him, even if he is generally an ass, Colin thought.After closing the door and seating them at the table, Margolis set aside the file hed been holding, asked a series of general questions  Marias name, age, address, and the like  and began filling in the report.After that, Maria  in a shaky but surprisingly linear fashion  went through the same story shed told Colin on the beach about Cassie Manning and Gerald Laws, as well as what had been happening to her recently.She sketched out the parallels before finally handing Margolis the letter she had found on the windshield.Margolis read the letter slowly, saying nothing, before finally asking if he could make a copy.When she agreed, he rose from his seat and left the room, returning with a copy.Well keep the original letter in the file, if thats okay, he said, his face displaying little of what he was thinking.Taking his seat again, he read the letter a third time before going on.And youre sure that Lester Manning wrote this?Yes, Maria answered.Hes also the guy whos been following me.Thats Cassie Mannings brother?Younger brother.Why do you think its him?Because some of whats in the letter I heard him say before.When?After Cassie died.He also wrote the same types of things in the notes he sent me.Like what, specifically?The blood of the innocent.My heart being filled with poison.Margolis nodded and made another note.Was this in the first batch of notes, or the second batch?Excuse me?You said the notes changed when they started to arrive again.That they were more threatening and scary.Second group.And how do you know he sent the notes?Who else could it be?Margolis scanned his notes.Avery Manning said that it may have been Cassies boyfriend.It wasnt him.How do you know?According to the police, he wasnt a credible suspect.He was devastated by Cassies murder, but he didnt blame me.He denied even knowing who I was.Did you ever speak with him?No.Margolis made another note.Do you remember his name?Or how he met Cassie?Maria pursed her lips.I think it was Mike or Matt or Mark something like that.And no, I dont know how he met Cassie.But why are we even talking about him?Lester is the one whos been stalking me!Just like he wrote those notes in Charlotte!Didnt you tell me that Lester denied writing the notes when the police talked to him?Of course he denied writing them.And it never crossed your mind that it could have been this Michael?The boyfriend?Why would he?He didnt even know me.He told the police he didnt do it.So did Lester.Have you been listening to me?Lesters crazy.The notes are crazy.It doesnt take much to put two and two together.Do you still have any of the original notes?Maria shook her head, her frustration surfacing.I threw them away when I moved here.I didnt want anything to do with them.The Charlotte police might still have a couple of them, but I cant be certain about that.When you say notes, what do you mean?Just a sentence or two.So not like this one.No.But again, he used the same words and phrases.And there were two short notes that do fit the pattern.In other words, this letter is different.Obviously.Margolis tapped his pen on the report in front of him.Okay.Lets say it is Lester.When you say his notes were threatening, what do you mean?Did he say he was going to hurt you in any way?Or harm you?No, but it was clear that he blamed me for his sisters death.Actually, his whole family blamed me in the end.What was the family like?They were just odd, she said.Their whole dynamic, I mean.How so?Colin turned toward her, realizing that he hadnt heard Maria talk about them in much detail.Avery Manning  the father  was a psychiatrist, and from the very first meeting, he considered himself an expert when it came to criminal behavior.He never let Cassie meet with me alone.He was always there, and he dominated the conversations.Even in the hospital, when I was trying to get the story from Cassie, he would answer for her.It got to the point where I had to ask him to step out of the room, but he refused  the most he would do was retreat to the corner, promising to remain silent while she talked.Even then, I had the sense that Cassie was very careful with her words, like she was trying to say things exactly the way that he wanted.Almost like theyd rehearsed.I think thats why she embellished her stories at times.Embellished?Cassie told me that Laws had hit her before.If true, that would have been important, because we might have been able to make a more serious charge stick.Cassie told me that Laws struck her in a parking lot, and that Lester had witnessed it.Both Cassies and Lesters stories were identical, almost word for word, but when we investigated, we learned that Laws was in another state on the date and time in question, which meant they both were lying.When we talked to Cassie about it, she wouldnt back down.That only made the plea bargain even more necessary.Lawss attorney would have had a field day with her if she had to testify.And the mom?Eleanor.I only met her twice, and she was completely under Averys thumb.Im not sure she ever said anything.Just wept the whole time.Margolis continued to jot notes as she talked.Now lets talk about Lester.What was he like?Again, I only met him twice, and he was like two entirely different people.In the first meeting, I didnt notice anything out of the ordinary.The most normal of the bunch, in fact.But when I met him the second time, after I informed them of the charges against Laws, he changed.Almost like he was afraid of me.Hed mutter that he shouldnt be here, that no one in the family should be near me because I was dangerous.His father kept telling him to be quiet, and then hed just sit there, fidgeting and staring at me like I was in league with the devil.Do you know the name of the psychiatric hospital where he was committed?No.But the notes eventually stopped?After I moved.But now hes doing it again.Margolis twirled the pen before reaching for the file hed originally brought into the room.After you called, I had the Charlotte police e mail the report about Cassie Mannings death; Im still waiting on the report on Lawss initial arrest.I havent really had the chance to dig through it all in detail, but from what I did read, its clear that Gerald Laws killed Cassie Manning.Furthermore, you didnt make the decision that allowed him to plead to a misdemeanor in the first place.It was your boss  am I correct?Yes.Then why do you think the Manning family blamed you?Or, in Lesters case, viewed you as dangerous?Because I was the one they were dealing with.They were counting on me to convince the DA to go for the more serious conviction.And in Lesters case, hes obviously ill like I said, he ended up in a psychiatric hospital.Margolis nodded.Okay.Lets say youre right about all of this, and that Lester Manning is indeed responsible for everything thats been happening to you.He leaned back in his chair.Even then, Im not sure that theres anything I can do.Why not?You havent seen him.No one else has seen him.You dont know who bought the roses, other than that it wasnt your boss.No one saw Lester put the roses into your car.All you know about the guy who ordered you a drink was that it was a young man wearing a baseball hat.Nor did you recognize the guy who delivered the roses as Lester.In other words, you have no proof that it actually is Lester.I told you that the note used some of the same phrases!You mean when compared to the notes you dont have anymore?Again, Im not saying that youre wrong.In fact, I think theres a good probability that youre right.But as a former prosecutor, you know what the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt means.And right now, theres not enough for an indictment under the stalking statutes.Hes been following me, watching me, and monitoring my actions.That meets the course of conduct required in the law.He wrote a note that terrifies me.He slashed my tires.That constitutes harassment.His actions have caused substantial emotional distress, which is why Im here.Hes clearly stalking me and thats a crime.Margolis raised an eyebrow.All right, Miss Former Prosecutor.But if he denied writing the notes once, hell just deny it again.And then what?What about the pattern?Notes, flowers, following me around, dead flowers.Hes mimicking what Laws did to Cassie.The pattern is similar, but not the same.Laws sent letters and identified himself.You received short, unsigned notes.Laws spied on Cassie at dinner and made sure she knew he was there.Someone bought you a drink at a club, anonymously.Cassie knew that Laws had sent her flowers.You dont even really know for sure who sent you the roses.Its close enough.To you, maybe.But in a court of law, its different.In other words, because hes been careful, hes going to get away with it?Youre not even going to talk to him?Dont get me wrong.Ill try to talk to him.Try?Youre assuming that hes still in town and that I can find him.On the other hand, if hes in Charlotte or another city, Ill probably have to turn it over to a detective there.And what would you say to him if you were able to find him?Ill let him know that I know what hes up to, and that its in his own best interest to stop, or the authorities will intervene.When it became clear that Maria hadnt expected him to say what he had, Margolis went on.In other words, I believe you.With that said, I cant arrest him because you think he bought you roses.Or because you think he bought you a drink.Or because you think he put a note on your car.You and I both know thats not going to fly.And, in the end, he might make things even worse for you.Excuse me?she asked.Margolis shrugged.You made an accusation before and the father threatened to sue you and the police.Now youre accusing him again.Its possible that he could make a claim for harassment against you.Thats ridiculous!But its possible.What am I supposed to do, then?If youre not going to do anything to help me?Margolis leaned forward, folding his hands on the table.Ive taken your statement and the report will now be on file.I told you I would talk to him, assuming I can find him, or that someone else will.Ill review the files on Lawss arrest and Cassies death.And Ill find out what I can learn about Lester Manning.Ill talk with the Charlotte police and have them check whether the old notes are in a file somewhere.Considering youve offered me nothing whatsoever in the way of proof that youve been threatened at all  and taking into account your questionable judgment in choosing a boyfriend  Id say thats more than enough, wouldnt you?Marias face was a mask.What about a restraining order?Anything is possible, but you and I both know its not automatic, for all the same reasons weve discussed.But lets say that by some miracle, a judge does grant one.The law says that its not valid unless Lester Manning can actually be served.Which, again, may or may not be possible.In other words, youre telling me to pretend it isnt happening.No.Im telling you to let me do my job.He reached for the file.Ill let you know what I find out.I dont know why I went to him in the first place, Maria said on her way back to the car, her face tight.And you know what really pisses me off?She didnt need an answer.Hes right.About all of it.And I know hes right.If a detective had brought me a case like this, I would have turned him away.Theres nothing in the way of proof.Even if I know its him.Margolis will check into it.So what?Margolis may be an ass, but hes smart.Hell get Lester to say something incriminating.And then what?You think Margolis will convince him to stop?I thought it was over when I moved here, but even that didnt end it.He knows where I live, and for all I know, Lester killed Copo.He might have been inside my parents house!It was the first time that Colin had heard her link Copos death to everything else that had occurred, and her obvious fear made something coil inside him.This was going to stop.Let Margolis do whatever he was going to do, but right now, that wasnt good enough for Colin.It was time, he thought, for someone to find out just what Lester was up to these days.After he dropped Maria off at work, Colin popped in his earbuds, put on some music, and perched himself in front of the computer at his desk.Lester Manning.Proof or not, having a name helped to focus his thoughts, and he wanted to find out as much as he could about the man.The only problem was that without easy access to government databases or official records, there wasnt much he could do.There were no listings in the white pages for anyone named Lester Manning in North Carolina, nor could he find a cell number.There were two Lester Mannings on Facebook; one was listed as living in Aurora, Colorado, and the other in Madison, Wisconsin; the first a teenager, the second a man in his forties.Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat turned up nothing, nor did a general Google search using the name and the city of Charlotte in various permutations.There were a few sites that held out the promise of more information  phone number, most recent address, and the like  for a fee, and after debating, he typed in his credit card number and gave it a whirl.Thankfully, an address popped up in Charlotte.There was a little more on Avery Manning, including a phone number in Charlotte listing an Avery Manning, MD, along with the same address hed found for Lester.Father and son living together?Or outdated information?There were also a few short articles on the father.The most recent one confirmed Marias recollection that Manning had had his license suspended for eighteen months, apparently for improper care of a number of patients.The most prominent case involved a young man whod committed suicide.According to the article, Manning failed to properly diagnose the patients attention deficit disorder and monitor his use of Adderall.Other patients claimed that they simply got worse under his care.If the date of the suspension was accurate, then Avery Manning still wasnt able to practice.Interesting.There was a photograph, too: a man in his midfifties, with thin blond hair and light blue eyes staring out of an angular, almost bony face; to Colin, he could have passed for a washed out gravedigger.Colin couldnt imagine sitting across from the guy for an hour, spilling his guts and hoping for empathy.Another article mentioned Mannings work with prison inmates.The article quoted Manning as saying that many prisoners were sociopaths and beyond practical rehabilitation.Humane incarceration, he said, was the most pragmatic solution to criminal pathology.Other than commenting that Manning considered himself an expert on criminal behavior, Maria hadnt mentioned his work in prisons, and he wondered whether she had even known about it.A little more research eventually brought up the obituary for Eleanor Manning, which said nothing about suicide, but that wasnt surprising.Most people didnt want that fact made public.It also noted that shed been a mother of three, and was survived by her husband and son.Cassie hed heard about, but there was another sibling?He reviewed half a dozen articles on Avery Manning before finding the answer; in an interview on the subject of depression, Avery noted that his wife had battled depression ever since their son Alexander Charles Manning had died in an automobile accident when he was six.Alex.Cassie.Eleanor.So much tragedy for one family.And Lester blamed Maria for one, maybe even two of the deaths.Enough to make Lester torment and terrify her?Yes.The original notes made that plain.As did the pattern.Chronologically or not, Maria was experiencing the same fears that Cassie had.And like Maria, Colin knew how the rest of Cassies story unfolded.After he got out of prison, Laws met Cassie face to face.Cassie filed a restraining order.The police couldnt find Laws.In the end, Cassie was abducted and murdered.Was that part of Lesters plan as well?It was a massive jump to go from what had happened to Maria so far to the final step.Tormenting was one thing, murder was another, and he didnt know enough about Lester to try to guess what he might do.That didnt mean, however, that Maria should take any chances.He spent another hour without learning anything more.So much for the easy part  information that anyone could find  and he wondered about his next step.What did he know about Lester?And what could he assume?Lester had a car.Or had use of a car.Not a big assumption, of course, but he wondered what kind of information he could find if he had a license plate number.A few keywords into the search engine turned up a couple of companies with access to all kinds of public records, including car registrations and license plate numbers.It was a bit expensive, but it just might be helpful, and he made note of the websites in case the need arose.Anything else?Yes, he thought.If he was correct in his assumption, Lester had hidden on the roof across the street when Maria was at work.As for her condo, it would have been easy for Lester to watch her as she came and went, if only because her schedule was predictable.He wouldnt have had to camp out for hours; he could have observed her from the coffee shop across the street or from a parked car.Following her to the restaurant and the nightclub would have been a piece of cake.And?Based on the meeting with Margolis, Colin needed proof that Lester was stalking Maria, and he wondered if he should drive to Charlotte in the hopes of putting a face to a name.Maybe even get a photograph, assuming he could find Lester.But then again, even that might not be enough.The florist had admitted he hadnt gotten a good look at the guy, and Colin doubted the waitress would recognize him.Even Maria hadnt recognized him up close.And finally, there was Copo.The dogs death also fit with the pattern, and the more he thought about it, the more probable it seemed that Lester had killed Copo to hurt Maria and her family.Because hed been following Maria, hed know where her parents lived.But more than that, it also meant that hed watched the family regularly.How else would he have known that Copo had been left behind at the house?Maria had said that Felix brought Copo everywhere, even to the restaurant.That her parents rarely left the dog at home.But how?The Sanchez backyard had a privacy fence, and in a tight knit suburb, a lurking stranger would have been noticed.How indeed.Twenty minutes later, he was driving through the Sanchez neighborhood, trying to piece it together.Her parents house was quiet, apparently no one at home.There were, however, others out and about.A woman jogging on the sidewalk; an elderly man pruning the bushes in his front yard.A man pulling out of his driveway, heading somewhere.Colin turned at the corner, then turned again, heading down the street that ran parallel to the Sanchezes street, backyards bumping up against each other.The neighborhood was bustling, the kind of community where people probably watched out for each other.Lester definitely would have been noticed.Unless  He slowed the car as he approached the houses that backed up to the Sanchez place, and the answer became clear.The house directly behind Marias parents home was for sale.More than that, it appeared to be vacant.Maria was reserved when he picked her up from work that evening, and their conversation was desultory.It was clear that she wanted to avoid talking about Lester or Margolis.She wanted to spend the night at her parents, so he drove her home and waited outside while she packed an overnight bag.Next, he drove her to pick up her car at the tire shop, waiting until Maria was on her way before finally exiting the parking lot.Hed wanted to follow her, but thinking it would only make her more nervous, he asked her instead to text him when she reached her parents place.Fifteen minutes later, she let him know that shed arrived.Though she said nothing, he guessed shed spent the drive to her parents house repeatedly glancing in the rearview mirror, wondering if Lester was following her.Colin waited until after midnight to return to the neighborhood, his mind on Lester Manning.Dressed in black, hed parked a few blocks away and approached the vacant house.In his backpack he carried a small flashlight, a couple of screwdrivers, and a small crowbar.Still, if Lester had been inside the house multiple times  and unless he was an expert in picking locks or had a key  then Colin guessed hed be able to get in through the same window or door that Lester had used.The entry point might still be unlocked; unless the Realtor had noticed it, there would have been no way for Lester to relock it once hed left.Colin just had to find it.And if Lester happened to be there tonight, having realized that Maria wasnt at her condo?As much as Colin itched to exact punishment, hed call Margolis.Maybe they could charge Lester with trespassing, maybe even breaking and entering, in addition to stalking.The street was quiet and empty.On either side of him, through gaps in the curtains of the nearby houses, he saw the occasional television flickering, but he suspected most people had turned in for the night.He reached the vacant house and a quick check of the front door showed a lockbox on the doorknob, courtesy of the Realtor.There were no partially open windows on the porch, nor any pry marks.He went around to the side of the house and noiselessly hoisted himself over the fence, into the backyard.With the flashlight, he inspected the windows one by one, hunting for a small gap or pry marks.It wasnt until he reached the opposite side of the house that he found it.A bedroom window, five feet up, nearly but not fully closed.Pry marks on the frame, no doubt used to take off the screen.Easy for Colin to climb through, despite the distance from the ground, but for Lester?He scanned the yard and spotted an old plastic picnic table set, made for children.Based on four imprints of flattened, yellowing grass, the table from the set had been moved recently.Bingo.Using the screwdriver, he popped the screen off, then wedged the window open a bit farther before pushing it wide with his hands.With a quick jump and climb, he was inside.He walked through the darkened house, observing that the floor plan was similar to Marias parents house, with windows in the kitchen and a family room offering an unobstructed view of the Sanchezes back porch.But the view was almost too perfect, facing both ways, and Colin knew that Lester wouldnt have wanted to be spotted.Which left only one possibility.Colin traversed the short hallway, turning into the only bedroom on the rear side of the house.Unlike the ones in the kitchen and family room, the window that offered a view of the Sanchezes back porch had curtains.Turning his flashlight on, he scanned the pile carpet.Indentations near the window.Footprints.Lester Manning had been here.And there was also the chance that he might return.It wasnt until he was driving home that Colin realized hed overlooked something important.Where had Lester parked?It struck him as unlikely that he would have parked in the driveway of the vacant house, or on the street in front of someones home.It was too noticeable, especially since many people wanted to park their own cars in front of their houses.At the same time, Lester probably wouldnt have wanted to park too far away.Turning around, Colin drove back through the neighborhood, not sure what he hoped to find, until he came upon a park that included a grassy field, a jungle gym, and benches stationed beneath oak trees.On the opposite side of the street, ten or twelve cars were lined up; adjacent to the park were seven more.The lateness of the hour suggested that they belonged to the people who lived across the street, owners with multiple cars and nowhere else to park.However, another car here would be more likely to go unnoticed  ideal for Lester  and he was sure he was right.Pulling his phone from his pocket, he snapped photos of the cars, along with their license plates.He wanted to know which ones belonged.And as he did, his thoughts began to coalesce.He wanted to know what Lester looked like.He wanted to find Lesters car and license plate.He wanted to know whether Lester was staying in the area, and if so, where.Then, after that, he wanted to spend a few days watching and learning everything he could about the man.To what end?Evan asked, squinting at him across the kitchen table; Lily was already asleep in the bedroom.Margolis said that he needs proof.Ill get him proof.Youre sure youre not doing this because you want to beat the crap out of him?Yes.Yes, you want to beat the crap out of him, or yes, youre not going to beat the crap out of him, even though you want to?I dont intend to go anywhere near him.Good idea.Because you have serious issues.Yes.And how exactly do you intend to find him?Are you just going to hang out at the park and watch for strange cars?Probably.Because you think that Lester might one day park there again?Yes.And how are you going to know which cars belong and dont belong?Persistence.Evan was quiet for a moment.I still think it would be a better idea if you just let Margolis do his job.Colin nodded.Okay.After a few hours of sleep, Colin was back in the Sanchezes neighborhood with a notebook the following day.Hed parked a few blocks away and headed to the park, exercising on a floor mat hed brought from home while he waited.It was early, the sun not yet up, and all the cars hed seen a few hours earlier were still there.It was more than an hour before the first person emerged from one of the houses, hopped into a car, and drove off.Colin jotted the make, model, and color in the notebook.There was a flurry of activity at half past seven, and another flurry forty five minutes later.Two more people claimed their cars as Colin was getting ready to leave for class, leaving only a single red car  a two door Hyundai  adjacent to the park, and another two on the opposite side of the street.Probably nothing, but he nonetheless noted the information.On his way out, he detoured down the street with the vacant house.The street was empty, and he decided to risk it.Pulling over a few houses down, he headed for the house before cutting toward the fence.Peeking over, he saw that the plastic picnic table was exactly where it had been hours earlier; the window, too, appeared to be untouched.If Lester wasnt here, then the three remaining cars werent likely his.Call it 99 percent certain.In class, he found himself only mildly interested in what the professors were saying and struggled to take proper notes.Instead, he wondered whether he should head to Lester Mannings last known address in Charlotte or continue to stake out the vacant house.Or, if Maria slept at her place, whether he should watch for Lester there.All good options, but it was impossible to be in three places at once.What if he chose wrong?His mind continued to circle the problem.After leaving campus, he returned to the Sanchezes neighborhood.The red Hyundai parked adjacent to the park was still there, while the two others across the street were gone.The lonely car seemed out of place.Again, on his way out, he stopped at the vacant house and peeked over the fence.No change.Lester wasnt in the vacant house.Which made sense.Neither Maria nor her family were home.He decided to stay as close as possible to Maria for the next few days.If Lester was still determined to exact his revenge, he would eventually find her, wherever she was.And wherever she planned to be, thats where Colin needed to be as well.He called and invited her to dinner; on the phone, she was a little better than she had been the day before, but still tense.He picked her up at her place after work and drove her to a bistro near the beach, where they could hear the soothing sound of the waves.Again, she avoided any talk of Lester or Margolis; instead, she focused on her and Jills plans for the new firm.Talking about the new venture, along with a couple of glasses of wine, was enough of a distraction to raise her spirits.Returning to Colins place, they chatted with Evan and Lily before Maria finally reached for Colins hand.Despite her relative calm, it had been clear to him all evening that Maria had no desire to return to her condo.Colin checked the vacant house on Wednesday morning, making sure to swing by the park and continuing to note the comings and goings of parked cars.Just as he was beginning to think that Lester had either abandoned the viewing post of the house or parked his car elsewhere, Wednesday evening brought a change in that the red Hyundai adjacent to the park was gone.Perhaps it was nothing, but it was time, he thought, to check the license plate, which ended up being a waste of time.Like the others, it belonged to one of the homeowners.On Thursday morning, Colin and Maria were having a breakfast of egg whites, oatmeal, and fruit at his place.She told him she was having dinner with Jill and Leslie and then planned to spend the night at her parents house.Theyre worried about me, she explained, but Colin knew she still wasnt ready to return to her condo alone, especially since Colin had to work.I think theyre also worried about Serena.Why?Because I told them Ive been staying with her the last few nights.Were not married and they have old school values.I know you disapprove of lying, but I cant handle my mothers disappointment on top of everything else right now.I didnt say anything.I know.But I could hear you thinking that I should be honest with them.He smiled.Okay.Have you heard from Margolis?She shook her head.Not yet.And Im not sure if thats good news or bad news.It might be no news.That would fall into the bad category, she said.He didnt exactly inspire a lot of confidence in his determination to attack the problem.For all I know, he hasnt done anything yet.Colin nodded, acknowledging that hed been thinking the same thing.It wasnt what she wanted to hear, however, so he switched topics.Tomorrows the big day.For what?Arent you offering your two weeks notice?Oh yeah.She smiled.And yes, its tomorrow, but its strange, because I barely think about it unless Im with Jill.Its just so surreal.A few weeks ago, I could never have imagined that Id be getting ready to join a start up.What do your parents think?My moms excited, but my dads nervous.He knows how hard it is to start a business.He also liked telling people that I worked for Martenson, Hertzberg and Holdman.For now.Yes.She flashed a wry smile.For now.Hows the mood at the office?She shrugged.Hard to say.Its not as bad as it was last week, but its still gloomy.Work is piling up, and Im hearing whispers that more people are thinking about leaving.Its one rumor after another.Yesterday, there was a rumor that the firm was close to settling the whole thing  with all the plaintiffs  but thats probably just wishful thinking.If you read the EEOC complaints, Ken was a lot worse than even I thought he was.Did you ever tell your parents about him?Not a chance.If my dad had known, he would have gone berserk.Latino blood can run as hot as yours sometimes.Then you probably did the right thing by not telling him.Maybe.But you didnt do anything.Youre not my daughter.She laughed.Hes still not so sure about you.Because of your past, I mean.Okay.And also because of your present persona.Okay.He even has this crazy idea that you were the one who was stalking me.Why would he think that?Because he thinks he saw your car in the neighborhood when he was out walking the dog yesterday morning.I know hes worried about me, but sometimes he can get a little carried away.As can I.       CHAPTER 20      Maria      M  aria kissed Colin good bye on his doorstep; though hed offered to follow her to the office as he had all week, she told him that shed be fine and to go on and head to his classes.In the instant shed said it, shed believed it, but as she drove to work she nonetheless found herself wondering whether Lester might be following her.For the first time since shed moved from Charlotte, she felt her heart beginning to race for no reason whatsoever.Within seconds, it became harder to breathe and her vision began to narrow.Instinct took over and she was somehow able to pull the car to the side of the road, feeling her body suddenly go haywire.Tightness in her chest.Oh my God  This wasnt normal.She couldnt breathe.Her vision continued to narrow and her thoughts began to slip.She was having a heart attack and needed an ambulance.She was going to die on the side of the road.Her phone began to ring, but she only vaguely heard it sound half a dozen times before it went silent.It dinged a moment later, someone texting.The muscles in her chest tightened.She couldnt get enough air.Her heart continued to pound and terror set in, feeding on the knowledge that she was going to die.She rested her head against the steering wheel, waiting for the end.But it didnt come.Instead, she simply continued to die little by little over the next few minutes, until she was no longer dying at all.In time, she was able to lift her head from the steering wheel.Her breathing eased and her peripheral vision was returning.Her heart still pounded, but it felt less intense.A few minutes later, she began to feel better.Still shaky, but better, and though it seemed impossible, she understood that she hadnt been having a heart attack.Instead, she knew her panic attacks had returned.It was another half hour before she felt completely normal, and by then she was already in her office.Barney wasnt around, but hed left a new matter for her  the regional hospital was being sued by a family over an infection called pseudomonas that had eventually led to a patients death  along with a hastily scrawled note asking her to get started on finding the appropriate legal decisions necessary to bolster their defense.She was pondering the entry point for her research when her cell phone rang.She glanced at it, then looked closer, making sure she hadnt been mistaken.Serena?She pressed the button, connecting the call.Hey, she said, whats up?Are you okay?Why?I called earlier but you didnt answer, Serena chirped.Sorry, Maria said, thinking back on the panic attack.I was in the car.The truth, even if it wasnt the whole truth.She wondered what Colin would think about that.How goes it with the investigation?Nothing yet.Have you called Margolis?If I dont hear from him today, I will.I probably would have called already.Im sure.So whats up?What do you mean?You never call me this early.And why arent you in class?It starts in a few minutes, but I just had to tell someone.I got an e mail last night, and it turns out that Im one of the three finalists for the scholarship.I guess the dinner at Mom and Dads must have had a positive influence Though the e mail didnt exactly say it directly, I think I might actually be in the pole position.Pole position?Yeah.You know, when they restart a race following a wreck or whatever, thats the car in the first position.I know what it is.Im just curious how you know what it is.Steve watches a lot of NASCAR.He makes me watch it, too.So its really a relationship now?I dont know theres this really cute guy in one of my classes.Hes a little older though, and hes dating my sister, so that might be a problem.That is a problem.Im just glad you put your ego aside and went to talk to him.It had nothing to do with my ego.Ego, close encounter at a bar fight, same thing.Youre insane, do you know that?Sometimes, Serena admitted.But its worked out so far.Maria laughed.Thats great news, she said.About the scholarship, I mean.I dont want to get too excited just yet.Dont tell Mom or Dad.I wasnt the one who told them last time.I know, she said.Do they still think youve been staying in the dorm with me?Yes.And its my turn to say dont tell them.Serena laughed.I wont say anything.But Im pretty sure Mom knows that youve been staying with Colin.Of course, shes operating under the dont ask dont tell policy, which means it probably wont come up tonight.Tonight?Yeah, tonight.Whats tonight?Youre kidding, right?Moms birthday?Family dinner?Dont tell me you forgot.Oops.Uh  Seriously?Do you never check out my posts?Or my tweets?I know youve got a lot going on, but how could you forget Moms birthday?Shed have to cancel dinner with Jill and Leslie, but theyd understand, right?Ill be there.Are you going to bring Colin?Hes working.Why?Because I was wondering whether to invite Steve.What does one have to do with the other?Its simple.I figure that if Dad is busy glaring at Colin, he wont be able to grill Steve, and theyll think hes great in comparison.Maria scowled.Thats not funny.Serena laughed.Its a little funny.Im hanging up now.See you tonight!After hanging up with Serena, Maria realized she felt strangely nervous as she made her way to Jills office.She didnt think Leslie would be offended  it was an honest mistake  nor did she want Leslie to question Jills recommendation.But when she said as much to Jill, her friend laughed aloud.Are you kidding?Leslie doesnt care about that kind of stuff.Are you sure?Of course Im sure.Its your moms birthday.What are you supposed to do?I could have remembered in the first place.There is that, Jill noted, and Maria grimaced.Surprising her, her cell phone rang again.Thinking it was probably Serena again, she was going to ignore it before realizing that she didnt recognize the number.Who is it?Jill asked.Im not sure, Maria said.After debating for a few seconds, she took the call, praying to God that it wasnt Lester.Hello?It wasnt Lester.Thank God.She listened to the voice on the other end.Yes, Maria finally said.Ill be there.She disconnected the call but continued to hold the phone, thinking about it.Jill must have seen her expression.Bad news?Jill asked.Im not sure, Maria offered, thinking it was finally time to tell her friend about her history with Lester Manning not to mention the drama of the past couple of weeks, including the ups and downs and ups with Colin.The thought of telling everything to Jill wouldnt have bothered her in the past, but volunteering such personal information to her future boss felt risky, even if Jill was likely to find out anyway.Who was it?A cop  Detective Margolis.He asked to meet me.The police?Whats going on?Its kind of a long story.Jill stared at her before getting up from her desk and crossing the room.She closed the door and turned around.Whats going on?she said.In the end, confiding in Jill was easier than shed imagined it would be.Future boss or not, Jill was her friend first and foremost, and more than once, she gripped Marias hand, clearly concerned.When Maria assured her that it wouldnt affect her ability to help with the start up, Jill merely shook her head.Right now, you have more important things to worry about, she said.Leslie and I can handle whatever we still have left.You need to do whatever and take whatever time you need, so that you can find a way to put this behind you for good.Its not as though were going to have clients lining up in the first couple of months anyway.It better not take that long.I dont think Id be able to handle it.I had a panic attack this morning.Jill was quiet for a moment.Ill help you any way I can.Just tell me what you need.Leaving Jills office, Maria realized again that lower salary or not, leaving to work with Jill not only had been the best option available, but already seemed to be the best career choice shed made to that point in her life.What it didnt do, however, was help the rest of the morning pass more quickly.Nor did her workload; wondering what Margolis was going to say made it difficult to concentrate, which only prevented her from gaining traction on her research for the hospital suit.With her frustration beginning to rise, she set her work aside and texted Colin.Yes, he texted back, hed meet her at the station at a quarter past noon.She peeked at the clock.Then back at the claim, knowing she needed to review it closely.Two hours until she met with Margolis.Time inched by.When she pulled into the lot, Colin was waiting outside the station, wearing sunglasses, shorts, and a T shirt.She waved as she got out of her car, hoping it would hide how nervous she was but suspecting that Colin would know anyway.He gave her a quick kiss before pulling open the door for her.Maria felt a sense of dj vu as she glanced around.Unlike their first visit, however, Margolis didnt keep them waiting long.Theyd barely taken their seats before she saw him striding toward them from the rear of the building.Again, he was holding a file, and he used it to motion them forward.Come on, he said.Well talk where we did before.Maria smoothed her skirt as she stood and walked beside Colin, past the others working at their desks, past the group of people collected around the coffeemaker.Margolis opened the door and pointed to the same chairs theyd used before.She and Colin took their seats as Margolis moved to the far side of the table.Should I be worried?Maria blurted out.No.Long story short, I dont think Lesters going to be a problem.What does that mean?she pressed.Margolis tapped his pen against the folder before flicking a thumb at Colin.It seems youre still spending time with this particular problem child.And I dont know why you keep insisting he come with you when we discuss your case.Theres no reason for him to be here.I want him here, she said.And yes, were still spending time together.Happily, I might add.Why?I like his body and hes fantastic in bed, she answered, knowing it wasnt any of his business and not bothering to hide her sarcasm.Margolis smirked, but there was no humor behind it.Before we begin, let me set the ground rules.For starters, the fact that youre here at all is simply because I told you Id look into your allegations, and because I told you Id be in contact.Because your tires were slashed in addition to possible stalking violations, this is a potential criminal investigation, and in such an instance, ongoing investigations are generally not discussed.Still, because theres also the potential for a civil no contact order  the Fifty C  Im choosing to meet with you and keep you as informed as I think appropriate.Also, keep in mind that because Lester Manning has not been served a Fifty C, he has  like everyone else  certain and expected rights to privacy.In other words, Ill tell you what I think is important, but I wont necessarily tell you everything I know.I also want to add that most of what Ive done has been via the telephone.Ive had to rely on a detective friend of mine in Charlotte for a few things, and frankly, Im not sure how much more Im going to be able to ask of him.Hes already gone out of his way, and like me, hes got cases that are higher priority.Do you understand?Yes.Good, he said.First Ill walk you through the approach I took, then a bit of what I learned.Opening the folder, he pulled out his notes.My first step was to familiarize myself with all the background information, so I perused the relevant police files.That included everything having to do with the first assault on Cassie Manning, the arrest and conviction of Gerald Laws, court documents, and finally, information regarding the murder of Cassie Manning.After that, I reviewed your first stalking report  the one you made after you received the notes in Charlotte  and I spoke to the officer in charge of that particular case.It wasnt until late Tuesday evening that I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of everything.Now, with regard to Lester Manning, Im comfortable telling you what you could probably learn on your own with a simple public records search.He glanced down again.Hes twenty five years old and unmarried.High school graduate.He doesnt own any real property and there are no cars registered in his name.He lists his phone number and address as the same as his fathers.With that said, Im not sure how much time he actually spends there.Maria was about to ask a question, but Margolis held up his hand to stop her.Let me finish, okay?Youll understand why I say that in just a couple of minutes.Now, I can share the next bit of information because I think its important to the Fifty C, but Im not going to go into heavy details because those may or may not be important to any future criminal case, all right?He didnt wait for an answer.Since Cassies death, Lester has had some problems with the law.Hes been arrested four times, but not for anything violent or dangerous.Its all minor stuff  trespassing, vandalism, resisting arrest.Things like that.It turns out that Lester has a fondness for squatting in vacant houses.In each case, the charges were eventually dropped.I havent looked into the reasons, but in cases like these, its usually because there was little actual damage.Beside her, Maria saw Colin shift in his seat.Other than that, I wasnt able to learn much, so I called Dr.Manning, Lesters father.I left a message, and surprising me, I got a call back within a few minutes.I identified myself and told Dr.Manning that I was hoping to speak to his son, and I will say that he was entirely cooperative and more forthcoming than I expected.Among other things, toward the end of our second conversation, he gave me permission to disclose the full nature of my call with him to you.Does that surprise you?Maria opened her mouth, then closed it again, not sure what to say.Should I be surprised?she finally asked.I was, Margolis said, especially given the way you described him to me.But anyway, when I asked him if he knew where I might be able to find Lester, he asked me the reason, and I told him that it was regarding a police matter.To which he responded, and I quote, Does this have anything to do with Maria Sanchez?Margolis let the words hang before going on.When I asked him why he brought up your name, he said that its not the first time you accused Lester of stalking.He said that after his daughter was murdered, you made the same accusation regarding some disturbing notes that had been sent to you.He insisted that his son, Lester, was not responsible then, and that he sincerely doubted that he was responsible for anything you were claiming now.He also said to tell you that while he does feel that you made a mistake by opting for the lesser charges, hes well aware that Gerald Laws was responsible for Cassies death, and neither he nor his son blames you for what happened.Hes lying.Margolis ignored her comment.He told me that hes not taking patients at the present time, and explained that hes currently working in Tennessee for the state prison system.He said that he hasnt spoken to Lester in weeks, but that Lester has a key to the house and occasionally stays in the apartment above the garage.He said that Id probably be able to find Lester there.When I asked what he meant by occasionally, Dr.Manning was quiet for a beat, and when he spoke again, I got the sense that Id touched a nerve.He told me that Lester is a bit of a nomad and there are times when he has no idea where Lester sleeps.I think he was referring to Lesters habit of staying in vacant houses.When I pressed him, he added that he and his son are somewhat estranged these days, and for the first time, he sounded almost apologetic.He reminded me that Lester was an adult and made his own decisions and there was only so much he could do as a father.He also added that if Lester wasnt in the apartment at the house, my best bet was to try to find him at work.A place called Ajax Cleaners.Its a janitorial service with a lot of commercial clients.He didnt have the number offhand, but it was easy enough to find, and so my next step was to talk to the owner, a guy named Joe Henderson.Margolis looked up from his notes.Are you following me so far?When Maria nodded, Margolis went on.When I spoke with Mr.Henderson, he said that Lester wasnt a full time or even part time employee.He worked as an on call employee  someone who could cover shifts when they were short staffed or whatever.How could they call him if he doesnt have a phone?I asked that very same question.The way it works there is they post open shifts on the employee section of their website  Henderson said it was easier to get a list of people and have them check than always scrambling to get the shifts covered.I had the sense theres quite a few people who check the list regularly.Anyway, Lester sometimes worked two or three nights a week, but in the last couple of weeks, he hasnt worked at all.Nor has Mr.Henderson heard from him.I found that interesting, so I called the house a couple of times, and no one answered.In the end, I sent my friend over there, and as far as he could tell, no one had been in the house or the apartment for at least a week.There were flyers in the mailbox, newspapers on the porch, that kind of thing.So I reached out to Dr.Manning a second time.And this is where things get kind of interesting.Because you couldnt reach him?On the contrary, he said.Again, I left a message, and again, I got a call back within minutes.When I told Dr.Manning that Lester hadnt been at work and that it didnt appear that anyone had been at the house or apartment, his surprise gave way to concern.He asked again about the police matter  I hadnt yet told him what it was  and I mentioned that I was looking into a case of slashed tires.He insisted that Lester wouldnt do such a thing.He said his son isnt violent; if anything, hes terrified of conflict of any sort.He also admitted that he hadnt been as forthcoming about Lester in the previous call as he could have been.When I asked what he meant, he told me that Lester Margolis reached for a page in the file.Suffers from a delusional disorder, more specifically, persecutory delusions of the nonbizarre type.While his son can generally function normally for extended periods, there are times when the disorder enters a more acute phase, sometimes lasting more than a month.In Lesters case, it has its roots in the occasional usage of illegal drugs.Margolis looked up.The doctor went into a bit more about the specifics of Lesters disorder  way more than I needed to know, in fact  but essentially, it can be boiled down to this: When Lester is in an acute phase  when the disorder moves from simple paranoia to actual delusions  Lester ceases to function entirely normally.In these moments, Lester strongly believes that the police are out to get him and that theyll stop at nothing to put him in prison for the rest of his life.Hes convinced they want to hurt him, and hes convinced they will set other prisoners against him.He also has the same delusions about you.Thats ridiculous.Lesters been stalking me!Im just telling you what the doctor told me.He also told me that Lester had been arrested a few times.It was always during an acute phase, which was why he would resist arrest.The police would generally use Tasers to subdue him, and Dr.Manning added that on two separate occasions, Lester was beaten by other prisoners while he was locked up.That, by the way, goes to what I said earlier about my suspicion as to why the charges were dropped.Im guessing that Lester wasnt coherent and it didnt take all that long for everyone to figure it out.Margolis let out a sigh.But back to Dr.Manning.Like I told you, he sounded worried and he said that if Lester wasnt at the house or working regularly, then he was likely in an acute phase.Which also meant hed likely be in one of two places: either hiding out in a vacant house somewhere, or at Plainview, which is a psychiatric hospital.Lesters checked himself in there numerous times in the past, more frequently since his mother died.In her will, she left a trust fund large enough to cover the cost of his treatment there.Its expensive, by the way.I couldnt get any answers on the phone, so I called my friend again and asked if he could head over to Plainview in person.He did that this morning, about an hour before I called you.And sure enough, Lester Manning is currently a patient there.He admitted himself voluntarily, but thats about all the detective could really tell me.As soon as Lester learned that a detective wanted to talk to him about Maria Sanchez, he just freaked out.My friend could hear him screaming from down the hall and the next thing he knew, a couple of orderlies were rushing in that direction.Like I said, interesting, dont you think?Maria wasnt sure what to say.In the silence, she heard Colins voice.When was he admitted to the hospital?She watched as Margoliss eyes shifted toward Colin.I dont know.My friend couldnt find out.Medical records are confidential and that kind of information cant be released without the patients permission.That clearly wasnt going to happen.At least, not right then.But my friend knows what hes doing, and so he asked one of the other patients, and the guy said that he thought Lester had been there for five or six days.Of course, considering the source, youd have to take that information with a grain of salt.In other words, its possible that Lester slashed the tires and left the notes.Or he might have been in the hospital.And if he was in the hospital, then obviously it isnt Lester.It has to be him, Maria insisted.I dont know who else it could be.How about Mark Atkinson?Who?Cassies boyfriend.Because I looked into him, too.It turns out that he may or may not be missing.What does that mean?Im still doing some preliminary work on that, but heres what I can tell you.Mark Atkinsons mother filed a missing persons report on her son about a month ago.But after I talked to the detective and right before I called you, I spoke with her to get more information, and Im still not sure what to make of it.She told me that in August, he sent her an e mail saying that hed met someone online and that he was quitting his job and going to Toronto to meet her in person.She had no idea what to make of that, but in the e mail, he told her not to worry.He said hed prepaid his rent and that other bills were being paid online.The mother says she received a couple of printed letters from him saying that he was on a road trip with the woman, one of them postmarked from Michigan and another from Kentucky, but according to her, they were  and I quote  vague and strange and impersonal, and not what my son would write.Other than that, theres been no contact with him, and she insists that hes missing.She says he would have called or texted her, and the fact that he hasnt done those things means that something has happened to him.The new information left Marias head spinning, and it was all she could do to stay seated.Even Colin seemed at a loss for words.Margolis looked from one to the other.So thats where I am right now.If youre wondering what my plan is, moving forward, Im going to give the good doctor another call and see if he can grease the wheels and find out when Lester was admitted.Or better yet, have his son give the physicians at Plainview permission to tell me.Depending on what I learn there, I may or may not check into the Mark Atkinson thing.But frankly, thats a lot of legwork, and again, I dont know how much more time I can commit to this.Its not Atkinson, Maria repeated.Its Lester.If thats the case, then for now, I wouldnt worry.Why do you say that?Because, he said simply, as I just told you, Lester is in the hospital.It doesnt make any sense, Maria said to Colin.They were in the parking lot, the sun inching out from behind thin strands of clouds.Ive never met Mark Atkinson.Ive never talked to him.As far as I know, Ive never even seen him.Why would he be stalking me?He wasnt even dating Cassie when Laws went to jail.He didnt come into the picture until later.It doesnt make any sense.I know.And why the hell would Lester think Im out to get him?Its a delusion.She glanced away, her voice becoming quieter.I hate this.I mean, I feel like I know even less than I did before I came here today.And now I have no idea what Im supposed to do, or even what Im supposed to think about all this.Im not sure what to make of it, either.She shook her head.Oh, one thing I forgot to tell you.I had to cancel with Jill and Leslie tonight because its my moms birthday.Ill be at my parents place tonight while youre at work.Do you want me to come by after my shift?No.Dinner will be over by then.My dad makes the meal  its the one time a year that he actually cooks  but its not a big deal.Itll be just the four of us.Are you going to stay there overnight?Or head back to your condo?Im thinking of going home.Its probably time, dont you think?Colin was quiet for a moment.How about I meet you there?Just hang at your parents and Ill call you when my shift is done.Would you mind?Not at all.She let out a sigh.Im sorry that as soon as things started clicking between us, all this had to happen.I hate that youre having to deal with it.He kissed her.I wouldnt have it any other way.CHAPTER 21      Colin      W  hen he got home, Colin pulled the computer from his book bag and set it on the kitchen table.He was as confused about the whole situation as Maria was, and his instinct was to try to learn as much as possible.The first step was to understand the mind set of Lester Manning.Or rather, persecutory delusions of the nonbizarre type.Hed wanted to ask Margolis more about it when it came up, but it wasnt his place to ask, and Maria had let it go.Fortunately, there were dozens of web pages on the topic, and he spent the next hour and a half learning as much as he could.Hed been under the impression that the disorder was similar to schizophrenia, but while certain symptoms like hallucinations and delusions were common in both types of patients, a patient was diagnosed with either schizophrenia or a delusional disorder.Schizophrenia often also included disorganized speech or delusions of the bizarre type.Bizarre meant impossible  the belief that the patient could fly, or read the minds of other people, or hear voices that could control their actions.Nonbizarre delusions  the kind that Lester suffered from  were at least plausible, but untrue.In Lesters case, assuming he suffered from a delusional disorder, it made some sense that he might believe the police were out to get him.According to Avery Manning, the police had used Tasers on him and put him in jail; while there, he had been beaten by other prisoners.And in the end, the charges had been dropped, which might underscore Lesters belief that he never should have gone to jail at all.His paranoia regarding Maria also made sense, Colin admitted, if plausibility was the sole criteria.Not only had Maria failed to protect Cassie, but if Lester hadnt written the notes  as Dr.Manning maintained  then Maria had sent the police after him for no reason.Not just once, but twice now  Margolis had also been right in that a person with the disorder could, as a general rule, function normally, depending on the severity of the disorder.The spectrum of delusions could run from something as simple as overvalued ideas to near psychosis; another couple of the articles stated  just as Avery Manning had told Margolis  that delusions werent rigidly fixed.They could fluctuate in intensity and could be aggravated by the use of certain drugs.Still, as much as everything he read made sense, and while he understood that Lester truly believed his delusions there were aspects of the disorder that didnt line up for him.If Lester was terrified of Maria, would he have delivered roses to her?Would he have sent over a drink?And if those were meant to be peace offerings of sorts, why would he have included the messages he had?Why taunt if what you wanted was to be left alone?And why come to Wilmington to do it?Wouldnt he have wanted to keep as much distance between them as he could?Initially, Colin had wondered why Margolis had bothered looking into Mark Atkinson, but Margolis was smart enough to recognize the same inconsistencies and wonder how to reconcile them.Hence, hed called Atkinsons mother, and from there the story got even more confusing.He may or may not be missing?As vague as it was, Margolis was accurate in his description.A quick search brought up a photograph of a missing persons poster on Pinterest, no doubt created by Atkinsons mother.Other than that, there was nothing at all.He supposed he could do the same kind of search hed done for Lester Manning, but what would be the point?According to Margolis, any information that might be helpful was inaccurate as of the date Mark Atkinson left for Toronto.Or went missing.Or if not missing, was he in hiding?Colin had the sense that Margolis considered it a possibility.The timing was too coincidental for it not to be a possibility.But Marias point was also valid.Why would he target her?According to her, shed never even met the man.Closing the computer, Colin continued to ponder the questions before coming to the conclusion that he needed to clear his mind, and he knew only one way to do that.He ran the six miles to the gym and spent an hour lifting weights, finishing with half an hour of striking on the heavy bag.Without classes in session, the gym was relatively quiet.Daly spotted him when necessary and held the bag for a few minutes, but otherwise spent most of his time in the office.He ran home, showered, and changed into his work clothes and drove to work.Behind the wheel, he pondered the same questions he had earlier.Perhaps his defensive instincts were on high alert, but for some reason, he couldnt shake the feeling that something bad was about to happen.CHAPTER 22      Maria      A  fter the meeting with Margolis, Maria headed back to the office, her head swimming with all she had learned.She stopped to visit with Jill and update her on the latest, but Jill wasnt back from lunch.It reminded Maria that she hadnt eaten, but then again, she couldnt even fathom the thought of eating.Stress.If it continued, she was going to have to buy a new wardrobe in a smaller size or have everything altered; her clothes were already getting loose.Barney was finally back in the office, though he spent the next three hours behind closed doors, meeting with one paralegal after another.She assumed he was interviewing for Lynns replacement  who couldnt come soon enough, in Marias opinion  and though she had a few questions for him about the hospital case, she knew better than to disturb him.Instead, she started organizing her questions, making notes in the margin of the complaint, until eventually she heard a knock at her door.Glancing up, she saw Barney standing in her doorway.Hi, Maria.Would you mind coming to my office?he asked.Oh, hey, Barney, she said, gathering her pages and placing them back in the file, feeling a surge of relief.Thank goodness.I was hoping to talk to you about the complaint.Ive been thinking that there are a few different angles we can take, and I wanted to make sure I was clear on what you were planning to do before I really started to dig in.You can leave that for now, he said.Well go over the case later.Will you join me?Theres something we need to discuss in my office.Despite Barneys outwardly pleasant demeanor, there was something in his tone that made her cautious as she rose from her desk.Whatever he wanted to talk about, she suddenly thought, it wasnt going to be good.Barney trailed half a step behind her, avoiding even small talk, and it wasnt until they got to his door that he reached her side.Always the gentleman  even when about to lower the boom, no doubt  he opened the door and motioned toward the high backed chair farthest from the window that faced his desk.It wasnt until shed moved closer to the chairs that she saw who was already seated in one of them.She came to a sudden halt.Ken.By then, Barney was already moving around his desk.She continued to stand in place even as Barney began pouring three glasses of water from a pitcher on his desk.Please, he said, urging her to take a seat.Theres nothing to worry about.Were just here for a friendly discussion.I should simply tell him, no, thank you, and walk out the door, she suddenly thought.What were they going to do?Fire her?And yet, the old habits began kicking in  the ones about respecting her elders and obeying the boss  and she found herself almost on autopilot as she took her seat.Would you like a glass?Barney asked.From the corner of her eye, she could see him studying her.No, thank you, she said.She could still walk out, she told herself, but  I appreciate you joining us, Maria, Barney said, his drawl just a bit heavier than usual, his cadence a beat slower.It was the same way he spoke when in the courtroom.And Im sure you might be wondering why we asked you to join us.Now  You said there was something we needed to discuss, she interrupted.As in the two of us.Barney flinched ever so slightly, his surprise at being cut off evident but only for an instant.He smiled.Excuse me?You said we, as in you and I.  You didnt say that anyone else would be here.Of course, he said, his voice smoothing once more.Youre correct.I originally asked you to join me.My apologies for misspeaking.He offered an opening for her to respond  no doubt expecting her to dismiss the error  but Colin probably wouldnt have said anything, so she didnt, either.Im learning, she thought.Barney opened his hands.I suppose we should just get to it, then, so as not to waste your time with preliminaries.The last thing I would want is for this meeting to extend your workday.Okay.Inwardly, she smiled to herself.Again, it wasnt what he expected her to say, but Barney was a master of recovery.He cleared his throat.Im sure youve heard the rumors in the office concerning potential allegations by various employees against Ken Martenson.Allegations, by the way, that have no factual basis.He waited, but this time she said nothing at all.Am I correct?he finally asked.She glanced over at Ken, then back to Barney.Im not sure.Youre not sure if youve heard the rumors?Oh, Ive heard the rumors, she said.Then what arent you sure about?Im not sure whether the allegations have a factual basis or not.I can assure you, Maria, that they do not.She waited a couple of beats.Okay.Colin, she thought, would be proud of her right now.More than that, she began to understand how the use of the word okay shifted the power dynamic in the room.Or at the very least, set the tone she wanted, even if Barney didnt like it.He didnt, but he was professional enough to hide it, the drawl and slower cadence continuing in his courtroom rhythm.Because Mr.Martenson is our managing director, the firm intends to vigorously contest these allegations in whatever manner the firm deems best.That includes litigation.Of course, as you know well, when reputations are at stake, cases like this are usually settled to avoid lengthy, expensive, and distracting legal proceedings.In this particular instance, any potential settlement would not reflect on the veracity of the claims, but rather the time, money, and inconvenience that contesting the charges would bring.Obviously, any settlement  if there is a settlement  would be sealed and confidential.Maria nodded, thinking, Just get to the point.Why did you ask me here?Im sure I dont need to review Mr.Martensons stellar reputation with you.Those who know him best  people like you and me  know that he has always kept the best interest of the firm at the forefront of his thoughts and actions.He has made tremendous sacrifices, and its simply not possible that he would have done anything to put either the firm or his own personal reputation at risk.The allegations, I might add, are preposterous.In his nearly three decade career as an attorney in our community, no claims of sexual harassment have ever so much as seen the light of day in any courtroom.Three decades of hard work, now at risk because there are people in the world who are simply greedy.Claims that never reached the light of day because they were settled, Maria thought.Unfortunately, whenever there is a pot of money, there are those who believe themselves to be entitled to it.In some cases, these people may lie outright; in other instances, they distort the truth with a story that fits their agenda.Other times, people simply misinterpret behavior that nearly everyone else would find inoffensive.Its my belief that a bit of all three is what is happening here, and that has led to  in colloquial terms  a feeding frenzy.Some people  these greedy sharks  now sense blood in the water and want to make sure they get their fair share because they believe it is owed them by birthright.But our fair Constitution does not say that youre allowed to take someone elses property because you believe that it should have been yours all along.Greed.Its an awful, awful thing, and too many times, Ive seen good people hurt by it, even my own kin.My neighbors  fine, churchgoing folk, mind you  were ruined by greedy people.But in these twilight years, I usually feel less anger than simple pity for them.Their lives are empty and they believe they can fill that emptiness with the coins from other peoples pockets.Still, Mr.Martensons reputation is at stake, as is the good name of our firm, and I feel a responsibility  even a duty  to ensure that both Mr.Martenson and the firm receive the most vigorous defense possible.He was good, Maria thought, even when distorting the truth himself.She could understand why juries liked him.Of course, I am certain that you feel just as strongly about integrity and maintaining the high quality reputation of our firm.But I do have to tell you that Im frightened, Maria.Im frightened for the other people here.Your coworkers.Your friends.The young families with mortgages and heating bills.Their babies and their children.I feel an obligation to them to use all the skills the good Lord has given me in the hopes that right and fair and good can prevail over wrong and greedy.But then again, Im an old man and out of touch with the way things work these days, so what do I know?When Barney trailed off after playing the deeply troubled card, Maria almost felt like applauding.Instead, she kept a poker face.In time, Barney sighed and went on.I know you, Maria.And I know you share my concerns.Youre too good of a person not to be scared for all your friends and coworkers here.And I know youll want to help them because you dont desire a perversion of justice any more than I do.Our firm  all of us  need to stand united as one against these these greed mongers who have deluded themselves into believing that theyre entitled to your hard earned money, even though they themselves did nothing to earn it.He shook his head.We just want the truth to come out, Maria.Thats all.Just the simple, Gods honest truth.And thats why youre here.Because I need your help.Here it comes, Maria thought.All were asking of you is the same thing were asking of all our employees.We want you to sign an affidavit that simply states the truth: that you have the greatest respect for Mr.Martensons character, and that in your tenure at the firm, you have never witnessed, or even heard about, Mr.Martenson engaging in anything that could be construed in any way as sexually offensive to any employee.In your case, and for our female employees, were also asking that they confirm that they never felt sexually harassed, in any fashion, at any time.For an instant, all Maria could do was stare at him.Ken, she noticed, had sunk lower in his seat, and before she could respond, Barney went on.Of course, you dont have to do this.In the end, whatever you choose to do is completely up to you.There is no reason whatsoever to take into account the livelihoods of anyone else in this firm.All I truly want is for you to do the right thing.Barney finished; by then his eyes were downcast, his body humbly positioned.Barney: a bearer of righteousness in a world he no longer understood, shouldering a burden that had to be borne by someone.No wonder he was so successful.But Maria could think of nothing to say.As persuasive as Barney was he was lying, and he knew it.She also knew that Barney knew that she knew he was lying, which meant all of this was a game.No doubt he wanted Ken in the room as a form of punishment: Do you understand the level to which Ive sunk by defending you?For his part, Ken hadnt so much as mumbled a single word.And yet  Was it fair for the rest of the office  all of whom were innocent  to be penalized?Because of a single idiot?And how much money did the women want?Ken had harassed her, and shed survived.In another couple of weeks, she would likely put it behind her entirely.In time, it might even become the subject of jokes.Ken was a jerk, but it wasnt as though hed exposed himself or tried to grope Maria in the hallway when theyd been at the conference.He was too insecure  too pathetic  to go that far.With her, anyway.But what about the others hed harassed?She wasnt sure, and feeling the need to stall, she drew a deep breath.Let me think about it.Of course, Barney said.I appreciate your consideration.And remember, everyone at the firm, your coworkers and friends, just want you to do the right thing.At her desk, Maria forced herself to stare at the claim that had been filed against the hospital, but every few minutes she found herself replaying the conversation and thinking of ways she could have responded better.She found herself wondering what Colin would have done  There you are.Lost in thought, Maria looked up and saw Jill in the doorway.Oh, hey  Where were you?Jill asked.I came by a little while ago, but you werent in your office.Barney wanted to talk to me, she said.Figures, Jill said, closing the door behind her.How did the meeting with the detective go?Maria proceeded to update Jill on the things Margolis had told her.Like Maria, Jill wasnt sure quite what to think.She asked the same questions that Maria had and was left with the same sense of confusion.I dont know whether its good news or bad news, Jill finally said.Its more confusing now than it was this morning.Thats not my only problem, Maria thought.What are you thinking about now?What do you mean?Your expression just changed.Uh just thinking back on my meeting with Barney.And?Ken was there.Jill nodded.Because of the lawsuit?Of course.And let me guess.Barney did all the talking and he poured on the Southern charm and started talking about doing the right thing?You know him well.Sadly, I do.So did you learn anything?They want to present a united front.Okaaay but what exactly does that mean?They want me to sign an affidavit that would essentially say that I never saw Ken do anything wrong, that hes always professional, and that he never harassed me.Did Barney ask that you sign?Or insist that you sign?He asked.In fact, he made it perfectly clear that he wanted it to be my decision.Thats good.I guess.You guess?When Maria didnt answer, Jill looked at her.Dont tell me theres even more, she prodded.Something you didnt tell me this morning?Well  Let me guess.Ken has been harassing you for a while?Maria looked up.How did you know?Dont you remember our lunch?After youd gone paddleboarding with Colin, when I kept asking whether things at work were going okay?I knew youd gone to the conference with Ken, and Ive been around here long enough to know exactly what he might have tried to do.Even while you were swearing that everything was fine, I had my suspicions.Why didnt you say anything?Jill offered the kind of shrug that asked, Do you really need me to answer that?Office politics suck.Thats why Leslie and I have already outlawed them.Back then, I didnt want to put the idea in your head if it hadnt happened, but I remember thinking that I was correct in my suspicions.Which is terrible, of course.But I was kind of happy, too, and I know how awful that is for a friend to say.What do you mean, you were kind of happy?If you loved it here, you might not have been so eager to throw your lot in with us.Of course, at the time, I didnt know about the potential lawsuits.Im glad youre so concerned with my well being.Youre a strong woman, Maria.And frankly, I think youre smarter than Ken.I knew youd figure out a way to keep him at bay.I did tell him my boyfriend, the MMA fighter, was the jealous type.Jill laughed.Like I said.Way smarter than Ken.Okay, but back to the meeting you had with Barney and Ken, our illustrious leader.So Barney asked you to sign and you essentially told him that youd think about it.Marias jaw dropped.How could you know what I said?Because I know Barney.Hes a master at masking the obvious, showing how his side is the righteous one, and then mixing in a dollop of guilt, in case youre still wavering.Its important for you to put all that aside and think about what actually happened.And by the way, what did happen?Maria then offered a recap of the conference  to which Jill didnt raise an eyebrow  but when she told her about the subsequent encounters, Jill went stony.Hold on, she said.Its one thing to offer the my wife doesnt understand me tale, but youre saying he actually touched your chest?Well, my collarbone or maybe just below.He didnt   But his intent was obvious to you?And he wanted to have lunch and discuss being more of a team player?Yes.But I stopped it from going any further He didnt   Come with me, Jill said, reaching for the doorknob.Where are we going?To see Barney and Ken.Lets just let it go Im leaving anyway.And he didnt actually touch my breast or anything  Well, Barney doesnt know the details.And Im sure that the meeting wasnt only about trying to protect the firm; it was also intended to keep you from joining the other women and filing with the EEOC.Maria shook her head.Im not going to file.Are you sure you dont want to?Maria thought about Barney and the other employees of the firm.Kens attentions had been awful and had caused her stress, but to her mind, simply putting it all behind her and moving on was a far more appealing option than pursuing the matter further.Yes, Im sure.Im leaving anyway.But dont you think Ken should be held accountable?At least a little?For all the stress he caused you?I guess.But like I said, I dont want to go to the EEOC.Jill smiled.They dont know that.What are you going to say?Exactly what should be said.And whatever you do, let me do all the talking.Dont say a word.Before she even realized what was happening, Jill was marching toward Barneys office, Maria racing just to keep up with her.Barneys door was closed, but that didnt deter Jill in the slightest.Barney and Ken, occupying the same seats theyd been in only minutes earlier, were startled by Jills sudden appearance.Whats going on?Were in a meeting  Barney began, but Jill strode into the office, Maria right behind her.Would you mind closing the door, Maria?Jills voice was steady and professional, but determined.Maria realized shed never heard her like this.Did you hear me, Jill?Barney asked.I think you need to hear me.Were supposed to interview another paralegal in five minutes.Tell her that shes going to have to wait.Youll want to hear what I have to say.Its about the lawsuit and it concerns both of you.Ken remained silent and Maria watched as he paled.Barney stared at her before finally reaching for his phone; Maria listened as he did as Jill instructed.After hanging up the phone, he stood from his seat.Let me bring over the chair from the window  he began, but Jill shook her head sharply.
