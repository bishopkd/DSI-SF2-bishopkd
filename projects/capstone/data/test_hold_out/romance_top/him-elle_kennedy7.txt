I chuckle.Yup.Fucker.I lean closer and kiss the tip of his nose.Thats as far as it got, man.I promise.Dont have to promise.I trust you.My stomach churns at his earnest declaration.He trusts me.Fuck, Im such an asshole.Because trust was the last thing I felt today when I was imagining Jamies hands all over that chick.And the fact that shes rocking a vagina makes it a thousand times worse.Ive never had to worry that the guy in my bed might choose a girl over me.Then again, Ive never cared what the guys in my bed did after they left my bed.Its different with Jamie.I feel sick when I picture him leaving me.I feel sicker knowing Im competing with not one, but two gender pools for his affection.Except I wont have his affection for much longer.Once camp is over, well be going our separate ways.I hadnt been joking around with Cassel the other dayif I want to succeed in the pros, I need to keep my pants zipped.But I think we need some ground rules or something, Jamie says ruefully.I swallow.Me and rules have always had a love hate relationship.Like what?Like as long as were fooling around, were exclusive.Ha.Because Im so interested in screwing anyone else.Still, I nod in agreement, because I happen to be very interested in making sure he doesnt screw anyone else.Deal.What else?He purses his lips.Ahthats all Ive got right now.You?Reluctance jams in my throat.I know I need to say this, but I dont want to.Ive wanted this guy for so fucking long.Forever.And the thought of letting him go in less than a month rips me apart.But Im going to have to.We end it when we leave for training camp.My voice comes out hoarse, and I pray he cant hear the note of pain in it.We only have the summer.Jamie goes quiet for a moment.Yeah.He sounds equally hoarse.I figured.I cant tell how he feels about that.Disappointed?Sad?Relieved?His expression reveals nothing, but I decide not to push for answers.Besides, Im the one who came up with that rule.I should be glad hes not fighting me on it.We should go to sleep, I murmur.Yeah.He closes his eyes, but instead of rolling over, he shifts closer and kisses me.I return his kiss softly.When I put a hand on his hip, the fabric crinkles beneath my fingers in a way that feels unfamiliar.Theyre not his usual underwear, so I break our kiss to squint at them in the dark.Canning, I whisper.Are you wearing your boxer shorts with kittens?Even in the dim light I can see the corners of his mouth twitch.So what if I am?For some reason, this makes me unthinkably happy.I lean in to touch my smile to his.But Jamie squirms a little, as if uncomfortable.Then he sticks a hand down the back of the aforementioned boxer shorts and brushes something.Everything okay back there?I ask, wondering if hed left the tag in them.Just, uh, a Skittle in my shorts.We both chuckle even as our lips meet again.And again.Finally Im able to relax.His arms close around me and it feels like coming home.Our mouths fit together so perfectly.Every time we kiss, I fall even more in love with him, and it has nothing to do with sex or lust.Its him.His closeness and his scent and the way he soothes me.My life has been chaotic for as long as I can remember, and I always dealt with it alone.My parents criticism, my confusion over my sexuality.But for six weeks every summer, I didnt have to be alone.I had Jamie, my best friend, my rock.Now I have even more of him.I have his strong arms around me and his lips lazily brushing mine, and it absolutely kills me that I have to give him up when I go to Toronto.We kiss for a while.Theres no urgency to do anything more than that.Our dicks dont even enter the equation.We just lie there making out, while his palms stroke up and down my back in sweet, reassuring glides.Eventually we fall asleep with my head on his chest and the sound of his steady heartbeat beneath my ear.26      JULY      Jamie   Several days later, I get an email from my agent.A year ago, I loved saying that.My agent.Sounds pretty important, no?Not so much.When I was a kid I collected hockey cards.They came in packs of ten with a lousy piece of gum that tasted awful.In every pack thered be one good playerhopefully not a duplicate of a card I already hadand nine guys youd never heard of.Those nine went in the bottom of my shoebox, where they waited.Every once in a blue moon one of those guys would rise in the ranks, but usually they didnt.Fast forward ten years.To my agent, Im one of those cards at the bottom of the shoebox.In fact, its unlikely the emails I get from him are even written by him.This one asks me for the date Im moving to Detroit.The club will put you up in a hotel near the rink until youve found housing.Attached you will find the real estate agents contact information.Please set up an appointment with the realtor once youve arrived in Detroit.The end of summer crawls closer every day.Im not going to be able to put off these plans any longer.Between sessions at the rink on Thursday, I look for Pat in his cramped little office.Since Id promised my mother Id try to come home, I need to find out if thats possible.Got a second?I ask from the doorway.Pat beckons to me, then turns away from his computer screen.Whats up, Coach?Still tickles when he calls me that.Campers get whats up, kid?Im trying to plan my life, which is always a fun time.So I need to know how youre doing with your personnel shortage at the end of the month.He gives me a thoughtful stare.Sit down, Canning.I drop into a chair feeling like a kid whos been called to the principals office.And Im not sure why.But theres something serious in his expression, and I think Im about to find out what it is.I havent heard you mention Detroit all summer, he says, folding his hands into a tent.Why is that?Um.Been busy.And you dont want to know with what.Pat smiles at me, cocking his head.Not buying that.Sorry.A man whos getting everything he wants in life cant stay silent about it.Not even you.Damn it.Coach is going all head shrink on me.Its I dunno.Not quite sure how its going to work out, thats all.Maybe in a year I wont be able to shut up about it.His nod is slow.Thoughtful.I feel like an amoeba under a microscope.You know I think youre a hell of a goalie.You put your heart into it, and someone is going to notice.Even if it takes time.Its kind of hard to swallow all of a sudden.Thanks, I manage.But I find myself wondering if youre feeling it.Not everybody wants to get on that treadmill when he could be, say, coaching instead.Now its my turn to stare across the desk.Who would hire me as a coach?Pat makes a show of looking up at the ceiling before meeting my eyes again.Lots of people, Canning.Youve been coaching your ass off here every summer since you started college.Id be happy to tell anyone wholl listen.And you had great stats in college.Best stats on your team.Rainier might even want you.Its sort of dizzying to allow myself to think about this.Coaching?As a full time gig?That sounds like a blast.Coaching at the college level would pay me a living wage, too.Id just never imagined I could have a job like that.But Pat knows people.A lot of them.All over the country.Where would I want to be?The idea pops out of my mouth before I can think better of it.Do you think someone in Toronto might need a defensive coach?Pats bushy eyebrows lift, but only for a split second.Dunno, Canning.They dont play a lot of hockey in Canada.Then he bursts out laughing.Lemme see what I can learn.I leave his office feeling lighter, even though nothing has really changed, except theres a new idea in my head.But its a hell of an idea.Its the Friday of parents weekend, so coaches have tonight off instead of Saturday because were required to be at a special dinner with the parents tomorrow.When Wes and I were campers, neither one of us ever had visitors on parents weekend.My clan couldnt exactly buy airfare for seven people and drop everything to watch me play a scrimmage in upstate New York.And Wess parents They just didnt bother.His father liked the fact that his son sometimes won state championship games, but if there wasnt any way to brag about an event, he didnt see the point of showing up.And Wes's mom?Ive never even met the woman.Sometimes I wonder if she even exists.As coaches, parents weekend means we have to show up and look attentive.Pats camp is funded by tuition checks from parents, and when those parents stop by, they want to be sure their kids are getting 24/7 attention.The kids dont really want 24/7 attention, of course.But thats not our problem.Wes and I are just back from the rink and trying to sort out our options.So tell me about this outdoor concert, he says.Is that what were doing tonight?Wes is scrolling through his messages.I think the music could be okay.He looks up.Says the man with boy bands on his phone.That was a joke, I sputter.Weve been over this.Wes cackles.Tell you whatlets make a deal.Its been a while since I had a steak dinner.You find me a steak, and Ill subject myself to this concert.Here, man.I pretend to unbutton my fly.He throws a pillow at me.Feed me, Canning.Bad local music is easier to take after a porterhouse.I pull out my phone.We can use your car, right?Sure.Most of the restaurants in Lake Placid are burger joints, but the Squaw Lodge Boathouse on West Lake looks like the real deal.And since the outdoor concert is in the same direction, I make a reservation and hope for the best.Then I go over to the closet we share and fish out Wess one polo shirt.Dropping it on Wess bed, I find a button down shirt for myself, and a clean pair of khaki shorts.You want me dressed up?Wes asks, hoisting the shirt over his head.Are we going on a date, Canning?Seems so.The steak place looks nicer than swim trunks and flip flops.So its my fault then.His words are grumpy, but hes admiring my chest while I button up the shirt.You clean up nice, honey.I flip him off.Wes heads to the bathroom to brush his teeth, and I watch him go.I even catch myself admiring his ass.Lately I find myself sneaking looks at him, trying to raise some kind of holy shit reaction to the idea that Im involved with a guy.When I was young I used to try to scare myself walking through the woods alone.Id peer into the shadows and imagine something terrifying waited there, just to give myself a little thrill.But it never worked all that well, and neither do my attempts to frighten myself over recent events.Because its Wes.Hes not scary.And the things we do in bed are just plain hot.As it happens, the lodge is a nice restaurant.But were not underdressed, because the place offers dockage.In other words, some of the dinner guests have arrived on small watercraft, looking wind tousled and sunburned.We dont get a table outside, because I only made the reservation an hour ago.But the interior is dark and sleek, with leather upholstery and candles flickering on the tables.Were shown to a comfortable booth in back, and I slide onto the seat feeling like this was a damn good idea.I smell garlic bread, and theres a microbrew beer list a yard long.Were going to eat like Vikings, Wes says, giving the hostess his cockiest grin.Which steak is the best one?The girl is all too happy to stay and chat.The creole is popular, she says with a toss of her hair.I like the New York strip, though.Do you now.Thanks for the tip.She walks away, shaking her hips, and I bite back a grin.You were this close to making a bad strip joke, werent you?Be honest.Wes reaches across the table to cover my hand with his.He makes a dead serious face, the kind he only makes when hes pulling my chain.I was this close to making a good strip joke.Duh.Thats when the guy sneaks up on us.Good evening!Im Mike, and Ill be your server this evening  Calmly, Wes removes his hand from mine and looks up at the waiter.The man glances from Wes to my hand and back again.Welcome to the Squaw Lodge Boathouse.Have you dined with us before?His voice has taken on a slightly different tone.Softer, with a riff of affectation in it.Im distracted, but Wes looks him straight in the eye and says, Actually, its our first time.Oh!Well, youre in for a treat  He and the waiter discuss the menu, but I tune out.This is the first time someone has looked at me and decided I was a gay man out on a date, and Im trying to figure out how I feel about that.Dont get me wrongId be seen anywhere with Wes.Any day of the week.But theres something strange about becoming his dinner date.Like Ive shrugged on someone elses costume and Im playing a role.I order a beer and a steak when its my turn, and the guy runs off to put in our order.You buggin?Wes asks, nudging my foot under the table.No, I say quickly.Im not, either.I dont give a shit whether we set that guys gaydar off or not.Wes actually winces.Wouldnt blame you if you did.Look, that dude is only jealous.But some people are assholes about it.I mean, the things you and I do every night are illegal in some places.Youre really selling it to me then.His grin is wry.There are benefits.Yeah?Hit me.Whats good about going gay?I nudge him back under the table.Well, dicks, he says.Obvs.Obvs.He smiles.Okay, now picture this.You wake up on a weekend beside your really hot boyfriend, and fuck like horny hedgehogs for a couple of hours.Then you spend the rest of the day watching sports on television, and nobody ever sayshe pitches his voice highhoney, you said we could go to the mall!Now Im laughing.And I guess you can leave the toilet seat up, right?Wes spreads his hands.See?Benefits everywhere.And heres one morethe parents dont nag you for grandchildren.I have five siblings, I point out.Theyre guaranteed at least a basketball team.The waiter brings our beers, and I actually give him a wink before he goes.Look at you!Wes crows after he walks away.You could be good at this.Like its hard?Wes is grinning at me, and I hate to kill the mood.But I realize that Ive got a question for him thats been bothering me.What did your parents say when you told them?His face falls.Well.At first they didnt believe me.My mother said, This is just a phase.And my father said nothing.When was this?Freshman year of college.I decided to tell them on the way to my grandfathers house for Thanksgiving.We were all trapped in the car together.Nice timing.He shrugs.I didnt even know what to do with that reaction.It never occurred to me theyd just sort of ignore me.Though in retrospect it makes plenty of sense.His dull admission brings an ache to my heart.It also makes me wonder how my own family would react if they knew I was hooking up with a guy.But no matter how many times I try to picture their expressions filling with horror or disgust, I cant see it.Support is all Ive ever gotten from them.So what did you do?I ask, hoping my inner distress doesnt show on my face.Well, Canning, this is me were talking about here.So I got really fucking mad.And next time I was home on break I picked up a guy at a party and blew him in the family room when I knew they were on their way home.Yikes.That probably got the point across.Wes takes a long pull of his beer and I watch his strong throat work.It did the trick.My dad did all the yelling I expected him to do the first time.He said I was disgusting.And that I was going to fuck up my hockey career.Hell.Thats still his biggest concern.Ouch.What does your mom say?He never mentions her.How can a mother not defend her son?Shes his yes man and pearl clutcher in chief.So she never says much.Shit, I really killed the mood.But luckily our appetizers arrive a moment later, and were happy again.Sometimes its just that easy.27      Wes      I drive us a mile farther up the road to the park where the band is playing.Neither of us has ever been to this place before, but its nice.A lawn runs all the way down to the water.A band shell has been set up near the shore, and people of all ages are settling down on the grass.We find a spot easily enough.I sit down, but Jamie doesnt.Shit.I didnt think this through, he says, eyeing his rather nice pair of khaki shorts.I look up at him.And here I thought I was the gay dude.He smacks the top of my head.Tomorrow is Pats parents weekend.Im just trying to represent.Fine.I stand up.Wait here a second.I jog to the car and dig an old plaid blanket out of the back.When I rejoin Canning, I give him a cocky smile.See?Its a good thing I never clean my car.I spread it out on the grass and flop down.Jamie sits beside me.We both lean back at the same time, and my hand comes down on top of his.So I move mine a couple inches to give him space.But he moves his too, covering mine.I dont want him to know how much I like that, so I dont look him in the eye.Instead, I stare up at the darkening sky over the lake and wonder how Ive made it to age twenty two without ever going on a date.Id teased Jamie about it earlier, too.But here we are.Dinner and live music.Sitting on a fucking blanket in the park.Ive never dated anyone before, and Im probably not very good at it.After a while the band starts up.There are four of thema singer, a guitar, a double bass and percussion.The first song they play is a weak cover of a Dave Matthews song.Huh, Jamie says.What?Im worried.About the music?Im in a mood to be generous.Theyre just warming up, right?Every band covers Dave Matthews.Its a law, I think.Unfortunately, things dont improve.Could that be an old tune by Billy Joel?Jamie asks.I listen hard for a second.God, maybe.It sounds like theyre trying to play New York State of Mind.Not sure theyve quite got it.I flip my hand over and squeeze his fingers as the sky grows darker.By the third song, its so bad its funny.The lead singer looks out into the crowd and announces, Were going to play an original tune that my friend Buster wrote.Jamie and I both clap, like we know Buster.Go Buster.Its called Captive Rain, and were giving this song its world debut.The drummer counts them in, and the first four bars arent so bad.But the lyrics are awful.I dont know what the guy is singing about.Captive rain is coming at him like a. ..train.Oh my God, Jamie whispers.His hand lands on mine again.As the song progresses, I can feel him start to shake beside me.Shh!Im trying to hear the music, I say, and he pinches me with his free hand.Dude, he just rhymed chicken with stickin.Jamie snorts and I reach across my body to clamp a hand over his mouth.So he sticks out his tongue and licks my palm.So I wipe that on his shirt.Seeing as were seconds away from repeating our experiments with MMA, I make a suggestion.Time to swim?His eyes cut over to mine.I dont have a suit.Seriously?When the song finally ends, Jamie jumps up and heads for the trees that border the lawn.I wad the blanket under my arm and follow him.Hes waiting a few yards into the woods.Look out for poison ivy, he says, and I freeze, looking down.Made you look!Jesus, Canning.He laughs and picks his way toward the waters edge.We cant see the people on the lawn from here, but we can still hear the band.Its almost completely dark, which is good for us.There are some rocks at the waters edge, so I toe out of my shoes and put them in a safe spot.Then I strip off my polo.Jamie is laying his clothes on the rock almost daintily.Hes even removing his shorts.Id forgotten he was trying to keep them clean.Dare you to skinny dip.Of course Im skinny dipping, he says.Well then.Cant let him do that alone.I drop every thread of my clothing onto the rocks.Its not a hot night, but when I wade into the water, the temperature isnt too bad.I turn to watch Jamie step toward the waters edge, and I like what I see.The dim light makes shadows in the valleys of his abs.I wade in deeper, and the water caresses my bare skin.This is decadent.The sound of Jamies chuckle makes me smile in the dark.When he reaches me, I take his hand, and he lets me.Together we duck under water, swimming out just a little ways.Some of the people on the lawn probably have an oblique sightline of us by now.Then again, its awfully dark.Were in up to our necks, and the lake is both beautiful and a little creepy if your mind works that way.I wonder if Jamies does.I think I just felt something brush my foot.I didnt, but Jamie doesnt know that.He twitches a little.Probably just a sunfish.Uh huh.Youre right.I maneuver my foot under the water, finding Jamies calf and grazing it with my toe.He lurches away from me.You asshole.That gets me laughing, and Jamie splashes me.The bottoms kind of sludgy here.And this is true.I worry about leeches.Did you ever see Stand by Me?Ugh, he complains.Way to ruin it.He moves closer to me.All at once he springs forward, grabbing my shoulders, wrapping strong legs around me.Now they can only find you.He kisses me.Jesus.So sexy.I open for him and our tongues tangle right away.I moan into his mouth, and it doesnt matter, because the music is going again, and the darkness gives us plenty of privacy.Jamies fingers weave into the hair at the back of my head.He tastes like good beer and sex.Im standing in a lake with the most beautiful man wrapped around my body, and his dick is hard against my belly already.This must be what heaven is like.I cup his ass, unable to resist sliding a finger down his crease and teasing his hole.He moans into my mouth.You are goddamn addictive, Wes.Thats what I like to hear.Ive only fucked him one other time since that first night almost a week ago.Our second time, I took him from behind and had to cover his mouth the entire time to stop him from making noise.I want him again now, but screwing in the lake isnt really an option.No condom or lube, a lawnful of people less than a hundred yards away.I move my hand to his groin and give his erection a soft stroke as our tongues tangle in a hungry kiss.Then I jump, because his hand is on my backside now, his fingers traveling between my ass cheeks.Gonna fuck you one of these days, he whispers.Yeah, I know he will.I know Ill let him, too.Maybe one guy soured me on the idea of taking it, but with Canning, Ill take anything he has to give me.Ill take it all.His finger breaches my hole and I hiss out a breath.Jesus.Id forgotten how sensitive all those nerve endings are.You like that, huh?Droplets cling to his perfect face as he smiles at me.A filthy, beautiful smile.Mmm hmmm.I jam my tongue in his mouth again, grinding my cock against his as he tentatively plays with my ass.He kisses me back, just a brief taste, before breaking our mouths apart.Hes in the mood to talk.No, hes in the mood to torment.So tight, he sighs.The angle allows just the tip of his finger to penetrate me, but even that is deep enough to make me moan.My dicks gonna like being in you, Wes.His lips latch onto my neck, dropping greedy kisses on my wet skin.And youre going to be begging for it.I shiver.I think hes right.When his finger disappears, I bite back a disappointed groan.That fleeting tease had turned me on like nobodys business.But not tonight.He says it decisively, as if hes carrying out some conversation in his own head.That dirty smile returns as he leans in to nibble on my jaw.Tonight, I want you to fuck me.Ive been thinking about it all day.I growl.You need to shut up, Canning.Otherwise Ill do you right now.Bend you over that log over there and take whats mine.Wet lips place a kiss right under my jaw.Promises, promises.Then he disentangles from my body and swims backward as if he has no care in the world.Swimming with a hard on is extremely difficult.But maybe I should be thinking of my stiffy as a floatation device.Or an oar, because God knows its long and hard enough to single handedly propel an entire fucking canoe.We swim side by side for a while, then float on our backs and stare up at the inky black sky.I laugh when I notice both our cocks slicing upward as if to salute the moon.Should we do something about those?I crack.Jamie chuckles.Yeah, probably.Im dying over here.Me too.In unspoken agreement, we swim back to shore, our naked bodies dripping lake water all over the muddy bank.Jamie stares at his pristine clothes, then says, Fuck it.He puts on only his boxer briefs, and holds on to the rest.I do the same, and luckily we dont encounter anyone on the quick walk back to the parking lot.His briefs are black and my boxers are navy blue, so theres no peekaboo happening with our dicks, but still, traipsing around in our underwear might be a bit too racy for Lake Placid.A moment later, were in the car.I put it in drive and breeze out of the lot, tensing when Jamie reaches over and strokes my package over my wet skivvies.Wont be able to drive in a straight line if you keep doing that, I warn him.Eyes on the road, he teases.Dont worry, were not going far.I wrinkle my forehead.I was planning on driving back to the dorm, but Canning apparently has other ideas.Weve traveled no more than five minutes when he nods to a gravel path to our right.Turn there.A grin tugs on my lips when I realize what he has in mind.Its the pull off to one of our old hiking spots.The area is usually deserted even in the daytime, so at night there definitely wont be anyone around.I park in the small dirt clearing near the trailhead, and before I can even kill the engine, Jamie is climbing into my lap.28      Jamie      I wasnt exaggerating before.Im addicted to Ryan Wesley.And right now I desperately need a fix.A couple of weeks ago, getting it on with a dude had freaked me out.Now its as obvious as breathing that everything about this guy turns me onhis raspy voice, his powerful body, the tattoos inked all over his golden skin.My mouth is on his in a heartbeat, my tongue down his throat as I straddle his muscular thighs.He sighs against my lips.Youre such a horndog.I totally am.I rock into his lower body, my palms skimming up and down his broad chest.The question now isnt whether I want to fool around with this man.The question is how Im ever going to give it up.I push that thought overboard, though, because Im about to combust.But I might have been too hasty with my choice of hook up spots, because the front seat is too small to accommodate two horny as fuck hockey players.My legs are already starting to cramp, and when I shift around trying to get more comfortable, my back hits the horn and a blast of sound hits the air.Wes bursts out laughing.Then laughs harder when I make another attempt to reposition myself.Backseat?he chokes out.Much better idea.He climbs over first, his butt cheek smacking me in the face as he heaves himself into the back.I land on him with a thud, and now were both laughing our asses off.Its just as cramped back here.We cant lie side by side, so Im on top of him, and when I bend down to kiss him, my forehead slams into the door handle.And when I grab my head in surprise, I manage to elbow him in the eye socket.Holy fuck!Wes yells.You trying to kill me, Canning?No, but  Abort!he says between laughs.Screw that.All this shifting and maneuvering has succeeded in my rubbing my aching dick all over his body.If I dont get off soon, Im going to lose my mind.Weve got this, I tell him.Then I sit up and bump my head on the car roof.Uh huh, he says solemnly.Seems like it.Hockey players like it rough, I argue, reaching into the front seat for Wess shorts.In the back pocket I find his wallet.A second later, I flick a condom at him and order, Suit up.Yes, Coach.He still looks like hes trying not to laugh, but his gray eyes are now glittering with lust.Keeping our gazes locked, he eases his boxers down his hips.I shuck my briefs as he covers himself, then curl over and take him in my mouth.The medicinal taste of the latex fills my mouth, but I ignore it.This is the first time lube hasnt entered the equation, so I want to make sure the condom is nice and wet before I dare ride his cock.God, and thats something I never imagined Id be doing.Riding another mans cock.Baby, his voice is low and husky.Im loving that, but you dont have to do it.Give me my wallet.I fumble into the front seat one more time and pass it to him.He removes another packet and tears it open.This one is full of lube.A second later, a deliciously slippery hand slides up my crease, rubs my taint and makes me shiver.Thats handy, I rasp.He doesnt answer.Hes too busy working me open with his fingers.When we do this, theres always one awkward moment when he first breaches me.Before my body gets the joke.But now that I know how this works, it doesnt even slow me down.Im eager for it.And its only a couple of minutes later when Im pushing Wess hand away and straddling his lap again.The way I handle him is nothing like the way Id touch a woman.Hes as big and strong as I am, and I dont have to worry about hurting him.His broad shoulders make a sturdy place to put my hands.Rising up, I wait for him.He positions himself beneath me, and we both hiss when I slide down over his hard cock.For a moment I dont move.Were nose to nose, blinking into each others eyes.Wess tongue emerges to slick my lower lip.And I dive onto his mouth, jamming my tongue inside.There isnt a lot of space for me to move, but it doesnt matter.Im riding him in short, fast strokes.The angle is heavenI can bear down on him just where I need him.Wes is cupping my ass in strong hands, and with each thrust, he lets out a sexy grunt.Our chests rub together as our mouths lock again.My dick is trapped between our stomachs, slicking us both with pre come.My climax takes me by surprise.One second Im fighting Wes over whose tongue belongs in whose mouth.The next, Im fighting the urge to explode.And losing.Fuck.I have to come.Wes moans into my mouth, and I jam myself down on him one more time.Thats when I feel itthe whole body orgasm.My limbs tingle unpredictably as I slump forward, my face landing in Wess neck.The world goes fuzzy at the edges, but I feel myself shooting all over him while he bucks beneath me.He lets loose a growl, and the muscles in his neck tighten all at once.Then he drops his head back and shudders through his release.Heavy breathing and thudding hearts are all that can be heard in the car afterwards.Im lazing against his sticky chest, too blissed out to move.His hands trace lazy patterns over my back.I could get used to this.I really could.After a bit, Wes slaps me on the ass.Up, baby.We cant stay here forever.I hate the way that sounds, but its hard to argue the truth.So I peel my satisfied body off his, and we begin the ridiculous process of trying to clean up in a confined space without further injury.We manage, but just barely.Wes and I drag our bleary selves out of bed the next morning and book it over to the rink, where the other coaches already congregate.The parents are arriving at nine, the first scrimmage is scheduled for ten, and Pat has a prep list thats a mile long.He begins to bark instructions once Wes and I round out the group, then stops midsentence when he notices Wess face.What the hell happened to you, Wesley?I press my lips together to fight a laugh.Our sexual circus act in the car last night left Wes with a nice shiner on his left eye, courtesy of my wayward elbow.Its not black, but definitely purplish, and visibly swollen.Canning beat me up, he says gravely.Pat flicks his gaze to me, then back at Wes.Whatd you do to piss him off?Wes mock gasps.You saying I deserved it, Coach?Im saying youve got a smart mouth and its a miracle you dont get wailed in the face every day of your life.But Pats grinning as he says it.Then he claps his hands and gets back to business.Maybe you boys can kiss and make up on the trip to the supermarket.Youre on ice duty.Make sure you use some of it on that eye.I feel my neck heat up at Pats mention of kissing.Coach, if you only knew  Wes lifts a brow.Ice?Machine in the cafeteria broke down, so I need you to drive to the market and grab a dozen bags.Hes already dismissing us, turning to Georgie and Ken.Check the equipmentwe need the extra helmets and pads out of storage for any parents who want to scrimmage with us later.Wes and I head out while Pat is still playing drill sergeant.I slide into the passenger seat of his car, grinning at him as I remember last nights automotive adventures.He casts a rueful glance over his shoulder.I can never look at that backseat the same way again.Wait, youre saying you never hooked up in your car before yesterday?Nope.I had a single at Northern Mass, so I usually brought hook ups home.Or I went to their place.He pauses.That was the better option.Means I didnt have to kick em out when they wanted to spend the night.I furrow my brow.Youve never spent the night with anyone?He and I have been sleeping together regularly.Nope, he says again.Why not?Im suddenly curious to know about his love life.Not the sexthe idea of him with anyone else bugs the shit out of mebut the relationship stuff.For as long as Ive known him, Wes has been single.Now, knowing hes gay, it makes sense why he never had a girlfriend.But has he had a boyfriend?I didnt want anyone getting too attached to me, he says with a shrug, his eyes focused on the road.The response only makes me more curious.Did you ever get attached to them?Nope.This is his go to answer for the day, apparently.Have you ever gone out with anyone?I ask slowly.Hes quiet for a moment.No, he admits.I dont do boyfriends, Canning.Its too messy.For some reason, my gut clenches.I want to ask him what I am, then.An extended hook up?A summer fling?I knew this thing with us was bound to end eventually, but I at least thought the time weve had together has meant something to him.Because it means something to me.Im not sure what, or why, but I do know that this isnt just about sex for me.And once Im in Toronto, I wont be doing anything, he says glumly.Celibacy is gonna suck.An uneasy feeling washes over me.Did you talk to your dad about the Sports Illustrated thing?Havent told him yet.But Im not doing the interview.Thats not a can of worms Im interested in opening.He swiftly changes the subject, as he usually does when the conversation is too focused on him.What about you?Have you bought a ticket to Detroit yet?Great.He picks the one topic I dont want to discuss.No.Dude, you need to get on that.Wes parks in front of the supermarket and we hop out of the car.I hope hell drop the subject now that were here, but hes still talking about it as we walk into the air conditioned store.Youre supposed to report there in three weeks, he reminds me as he grabs a shopping cart.You thinking of renting a house in the suburbs?Where do the Detroit players tend to live?I nod, thinking about my conversation with Pat.He pulled me aside a couple days ago and said hed put some feelers out in the coaching community.Were supposed to talk again on Monday, but I still havent told Wes about it.Deciding to test the waters, I grab another cart and say, Honestly, Im not sure how I feel about going to Detroit.He looks startled.Meaning what?Meaning I take a breath.Screw it.Might as well tell him.We head for the freezers in the back, and Wes listens with no expression as I pretty much repeat everything I discussed with Hollyhow I dont want to play backup my entire career, my lack of enthusiasm about going to Detroit, the possibility of being sent to the minors and not even playing a pro game.The only part I leave out is that Im toying with taking a coaching job.Im not ready to talk about that yet, especially when nothing is even official.Once Im done, he still doesnt respond.He chews on his lips, thoughtful.Then he opens the freezer and heaves out a bag of ice.Youre really considering not playing this season?he finally says.Yeah.The cold air hits my face as I grab two more bags and load them into my cart.Do you think Im fucked in the head for throwing away a chance at the pros?Yes and no.He drops another bag in his cart.I think all your concerns are valid.The conversation halts when a woman pushing a cart pops around the corner.Her step stutters when she notices Wess black eye, and then she continues on with a wary look.Wes glances at me, chuckling.She thinks were hooligans.I roll my eyes.She thinks youre a hooligan.As she should.I, on the other hand, am a saint.He snorts.Should I flag her down and tell her how I got the shiner, Saint Jamie?I give him the finger, then grab two more bags.We push our carts side by side and wander over to the checkout counter, where we get in line behind an elderly couple with a shopping cart full of cereal boxes.Just cereal boxes and nothing else.So my concerns are valid, I prompt as we wait our turn.He nods.Goalies have it tough.I cant deny that.But?But this is your one chance.His voice softens.If you dont take it, you could regret it for the rest of your life.Look, if I was in your shoes, I might be questioning my decision too, but  No, you wouldnt.Youd report in a heartbeat, even if it meant spending years waiting for your shot.True dat.He rests his forearms on the cart.But thats because I love the game.Even if I get to play only five minutes in a whole season, its worth it to me.Hockey is everything to me.But is it everything to me?Im even more troubled as I think of all the hard work that goes into a professional hockey career.The constant training, the rigid diet, the grueling schedule.I love hockey, I really do, but Im not sure I love it as much as Wes loves it.And if I compare the level of satisfaction I get from stopping a goal to the pride I feel teaching someone like Mark Killfeather to become a better goalie, a better man I honestly dont know which one means more to me.I just think you need to give it a shot, Wes says, jolting me from my thoughts.At least go to training camp, Canning.What if youre there and suddenly theyre like, Were giving you the starting job, kid.Right, and then Ill fly to work on a Pegasus, befriend a genie, and get paid in leprechaun gold.Wes notices my expression and sighs.It could happen, he insists.Yeah, maybe, I say noncommittally.The old couple pushes their cereal cart away, and Wes and I step forward, charging the ice to Elites account.Five minutes later, were loading the bags into Wess trunk.Im no closer to reaching any sort of conclusions about my predicament, and Wes seems to sense that.He nods at the gas station fifty yards from the supermarket.Lets grab some slushies, he suggests.The icell melt if we leave it in the trunk for too long, I point out.He rolls his eyes.Itll take us all of five minutes.Besides, science has proven that slushies are conducive to the making of important life decisions.Dude, you really need to quit quoting science all the time.Laughing, we lock the car and make the short trek to the gas station, where Wes grabs two empty cups and nudges me toward the slushie station.He fills his cup with the cherry flavor and then waits.But I havent had a slushie in a long time, and I cant decide.So I put some of each flavor in my cup.At the counter, the middle aged clerk chuckles at the sight of my rainbow concoction.I did that once, he remarks.Felt sick for days afterward.Youve been warned, son.Wes snickers.My buddy likes a little bit of everything.I give him the side eye for that awful joke.We pay for our drinks and leave the store, but weve barely taken two steps when Wes slaps his forehead.We forgot the straws.Wait here.Ill grab em.As he ducks back inside, I linger near the door, admiring the sleek, silver Mercedes S class that pulls up to one of the pumps.A gray haired man gets out of the Merc and smooths the front of his silky tie.Shit, the guys rocking a suit that probably costs more than my parents make in a year.His gaze flicks in my direction.Are you the attendant?he barks out.I shake my head.Its self serve, I call back.Of course it is.His tone is condescending as fuck, and theres a sneer on his face as he twists off the cap of his gas tank.Frowning, I turn away from Snobby McSnobbers just as Wes pops out the door.He hands me a straw, his forehead wrinkling when he notices my expression.Clearly he thinks my frown is a result of my Detroit dilemma, because he lets out a quiet sigh.Youll figure it out, babe, he says softly.Youve still got time.Then he leans into me, gripping my shoulders with one arm.He brushes a reassuring kiss over my cheek, and my entire body tenses, because Snobby McSnobbers chooses that exact moment to glance our way.The look on the mans face cuts through me like a blade.Disgust.Pure, malicious disgust.Jesus.Nobody has ever looked at me that way before.Like Im a piece of dog shit theyve just had the misfortune of stepping on.Like they want to wipe my very existence off the face of the earth.Beside me, Wes stiffens.Hes just realized were being watched.No, that were being judged.Do you know that guy?he says warily.No.He looks familiar.Does he?Im too stuck on his expression to know.Ignore him, Wes murmurs, taking a step toward the car.My breathing is shaky as I follow him.Unless we walk all the way around the gas station to get back to our carwhich Im unbelievably tempted to do right nowwe have no choice but to pass the Mercedes.As we near the man in the suit, I find myself bracing myself the way I do on the ice right before a puck flies toward me.Im in defense mode, ready to protect myself at all costs, even though I know Im being ridiculous.This man isnt going attack me.He isnt going to  Fucking faggots, he mutters under his breath as we walk by.Those two words are like a blow to the gut.From the corner of my eye I see Wes flinch, but he doesnt say a word.He keeps walking, and I struggle to match his brisk stride.Im sorry, he says when we reach the car.Nothing to be sorry about, man.But I cant deny Im shaken up.That bubble Wes and I have been living in all summer has just burst.If we somehow managed to keep seeing each other after camp, I might encounter this type of shit all the time.Unbelievable.People are assholes.His tone is gentle as we get into the car.Not all of them, but some.My hand shakes as I place my slushie in the cup holder.This happens to you a lot?Not often.But it happens.He reaches for my hand, and I know he feels it trembling as he laces our fingers together.It sucks, Canning.Not saying it doesnt.But you cant let jerks like that get to you.Fuck em, right?I tighten my grip on his hand.Fuck em, I agree.Still, the drive back to the rink is subdued.We dont say much as we drop the ice off at the cafeteria.I really wish I could just brush off that bigoted commentthat lookbut it stays with me.Gnaws at me.Yet at the same time, I feel a burst of pride for Wes.No, its awe, because it takes true strength for him to be so unflinching about his sexuality.His own parents refuse to accept it, and even that doesnt keep him down.Coach Canning, Coach Wesley!Davies calls when Wes and I arrive outside the rink.Come meet my dad.The front steps are littered with teenagers and their folks, all of whom are eager to meet the coaches who are grooming their kids into champions.Shen is in the middle of an animated conversation with his parents, grinning wildly as he talks about his progress.A few feet away, Killfeather stands alone, his teeth worrying his bottom lip as he looks around.Wes and I have just reached Davies and his father when a flash of silver catches my peripheral vision.I shift my head, and my heart drops to the pit of my stomach when the Merc from the gas station suddenly speeds up to the curb.I notice Killfeather take a step forward, looking even more agitated now.The drivers door opens.The bigot gets out of the car and addresses Killfeather in an annoyed voice.Isnt there a closer parking lot?My goalie visibly gulps.No.Only the one behind the building.Ill leave the car here then.Its a fire lane, Killfeather protests.Just park in the lot, Dad.Please.Oh shit.Dad?Dread floods my stomach at the same time Killfeather Senior registers my presence.His head turns sharply, those dark eyes landing on me.Then on Wes.As his lips curl in an angry sneer, only one thought runs through my head.Fuck.29      Wes      Damn it.I knew that fucker at the gas station had looked familiar.I hold my breath as my gaze locks with the man at the curb.But Mr.Killfucker doesnt make me hold it for long.No fucking way, he spits.No fucking way.Where is Pat?Right here, says a calm voice.Pat appears in the open doorway, a frown playing on his lips.Is there a problem?Youre damn right there is.This is whats costing me thousands?Im paying a couple of perverts to spend hours each day with my kid?That is fucking bullshit.Heads are turning faster than on spectators at Wimbledon.And as I watch, Pats face pales.His eyes bounce onto me for a fraction of a second, and my heart sinks.Im going to be a liability here.A fucking crater for Pat and his business.Killfucker is also noticing all the other parental attention hes garnered.Thats when he goes in for the kill.I will not keep quiet about this.
