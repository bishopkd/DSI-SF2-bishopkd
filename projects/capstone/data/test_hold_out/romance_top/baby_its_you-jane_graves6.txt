Was she actually going to do that?Right here?Right now?Right in the middle of  Holy shit.She wrapped her hand around him.He took in a sharp, silent breath, his raging erection turning to solid rock.She slid her hand down its length all the way to the base, and then he felt her hot breath against the tip.Slowly she closed her lips around him.He dropped his head back against the wall with a harsh groan, gritting his teeth, his eyes squeezed closed.She licked and teased, then took him deeper into her mouth.He reached down to thread his fingers through that beautiful auburn hair, tightening them almost involuntarily against her scalp.Hed never felt anything like it in his life.Never.Never.He knew they should be inside.Behind closed doors.Only crazy people did things like this.But the truth was that he didnt care where they were.At that moment, all he knew was that her mouth was on him, moving in a way that was so hot, so carnal, so unbelievably perfect that he couldnt think about anything else.All he wanted was more.Then all at once he heard something.An engine.Soft at first, then louder.What the hell?A car.It was a car.And it was coming down the road from the front gate to the house.He froze, listening, waiting for the car to stop in front of the house and the engine to die.But it wasnt stopping.The engine noise grew louder.The car was coming all the way around the house to the garage.Kari, he said, barely able to speak.Kari!She looked up at him.He took her by the upper arms and pulled her to her feet.Somebodys here!Who?He yanked his pants up.I dont know.Your shirt!Grab it!My bra.I need to  Forget the bra, he said, buttoning his own shirt.Just put on your shirt!As Kari grabbed her T shirt and pulled it over her head, Marc fastened his jeans and buttoned his shirt.He ran a hand through his hair and scooted her bra around the back tire of his motorcycle with the toe of his boot just as the car wheeled around and parked in front of the garage.They stood there nonchalantly as a man got out of the car.In the darkness outside the barn, Marc couldnt make out who it was.Then he stepped into the light, and Marc almost groaned out loud.He was dressed in jeans, beat up sneakers, and a T shirt that read Professional Beta Tester.Give Me the Free Stuff.He looked back and forth between Marc and Kari, and the look of surprise on his face morphed into a broad, brilliant smile.Holy crap, Marc, he said.Angelas been at college only a week.Youre not wasting any time, are you?Daniel?Marc said.What the hell are you doing here?10    Kari was confused.Who was Daniel, and why was he smiling at the same time Marc looked slightly homicidal?What do you mean, what am I doing here?Daniel said.You knew I was coming.Youre a week early, Marc snapped.And here I thought youd be thrilled to see me.You should be at the house.What are you doing down here?The house was dark.I saw the light in the barn.Go away.Marc?Where are your manners?Shouldnt you introduce me?He strode over to Kari, holding out his hand.Hi.Im Daniel.Marcs brother.Now she remembered Nina mentioning his name, but she still had a hard time believing it.This congenial, gregarious man was Marcs brother?The family resemblance was there.They were both big men with the same build, but the intensity Marc exuded with every breath was totally absent in Daniel.He had dark, shaggy hair that brushed his collar in the back, a mouth that was clearly used to smiling, and eyes that sparkled with mischief.Kari shook his hand.Nice to meet you.Kari is staying in the cottage, Marc said.Just for a few weeks.Ah, Daniel said.She had some bad luck.Uh huh.So shes a little short on money.I see.We were justlooking at my motorcycle.That grin again.Oh, you were, were you?What are you doing here already?Marc said.Daniel shrugged.Missed you, dude.Couldnt wait to see you.Thats a load of crap.Im running from the law and need to hide out?Another load of crap.Im terminally ill and came home to die?Marc glared at him.Daniel leaned toward Kari and whispered, He didnt buy it.What do I do now?I dont know.She turned to Marc.What does he do now?He goes in the house, Marc said.Now.No problem, bro.Oh, by the waydid you know your shirts buttoned wrong?Marc looked down at himself, closing his eyes with frustration, then turned his gaze back up to glare at Daniel.Id point out a few other things wrong with this picture, such as your belt on the ground over there, but I dont think theyd be well received.But yall dont stop on my account, you hear?Go!Marc said.Daniel gave Marc one last grin and left the garage, heading up the path to the house.Im sorry, Marc said, once his brother was out of earshot.Daniel has a way of showing up unannounced.Kari inched closer, sliding her hand up Marcs chest.Well, he did say not to stop on his account  Marc closed his eyes, drooping with frustration.Okay, Kari said, dropping her hand to her side.I hear you.I guess the mood is kinda screwed up.Thanks to Daniel.How long has it been since youve seen him?A year and a half.Youd better go catch up.Marc let out a breath.I hate this, Kari.After the other night  Its okay.Tomorrows another day, right?But Kari wasnt completely sure of that.As soon as Marc left there, he might start being Marc again and thinking too logically about what was going on between them.He might go back to thinking it wasnt a good idea, and having his brother in the house would probably only compound the problem.But what else could she do but bow out for now?As Marc headed for the house, rebuttoning his shirt as he went, he was having a hell of a time walking.That was what happened when he was rock hard but was forced to fasten a pair of jeans.He was lucky hed even been able to button the damned things.Damn you, Daniel.Your timing sucks!As he walked to the house, he got a good look at the car Daniel had driven up in, and he felt an entirely different kind of frustration.It was a sports car.On closer inspection, a Porsche.Fire engine red, of course, because his brother didnt know cars came in any other color.Evidently hed gotten tired of the Corvette hed bought last year and decided to trade up.Marc came through the back door to find Daniel sitting at the kitchen table, leaning over to scratch Brandy as she writhed in ecstasy on the floor.Daniel was her hands down favorite family member, and no wonder.He sneaked her table scraps, let her jump all over him, and thought it was funny when she chewed on his shoes, which turned into her chewing on everybody elses shoes.After a visit from Daniel, it took Marc a week to get his well behaved dog back again.What a surprise, Marc said.You have a new car.Yep, Daniel said.A Porsche 911 Carrera.Sweet as can be.Zero to sixty in four point three seconds.When did you buy it?A week ago.Saw it in a dealership window and had to have it.How many tickets so far?Only two.Would have been three, but the third cop was a woman.She took one look at my handsome face and just couldnt do it.Daniel gave Brandy one last pat and sat up.Okay.My turn.When did you start stocking the cottage with beautiful women?Marc figured he could either tell the story now or have Daniel bug him about it for the next hour.Finally he just sat down and related the events of the past few days as matter of factly as he could, but that didnt stop his brother from acting as if the story was entertainment at its finest.Are you telling me a beautiful woman just showed up on your front porch out of the blue?Daniel said.Like a gift from God?No.If God was going to send me a woman, he would have sent a clean, dry one who didnt just leave her fianc at the altar.Who cares?Shes gorgeous.Marc hadnt missed how Daniel had flashed his too charming smile at Kari, then paid entirely too much attention to the clear outline of her braless breasts beneath her T shirt, and it grated on his nerves like nothing else.Hey, Im proud of you, Daniel went on.Youve had a No Admittance sign up for years.Its about time you unlocked the door.And look what was standing on the other side when you did.Will you stop talking about Kari?What goes on between us is our business.No problem.I have another woman on my mind, anyway.Marc slumped with dismay.Tell me youre not talking about Terri Vaughn.So you dont think shell be glad to see me?Glad to see you?Youll be lucky if she doesnt grab a shotgun and blow you away.After what happened last time you were at City Limits, you deserve it.Come on, Marc, Daniel said, rubbing his hands together.Lets go grab a beer.I love living dangerously.It had been a year and a half since Daniel had come back to the vineyard, giving Marc enough time to forget what his brother was like.A year and a half to forget, five minutes to remember.Fine, Marc said.But Im driving.And dont expect me to help you out.If bullets start flying, youre on your own.City Limits was a blue collar bar and grill located at the intersection of Highway 28 and the middle of nowhere, opened by Les Parker in the 1960s in response to Rainbow Valley liquor laws.The fact that it was inches outside the city limits gave the establishment its name and brought the wrath of the upstanding citizens of Rainbow Valley right down on Less head.Evidently back then, an evening of drinking and dancing condemned a person to hell for eternity.Decades later, Terri Vaughn bought the place and ran it in Less tradition, offering cold beer, hot barbecue, and an easygoing atmosphere that welcomed locals and tourists alike.Only a few citizens remained who believed a trip to City Limits excluded a person from walking through the Pearly Gates, but Marc was afraid the moment Daniel showed his face there again, Terri was going to personally send him up there to see if that rumor was true or not.The crowd was light as Marc and Daniel slid onto barstools.Terri was behind the bar, drawing a couple of frozen margaritas for customers.Her long blond hair was tied in a loose ponytail.She wore tight boot cut jeans slung low on her hips and a T shirt that hugged her breasts in a way that left nothing to the imagination.She moved with the authority of a woman who took no crap from anyone, but at the same time she wore the smile of a businesswoman who knew how to keep her customers happy.My God, Daniel said on a breath.Is it possible for her to be a year older and even hotter than the last time I saw her?Terri laughed at something one of her customers said, then turned around.The moment she laid eyes on Daniel, her smile vanished.She sauntered over with a stone faced, narrow eyed stare.Placing her palms on the bar, she leaned in and looked at Daniel as if he was dirt on the bottom of her boot.Daniel Cordero.I do believe I threw you out of here.I expected that to stick.Daniel assumed a properly chastised expression.Now, you know Im real sorry about what happened that night.And I did pay for the damages.Terri flicked her gaze to Marc, then looked back at Daniel.Heres the deal.Ill let you drink in my bar, but only because youre with Marc.But if you get out of line again, not even your brother will be able to save you.Enough about Marc, Daniel said.Lets talk about us.Terris glare sharpened.Im running a bar.Unless youre placing an order, you and I got nothing to talk about.Coors, Daniel said with a smile.And make sure its ice cold.Itd be a shame to warm up this frigid relationship weve got going.Terri turned to Marc.The usual?Yep.Coming up.A minute later, she set the drinks down, giving Daniel a stare that was even frostier than the beer.As she walked away, he tilted his head and followed every shift of her hips.Marc was surprised his tongue wasnt dragging on the ground.If she sees you looking at her like that, shell bust your balls, Marc said.Then shell bust the rest of you.Daniel sighed.Yeah, but what a way to go.What are you doing here a week early?Besides throwing a wet blanket over my brothers love life?Yeah, Marc deadpanned.Besides that.Daniel shrugged.Bad breakup.Figured Id move on before she put a contract out on me.What is it with you and women?Do you have to drive all of them to the brink of homicide?Any day Im still breathing I consider a good day.Hey, speaking of women, when is Angela coming home for a visit?Im sure shes dying to see her favorite uncle.Speaking of women?At age eighteen, Angela qualified.But would there ever come a day when Marc looked at her and didnt see a seven year old girl with a ragged, self inflicted pixie haircut and a missing front tooth?With luck, itll be a long time, Marc said.The longer she stays at school without coming home for a visit, the more comfortable Ill know she is.He paused.Im a little worried about her.UT is a big place.Shes not used to that.Shell be fine, particularly with the boys.Shes gorgeous.Theyre gonna love her.You said that just to piss me off, didnt you?Angela can take care of herself.You worry too much.Daniel took a sip of his beer.If youd let me pay for her college, at least you could stop worrying about that.I dont worry about that.Then it would be the only thing you dont worry about.Weve been through this.Its my responsibility, not yours.Well, Im getting ready to take all kinds of responsibility off your shoulders.Might as well throw that into the mix.Its handled.Its a drop in the bucket to me, Daniel said.Let me pay it.Then you never have to think about it again.Keep your money.Its easy to spend too much and then wish you hadnt.Are you saving?Might want to think about the future.Daniel frowned.Great.Here it comes again.Your rainy day speech.Christ, Marc.Im your brother, not your kid.I dont need your advice about every fucking thing.Marc wholeheartedly disagreed with that.He wanted to ask Daniel who he thought had raised him from the time he was thirteen years old.Who made sure that there was enough money put away for his college after their parents were gone, because he had a genius level IQ and it would have been a waste if he hadnt had the chance to go to college.Was it really so unreasonable for Marc to worry that even the incredible amount of money his brother had been able to make he would fritter away?If that happened, one more person would end up on Marcs list of people to worry about all over again.But since hed hoped for a whole evening to go by before he and Daniel got into it over something, he decided it was best to drop it.Daniel eyed Terri again, zeroing in on her ass as she bent over to pick up a stray straw off the ground.Then he looked back at Marc.Did I tell you I spent some time in Napa recently?No.You didnt mention that.Being a part owner of a vineyard is surprisingly good date bait.Right up there with being a millionaire?Nah.Money only gets you so far.But winethats romantic.I spouted all kinds of crap about vintages and appellations and color and clarity.Pour a woman a glass of wine and talk about mouth feel, and shes yours.Dad would be so proud.He taught you all about wine making so you could pick up women.Daniel looked heavenward.Thanks, Dad.Appreciate it.I dont suppose youve finally developed a taste for the stuff, have you?Oh, hell no, Daniel said.If I never see another glass of wine again, itll be too soon.Youve actually got a better palate than the rest of us.Like it or not, you know what youre tasting, and thats all that matters.Id probably know every nuance of Drano if I tasted it, too.Id just rather not.The irony was a little too much for Marc to handle.Hed never been able to discern the more subtle notes of a really good bottle of wine, while Daniel could describe every mouthful in excruciating detail.But its still bullshit, Daniel always said.Say anything with enough authority, and people will believe it.What were you doing in Napa?Marc asked.Daniel shrugged.Just poking around.Talking to a few guys.I have a couple of ideas about how we might be able to tweak the aging process.Marc felt a twinge of foreboding.Napas not the Hill Country.I know.But a lot of stuff still applies.Marc didnt know why he was surprised.This was nothing new.Daniel always thought he had a better way of doing things, because his brain was moving constantly.He always had the best of intentions, but the outcome was always in question.When you were working with intangibles like bits and bytes and something wasnt coming together, what did it hurt to throw out a million or so and start over?But grapevines were a real, physical product that couldnt withstand one bad decision after another without doing the kind of irreparable damage that would affect a vineyard for years to come.Daniel waved his hand.Forget about it for now.Well talk about it later.Lets have another beer.When he signaled Terri, she looked at Marc.He nodded, and she brought them another drink.Then Daniel glanced up at the baseball game playing on the TV over the bar, and they turned their conversation to the Rangers and their chances of heading to the World Series.Later Terri picked up their empty glasses and laid down the check.Marc grabbed it, only to have Daniel pluck it out of his hand and pay it with a credit card.Then as they were getting up to leave, he reached into his wallet, pulled out a hundred, and tossed it on the bar.Terri flicked her gaze to the extravagant tip, then reached over and picked it up.Hmm, she said, flipping it over and back with her fingertips.Looks like what they say is true.A fool and his money are soon parted.She slid it back across the bar.Theres your money back.But youre still a fool.As Terri walked away, Daniel shook his head with admiration.A woman who cant be bought.You dont see that every day.Then youve been hanging out with the wrong women.Its official.Im in love.You are so out of your league.Nah.Were both playing in the majors.Shes hot, Im hot.Wheres the problem?Thats it, Marc said.Were out of here.Kari sat on the sofa in the cottage watching some dumb TV sitcom, but her mind was on Marc.She was dying for him.Dying.A few minutes ago, shed looked out the window to see his truck parked near the garage, so she knew he and Daniel were home again.But when half an hour passed, then an hour, it was clear she wasnt going to see Marc again that night.She told herself it was because he hadnt seen Daniel in such a long time, that it had nothing to do with his logical brain kicking in again and telling him maybe they shouldnt be together.That was what she told herself, anyway, or she was going to go crazy.All at once, Boo jerked to attention and let out a flurry of barks.He leaped off the sofa and ran to the kitchen window.Curious, Kari followed him to the kitchen and looked out the window.Darkness had fallen, and a single mercury vapor light cast a weak glow over the area.At first she saw nothing and started to turn away, only to see a strange shadow several yards from the cottage.Then the shadow moved.Shocked, she stumbled backward several steps and stood there, breathing hard.A man was walking through the trees.A man she was sure wasnt supposed to be there.She hurried forward again and closed the blinds.After a few more seconds, she flipped one of the blinds up and looked out.The man had moved to a bank of trees closer to the cottage, and she had the distinct feeling she was being watched.She dropped the blind as if it was on fire.It couldnt be one of Marcs employees.It was late, and the trees surrounding the cottage were nowhere near the vines.And it looked as if this guy was trying to stay hidden.Every horror movie shed ever seen flashed through her mind.They always took place in out of the way locations just like this vineyard, which was miles from civilizationslasher movies with knives and scythes and chain saws.Boo barked again, but any evil person worth his salt knew that bark wasnt coming from a German shepherd or a pit bull.Just from one tiny dog who looked as if he should be trotting up the Yellow Brick Road.She ran to the front door and made sure it was locked.But what about the windows?She needed to make sure those were secured, too, but that meant she had to go near them, and she sure as hell didnt want to do that.Her phone.Where was her phone?There.She grabbed it off the end table in the living room.Calling 911 would do her no good out there.Thank God, Marc had given her his number.She punched the button, her heart beating madly.Waited through three rings.Kari?Marc, she whispered.Theres a man outside the cottage.What do you mean?At the door?No.Hes lurking in the trees, and hes moving closer.I thinkI think hes watching me.Any idea who it is?No.None.Is the door locked?Yes.Stay put.Im on my way.Kari laid down her phone, only to pick it up again as if it was a life preserver on the end of a rope.She waited in the living room, wondering if she should turn out the lights.Then wouldnt it be harder for her rapist/murderer to find her if he should happen to burst through the door?No.She couldnt sit in the dark.That would freak her out completely.Instead, she gathered up Boo and held him close to her chest, feeling his little heart beating like mad, hating the way he kept looking at that kitchen window.Then she heard what sounded like a car engine in the distance, and Boo let loose with another burst of barking.Then all at once she heard three loud raps.Kari!Answer the door.Kari!Oh, thank God.It was Marc.She put Boo down and leaped off the sofa.She hurried to the door, unlocked it, and flung it open.Marc and Daniel strode into the cottage, and they were both carrying rifles.Yes.Men with guns.She liked that.She liked that a lot.Are you all right?Marc asked her.Yeah.Im fine.You were right.There was definitely somebody out there.But by the time we got there, he was taking off through the trees.I thought I heard a car engine.You did, Daniel said.Theres a dirt road that runs along the western edge of the vineyard.Thats how he got away.Kari closed her eyes and took a deep breath.Scared the hell out of me.Who could it have been?I dont know, Marc said.Weve had our share of itinerant people wandering across our property, but they dont make getaways in cars.Kari swallowed hard.Why would somebody be poking around the cottage?A few houses and businesses in Rainbow Valley have been broken into in the past week, but I cant see burglars coming way out here.How about that fianc of yours?Ex fianc.And he wouldnt be walking through woods for any reason.The closest he gets to nature is when he hits a golf ball into the trees.So who do you think it was?I dont know.But until we find out, pack your things.Youre moving up to the house.Fifteen minutes later, Marc and Daniel had moved the last of Karis suitcases to the house.It felt odd being there, particularly with Daniel knowing what was going on between her and Marc.But her alternative was to stay in the cottage, never knowing when the scary man would come lumbering back through the forest, this time with his trusty chain saw.Much better to be in the big house with big locks and big men with firearms.With Daniel in the guest room, Marc said the only other room available was Angelas, so he put Kari in there.As he gathered her suitcases in one corner, she circled her gaze around the room.As weird as it felt being in the house, it felt even weirder being in a teenage girls room, even though Angelas was different than she imagined most would be.The furniture looked antique, with a vintage handmade quilt on the bed.Where rock star posters should have been were posters of horses and other animals.I take it your daughter is an animal lover?Kari asked.She wants to be a vet.She used to work at the Rainbow Valley Animal Shelter in the summer and on weekends during the school year.Yeah, I met Shannon North the other day.Nina introduced us at Rosies.Shannon was good to Angela, Marc said.Wrote one of her college recommendation letters.Boo walked over to Marc and barked.What does he want?Marc asked.Nothing.Then why is he barking?I dont know.Doesnt Brandy ever bark for no reason?Nope.Marc had a dog with as much self control as he did.What a surprise.Try to keep him from chewing something up while hes here, will you?Marc said.Kari put her fists on her hips.What makes you think hell chew something up?The teeth marks on the dining room chair in the cottage.She dropped her hands to her side.Oh.Bathrooms in there.The bed should still be made up.Anything else you need?No.Are you sure?Im sure.Good.In one smooth move, Marc kicked the door shut with the heel of his boot, grabbed Kari around the waist, and pulled her up next to him, giving her a look so hot it practically melted her panties.I believe we have some unfinished business.11    When Marc slid his hand along Karis neck, pulled her to him, and kissed her, she thought she must have fallen into some kind of dreamworld where fondest wishes come true.She loved how he slipped his tongue into her mouth and stroked it against hers.She loved the way his hand tightened against his neck as he kissed her.She loved the way he smelled, clean and masculine, like a big, brawny man who lived life outdoors.When she started to get a little light headed, she ripped her mouth away for a quick intake of air, as if she was a drowning woman whod lifted her head above the surface, only to lock lips with him again and succumb to the delicious drowning sensation one more time.He backed off, grabbed the tail of her T shirt, and yanked it over her head.They both went after his shirt buttons, and once his shirt was off, he pulled her up next to him again, crushing her bare breasts against his chest, kissing his way along her neck as he stroked her thigh.She slid her hand down to his crotch, where she felt his hard on bulging beneath his jeans.When you didnt come down to the cottage, she said, breathing hard, I thought maybe youd decided we shouldnt do this.Oh, hell no.Does the door have a lock?Dont need one.Daniel  If he comes in here, hes a dead man.Then Ill kick his body into the hall and keep on going.She smiled.I dont think Ive ever had a man offer to commit fratricide for me.Another one of those big words?It means  I know what it means.It means nothing is stopping us this time.He turned around, gave the gorgeous handmade quilt on the bed a hard yank, and slung it to the floor.Then he reached into his pocket, pulled out three condoms, and tossed them on the bed.She looked at them with surprise.When did you grab those?Earlier.I wasnt going to get caught without one again.I take it theyre not expired.Like I said.Nothings stopping us this time.Marc laid her down on the bed and yanked off her jeans, leaving her wearing nothing but her purple satin panties with the pink hearts on them shed gotten on sale at Victorias Secret.As much as I love these, they gotta go, he said, pulling them off.You love my panties?You have no idea.But right now they look better on the floor.He tossed those aside, too, then he turned back to look at her.My God, youre gorgeous.I am?Believe it.Every word he spoke seemed to be drenched in lust, and it turned her on like nothing else.He was out of his jeans in no time, barely kicking them aside before he was stretched out beside her on the bed.He teased his fingertip across her nipple, and then his mouth was on her, and she arched her back and maybe even whimpered a little because she wanted more.More, more, more.She closed her hand around his cock and stroked him.She was hot and swollen and dying to feel him inside her, and when he finally moved between her legs, she thought shed die from the anticipation she felt.He slid his hand beneath her ass and plunged inside her with a harsh groan.She arched up against him because it felt so good.He moved harder and faster, and she had the most glorious sensation of him filling her completely, moving in and out, the friction causing red hot sensations to streak through her, every new one building on the last, every stroke pushing her higher and higher.Then she felt it.A tiny spark that became a blazing inferno in five seconds flat.And then she was cominga hot, indescribable sensation that rolled over her like surf crashing against a shoreline.He moved like a man possessed, and she loved it.Loved it.Seconds later, Marc buried his face in her neck, his hot breath scorching her skin.Oh, GodKariyes  A raspy sound of pleasure radiated from deep in his throat, and he quivered beneath her hands.He craved discipline and self control more than any man shed ever met, so when he lost control like this, she felt like the most powerful woman in the world.A minute later they lay together, their breathing slowly returning to normal.When she thought about how shed almost married a man who didnt make her feel one tenth as good as she felt right now, she almost cried.She told herself that when the inevitable happened and Marc got on that motorcycle and drove away, at least shed know what sex was supposed to feel like.He lay on his back, his eyes closed, a sheen of sweat along his forehead.When he finally turned to look at her, his dark eyes were filled with satisfaction.Our bargain is working out pretty well, Marc said.Bargain?Kari thought.What bargain?And then she remembered.Their bargain.Just sex.No commitment.Fun and games.And when it was over  Yep, Kari said, suddenly feeling not so great about that.So far, so good.We decided on just sex, Marc said.The question is, how much sex?I dont know, she said with a teasing smile.How much do you want?He pulled her into his arms again, and by the look in his eyes, he actually meant to see how much they could accomplish in a single night.A warning flashed inside her head.Hes leaving soon.Stop now, or youll be sorry.Uh huh.Right.That was going to happen.Shed been hot for Marc almost from the first moment she met him.Now he wanted to have as much sex with her as they both could stand, and she was going to say no?When Kari rose the next morning, it was after ten.She lay in bed for a moment, thinking about the night before, and took a deep breath of pure delight.Then she took another one to welcome her first whole day off since shed started working at Rosies.Hallelujah.Marc was up and gone already, so she took a shower, got dressed, and headed downstairs.She found Daniel in the kitchen wearing a pair of plaid boxer shorts and a T shirt that said I Havent Lost My Mind.Its Backed Up Somewhere.His smushed up hair and day old beard told her he probably hadnt hauled himself out of the sack much before she had.He was sitting at the table with a cup of coffee and a two pack of cold Pop Tarts, poking away at his phone.Hey, Kari.Coffees over there.She turned to see Sasha sitting on the kitchen countertop next to the coffeemaker, her tail curled around her legs, gazing around as if she owned the place.Kari gave her a few strokes along her back.The cat arched up into her hand, then sat back down again.Im surprised Marc lets Sasha on the countertop, Kari said.He doesnt.She knows what she can get away with.So she doesnt sit up there when Marcs around?Nope.But Uncle Daniel makes it a point to spoil all living things in the Cordero household.A tiny smile curled his mouth.Drives Marc nuts.Kari poured a cup of coffee and sat down at the table.Daniel shoved the last of one of the Pop Tarts into his mouth and slid the other one toward her.Go ahead.Ones my limit on cardboard and rubber fruit.Kari grabbed the Pop Tart and nibbled on it.Wheres Marc?Where he always is this time of morning.Giving each grape a little kiss.Takes him a while, but he swears they grow better.He tossed his phone to the table.Shit.Wi Fi sucks in this house.I gotta do something about that.I couldnt help but notice that you drive an extremely cool car, Kari said.What do you do to afford a Porsche like that one?If you dont mind my asking.Now, why would I mind a woman asking that?Gives me a chance to tell her Im filthy rich.How filthy?That Porsche was a hundred grand, and I didnt even bother to talk the guy down.If you ever want to get behind the wheel and take it for a spin, let me know.Seriously?Didnt you hear the story of how I ended up here in the first place?Honey, thats what insurance is for.Ive been driving one of Marcs cars.One of his cars?The Bomb.Daniel looked horrified.Hes got you driving that piece of shit?Beats walking.So where did you make your money?Developed a little website creation app for small businesses.Google wants to rule the world, so they bought me out.They didnt want to do anything with it.They just wanted to make sure Id never end up being competition.To them, I was peanuts, but Ill never have to work another day as long as I live.And now here I am, Mr.Cosmopolitan, coming back to Rainbow Valley, Texas, to run an estate vineyard.Now, tell me, Kari.Where along the way did I lose my mind?I dont know.I kind of like it here.Its peaceful.You dont strike me as a peaceful kind of girl.You had Marc half naked in the garage.I couldnt imagine any woman on earth who would have been able to pull that off.Maybe hes crazier than you think.Nope.Not my brother.The devil clearly made him do it.Kari smiled.So Im the devil?God, I hope so.Somebody needs to get Marc to loosen up.Thats his plan, isnt it?Once he leaves the vineyard and you take over?Yep.That was the deal we made when Angela was about fourteen.Three years.Then either he comes back to run the place again, or we sell it and split the profits.Im paroled either way, so I dont care.Which do you figure its going to be?Guess it all depends on whether he finds a better deal out there somewhere.Kari had a flash of that better deal being a woman, and she didnt like it.So whats your take on why hes leaving?Kari asked.Freedom, baby.The open road.No strings, no commitments.He wants to dump responsibility and head out.Then Daniel shrugged.Actually, Id hoped it was just Angelas teenage girl crap that made him want to leave, and hed get over it once she grew up and became a human being again.No such luck.So here I am, holding up my end of the bargain.So how do you feel about running the vineyard?Daniel picked up his phone again.That was the deal we made.So he didnt exactly feel great about it.Truth be told, Kari could see why.Daniel seemed about as suited to running a vineyard as Marc did to becoming a dot com millionaire.She didnt think shed ever seen two brothers more different from each other in her life.Thanks for the yummy breakfast, she said, tossing the Pop Tart wrapper in the trash.I think Ill go watch Marc kiss a few grapes.Kari went outside and was met by a warm morning sun and a bright, cloudless sky.She saw Marc with Ramon and wandered over.Oddly, they werent looking at any of the vines.Instead they were examining a rosebush.Closer now, Kari could see there was one planted at the end of every row of vines.Good morning, she said.When Marc looked up, she was pleased to see his eyes flick to her breasts, her legs, and back up again.Then a tiny smile crossed his lips.Good morning.Ramon nodded a greeting, then clipped a branch off the rosebush the two men were looking at.Ill check it out, he said as he walked away.Whats with the rosebushes?Kari asked.Have you heard about canaries in coal mines?Sure.The canaries are way more sensitive than the miners, so if the canary faints, it means theres less oxygen in the mine and the miners need to watch out.Exactly.The rosebushes are more delicate than the vines.If they show mold or pest infestation or signs of drought, it means wed better pay close attention to the vines, because sooner or later those things will be a problem for them, too.Ramon took a clipping that looked a little suspicious back to the lab.Marc pulled his phone from his pocket and poked at it for a moment.He looked up at the sky, then poked again.You cant seem to keep your hands off your phone, Kari said.So what are you hooked on?Facebook?Cat videos?Porn?Weather.Weather?She looked over at his phone and was stunned.Good Lord.How many weather apps do you have?I dont know.Six?Thats an obsession Ive never heard of.Our business depends on the weather.You know that rainstorm we had the night you ran off the road?Were just lucky theres time before harvest for the grapes to recover from that.Recover?I thought rain was good for growing things.Some rain.But not too much.But you have all these sloping hills.Doesnt the water just run off?With grapes, water isnt taken in just through the roots.It goes through the grape skins, too.Too much water, and the grapes split.If the skins have already been compromised by bugs or birds or mold, it makes it that much easier for the water to damage them.If theyre not ready to be harvested, they rot on the vine.I didnt know grapes were that delicate.Believe me, grapes can be a real pain in the ass.If you dont pick them at exactly the right time, the acidity can be off.They need a certain amount of sugar to ferment properly.We picked the grapes just in time last year, right before a huge rainstorm that went from late one afternoon until before dawn the next day.If those grapes had still been on the vine, the water would have bloated them and thrown their chemical composition off.A whole crop can be ruined that way.Fortunately, we had the crew booked and they got the job done in time.I always figured you just pulled the grapes off the vines, squeezed out the juice, and that was that.I wish it were that simple.I didnt realize you were at the mercy of the weather like that.She shook her head.Wine making is a tough business, isnt it?Why do you think Im ready to leave it all to Daniel for a while?Kari could see why.What she couldnt see was Daniel actually running the place.Daniel said you kiss all the grapes every morning to make them grow better.Daniels a smart ass.So whens he taking the helm?Im scheduling the crew, but I want him to call the shots during harvest this year.So you can make sure hes doing it right before you go?Exactly.Kari could see why Marc would want out from under all that work and worry.But shed also seen the way he stood on his back deck and looked out over the vineyard as the sun was setting.It was a look of pride unlike anything shed seen before.How could he want to leave something hed spent so much of his life perfecting?Kari left Marc working in the vineyard and went back to the house, where she spent most of the day in the den with her Kindle.She read one of the fifty or so books shed already downloaded at the same time she provided her lap as a place for Boo to take a nap.Later she made dinner for Marc and Daniel because she figured she should do something to pull her own weight.She found the ingredients for spaghetti and salad in the kitchen, which wasnt all that great a meal, but Marc said anything he didnt have to cook himself tasted like five star cuisine.After dinner they all went into the den and watched some intensely masculine spy movie that Daniel and Marc seemed tremendously interested in but Kari couldnt have cared less about.What she did care about was how Marcs hand wandered over to her thigh, where it stayed for the majority of the movie.He moved his thumb back and forth in a slow, mesmerizing motion that made her think of sex with him all over again.At one point, Daniel paused the movie and went to get beer for all of them.Kari asked Marc if hed talked to the sheriff about the prowler the other night.Marc said the sheriff had no idea who it might have been, and that had been the end of it.She let out a silent sigh of relief.Yeah, she wanted to know who was hanging around who shouldnt have been, but she was also glad that Marc seemed to be in no real hurry to get to the bottom of things so he could send her back to the cottage.When the movie was over, he led her to his bedroom, which was oozing with the same masculinity he was, complete with a huge, rough hewn four poster bed, a massive dresser, heavy linens, western prints on the walls, and a black iron chandelier in the center of the high ceiling.Just sweeping her gaze from one side of the room to the other made her heart beat faster.Then he introduced her to that king sized bed, and her heart rate went through the roof.Later, when they finally settled down to sleep, Marc pulled her into his arms with her head resting on his shoulder.As she listened to his rhythmic breathing and felt the warmth of his body radiating to hers, Kari could honestly say shed never felt so content in her life.The next morning when Kari parked the Bomb and went into the caf, she greeted the other waitresses with a smile on her face and a song in her heart.She felt as if one of those Disney bluebirds had flown through the window and landed on her shoulder.Even Bobbie couldnt screw up her good mood today.She remembered what Nina had said.Just have fun with it.And that was exactly what she intended to do.During the breakfast rush, Kari made a concerted effort to keep that smile on her face, and by the time lunch rolled around, she was starting to feel as if she truly was getting into the swing of things.Marla seated a family of four in her sectionMom, Dad, and a pair of towheaded twins about six years old, and she decided to put Ninas suggestion into action.Mom ordered a fried chicken salad, and Dad went for the brisket sandwich.The boys ordered hamburgers.Kari wrote it down, then leaned in to talk to the kids.If I tell you something, she said in a stage whisper, will you promise not to tell your parents?Both the boys eyes grew wide.Im new here, so I mess up a lot.If you order a hamburger, theres no telling what I might bring you instead.She leaned in closer.What if I really messed up and brought you something awful?Like what?one of the boys said.Likea zombie.Both boys eyebrows flew up.A zombie?If I brought you one of those, would you eat it?One of them grinned.Id eat it!So would I!the other one said.Even if it tried to eat you first?Kari said.The boys giggled.Wed eat it before it could eat us!Im just warning you, Kari said dramatically, looking over her shoulder with trepidation.That kitchen is a scary place.No telling what might end up on your plate!One of the boys turned to his mother.We get to eat zombies!The mother smiled at Kari.She winked furtively and headed to the kitchen to put in the order.Carlos?she said.Will you do me a favor?Anything for you, seorita, he said.I need a couple of naked burgers.Buns and meat only.Carlos complied, and she stepped to the grill side of the kitchen beside him.She grabbed pickles and put them on the open faced burgers for eyeballs.Shredded lettuce became hair, and she created the rest of the face with a mustard squirter, adding ketchup blood to make it look as disgusting as possible.Bobbie walked over and looked over her shoulder.What the hell is that?Kari smiled.Just flirting with the male customers.Youre so weird, Bobbie said and flounced off with a couple of orders of nachos.Anything else for burgers?Carlos asked.Nope.Thisll do.She smiled.You know, you speak amazingly good English.Sometimes good, he said with a smile, then glanced at Bobbie leaving the kitchen and frowned.Sometimes not so good.Kari returned to the table with lunch for Mom and Dad, and then she set the baskets down in front of the boys.Zombies!they said.What?Kari said, fluttering her hand against her chest and looking horrified.Oh, no!I just knew I was going to mess up the order!Im so sorry!One of the boys took the top bun and squashed it down on the rest of the burger.There.I killed it!The other boy did the same, and then they both picked up their burgers and gnawed into them, giggling the whole time.And Mom and Dad couldnt stop smiling.When Kari brought the check, she drew an oozing zombie on it with frightful hair.Dad showed the boys, who laughed all over again.The parents thanked her on their way out the door.She took the credit slip from Marla, looked at the tip, and just about fell over backward.She did some quick math in her head.Twenty five percent?For the rest of her shift, Kari felt as if shed found the key to the mint.Bobbie hated kids, she loved them.This was perfect.She found out little boys liked zombies.Little girls liked puppies and kittens.It was amazing the creatures she could create with just about anything on the kids menu.And parents liked anything that kept their kids happy, smiling, and still in their seats.Nina had been right.Once she started having fun with it, everything seemed to change, and the day flew by.So howd it go today, girls?Bobbie said at the end of their shift.Kari usually hated the sound of those words.But when she added up her tips, she almost gasped out loud.Shed made a buck more than Bobbie.It was only a single dollar, but it seemed like a million.When Kari reported the amount, Bobbies face went stark white.Well, Bobbie said, suddenly sounding a little shaky.Its because you waited on a party of eight this morning.Youre right, Kari said.It was probably just a fluke.Of course it was a fluke.I know, Kari agreed.It couldnt possibly happen again.Bobbie got a calculating look on her face.I guess well find out tomorrow, wont we?Kari felt a rush of total exhilaration, and for the first time she was actually looking forward to her next shift.As she was leaving the caf a few minutes later, Rosie called out to her.Kari.I forgot to give this to you earlier.Nina dropped it by this morning.Rosie handed her a paper gift bag.Kari peeked inside, surprised to find a bottle of vanilla scented lotion, a nail file and a couple of bottles of polish, facial moisturizer, shower gel, and several other personal care items Kari hadnt packed for her trip to Bali and was dying to have.Then she saw a note card.Thought you might need some girlie stuff, it said.And it was signed Nina.A whole herd of warm fuzzies gathered in Karis stomach.She barely knew Nina, yet shed done this for her?Instead of heading back to the cottage, Kari made her way down the square to the Cordero wineshop.She opened the door, and bells clinked against the glass.It was a beautiful shop, with rough sawn wooden racks full of wine from floor to ceiling.The walls were painted a dark, rich burgundy with hand painted grapevines meandering along them.High on one wall was a sign encouraging people to adopt pets from the Rainbow Valley Animal Shelter.A pair of tabby cats lay on a corner bookshelf in a sleepy tangle of paws and heads and tails.A young couple with a little brown mutt on a leash were picking out a bottle of wine.A woman came out of the back room with a name tag that read Bonnie.She was a short, stout, forty something woman whose instantaneous smile made it impossible for Kari not to smile back.Hi, Kari said.Im looking for Nina.You just missed her.Business has been slow this afternoon, so she and Manfred took a walk down to the Overlook.The woman stuck out her hand.Hi, Im Bonnie.You must be Kari.Kari was surprised.How did you know who I was?You fit Ninas description.Hard to miss that gorgeous red hair.Ive never been to the Overlook.Maybe Ill just go down there and talk to her.Its down the street on Rainbow Way, right?Two blocks, Bonnie said.When you reach the sign, hang a left down the brick path.Kari left the shop, put the bag Nina had given her into the Bomb, then made her way across the square toward Rainbow Way.She walked past the Book Tree, where she stopped for a moment to look at a window display of Texas themed coffee table books.A few doors down, she walked past Tashas Hair Boutique.When Kari was in college, shed had a very cool pink streak in her hair, which had replaced the purple, which had replaced the blue.When shed graduated and gone to work for her father at his company, of course that kind of personal expression hadnt been acceptable.Shed been keeping her hair under wraps ever since.
