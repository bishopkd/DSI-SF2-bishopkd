She shakes her head.Youll be signing a one year lease.Youre guaranteed the place until the lease is up.Fuck it.Ill take it, I tell her.Because honestly?Im tired of apartment hunting.I just need a place to sleep.Doesnt matter where.Either way, my heart wont be in it.My heart is back in Lake Placid.Or maybe its in California.It goes wherever Jamie Canning goes.I feel like such a shit for walking out on him like that.But Ive never been good with goodbyes.Which just proves Im as immature and thoughtless now as I was four years ago.I cut him out of my life back then too.I guess thats my thing.I really am an asshole.Oblivious to my self hatred, party of one, the realtors face lights up.Wonderful.Ill draw up the paperwork this evening.Five minutes later, I step out of the glass lobby onto the sidewalk, breathing in the warm July air.Theres a streetcar stop a block away, so I shove my hands in my pockets and head toward it.I just want to get back to my hotel and spend the rest of the day doing nothing, but as I climb onto the streetcar, I decide against that.I cant keep wallowing in misery.Canning and I are over.And in a few days, Ill be immersed in training, which wont leave me much time to explore my new home.I grab a late lunch at a small caf overlooking the lake, then wander around for a bit, slightly amazed by my surroundings.The streets are so clean, and the people are so damn polite.I cant even count how many times I hear the words excuse me and sorry and thanks so much in the two hours I spend exploring.Eventually I go back to the hotel, where I take a quick shower before tackling the next item on the days to do list.Email agentcheck.Find apartmentcheck.Next up is a phone call to my father.Gee.Cant wait.I dial my home number, then sit at the edge of the bed, already dreading hearing the sound of his voice.But my mom is the one who picks up the phone.Ryan, how nice to hear from you, she says in her crisp, emotionless tone.Yeah, Im sure shes thrilled.Hi, Mom.Hows everything in Boston?Its lovely.I just walked through the door, actually.I was meeting with the historical society tonight.Were talking with the city about restoring the old library on Washington.Sounds fun.As if.Is Dad around?Yes.Let me ring him on the intercom for you.Yup, our house in Beacon Hill has intercoms in every room, because thats how rich people roll.Who has time to walk into another room and hand someone a phone when theyre so busy counting their piles of money?My father comes on the line a moment later, greeting me coolly.What is it, Ryan?Hello to you too, Dad.Hey.I just wanted to talk to you about the Sports Illustrated interview.He immediately goes on guard.What about it?Im not going to do it.I pause.When he doesnt respond, I hurry on.Rookie seasons are too unpredictable, Dad.I see.His tone is clipped.And this has nothing to do with you wanting to hide youractivitiesfrom the magazine?Its not about that, I insist.I cant have a reporter following me around for a whole year, especially if that year ends up being a bust.I clench my teeth.As for my activities, you dont have to worry about that.As of this moment, its a non issue.I see, he says again.Then it was a phase.He sounds smug.Yes, Dad.My sexuality is a phase.Who I am, to my very core, is a phase.Bitterness clogs my throat, threatening to choke me alive.I cant deal with him right now.Or ever.But especially right now.Anyway, I appreciate the opportunity, but the interview wont be happening.Please thank your friend for me.I hang up without saying goodbye, then bolt to my feet, resisting the urge to hit something.Am I a bad person for hating my parents?No, for loathing them?Sometimes I feel like Im going straight to hell for the thoughts I harbor.Biting the inside of my cheek, I glance around the suite.I guess I can watch some TV.Order room service.Do something to distract myself from thinking about Jamie or my parents or my fucked up life.But it feels like the walls are closing in on me.I need to get out of this room.I need to get out of my head.I grab my wallet and keycard, tuck them in my pocket, and hightail it out of the hotel.Once Im on the sidewalk, I falter, because I honestly dont know where the hell Im going.I consider ducking into the bar across the street for a drink, but Im scared I wont stop at one.My first night in Toronto, I got blackout drunk, alternating between kneeling over the toilet puking my guts out, and curling up on my bed missing Jamie.I refuse to make that a habit.I start walking.Its eight oclock on a weekday, so stores are still open and the sidewalks are crowded.Nothing or no one catches my interest, though.So I keep walking.And then I walk some more, until the neon sign of a storefront in the distance snags my attention.The tattoo parlor beckons me like a light at the end of a tunnel.I find myself walking toward it without really thinking about it, and suddenly Im in front of the door.Ive been considering getting this done for a while now, but it felt too cheesy.Now, it feels bittersweet.And fitting.I hesitate for a beat, then study the store hours posted next to the door.The shops closing at nine.Its eight twenty now.Chances are, it wont be enough time for the artist to see me, but Im nothing if not impulsive.A bell rings over the door as I stride inside and approach the longhaired guy behind the counter.Hes in a black wife beater, leaning back in a swivel chair with a magazine in his lap.His neck, arms and shoulders are covered in ink.Hey, he says easily.How can I help you?Do you take walk ins?I ask.Yep, but it depends on what youre getting done.Bigger pieces require multiple sittings.He gazes at the tats peeking out of my sleeves.But you probably already knew that.I look around, examining the photos plastered all over the walls.There are some incredible pieces up there.Did you do all these?Damn right I did.He grins.Are you looking for a custom piece?No, just something simple.I hold up my right wrist.One line of text here.I can do that for you no problem.He rises from his chair and sets the magazine aside, then talks prices with me.Its affordable, and I feel an instant trust toward the guy, so when he says, Why dont you come on back?I follow him without any further questions.He leads me through a dark curtain into a workspace thats clean and uncluttered.Thats a good sign.Im Vin, he says.I arch a brow.Is your last name Diesel?He snickers.Nope.Its Romano.Vins short for Vincenzo.My familys Italian.Im Wes.We shake hands, and then he gestures to the chair.Have a seat.After I sit down, he rolls up his sleeves and asks, So what text do you want inked?I reach into my pocket for my phone, tapping on the screen to pull up the note Id left in my notepad app.I find it, then hand him the phone.Those numbers exactly.He studies the screen.You want it as numerals or spelled out?Numerals.How big?Half an inch maybe?Nodding, Vin grabs a sketchpad and scribbles down the numbers before handing the phone back.His pencil flies across the pad as he sketches something.A moment later, he holds up the page.Something like this, maybe?I nod.Perfect.Youre easy to please.With a grin, he quickly bustles around to prepare his station, grabbing supplies from a nearby cupboard while I scrutinize his every move.Im pleased to see that the medical grade needle he brings over is packaged, which means this shop is disposing of the needles after every use.Vin settles in front of me.He snaps on a pair of latex gloves, takes the needle out of its packaging, then reaches for the tattoo gun.So where is it?he asks.I wrinkle my forehead.Wheres what?He swipes disinfectant over the inside of my right wrist.Those numberstheyre longitude and latitude, right?Coordinates?Where would I wind up on the map if I looked them up?Lake Placid, I say gruffly.Huh.He looks intrigued.Why Lake Placid?And feel free to tell me to mind my own business, if you want.I swallow.No, its fine.The place means a lot to me, thats all.I spent the best summers of my life there.Vin pours black ink into one of the plastic cups on the tray in front of him.I hate the summer.I cant help but grin.Youd think someone who deals with the frigid Canadian winter for half the year would welcome the hot weather.Whys that?Because it always ends.He lets out a glum sigh.We get, what, two, three months?And then its gone and were back to shivering in our long johns.Summers a total cocktease.He shrugs, repeating himself.It always ends.Hes right about that.Summer always ends.36      Jamie      I am nailing this interview.Thats not me being cockyits just the truth.My potential boss, Bill Braddock, is about forty years old, and a good guy, too.I can tell already.Weve just spent forty minutes nerding out about the best methods for training forwards to be more responsible defensively.When Bill talks strategy, his eyes light up.I want this job.I really do.Sorry, Bill says.I got us off track again.Thats quite all right, I answer.This is the crux of it, right?Teaching kids to relax so they can defend their zone effectively.He nods enthusiastically.How did you learn to be so calm, anyway?Ive seen your tape.Ah.I chuckle.Im the youngest of six kids.I was born into mayhem.Its all I know.Ive got Braddock laughing now.He actually slaps his own knee.Priceless.Was it ever a drag?Sure.When you have six kids, youre always losing one.And when youre the youngest, its usually you.I remember standing in the cereal aisle of the grocery store, trying to decide between Cheerios and Chex.Id look up and everyone would be gone.Once they left me at a rest stop outside Lake Tahoe.At least they only got fifteen miles away before they realized I wasnt in the car.Bill is red faced from laughing.How old were you?Seven?Eight?I dont know.But I knew not to panic.Incredible.He chuckles, then reaches a hand across the desk.Come to work for me, Jamie.I think well get along great.I lean in for the handshake.Id like to do that.Its a big decision, you can take the weekend  Now I shake my head.I want to coach.I dont need the weekend.He sits back, his expression telling me hes impressed.Well, all right then.Can I hook you up with a rental agency?Housing is going to be a little tricky.Toronto is expensive.We pay our coaches what we can, but nobodys getting rich  Yeah, Im going to need to sort that out.For the first time in an hour, I think of Wes.He might be only a few miles away right now, looking for an apartment, too.I need to speak to himIve already decided that.But then Ill have to find a way to put him out of my mind.I dont want to always be looking for his face when I walk down the street.Moving on is going to be hard.I stand up and offer my hand one more time.Bill shakes it, still smiling as if hes just won the lottery.At least Ill be working for a good man.Im hoping that means good things about this organization, too.Let me know how I can help you get settled in, Bill says, rising from his chair.I mean it.Shoot me an email if you have any questions about neighborhoods or whatever.Ill do that.Five minutes later, Im outside again on the streets of Toronto, loosening the tie Id worn to my interview.I missed lunch today, so I take a seat at an outdoor cafe on Lakeshore and order a wrap sandwich and iced coffee.Toronto is a nice place.A big city, too.Somehow I have to find Wes today.I tried calling him this morning after I got off the plane, but his number has been disconnected.At first Id panicked, thinking hed gone to great lengths to shut me out.But when my phone carrier sent me a text explaining the international charges I was racking up in Canada, I realized Wes had probably switched to a Canadian carrier.That has to be it, right?Either way, I need another plan for reaching him quickly.I could go to the rink, but I doubt theyll let me just waltz in.And even if they do, Wes might not appreciate it  My phone rings, startling me, and for a second my heart leaps.But of course the caller isnt Wes.The phone says HOLLY.Hi there, I answer, trying to keep my tone light.We havent spoken since our awkward evening in Lake Placid, but Im really hoping she meant what she said about us still being friends.Youll never guess where I am right now.She laughs, and the sound is comforting.Not Detroit, then?Nope.Toronto.Im taking a coaching job.Really?Thats great, Jamie.Im so proud of you.Glad you went with your gut.My heart swells a little.Everyone likes to hear theyve done well.Thanks.Its going to be an adjustment.Canadian money is funny looking.Holly giggles.Why Toronto?Are you going to tell me about your mystery woman?Um Ouch.Not sure if thats going to work out.And Im not too happy about it.Oh honey.Theres genuine sympathy in her voice.Im sorry.Why not?The waitress drops off my food, and I take a moment to thank her.So, I say, glancing over my shoulder.Im alone and outside, which is why I answered my phone in the first place.Heres something that will crack you right up.I need to tell someone.And Holly will keep my secret.Shes a good friend.What?My mystery woman?There isnt one.I was seeing a guy.There is deep silence for a moment.Really?She sounds incredulous.Really.Apparently Im, um Ive never said it out loud before.Bisexual.There.That really wasnt so hard.Im Wow, Holly says.I didnt see that coming.Me neither.I laugh.Its been a really interesting summer.Who is he?Waitthat friend from the hotel!And the rink in Lake Placid!Ryan somebody.Well, fuck.I forgot that women are so weirdly intuitive.Holly, you cant tell anyone.It doesnt matter so much to me, but it could really hurt him.Her sigh is loud in my ear.I wont tell a soul.Buthe dumped you?Ill kill him.Now she has me smiling.You are the best.Have I ever told you that?Eh, she sighs.I have my moments.Hey, now I can stop trying to figure out what sort of girl youd fallen for.Wondering what she had that I dont was really taking up a lot of my free time.Now at least I know the answera dick.I burst out laughing.Damn, Holly.Its good to talk to you.Likewise.When we hang up, theres still a smile on my face.I eat my lunch thinking of all the crazy things Ive done these past six weeks.And one memory in particular solves the problem of finding Wes.I flag down the waitress and pull out my phone.I have an app to download.37      Wes      My first practice is brutal, but thats how I like it.Coach Harvey starts us off with a crossover drill designed to strengthen our ability to accelerate on curves, and it only takes five seconds for me to fully grasp that Im in the big leagues now.Nope, youre not in college anymore, Dorothy.This is a whole new level of intensity, and Im sweating my balls off as I weave in and out of traffic, changing directions on Coachs whim.Pushing myself to keep up with players whove trained together for much longer than the five minutes Ive been with them.And it just picks up in intensity from there, but Im cool with that.This is all I have.This is the choice Ive made.Playing the best hockey I can will be the focus of my life for the next several years.By the time were done, Im so sweaty theres steam rising from the inside of my helmet when I finally pull it off.My legs are like jelly as I walk down the chute into the locker room.Good hustle out there, man.Youre gonna make a good addition, my teammate Tomkins says.Hes three seasons in and doing well, so Im pleased to hear him say it.Thanks.Im happy to be here.And I am.Mostly.After a shower, I get dressed and leave the rink.Im tired, and I dont need to be social anyway, because theres a team dinner starting in two hours.I check my phone for calls, but there arent any.The Brandr app has a new notification, though.Thats weird, because I havent messaged a soul since I came to Toronto.Ive been a good boy.In fact, I should really just delete the fucking app.Lead me not into temptation, and all that.But I read the notification anyway, just in case its from someone I actually know.Theres a message from a brand new profile, with a thumbnail picture I dont recognize.My thumb hovers over the delete button when the senders name sinks in.The message is from PurpleSkittle.And when I open it, his location is clocked at 3.3 km away.Theres an instant shimmy in my chest.Jamie Canning is in Toronto.I steel myself as I open the message, because hes got to be so angry at me.But its for the best.WesI need fifteen minutes of your time.Im going to take this coaching job, and theres something I want to say.Were going to share a city.Its a big one, but still.Tell me where we can meet.I dont care whereStarbucks or whatever the Canadian equivalent is.Do me this favor.J.         I am responding before I even think it through.I tell him yes.Not because its the right thing to do, but because Im powerless to say no.A coffee shop isnt the best idea, though.Too public.So I ask him to meet me at the empty apartment Ive agreed to rent.The real estate agent had asked me if I wanted to get in there to take measurements.Thats a thing, apparently.Id told her yes, and shed left me a key at the front desk.Now Im racing there.The concierge gives me the key and I tell him Im expecting someone to look at the place with me.He promises to send him right up.I ride the elevator with a hammering heart, and when I open the door to the apartment, I look at it with new eyes.Its too much space for one guy.I should have looked for a one bedroom.Jamie is going to look at this place and think I walked away from him so that I could have a big NHL lifestyle.As if I give a fuck about the perks.But the granite countertop and the cherry wood floors laugh at me.This is what you wanted.Im supposed to be here taking measurements, but I havent even brought a measuring tape.And its not the apartment I need to measureits the size of my balls.Jamie is on his way here to tell me Im a fearful asshole, and I really cant argue the point.When the knock comes, Im not ready.But I man up and open the door, and he walks through in a fucking suit and tie, looking hot enough to scorch me.I back up instinctively, because I cannot touch him.Ive never had any willpower where Jamie Canning is concerned.And Im done sending him mixed signals.I cant do that to him anymore.Hi, he says cautiously.Nice place.I shrug because my mouth is too dry to speak.His big brown eyes take in the room, which gives me a minute to admire this man I love, maybe for the last time.His face is tan, and his hair has been trimmed.I know exactly how soft it feels sifting through my fingers.And I know its really a million different colors up close.My ass hits the kitchen counter, and I almost stumble.You okay there?he asks.I nod, helpless.This is so hard.But I brought it on myself.I rest a hand on the granite countertop, and its cool temperature steadies me.Well, theres something I came here to say, even though I know you dont want to hear it.Jamies eyes search me, but I dont know for what.Im done being a jerk to him, and I cant show him how I really feel.That leaves me mute.Thats the best I can do.I dont know what you think happened this summer, he continues, fitting his hands into his trouser pockets.If this coaching thing doesnt work out, he should try becoming the CEO of a company somewhere.Because he really rocks the look.In fact, Im sure youve invented a lot of bullshit in that stubborn head of yours.You think youve corrupted me, or manipulated me, or some shit.My face is hot now.Because I do think that.You think that I was just playing around.Taking a walk on the wild side.You think Im just going to He brushes his hands together as if dusting them off.go back to girls.Chalk this up as an experiment.Yeah, I think that, too.Thats not what happened, Ryan.Not for me.What happened is that I got my best friend back for a little while, and I also fell for him.His voice thickens.Im not just saying that.I fucking love you, and I know thats inconvenient.But I didnt get a chance to tell you in Lake Placid, so Im telling you right now.Just in case we can ever get more than a summer.I love you, and I wish things were different.Theres pressure in my ears, and the world goes a little blurry.I find myself sinking down toward the floor, my back sliding along the expensive wood cabinet, my ass hitting polished cherry.My eyes are wet, so I look out the window.I see blue.That fucking view.Its beautiful, and I just dont care.Because nothing is as beautiful as the man who just told me he loves my fucked up self.Wes.The voice is soft, and its coming closer.I hear the rustle of a suit jacket being removed.A few seconds later, Jamie seats himself on the floor beside me.In my peripheral vision I see muscular forearms jutting from rolled up shirtsleeves.He links his hands around his knees and sighs.I didnt mean to upset you, he says quietly.But it needed to be said.Hes right there.The clean scent of his shampoo and the warmth of his elbow against mine are overwhelming.Ive missed him.So fucking much Ive been walking around with a hollow chasm in my chest where my heart used to be.But that gaping hole is full again.My heart is back, because Jamie is here.And he fucking loves me.My next breath escapes as a shudder.I cant choose, I grind out.Youve already chosen, and I understand why  I give my head a violent shake.No.I mean itI cant choose.I wont choose between you and hockey.I want both.Even if its a disaster.I look at Jamie again, finally, just in time to see him wince.I do not want to be the reason your NHL career doesnt work out, he says vehemently.I get it, Wes.I really do.Theres a tear running down my face and I dont even care.I scoop Jamies hand off his knee and kiss it.He feels so fucking good.Sorry, I choke out.Were going to have to work something out.I love you, goddamn it.His breath hitches.Yeah?Fuck yeah.And Im not letting you walk out of here.Ever?he teases, squeezing my hand.Thats one way to prevent gossip.I sigh.We need a strategy.I have to stay out of the newspapers as long as I can.But, see, thats why  Quiet, baby, I murmur.Let me think for a second.We cant lie forever to save my careerthat isnt fair to Jamie.Maybe he hasnt thought it through, but Ive been gay a long time and I know how much the closet sucks.I need to be sneaky until next June, I finally decide.But thats it.And thats only if Toronto gets pretty far in the playoffs.Just one season.And then what?I shrug.Then you can be my date at the next team barbecue or what the fuck ever.Jamie chuckles, but Im dead serious.It only took one look at him today to realize I cant keep the parts of myself in separate drawers.It was never going to work.What if something happens before June?I mean He sighs again.I cant lie to my family.I can ask them to be discreet, and theyll try.But Im not kidding when I say that I dont want to be your downfall.Think hard about how much risk youre willing to take.Youre worth it, I whisper.Fuck, Im worth it.My change of heart isnt pure generosity.If Jamie is brave enough to walk in here and tell me he loves me, Ive got to take some chances, too.Im going to have a talk with the PR department.Im going to warn them.His hand tightens on mine.You cant be serious.I turn my head against the little wooden wall where were sitting.Im dead serious.Its my life, and yours.Ive loved you for years, babe.If the NHL cant deal with it, then thats just the way it is.Jamies expression softens.That will be a really bad day, though.No.A bad day is you giving up on me.I rake one hand through my hair, and he suddenly captures my wrist, his brown eyes narrowing.When did you get this done?Hes looking at my new tat, and I feel sheepish as I answer, Couple days after I left camp.Rough fingertips skim the line of black ink.What are these coordinates for?Im not surprised hes figured it out.My man is smart.Lake Placid, I tell him.His eyes lock with mine.I see.He clears his throat, but when he speaks again, his voice is still lined with gravel.You really do love me, huh?Always have.I swallow hard.Always will.Its not clear who moves first.But a second later our lips brush, then press together.I moan even before Jamies tongue parts my lips.I kiss him hard, and he gives as good as he gets.Time slips.Once we start kissing we dont stop.My lips are swollen and Im so hard its painful.But this isnt about sex.Each kiss is a promise of more to come.I know we need to stop.There are plans to make, and theres a dinner I have to get to, but each time I tell myself that this is the last kiss, I go back for one more.And then one more.I pull back eventually.You have to live here, I blurt out.Wha?Jamie says, looking dazed.His cheeks are flushed and Ive tousled his hair.A twenty two year old rookie might have a roommate, especially an old hockey friend.It would actually be weirder if you were coming and going all the time.He smiles, and I think hes going to make a joke about coming and going.Did you just ask me to move in with you?Wellyeah.Would you?Jamies eyes sweep the room.I cant afford this place.Im already shaking my head.That is not going to be an issue.You can pay the utilities or some shit.I cant  Yeah, you can.Consider it a gift for putting up with ten months of hiding.I cant pay nothing.Fine.Contribute what you would otherwise budget for rent money.I stand, offering him a hand.Come on, lets have a tour.I dont want to talk about money.Fuck that.Jamie takes my hand and follows me to the little hallway off the kitchen.Well put a bed in this room, but its not going to be our room.You can have a desk in here, though, if you need one for your job.It will give you a place to work.This all seems so easy now.Toronto just became a place I really want to be.And this is our bedroom.I walk him into the big room, which is slotted into a corner of the building.See how private?When we fuck, nobody can hear us.I risk a look at Jamie, and his eyes are molten.Fucking hell.Shouldnt have said that.Im hard, and theres no time to do anything about it.Wait.What time is it, anyway?He checks his watch.Six.Shit!I have to be at this restaurant in a half hour.And my hotel is on the other side of town I look down at what Im wearing.Track pants and flip flops.Great.Im going to be late for my first team event.Goddamn it.I chuckle, because its either that or cry.And Ive already done the latter today.Babe, do you want to wear this?Jamie indicates his suit.Really?He shrugs.You dont have to, but  Lets try it.I laugh, because this is crazy.But thats what happens when he and I are together.Crazy happens.And we are just about the same size.Jamies waist might be a little wider than mine, but hes wearing a belt.Hes looking down at himself, doing the same math.What size are your feet?Ten and a half.Im eleven, he says.Close enough.Were grinning like idiots as we strip off our clothes in the big empty bedroom.Jamie is down to only his dress socks, and I groan at the view.I hope this dinner doesnt last too long.Will you stay with me tonight at the hotel?He licks his lips.Sure.But youll have to tell me where that is.He passes me his shirt and I put it on.It smells like him.Im going to be horny all evening.The best kind of torture.We make the switch and I dont look half bad.The jacket shoulders are a little wider than Id wear them, but fuck, who cares.I forgot something.What?I work on tying Jamies tie, but theres no mirror, so its slow going.That night we were making the list of benefits of being gay?Borrowing your boyfriends clothes.Clucking his tongue, he pushes my hands out of the way and straightens the knot.You look hot in my suit.You look hot in anything.He reaches down and squeezes my dick through the wool trousers.You get a blowjob later, just for saying that.I groan.Then I have a thought so evil I almost cant say it with a straight face.Tonight, I want you in nothing but my Toronto jersey.Jamie sputters with laughter and gives my cheek a fake slap.You ass.Im not your puck bunny.Please?Ive never fucked a puck bunny.This is my only chance.He wraps his arms around my body and squeezes my ass.I receive a single, bruising kiss before he steps back.Now give me your hotel key and go to your dinner already.No more lip.When I step out onto the sidewalk a few minutes later, Im a little dazed and walking carefully in shoes that are slightly too big.And Ive never felt better in my life.38      AUGUST      Wes   At the end of my first week of training camp, Coach Harvey shifts the lines around and puts me in the second line with Eriksson and Forsberg.The latter led Chicago to a Stanley Cup win three seasons ago before being traded to Toronto.The former was tied for highest scoring offensive player last season.And then theres meRyan Wesley, wet behind the ears rookie, skating with two goddamn legends.Its a promising sign, because that means theyre seriously considering me for the roster this season, instead of sending me down to the farm team for more development.Our shift lasts two minutes, and just before Coach shouts for a line change, I slap a one timer past the goalie (another former Stanley Cup champ) and accept a vigorous back clap from Eriksson, whos grinning behind his facemask.Shi it, kid, that was a beauty!The praise warms me up inside.And Im even giddier when I notice Coach nodding in approval from the bench.Youve got solid instincts, he tells me when I heave myself over the boards a moment later.No hesitation.I like that.Is hearing that good for my ego?Damn right it is.These past two weeks, Ive learned that praise from our head coach comes about as often as a solar eclipse.But even though he pushes us hard and is tough as nails, hes a nice guy when were not on the ice, and the man sure knows his hockey.Forsberg sidles up to me as I head down the chute, ruffling my hair like Im a five year old.Youre fast, Wesley.Keep showing off that speed in practice, okay?I want you on my line.My heart does a crazy somersault.Jesus Christ.How is this my life?But my good mood doesnt stick.Im scheduled to meet with one of the team publicists in thirty minutes, and depending on how that goes, practice might not be the only thing thats over today.My career might end, too.Before it even begins.I havent changed my mind, though, no matter how many times Jamie has urged me to reconsider.Im not giving him up.This next year might be tough for us, especially if my publicist goes all fire and brimstone on my ass to keep the relationship under wraps.But I know we can weather through it.I love Jamie.Ive always loved Jamie.And now that I know he feels the same way, I cant wait to see him again.To live with him again.After accepting the coaching job and informing Detroit of his decision, Jamie went back to Lake Placid for two weeks.He told me this plan when we were lying in my hotel room after sex.And even in that blissed out state, Id thought it was a terrible idea.Dont go, Id argued.I just got you back.Smiling, hed kissed me.We cant get into the apartment yet, anyway.And Pat needs the help.Plus, this means you can focus all your energy on impressing your coach.I miss the hell out of him, but Ive done what he suggested.All I do is practice and talk to him on the phone at night.My lease on the condo began three days ago.I went shopping for the essentialsa king sized mattress and a giant flat screen TV.But thats all Im buying until Jamie comes back next week to help me pick everything out.Actually, I found an armchair on the curb yesterday and hauled it upstairs.But when I set it in front of the living room windows I noticed that it wobbled.I snapped a pic of the chair and texted it to Jamie with a note about finding it outside.His response was fast and furious: It has to go!People throw shit out for a reason!I bet you someone died on that chair!Tonights agenda: getting rid of the death chair and going grocery shopping.Look at me being all domestic.Im kinda digging it.After Ive showered in the locker room and changed into my street clothes, I walk toward the elevator bank at the far end of the training arena.The PR guy agreed to meet me in the upstairs offices, saving me from having to trek to the teams head offices on the other end of the city during rush hour.He waits for me in the corridor when I step off the elevator.Ive already met him once before.It was after I signed my contract, when hed given me an info packet about the promotional events Ill be expected to attend this season.Ryan, he says warmly, extending his hand.Good to see you again.Frank, I greet him as we shake hands.Thanks for coming down to meet with me.Anything for our new rookie superstar.He grins and gestures for me to follow him.A moment later, were seated in a small office with a view of the parking lot.Frank dons a wry look.Not exactly the lap of luxury here.I cant even offer you anything to drink.Thats fine.I just chugged two bottles of water in the locker room.I caught the end of practice.It looks like youre meshing well with the other guys.I think so, I admit.Hopefully Coach agrees.Frank smiles.Trust me, kid, Hal loves you.I heard that when the coaches were going over the draft prospects, he refused to look at any other centers.You were his first and only choice.Pleasure shoots through me.Then guilt.Because the thought of disappointing my new coach makes me sick to my stomach.But the thought of not having Jamie in my life makes me even sicker.So, listen.I had something important to discuss with you, I start awkwardly.Franks expression goes serious.Is everything okay?Someone giving you trouble?I shake my head.No, nothing like that.A rueful sigh slips out.If anything, Im the one whos about to give you trouble.He actually laughs.Gotta tell you, lots of conversations start this way.By now, Im unshockable, Ryan.Just hit me.I clasp my hands in my lap to stop from fidgeting.Frankthe roommate I listed as my emergency contact on my health forms?Hes actually my boyfriend.But, uh, nobody else knows.He doesnt even blink.Right.Right?Confusion fills my gut as I attempt to make sense of his response.It hadnt sounded sarcastic, like riiiiiight, sure he is.It hadnt sounded hostile.It hadnt sounded like anything.Im only telling you this, uh, because it could leak out.Id never try to bring negative publicity to the team, I hurry on.My sexual orientation has nothing to do with my skills as a hockey player.I plan on playing my ass off for this club, and I truly hope that who I date in my spare time wont affect my teammates opinions of me as a player.But I also know the media will jump on this story if it gets out.Frank is nodding now.I I take a breath.I mean, Im living with someone.Its serious.The only, um, scandal is that hes a he.His lips twitch.Fucking hell.Is he laughing at me?I clench my teeth and force myself to continue.Were willing to be as discreet as the team needs us to be, but we cant hide our relationship forever.We shouldnt have to.My breath comes out in a rush.So I figured Id disclose this information and let you and the team decide what happens next.Frank leans forward, resting his arms on the desktop.Ryan.He chuckles.I appreciate you coming forward, butwe already knew about your sexual orientation.I cough in surprise.You did?Son, we have a thorough vetting process for all our draft prospects.The last thing a club needs is to draft a kid in the first round, only to find out later that hes got a criminal record a mile long or hes addicted to pills or has some other skeleton in his closet that might negatively impact the league.Jesus.So they knew I was gay before they drafted me?How?I voice the troubled thought.How did you know?He chuckles again.Were you trying to keep it a secret?Because from what we gleaned, your college teammatesand coacheswere well aware of it.Imdumbfounded.My coach told you?He shrugs like this is nothing surprising.The coach didnt want you to hitch your wagon to a team that wouldnt treat you right.He did you a favor.And like I said, Hal was impressed with you, and not just with the level of talent you bring to the team.Youre smart, discreet, youve got a good head on your shoulders.Thats all that matters to him.To us.So I try to find my voice.You guys dont care that Im involved with another man?Not at all.He folds his hands together.In fact, Ive already written the press release for whenever this eventually leaks.The organization has agreed on all the supportive language.Were ready.I just sit there, my mind reeling.Theres something tickling the back of my brain about this discussion.It almost sounds as if theyre hoping to issue that press release.Whats in it for you?I blurt.He grins.Faith in our fellow man?Bullshit.What does this get you?Frank opens his hands in a gesture of humility.Last year we traded Kim to Anaheim, and Owens to Miami.Because we had  too many right handed D men, I finish.Frank nods.Only Kim is Korean American and Owens was He stares at the ceiling trying to remember.I forget.But some dipshit sports reporter made a big stir about how we didnt want to be a diverse team.Someone jumped on that and started a petition that somehow gathered twenty five thousand signatures.I cant believe what Im hearing.So you drafted the faggot.Frank rolls his eyes.Ill have to ask you not to use that word, son.Its not nice.My groan echoes off the walls of the office.Please tell me youre not going to leak my sexual orientation the next time some asshole writes that Toronto isnt a PC organization.I dont want to be your pawn.He grins.Were not interested in turning you into a poster boy for gay athletes.We dont need to invite the circus to townit always shows up eventually.But we wont be sending you out to face the media waving a rainbow flag, or ask you to give interviews touting yourself as the first openly gay player in the NHL.He air quotes the headline, chuckling again, and I realize theyve put a lot of thought into this.And meanwhile, Ive spent every waking moment since I got drafted worrying about how I would keep it under wraps.I gotta say, though.If youre telling me youre in a committed relationship, Im doing a happy dance.When the press finally catches on to you, it wont be some photo of you in a skeezy bathhouse on Jarvis Street.I prefer the visual of you and your boyfriend having a candlelit dinner.I open my mouth to argue with this bit of cynicism, and then discover I dont care enough to fight this fight.Toronto is keeping me, even if Jamie and I are outed.Thats all that matters, I tell myself.And the man in front of me is paid to think like a jackass, just like Im paid to think like a killer.Is there anything else you wanted to discuss, Ryan?I blink.Um...no.That was it.Frank scrapes his chair back and stands up.Then I hope you dont mind if we cut this chat short.I need to speak to Hal before I head home to the wife and kids.My legs are wobbly as I follow him to the door, where he stops to clap me on the shoulder.You should come to dinner at our place sometime.Your boyfriends welcome, too.I blink again.What fucking planet am I on right now?He grins at my confusion.I know youre new to the city and probably havent met a lot of folks yet.And my wife loves to host members of the team.Shell be thrilled if you came by.Oh.Um, sure, then.I appreciate the invite.We go our separate ways once we reach the lobby.Im not feeling too steady on my feet as I head outside and walk toward the subway stop.Its like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and Im not sure how to handle the sensation it leaves behind.Lightness, giddiness.Relief.I cant wait to tell Jamie.39      Jamie      Its been a long day of coaching.Pat runs a two week intensive at the end of camp, and we really fill the place up.Since the dorm is jam packed, the kids who show up stay in condos with their parents.We max out our ice time, and we max out our waking hours.Its tough, but I love it.Im on pins and needles all day, though, because Wes has his meeting with the PR guy.So after the last session of the day, I run back to the dorm.This morning I intentionally left my phone in the room so I wouldnt spend the day checking it.Theres something in front of my door.Its a FedEx package.When I pick it up, its weightless.I unlock the door and push inside my mostly empty room.Pat is still a coach short, which means its a good thing I came back to help him.Checking the phone is the first thing I do.There arent any voicemails, and the only email is a solicitation for discount sunglasses.So I turn my attention to the package, tearing off the strip at the edge and opening the envelope.A gift box falls outthe same one I recently filled with purple Skittles.I yank open the top and find a piece of paper inside, grinning when I see a single purple Skittle taped to the page.Its the result of recent medical tests on Mr.Ryan E.  Wesley, Jr.Every STD known to man is listed there, and the word negative appears after each one.Hes scribbled something at the bottom: I was going to fill this box with purple condoms, but then I had a better idea.Annnnd now Im horny as well as impatient.So I commence pacing the room.When the email program on my phone pings a few minutes later, I yank it out of my pocket to read the message.But its not from Wes.Dear Coach Canning,  I cant believe that I didnt get to finish the session with you.Im still not speaking to my father, either.Working with you has been the best summer of my life, and Im pissed that it ended on a bitter note.
