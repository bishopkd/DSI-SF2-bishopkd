She hit the button for live radar with a storm tracking projection, and as she watched the bright red center of a huge thunderstorm creeping eastward, her uneasiness turned into cold, clammy fear.It was heading straight for Rainbow Valley.18    The storm is moving slowly, Daniel said, but that means once it starts dumping rain, its not going to stop for a long time.We have maybe six or seven hours before it hits.Kari went to the window and looked to the west.The late September sun cast a stunning glow across the vineyard, where the grapes were so ripe they nearly burst out of their skins.But in the far distance, she saw pale gray clouds, ones that could become dark thunderheads within a few hours.Then she looked at the vine covered hills and imagined the grapes soaking up all that water.A whole vintage can be ruined that way.The memory of Marcs words sent an icy feeling right down Karis spine.She glanced back at Daniel.He looked angry.Frustrated.So why wasnt he doing something?Wont the rain damage the grapes?she asked.Hell yes, it will.Then they have to be harvested.With what?Daniel said.I dont have a crew scheduled until next week!Cant you find another one?I already tried, Daniel said, desperation flooding his voice.Theres nobody.And Marcs not answering his phone.Hes probably avoiding me.But it doesnt matter, anyway.He couldnt do anything even if he were here.He closed his eyes.Hes going to fucking kill me.Did you call Nina?she asked him.Angela?Can they help?Whats the point?Daniel said, throwing his hands in the air.Even if they come, well never get it done in time.Ramon and Michael are here.Two more people isnt going to cut it.It wouldnt even be close.Not if we have to harvest in a hurry.At least we can get started.No.Its a lost cause.We have to try.Can you go down to the vineyard?Do whatever you have to do to get things under way?Kari, Daniel said with a look of desperation, you dont understand.Itll take two people just to get the grapes that are picked into the destemmer/crusher and then into the fermentation tanks.Those are two people who cant be picking grapes.Then the rest of us will just have to pick faster.Us?Ill help.Are you kidding?Youll barely be able to lift one of the empty five gallon bins, much less one full of grapes.But I can pick them.It cant be that hard.The hell its not.Its the shittiest work imaginable.But do you have to have any special skills?Nope.Clip the bunches with shears and throw them in the bins.But do that about a thousand times and youll want to shoot yourself in the head.I dont care.Im helping.Will you stop being so damned nave?There are only four of us.Six if you count Nina and Angela.We wont even be able to come close to getting those grapes in.We need four times that many people!Daniel, is that storm going to hit?No doubt about it.Okay.I know you and Marc arent getting along.But do you really want him knowing a storm was coming that was going to ruin the crop, but you didnt even try to do anything about it?Daniel looked away, his jaw tightening with frustration.Finally he let out a breath.No.I dont.Then go down and get things started.Ill call Nina and Angela and see if they can come.Then Ill change clothes and come down there.Kari  Daniel.Go!Daniel shoved away from the table and left the kitchen.Kari grabbed her phone and called Nina.The second Kari mentioned the extent of the thunderstorm, Nina knew the vineyard was in trouble.She said shed shut down the shop and head over with Rupert and Bonnie.She also said shed call Angela on the way, as well as a few other people who might be able to help.Kari felt a tiny glimmer of hope.More people.That could only be a good thing.Then Nina asked where Marc was.Oh, God.Kari didnt want to talk about that, and she didnt want to lie.But what choice did she have?He took another trip to try out his motorcycle, she told Nina.Daniel tried to get in touch with him, but hes not answering.Well, somebody needs to find him, or we really are screwed.Try him again, will you?Uhyeah.I will.As soon as Kari hung up, she took a deep breath and tried Marcs number.The phone rang three times.Four.Five.And then it flipped to voice mail.She left a message, telling him the situation and asking him to call back.Surely hed pick it up.She went to Marcs bedroom to put on the crappiest clothes she had, and by the time shed changed, he hadnt called back.No matter how much he thought he wanted to get away from this place, she couldnt imagine him turning his back on this kind of problem by ignoring her call.Then she had a terrible thought.She turned slowly to look at his dresser.The power cord for his phone was still plugged in and resting on it where it always was.Hed been in such a hurry to get out of there that hed forgotten it.If his phone was out of power, hed have no way of knowing shed called.So there it was.If he happened to see a weather report somewhere else, he might call.If not  Her only hope was that he was on his way back home already.She knew she had every right to be upset with Marc for leaving the way he had.But as strong as hed been for everybody else, maybe he had a right to fall apart a little when he realized the plans hed been making for years had exploded right before his eyes.But whether he knew it or not, his love for this place went soul deep, and shed be damned if she was going to let anything bad happen to it as long as there was breath left in her body.Marc woke to sunlight angling through the partially open motel blinds and stabbing him in the eyes.He turned over to get away from it, only to have his head pound as if a little man was inside it, beating it with a hammer.He put his hand to his forehead with a groan, finally rolling to his back and letting out a heavy sigh.Then he turned painfully to look at the clock.It was two oclock in the afternoon.Good God, how much had he had to drink?The events of the night before came back to him bit by bit, but everything seemed jumbled, like puzzle pieces rattling around in a box.He remembered walking to the bar.Having dinner and a beer.Having several beers.Then there had been a woman  He whipped around to look at the bed beside him, breathing a sigh of relief when he realized he was alone.He rose from the bed and fumbled with the coffeepot on top of the dresser.When the little red light wouldnt come on in spite of the fact that it was plugged in, he realized the damned thing was broken.He threw the coffee packet aside and put his palms on the counter, bowing his head.Then he slowly looked up again and stared at himself in the mirror.His hair was crunched to one side, and he had a day old growth of beard that made his creased face look even more pathetic.And his head was on the verge of exploding.He was pretty sure he hadnt grabbed a bottle of aspirin as he was blindly tossing stuff from his medicine cabinet into his bag, but he sat on the bed and went through it anyway, hoping to find one.Then he saw something in the side pocket he didnt recognize.He slid it out and stared at it.It was a black and white photo.He looked at the tiny identifying words along the bottom.Worthington, Kari.Then yesterdays date.Recognition came slowly, but when he finally realized what it was, his heart stood still.It was nothing but black and white blobs all running together, but still he knew what he was looking at.An ultrasound photo of their baby.The instant Kari told him he was going to be a father, every restrictive image in the book had filled his mind: Handcuffs.A straitjacket.A noose around his neck.But as he looked at this photo now, he wasnt thinking about those things.Instead his mind overflowed with memories he hadnt thought about in a very long time.He remembered Angela walking for the first time.Shed toddled along for three shaky steps, then fallen into his arms.Hed scooped her up and whooped with joy, and shed been all smiles.He remembered the ballet recital when she was five and not a single kid on the stage had a clue what to do.It had been a whirl of sparkles and spangles on tiny little bodies, all going in different directions.He remembered the breakfast shed made for him on Fathers Day when she was tenovercooked eggs and burnt toast that hed eaten as if it was five star cuisine.How could he have forgotten all that?How could the bad times have dominated his memories, shoving the good times aside until he barely remembered them?Kari must have put this photo in his bag before hed stormed out of the house yesterday.Kari, who was back in Rainbow Valley right now, most likely wondering where the father of her baby was and how he could have acted like such a colossal bastard.Marc dropped the photo to his lap.God in heavenwhat was he doing here?Hed told himself that seeing the country would open him up to new opportunities he didnt even know existed.That after a few years, he wouldnt even remember what life was like in Rainbow Valley because there was a whole world out there for the taking.But being here now had given him a glimpse of that kind of life, and it seemed like a miserable proposition.A stark highway, a cold barstool, alcohol that had muddled his mind, and a nameless woman who was just looking for a good time.That was the life he thought he wanted?Then he remembered his deal with Kari.No commitment.No strings.Just sex.Was that all shed ever wanted from him, too?Just sex?Then he thought about how they made love, about how she looked up at him afterward, her green eyes shining with satisfaction.Looking back now, he could see that their relationship had changed.In a matter of just a few weeks, shed become a different woman, one he admired in a way he couldnt have imagined that rainy night shed shown up on his doorstep.The more his respect for her grew, the more desperate he felt to be with her.But how did she feel about him?It was a scary question, because he wasnt sure of the answer.Then he remembered her words right before he stormed out of his bedroom.I would never leave you.Shed said it not once, but twice.Hed ignored her both times, telling her she didnt mean it, that she wouldnt be there when the going got tough.How could he have discounted her words as if they meant nothing when they meant everything to him?Would she ever forgive him for that?He looked at the photo again.It was nothing but gray blobs and dark shadows, but he knew somewhere in it was his future, the kind of future he couldnt have imagined wanting but now he craved with everything he had in him.He thought about calling Kari, only to remember one more thing from last nighthis phone was out of juice.He looked at the room phone and thought about picking it up, but what would he say when she came on the line?He always screwed up when it came to saying the right thing.Always.And he couldnt risk that now.Not when they were hundreds of miles apart, when he couldnt take her in his arms and show her how much he cared.His head was pounding.His heart was aching.The only way to make it all stop was to go home.Tell her what an idiot hed been.Beg her forgiveness.Then take her in his arms and plead with her to love him as much as he loved her.After what hed done, though, he was afraid shed never want to speak to him again.Kari headed down to the vineyard to find the men stacking empty bins near the first several rows of grapevines.Daniel gave her a crash course in picking grapes.She put on gloves, picked up shears, and started in.At first it seemed like an easy task, but after thirty minutes, her arms and back ached, and nausea churned away in her stomach.She wondered how long shed be able to keep this up before fainting dead away.Nina arrived with Rupert and Bonnie, but Kari could already see Daniel was right.Theyd never be able to pull this off with so few people.Its hard work, Nina told her.Keep going as long as you can, but dont kill yourself.Its not worth that.There are a few more people on the way.Kari nodded and kept on picking, but as the minutes passed, she grew more hopeless.She had to stop every few minutes and stand perfectly still, squeezing her eyes closed, willing her nausea to subside.The whole time, Daniels words circled around inside her head.Well never get it done in time.Then she heard the rumble of engines, and she turned to see the most amazing sight.In the distance, several cars and trucks were pulling through onto the property and making their way down the road.They circled the house and came to a halt near the gate leading to the vineyard.People piled outsome Kari knew and some she didntand every one of them was dressed for dirty work.Kari walked over to Nina.Whats happening?Im not sure.I told only a few people.Gus got out of one of the cars.Nina called out to him, Gus!Whats going on?He walked over.When you told me about the storm, I told a few other people.Pretty soon everybody was spreading the word.Therell be more folks here soon.Theyre coming to pick grapes?Nina asked.Yep.The moment people found out Marc was in trouble, you couldnt keep them away.Within the next half hour, Kari watched in awe as at least thirty people grabbed bins and shears and headed out to the field.Then Rosie and Estelle brought ice chests with food and drinks and set up a spread in the barn.Kari stuck with the story that Marc had taken a motorcycle trip and was out of pocket and had no idea the storm was on its way.Not a solitary person questioned it, and Kari knew it was because they assumed if Marc wasnt there, there had to be a damned good reason why.Then Angela arrived.Kari automatically felt a rush of apprehension.Angela belonged there, and in the last twenty four hours, Kari had begun to feel as if she didnt.When Angela came through the gate into the vineyard, she stopped to stare at Kari.Kari shoved her hair out of her face, but she could only imagine what she looked like wearing grape stained gloves, with sweat pouring down her temples, her arms already scraped up from the grapevines, and the red welt of a wasp sting on her neck.I talked to Uncle Daniel, she said, nodding over her shoulder toward the barn.He said he cant get in touch with my dad.Yeah, Kari said.He took a motorcycle trip, and we cant get hold of him.And he forgot the power cord for his phone, so if its out of juice, thats why hes not answering.If he knew what was going on, hed be here.Of course he would.Kari clipped another bunch of grapes and tossed it into the nearly full bin at her feet.Youre helping, Angela said.Yeah, Kari said, Im helping.Angela kept looking at her, as if the sight of Kari picking grapes just didnt compute.Why?Angela asked.Why?Oh, God.There were so many answers to that question.Because I love your father.I love this vineyard, and so does he.I want to stay here forever and raise our baby together.But those were things she couldnt say yet, so she finally settled on something that was just as heartfelt and the absolute truth.Because your dad helped me when I needed it the most.And now theres nothing I wouldnt do for him.Angela regarded her for a moment more, then grabbed a cluster of grapes, clipped it, and tossed it into the bin that was nearly full.Be sure not to lift that, she told Kari.Ill do it.Im used to it.And here.Let me show you something about the shears.If youll hold them like this, you can cut through the vine a whole lot easier.Kari worked side by side with Angela as the storm drew closer and dark clouds billowed on the horizon.Kari had to agree with Daniel.Picking grapes was the shittiest work imaginable.Soon daylight faded to the point that Kari was having a hard time seeing the grapes to pick them.She was just wondering what they were going to do when it got completely dark, only to have Rick from Ricks Automotive show up with two of his employees, all of them driving trucks with spotlights on the roofs so everybody would be able to keep on picking.Kari stayed on the verge of tears the whole time because her muscles were screaming, she was nauseated, and she wasnt sure she could pick one more cluster of grapes even though she had to no matter what.But the biggest reason she felt like crying was because this place was so amazing and these people were so wonderful.And then something happened that finally pushed her over the edge.Luke and Shannon showed up.They said they were in San Antonio on their honeymoon, but they heard Marc was in trouble, so they came back right away to help.The very idea of them hurrying home from their honeymoon was just a little too much wonderful all in one place, and way more than Kari could handle.Kari?Angela said.Whats wrong?She wiped her cheeks with her dirty glove.Nothing, she said, because nothing was.It was right, so much more right than she ever could have imagined.She wished she could talk to Marc.She wished she could tell him how much all these people cared about him.Ask him how he could even think of leaving this town, turning his back on the very thing shed been looking for all her life.And then shed tell him she loved him.19    Marc was an hour and a half away from Rainbow Valley when he saw the storm clouds.At first it was nothing more than a graying of the sky to the west, but as the clouds bulged and swelled into dark thunderheads, his apprehension grew.These were the kinds of clouds vintners feared the most at harvest time.Hed seen a big storm system on the radar yesterday, but he was sure it was going to swing north of Rainbow Valley.This one looked to be heading right for it.He cursed himself for forgetting his phone charger.He needed to see a weather report.Find out what was behind those dark clouds and how much rain they could conceivably dump.But did it really matter?Nothing could be done if Daniel couldnt get a crew in there, and chances were excellent he couldnt.But if that storm hit Rainbow Valley dead center, the crop could be ruined.Damn it!Why hadnt Daniel brought the grapes in when he had the chance?He had to know what was going on.He had to.Fifteen minutes later, he came upon a gas station.No pay phone.Did those even exist anymore?He went inside and asked the guy behind the counter if he could use the phone.As he started to dial, all at once it dawned on him he didnt know Daniels number.Hell, he didnt know anybodys number.They were programmed into his cell phone, which was currently dead in his pocket.Then he realized he could call directory assistance and get the number of the wine store in town.But when he called the number and the phone rang, nobody picked up.Get home.Just get home.He got back on his motorcycle and hit the highway again.The stormy skies were bringing darkness much sooner than usual.He drove faster than he really should have, even though he had no idea what hed be able to do when he got to the vineyard.An average harvest meant a couple days of effort, so even if the crew Daniel had scheduled could come early, it wouldnt be enough men to do the job.By the time he neared the Rainbow Valley city limits, a few raindrops began to fall.Two minutes later, the heavens opened up.Marc ducked his head against the wind and the deluge of rain, which was forcing him to go slower so he didnt lay the bike down going around curves.And all he could think was, Im too late.The crop will be ruined.He felt the loss already, forming a hole in his heart so deep he was surprised it could still pump blood.If only he hadnt gotten it in his head that he wanted to leave Rainbow Valley in the first place, this wouldnt be happening.If he hadnt acted like a bastard to Kari and realized where his future really was, he would have been at the vineyard, finding some kind of solution.But no.Hed screwed up things on both fronts, so when he got home, hed find an entire crop on the verge of being destroyed and a sweet, beautiful woman hed hurt so deeply shed probably never forgive him.As he came around the last curve, he saw the lights from the vineyard shining weakly through the falling rain.A few minutes later he drove through the gate and started down the long gravel drive.Then he saw the most unbelievable sight.The house was nearly dark, but cars and trucks were everywhere.The driveway was so full he had to plow across the rain soaked lawn to circle the house, where he saw even more vehicles.And then he saw them.People.In the vineyard.Everywhere there were people.He leaped off his motorcycle and hurried to the vineyard gate, feeling as if he was moving through a dreamworld where things couldnt possibly be as they seemed.One by one, he started to recognize the people.Gus.Rick.Terri.Luke and Shannon.Bonnie.Rupert.Other friends and neighbors.They were dripping wet and filthy dirty with grape stained gloves, still clipping one bunch after another and tossing them into bins as rain bombarded them.Three big trucks, each with a pair of spotlights, lit each row so they could go on picking in the dark.Not a single one of these people were part of a paid harvest crew.Not one.Yet they were harvesting his grapes?From the look of things, theyd been at it for hours.He turned to see Michael driving the tractor to the barn, and behind it was a trailer full of grapes.Daniel and Ramon were grabbing the bins off it, manhandling them into the destemmer/crusher to prepare them for the fermentation tanks.Marc ran to the barn, shouting over the thundering rain, Daniel!Daniel spun around.Marc!Where the hell have you been?Never mind.How much of the crop is in?Maybe eighty or ninety percent.Marc was dumbfounded.Theyd gotten that many of the grapes in?How the hell had they done it?Is Kari in the house?he shouted.No.Shes in the vineyard!Marc felt a shot of apprehension.Shes picking grapes?Yeah.Shes about to drop.I tried to get her to stop, but she refused to quit!No.She had no business out in this weather exerting herself like that.Not when she was pregnant.If anything happened to her, he was never going to forgive himself.All at once thunder crashed, and in the distance he saw a zigzag of lightning.The storms getting worse!he shouted to Daniel.I want everybody out of here!Help me spread the word!Daniel abandoned the machine and hurried after Marc.They ran into the vineyard, where they shouted at everybody to drop everything and head for home.As Marcs rain drenched friends and neighbors headed for their cars and trucks, he knew he owed them a debt of gratitude he could never repay.Dad!Marc turned to see Angela running up behind him, rain soaked and grape stained.I think Karis sick!she shouted.Where is she?This way.Hurry!Marc ran after Angela, row past muddy row, until he finally spotted Kari.He slogged through the mud to where she stood.She was clutching a grapevine in one hand and shears in the other, her head bowed.Kari!Her head jerked up.You shouldnt be out here!he shouted.Get inside!Not finished!There are more grapes!Leave them!Another bolt of lightning sizzled through the sky.He took her shears and tossed them down.Then he grabbed her arm and pulled her along.She stumbled a little and righted herself, but when she stumbled again, he could tell she was on the verge of collapsing.Finally he just swept her into his arms.Angela!Marc shouted.Find Aunt Nina!I want you both in the barn!He hurried through the vineyard gate, fear hammering him all the way to the house.Please God, dont let anything happen to her.And please let our baby be okay.The rain came down in torrents, but he ducked his head against it and carried her across the deck and into the house.When he got to his bedroom, he laid her carefully on the bed.She took a deep, shaky breath and let it out slowly, blinking open those beautiful green eyes.He waited for her to smile.She didnt.Instead, she looked wary and apprehensive, and he knew why.She didnt know what was in his head right then.The last time they talked, she told him she was pregnant, and what had he done?Hed gotten on his motorcycle and driven away.How much more of a bastard could he possibly have been?He grabbed towels from the bathroom, wiped his own dripping hair, then sat down beside her.Her hair was wet and tangled, a shock of auburn against the pillowcase beneath her head.The pink streak in her hair had faded, but he could still see it, reminding him one more time of the joy shed brought to his life.But lying in this bed right now, she looked small and weak and helpless, and he hated himself all over again for leaving her when she needed him the most.He pulled off her dirty gloves and tossed them on the floor.With a dry towel, he dabbed rainwater off her face.Kari?Are you okay?Im fine.The baby?Were both okay.Are you sure?You dont look okay.Just tired.He wasnt sure about that.You worked too hard out there.I want to make sure youre all right.Its okay.Id know if something was wrong.She took a deep breath and let it out slowly.I feel much better just lying here.But theres more to do.The rain is here, and we didnt get them all.Forget that for now.Just rest.But  Most of the grapes are in.Im here now, Kari.Im going to go take care of the rest of it.Im going to take care of everything.He took her hand, stroking it gently with his thumb, feeling like such a bastard for the grief hed caused her.Im so sorry for the things I said, he told her.I never should have left.Can you ever forgive me for that?Things get too hard for everybody sometimes.Its okay.No, its not okay.I left when you needed me the most.Youre here now.Thats all that matters.No.He didnt deserve this.After what hed done, what hed said, she should be telling him to go to hell.You dont have to worry, Kari.Im never leaving again.In that moment, it was as if every bit of the tension she was holding on to melted out of her body.She blinked wearily, and he could tell she was on the edge of sleep.I need to get back out there, Marc said.Just rest.Then later  Wait.About Daniel.What about him?He told me he wants to pay Angelas college tuition, but you wont let him.Kari.This isnt the time to talk about that.Just listen.Please listen.I know you think you dont need his money and that hes just showing off.But its more than that.Whether you know it or not, Daniel is dying for your respect.He cant get it by running this place, because youll always be better at that than he is.But if you take the money he earned by doing something hes good at and thank him for making your life easier, youre finally telling him you approve.Marc had never once thought about it that way.All hed ever seen was his brothers smart ass behavior and assumed his success was some kind of accident because he couldnt possibly focus on anything worthwhile.But maybe it wasnt an accident.Hed worked hard.Hed given the market what it wanted, and hed profited from it.Worse, Marc had always assumed that taking his younger brothers money meant Daniel was actually looking down on him.Kari squeezed Marcs hand, looking at him earnestly.He loves you, Marc.And so does everybody in this town.As soon as they knew you were in trouble, they dropped everything and came.It was amazing.There isnt anything they wouldnt do for you, and its because youve done so much for them.Do you understand that?Yes.He did now.Right now his friends and family were driving home, soaked to the skin and feeling as if theyd been to hell and back, all because theyd come there to help him when his head was so screwed up he couldnt help himself.I understand, he said.And Luke and Shannon, too.They came home from their honeymoon.Can you believe it?Youre the one I cant believe.Youre pregnant.You shouldnt have been out there like that.I had to help.If I thought there was a problem with the baby, Id have stopped.But at least I had to try.You love this place.I see you on the deck, looking out over the vineyard, and I know.I know.With everything going on, I think you lost sight of that, but if you never hear another word I say, please hear this.You love this place.And I couldnt let you lose even one tiny bit of something you love that much.She was right.It was as if hed been wearing blinders all these years, blinders created by all the pain and hard work and the misguided sense that he needed to leave in order to have a life.That wasnt true.This was his life.Kari sighed wearily, as if the last words shed spoken used up the final bit of energy she had.Marc?Yeah?Her voice fell to a sleepy whisper.I love this place, too.She paused.And I love you.Those words hit Marc like an arrow straight to his heart.He bowed his head, feeling guilty and elated and ashamed and euphoric all at the same time.Even after everything hed done, she loved him?It was more than he ever could have hoped for.Even with the gloves shed been wearing, her hands were still rubbed raw.He brought her palm to his lips and kissed it, unable to believe he was getting another chance at this.I love you, too, he said.The briefest of smiles crossed her lips, and she squeezed his hand.Then her eyes fell closed, and a few seconds later he realized shed fallen asleep.He knew now that her running away from her wedding hadnt been a cowardly thing for her to do.For the person shed been at that moment, who was just learning how to be herself and was terrified of the consequences, it was the most courageous thing she could possibly have done.And he knew now that she wouldnt run from responsibility.She wouldnt leave him or their baby.She would stay and fight no matter how tough things got.All these weeks hed talked about his need to be free, to have no connections, no responsibility, nothing holding him back, telling her in essence that shed better not be a woman who expected more because he didnt have it to give.But now he felt as if hed give her everything he had in him, right up to his dying breath.He had more to say to her.So much more.But right now she needed to rest, and he needed to help Daniel get as many grapes processed as he absolutely could.He was going back outside to finish what he should have started, because this place was his future.Nina and Daniel might be part owners, but Cordero Vineyards was his responsibility, now and forever.And he never wanted it any other way.20    Three hours later, Marc and Daniel came back into the kitchen.Marc grabbed two dish towels out of a drawer and tossed one of them to Daniel.They rubbed the excess rainwater off themselves and collapsed at the table.Marc had sent Nina and Angela back to the house an hour ago.Nina wanted to drive home, but with the storm still raging, Marc insisted she stay the night.She and Angela were probably already asleep in Angelas room upstairs.You look like shit, Daniel said.Thats because I feel like shit, Marc said.You dont look so hot yourself.Thats because harvest sucks.Particularly when youre doing part of it in the rain.Daniel sighed.Okay.Let me have it.Let you have what?Oh, come on.Youre not letting this one go by.Just say it.If Id harvested when I should have, this wouldnt have happened.And youre right.Maybe you were right, Marc said.Maybe the grapes needed another week on the vine.But the storm  You couldnt have seen that coming.At least you got things moving when it looked as if rain was on its way.Yeah, well  What?He rubbed his hand over his chin, staring at the tabletop.Then he looked up at Marc.That wasnt me.I wasnt the one who decided we needed to try to harvest with or without a crew.Then who was?Kari.Marc blinked with surprise.What?I was ready to give up.She wasnt.I found out the rain was coming, and I just sat there like an idiot.Shes the one who kicked everything into action.If not for her, the crop would have been ruined.Marc would have liked to have said he was surprised, but was he really?That little piece of dandelion fluff was tougher than he ever gave her credit for.Youve always made the hard decisions, Daniel said.Ive always depended on you for that, mostly because youre always right.So Im going to listen to you from now on.Do things your way.Im going to run this place the way it should be run, the way its always been run.We had a deal, and by God, Im going to live up to my end of the bargain.No, youre not.Daniel blinked.What?This isnt the place for you.It never was.What are you talking about?You can leave Rainbow Valley anytime youre ready.Because Im staying.Daniel shook his head, as if Marcs words didnt compute.Wait a minute.I dont get this.You spend years telling me you want out of here, and now suddenly you dont?Marc reached into the bag hed taken on his trip.He pulled out the ultrasound photo and tossed it on the table in front of Daniel.Whats this?Daniel asked, and then his eyes grew wide.He flicked his gaze to Marc.Dude.You gotta be kidding me.Im going to be a father again.Daniels face fell.Oh, crap.No.This is good.Good?How can it be good?I thought you were gung ho about getting off the daddy track.I was.He took the photo from Daniel and looked at it again, and he couldnt stop the smile that crossed his lips.Then I met Kari.So youre staying in Rainbow Valley?Uh huh.And Kari is, too?Yep.Thats what you want?To stay here and raise a baby?Thats what I want.Daniel shook his head.Holy crap.I sure didnt expect this.You must really be crazy about her.You have no idea.Well, thank God shes staying.Youre not nearly as much of a stick in the mud when shes around.Marc shook his head.Im so glad to be getting rid of you.Daniel grinned.Ill be coming back just to irritate you.And to see my newniece?Nephew?Too soon to tell.This is crazy, Daniel said.So have you told Angela?Not yet.How do you suppose shes going to feel about this?I dont know.We havent had a chance to talk yet.Im sure shes upstairs asleep by now.So hows she feeling about college?As far as I know, shes still there.And if I have anything to say about it, shell stay there.So that means my finances are going to be pretty tight for some time to come.For Gods sake, Marc!I told you I could fix that problem.Pay her tuition.But if you refuse to even consider  Thanks for the offer.I accept.Daniel looked at him with surprise.Seriously?Seriously.A smile lit Daniels face.Ill transfer the money first thing in the morning.How much?Twenty grand?Fifty?I havent kept up with college tuition, so I have no idea  Shell likely end up in vet school.That alone will be at least one Porsche.Sorry you offered?Nope.Ill make it a hundred.We can work it out later.And if thats not enough  Will you shut up?I told you we can work it out later.Daniel gave him a satisfied smile.Im going to hold you to that.He rose from his chair.Im heading to the cottage.Dont wake me for the next two days.Nope.We have some cleanup work to do tomorrow.I thought you said I could leave whenever I was ready.Thats right.And youre not ready.Thats funny.I swore I was.He sighed.Fine.Ill be there.He was halfway out the door when Marc called out to him, Just so youll know, the condoms in the dresser are expired.Dont use them unless youre ready to be a father.Daniel winced.Thanks for the heads up.Ill be burning those in the morning.As Daniel left the house, Marc headed for his bedroom to take a quick shower.Then he climbed into bed beside Kari and gave her a gentle kiss.She stirred a little, then was still again.She was a mess from head to toe, but he didnt care about that.All he cared about was that she was warm and safe and their baby was, too, and that all of them were home to stay.The next morning, Marc left Kari sleeping and went to the kitchen, where he found Sasha on her refrigerator perch and Angela starting a pot of coffee.She wore a pair of cotton pajama pants with kittens all over them and a ragged Rainbow Valley Animal Shelter T shirt.With her dark hair tucked behind her ears, bare feet, and sleepy eyes, he could almost make himself believe she was still only ten years old.Is Aunt Nina still asleep?Marc asked.Yeah.Shes sleeping just fine.And if she didnt snore like a freight train, I probably would be, too.Marc smiled.When did you start drinking coffee?Since I started pulling all nighters to study for tests.UT is a little harder than Rainbow Valley High.She grabbed another cup from the cabinet and set it on the counter, and they stood by, waiting for the coffee to brew.Speaking of college, Angela said, I need to talk to you about that.Angela  Dad  No, listen to me, he said.Your problems at UT will pass.Youre too smart and too nice to be without friends for long.There are fifty thousand kids there.There are bound to be at least a few you fit in with.No.I dont want to stay there.Youre just not thinking this through.No.I have thought about it.I dont like it there.Its just so big.It seems like there are more kids in my freshman chemistry class than live in this whole town.She sighed.Dad, I just cant do it.Marc felt the most profound sense of disappointment.Hed always seen college as the pinnaclethe thing he was supposed to shoot for with his daughter.And now she was telling him she didnt want what hed struggled so hard for her to have.But what was he going to do?Demand that she do something she hated?He sighed.Okay.If thats the way you feel about it.I dont want you to be miserable.But Ive been checking into something else.What?Now, dont freak out when I tell you this.I wont freak out, he said, knowing it was still a distinct possibility.I was thinking maybe Id go to junior college for two years.Junior college?Now, just listen, okay?Theres one in Waymark.Its a lot smaller than UT.I can get a two year degree as a vet tech.Then if I decide I want to transfer to UT and get my pre vet classes, what better thing to have?But if I decide to stop, at least Ill have a degree with a skill thatll translate into getting a job in a field I already know I like.Marc blinked with surprise.That actually made sense.I can either get an apartment in Waymark, or I can live here and commute.Angela took a deep breath and let it out.So what do you think?Are you sure you wouldnt rather transfer to another four year college?That would probably mean moving to Dallas or Houston, and theyre even farther away from Rainbow Valley.Most kids your age cant wait to get away.I know.Maybe Ill feel that way some day.But for now, she said with a shrug, I think Id like to stick close to home.As disappointed as Marc had felt before, that was how good he felt now.He couldnt say he hated the thought of having his daughter around a little longer.I think thats a really good solution.How did you come up with that?You taught me to take care of my own problems, didnt you?So you were actually listening all that time?Like Ive ever been able to tune you out?Kari had been right.Things really did have a way of working themselves out.Wheres Kari?Angela asked.Still asleep.I dont doubt it.She worked really hard yesterday.You look a little tired yourself.Yeah, but Ive done it before.She hasnt.Most people would quit after fifteen minutes, but she didnt.Angela sighed.Im sorry I treated her the way I did.Its just weird for me.You know.The two of you.She paused, staring at her hands.The coffeepot hissed and gurgled.Then she looked up.Do you love her?The question hung in the air for several seconds while Marc made sure he could answer without his voice choking up.It was official.Kari had turned him into a total sap, and he didnt even care.Yeah, he said.I do.Okay.If she makes you happy, she makes me happy.Marc was ecstatic to hear those words.Im glad youve decided you like her.I never really didnt like her.Ive just never had to share you with anybody.That takes a little getting used to, you know?I know.So I hate to tell you that the sharing thing is getting ready to happen again.Angela blinked.What do you mean?Theres a reason Kari is so worn out.She hasnt been feeling too well lately.Is she sick?Not exactly.Marc took a breath.How do you feel about becoming a big sister?She looked at him dumbly.Then all at once a look of total disbelief came over her face.A baby?Thats the deal?You guys are having a baby?Marc nodded.Is that why she looked so sick out there?I thought she just wasnt used to picking grapes.Nope.Morning sickness.But thats supposed to get better with time.So youre good with it?Angela said carefully.Its okay?Yeah, he said with a smile.Its okay.Oh, my God.I dont believe it!Wait.So does this mean youre staying in Rainbow Valley?Thats right.Are you really good with that?Thats okay, too?Thats okay, too.Angela squealed and leaped into his arms.He caught her midair and spun her around.As he set her down, she whispered, I love you, Dad, into his ear, and he whispered that he loved her, too.Kari appeared at the doorway.Still in Marcs arms, Angela turned around and smiled.Kari!Youre up.Dad told me about the baby.Karis smile slipped away.She flicked a questioning gaze to Marc.But before he could say anything, Angela held out her hand to Kari.Kari paused only a moment before hobbling over, and Marc enveloped both of them in a warm embrace.He figured Kari had never had a family hug, which probably explained why he could see her trying really hard not to cry.But sooner or later shed have to get used to it, because this was the way it was going to be from now on.He never intended to stop closing his arms around the people he loved.A few days later, Marc and Kari sat on the deck, watching as a stunning red orange sunset gave way to a star sprinkled sky.Sasha took up her perch on the windowsill, backlit by the kitchen light and sitting still as stone, looking like an Egyptian statue of a goddess in a cats body.Brandy followed Boo around the yard, wearing a doggy smile of total delight.The moon cast a warm glow across the empty vines, and Marc could already imagine what they were going to look like next fall, heavy with grapes that were bursting with juice.Its beautiful even without the grapes, Kari said.But I cant wait for spring.Neither could Marc.Spring was the season of new life.By then Kari would be only weeks away from having their baby.He couldnt wait.He was already a father, and he was damned good at it.But having Kari to share things with this time was going to change everything.He took a sip of wine, resisting the urge to pick up his phone and check the weather.Once harvest was over, it didnt matter so much.It wasnt until next season that he needed to be on alert again.Instead, he found his mind moving from one part of his life to another, one member of his family to another.Angela was going to work at the animal shelter until she began junior college in the spring, which Shannon and Luke were thrilled about.Tomorrow Daniel was hopping into his little red Porsche to go wherever life took him, probably straight down the road to his next million.Then Marc thought about Nina and felt a twinge of uneasiness.Im a little worried about Nina, he said.Dont be, Kari said.Shell be fine.Maybe.But she still misses Curtis.I wish I could do something.You dont have to do anything.Just be there in case she needs you.I like to be a little more proactive than that.You dont need to be.When you make somebody yours, they know they never have to worry about facing anything alone ever again.Nina.Daniel.Angela.Even if they never need you again, they can live their lives with all the confidence in the world.Why?Because youre their safety net.And mine, too.Kari slid her hand over his.Gus told me the good Lord was watching out for me by bringing me to your doorstep.There are angels on this earth, Marc.Youre one of them.Youre a big, handsome, hardheaded angel, and anybody would be better off for having known you.You dont even know how important you are to the people you love.He was finally figuring it out.But that wasnt the revelation that surprised him the most.What surprised him was how much he needed the feeling of being needed.It had worked its way inside him until it had become an inextricable part of who he was.When he thought about how ready hed been to walk away from all this, thinking hed find something better out there, it scared the hell out of him.You have a safety net, too, Kari said.I do?Her eyes glistened with tears.Yeah.Me.Marc turned his hand over and grasped hers, loving her more with every moment that passed.I can be there for you every day of your life, she told him.Pick up the slack when things get too hard for you.Ill never leave you, Marc.Never.Marc was living a dream he didnt even know he had inside him, a dream hed buried so deeply after Nicole left that it had taken until now for it to see the light of day.The dream of having a woman in his life, one who woke with him in the morning and went to bed with him at night, who brightened his life in ways he never could have imagined.Just seeing that mischievous look in her eyes when she dragged him to the bedroom, or watching her dance in the kitchen to that god awful music, or seeing that goofy pink streak in her hair made him feel as if he was young again, as if everything hed ever missed by becoming a father at age seventeen he was experiencing now.Kari blinked, and a tear rolled down her cheek.Am I yours?He leaned over and gave her a kiss, then brushed the tear from her face with his thumb.You were mine the moment you showed up at my door that stormy night.And because she was his, he figured it was about time the whole world knew it.You know Im not good at this stuff, he told her, so Ill get straight to the point.He reached into his pocket and pulled out a black velvet box.When he opened it and she saw the ring, her mouth fell open.I love you, Kari.I want you to live here with me from now on.Will you marry me?She opened her mouth to say something, but for some reason the words wouldnt come.Finally she just nodded, her lips tightening as if she really was going to cry.He slid the ring onto her finger.She turned her hand left and right, watching the ring glint in the moonlight.Then he took her hand, pulled her out of her chair, and settled her onto his lap.She circled her arms around his neck and kissed him, then laid her head on his shoulder.I hadnt felt it in so long, Kari said, her voice a near whisper.Not until I met you.What?Tears gathered in her eyes again.Loved.Kari meant more to him than he ever could have imagined.She filled in all his blanks.Made him laugh when he was too serious.Listened to his problems.Acted as an emotional bridge to the rest of his family, connecting his heart to theirs at times when he loved them so much but he just didnt know what to say or do.And now she was his forever.
