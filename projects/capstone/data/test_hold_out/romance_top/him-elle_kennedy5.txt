Instead, I walk around aimlessly for almost an hour, then plant my ass on a park bench and do some people watching.Canning is freaking out.I dont need to be a mind reader to know that.But fuck, I wish I could read his mind.I want to know just how badly I screwed up our friendship again.Or had I?I dont even fucking know.A part of me assumes that yes, Ive lost him again.But another part keeps saying, dude, he just gave you a MASSAGE.That means were still friends, right?Exceptdo friends really give each other back rubs?The one time I had a kink in my neck and asked Cassel to knead it out for me, he nearly bust a gut laughing.And speaking of Cassel, there are two text messages from him on my phone, both from earlier in the week.Ive been too busy settling back into the Lake Placid routine to answer him.I type a quick response: Camps good.Some real talent here.Hows ur sis?Make friends with any lobsters?I chuckle to myself.Cassels spending the summer with his older sister in Maine, busing tables at her seafood restaurant.He responds faster than I expect: All good here.Sis says hi.Theres a long delay, and then a second message pops up: Broke up with Em.Sitting there on the bench, I let out a whoop of joy.About fucking time.This is too important for texts, so I pull up his number and call him.He answers on the second ring, his familiar voice sliding into my ear.Yo.So howd she take it?I demand.As expected.Freaked out and slapped you, you mean?A heavy sigh echoes on the line.Pretty much.She accused me of stringing her along for four years.I reminded her we were only going out for one, and then she called me an insensitive fucktard and stormed out.Shit.Sorry, man.You doing okay?Oh yeah.Never realized how high maintenance that chick was until I set her loose.Just enjoying my freedom now, taking a page out of the Ryan Wesley playbook and screwing anything that walks.Next year that wont be my playbook.Hes silent for a second.You going to try to keep your extracurriculars on the DL?I think I have to keep it zipped up instead.A rookie cant afford rumors.At school That was just different.The stakes were lower.Yeah.I guess so.Sorry, man.Sounds lonely.I try to laugh it off.Sounds horny.Youd better have some fun this summer, before youre all famous and shit.Cassel laughs at his own humor.Ill get right on that.How is the pickup scene in Lake Placid?Cant imagine theres a gay bar there.Youll have to turn a jock or two.My stomach shimmies.If only I hadnt already tried that.Id better go, I say.Because Im really not fit for conversation today.Good talking to you, man.Stay strong if Em calls, I warn.Dont worry.He sighs.I will.19      Jamie      I glance at the door for the hundredth time in ten minutes.Just, you know, to make sure little gremlins didnt crawl out of some air vent and unlock it.But nope, still locked.It feels like Im doing something wrong.Like I just dipped my hand in the cookie jar when my mom turned her back to me.But maybe Im being too hard on myself.Theres nothing wrong with looking at porn.Im a red blooded, twenty two year old man.Im not a virgin.Im not a prude.Just a guy trying to figure out what his kinks are.Sighing, I lean back against the pillows, my laptop positioned on my thighs as I scroll through the thumbnails on the screen.I hover over one of the images, which shows a preview of what I can expect.All right.Seems okay.I click on the title: Hot jocks suck n fuck.Did I mention Im browsing gay porn?Yep, Im a filthy liarI told Wes I was taking a nap, and look at me now.A breath shudders out of my chest as the video loads.Its a short clip, and it starts splat in the middle of a scene from whatever movie the site pulled the clip from.Ive got the sound turned down low, but I can hear every word loud and clear.Well, just one of the dudes is talking.The other guy is only capable of wet slurps and deep moans as he goes to town on the first guys dick.Fuck yeahoh fuck yeahsuck that big cock  Okay, thats just cheesy.I laugh as I imagine myself ordering Wes to suck that big cock.Next clip.This ones not doing it for me.I click on something labeled Poolside fuck.Sounds promising.I like pools and I like fucking.Cant go wrong with that, right?You like that big dick in your hole, boy?Thats it, boy, take it  Annnnnnd I press stop.Nope.Just nope.I hit the jackpot on my next selection.Two very attractive guys are making out on a bed, grinding their hard cocks together.My dick says hello.Interesting.Theres something about the grip they have on each other that turns me on.Its not gentle.Theres a hungry, forceful energy to their kissing that I appreciate.That my dick appreciates.Shit, like seriously appreciates.Im hard now, my gaze fixed on the screen as I watch one guy kiss his way down the other ones stomach.When his mouth engulfs his partners erection, a jolt of heat shoots up my spine.Sucking in a breath, I reach down and grip my aching cock.Oh fuck, that feels good.I keep watching.Keep stroking.And the messed up thing is, Im not even mentally replacing the guys face with Wess.That had been one of the reasons for this little experiment, to find out if its just Wes who turns me on, or dudes in general.The guy receiving the blowjob releases a husky moan.The masculine sound of it does something to me.His partner sucks him harder.Im literally five seconds away from coming.Chillax, I order my dick.Were just getting started.But the little goalies got a mind of his own.He wont quit throbbing, so I hit the fast forward button to skip to the real test.The anal.And holy shit, thats some serious pounding.I wince as the sound of flesh slapping flesh bursts out of the laptop speakers.Jesus.How is that guy not screaming in pain?He is screaming, though.Well, moaning.And theres grunting.Theyre not careful with each other, but all that graceless enthusiasm looks like fun.I keep staring at the guy whos taking it.His biceps bulge as he jacks himself, his eyes slammed shut, his neck taut with pleasure.And then hes coming, and Im not far behind.The computer falls off my lap as I stroke faster, cupping my balls with my other hand.I gasp for air, my eyes glued to the screen, to the sight of two men screwing.My spine arches as my cock twitches in my hand, spilling all over my stomach.Holyshit.It takes almost a full minute for my heartbeat to regulate.Once my limbs no longer feel like spaghetti noodles, I reach for the tissue box next to me and clean myself up.Then I stare up at the ceiling for a while.Im not done, though.That was just the first part of the experiment.I pick up the laptop again and click on a new category.Good ol fashioned lesbian porn.Im too spent to jerk it again, but I still click on a thumbnail, one that shows two smoking hot brunettes tangled together on a white couch.I hike my shorts back up, one hand resting on my crotch as I settle in to enjoy the view.And enjoy it I do.Im hardening again.The lust isnt as strong as before, but thats because of the orgasm I just had, not because the girls arent doing it for me.They are.Big time.Their soft curves and pretty pussies and those sweet whimpers.Im attracted to women, no doubt about it.Im also attracted to men, apparently.Wonderful.Complicated fellow, my dick.When footsteps thud in the hall, I slap the laptop shut, nearly clipping my fingers off.Then I shove the computer aside and stand up, quickly tossing the used tissue in the wastebasket near the dresser.A second later, a key jingles in the lock and Wes strides through the door.He sees me standing in the middle of the room, lifts an eyebrow, and says, How was the nap?I get the feeling he knows exactly what Ive been up to, but I simply shrug.Just what I needed.How was lunch?Didnt have any.I ended up walking around.You hungry?I swipe my T shirt off the floor and throw it on.Cause I am.When my head pops through the neck hole of the shirt, I find Wes eyeing me warily.You okay, Canning?Yep.I walk to the door, glancing at him over my shoulder.Solunch?His brows knit, drawing my attention to the barbell in his left eyebrow.It gives him this whole bad boy vibe that makes me kindahorny.Wes?He snaps out of whatever thoughts had just preoccupied him.Uh, yeah.Lunch sounds good.I leave the room without checking if hes following me.I know he is.I can feel his perplexed gaze tickling my back.After the way I spent the afternoon, Im pretty sure hes nowhere near as perplexed as I am.20      Wes      We buy burritos and eat them by the lake.After that, we go for ice cream at one of the many places on Main Street.Jamie wants to talk about coaching, apparently.So we do.A lot of these kids still dont understand first touch, he theorizes.If there was one thing I could have em take back home, it would be that.In a high level game, you only get one chance at the puck.If they waste time repositioning, its over.Uh huh.But every time he says first touch my mind is on an entirely different kind of touching.Hes talking a lot with his hands, and Im fixated on his biceps, and the fine blond hair on his arms, which I now know is very soft to the touch.I think about removing that T shirt to kiss his chest, and my dick begins to grow heavy.Wearing these nylon athletic shorts?Not smart.And horniness isnt even my only problem.Last night Id asked Jamie if he was freaking out.Funny, Ive now spent an entire day doing just that.The guy is fucking with my mind.First he acts like nothing happened.Then he ditches me so he can take a nap.But no way was he doing that.I mean, I wasnt born yesterday.When I got back to our room and saw him standing there all guiltily, it was obvious what hed been doing.The fucker had jerked off.I would have been happy to help him out with that, but clearly hed rather go solo than let me touch him again.Exceptthen hed checked me out.Again, not born yesterday.I saw the way he was looking at me before we headed out.Jesus.Good thing hes not a traffic cop, because hes sending enough mixed signals to cause a ten car pileup.Ive played it cool, but inside Im a wreck.Because once was not enough, and yet I havent a clue what Jamies thinking.No clue.Shoving the last of my ice cream cone in my mouth, all I want is to drag him back to our lair and do very dirty things to him.But is that even in the cards?I know two things so far.First, Jamie Canning can get hot for me.I saw it last night.And second, hes not horrified by what we did.Thats amazing, and I feel like pinching myself that I had even one awesome night with the love of my life.But it doesnt guarantee me a fucking thing.He owes me nothing.He could tire of this little experiment.He probably already has.Its terrifying.Because I want another taste.Hell, I want to gorge myself on him.Im a glutton for Jamie Canning.Wes?What?Oh, shit.Ive been staring at him, and I have no idea what were talking about.I asked if you wanted to swim.Its still hot.Uh.I really just want to go home and get very, very naked.Im not wearing a suit.His eyes narrow.Who are you?Right.When you spend your life giving zero fucks about appropriate attire, people notice.Okay, I concede.Lets swim.Jamies phone makes a trilling noise.Oh.Hang on two minutes?If I dont answer, theyll keep calling.He swipes the screen, but holds the phone away from his body.Hey guys!A chorus of voices pours from his phone, which is on Skype or some shit.Jamie!Jamester!Hi baby!Id forgotten about this.Jamies whole family has a big meal together on Sunday every single week, and apparently its a family sacrilege to miss one.So while their youngest was away at camp, he got these calls every week.Probably when he was away at college, too.You need a haircut, a female voice pipes up.Yeah, he concedes, running a hand through his golden hair.Im jealous of that hand.Whats new in Cali?I listen while his family all tries to talk at once.Guess whos knocked up again?a male voice asks.Language!Apparently Jamies sister is pregnant again.And one of his brothers got a promotion.Another brother broke up with his long time girlfriend.Im sorry about that, Jamie says.Were not!a sister cries.Fuck off!Language!Suffice it to say that Jamies call from home is nothing like mine.So, son, an older voice booms.Jamies dad always manages to sound commanding without coming off like an asshole.My father could take a few pointers.What have you been up to this week?I snort so hard that Jamies eyes flick over to me before quickly moving back to the screen.The usual, he says, giving me a kick under the table.Lots of ice time.Went hiking.Sucked off my gay friend Wes.He keeps his eyes firmly on the screen so I cant really tell whether hes sweating this part of the conversation or not.Sounds good, his father rumbles.Your mother is busy in the kitchen, but she said to tell you to make sure you come home before you head for Detroit.Ill try, he promises.It depends on whether Pat can replace me for that week.Your mother also reminds you to try to get enough fiber and eat organic.Theres a boom of laughter from the phone at that.Jamie grins.Ill get right on it.Be good, Jamie!Love you!Wear your cup!More snickers.More endearments.And then Jamie ends the call, tucking his phone into his shirt pocket, shaking his head.Sorry about that.No big.Still want to swim?Please say no.Yeah.Lets do it.The town beach is at the southern end of Mirror Lake, really close to the dormitory.Everything in Lake Placid is close to everything else.This town was a summer resort for rich people well before it was a winter sports destination.So we pass all manner of attractive old buildings on the short walk to the little beach.Jamie kicks off his flip flops and strips off his shirt.He walks into the water, where his shorts start to cling to his body even before hes submerged himself.I follow him, of course.He could lead me anywhere right now, and I wouldnt argue.The cool water feels great, though.When Im up to my thighs I dive under, chasing Jamie out past the sandy area.Theres a floating raft a hundred yards out, and we swim to it.Jamie is smiling at me when I break the surface.With one palm I splash him a good one, then dive under again to escape retribution.Passing him, I make for the far side of the raft.When I come up to take a breath, a big hand pushes me under again.So of course Im coughing when I bob up a second later.Fucker, I sputter, even though we spent the better part of our summers trying to drown each other every afternoon after practice.Hes got an elbow on the raft now, too, which prevents me from dunking him.Figures.So I do the same, coming to perch beside him.Our shoulders are touching.All he has to do is turn his head and his mouth would be inches from mine.And then all Id have to do is lean forward and his mouth would be on mine.But he doesnt turn toward me.He just stares straight ahead.Fucking hell.I cant take this anymore.I need to know where we stand.Because the thought of spending even another minute guessing what this guy wants from me is absolute torture.Under water, I reach out and touch his belly with my fingertips.Jamies eyes widen.But he doesnt say anything.I hitch myself over to be a little closer.Then I flatten my palm on his cool, wet skin, my pinkie finger breaching the elastic of his shorts.I dont think anyone can see what Im doing.But Jamies eyes do a circuit of the lake.Hes worried.Fuck, I dont want to freak him out.Feel like going home now?I ask.Its code for, are we going to fool around again?If were not, I wish hed just tell me.Put me out of my misery.He licks his lips.Yeah, he says.Then he knocks my hand away.But cut that out, or I wont be able to get out of the water.I obey immediately.Five minutes later were walking into the dormitory, our clothes dripping on the old tile floors.But thats how people roll around here in the summertime.The place is mostly quiet, which means the kids are all at dinner.Without a word we walk into our room and shut the door.The first thing I do is drop my shorts and boxers to the floor where they make a wet slap.Jamie follows suit.Then were both just standing there, starkers, staring at each other.His eyes are startled, and my heart quakes with the fear that hes about to say, I cant do this again.We have to be quiet, he says instead.My smile is the size of Mirror Lake.You can bite the pillow when I make you scream.He takes a stuttering breath when I move closer to him, and I instantly freeze.Are you sure you wanna do this?I gnaw on the inside of my cheek.Youve kinda been running hot and cold on me all day.He nods.Needed to get some things straight in my head.I snort at his choice of words.Straight, huh?I offer a pointed look at his very noticeable hard on.His mouth twitches.My dick and I reached an understanding.Yeah?And whats that?I ask curiously.He shrugs.We both like you.Fuck yeah.I erase the rest of the distance between us.Im hardening already, which is no surprise, because Ive been thinking about this all day.My hands land on skin cool from the water.I brush his nipples with my fingertips, and they stiffen immediately.His ear is right beside my mouth, so I stick my tongue in it, making him gasp.Get on my fucking bed, I whisper.Two seconds later, hes there.And Im stretching out on him like a blanket, and jamming my tongue into his mouth.Jamie moans, but Im too wrapped up in the taste of him to worry about it.I have my fingers in his hair and his hot, hard body under mine and its everything Ive ever wanted.Hes not hating life, either.His hips roll beneath me, his cock bumping and scraping against mine.It aches.My balls are tight already.Rubbing off on him feels amazing, and I love that his sweet mouth is a prisoner of mine.But I dont want to come yet.So I force myself to pull back.When I look down at Jamie, his eyes are glazed with lust, and his lips are swollen and red.I make the sign for time out.He tips his head back into the pillow and sighs, and I cant help dipping down to kiss his exposed throat.I love you.The words are always right there on the tip of my naughty tongue.I swallow them back like I need to and say something much more practical instead.Have you ever been acquainted with your prostate?He shakes his head.Do you trust me?Jamie nods immediately, and my heart constricts.I must be insane to push him like this, but the things I crave are at war with my better judgment.So now Im getting off the bed to dig in my duffel for the bottle of lube I keep in there.His eyes follow the bottle when I sit back on the bed.Hes probably seconds away from saying, Hang on, thats just too gay for me.So I lean down and take the tip of his erection in my mouth.Fuck, he gasps, arching his back.Once again I am socked with the certainty that Im the worlds most manipulative bastard.But Im trying to blow his mind, and Im hoping thats enough justification.I torture him with my tongue until hes practically levitating off the bed.Lift this leg, I whisper.Drunk from my teasing, he hikes his knee without complaint, and I position him so I can reach his crease easily.I dribble some lube onto the fingers of one hand.Then I drop my head and take his cock in my mouth.When I start sucking, he gasps.But when I slide my fingers between his ass cheeks, he goes silent.For a moment I dont know what hes thinking.I release his dick and place a kiss on its tip.You okay?He takes a slow breath.Yeah, he says as I tease his hole.Its strange.Can you take more?If he says no, Ill drop it.Okay.I apply some more lube and then penetrate him with the tip of my finger.Relax for me, baby.He tries.So I reward him with some kisses right where he wants them.Mmm, he says.That I like.I give him some more.Since Ive weirded him out with the ass play, hes not teetering on the edge anymore.I lean down, sucking and licking and just generally bringing out my A game.And at the same time, Im working a finger slowly toward his prostate.When I finally get there, everything changes.Ohfuckohfuck, Jamie whispers, his thigh muscles trembling.I rub his prostate again and give another good suck.He moans, and I reach up with my free hand to cover his mouth.Shh, I remind him.Dont make me stop.He shakes my hand off his mouth.Its Youre My feet are tingling.Thats a good sign.Smiling, I resume my wicked ministrations, my finger sliding inside him in time to the long, lazy strokes of my mouth.Jamie begins to shift his hips, thrusting into my mouth.And its not just his dick hes thrusting.Its his ass, too.Hes bumping it toward me, seeking me out.Jesus.Hes trying to fuck my finger.You doing okay?I murmur.More than okay.His voice is a choked whisper.Hes squeezed his eyes shut.A flush rises in his cheeks, his brow drawn together as if hes in pain.But I know pain is the last thing hes feeling right now.His dick grows impossibly hard in my mouth, and I groan when his ass bears down on my finger.Wes He breathes out my name, his thighs quivering as he lifts his hips again.Youre making me crazy.Thats what I like to hear.His arousal surrounds us like a thick mist, pulsing in the air, in my cock.I slide the pad of my finger over his prostate again, and he croaks out a curse, and Im loving it.Has anyone ever told you before that youre sexually adventurous?One eye opens.All the time, he mumbles, and I experience a jolt of jealousy, wondering which lucky girl helped him discover it.Jamie groans again.Keep doing that.Pleasedont stop  This guy is under the impression that stopping is even an option.I would, of course, if he asked me to, but as long as hes begging for my mouth?For my finger?Nothing short of dying will stop me from giving it to him.Ill give him every fucking part of myself, serve it to him like a feast at a banquet.Jamie Canning has no idea the kind of power he has over me.21      Jamie      I thought I had sex down to a science.I mean, its not difficult.Kissing, foreplay, intercourse.Ive tried almost every sexual position known to man, even the crazy ones you see in porn, where the chick pulls some exorcist contortionist maneuver while I pound into her.But my ass was never part of the deal.Right now, it is the deal.Because even though Wess mouth engulfs my cock like its trying to swallow me whole, the arousal humming in my blood is centered solely on the pressure between my ass cheeks.Its good pressure.A slight burn that turns into a mind melting rush of pleasure each time he hits this one spot inside me.Hes destroying me.Hes bringing to life nerve endings I didnt know existed.Its unfamiliar.Its new.And experiencing it is a million times hotter than watching it happen to some other guy in a porn clip.So good, I choke out.Jesus, dont stopbaby.He called me that before and I test it out now.It feels weird leaving my mouth.As weird as the new sensations coursing through me and tingling in my ass.I wasnt sure Id like this, but I do.God, I do.When his tongue ring scrapes the underside of my dick, I shiver, my breath catching.His finger is lodged inside me, and I wonder what it would feel like if he slipped another one in there.Or if he used something other than a finger  I suddenly think of the porn I watched earlier, the husky moans of the guy who was being drilled, and the dirty memory makes me clamp harder around Wes.He lifts his head abruptly, his finger stilling but not withdrawing.Uneasiness circles my gut as I meet his eyes.Lust has darkened them to stormy silver, and his throat works as he swallows.Why did you stop?I swallow, too.Are you going tofuck me now?The question brings a jolt of panic.As hot as it was to watch on a screen, I dont think Im ready to experience that for myself yet.Im not sure Ill ever be ready  No.Hes quick to reassure me, his gaze softening when he sees my face.Not unless you want me to.I I bite my lip.Idont know.Maybe another time.Maybe another time?God, when I go gay, I really go gay.Wess lips quiver.Well put a pin in that.I shudder out a laugh.Whyd you stop then?Just wanted to do this, he says roughly, and then his finger disappears as he slides up and brushes his mouth over mine.The kiss goes from sweet to molten in a matter of seconds.His tongue fills my mouth in deep, hungry strokes that make me gasp.Im eager for more, desperate for it, but hes gone again before I can blink, crawling back between my legs.This time when his finger slips past that puckered ring of muscle, I welcome the burn.I crave it.Wes licks a hot line from the tip of my cock to my aching balls, teasing the delicate sac while his finger toys with me.When I try to push my ass against it, he retreats, a dark chuckle fanning over my shaft.Jesus.I cant take it anymore.I need to come before I self combust.Stop being a cocktease, I growl.Give me what I want.His tongue ring teases my slit.Yeah, and what do you want, baby?For you to suck me dry.Wes pushes his finger in deeper, rubbing that spot that makes me see stars.My prostate.Why hasnt anyone ever told me the prostate was some kind of magical pleasure zone?Are there unicorns and orgasm fairies dancing around in there?Ask me nicely and Ill consider it.He grins up at me.I narrow my eyes at him.Make me come, jackass.His laughter sends my heart soaring.Which is the most confusing thing of all, because it adds an element to the sex I didnt expect.Im comfortable with him.I have fun with him.Im not trying to impress anyone.Itseasy.Like splashing in the lake.But with orgasms.Youre a bossy bastard, Canning.His lips tickle the head of my cock.I fucking love it.And I love what hes doing to me.The sucking, the blunt fingertip rubbing inside me.Its not long before the tension gathers again.A knot of pleasure that coils tighter and tighter until finally I cup the back of Wess head and bear down on his finger as the orgasm shoots through me.Out of me.Wes drinks me up like he cant get enough, humming around my cock, and I have to tug on his hair to get him to stop once my dick has had enough.I lie there panting.When my breathing finally slows to an almost normal rate, Wes is straddling my thighs, his hard dick in two hands.He jacks himself slowly.My gaze rests on his erection, long and proud, the engorged head making my mouth water.Its the same response I have when a girl parts her legs for me, offering that sweet paradise to my mouth or dick.I never thought another guys package could look appealing too, and I really wish I knew what it meant.Nows not the time to dwell on it, though.Give it to me, I say roughly, beckoning to his erection.His eyebrows go up, the barbell catching the light.You feel like returning the favor?When I nod, he moves closer and straddles my shoulders, then grabs the second pillow on the bed and tucks it under my head.The added height brings my mouth to cock level.I swallow, then flick my tongue around the head.Im almost there, he admits.Yeah?I tip my gaze up, but keep my mouth on him, lightly scraping my teeth over his dick.A soft groan escapes his lips.I release him with a chuckle.Didnt we have a whole convo about stamina last night?That was before I spent twenty minutes fingering your ass.I shiver at the memory.Jesus, Im getting hard again.Its like I cant get enough of this guy.Turned you on, huh?I drawl.Oh yeah.He nudges his cockhead forward, and I open my mouth, letting him slide inside.My hands drift around his body to cup his ass.I squeeze and he groans again, pushing in a bit deeper.With my hands occupied, its hard to control how much of him I take, but hes not a jerk about it.He doesnt plunge deep and force any deep throat action on me.He seems to sense my limits, the same way he senses shit on the icewhen to pass the puck, when to take his time until that perfect opening reveals itself so he can slap one in.He fucks my mouth in fast, shallow strokes that match his fast, shallow breathing.I taste his pre come on my tongue.Its a heady flavor that makes me wonder how it would feel flooding my mouth, sliding down my throat.Never in a million years did I think Id be contemplating that.Or that Id be kneading another mans ass cheeks, urging him to orgasm while I clamp my lips around his dick.Coming, he warns.I stick with him until the end this time.The first hot spurt hits my tongue, the second goes to the back of my throat, triggering my gag reflex.I breathe through my nose and swallow, my heart pounding as my best friend gasps through the orgasm.That wasntbad.The taste of him is strangely appealing.I indulge in one more lick before allowing him to pull out.He collapses beside me, his head resting on my shoulder.We both release a sated sigh, then laugh.Silence stretches between us, but its not an awkward one.Were both relaxed.My mind drifts in a post sex haze, where thinking is overrated.We should probably head to the dining hall before dinner ends, Wes says.Dont want to miss the big show.Right.The song.Someoneahem, Weshad decided the coaches should serenade the kids with some good ol Britney Spears.Pat had griped and complained, claiming he didnt know the words to any of her songs.Wes, of course, had promptly whipped out his phone and emailed the older coaches the lyrics to Britneys entire catalogue.Very resourceful, my best friend.Im too relaxed to move, though.Five more minutes, I tell him, wrapping my arm around his shoulders to prevent him from getting up.His cheek nuzzles my left pec.Youre a cuddle whore, huh?I am.Absolutely.Just never dreamed Id be cuddling with another guy.I watched porn earlier, I blurt out.He snickers.Yeah, I figured.You had that guilty, I just tugged one out look when I walked in.I pause.Gay porn.He tilts his head up to look at me, his gray eyes twinkling playfully.Uh huh.I see.Did you enjoy it?Another pause.Then I puff out a breath.Yeah.Wes lowers his head again, rubbing a soothing hand over my stomach.Freaked you out, huh?Well Its not easy to explain.Im a little freaked out about not being freaked out.If that makes sense.We go silent again.I can tell hes absorbing what I just told him.Can I ask you something?I murmur.Hit me.His breath tickles my nipple, and it hardens.Instantly.Have you ever Im not sure how to phrase it.Bottomed?Is that the right word?His shoulders tremble as if hes trying not to laugh.As good a word as any.Been fucked also works.Taken it up the ass, also a goodie.Okay.Well?He shifts a bit.Yeah.I have.Once.Just once?I guess Im not surprised.Wes has top written all over him.Did you like it?He considers it.Not at the beginning.And definitely not at the end.But it was pretty good in the middle.Classic Wes answer.I burst out laughing, my palm sliding over his bare arm before I give his biceps a pinch.Umwhat happened at the beginning and end?The beginning, it hurt.His tone is rueful.But thats probably cause we were both eighteen year old morons and neither one of us thought to bring lube.Eighteen.For some reason that makes me bristle.I wonder if it was before or after our last night at camp.Before, Id be okay with.But after Not sure why, but the thought of Wes cutting me out of his life and then going off to lose his virginity to some dude pisses me off.Spitll only get you so far, hes saying, oblivious to my turbulent thoughts.So it took a while for him toyeah.I force a casual tone.But then it got good?He pauses again.Then nods, his chin bumping my shoulder.Yeah, it got good.A hot rush travels up my spine.Im stunned to realize its jealousy.And at the end?I prompt, in the hopes that hearing how the sex got sucky again will ease the tightness in my chest.Wes sighs.He wasnt anyone I need to see again.He got off on making it degrading for me.Kind of soured me on the whole experience.I stroke the top of his head.I can tell he feels awkward talking about it, but I appreciate that he told me.Its rare for Wes to shed his fuck the world attitude and let himself be vulnerable.So that was it?You didnt let anyone elseuhstick their flag in there after that?He chokes out a laugh.Nope.I decided Id leave the flag sticking to me.I chuckle, stroking his hair again.Its silky soft beneath my palm, a contrast to the stubble scraping my shoulder.I He clears his throat.Id let you do it, though.My hand freezes in his hair.You would?Wes nods.Id let you do anything to me, Canning.When his voice cracks, something inside of me does, too.I have no clue whats going on here or what we are to each other.Friends.Were friends.Except that doesnt feel like the right label.Friends with benefits?Doesnt feel right, either.I must have stayed silent for way too long, because Wes suddenly sits up, the warmth of his body abandoning me.Come on, he says gruffly.We should get going.22      Wes      Our coaching schedule picks right back up again the next morning, and I hit the ice ready to coach the hell out of these kids.I had a rough start last week, letting their hot headedness and inability to follow my instructions get to me, but Im determined to take a page out of Jamies book and exercise some patience.Dont get me wrong, I know how to be patientwhen Im playing.But watching other guys play?Seeing the mistakes theyre making and then watching them make them all over again instead of correcting them based on my advice?Its maddening.The kids are listening better today, though.Im running some basic passing drills with my forwards, switching up the lines every so often to let them get a feel for their teammates style and technique.For the most part, its going okay, but one kidDavieshogs the puck no matter what line hes playing on.I blow my whistle, tempted to rip my hair out by the roots.Davies has just ignored my instructions again, snapping a weak wrist shot at Killfeather instead of passing back to Shen like he was supposed to.I call him over, and he skates up to me, red faced and surly.From the corner of my eye, I see Jamie watching us carefully, as if hes assessing my coaching prowess.Pats watching too, from the bench, and Im gratified to see hes finally quit scowling at me.Last night Canning and I had shown up too late at the dining hall to catch the live performance, but luckily, Georgie filmed it on his iPhone.And trust me, Im never going to forget the sight of Pat and his four coaches shuffling around and singing the most off key rendition of Oops, I Did It Again.I dont think Pat will forget it, either.Or stop hating me for choosing the stakes of that soccer game.Focusing on Davies, I cross my arms over the front of my Northern Mass hoodie and ask, What kind of drill are we running?Um?Passing, I clarify.He nods.Right.Which means you need to pass the puck, kid.But last practice you gave us that whole speech about not hesitating.You said if you have a shot, you take it.His chin juts out defensively.I had a shot.I mock gasp.Waitthe puck made it past Killfeather?I mustve missed that goal.His expression goes sheepish now.Well, naw, I missed, but  But you wanted to score.I get it.I offer a gentle smile.Look, Im with you, kid.Theres no sweeter feeling in the world than watching that lamp light up.But lemme ask you somethinghow many forwards are usually on the ice?Three  Three, I confirm.Youre not playing alone out there.Youve got your teammates with you, and its not so they can skate there and look pretty.He cracks a smile.Shen had a shot.If youd passed to him, he wouldve one timed that baby right in, top left corner.And you wouldve gotten the assist.Instead, you got nothing.Davies nods slowly, and a burst of pride goes off inside me.Holy fuck, Im reaching him.I can see him absorbing the wordsmy wordsand suddenly I understand why Canning has such a hard on for this coaching thing.Itsrewarding.You need to trust your teammates, I tell Davies.But for some reason, that wipes the smile off his face, a dark scowl taking its place.What is it?I ask.He mumbles something I cant make out.Cant hear you, kid.He meets my eyes.Its kinda hard to trust them when I know they want me to fail.Thats not true.Except even as I voice the protest, I know on some level hes right.Some players do have the tendency to be cutthroat, to only look out for themselves.It suddenly makes sense why Davies is always looking to be the starbecause he thinks thats what everyone else is doing.It is true.His gaze strays toward the net, where Jamie is talking to Killfeather.Especially with Mark.He fucfrickin, he corrects.He frickin loves watching me screw up.And then he lists everything I did wrong the next day at breakfast, or dinner, or when Im trying to fall asleep.Hes all about the mind games.I stifle a sigh.Youre roommates, right?Unfortunately, he mutters.You guys ever hang out outside of practice?Talk about something other than hockey?Not really, he says with a shrug.I mean, he talks about his dad sometimes.I dont think they get along.But thats pretty much it.You want my advice?His expression is earnest as he nods again.Try getting to know him.Develop some trust off the ice.I jerk my head toward Jamie.The first day I faced off against Jamieuh, Coach Canning, I meanI was a total a hole.Cocky, full of myself.I taunted him every time I took a shot at goal, did a little victory dance every time I scored.I swear, he wanted to murder me by the time practice was over.He told Coach Pat he hated my guts and suggested they send me back to whatever jackass planet I came from.Davies snickers.But you guys are bros now.Yup.And we were roommates back then, too.We were in our room after that first practice and he just sat there glaring at me for a good hour.So whatd you do?Davies asks curiously.I suggested we play a game of I Never.Took a while to convince himhe was still pretty annoyed with mebut I wore him down eventually.I smile at the memory.Wed passed around some cans of Red Bull Id stolen from one of the coaches and gotten to know each other by saying the craziest things.I never pissed my pants at a Bruins game.I never mooned a bus full of nuns during a school trip to a gum factory.Those were mine, of course.Jamies had been more seriousIm not an only child.I dont want to play for the pros one day.Yeah, he hadnt quite mastered the never part of the game, but I hadnt minded.My thirteen year old self was having too much fun getting hopped up on sugar and caffeine.We stayed awake until four a. m.  and could barely get up the next morning.After that, we were inseparable, I say with a chuckle.Davies chews on his lip.But Coach Canning is cool.Mark iskind of a dick.I swallow a laugh.You never know, he might end up being the coolest guy youve ever met.I dont know  I give him a good natured slap on the shoulder.Just give him a chance.Or dont.Do with that advice what you will.Then I snap into Coach Wesley mode, blowing my whistle loud enough to make him jump.Now get back out there and share the wealth, kid.Hog the puck one more time and Ill bench you for the rest of the practice.The week goes fast.When Jamie and I were teenagers, everything took forever.A summer was a lifetime.But Im already two weeks into my six week stay in Lake Placid, and I cant figure out where the time went.After dinner with the kids on Friday night, Jamie and I have dorm duty.That just means counting heads and yelling lights out when ten oclock comes.Then yelling it again when they fail to follow through.By eleven its totally quiet.Jamie is lying on his bed texting someone.And I dont like it.Not at all.So I climb onto his body, straddling his ass, my chest to his shoulders.Hi.Hi, he says without looking up.I drop my nose into his hair and take a deep breath of him.He smells like summertime, and I cant get enough.Dude, are you sniffing my head?Just checking to see if you were paying attention.Mhm, he says, tapping away on his phone.I settle in a little further, my dick waking up to the fact that Im this close to Jamies ass.Funny how he thinks its weird when I sniff his hair, but hes perfectly fine that Im about two seconds from dry humping his backside.Times they are a changin.Weve been going at it every night like puck bunnies in heat this week.Pinch me.Its like a blowjob relay race around here.And weve gotten really good at passing the baton.But my favorite thing is just to make out while we rub off.Kissing Jamie Canning is mind blowing.Im greedy for it, because I know in my gut it wont last.The summer ends for me in four weeks, and Jamies interest in me may be even shorter.So Ill take all I can get.Its one hundred percent honest to say Ive never been happier.But of course I cant say it aloud.Trouble is, its harder every day to express any of the fuck it all attitude Im famous for.And Im not going to look over his shoulder and read the text.That would be an asshole thing to do, right?I look.The screen says HOLLY.The next instant I feel a fucking tsunami of jealousy.You want to go to a movie?Except I dont want to go to a movie, and theyve probably started already.Whats at the theater this week, anyway?I ask.As if I care.Id rather get naked and make out.A chick flick and a kids movie, he says.I checked.Bummer.Blowjobs, then?He snickers.But hes still holding that goddamned phone.Im not saying a word, though.Right.Whatcha doing?Texting Holly.I cant help iteven the sound of her name on his lips tenses me up.The first and only time I met the girl, she had sex tousled hair and a dreamy smile on her face.It bothers me that Jamie was responsible for both of those things.Whats she up to?I try to sound casual.I fail, because he turns his head to roll his eyes at me.Is that your way of asking if were sexting?I shrug.Jamie starts tapping on the phone again.Were not sexting.We dont do that anymore, by the way.And tonight shes stuck babysitting her little cousins on Cape Cod.They keep watching the same movie over and over again, and shes about to quit the family and join a traveling circus.He turns to smile at me.I suggested fire eating, but she thinks trapeze would be fun.He stops talking, those brown eyes holding a hint of amusement.I think hes this close to calling me on my dickish behavior.Then he doesnt.Fucking Jamie.Always so easygoing.Some days Id give up a limb to be more like that.But not a leg, because I need those for skating.And not my arms God, Im stuck inside my head tonight.Do I need a blowjob or what?Jamie reads the screen again and chuckles, and I want to grab the phone and bash it against the wall.The only thing holding me back is the fact that Cape Cod is like five hours away from here.Maybe six.So I start kissing his neck instead.Thats something Holly cant do.After a while, it works.He sets the phone down and drops his head onto the pillow.You feel good up there.Yeah?I thrust my hips downward and feel him pushing back at me.I slip a hand under his T shirt, stroking his side.Then I work the shirt upward and kiss his back, and he flattens under my touch, his body lazily shifting on the bed.Want you, I whisper.
