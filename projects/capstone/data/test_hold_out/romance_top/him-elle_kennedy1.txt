   APRIL      Wes   The coffee shop line is a little long, but I know Ill make it to the rink on time.Some weeks just click.Over the weekend, my hockey team clinched the first two rounds of the NCAA playoffs, and now were headed to the Frozen Four.I somehow got a B minus on a history paper I wrote in an exhaustion induced coma.And my spidey sense tells me the guy in front of me wont order a complicated drink.I can tell from his clothes hes a simple man.Things are going my way right now.Im in the zone.My skates are sharp, and the ice is smooth.The line advances so Dull Guy can order.Small breakfast blend.Black.See that?Its my turn a minute later, but when I open my mouth to order, the young barista lets out a fangirl shriek.Omigod, Ryan Wesley!Congratulations!I dont know her.But the jacket Im wearing makes me a rock star, at least for this week.Thanks, doll.Could I please get a double espresso?Right away!She barks out my drink order to her colleague, adding, Make it snappy!Weve got a championship to win here!And wouldnt you know?She refuses my five dollar bill.I shove it in the tip jar, then haul my ass outside and head for the rink.Im in a stupendous fucking mood as I stroll into the screening room at the teams top notch facility on the Northern Mass campus.I love hockey.Fucking love it.Im heading for the pros in a few short months and I cant frickin wait.Ladies, I greet my teammates as I flop into my usual seat.The rows are set up in a semi circle facing the massive screen at the head of the room.The chairs are padded leather.Yup, Division I luxury at its finest.I shift my gaze to Landon, one of our freshman D men.Youre looking kinda green, man.I smirk.Does your tum tum still hurt?Landon flips me the finger, but its a half hearted gesture.He looks sick as hell, and Im not surprised.Last I saw him, he was sucking on a bottle of whiskey like he was trying to make it come.Dude, you should have seen him when we were walking home, a junior named Donovan pipes up.Stripped down to his tighty whities and trying to dry hump that statue in front of the south library.Everyone around us breaks out in laughter, including mebecause either Im wrong, or the statue in question happens to be a bronze horse.I call him Seabiscuit, but I think its just a memorial for some filthy rich alumnus who made the Olympics equestrian team a hundred years ago.You tried to ride Seabiscuit?I grin at the freshman.Red splotches rise in his cheeks.No, he says sullenly.Yes, Donovan corrects.The cackling continues, but Im now distracted by the smirk being aimed in my direction, courtesy of Shawn Cassel.I guess you could call Cassel my best friend.Of all my teammates, Im closest to him, and yeah, we chill outside hockey, but best friend isnt exactly a term I throw around often.Ive got friends.Ive got a shit ton of friends, actually.Can I honestly say any of them really know me?Probably not.But Cassel comes damn close.I roll my eyes at him.What?He shrugs.Landon isnt the only one who had a good time last night.Hes lowered his voice, but it doesnt really matter.Our teammates are too busy riding Landon about last nights horse shenanigans.Meaning?His mouth twitches.Meaning I saw you disappear with that meathead.You guys were still AWOL when Em finally dragged me home at two.I raise one eyebrow.Im not seeing the problem.Isnt one.Just didnt realize you were corrupting the straight ones now.Cassels the only guy on the team I ever discuss my sex life with.As the only gay hockey player I know, I walk a fine line.I mean, if someone brings it up, Im not gonna clam up and scurry into the closet, but I dont volunteer the information, either.Honestly, my sexual orientation is probably the worst kept secret on this team.The guys know.The coaches know.They just dont care.Cassel cares, but in a different way.He doesnt give a shit that I like to fuck dudes.Nope, what he cares about is me.Hes told me on more than one occasion that he thinks Im wasting my life moving from one anonymous encounter to another.Who says he was straight?I say mockingly.My buddy looks intrigued.Seriously?I arch a brow again, which makes him laugh.Truth is, I doubt the frat brother I hooked up with last night is gay.Bi curious, more like it, and I wont liethat was the appeal.Its easier to mess around with the ones who are gonna pretend you dont exist in the morning.One night of no strings fun, a BJ, a fuck, whatever their liquid courage allows them to try, and then they disappear.Act like they didnt spend the hours leading up to it eyeing my tats and picturing my mouth around their dicks.Like they didnt run their greedy hands all over my body and beg me to touch them.Hook ups with gay guys are potentially more complicated.They might want more.Like commitment.Promises Im unable to make.Wait, I demand when I register what hed said before.What do you mean Em dragged you home?Cassels jaw tightens.Exactly what it sounds like.She showed up at the frat house and dragged me out.His features relax, but only slightly.She was just worried about me, though.My cell died so I wasnt answering any of her texts.I say nothing.Ive given up on trying to get Cassel to see the light about that chick.I wouldve gotten trashed if she hadnt shown up.Souh, yeah, I guess it was cool of her to come get me before I got too wasted.I bite my tongue.Nope, not getting involved in the mans relationship.Just because Emily happens to be the clingiest, bitchiest, craziest chick Ive ever met doesnt give me the right to interfere.Besides, I know how she feels about me partying.I shouldnt have gone in the first place  Youre not fucking married, I blurt out.Shit.So much for keeping my mouth shut.Cassels expression goes stricken.I hastily backpedal.Sorry.Ahforget I said that.His cheeks hollow, jaw working as if hes grinding his molars to dust.No.I mean, shit.Youre right.Were not married.He mumbles something I cant make out.What?I saidnot yet, anyway.Not yet?I echo in horror.For fucks sake, man, please, please tell me you arent engaged to that girl.No, he says quickly.Then he lowers his voice again.But she keeps saying how she wants me to propose.Propose?The thought makes my skin crawl.Goddamn it, Im gonna be the best man at their wedding, I just know it.Is it possible to make a wedding toast without acknowledging the bride?Luckily, Coach OConnor marches into the room before this insane conversation with Cassel can make my mind spin any harder.The room falls silent at his entrance.Coach iscommanding.Nah.Make that terrifying.Six five, perpetual scowl, and a head he shaves not because hes balding, but because he just likes looking like a scary motherfucker.He starts off the meeting by reminding usone by onewhat each of us did wrong in practice yesterday.Which is completely unnecessary, because yesterdays criticism still burns in my gut.I screwed up one of the faceoff drills, dropped passes I had no business dropping, missed on goal when I had an easy shot.It was just one of those crappy practices where nothing goes right, and Ive already vowed to get my shit together when we hit the ice tomorrow.The post season is down to just two fateful games, which means I need to stay sharp.I need to be focused.Northern Mass hasnt won a Frozen Four championship in fifteen years, and as the leading scorer, Im determined to seal this victory before I graduate.All right, lets get to it, Coach announces after hes finished telling us how much we suck.Were starting with this Rainier Seattle game from last week.As a frozen image of a college arena fills the huge screen, one of our left wings wrinkles his forehead.Why are we starting with Rainier?Were playing North Dakota in the first round.Well focus on North Dakota next time.Rainier is the one that worries me.Coach touches the laptop on the desk and the image on the big screen unfreezes, the sound of the crowd echoing in the viewing room.If we meet these guys in the final, were in for a world of hurt, Coach says grimly.I want you to watch this goalie.The kids sharp as a hawk.We need to find his weakness and exploit it.My gaze focuses on the game in progress, resting on the black and orange uniformed goaltender manning the crease.Hes sharp, all right.Steady eyes assessing the field of play, his glove snapping shut as he stops the first goal slapped in his direction.Hes fast.Alert.Watch the way he controls this rebound, Coach orders as the opposing team takes another shot at goal.Fluid.Controlled.The longer I watch, the more uneasy I get.I cant explain it.I have no clue why the hairs on the back of my neck are tingling.But something about the goalie makes my instincts hum.He angles his body perfectly.Coach sounds thoughtful, impressed almost.Im impressed, too.I havent followed any of the west coast teams this season.I was too busy concentrating on the ones in our conference, studying the game tapes to find a way to beat them.But now that post season is underway, its time to assess the teams we might face in the championship if we make it to the final round.I keep watching.Keep studying.Damn it, I like the way he plays.No, I know the way he plays.Recognition dawns on me at the same moment Coach says, Kids name is  Jamie Canning.Jamie Canning.Hes a senior.Holy shit.Holy fucking shit.My body is no longer humming, but trembling.Ive known for a while that Canning goes to Rainier, but when I checked up on him last season I found out hed been relegated to backup goalie, replaced by some hotshot sophomore who was rumored to be unstoppable.When did Canning get the starting job back?I aint gonna lieI used to keep tabs on the guy.But I stopped once it started to feel like borderline stalking.I mean, theres no way he was keeping tabs on me, not after I torpedoed our friendship like an asshole.The memory of my selfish actions is like a fist to the gut.Fuck.Id been a terrible friend to him.A terrible person.It was so much easier to deal with the shame when Canning was thousands of miles away, but now  Dread crawls up my throat.Im going to see him in Boston during the tournament.Ill probably even face off against him.Its been nearly four years since Ive seen or spoken to the guy.What the hell will I even say to him?How do you apologize to someone for cutting them out of your life without so much as an explanation?His game is flawless, Coach is saying.No, not flawless.He retreats too quicklythat was always a problem for him, scrambling back to the net when a shooter approached the blue line, giving them a better angle to shoot from.And he was always too pad reliant, creating easy rebound opportunities for the offense.I have to bite my lip to keep from offering the information.It feelswrong, I guess.Telling my teammates about Cannings weaknesses.I should, though.I really should, because this is the Frozen fucking Four at stake here.Then again, its been years since I was on the ice with Canning.He could have tightened up his game since then.He might not even have those particular weaknesses anymore.I, on the other hand, do.I have the same damn weakness Ive always had.Its still there as I stare up at the big screen.As I watch Jamie Canning stop another dizzying slap shot.As I admire the grace and deadly precision with which he moves.My weakness is him.2      Jamie      Youre awfully quiet this morning, even for you.Hollys fingers drift down my back, ending their journey on my bare ass.Thinking deep thoughts about the Frozen Four?Yeah.And it isnt exactly a lie.I can guarantee that Fridays trip to Boston is in the forefront of two dozen other players minds this morning.And about a zillion fans.I have more than winning on my mind, though.Now that we were actually headed for the championship, it was time to come to terms with the idea that we might face Northern Mass.The star player of their team?None other than Ryan Wesley, my ex best friend.What is it, sweetie?Holly props herself up on an elbow to study me.She doesnt usually stay over, but last nights sex marathon had lasted until four a. m. , and I wouldve felt like an ass hustling her into a cab that late.Im not sure how I feel about having her curled up in bed beside me, though.Spectacular morning sex aside, her presence makes me uneasy.Ive never lied to Holly about what this isand what it isnt.But Ive had enough experience with chicks to know that when they agree to a friends with benefits arrangement, a part of them hopes one of those benefits will somehow be landing a boyfriend out of the deal.Jamie?she prompts.I push aside one set of troubling thoughts and replace them with another.Have you ever been fired by a friend?I hear myself ask.What?Likesomeone you worked for?She has wide blue eyes, which always take me seriously.I shake my head.No.The leading scorer on Northern Mass was my best friend in high school.And junior high, too.You know that hockey camp where I work in the summer?Elites?She nods.Yeah, good memory.Before I was a coach there, I was a camper.So was Wes.He was crazy.I chuckle to myself just picturing his scruffy face.The dude would do anything.Theres this toboggan chute in the center of townin the winter you can sled down onto the frozen lake.But in the summer its closed, with a twelve foot fence around it.Hes like, Dude, after lights out were climbing that thing.Holly massages my chest with one of her soft hands.Did you?Naturally.I was sure we were going to get busted and thrown out of camp.But nobody caught us.Wes was the only one smart enough to bring a towel to slide on, though.So I had burns on the backs of my thighs from sliding down that fucker.Holly grins.And I still wonder how many tourists had to delete the pictures they took of Mirror Lake.Whenever Wes saw a tourist lining up a shot, he would always drop his pants.Her grin turns into a giggle.He sounds like fun.He was.And then he wasnt.What happened?I fold my hands behind my head, trying to appear casual despite the wave of discomfort sliding down my spine.I dont know.We were always competitive.Our last summer he challenged me to a contest...I stop, because I never tell Holly the really personal stuff.I dont know what happened, exactly.He just cut off contact with me after that summer.He stopped responding to my texts.He justfired me.She kisses my neck.Sounds like youre still mad.I am, I surprise myself by saying.If youd asked me yesterday whether there was anything in my past that bothered me, I would have said no.But now that Ryan Wesley has parked his nutty ass back in my consciousness, Im all churned up again.Goddamn him.I really dont need this going into the toughest two games of my life.And now you have to play him, Holly muses.Its a lot of pressure.Shes rubbing my hip now.Im pretty sure she has some plans for the two of us involving a different kind of pressure.Shes looking for round two, but I dont have the time.Catching her hand in mine, I give it a quick kiss.Gotta get up.Sorry, babe.Were watching tape in twenty minutes.I swing my legs over the side of the bed and turn for an eyeful of Hollys curves.My friend with benefits is sexy as hell, and my dick gives a little twitch of gratitude for the fun we already had.Shame, Holly says, rolling onto her back invitingly.I dont have class until this afternoon.She runs her hands up her flat stomach and onto her tits.With her eyes locked on me, she gives her nipples a flick then licks her lips.My dick does not fail to notice.You are evil and I hate you.I grab my boxers off the floor and look away before I get all boned up again.She giggles.I dont like you at all, either.Uh huh.Keep telling yourself that.But then I clamp my lips together.Six weeks before graduation, its unwise to start even a playful conversation about how much Holly and I like each other.Were strictly casual, but lately shes been making noises about how much shell miss me next year.According to Holly, its only forty three miles from Detroit, where Ill be next year, to Ann Arbor, where shell be in med school.If she starts wondering aloud whether there are any apartments for rent halfway between those cities, I dont know what Im going to say.Yep.Not looking forward to that conversation.Sixty seconds later Im dressed and heading for the door.Are you cool letting yourself out?Yeah, its fine.Her laughter stops me before I can turn the knob.Not so fast, stud.Holly gets up to kiss me goodbye, and I make myself stand still for a second and return it.Later, I whisper.Its my standard goodbye.Today, though, I find myself wondering if there are other words shes waiting to hear.But when the door closes on her, my head is somewhere else already.I sling my backpack over one shoulder and slip out into a misty April morning.Five days from now Ill be on the east coast, trying to help my team clinch the national championship.Man, the Frozen Four is such a rushIve been once before.It was two years ago, and I was the backup goalie instead of the starter.I didnt play, and we didnt win.I like to think those two things are related.This time itll be different.Ill be waiting between the pipes, the last line of defense between the other teams offense and the trophy.Thats enough pressure to freak out even the chillest goalie in college sports.But the fact that the other teams star center is my ex best friend who abruptly stopped talking to me?That is whack.I meet a handful of my teammates on the sidewalk as we all approach the rink.Theyre laughing about somebodys antics on the bus last night, joking and shoving each other through the glass doors and into the gleaming hallway.Rainier did a massive rink renovation a few years ago.Its like a temple to hockey, with conference pennants and team photographs lining the walls.And thats just the public area.We pause in front of a locked door so that Terry, a junior forward, can swipe his ID past the laser eye.The light flashes green and we push through to the opulent training area.I havent said a word to anyone yet, but Ive never been as much of a smack talker as the rest of them, so nobody calls me on it.In the team kitchen, I pour myself a cup of coffee and grab a blueberry muffin off the tray.This place makes me feel like a spoiled brat, but its useful when Ive overslept.Ten minutes later were watching tape in the team video room, listening to Coach Wallaces analysis.Hes at the podium wearing a little mic that amplifies his voice all the way to the back row.But I cant hear him anyway.Im too busy watching Ryan Wesley dart across the ice.I see clip after clip of Wes passing through the line of defense like smoke, creating scoring opportunities out of nothing but ice shavings and quick wits.The number two offensive scorer in the nation, the kid has balls of steel, our coach admits grudgingly.And enough foot speed to make his opponents look like my ninety seven year old granny.Shot after unlikely shot flies into the net.Half the time the on screen Wes doesnt even have the good manners to look surprised.He just glides onward with the grace and ease of someone whod practically been born with steel blades under his feet.Like us, Northern Mass woulda made it to the finals last year, but they were hampered by injuries in the post season, Coach says.Theyre the team to beat  The footage is mesmerizing.Id first seen Wes skate the summer after seventh grade.At thirteen we all thought we were hot shit just for attending Elites, the world class hockey training camp in Lake Placid, New York.Hear us roarwe were the best of the ragtag players on our club teams back home.We were the kids to beat during pond hockey pick up games.We were mostly ridiculous.But even my punk ass junior high self could see that Wes was different.I was a little in awe of him from the first day of my first summer at Elites.Well, at least until I discovered what a cocky bastard he was.After that, I hated on him for a bit, but being assigned as roommates made it difficult to keep up my hatred.Six summers in a row, the best hockey I played was against the sharp eyed, steel wristed Ryan Wesley.I spent my days trying to keep up with his quick reflexes and his flying saucer slapshots.When practice was over, he was even more of a challenge.Want to race to the top of the climbing wall?Ask Wes.Need a partner in crime to help you break into the camp freezer after hours?Wes is your man.The town of Lake Placid probably heaved a sigh of relief each August when camp was through.Everyone could finally go back to living normal lives that didnt include seeing Wess bare ass in the lake every morning for his daily skinny dipping sesh.Ladies and gentlemen: Ryan Wesley.Coach drones on at the front of the room while Wes and his teammates do their magic on screen.The most fun I ever had at a rink was with him.Not that he never pissed me off.He did that hourly.But I can honestly look back on his challenges and taunts and see hed made me a better player.Except for the last challenge he issued.I never should have accepted that one.Last day, hed taunted me, skating backward faster than most of us could skate forward.Youre still afraid to take me on in another shootout, huh?Still whimpering over the last one.Bullshit.I wasnt afraid to lose to Wes.People usually did.But it was hard to shut out a shootout, and I already owed Wes a six pack of beer.Trouble was, my bank account was drained.As the last of six kids, sending me to this fancy camp was all my parents could do for me.My lawn mowing money had already been spent on ice cream and contraband.If I lost a bet, I couldnt repay.Wes skated a backward circle around me so fast that it reminded me of the Tasmanian Devil.Not for beer, he said, reading my thoughts.My flask is full of Jack, thanks to the beating I gave Cooper yesterday.So the prize can be something different.He let out an evil laugh.Like what?Knowing Wes, it would involve some sort of public display of ridiculousness.Loser sings the national anthem while hanging brain on the town dock.Or something.I set up a row of pucks and prepared to shoot them.Whack, went the first one, just missing Wes as he went by in a blur.I set up my next shot.Loser gives the winner a blowjob, he said just as I swung.I missed the fucking puck.Actually missed it.Wes cackled, skidding to a stop.Jesus Christ, the guy was good at fucking with my head.Youre hysterical.He stood there breathing hard from all that fast skating.Think you cant win?Shouldnt matter what the prize is if youre confident.My back felt sweaty all of a sudden.He had me in an impossible position, and he knew it.If I refused the challenge, he won.Yet if I accepted, he had me rattled before the first puck even flew my way.Id stood there like a moron, unsure what to do.You and your mind games, I muttered.Oh, Canning, Wes had chuckled.Hockey is ninety percent mind games.Ive been trying to teach you that for six years.Fine, Id said through clenched teeth.Youre on.Hed hooted through his facemask.You look terrified already.This is gonna be rich.Hes just fucking with you, Id told myself.I could win a shootout.Then Id turn the mind games back on himId refuse the prize, of course.But then I could hold the fact that he owed me a BJ over his head.For years.It was as if a cartoon light bulb went off over my head.Two could do mind games.Why had I never realized this before?Id lined up one more puck and shot it with great force right past Wess arrogant smile.This is going to be a piece of cake, I said.How about we have this shootout, wherein I kick your ass, right after lunch?Before the end of camp scrimmage?For the briefest moment his confidence slipped.Im sure I saw itthe sudden flash of holy shit.Perfect, he said eventually.Kay.I scooped up the last puck off the ice and flipped it in my glove.Then I skated away whistling, as if I didnt have a care in the world.That had been the last day of our friendship.And I never saw it coming.At the front of the room, a new reel is playing, this one highlighting North Dakotas offensive strategy.Coach is no longer thinking about Ryan Wesley.But I am.3      Wes      Bostons skyline comes into view from my bus window well before Im ready.Its a mere ninety minutes from Northern Mass to TD Garden.The Frozen Four is always played at a neutral rink, but if anyone has a home ice advantage this year, its me.Im from Boston, so playing in the Bruins arena is my childhood fantasy come to life.Apparently its my jackwad of a fathers fantasy, too.Not only is he pumped up to invite all his asshole colleagues to my game, he can look like a hero on the cheap.He only has to spring for a limo, not a charter flight.You know what I like best about this plan?Cassel asks from the seat next to me as he flips through the itinerary our team manager passed out.That this event is like the puck bunny world headquarters?He snorts.Okay, sure.But I was just going to say that theyre putting us up at a nice hotel, not some sleazepit off the interstate.True.Although the hotel, whatever it is, wont be nearly as grand as my familys Beacon Hill mansion a few miles away.Id never say that, though.Im not a snob, because I know opulence doesnt stamp out ignorance and unhappiness.Just ask my family.We spend the next half hour snarled in traffic, because thats just how it is in Boston.So its almost five oclock by the time were finally unloading the bus.The gear stays!our student manager shouts.Take only your luggage!We dont have to schlep our gear?Cassel yelps.Baby, Ive arrived.Get used to this treatment, Wes.He elbows me.Next year in Toronto youll probably have a personal assistant to carry your stick around for you.It feels superstitious to talk about my NHL contract before the Frozen Four.So I change the subject.Thats awesome, dude.I love it when another guy holds my stick.Teed that one up for you, didnt I?he asks as we grab our duffels off the sidewalk where the red faced driver has tossed them.Sure did.I let Cassel enter the revolving door first just so I can grab the door by its handle and trap him inside.Stuck now, Cassel twists around to give me the finger.When I dont let go, he turns away and reaches for his belt buckle, setting up to moon me and whatever slice of Boston happens to be walking past the hotel on a windy April Friday.I let up on the door and give it a shove, smacking him in the not yet bare ass.Ah, hockey players.You really cant take us anywhere.Then were in the shiny lobby.How does the bar look?I ask.Open, Cassel answers.Thats really all that matters.Truth.We find an out of the way place to stand while we wait for the team manager to sort out the hotel rooms.But its going to be a while.The lobby is busy and getting busier.Our end of the room has a distinctly green and white color scheme, with our Northern Mass jackets everywhere.But on the other end of the room another color catches my eye.Its orange.Specifically, the orange and black of another teams jackets.Theyre filing through the same doors we just entered, shoving each other and generally acting like testosterone hounds.Its all very familiar.And then the room tilts a little as my gaze locks onto a sandy blond head.I only need the oblique view Ive got to recognize the shape of his smile.Fuck me.Jamie Canning is staying at this hotel.My entire body tenses as I wait for him to turn his head.To look right at me.But he doesnt.Hes too engrossed in conversation with one of his teammates, laughing at something the guy has just said.He used to laugh with me that way.I havent forgotten the sound of Jamies laughter.Deep and husky, melodic in a carefree kind of way.Nothing ever kept Jamie Canning down.He was the epitome of go with the flow, probably because of his laidback California upbringing.I hadnt realized just how much Ive missed him until this very moment.Go talk to him.The voice in my head is persistent, but I silence it by wrenching my gaze off Canning.With the colossal amount of guilt lodged in my chest, its now become even more evident that I need to apologize to my old friend.But right this second Im not ready.Not here, with all these people around.Its fucking Grand Central Station in here, Cassel mutters.Dude.Theres an errand I need to run.Come with me?I form this idea on the fly, but its a good one.Sure?Back door, I say, nudging him toward a nearby exit.Outside, I realize how close we are to Faneuil Hall and all the touristy crap they sell there.Perfect.Cmon.I give Cassel a tug toward the first row of stores.Forgot your toothbrush?Nah.I gotta buy a gift.For who?Cassel hefts his duffel higher on his shoulder.I hesitate.Ive always kept my memories of Canning to myself.Because theyre mine.For six weeks every summer, he was mine.A friend, I finally admit.One of the Rainier players.A friend.Cassels chuckle is low and dirty.Trying to work out how to get laid after tomorrows game?What kind of store are you taking me to?Fucking Cassel.I should have left him in the crowded lobby.Dude.Its not like that.Even if I wish it were.This guyCanning, their goaliewe used to be tight.I reluctantly add, Until I wrecked it by being an ass.You?Who woulda guessed.I know, right?I scan the row of storefronts.Theyre full of the Boston tourist crap that is usually invisible to me: toy lobsters, Bruins pennants, Freedom Trail T shirts.Something here would definitely fit the bill for what I have in mind.Cmon.I wave Cassel into the cheesiest store and start scanning the shelves.Everything is garish as hell.I pick up a bobblehead doll of Paul Revere and then put it down.These are funny, Cassel says.Hes holding a box of Red Sox condoms.I laugh before I think better of the idea.True.But thats not what Im looking for.Whatever I choose, it cannot have anything to do with sex.We used to send each other all sorts of gag giftsthe dirtier the better.But not this time.May I help you?The sales girl is dressed in colonial garb, complete with the bosom squishing flouncy dress.Sure you can, doll.I lean against the counter in the cockiest way possible, and her eyes open a little wider.You got anything with kittens on it?Kittens?Cassel chokes back a laugh.What the hell for?His team is the tigers.Duh.Sure!Miss Betsy Ross perks up at the request, probably because this job is boring as fuck.One sec.Whats the deal?Cassel tosses the condoms down onto a table.You never buy me prezzies.Canning and I were summer camp friends.Tight, but we only saw each other for six weeks a year.A very intense six weeks.You have friends like that?Cassel shakes his head.Me neither.Not before, and not since.But we didnt speak during the year.We texted, and we sent the box.The box?Yeah I scratch my chin.I think it started on his birthday.He must have been turningfourteen?Christ.Were we ever that young?I sent him this obnoxious purple jock strap.I put it in one of my dads Cuban cigar boxes.I could still remember wrapping the box in brown paper and taping it all to hell so that it would get there in one piece.Id hoped hed open it in front of his friends and get embarrassed.Here we go!Betsy Ross returns to spread several things on the counter in front of me.Shes found a Hello Kitty pencil box, a big plush cat wearing a Bruins T shirt, and white boxers covered with kittens.These.I push the boxers to her.Underwear hadnt been my goal, but the kittens are even the right shade of orange.Now, for bonus points, I need a box.Cigar shaped, if possible.She hesitates.Gift boxes cost extra.Im good for it.I wink at her and she blushes a little.Shes checking out my tats where they peek from the V neck of my T shirt.Cant blame her.Most women do.Better yet, men like em, too.Let me see what I can find.She scurries off.I turn to Cassel, whos chewing his gum, watching me like Im not making sense.I still dont get it.Right.So, a couple of months later I get the box in the mail.No note.Its just the box I sent him but its filled to the top with purple Skittles.Gross.No, man.I fucking love purple Skittles.Took me a month to eat them, though.Thats a lot of Skittles.And eventually I sent the box back.With what?No idea.Dont remember.What?yelps Cassel.I thought this story had a punchline.Not so much.Huh.I didnt realize until right this second the gift inside wasnt that important.It was the act of sending it.Id been just like every teenage kid going through the grind of school and practice and homework, communicating only by email and text and grunts.When that box showed up unannounced it was like Christmas, but better.My friend had thought about me and gone to the trouble.As we got older, the jokes got even more ridiculous.Fake poop.Whoopie cushions.A sign that prohibited farting.Stress balls shaped like boobs.The gift wasnt nearly as important as the fact that something was given.Now Betsy Ross is back with a gift box thats roughly the right size, even if it doesnt flip open at the top like our box used to.That will do, I say, even though Im disappointed.So Cassel looks around the store, bored now.Youre sending him this one?Yeah.Our old one is probably at my house somewhere.If I werent an asshole, Id know where.I broke the chain a few years ago.So thisll have to do.Im gonna text the manager and see if hes got hotel keys for us yet, Cassel says.You do that.Im watching Betsy Ross wrap the kitty boxers in some tissue paper, then tuck them in the box.Need a card?she asks, flashing me a smile and a better view of her cleavage.Those dont work on me, sweetheart.Please.She passes me a sturdy square of cardstock and a pen.I write exactly one word on it and drop it into the box.There.Ill send this gift to Jamies room in the hotel as soon as we get back.Then, when I can pull him aside somewhere quiet, Ill apologize.Theres no way to undo the wreckage Id wrought four years ago.I cant take back that ridiculous bet Id forced on him or the very awkward result.If I could go back in time and restrain my stupid eighteen year old self from pulling that bullshit, I would do it in a heartbeat.But I cant.I can only man up and shake his hand and tell him its good to see him.I can look into those brown eyes that always killed me and apologize for being such a dick.And then I can buy him a drink and try to go back to sports and smack talk.Safe topics.The fact that hed been the first guy I ever loved and the one who made me face some terrifying things about myselfwell, all that will go unsaid.And then my team will kill his in the final.But thats just the way it is.4      Jamie      Were looking at a quiet night in the hotela fact Im sure half my teammates are extremely unhappy about.Particularly the freshmen and sophomore players, who are at the Frozen Four for the first time and were expecting to party like crazy this weekend.Coach squashed that notion pretty quick, though.He laid down the law before anyone could even pick up their menus at the team dinnerten oclock curfew, no alcohol, no drugs, no shenanigans.The upperclassmen know the drill, so none of us are especially bummed as we ride the elevator up to our block of rooms on the third floor.Tomorrow is game day.That means tonight is about taking it easy and getting some sleep.Terry and I were assigned room 343 near the stairwell, so were the last ones in the hallway as we head for our door.The moment we reach it, we freeze.Theres a box on the carpet.Pale blue.No wrapping except for a white notecard stuck to the top reading Jamie Canning in flowery cursive.What the shit?My first thought is that my mom shipped something from California, but if she had, thered be an address, postage, her handwriting.Um Terry shuffles before planting his hands on his hips.You think its a bomb?I snicker.I dont know.Go put your ear on it and tell me if you hear ticking.He snickers back.Uh huh, I see how it is.Such a great friend, Canning, putting me in the line of fire.Well, forget it.Thats your name on the fucking thing.We both stare at the package again.Its no bigger than a shoebox.Beside me, Terry scrunches his face in mock terror and wails out, Whats in the box?Dude, nice Seven reference, I say, genuinely impressed.He grins.You dont know how long Ive been waiting for an opportunity to do that.Years.We take a moment to high five each other, and I squat down and pick up the box because as entertaining as this convo is, we both know the thing is harmless.I tuck it under my arm and wait as Terry swipes his keycard to open the door, and then the two of us stride into the room.He flicks the light and heads for his bed, while I flop down on the edge of mine and lift the boxs lid.Wrinkling my forehead, I unwrap the white tissue paper and pull out the soft bundle of fabric inside.From across the room, Terry hoots.Dudewhat the fuck?I have no idea.Im staring at a pair of white boxers with bright orange kittens all over them, including an ill placed tabby right at the crotch.When I hold them up by the waistband, another card flutters out.This one has one word on it.MEOW.And holy shit, I recognize the handwriting this time.Ryan Wesley.I cant help it.I snort so loud it sends Terrys eyebrows soaring up his forehead.I ignore my friends reaction, too amused and bewildered by the significance of this gift.The box.Wes has resurrected our old joke box.Except for the life of me, I have no idea why.I had been the last one to send it.And I remember feeling pretty damn smug about my choice of giftsa package of Blow Pops.Because, well, how could I resist?Wes hadnt sent anything back.He also hadnt called, texted, snail mailed, or courier pigeoned.Not a single word from him for three and a half years.Until now.Whos it from?Terry is smirking at me, visibly entertained by the ridiculous gift in my hands.Holly.Her name leaves my mouth so smoothly it surprises me.I dont know why I lied.Easy enough to say the boxers are from an old friend, a rival, whatever.But for some reason, I cant bring myself to tell Terry the truth.Is this an inside joke or something?Why would she send you kitten boxers?Uh, you know, because she calls me kitten sometimes.Oh, for fucks sake.Terry pounces on that in a heartbeat.Kitten?Your girlfriend calls you kitten?Shes not my girlfriend.But the point is moot because hes doubled over in laughter, and I want to kick myself for giving him embarrassing ammo hell no doubt use against me until the end of time.I shouldve just told him it was from Wes.Why the hell didnt I?Uh, excuse me, he says, still chuckling as he marches to the door.I narrow my eyes.Where are you going?Dont worry about it, kitten.A sigh gets stuck in my throat.Youre going to knock on every door and tell the guys, arent you?Yup.Hes gone before I can protest, but honestly I dont care all that much.So the guys will ride me about the kitten thing for a few days.Eventually one of my teammates will do something ridiculous and itll be his turn to take the heat.After the door swings shut behind Terry, I stare at the boxers again, an unwitting smile reaching my lips.Fuckin Wes.Im not sure what this means, but he must know Im in town for the championship.Maybe this is his way of apologizing?Extending an olive branch?Either way, Im too curious to ignore the gesture.I reach for the phone and dial the front desk, then wait on the line to an awesome elevator rendition of Katy Perrys Roar.Which only makes me chuckle, because, you know, roar.Meow.When the desk clerk answers, I ask if theres a room number for Ryan Wesley.Im pretty sure the sea of green and white jackets in the lobby means hes at this hotel.I cant provide another guests room number, sir.That stops me for a second, because clearly Wes was able to learn my room number.But this is Wes were talking about.He probably offered some woman at the front desk a look at his abs.Sir?I could try to connect you by phone.Thanks.It rings, but nobody answers.Shit.But theres one more thing to try.I scroll through my phone to see if his number is still in my contacts.And it is.Guess I was never quite pissed off enough to delete him.I shoot him a text, just three words: still a smartass.When my phone chimes a second later, I expect it to say my message bounced.That Wes changed his number a long time ago, fuck you very much.Some things dont change, it says instead.I cant help answering him in my head.But some do.Eh.Listen to me getting all bitchy.Whats the point of that?So I tap out something else: So was this a hello present or a fuck you, loser, were gonna kick your ass present?His reply: Both?Sitting there on the hotel bed, Im grinning at my phone.Seriously, my face is about to crack in two.Its really just nostalgia for a simpler time in my life when the biggest decisions were pizza toppings and what bit of ridiculousness I should mail in a box to my buddy.But I like it anyway, which is probably why my next text says: Im probably heading down to the bar for a bit.His reply: Im already there.Of course he is.I pocket my phone and open my duffel.Heading into the shower, I take a few minutes to wash the long day off me.I need to regroup.And I could really use a shave.Or maybe Im stalling.I dont know what to expect from Wes.With him, you never know what to expect, which was one of the reasons I always liked him so much.Being his friend was a goddamn adventure.Hed drag me into one crazy situation after the other, and I was happy going along for the ride.I did that so loyally.Right up through the crazy part at the end.In the hotel shower, I take a deep breath of steamy air.Holly was right.I am still mad.Because if Wes and I had had a fight or something, then his turning his back on me would at least have made sense.But we hadnt fought.Hed just challenged me to a shootout.And that daythe second to last afternoon of campwed lined up the pucks with perfect fairness.He shot five times at me, I shot five times at him.Shootouts are never easy.But when youre defending the net against Ryan Wesley, the fastest skater Ive ever played with?Its intense.Still, wed done this often enough for me to be able to anticipate his flashy moves.I remember cackling after I stopped the first three shots.But then he got lucky, deking me once and then winning one on an unlikely bounce off the pipe.Maybe another guy would have panicked a little when he realized hed let in two.But I was a cool customer.Ultimately, it was Wes whod choked.He wasnt used to the goalie gear, but neither was I used to firing on goal.I sank my first two shots.Then he defended the next two.It was all down to one shot, and I saw itfear in his eyes.In my gut, I knew I could do this.Id won, fair and square.The third shot went past his elbow and landed with a swish in the back of the net.For the next three hours I let him twistall through dinner and the bullshit awards ceremony they held at the end of camp.Wes was uncharacteristically mute through all of it.I waited until we got back to our room to let him off the hook.Think Ill collect my prize next year, Id said with as much nonchalance as an eighteen year old can muster.June, maybe.Or July.Ill let you know, kay?Id wanted some kind of relieved gasp.Making Wes sweat for once had been fun.But his face gave nothing away.Hed pulled out a stainless steel flask and slowly unscrewed the top.Last night of camp, dude, hed said.Wed better celebrate.He took a good gulp and then passed it to me.When I took the flask, his eyes flashed with something I couldnt read.The whiskey was rough going down.The first swallow, anyway.Up until now, we hadnt drunk more than a beer or two, squirreled away in our footlockers.Getting caught with alcohol or drugs would have meant real trouble.So I didnt have any kind of tolerance back then.I felt the liquors warmth slide through my chest just as Wes said, Lets watch some porn.Almost four years later, I stand there shivering in a hotel bathroom.I shut the water off and grab a towel off the stack.I guess its time to go downstairs and see if our friendship is fixable.What had happened on that night was a little crazy, but not exactly worthy of the record books.Id shrugged it off easily enough.But Wes had not.Theres really no other explanation for why hed cut me loose.God, I hope he doesnt dredge that up.Sometimes its better to just let shit lie.The way I see it, one night of drunken stupidity shouldnt be the defining moment in a six year friendship.Even so, Im oddly nervous five minutes later as I ride the elevator downstairs, and I hate the itchy feeling in my spine, because I dont get nervous often.Im probably the most chill person youll ever meet, which Im sure has to do with the fact that my family is the walking definition of laidback Californians.The bar is packed when I enter.No surprise.Its Friday night and the hotel is booked solid because of the tournament.Every table and booth is occupied.I have to turn my body sideways to move through the place, and I cant see Wes anywhere.Maybe this was a stupid idea.Excuse me, I say.Theres a clot of businessmen blocking the thoroughfare between the bar and the tables.But they laugh at someones joke, ignoring the way theyre making the whole room impassable.Im probably seconds from going back upstairs when I hear it.Suckers.Its just one word, but I recognize Wess voice instantly.Deep, kinda raspy.Im suddenly transported back to high school, to all those summers I heard that voice mocking me, challenging me, ragging on me.A communal snort of laughter follows his comment, and I turn my head to search him out in the group of hockey players against the far wall.He turns his head at the same time, almost as if he senses my presence.And shit, Ive traveled back in time again.He looks the same.And different.He looks both different and the same.Hes still got the messy dark hair and scruffy beard growth, but hes bigger now.Solid muscle and broad shoulders, more lean than bulky, but definitely bulkier than his eighteen year old self.Still has the tribal tattoo on his right biceps, but now theres a lot more ink on his golden toned skin.Another piece on his left arm.Something black and Celtic looking peeking from the collar of his T shirt.Hes still talking to his friends as he watches me approach.Of course hes surrounded by people.Id forgotten how magnetic he is.As if he burns with higher test fuel than the rest of us.A barbell pierced through his eyebrow catches the light as he turns his head, a wink of silver just a shade lighter than his slate gray eyes.Which narrow when I finally swim through the sea of people to arrive at his side.Shit, man, did you get highlights in your hair?More than three years since weve been in the same room together, and thats the first thing he says to me?No.I roll my eyes as I slide onto the stool beside his.Its from the sun.Still surfing every weekend?Wes asks.When I have time.I cock a brow.Still pulling down your pants and flashing your junk for no conceivable reason?His teammates erupt around us, their laughter thundering in my chest.Shit, he was always like this?somebody says.A grin tugs the corner of Wes's mouth.Ive never deprived the world of my God given masculine beauty.He reaches out to put a big hand on my shoulder.He gives it a squeeze.Its gone again in a split second, but I can still feel the warm spot on my shoulder.
