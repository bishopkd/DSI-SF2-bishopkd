Of course.Were very compatible.The minister who married us said so, didnt he?Marc could tell Kari wasnt convinced, and Greg clearly wasnt happy that she didnt share his point of view.If youre worried about being embarrassed when you come back, Greg said, it wont be a problem.Your father and I covered for you.Covered for me?We told everybody you were sick.Kari drew back.You lied?Would you rather wed have told the truth?The truth?Do you even know what the truth is?You got cold feet.A lot of brides do.But why did I get cold feet?Did you stop to think about that?It doesnt matter, Greg said.Were getting married, and thats the end of it.Even at the distance Marc was away from them, he sensed the guys undercurrent of anger.Patient on the surface, pissed underneath.A tiny shiver skated between Marcs shoulders, telling him trouble was brewing.He stood up tall, watching intently as the guy inched closer to Kari.So heres whats going to happen, Greg went on.You and I are getting in my car, and were driving back to Houston.Then were going to the justice of the peace.Hes a friend of your fathers and very discreet.Were getting married.Then were going to send out announcements to everyone who showed up to the wedding that day, letting them know were man and wife.And then were going to pray your father overlooks the humiliation youve put him through.Kari swallowed so hard Marc could see her throat move at twenty paces.I dont care how my father feels about it.Really?Greg snapped.You dont care?Well, youd better care.See how far you get when you dont have your daddy to give you a job!I dont need that job, Kari said, her voice quivering.Ill get another one.Right.This economy stinks.If people with actual skills cant get a job, what hope do you have?Kari looked away, stroking her dog nervously.He pays you about twice what youre worth at a job that could be cut from that company tomorrow.Try to find another employer wholl do that.Kari was silent.Then Greg got a calculating look on his face.Tell me, Kari.Have you checked your bank account lately?She drew back.You know about that?Yes, he said smugly.I know about it.Still think youre staying here?I cant talk to you anymore right now.Kari started to walk away.Greg grabbed her arm and pulled her back around.Youre not going anywhere.She tried to pull her arm away.Greg, please!Let me go!He tightened his grip and gave her arm a hard jerk.Stop all this nonsense and get in the damned car!An alarm bell went off inside Marcs head.Words were one thing.A physical threat was another.He didnt tolerate that kind of behavior from a man toward a woman.Ever.He strode into the parlor.Hey!What do you think youre doing?Greg froze at the sound of Marcs voice, and Karis eyes went huge with surprise.Greg gradually let go of her arm.Who the hell are you?Forget the introductions.Just keep your hands off her.This is none of your business.You grab her arm like that again, and Im making it my business.He turned to Kari.Do you want to go with this guy?She looked at Greg, then at Jill, swallowing hard once again.No.I dont.Marc turned to Greg.Beat it.Shock spilled over Gregs face.Excuse me?You heard me.Get out of here.Greg turned to Kari.Who the hell is this guy?Hes a friend of mine, Kari said.You have friends in this dinky town?Yes, Marc snapped.She has friends in this dinky town.And if you touch her again, this friend is going to be all over you.Yeah?What are you going to do?You know the easiest way to find out?How?Grab her arm one more time.Greg turned to Kari.Are you going to let him talk to me like that?Kari flicked her gaze to Marc.Yeah, she told Greg.I think maybe I am.Gregs expression turned ugly.Gimme the ring.What?The ring!Give it to me!With an expression of disgust, Kari yanked the ring off her finger and slapped it into his palm.Sooner or later youre going to be sorry about this, Greg said.But then its going to be too damned late!He spun around and stormed out of the parlor.Jill watched him leave, then turned to Kari.What the hell do you think youre doing?Kari drew back with surprise.What am I doing?How can you turn your back on Greg?How?Hes smart, hes handsome  Didnt you hear the things he said to me?Of course he said those things!Hes angry!You would be, too, if hed humiliated you in front of three hundred people!Im sorry about that, Kari said.I really am.But I just didnt see another way out.If I had stayed, everybody would have talked me into getting married.But I cant marry Greg.He doesnt love me.Doesnt love you?He gave you that big, beautiful diamond ring, didnt he?Kari was silent.And you gave it back to him.I cant believe you gave it back to him!And he bought that gorgeous condo for you, too.What does that tell you?He didnt ask me how I felt about it.He just bought it.Well, I sure wouldnt mind if a guy surprised me with an incredible place like that.Kari winced.Im not really all that crazy about it.Not crazy about it?Jill threw her hands up.Have you completely lost your mind?All that stuff Kari exhaled.It just doesnt matter to me.I know you think it doesnt, Jill said, her voice low and angry, but thats because youve always had money.You grew up in that huge house.You have a father whos a gazillionaire.The whole time we were in college, I had to scrimp and work two jobs, while you had so much money to throw around you could barely carry it all!Kari looked stunned.Is that what youve thought all this time?I didnt care so much back then, because that was just where you came from, you know?But nowGod, Kari!Id kill to have a man like Greg, and you just walked away from him!I know it seems crazy, Kari said.I know that.But I was sitting there in that wedding dress, thinking about marrying him, and it just seemed soso wrong.But its not wrong.You were just nervous.A lot of brides get nervous!Kari closed her eyes, shaking her head slowly.Youre going to regret this, Jill said.If you dont make up with him and go back to Houston  I cant!Jills expression hardened.You can and you should.Tears filled Karis eyes.I cant believe youre talking to me like this.Havent we always stuck up for each other?Yes!But youve never done anything this stupid before!Kari looked positively stricken by Jills words.Do you really think its stupid for me to refuse to marry a man I dont love?For Gods sake, Kari!Learn to love him!Should I have to do that?Learn to love the man Im going to marry?Fine!Stay here.Ruin your whole life.I hope you never come back to Houston!With that, Jill spun around and left the inn, her footsteps echoing against the hardwood floor of the entryway.Marc heard the door open, then slam behind her.Kari visibly shuddered at the noise, hugging that hairy beast even closer to her chest and looking distressed.A tear coursed down her cheek, and she swept it away with the back of her hand.Dont cry, Marc said.That assholes not worth it.Its not Greg, Kari said, sniffing.Its Jill.I thought we were friends.Friends dont betray you like that.I know.I just thought she would understand.Why did you get engaged to that guy in the first place?She shrugged weakly.Everybody thought it was such a good idea.Particularly my father.Greg works at his company, and my father thinks hes wonderful.Mostly because theyre just alike.He seems hell bent on marrying you, but he doesnt seem to give a damn about how you feel about it.Kari was silent.Im just stabbing in the dark here, but does your father happen to have money?She paused.Yeah.A lot of it?More than you can possibly imagine.Marc was beginning to get the picture here, and it wasnt pretty.The asshole wanted to marry her for her money.Maybe he even saw himself at the helm of the old mans company someday, so he gave her a ring and conned her into an engagement.Her father seemed to think it was an excellent match, so the pressure was coming from two sides.And her friend Jill wasnt a friend at all if she thought marrying that guy was a good idea.It appeared everybody in Karis life pushed her around like a chess piece, right up to the day the pawn finally revolted.Thank you for sticking up for me, Kari said.That was nice.It wasnt nice.Nice had nothing to do with it.It was just a logical reaction to bad behavior.You have to call a halt to that kind of crap the instant it begins, or youll have more trouble than you know what to do with.Okay, then, she said.How about if I thank you for being logical?Marc didnt know what to say to that.He only knew it was time for Kari to do whatever she had to do to get out of Rainbow Valley and on the road back to Houston.Surely she had other friends who could help her.She could return to her old life minus a certain asshole, and Marc would finally be free of the drama he hadnt asked for in the first place.Rick called me this morning, he said.He said he pulled your car out of the ditch, but that you hadnt come by yet.I thought you were going over there first thing.I was, Kari said.But I slept late.And then when I came down here Her voice faded away.Look, I just came to tell you that you need to go see Rick.I asked him to haul your car in, so he needs to be paid for his time.Yes, she said on a sigh.I know.Just so you know, he thinks the car is a total loss.What?He said the frame is bent, which means it would cost more to fix the car than its worth.Oh, no.Kari sat down, her body going limp, then dropped her head to her hands.The rag mop scurried in a circle on the sofa, then jumped down to sniff a potted plant.Your insurance should reimburse you for the current value of the car, Marc said.Just call your insurance company, and itll all be taken care of.I cant do that.Why not?Because I dont own the car.Not exactly.What do you mean?Kari sighed.Its in my fathers name.Marc was confused.Why?Because he gave it to me as a gift a few years ago.And he never put it in your name?Thats right.So call your father and get him to talk to the insurance company.One way or another, youll get a check.Kari looked away.Im afraid theres a teensy little problem with that.Marc felt a glimmer of apprehension.The last time he heard the word problem, he got stuck unbuttoning a wedding dress.Unfortunately, she was looking up at him with those amazing green eyes, so he couldnt stop himself from asking, What problem?And then she told him, and Marc knew for sure that the chaos had only begun.Are you serious?he said.Your own father cleaned out your bank account?It looks that way.Hes a signer on the account.He can do that.Why is he a signer on your account?Its an old account from when I was in high school.And you never took him off it?It was never a problem before.And if he emptied my bank account, you can bet theres no way hell turn in a claim for the damage on the car and then hand the check over to me.Hes trying to force me to come back to Houston.He thinks if Im broke, thats what Ill do.My God, Marc said.Is there a part of your life your father doesnt control?Kari was silent.You said your only credit card is charged to the hilt.Is that right?Uh huh.Do you have any cash?Not much.Can you pay your hotel bill?Barely.You cant even feed yourself, can you?She sighed.Not for long.And now Ive chased away the only person who could get you back to Houston?he said, his voice escalating.Why didnt you stop me?You told me I shouldnt go with him!She was right.That was exactly what hed said.And it was because nothing made him angrier than to see a man treat a woman that way.Nothing.So what else could he have done?Kari stood there looking lost.The goofy little rag mop whimpered, then licked her chin.Do you really think I should have gone with him?she said quietly.Marc twisted his mouth with irritation.No, he muttered.No!Of course not.That guys an asshole.You shouldnt get within ten miles of him.But that means you have a big problem.I know.So whats your plan now?Well, I was thinking about that before Greg and Jill showed up.And?Nothing came to me.Then she was silent.At least her mouth was silent.Those gorgeous green eyes wouldnt shut up.And he couldnt turn her away any more than he could ignore a kitten in a snowstorm.Or, more accurately, a dirty bride in a rainstorm.Did Gus give you something to eat last night?he asked her.Yeah.You said you slept in.Did you miss breakfast?She sighed.Yeah.Come with me.Where are we going?she said.To Rosies for lunch.Ill buy.But by the time we finish eating, youre going to have a plan.And then youre going to put it into action.5    When Marc stepped into that parlor and told Greg to take a hike, hed seemed like a superhero to Kari.Showing up out of nowhere, standing there with those powerful arms folded over that big, broad chest, skewering Greg with that intense warning expressionyep.Superhero.Her superhero.And his self assurance had oozed over and filled her with the kind of confidence she couldnt have imagined feeling only seconds before.But now reality was setting in.Her superhero sat across from her in a booth at Rosies Caf, looking at her as if there were only certain things he used his superpowers for.Solving her problems in a way she liked didnt appear to be one of them.No way, she said as she swallowed yet one more french fry from heaven.Im not taking a bus back to Houston.What else are you going to do?You have no money, no job, no car, and no place to stay.Tell your father to give you your money back.Then get a real job instead of a throwaway one at his company so he doesnt control you anymore.Tell him youre making your own decisions from now on.And if the asshole comes within ten yards of you again, get a restraining order.There.You have a plan.You make it sound so easy.It is.If thats what you want, just say it.People will get on board.Sure.Theyll get on board with you.She shrugged weakly.Greg may have been right about me getting another job.But you have a degree, right?In English literature.Marc sighed.Yeah, theres not a big market for people who quote Shakespeare.What was your job at your fathers company?I was a marketing specialist.What exactly did you do?I assembled consumer opinion data by compiling, formatting, and summarizing graphs and presentations.So you made copies and stapled them together?Kari glared at him.You still have expenses back in Houston.What about your rent?Im living with my father right now.Marc screwed up his face.Seriously?My apartment lease was up.I moved into my fathers house for a few weeks until the wedding so I wouldnt have to sign a new lease.The house is so big he barely even knew I was there.Then after I got married, I was going to move into Gregs condo with him.So you have no apartment rent to pay right now.Thats right.Good.That means you can get something cheaper than you had before.Thatll go with your new job that Im guessing wont pay as much.Kari squeezed her eyes closed.This is a lot to think about.Yeah, but the faster you deal with it, the faster you can get on with your life.Theyre still going to try to get me to marry Greg.Wheres your backbone?Are you telling me you might actually marry the asshole after all?No!Are you sure about that?Yes.Of course Im sure!Because if youre that easily swayed, maybe you never should have left.Maybe you need to be married to a man wholl tell you what to do.I do not!Im not seeing much evidence of that.Hey!I left my own wedding, didnt I?Leaving was easy.Going back and taking care of yourself.Thats whats hard.Kari pursed her lips, hating the way that sounded, mostly because he was right.But she knew in her heart it was a mistake to return to Houston.No matter what Marc said about people getting on board with what she wanted if only she spoke up, she was still afraid shed fall back into her same patterns all over again where she let everybody elses opinion matter except hers.And do you know how you make sure you succeed?Marc went on.You burn your boats.What that means is  I know what it means.Alexander the Great.The Persian War.After they landed on the enemys shore, he burned their own boats so they couldnt fall back.They had to win the battle.I thought you were a lit major.Like nobody ever wrote a book about that?As I was saying, Marc said, if you burn your boats, you have no choice but to fight to the death.Oh, thats uplifting.Go home.Get face to face with your father.Quit your job if he hasnt fired you already.Burn your boats.That way you have no choice but to succeed on your own.Rosie swept back by their table again.She was a forty something woman with short brown hair and a pot of coffee in her hand.According to Marc, she wasnt a waitress.She owned the place.And she looked even more frazzled than she had the last time she stopped by their table.Can I get you guys anything else?Rosie said.Marc looked at Kari.She shook her head.The double cheeseburger shed just inhaled would probably hold her for a week.Were good, Marc said.Rosie turned to Boo.How about you, sweetie?When Boos ears perked up, she reached into the pocket of her apron and pulled out a dog biscuit.She laid it on the vinyl seat beside him, and he snapped it up.That was the third one shed given him from what she called Rosies Bottomless Basket of Doggy Biscuits.Youre getting slammed today, Marc said.Two tourist buses, Rosie said.Good for business, but Jolene quit to stay home with her baby.Hard to find good help?First I have to get a few applicants.All Ive had was one woman who wanted to bring her three children to work with her.Three dogs Id consider.Three kidsno.I hear you.Harvest is coming up soon.I never can get enough good help.If I hear of somebody who wants to pick grapes, Ill send them your way.As Rosie hurried away, Kari said, I couldnt take the bus even if I wanted to.After I pay Gus for the room, I probably wont even have enough money left for bus fare.Marc reached into his wallet, pulled out two twenties, and tossed them on the table.Thatll cover it.She flashed him a tiny smile.Gee, you must really want to get rid of me.Its just what needs to happen.Youll be glad you went back.He paused.Assuming you stand up for yourself.That hit Kari harder than she would have imagined.Marc clearly had no faith in her ability to stand up to anyone.In fact, shed been nothing but a gigantic pain in the ass to him since the moment she arrived, and she was pretty sure the only thing he wanted to see of her was her face in the window of that bus as she headed out of town.Just thinking about that made her miserable, and tears burned behind her eyes.No.Dont cry.Damn it, dont you cry!Im going to the ladies room, she said.Will you please watch Boo?Before he could say anything, she scooted out of the booth and hurried toward the ladies room, where she grabbed a paper towel and dabbed her eyes.All her life her father had treated her as if she was at best a helpless relative he had to support, and at worst a rock around his neck he wished he could rid himself of forever.But right now something made her feel even worse.She sensed that Marc felt exactly the same way about her that her father did.And for some reason she didnt fully understand, his respect was something she wanted to have.Kari heard the door open.She turned to see Rosie come into the ladies room.She saw Karis face and stopped short.Whats wrong?Nothing, Kari said.Yeah?In my experience, nobody cries for nothing.Kari almost said, My whole life sucks, but she swallowed the words before they could pop out.Shed just listened to Marc tell her it was time to take control of her own life.Whining didnt seem to fit into that new paradigm he was trying to acquaint her with.Im just having a little setback, Kari said.Sorry to hear that, sweetie.I take it youre a friend of Marcs?Yes, she said, because what was a friend, anyway?Somebody you went to when you were having a problem and needed help?Hed given her plenty of help last night, hadnt he?Dont worry, then, Rosie said.Hell help you out, whatever your problem is.Hes good like that.But he wants me to go back to Houston, and Im scared to!As Rosie headed to one of the stalls, Kari stood helplessly by the sink, knowing she should go back out to the restaurant.But the moment she did, Marc would pay the bill, shove the money for bus fare at her again, and tell her to hit the road.A minute later, the toilet flushed, and Rosie came out of the stall.She went to the sink to wash her hands.Kari washed her hands, too, so she wouldnt look as if she was loitering in the bathroom, even though she was.After they both dried their hands, Rosie headed for the door, and Kari wanted to cry all over again.She obviously couldnt stay in Rainbow Valley with no place to live, no job  Wait a minute.Job?Rosie?Rosie turned back.Yeah?Karis mind was spinning in a direction she wasnt sure was the right one, but she followed it, anyway.Didnt you say you have a job opening for a waitress?Yes.Thats part of my setback, she said.I need a job.Rosie walked a few steps back toward her.Yeah?Have you ever waited tables?Wellno.Kids?Just the four legged kind.Do you live in Rainbow Valley?Im relocating.Thats why I need a job.Would you consider hiring somebody with no experience?Most of the time I have to.Experienced waitresses are tough to find.But its hard work.Rosie looked her up and down.Sure you dont mind getting your hands dirty?She started to tell Rosie shed been way dirtier than this as recently as last night.Instead she said, Nope.I dont mind at all.The hours suck.Morning shift starts at six a. m. , and the evening shift goes until eight at night.Thats fine.Rosie looked unsure for a moment, then nodded.Okay.If youre a friend of Marcs, youre hired.But only on a trial basis.Thats the way I do it with everybody who goes to work for me.Most people dont realize just how hard waiting tables is, and most of them wash out.I wont.Dont hold your breath on that, sweetie.Lets see how it goes first.Once you and Marc are through with lunch, come see me and you can fill out the paperwork.Whats your name?Kari Worthington.Can you tell me what the job pays?Rosie quoted an impossibly small hourly rate, and Karis heart sank.But I have waitresses who make decent livings from tips alone, Rosie said.Its all about the hustle.With that, she left the bathroom, and Kari turned and looked at herself in the mirror.Okay.How hard could it be to wait tables?All you had to do was ask people what they wanted and then go get it for them.No, it didnt pay much, but right now she needed just enough to keep body and soul together until she could figure out what to do next.Marc sat at the table glaring at the rag mop, and the rag mop stared back.Then slowly the dog turned to look at Karis plate.Hed already grabbed one french fry when Marc wasnt looking.No way was that happening again.Dont you even think about it, Marc said.He inched closer.Hey.Closer still.Hey!The dog recoiled, retreating to the corner of the booth, where he turned to look back at Marc.Marc sighed.Of course Kari would have a dog as undisciplined as she was.Hey, Marc.I didnt know you were coming here for lunch.He turned around to see Nina approaching the table.Oh, crap.She slid into the booth across from Marc, only to stop short when she saw the rag mop.Oopswhats this?A dog.I wasnt asking for species identification.Whose dog is it?Marc didnt want to go there.He just didnt.Karis.Kari?Whos Kari?Im Kari.Marc winced at the sound of her voice.He gave her a quick glance, then turned back to Nina, who already had a calculating look on her face.Oh, this was going to be just great.Ah, Nina said.You wouldnt happen to be the woman who had an accident last night while you were wearing a bridal gown, would you?Kari smiled.Yeah.Thats me.Nina held out her hand.Hi.Im Nina.Marcs sister.Kari shook her hand.Kari Worthington.And whos this?Nina said, scratching Boo behind the ears.His names Boo.Well, hello there, Boo.Arent you a sweet puppy?Then Nina turned to Marc.Hey!What?Will you shove over and let Kari sit down?She was sitting over there.I can sit over here now, Kari said.Im finished with lunch.Marc let out a breath and moved over.Kari squeezed into the booth beside him.Even in a place filled with the scents of Texas home cooking, he could smell her.He didnt know if it was soap or shampoo or perfume, but it was as if somebody had stuck a bouquet of flowers in the seat next to him.He wasnt a flowery kind of guy, but that girlie smell got his attention every time, especially when it was radiating from a body like Karis.And shes nothing but drama, drama, drama, he reminded himself.You dont need that.Nina?Whos at the shop?Rupert got there early.He scheduled a special wine tasting with one of the tour groups coming through today.Did you see the buses?Yeah.I saw the buses.So, Nina said, you two are having lunch?She put a great big question mark on the end of her sentence, asking for more information, but no information was ever enough for his sister, so why even go there?We were just leaving, Marc said.Kari has a bus to catch.No bus, Kari said, smiling brightly.Change of plan.What change of plan?Marc asked.Im not going back to Houston.I have a job now.Marc stared at her dumbly.You what?I have a job.Im working here.Rosie hired me.When did that happen?In the ladies room.Let me get this straight.You went into the ladies room and came out with a job?Thats right.Have you ever waited tables before?No, but Ive eaten in a lot of restaurants.Rosie!Marc called out.Rosie turned at the sound of his voice, then came to their booth.Did you just give her a job?Marc asked.Yeah.Just like that?I need a waitress, and nobody else is beating down my door for the job.Did you check her references?References dont mean squat.People fake them.And even if theyre real, all an employer will give you are the dates of employment, and thats about it.Id rather just try somebody out on the job.Besides, I figured if she was with you, then shes okay.Great.Just for once, Marc wished he had a crappy reputation.Rosie turned to Nina.What can I get you?A BLT and sweet tea.Coming up.As Rosie walked away, Marc said, The job cant pay anything.Rosie said I could do pretty well with tips if I hustle, Kari said.Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a waitress?Particularly on the weekends when the tourists pack this place out?Hey!You gave me a big lecture about how I have no backbone and I cant take care of myself.So now that Im trying to take care of myself, youre giving me a hard time.So which is it?You gave her a lecture?Nina said.Advice, Marc snapped.Good advice.He turned back to Kari.Okay, so youve got a job.Now what?What do you mean?Where are you going to live?Ill rent an apartment.With what?You have no money.You have no money?Nina said.Long story, Kari said.Actually, it wasnt long at all.Her father was as big an asshole as her ex fianc, but the last thing Marc wanted to do was launch into that.Karis smile faded.Do you suppose there are any landlords in town who might be willing to postpone a deposit?What kind of businesspeople would they be if they did?Marc said.Then theres your first and last months rent.And everybody might love animals around here, but that doesnt stop them from collecting a pet deposit.Her smile disappeared altogether.Oh.Yeah.I guess youre right.Silence.Boo put his paws on the table and whimpered.Nina handed him over to Kari, who snuggled him against her chest and looked forlorn.Well, there is another option, Nina said.What?Marc said.Let her stay in the cottage at the vineyard.Marc came to attention, shaking his head.No.We dont rent the cottage.I didnt say you should rent it to her.Just let her stay there until she gets a deposit together for an apartment.She looked at Kari.Its not much.Just a tiny studio.Theres not even a bedroom.Just a pull out sofa.A microwave, a sink, and a small fridge.Bathroom with a shower.Sounds perfect, Kari said, then turned to look at Marc with a hopeful expression.He could have shot Nina.No, Marc said.Youre not staying there.Just until she gets on her feet, Nina said.I dont want anyone staying in the cottage right now.Oh, come on, Marc, Nina said.Youve let other people stay there over the years.I said no.Marc turned to Kari, nodding at his phone.I checked the schedule.The bus leaves in less than an hour.If youll let Gus know youre heading to the bus station, hell arrange for somebody to pick up your luggage.He grabbed up the two twenties and held them out to her.Kari glanced at Nina, who looked at Marc with an irritated frown, then turned away.Finally Kari took the money, her face falling into misery all over again.Thank you for everything youve done for me, she said to Marc.I dont blame you for not being able to do more.He should have been happy about that.So why did it make him feel like crap?Will you give me your address so I can return the money to you later?she asked.No need.No.I insist.Cordero Vineyards, Rainbow Valley, Texas.Itll get there.Kari nodded, looking even more forlorn than before, and her sad, defeated expression almost made him change his mind.But he couldnt give in.How was she supposed to stand up to her father if she didnt return to Houston?He had to hold his ground.No matter what Nina thought, it was best for all concerned.It was.Wasnt it?Well, then, Kari said.I guess Id better be going.She turned to Nina.It was nice to meet you.Nice to meet you, too, Nina said.You be careful now.Kari rose from the booth, put her purse over her shoulder, and she and her disorderly little dog went up to speak to Rosie.Then Marc watched out of the corner of his eye as she left the caf and disappeared down the street.Nina sat back and eyed Marc carefully.That wasnt like you.What do you mean?Youve let all kinds of people stay in that cottage over the years.Last fall after the wildfire, you let that man and his wife who lost their house stay there for a whole month.So why not let Kari stay?Is it really that big a deal?I dont even know her.You didnt know that man and his wife, either, yet you stepped right up to help them.They had a problem through no fault of their own.Kari left her fianc at the altar and ran.If shed confronted her problem instead of running, she wouldnt have ended up here.Not everybody is like you, Marc.Confrontation is hard for some people.Karis as sweet as she can be.Why wont you help her?You offered her the cottage without even asking me, Marc said.I had no idea it would be a problem.And then I was the one who had to say no.So say yes instead.Not this time.Marc  Will you knock it off?Nina clamped her mouth shut, but he could tell she still had plenty to say.Marc hated being the bad guy.He hated Nina insisting on something he did not want.And he hated feeling as if he was doing something wrong when, at this point in his life, nothing was more right.So why did he feel like the biggest jerk alive?I know what this is about, Nina said.Oh, you do?You think your life is going to be just rosy the day you get to hop on that motorcycle and head down the highway, and youre already resenting anybody you think might get in the way of that.Yes, by God, that was exactly right.It was nice that Nina was aware of how he felt.What wasnt nice was her tone that said he had no right to feel that way.But heres what you dont know, Nina said.When the time comes, you wont be able to do it.Thats where youre wrong.I am getting on that motorcycle.I am heading down the highway.And everybody else can take care of themselves for a switch.Without another word, Marc slid out of the booth, paid the check, then left the caf.He went to where his truck was parked in front of the wineshop and got in, telling himself hed done the right thing.Kari was doing what she needed to do.She was going back to face the music.Then maybe shed finally get her life in order.Yes, it was a very good thing.He started his truck and headed back down Rainbow Way toward the highway.Hed already spent too much time in town today when there were a hundred things he needed to do back at the vineyard.But as he drove, his mind began to wander.Who would pick Kari up at the bus station in Houston?Her friend, Jill, who thought she and the asshole were just perfect for each other?Her father who ran her life like a prison guard?The asshole himself who wanted her name on a marriage license so he could enjoy that nice big inheritance coming Karis way when her father finally kicked the bucket?Marc shook away those thoughts.It didnt matter.She needed to face up to the challenge.Sometimes people needed to have their backs shoved against the wall until they came out fighting.But would Kari come out fighting?Or would she give in and be stuck in a marriage with a man who saw her only as a means to a very lucrative end?She needs your help.No.Go home.Shes not your problem.But if she goes to Houston, she may be miserable for the rest of her life.Butt out.She has to learn to stand on her own two feet.He slowed his truck and pulled to the side of the road.He put it in park and gripped the steering wheel, listening to the voices parry inside his head until he was so confused he didnt know which way to turn, and confusion was a state he didnt like dealing with.Shake it off.You dont even know her.And youre certainly not responsible for her.Finally he put his truck in gear, hit the gas, and headed for home.6    An hour later, Marc was trimming the bushes that surrounded his back deck when his phone rang.He pulled it from his pocket and was happy to see Angelas name on the caller ID.Angela!Hey!How are things going?Great!Im having a blast.Oh, thank God.He loved hearing that happy lilt in her voice.No!School is serious business.Why am I paying all that tuition if youre not miserable?I want my moneys worth.Angela laughed.Too late.I love this place.How are things at home?Marc thought about Kari.No need to bring that up.Its only been a day, sojust about the same as when you left.Yeah, I guess nothing much has had time to happen, huh?If only she knew.How are you and your roommate getting along?Great.Weve got the room all set up.And we found out we have two of the big freshmen lecture classes together.Then Marc heard something in the background he didnt like.Is that a boys voice I hear?Yeah.Its a friend of Kims.He brought his roommate along.Were going to a movie this afternoon.Classes dont start for a few days, so we thought wed play around a little.Marc cringed.He remembered Kim and her tattoos and piercings and that hair that looked as if shed dyed it jet black and then stuck her finger in an electrical socket.What were the chances that she hung out with guys who were drug free virgins heading for the deans list?Sorry, Dad.I just called to say hi, but I gotta go now.Everybodys waiting for me.No.He wanted to keep talking.To what end, he didnt know.He hated this.As soon as the connection was gone, she could be anywhere.He wouldnt know if bad things happened, and the worry would begin all over again.Dad?Are you there?Okay, he said.Ill talk to you soon.Marc hit the button to disconnect the call and stuck his phone back into his pocket.So this was what it was going to be like for the next four years?Short little phone calls that made him worry until she called again for another two minute conversation that made him worry about something else?Then all at once he heard a loud noise coming from the front of the house.An engine?If so, it was a very large engine.Brandy leaped up and began to bark.Marc tossed the hedge clippers aside and came around the side of the house, and he couldnt believe what he saw.A bus had pulled into the circle drive in front of his house.The driver was closing the luggage compartment and climbing back onto the bus.A woman stood beside the bus next to a crapload of massive suitcases wearing a dress that looked like a tropical explosion.The bus began to pull away.Marc took off running, shouting at the driver, but the bus never slowed down.As it disappeared up his driveway, he stopped and stood there helplessly, then slowly turned to look at Kari.She looked small in the midst of those huge suitcases, holding that french fry stealing rag mop.The dog yapped once, then looked at him quizzically.Brandy tilted her head, clearly unsure what to think about a dog that looked like one of her fuzzy chew toys.He walked back and stopped in front of Kari.He rubbed his hand across his face, then let out a long, weary breath.Okay.How did you get that bus driver to bring you here?The route passes right by the vineyard.I just asked him if hed mind dropping me off.Are you nuts?Not completely.You told me to do it.What are you talking about?I didnt tell you  Yes, you did.You told me to burn my boats.What?Now that the bus is gone, I have to convince you to let me stay in your cottage, or I have no place to sleep tonight.Its not exactly a fight to the death, but if I have to drag all that luggage back to town, itll probably kill me.So I guess its pretty much the same thing.Marc couldnt believe it.How had she managed to use his own words so thoroughly and completely against him?I meant for you to do all that boat burning in Houston, he said.I picked a different battle.What if I put you in my truck and take you back to town?You could do that, Kari said.But Ill be knocking on your door again within the hour.I know that staying here is a lot to ask, but according to your sister, its not unprecedented.So whats it going to be?Are you going to let me stay in your cottage, or do I sleep on your front lawn?Good God.This woman was stuck to him like a barnacle on the side of a ship.I dont get you, Marc said.You want to stay in a town you know nothing about.Work in a place you know nothing about.At a job you have no experience for.She smiled.Its an adventure.I like adventures.Yeah, Marc said wearily.I gathered that.And you want to stay here when you dont know a damned thing about me.Actually, I know a lot about you.You met me last night.How could you possibly  Trust me.I know.The important stuff, anyway.Everybody I talk to says youre a good guy.Gus.Rosie.And you didnt let Greg push me around.A light breeze picked up a strand of her hair and swept it across her face.She brushed it away with her fingertips and peered up at him with those beautiful green eyes.As long as Im with you, I dont have to worry.Nothing bad will happen to me.Ah, crap.He did not need to hear that.
