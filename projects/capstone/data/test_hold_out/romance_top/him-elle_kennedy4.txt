Wess mouth falls open.What?My mouth slams shut.Jesus fuck.Why did I say that?I mean I swallow.It was rude.Wes stares at me.Droplets run down his chiseled face, catching in the beard growth shadowing his jaw.His lips are slightly parted.I cant stop looking at them.What is happening right now?he asks slowly.Misery lodges in my throat.I dont know.I honestly dont know whats happening.The rain falls harder.A flash of lightning slices through the black sky.I should be cold, but Im not.My body feels like a furnace.Three beers shouldnt be having this effect on me.Maybe its him?Maybe hes making me hot?Wess tongue darts out to lick at the raindrops on his bottom lip, and I catch a glimpse of his tongue ring.It wasnt there when we were eighteen.It wasnt there when his tongue had circled the head of my cock the night he gave me the best BJ of my life.And there it is.Ryan Wesley had given me the best BJ of my life.Canning He trails off, watching me again.He looks uneasy, buttheres something else in his gaze.A flicker of confusion.A hint of interest.I take a step closer, but Im not sure why.My heart is pounding harder than the rain.My eyes are glued to his mouth.Jamie.A note of warning this time.I suck a gulpful of oxygen into my lungs.Then I ignore the warning.His eyes widen as I shove my fingers through his hair and tug his head closer.What  He doesnt get to finish that sentence, because Im smashing my mouth against his.14      Wes      Jamie is kissing me.Jamie is kissing me.Jamie is kissing me.Nope, no matter which way I run it through my head, it still doesnt make sense to me.The pressure of his mouth?Makes no sense.The shocking sweep of his tongue over my bottom lip?No sense.But holy fucking shit, I want it.Rain pours off the awning and slides over our heads as my best friends lips latch onto mine.I taste the rain, beer, something addictively masculine.His mouth brushes mine, over and over again, and when I part my lips to draw a shaky breath, he takes full advantage and slides his tongue inside.Its like a cattle prod to the spine.Desire surges through me and spirals down to my balls, drawing them up tight.When his tongue touches mine I damn near keel over.I have to grab the front of his shirt and bunch it between my fingers to keep from being swept away by the storm.Not the storm thats lighting up the sky, but the one thats roaring inside me.I know the moment he feels my tongue ring, because his tongue curls around the metal stud and he moans against my lips.Deep and husky.Its that lust drenched sound that snaps me back to reality.This might feel right, but its wrong.Hes drunk again.Not thinking clearly.For some reason he decided shoving his tongue down my throat was a good idea, but it fuckin aint.At the end of the day, Im still gayand hes still straight.Even worse, Im still in love with him.With a tortured groan, I wrench my mouth away.I cant fucking do this again.I cant let myself want him or get my hopes up about the two of us.Hes my friend.Hell always be my friend and nothing more.His eyes, hazy with passion, absolutely wreck me.He blinks as if disoriented, as if he cant understand why I broke the kiss.Your tongue ring His voice is hoarse with excitement.I want to feel it on my cock.Oh sweet Jesus.Okay, hes drunker than I thought.I hadnt seen him pound back more than a couple beers, but he must have snuck a few more in when I wasnt looking.Yeah I manage a hasty laugh.Thats not gonna happen, man.Jamie narrows his eyes.The rain slows a bit, making it easier to speak without having to raise my voice.Were not going down this road again, Canning.I swallow hard.The last time we did, it ruined our fucking friendship.He slants his head, those big brown eyes gleaming with challenge.Youre saying you dont want me?Aw hell.No, Im saying this is a bad idea.Jamie steps closer, backing me into the wall until my back bumps the wet bricks.Now hes got me pinned in place.Theres a hard wall behind me and an equally hard one in front of me.Emphasis on hard, because holy hell, hes rocking one hell of a boner.It presses against my thigh as he eases even closer, until his lips are inches from mine.Youre the king of bad ideas, he reminds me.At least this one ends with both of us feeling good.Hes going to kill me.The role reversal melts my brain, because Im the one whos usually in charge, who calls the shots, sets the limits.Jamie shifts his hips, a breath panting out as his erection brushes my leg.If he were sober, hed probably be horrified.When he sobers up, he will be horrified.Hell apologize for coming on to me, and well end up having that awkward conversation we shouldve had after I blew him four years ago.Hell tell me hes straight, he was just fucking around, hes not into me.And Ill be crushed.I know all this, but it doesnt stop me from stealing one more taste.I mentioned Im a masochist, right?Its the only explanation for why I curl my hand around the back of his neck and tug him toward me again.Our mouths meet in another kiss.Soft this time.Agonizingly slow.Its not enough.Ill stop it soon, any second now, but not yet.Not until he gives me more.Groaning, I push my chest against him and spin us around so hes the one against the wall, and Im the one grinding up on him.He makes a surprised noise, but it turns into a husky rumble when I deepen the kiss and drive my tongue into his mouth.Im greedy now.Desperate.I fuck his mouth with my tongue the way I want to fuck him with my cock.Deep, hungry strokes that leave us both breathless, and now hes the one clutching my shirt.To my right, the door of the bar bangs open.A female shriek rings out.Shes probably screaming about the weather, not the two guys against the wall trying to eat each others faces.Either way, her scream brings me back to my senses.Stumbling backward, Im panting like Ive just run three marathons.Im under the downpour now, but Jamies not.So I can see his expression perfectlythe wide eyed panic on his face.The disbelief.Fuck.My straight as a blue line friend is about to freak out.An hour from now, hell probably have one hell of an identity crisis, and for what?The best kiss of my life wasnt worth screwing up his life.Ive lived confusion.It aint pretty.Now I have to look away.If I dont, hell see my eyes and know Im dying inside.I want him more than anything in the goddamn world.It takes all my willpower, but I turn and walk off in the rain toward my car.The rain is coming down in sheets, so I start to run for it.I dont even know hes followed me until he slides into the passenger seat opposite me and slams the door.In less than thirty seconds Ive got the engine cranked.Were cruising back up 73 toward Lake Placid before a whole minute has passed.Theres a terrible silence in the car.If it werent raining Id probably double the speed limit trying to get Jamie back to town.He still hasnt said a word.Im sorry, I croak.Didnt mean to let that happen.He makes an irritated noise.Im dying to know what it means, but too chicken shit to ask.We are never speaking of this night again.Never.Even if were wasted the night before Jamies wedding.Even if were trapped in a mineshaft with thirty minutes of oxygen.Not even then.Earlier, I told him hed acted like a douchecanoe.But thats crap.Im the one whos in love with my best friend and pretending Im not.The rain lets up.A few minutes later (even though it feels like hours) I pull up in front of the dormitory building and step on the brakes.Jamie doesnt move.Im going to find a parking spot, and then take a walk, I tell him.There is no way I can go back to our room right now.We need a time out.I hope he understands.Later, when hes asleep, it might be possible to breathe the same air as Jamie Canning again.He doesnt move.Please, I beg him inwardly.Please go up to bed.Its hard enough to look at his face each day and not feel heartbreak.I cant be close to him right now.Im afraid Ill give in and kiss him again.The way his hard body had aligned so perfectly with mine is burned in my consciousness.Ill be trying not to remember that for weeks.I wait, and I ache.Finally the door clicks open.I hear him exit the car.When the door slams shut, I feel it like a sledgehammer to the heart.Dont look, I coach myself.But my self control isnt infinite.His fair hair glints under the streetlight as his long legs eat up the walkway in just a few paces.Seeing him walk away from me splinters something inside me.15      Jamie      I pound up the steps of the building, my heart thumping, my skin wet from the rain and sweat and nerves.Jamie.Shit, Id almost made it inside.But Pat is sitting in stealthy darkness in one of the rocking chairs on the front porch.Hes probably on stakeout, watching for teenagers sneaking out.Instead hes caught me sneaking in.And at the sound of his voice I feel at least as much terror as an escaping kid.Stumbling, I stop before reaching the door.Hey, I say, trying to sound normal.At least its dark.I dont trust my face right now.Got a minute?Do I?What I need is to be alone for several hours to bang my head against a wall.To try to figure out what on Gods green earth just happened.But Pat is like a second father to me, and being rude to him isnt something I can do.I dont answer, but I do take the rocking chair right next to his.My hands are shaking so I curve them around the chairs arms.A couple of very slow breaths help me calm down.Across the road, the lake is a dark void.Lights from the Lake Placid restaurants twinkle in the misty night air.Everything looks so calm and ordinary.The world would make more sense to me if the buildings were falling into the lake, or the fudge shops were on fire.But the only thing quaking is me.You okay, son?Yeah, I grind out, my voice like a chainsaw.Got caught in the rain.I can see that.Hes quiet for a moment.I just wanted to ask you how Wesley is holding up.Did the first week treat him okay, you think?Just the sound of his name makes my gut clench.Well, Pat, I just threw myself at him.We made out like porn stars up against the side of a bar.Then he gave me the brush off.And I dont have any idea what any of it means.Hes, uh, okay, I stammer.I dont really even remember the question hed asked.If hes struggling out there, I hope youll tell me.I wont fire himIll just get him some backup.I pull myself together and try to focus on the conversation.Coaching takes practice.Pat smiles.Thats very diplomatic of you.Coaching takes practice, yes, but not everyone is a natural at it the way you are.Thank you.The compliment is unexpected.And I think the kids will get a lot out of their time with WesI wouldnt have hired him if I wasnt sure of that.Pats chair squeaks as he rocks it gently.It surprised me, though, getting that call from him.It was a few hours after the Frozen Four victory.Id watched the gameit makes my year anytime I get to watch you boys on my television.But its funnywhen I saw who was calling, I had this moment where I thought he was going to say, I owe it all to you.He chuckles to himself.Thats not Wess style, so I dont know why I expected to hear that.But yeah, when he said, Im calling to take that job you offer me every year, I really was surprised.So am I.  In fact, many things about this information surprise me.Youve been recruiting him all these years?Sure.All my boys who become successful college players get a call from me.Wes never said yes, though.Then I get this call He pauses.Took a lot of guts, really.He says, I want to coach for you this summer.But you need to know Im gay.Nobody knows, but if it bothers yourunning a camp and allI understand.A drop of sweat runs down my back.What did you tell him?Even though I know Pat hired him, my breath still catches for the Wes on the other end of that phone, waiting for someone to pass judgment on him.Maybe it takes more balls to be Wes than Id realized.I said that was his business, and I didnt give a shit as long as he showed up every morning ready to coach.Later I asked him if he wanted to room with you again after all these years.He said, Sure, but I gotta come out to Jamie, too.If he has an issue, you might have to trade things around.An issue.I have one all right.My issue is the giant boner he gave me tonight.God, its a struggle not to bury my head in my hands and scream from confusion.Weirdest night of my life.Right here.Winner!And Coach Pat is still waiting for me to say something.Um, I just told him Im from Northern California.Pat laughs.I see.Didnt think youd have a problem.You two were inseparable all those years.Inseparable.A while ago my tongue was inseparable from his.And it was all my doing.I mauled my best friend.His taste is still on my lips.I need to eject from this conversation before I lose my mind.No problem at all, I say gruffly.I think I gotta hit the hay, though.Good night, coach.Good night.I climb the stairs and walk down the hall toward our room.None of the doors have light leaking from underneath, but I can hear the sound of voices and male laughter as I pass by.Wes and I had been the same at their agetalking til all hours.Now?Im not sure were talking at all.I make a stop in the bathroom to brush my teeth.When I catch my face in the mirror, it looks the same as it always does.Same square jaw.Same brown eyes.My skin is a little pale under the fluorescent bathroom lights.Theres nothing to see here, but like an idiot I stare a little while, looking for who knows what.A change.A sign.What does a guy whos not as straight as he thought look like, anyway?Like you, apparently.My lips move with these words, and Im no closer to understanding what happened.But now Im talking to myself.Awesome.I cant avoid it any longer, so I head into our room.Flipping the lights on only makes me squint, so I shut em off again.I strip down to my briefs and climb into bed.Im sober now, which is a bummer.Thats not going to help me sleep.But at least Im not shaking like a leaf anymore.Wes is not here, but I feel his presence.And Im just lying awake, waiting to hear his rough, cocky voice in the hallway.Its not an exaggeration to say Ive always felt a little more alive when hes around.Life is just a little brighter, a little louder wherever Wes is.But now its tempting to reexamine my impressions of him.Im mostly sure Ive always loved him as a friend and that tonights impulse was just a new craving born of beer, ordinary jealousy, horniness and some kind of friendly emotional overload.The perfect storm.My desire is a strange creature of the night, brought to life by a strike of lightning in exactly the right place.Right?Sigh.Im not a navel gazer.I dont sit around inventing complex theories to explain my behavior.But tonight its impossible not to lie here and wonder All those times I watched him fly down the rink with the puck under his commandwas that simple admiration?All those times I watched his flashy skating with a warm feeling in my chest.Or when hed smile at me from across the table.Was I hiding something from myself?Or was there nothing to suppress?Fuck, does it even matter?Desire is chemistry.And in a biochem class I took once, they taught us that all chemistry is just electricity.Were all just bags of charged atoms walking around bumping into each other.My electrons went seriously haywire for his tonight, though.Particles collided.Pushing my hips into the mattress, I wish I could feel it againthe press of his body.The scrape of rough hands on my forearms.I dont know why I want it.I dont know if the craving will disappear with tonights rain shower.But right this moment its here.And its real.The night now feels endless.And tomorrow will be an awkward eternity.Yay.I cant even begin to imagine what Wes is thinking right now.He wanted meI felt it.But he stopped because it would ruin our friendship.This man who fucks strangers off an app.Im still lying there face down in my pillow when his key finally turns in our lock.I freeze, of course.He tiptoes in.I hear the thud of his hiking boots hitting the floor, and the soft swish of clothing coming off.My dick hardens against the mattress.Im actually hard, and all hes done is walk in and undress.Interesting.His sheets rustle as he gets into bed.And then theres silence.A minute passes, then two.Im not sleeping, and he can probably tell.Which means were like two teenage girls after a catfight at a sleepoverignoring each other.I roll over to face him.If youre trying to avoid me, you might have to do another seventeen laps around town.Im still awake.Wes sighs.How are you feeling?Horny.He snorts.Thats the beer talking.Did you know you go gay when youre drunk?When I hear the word gay, I almost argue.But thats not really the point.Im not drunk, Wes.What I am is very, very curious.Wes thinks he did me a favor tonight by heading us off at the pass, but now I have this giant question inside me, and I dont think it will fade in the morning.But it will make things awkward.Ill be watching him in the mirror while we both shave, wondering what it would have been like.Wondering whether its something I could really get into, or just a weird moment of happenstance.I dont want to fuck with your head, he whispers.I wish I hadnt ever done that.But its not my head that needs fucking.Come over here, I say.Please.No fucking way, he replies.I can make you.He laughs.Did you smoke some pot while I was out, Canning?I laugh, too, and its such a relief.Because it means I havent wrecked everything.But then I lift my hips, peel off my briefs, and throw them at his head.He bats them away, smiling in the dark.Kicking the sheet off, I put my hand on my dick.And he stops laughing.16      Wes      Fuck me.Im a strong guy.Im a tough guy.But I was not built to withstand the sight of Jamie Canning stroking himself.The shred of moonlight shining through the gap in the curtains shows him reclining on his back, his far knee cocked wide.His body is perfectstrong and lean on the bed.His palm is cupped over his dick, the fingertips just brushing the cockhead.He takes a deep breath and then pushes it out slowly, his back arching a little ways, his hips rolling a few degrees.And I am dying a quiet death.My mouth actually waters, and I have to swallow hard.Hes right there.In two paces I could have him in my mouth.Its like Jamie Canning looked into my filthy mind and extracted my fantasies.Well, the opening reel, anyway.He doesnt turn his head to look at me, because he doesnt have to.We both know where my attention lies.He squeezes his shaft once.Twice.Then he opens his hand, letting the fingers drift down.He cups his balls, his thumb skimming the delicate skin.I hear a hot gasp, and realize its come from me.Then?The fucker smiles.That wakes me up, at least a little.What the fuck are you doing?I really need to jerk.You mind?Holy...!I rue the fucking day that I said those same words to him.I was eighteen, and I thought I was so smooth.But I was only setting in motion some serious pain for everyone.And its still happening.Theres blood pounding in my ears now.And other places.My hand creeps down into my boxers without my approval.Jamie is pumping himself now.Slowly, up and down.He pauses to rub his thumb over the head, and my throat constricts.Wes, he says, his voice like gravel.I need your help.Its a miracle Im able to answer in an almost normal voice.Looks like youre doing fine on your own.Thats when he finally turns his head to look at me.As he rubs himself, he swallows, and I see his Adams apple bob roughly.I need to know.Know what?I almost ask.But hes studying me now.His eyes are trailing across my chest and down my arm.Hes watching the hand in my shorts.And I get it.He wants to know why hes feeling this way, if its attraction or beer or temporary insanity.Earlier tonight I was telling him the truth when I said I didnt want to help him make this discovery.Im not sure Id survive it.This is, of course, all my fault.We lock eyes.His are heavy lidded.Ive always wanted another chance to see his lust filled face.Now his lips part on the upstroke, and its almost enough to get me across the room.But still I hesitate, and not because Im afraid hell regret this tomorrow.Because I know I will.Please, he says.That one word is enough to get me off my bed.Im standing in the center of our room now, hands on the waistband of my boxers.I yank and let them drop to the floor.And now hes staring at my cock, stroking his.What do you want?I ask.And I need him to be specific.This is a very dangerous game were playing.It will probably end in disaster.But if theres any way I can prevent that, I will.He moves further onto the bed, making room for me.Then he beckons.And there isnt enough money, fame or fortune in the world to keep me from obeying.Im on that bed a second later.His arms reach for me, pull me in.Were side by side, chest to chest.And Jamie Canning is kissing me again.He doesnt taste like beer anymore, but toothpaste.Theres no way either of us can blame this on alcohol tomorrow.His tongue is in my mouth and I take greedy pulls on it, loving every second of it.Our lower bodies grind together, and he lets out a soft moan, rocking harder into me.His cock slides over my belly, lines up with my own aching shaft.That bit of friction brings stars to my eyes.Fuck, I choke out.His eyes slit open, searching my face as his tongue comes out to lick his bottom lip.If you stop right now, Im going to kick your ass.Stop?Is that a word?What does it mean?Probably the opposite of what Im doing when I slide my hand between our bodies and grasp both our cocks in my hand.Jamies spine arches on another husky moan.Oh shit.Thats good.I jack us slowly, squeezing on each upstroke.His mouth finds mine again.His stubble scrapes my cheek as he angles his head to deepen the kiss.That magic tongue slides between my lips again, hungry and eager.I cant believe were doing this.I cant believe hes letting me do this.Were both leaking, making it so fucking easy for my fist to slide over our slick cocks.My balls are heavy, tingling with the need for release.A few more strokes and Ill probably blow, but Jamie doesnt let it happen.He wrenches out of my grip and plants both palms on my chest to shove me onto my back.My dick sails up and slaps my navel, and he groans at the sight before wrapping his fingers around my shaft.Can I His voice comes out in a rush.Can I suck you off?Holy mother of God.Im caught in some kind of fever dream.I have to be, because theres no other explanation for why my best friend is offering to put his mouth on my dick.I figured this exploratory I need to know if I like dudes session would involve me doing all the work, ravaging him the way Ive always fantasized about doing.But one thing about Jamie Canning?Hes full of surprises.Every time he used to accept one of my crazy challenges, my eyebrows would soar, my mind unable to comprehend how this laidback Cali boy who always followed the rules could be so willing to follow me down whatever rabbit hole I was leading him into.Im not leading him into anything tonight, though.This is all Jamie.Its Jamies fingers skimming along my hard length.Jamies breath hot on the tip of my dick as he slides down and brings his mouth within inches of me.Have you ever I swallow past the gravel in my throat.Done this before?No.His lips are hesitant as they graze my cockhead.I might suck.A laugh chokes out.Sucking is kind of the point.He lifts his head, brown eyes twinkling.I might be bad at it, he corrects.You wont be.Because theres no way he can be.Im too close to coming already, just from being in the same bed as him.He doesnt need skillhe just needs to be here.Him.Here.With me.I almost lose my mind when his tongue touches me.Every inch of me is hot, tight, prickling with need.He licks a slow circle around my tip, then kisses his way down my shaft.Hes kissing my dick, light, open mouthed caresses that blow my fucking mind.Holy shit.Jamie Canning is a cocktease.Who woulda thought?You trying to drive me crazy?I growl after he kisses another path up my cock.His chuckle vibrates through me.Is it working?Yes.I slide both hands through his hair, cupping his head.What about you?Enjoying your first taste of dude?He laughs harder now, broad shoulders quaking as he crouches between my thighs.Its His tongue finds me again, tickling the underside of my shaft.Different.He wraps his hand around my base and closes his mouth around my cockhead, giving a slow, decadent suck.Its  He sucks again, taking me deeper this time, and my cock pulses uncontrollably.He must feel it on his tongue because he groans, loudly, desperately.He lifts his head, his expression foggy with lust, cloudy with confusion.Joy surges through me.And apprehension, because I dont know what to do with his bewilderment.Do I assure him its no big deal?That its perfectly cool for a straight guy to love blowing another man?But he doesnt give me the chance to say anything.He just dips his head and his hot, wet mouth surrounds me again.My hips shift on the mattress, pure lust sizzling in my cock and balls as my best friend works me over.I keep one hand tangled in his hair.The other claws at the sheet, bunching it tight between my fingers.My heart is pounding.Its all I can hear, a frantic thump thump rattling my ribcage.That and the sounds Jamie is making.Husky groans, wet pops, a deep growl as he takes me almost all the way to the back of his throat.Jesus Christ.This man is wrecking me.Im wrecked.Im  Going to come, I ground out.The climax seizes my balls and shoots up my shaft, hot jets spurting out of my cock just as Jamies mouth releases me.He strokes me through the release, his breathing heavy and eyes gleaming as he watches my come land on my abs, my chest.I cant breathe.Im a gasping, shuddering mess, and he just keeps watching.And then the fucker does it againhe smiles.He fucking smiles as he lowers his head and licks one pearly drop off my stomach.That was so hot, he tells me.Hot?Try scorching.Blistering.A goddamn inferno.Im unable to do anything but lie there like a sack of potatoes.Struggling to breathe.Blinking like an owl as I watch the most beautiful man grab my discarded shirt from the floor and clean me up.Once hes done, he tosses the shirt away and bends down to kiss my collarbone.Then my shoulder.My other shoulder.He keeps kissing my feverish flesh, licking, nibbling, and I just let him explore, offering myself up as his sexual guinea pig.Hes tasting every inch of me, his mouth moving tentatively over the ripples of my abs, my hips, my pecs.I moan when he licks one of my nipples, and he peeks up at me, his lips curving.You like that.I manage a nod.He does it again, this time closing his lips around the tiny nub and sucking on it.I can feel his erection against my thigh, leaving streaks of moisture against my skin.Drawing a breath, I reach down and grasp him, and now Im smiling, because his tongue freezes on my nipple as his entire body tenses.He thrusts into my hand, and its all the invitation I need.On your back, I mutter.Jamie rolls over so fast it makes me laugh.He props his arms behind his head, one brow cocked as he nudges his hips up, all but taunting me with his perfect dick.Lets see if youve still got it, he teases.My laughter is muffled against his stomach.You know, youre a cocky bastard when youre gay.Guess I am.I slowly crawl up his body, propping my elbows on either side of his head.Our gazes lock.He parts his lips, peering up at me with hazy eyes.Swallowing, I lower my mouth to his in a soft kiss.Fuck, I taste myself on his tongue, and its enough to send my mind spinning.This guygoddamn it, this guy.Ive never wanted anyone the way I want Canning.The way I crave Canning.Four years worth of meaningless sexual encounters flash through my head as I break the kiss and slide down his body again.All those guys I hooked up with in the pasttheyre a blur.Theyre faceless.Sometimes they were faceless even when I was with them.I got off, they got off, but I wasnt fully present.I always held something back from them.Not with Jamie.I cant hold back with him, and never could.Trust me, Ive still got it, I whisper as my mouth descends toward his cock.And Im going to prove it to him.Show him how much I fucking love him, because I sure as shit cant tell him.I take a breath.His erection is millimeters away and its mine.Tonight, hes mine.I grip his shaft and give it a light squeeze.He shudders in response, watching me.Waiting.Licking my lips, I bend down and swipe my tongue over the little slit at his tip.He teased me before, and now its time for some payback.Im going to worship every inch of Jamie Cannings cock.Im going to torment him with my tongue until he cant remember a time when my mouth wasnt on his dick bringing him pleasure.Im going to  Jamie comes the second I wrap my lips around him.Yup, he fucking comes, and I dont know whether to laugh or groan as he starts to shake with release.In the end I do neitherI suck him all the way down to the base, drawing a strangled cry from his lips as I swallow the salty drops that shoot down my throat.When he finally goes still, I raise my head with a sigh.Really, dude?That was like two seconds.You have the stamina of a pre teen.His shoulders tremble as he rolls over on his side in hysterics.I guess youve still got it, he chokes out between laughs.Climbing up the mattress, I ease in behind him, yanking his big body toward me.He stiffens for a second, then relaxes, his taut ass nestling against my groin, his back flush to my chest.I wrap an arm around his waist.If Im honest, I wanted this as much as the blowjobthe right to just touch him.To lean on him, skin to skin.But hes silent.Too silent, probably.Jamie, I murmur in his ear, before planting a kiss on his shoulder.Are you going to freak out now?The pause before he speaks cuts me in half.Do you want me to?Theres humor in his voice.No.Its my turn to pause.Do you want me to go back to my bed?He snuggles even closer, plastering himself to my body like a warm blanket.No.He sighs in contentment.Night, Wes.A lump rises in my throat.Night, Canning.17      Jamie      Wes isnt beside me when I open my eyes the next morning.I roll over and study the room.His bed is empty.It doesnt look like its been slept in, and I dont remember him climbing out of mine during the night.What I do remember is waking up at six in the morning to find Wess arm wrapped tightly around me.Then Id fallen back asleep, so he mustve left some point after that.Probably makes me a jerk, but Im relieved.Im not sure what I would have said if I woke up to find us snuggling.According to the alarm clock on the end table, its almost eleven thirty.Dining hall stops serving breakfast at eleven.Id slept right through it, but thats okay.Its our day off, so Im not needed at the rink.On the other hand, its our day off.That means hours and hours of free time.Time Ill probably be spending with Wes.Who I hooked up with last night.I dont feel any different, though.I fooled around with a guy yesterdayshouldnt I feel different?Feel gay, you mean?A laugh bubbles in my throat.Does one feel gay?And damn it, Im bewildered to discover Im rocking a boner, and its more than just a case of morning wood.Its Wes wood, a result of thinking about us messing around.Ithink I might want to do it again.And how screwed up is that?Id been fully prepared to view last night as a chemistry experiment.A test.I hadnt expected to ace the damn thing.The door suddenly swings open and Wes trudges inside, red faced and breathing hard.Hes in running gear, the front of his sleeveless shirt drenched in sweat.He peels it off his muscular chest and throws it aside.Its fucking hot out there, he mumbles without glancing my way.Oh shit.Hes going to make it awkward.He cant even look me in the eye.Why didnt you wake me?I ask.I wouldve come running with you.He shrugs.Figured Id let you sleep in.He kicks off his shoes and socks, then strips out of his shorts.Now hes naked.And Im even harder.Hes still averting his gaze, so he has no idea Im admiring his lean, sculpted muscles and the black ink winding around his heavy biceps.I realize this is the first time Ive seen him naked in the light of day, and his skin gleams in the sunlight peeking through the curtains.Hes all muscle.All man.And all those questions Id asked myself last nightAm I really attracted to him?Would I like it if we hooked up?Am I totally crazy?I know the answers to them now.Yes, yes, and maybe.But I didnt expect to wake up with more questions.I slide out of bed and notice hes making an even greater effort not to look at me now.Becauseyep, Im naked, too.Wed fallen asleep naked.In each others arms.His back is to me as he stalks over to the dresser.Wes, I say quietly.He doesnt react.He grabs a pair of blue gym shorts from the top drawer and tugs them up to his hips.Wes.His shoulders tense.Very slowly, he turns around, and his gray eyes focus on my face.Theres an unspoken question flickering therewhat now?Fuck if I know.What I do know?Im not equipped to have this conversation right now.Not until Ive given it some thought and figured out what I want from this.From him.So I put on a careless tone and ask, What are we doing today?Hes silent for a beat.I can tell he expected me to go all chick on him and demand we talk about last night.I can also tell hes relieved I decided to choose the dude route and ignore it.His lips quirk slightly.Well, we need to get some food in you and then hike over to the soccer field.The kids came back from the fishing hole already because nothing was biting except the mosquitoes.So Pats organizing a game.And just like that, were cool again.Sure, were pretending we didnt blow the shit out of each other last night, but for now, Im happy to pretend.Im not ready to deal with this yet.I wrinkle my forehead.For the kids?Nope, the coaches.But a bunch of the boys are already there taking bets on which team will win.There are teams already?How long had I been asleep?Wes grins again.Pats calling it boys versus men.Him and the older coaches against us younguns.Sweet.Im not a soccer enthusiast, but any sort of competition gets my adrenaline going.PSlosers have to perform a song for the campers in the dining hall tonight, Wes says.I narrow my eyes.Which song?Winners choice.He snickers.Just out of curiositywho came up with these stakes?My best friend blinks with the utmost innocence.Thats what I thought.You know if we lose, Pats gonna make us sing Mariah Carey or some shit, I grumble as I look for my shorts.Which is why were not going to lose, he says cheerfully.We stop at the bakery in town so I can grab a coffee and something to eat, and I scarf down two banana muffins as we head to the soccer field.Its another gorgeous day and the tourists are out in droves, bustling down the sidewalk and filling the outdoor patios we pass on our way.Two chicks stop in their tracks as Wes and I walk by.Theyre in their early twenties, both blond, both incredibly attractive.One girl is wearing a top thats cut so low her tits are practically hanging out of it, and a spark of heat ignites my groin.Shi it.That rack is spectacular.Wes winks at them and keeps walking.I match his strides, trying not to glance over my shoulder to see if the girls are watching us.Okay, just one peek.I flick my chin back for a quick look, which causes one of the girls to nudge her friend.Whoops.See something you like?Wes asks.I feel a slap of discomfort that wouldnt have been there twenty four hours ago.Just thinking things over, I mumble.Ill bet.His voice is low.We dont speak of it anymore, because I dont need to involve Wes in my confusion.But Im pretty sure that my dick is an equal opportunity player.Because I love women.I love how soft they are and the way they smell and how they feel in my arms.I love fucking them and going down on them, and Im never faking it.Last night, I wasnt faking it, either.And now I have no idea what it all means.Wes nudges me, then points at a street sign were passing.Cummings Road.Like that joke has never been made before.Now whos the pre teen?He stiffens for a beat, as if he didnt expect me to make a reference to last night.Then he snorts.Lets play some soccer, Canning.Indeed.First, Pat gathers everyone around.You cant ask a bunch of highly competitive athletes to play a friendly game of soccer without going over a few rules first.There will be two twenty minute periods.And will the offsides rule count?Yes it will.Is slide tackling legal?No.Because I will fucking kill anyone who injures himself, Pat adds.Good to know.Were playing five on five, and Im in the goal, of course.I can see Killfeather over on the side, watching me with a grin on his face.Hes not a bad kid when he forgets to be stressed out.Im not stressed, either.Im bored to tears, because Wes and the other guys are giving em hell at the other end of the field.Were up 1 0 by the time I have to make my first save.A soccer net is a lot bigger than a hockey goal, so saving the net seems more haphazard.But I stop Pats shot in my hands and my team cheers.I set the ball down on the line, back up and kick it downfield.Before it reaches Wes, he gives me a little smile, then traps the ball with his chest.It drops to the ground between his muscular legs and then hes off running, controlling the ball, masculine beauty in motion.Suddenly Im thinking about sex again.In the middle of a game.Thats never happened before.The next time the ball threatens our goal, things dont go so well.Our defense falls apart when Pat is able to deke my teammate Georgie, leaving the most senior coach unguarded.The old man promptly fires a flying saucer right at me.I leap, but it sails past my thumb and into the corner of the net.Wes makes an ornery noise, and I can see hes about to lay into Georgie for leaving us wide open.Meanwhile, Killfeather and the rest are watching.I walk over to Wes and put a hand on his shoulder.Hey, I say, holding my hand up for a high five.Well get the next one.Wes is a quick study, so its no surprise to me that he catches on.He smacks my hand.Yeah, man.Then?He reaches around behind me and gives my ass a quick squeeze.Holy!I cant help that my eyes dart around, checking everyones face for a reaction.But there isnt one, because nobody saw.And even if they had, its such a Wes move that nobody would think twice about it.But I do.Because even if Im not freaking out about what we did last night, I dont want anyone else to know.If Wes was a girl, I wouldnt care, though.And why is that, exactly?my conscience wonders.Its a good question, and not one that Im prepared to answer.And anyway, there are ten more minutes of soccer to play.We hold at 1 1 until there are only two minutes remaining.Then Wes gets lucky with Georgies corner kick, heading the ball into the top of the net.And weve won.I collapse on the grass and yell for Killfeather to bring me a bottle of water.He does, but he pours some of it on my face before handing me the rest.You are such a punk, I complain, and he laughs.The walk home takes longer than it should, because the coaches are sweaty and tired.So who do you room with?I ask Killfeather.Oh, with Davies.Really?Hows that working out?Its all right, he says.Hes not bad when hes not on the ice.I file that away to think about later.And I let my eyes linger on Wes.His gait is so familiar to me.The way he carries his shoulders hasnt changed in the nine years Ive known him.The way his hamstrings tighten with each step is as familiar as my own hand.Theres a warm feeling in my belly when I look at him.And its not just sexual.Itscomfortable.Like were close even when hes twenty yards ahead.I wear a consciousness of him like a second skin.Okay, that sounds a little creepy.A little too Silence of the Lambs.Sunshine and sexual confusion have gone to my head.Just before he reaches the dormitory, I see Wes answer his phone.And when I arrive in our room a minute or so behind him, hes frowning out the window while he talks.What if I dont want to do an interview?he asks.His tone is recklessly belligerent if hes talking to a PR person.Careful, I feel like saying.This isnt a good idea.Why set me up just to lie?Theres a pause on Wess end.He kicks off his shoes with more force than is necessary, and they fly with an angry thunk into the desk we never use.Dad, if I tell them theres a girlfriend, theyre going to ask her name.And then what would you have me say?Ah.The conversation makes more sense now.Wes never got along with his father.Every phone call home had always ended with Wes red faced and irritated.The one time I met Wesley Sr., I found him to be awfully arrogant and demanding for someone who sits at a desk all day.The fact that Mr.Wesley isnt happy about his sons sexuality comes as no surprise to me at all.In front of me, Wes hunches his shoulders.Without thinking too hard about it, I step forward and put both hands there, squeezing the muscle between his neck and shoulders.I dig my thumbs into his traps and push.At first he goes rigid.Then he makes an effort to relax.And when he shoots me a little glance over his shoulder, its grateful.I gotta go, Wes is saying, his voice still grumpy.Ill think about it.But dont you dare schedule anything without my permission.He ends the call and drops the phone on the desk.Then he drops his head and leans into my touch.Thanks, man, he says gruffly.What does he want from you?I work my hands up onto the back of his neck.Would I have touched him this way yesterday?Maybe?Probably not.But it isnt sexual.He feels good under my hands, though.Warm and alive.Wes groans.Hes got a buddy at Sports Illustrated.You know himhes got a buddy everywhere.My dad came out of the womb with business cards in his hands.Hes convinced the guy to interview me about my rookie season.Likefollowing the ups and downs.Im horrified.Thats a terrible idea.In the first place, rookie seasons are wildly unpredictable.Wes could end up as a healthy scratch for two dozen games before suddenly seeing tons of play.And who wants the pressure of speaking to a reporter all the damn time?You dont want to be that rookie on the teamthe one a reporter follows around all fucking day.Wes sighs, his back rising and falling under my hands.You think?I feel a rush ofsomething for him.Solidarity.Affection.Maybe it doesnt need a title.But I wish his father hadnt meddled.What are you going to do?Lie, he says, his tone flat.Ill tell him I spoke to the Panthers PR team, and they vetoed the idea.Will he believe you?Does it matter?Yeah, I say quietly.Because you dont want to piss off Sports Illustrated before youve even sharpened your skates in Toronto.Wes makes a frustrated sound as I work my hands down his spine.My fucking father, sticking his nose where it doesnt belong again.He thinks hes helping, too.He wants his buddy to write an all American kid kind of story.Apple fucking pie and all that.Like if its printed in a magazine, he can make it true.Wes turns around suddenly, interrupting the killer massage Id been giving him.Im oddly disappointed.I enjoyed having my hands on him.I know he enjoyed it too, but his expression is shuttered again, just like it was this morning.I open my mouth.Then close it.Nope, Im still not ready to have this conversation.Neither is he, apparently.Lets grab some lunch, he suggests.I hesitate, then shake my head.You go ahead.I think Ill take a nap for a bit.Imtired after that game.Its a lame ass excuse, and I know he sees right through me.But he just nods.Yeah.Sure.Ill catch up with you later.A moment later, hes gone.18      Wes      I dont end up grabbing lunch.
