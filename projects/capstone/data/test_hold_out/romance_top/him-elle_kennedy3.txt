I snort just thinking about it.Nobody told you to eat that ice cream cone first.I was starved.Of course, I havent been able to order pistachio since.Jamie snickers as we turn toward the lake.Light green puke all over the lawn.Good times.They were, though.Id yarf on the grass every day if it meant I could go back to the easy times.Chasing Jamies big, blond body around the lake was all I wanted out of life.Okay, thats a lie.Id rather tackle him to the ground and strip off his clothing.Seeing him again is killing me right now.I have something to say, though, and it has to be soon.We run the next mile in silence as I rehearse it again.My big apology.If Jamie is horrified, its going to sting.There are kayakers on the lake, their vessels tipping with each stroke of the oar.I feel as steady as they look.So what did you want to talk about?Jamie finally asks.Theres no ducking it anymore.Im here just through July.Its best to get the preliminaries out of the way.Me too.Im supposed to be in Detroit before August first.Youre heading to Toronto, huh?You pumped?Sure.But listen I just need to say that if you dont want to room with me this summer, Ill ask Pat to move me.I wont even be offended.Jamie stops running, and I pull up short to avoid plowing into his back.Why?he asks.Here goes nothing.It all comes out in a rush.Canning, Im gay.And yeahmaybe thats not such a big deal in the grand scheme of things.Except that the last time we were here I kind ofpushed you into fooling around with me.It wasnt cool, and Ive spent the last four years feeling shitty about it.For a long moment he just gapes at me.And when he finally speaks, it isnt what I expect him to say.And?And?AndIm sorry.His face reddens.You know Im from Northern California, right?You get that I know a gay dude or ten?Uh, okay?Jamies mouth opens and then closes.And opens again.This is why you didnt call me for four years?Why you ignored my texts?Wellyes.Im so confused now.I just pled guilty to assholery in the first degree and practically molestation.And hes worried about a few texts.His face turns another shade redder.Then he takes off running again, and Im so startled that it takes me a second to chase him.Hes running faster now.He lengthens his long strides and moves his arms with power.The athletic shirt hes wearing hugs each muscle as he moves, and I am jealous of that piece of polyester fabric.The loop around Mirror Lake is a little under three miles.I dont know whats in his head as he runs the rest of it.Im a few paces behind, confused and disheartened.On our way back through town, we pass all our old hauntsthe fudge shop and the toy store that sells rubber band guns.A bakery called Miracle on Icing.I dont see Jamies face until he slows to a stop in front of the toboggan run, locked up again for the summer.I wish we could go back to a simpler time when climbing some chain link was my biggest offense.When he turns his sweaty face to me, theres still anger in it.You didnt talk to me for four years because you thought Id freak out about you sucking me off.Uhyeah.But given the resentment in his voice, its clear Id fucked up in some other way that hadnt made it into my calculus.His hands are clenched into fists.Is that how you see me?Some uptight asshole?On a bench nearby I see a young mother scoop up her toddler and walk away from us, frowning.But Jamie is on a roll.It was just a little sex, for Gods sake.Nobody died.And Im probably going to swallow my tongue now.I It was dishonest.Ah.Thanks for punishing me for your dishonesty.A four year sentence.I went off to a strange college where I knew nobody, wondering how Id been such a shitty friend.Well, fuck.Im sorry, I mumble.It sounds inadequate.To both of us, Im sure.Jamie kicks a trashcan.I need a shower.My traitorous dick volunteers to join him, but I keep my big trap shut as we walk the last block and climb the stairs.This had not gone the way Id anticipated.My worst case scenario had involved Jamie recoiling in horror at my gayness and accusing me of manipulating him into fooling around.Ive spent four years riddled with shame over what Id done, and now it turns out I shouldve felt ashamed about something entirely different.Jamie didnt care that Id blown him.He cared that Id abandoned him.And knowing Id hurt my best friend much more deeply than Id realized twists me up in knots.I hesitate at the top of the steps, calling out to his rigid back.Um, Canning?What?he mutters without turning around.Am I finding somewhere else to sleep tonight?He sighs.No, jackass.10      Jamie      Twenty two seems too old to be giving someone the silent treatment.Not that I played those sorts of games when I was younger.Ive always been a talk it out guy.Face your problems head on, dont freeze the other person out.Thats Wess specialty, freezing someone out.Can anyone say still bitter?The two of us havent really spoken since we went running.At dinner, hed sat with Pat, catching up on the last few years.Then Pat banged his spoon on a water glass and introduced Wes to the campers.Frozen Four champion and number two in the nation for points scored, and guaranteed to see some ice time in Toronto next year.The eyes of the boys around me grew wider and wider.Theyd hung on every word.Meanwhile, Wes had sat there cracking half an aw, shucks smile, looking cocky and carefree.Maybe hes not as carefree as he looks, my conscience suggests.Fuck off, conscience!Im busy being mad here.Now were in our respective beds, but neither of us is sleeping.I still wear my anger around me like the bedsheet that covers me.But its a thin layer.I hear him sigh from the other bed, and I stare up at the ceiling, wondering if I should just get over it already.His husky voice breaks the silence.I was afraid.Theres a rustling sound, and from the corner of my eye I see that hes rolled over on his side, watching me in the darkness.You?I ask.Didnt know that was possible.Not often, he concedes, and I snort.Theres more silence, but I finally give in.Afraid of what?That Id used you.And that youd hate me for it.A sigh rises in my chest.I shift onto my side too, but its hard to make out his expression in the shadows.I could never hate you, dumbass.I consider it.Well, unless you did something hate worthy, like run my mom over with a car on purpose or something.But hate you for being gay?Or for giving me a BJ without telling me you were gay?Fuck, Im still resentful as hell that he thought I was capable of being so narrow minded.But I wasnt ready to tell you the truth, he admits.Im not sure I was ready to tell myself.But deep down I knew, and I felt like such a shit afterward.I felt like, I dunno, I took advantage of you.I cant help but laugh.Dude, its not like you tied me to the bed and forced yourself on me.I dont know if you remember, but I came like a motherfucker that night.Aw shit.I dont know why I said that.And the flash of heat that travels down to my dick is equally perplexing.Thinking about that night is something I rarely let myself do.It was easily the hottest sexual experience eighteen year old Jamie Canning had ever had.But remembering it always confuses me, because I associate it with getting banished from the friendship I valued most.Oh, I remember everything about that night.His voice thickens, and the stirring down below grows stronger.I quickly initiate an emergency subject change, because talking about BJs seems to be confusing my body.So are you out now?Like officially?Do your folks know?His answering breath is heavy.Yeah, they know.I wait for him to continue.He doesnt.Which isnt much of a surprise, since Wes never liked talking about his family.I know his father is some bigshot investment banker and his mother sits on a bunch of charity committees.And the one time Wess dad had driven him to camp, I remember shaking the mans hand and thinking he was the coldest person Id ever met.Im so curious to hear what they think about having a gay son, but I know he wont answer if I ask.The thing with Wes is, everything is always on his terms.What about your teammates?I try.Toronto?With the Northern Mass guys, I had a dont ask dont tell thing going on.I didnt hide it, but I didnt talk about it, either.They left it alone.But Toronto He groans.Not sure how thats going to work.My plan is just to duck the question as long as I can.I guess Im slipping back into the closet for a while until I feel like I know those guys.Until Im so valuable to them they wont care who I screw in my spare time.That should only take three, four years tops.That sounds unbelievably rough.Im sorry.No, I'm sorry.Im sorry I fucked up our friendship, Jamie.Shit, he called me Jamie.He only does that when hes actually being serious, earnest.Regret radiates from his body and rolls toward me in palpable waves, and I feel my anger crumbling like a sandcastle in high tide.I cant stay mad at this guy.Even when I thought hed thrown our friendship away like a piece of trash, I still hadnt been able to hate him.I swallow.Water under the bridge, man.Yeah?Yeah.Letting out a slow breath, I crook my arm under my head and glance over at him.So whats been going on with you?Catch me up on the last four years.He snickers.Four years worth of Ryan Wesley shenanigans?Thatll take all night, dude.Then he pauses, his tone going awkward.Id rather hear about you, anyway.Hows the Canning clan?Still chaos central over there?I smile in the darkness.Always.Mom sold her art gallery and opened up one of those pottery places where you come in and spend the day making vases and ashtrays and shit.How many times do you think shes caught people acting out that scene from Ghost?he cracks.At least once daily, I answer solemnly.No joke.I think about what else has happened, but its hard to sift through four years of events.Oh, my sister Tammy had a baby, so Im an uncle now Um, what else Joethats my oldest brotherhe got a divorce.No shit.Wes sounds genuinely upset.Werent you best man at their wedding?He suddenly laughs.Hey, remember that bowtie I sent you to wear for the ceremony?I stifle a groan.You mean the bright red one with pink cocks all over it?Yeah, I remember.And fuck you very much, by the way.Joe was in the room when I opened the box, and he almost had a heart attack when he thought thats what I was wearing.So you let my gift go to waste?Asshole.Nope, I wore it at the bachelor party.We both snicker, and something hot and familiar clenches in my chest.Ive missed this.Talking to Wes.Laughing with Wes.The wedding was fun, I add.Me and Scott and Brady were the best men, Tammy was one of Samanthas bridesmaids, and my sister Jess got ordained and performed the ceremony.She was hilarious up there.Wes chuckles.How have you not gone insane yet, dude?I dont think Id survive having five siblings.Naah, I love it.Besides, Im the youngestby the time I came around, my parents just let me do whatever I wanted.They were exhausted from all that disciplining they had to do with my brothers and sisters.He falls silent, and I can feel the tension in the air again, as if he wants to say something but is too afraid to say it.Just spit it out, I order when his silence continues to drag.He sighs.Are we good?Yeah, Wes, were good.And I mean it.It took us four years to get back to this point, but were here now and Im happy.I have my best friend back, at least for the next six weeks.11      Wes      So this coaching thing?Its harder than it looks.At the start of the morning session, it feels easy.I set up some drills for the youngest offensive players and run em like crazy.Theres a whistle around my neck, and they have to do whatever I tell them.Easy money, right?Not so fast.When I take on a scrimmage for the older teens, all the wheels fall off.Its not that the kids are no good.Their skill levels vary from awesome to virtuosic.But they dont work in sync like a college team.Theyre headstrong and irrational.They listen to what I say, and then they go do the opposite.Theyre teenagers.And after ten minutes of play Im basically beating my head against the plexi, praying for my own death.Pat, I beg.Please tell me I wasnt like this.You werent, he says with a shake of his head.You were three times worse.Then that traitor has the balls to exit the building, leaving me in charge of thirty sweating hormone crazed teenage hockey punks.I blow my whistle for the millionth time.Offsides!Again.Seriously?I ask Shen, an arrogant D man whos been torturing the goalie for my whole session.The two of them have some kind of vendetta against each other, and it isnt helping the general chaos.Faceoff.Play starts again when I drop the puck.I look up to see Canning walking down the chute to assist me with the scrimmage.Thank Christ.His calm face is like a cool drink of water.I skate over and hop the wall to greet him.Why didnt you tell me this job was hard?He grins, and my heart melts a little in the usual way.Whats hard?Youre not even sweating.I am, though.Because even as I turn my head to watch my players, Shen goes sliding backward into the goalie hes been taunting, knocking him over.It looks intentional, and Canning must have thought so too, because were both scissoring over the wall to get over there.What the starts Killfeather, the goalie.Shen smirks.Sorry.Fucking chink, Killfeather swears.Faggot, Shen returns.My whistle is so loud that Canning claps his hands over his ears.Two minute penalties!I roar.Both of you.What?Killfeather yelps.I didnt touch his ass.For your mouth, I snarl.On my ice you dont use a slur of any kind.I point toward the sin bin.Get.But Killfeather doesnt move.You dont get to make new rules.His sneer is as big as the banner advertisements lining the boards.All the players are listening, so I cant do this wrong.Ladies, it is a rule.Two minute bench minor for unsportsmanlike conduct.If youd kept your trap shut after he hit you, your team would have a power play right now.Im doing this for your own good.Sure you are.In spite of that parting shot, both my troublemakers finally aim their bodies toward the penalty boxes.So I issue my parting shot, and I make sure that everyone can hear.By the wayscience has proven the correlation between calling someone a faggot and having a really small penis.You do not want to advertise that.Think about it.Canning doesnt say anything.But he skates off, too.I see him take a seat off to the side and then bend over as if hes retying his skates.Whatever, right?But then I see his back shaking.At least somebody gets my jokes.The rest of the scrimmage lasts about a decade.When we finally break for lunch, Jamie catches up to me on the way to the locker rooms.Science has proven?He chuckles.I do science on the side.Uh huh.Im thinking of skipping the dining hall today and grabbing a burger at the pub in town.You down?Fuck yeah, I answer.Then I wince and glance around to make sure none of the kids are lurking around.I dont know if Im cut out to be an authority figure.Ive spent four years surrounded by Northern Mass hockey players who drop F bombs in every sentence, and I keep forgetting I need to censor myself while Im at Elites.The teenagers here swear like sailorsat least when Pat and the other coaches arent aroundbut I refuse to corrupt the younger ones with my filthy mouth.Fudge yeah, I correct.Canning gestures at the emptiness around us.Were the only ones here.You can say fuck, dumbass.You can say anything, really.With a grin, he unleashes a string of expletives.Fuck, shit, cock, pussy  For the love of Christ!a loud voice booms from behind us.Do I need to wash your mouth out with soap, Canning?I choke down my laughter as Pat appears.He shakes his head in disbelief as he stares at Jamie, then narrows his eyes and turns to me.Actually, what am I saying?Canning wouldnt even know those words if it werent for you, Wesley.Shame on you.I flash Pat an innocent smile.Im pure as the driven snow, Coach.Canning was the one who corrupted me.They both snort.Pat claps me on the shoulder and stalks past us.Yeah, keep telling yourself that, kid, he says over his shoulder.And both of you, watch your mouths around the campers or Ill kick your motherfucking asses.Jamie and I are still laughing as we duck into the locker room to ditch our skates and change into our sneakers.When we exit the building a few minutes later, I feel like Ive just left an icy pool and stepped into a sauna.The humidity in the air is stifling, causing sweat to roll down my back.My T shirt sticks to my chest like plastic wrap.Shrugging, I yank it over my head and tuck the fabric in the waistband of my gym shorts.The atmosphere in Lake Placid is as casual as it getsnobodys gonna care if I walk through town rocking a bare chest.Canning keeps his shirt on.I think I might prefer it that way, because his shirt is paper thin and doing the same clinging thing mine had done, which gives me a decadent view of every hard ripple on his broad chest.Fuck, Im yet again jealous of his shirt.I want to be the one plastered to his chest, and the ache I feel for him brings a spark of guilt.Were good now.Were friends again.So why cant my traitorous body just be cool with it?Why cant I look at him without imagining all the dirty, dirty things I want to do to him?So whats the deal with you and that girl?I hear myself ask.I dont particularly want to hear the answer, but I need the wake up call itll bring, the reminder that lusting over this guy is a disaster waiting to happen.Holly?He shrugs.Nothing, really.We just hook up.Or rather, we used to hook up.I dont think Ill be seeing much of her now that weve graduated.I arch a brow.Just a hook up?Since when are you into a friends with bennies arrangement?Another shrug.It was convenient.Fun.I dont know.Im just not looking to settle down with anyone right now.Holly understood that.His voice takes on a note of challenge.What, you disapprove?Nah, Im all about fuck buddies.We pass the toy store and duck out of the way of two moms pushing strollers.Both women swivel their heads in my direction and stare at my tats.Not with contempt, but intrigue.It happens again on the next block when a group of teenage girls stop in their tracks at the sight of me.The words tattooed hottie tickle our backs as we walk past.Jamie chuckles.You sure you dont want to go the bisexual path?Cause Im pretty sure you wont have any trouble in the chick department.Sall good.Wouldnt be fair to the straight guys if I threw my hat in the pussy ring.They wouldnt stand a chance.His expression turns thoughtful.Ive seen you fool around with girls before.You seemed interested.I know hes thinking about all those nights we snuck into town and flirted with the locals.But we were fifteen, maybe sixteen then, and I was still experimenting, figuring things out.Were you just pretending to enjoy it?he asks curiously.Not so much pretending as trying to enjoy it, I admit.And it wasnt awful.I didnt go home afterward and scour my skin off in the shower.Making out with those girls was I dont knowit just was.I did it, it was all right, but its not like I was dying to rip their clothes off and get inside them.The way Im dying to rip your clothes off and get inside you.I clench my teeth, annoyed with myself.Christ, enough.Its not going to happen with Canning.I need to stop this.Got it.He nods, then tips his head.Who does it for you, then?Like, whats your type, looks wise?You.Ah, Im not picky.We reach the corner pub, but he doesnt make a move to open the door.He just lingers on the sidewalk and chuckles.Really.So youll just stick your dick in anyone?No, I concede.It feels so fucking weird discussing this with him.Im not crazy about twinks, I guess.I dont like the whole scrawny, young boy vibe.So you like em big.A broad grin fills his face as he winks at me.So to speak.I roll my eyes.Yeah, bigs a nice bonus.Tall, athletic, not too hairy That makes him snicker.and, I dont know I start to laugh.You seriously want to hear all this?His eyes flash with hurt.Why, because youre talking about guys instead of girls?I already told you, Im not some uptight prude who  Thats not what I meant, I cut in hastily, and he relaxes slightly.Itd be weird even if I was describing a chick.Like, what two guys stand around describing their perfect sexual partner?I widen my eyes and look around.Did we wander onto the set of Sex and the City?If so, Im Samantha.Called it.The tension diffuses instantly, as Cannings lips twitch uncontrollably.You know actual character names from Sex and the City?Shit, if you hadnt told me you were gay, I wouldve figured it out just now.That was an extremely insensitive case of stereotyping, Jamie, I say primly.Just for that?Youre springing for lunch.Asshole.But Im grinning to myself as I flip him the bird and stride into the bar.12      Jamie      Sunday is the day the coaches have off.Pats wife usually takes the kids on an outing.Theyre all going fishing on East Lake tomorrow morning.Meanwhile, the coaches usually have a drunken Saturday night followed by a sleep in on Sunday.Weve just eaten a six oclock dinner with all our teenage charges, so were officially free.Wes has been at camp for four days now, but were usually too beat at night to do anything but chill in our room.So Im going a little stir crazy.What should we do tonight?I ask Wes, who is lying on his bed.You have a car, right?Lets put er to use.My car is a dude, he says, swiping through some app.Of course it is.What are you doing, anyway?The app keeps making a strange notification sound thats unfamiliar to me.Checking out Brandr.Pretty entertaining in a small town.That shuts me up for a moment.Brandr is a gay hook up app.Im suddenly ornery because I just assumed we were going out tonight.Together.Maybe that was a stupid assumption, but thats how it always was before.So I clear my throat.How does that work?He chuckles.Come here and see.Its hysterical.All the worst traits of humanity on display in one place.Intrigued now, I sit down on his bed, and he props himself on an elbow to show me.Were leaning over the phone together, the same way we did when we were teenagers.Except we havent been on a bed together sincewell.That night.And Im conscious of the fact that we dont fit so well.Were taking up most of the surface, but Im still practically sitting on top of him.I can feel the crinkle of his leg hair brushing mine when he leans in to show me the screen.Its like a menu board.Each picture is a dude.Some of the pictures are close ups but some are impossible to see.Theres a number tagging each one, too.0.7 mi.and 1.3 mi.It tells you how close everybody is?Thats a little creepy.Thats part of the fun.If someone acts creepy, you can just block them forever.One click and theyre history.The bios are the funny part.Check this out.He taps one of the tiles and some dudes picture fills the screen.It says: Online now, 0.9 mi away.Hes too old for you, I say immediately.And whats with the socks?The guy has gray hair and leans against a red convertible.Hes in decent shape, but nobody should wear socks that tall with shorts.Thats just wrong.I wont lie.This is weirding me outthe idea that this man is staring down at his screen somewhere on the other end of town, tapping Wess picture...Wes just laughs.Looking at Brandr in a small town is always amusing.The odds are good, but the goods are odd.He scrolls the picture to the bottom where the guy has added his 140 characters or whatever.The headline is Looking 2 get naked with muscles.And below that: If Im online then Im lkng to get naked.Kissing, body contact & more just ask.No fems.Sorry only attracted to whites.What the fuck?I stutter.Sounds like a charmer, doesnt he?Thats the internet for you.Wes bails out of that jerks profile.But then his phone makes a noise and a little window pops up.Hey, it says, and theres a thumbnail of some other guy beside it.Someones talking to you, I mutter.And now I hate this app more than I thought possible.Competing for my friends attention isnt fun.So I stand up and shuck off my Elites T shirt.Im getting out of here tonight whether Wes comes along or not.I pull on a polo shirt, which is as dressy as a guy ever gets in Lake Placid.You want to head out?he asks from the bed.Yeah.When I turn around, hes changing his clothes, too.Thank Christ.To think that we can be out after dark without climbing out of the windows, Wes cracks.Thats just weird.Hes dressed in hiking shorts and boots, and pulling a black wife beater over his head, leaving his arms bare.You can jump off the fire escape if you want, I tell him.But Im taking the stairs.Where are we headed?I grab my keys and phone.If your manly car is available, lets go to Owls Head.He stops in the middle of tying his shoelaces.Yeah?I thought wed go to a bar.Were going to do both, I say.But only if you can move your ass out that door.Wes drives a newish Honda Pilot with a sweet stereo and leather seats.But its a mess.I have to move several copies of USA Hockey off the passengers seat and throw away an old McDonalds bag.This is...nice, I tease as I chase an empty cup off the floor.Im not going to gay up my ride for you, Canning.Lets go.Were racing the daylight.Owls Head is a short hike we used to do with the group as campers.Its a few miles out of town, and there arent any other cars at the trailhead when we arrive.Wes bleeps the locks, and then were scrambling uphill over rocks and tree roots.I love this.Hockey is great, but it keeps you indoors.My summer sport is surfing, but Ive always loved a good hike.Did I mention Im from California?Slow down, Wes pants at one point.I stop, holding on to a sapling to wait for him.Too much for Torontos recruit to handle?Id better call my bookie.Who are you playing first?He smacks me on the ass.I stopped to take a picture, asshole.Carry on.The views really are intense.Were climbing up a ledge, basically, and Adirondack peaks stand out all around us, dark against the early evening sky.Its just two more turns, I promise.It takes us thirty minutes to reach the bald, rocky outcroppings at the top just as the sun prepares to set behind a distant peak.Panting a little from the climb, I plop down on a sun warmed rock and take it in.What a dump, Wes jokes, sitting beside me.Right?Ive probably climbed this hill every summer for the last nine years.When we were fourteen, it was fun to scare each other by sitting way out on the ledge.When we were seventeen, we probably came all the way up here without really seeing it.Wes and I would have been arguing about hockey.Or football.Or some dumbass movie.We climbed because that was the activity on the days itinerary.It had startled me this past year to realize everything I did from here on out I did for myself.College graduation is the end of the road map.Its all uncharted territory from this point, and Im the one in the drivers seat.The distant clouds turn orange pink while I watch.My friend sits beside me, lost in his own thoughts.Were going to lose the light, he says eventually.We still have time.Another beat of silence goes by before I ask, What are you thinking about, anyway?He chuckles.Freshman year of college.What a dick I was to everyone.Yeah?Im surprised Wes is going all introspective like me.I would have thought he was sitting there trying to figure out the best way to prank Pat and blame it on the kids.Yeah.Rough year.Lots of hazing.I sneak a look at him for the first time since we sat down.Same here.Those seniors were psycho, seriously.Never seen anything like it.I clear my throat.That fall I kept thinking, Wes is not going to believe this shit when I tell him I let the sentence die.That was probably too harsh.If were friends again, I shouldnt let my anger bubble back to the surface.He makes an irritated sound in the back of his throat.Sorry.I know, I say quickly.But I spent that first semester just praying those assholes didnt figure out I liked dick.And since I wasnt so comfortable with that idea myself He sighs.I wasnt very good company that year, anyway.Something goes a little wrong in my stomach at the idea of Wes being scared.My whole life Id thought of him as fearless.Nobody is.Intellectually I know that.But even the other night when hed told me he had struggled with being gay.I dont think I really got it.That sucks, I say softly.He shrugs.Didnt kill me.Just made me work twice as hard.Maybe I wouldnt have ended up as a first liner if those jackasses hadnt put the fear of God into me every fucking day.Thats looking on the bright side.Canning, were going to lose the daylight, he reminds me.Hes right.The sky has already faded to a soft purple in some places.I hastily stand up.Lets go, then.Its counterintuitive, but on a steep hike the way down is much harder than the way up.Every step threatens to sweep your feet out from under you.We dont speak at all during our descent.Were too busy concentrating on where to place each foot and which branches will make a steadying hand hold.The dark is coming on fast.Were almost there when the path becomes truly difficult to see.I can hear Wess footfalls behind me, and the skittering sound of the pebbles he displaces with each step.Id bet cash money that Wes is in the zone like I am right now, thinking only of the task at hand.When the body is busy, the mind shuts up for a while.Its almost totally dark, but I know were just yards from the trailhead.Thats when I hear Wes stumble.Theres a grunt and the sound of feet sliding on dirt.My heart catches as I hear him go down a few paces behind me.Fuck, he grumbles.I turn around and find him splayed out on the ground.Shit.Ive dragged Torontos new forward up a fucking mountain in the dark.If hes sprained something, its all on me.You okay?Feeling sick, I make my way uphill again to where he is.Yeah, he says, but thats not proof.A hockey player always says that, even when its not true.But then Wes sits up from the shadows.I stick out a hand and he closes his fingers around it and squeezes.The pressure of his grasp calms me down.With a tug from me hes on his feet again, and the warmth of his hand leaves mine.But I dont turn around and head down yet.Seriously, did you twist anything?The shadow of Wes shifts his weight from one foot to the other and back again.Nope.Banged my knee on a rock.But its nothing.He scrapes his hands together to dust them off.Letting out a breath I dont even know Im holding, I turn around and pick my way even more slowly down the hill.Wess car waits for us in the dark.I hop into the passenger seat, relieved that my hike hasnt injured anyone.The dome light shows me a smiling Wes, but theres dirt on his shirt.I reach over and brush it off, undoing the damage.He gives me a wink.You copping a feel?Laughing at his own joke, he cranks the engine.Where are we headed?Anyplace.Your pick.Wes turns the car around and heads back to the main road.We passed a bar before this turnoff.Lous, or something.You ever been there?I shake my head.Never have wheels, so I always drink in town.Well give it a try, he says.13      Jamie      There are a million cars outside Lous because the place shares a parking lot with a Dairy Queen.We park on the road and walk through the cricket filled darkness to the decently sized roadside bar.Lous has an Adirondack theme, and theyre working it pretty hard.The requisite old wooden paddles hang from the paneled walls.An inverted canoe is suspended on hooks from the ceiling.The drink specials are named for nearby peaks.Of course they are.Okay, so youll have the Nippletop, and Ill have the Dix Mountain.Wes is already enjoying himself.Dude, if the Nippletop has peach schnapps in it, I will hurt you.He grins, and its wicked.How do you feel about elderflower vodka?Not funny.I wave down the bartender.Ill have a Saranac IPA.Thanks.Wes flips the drink menu onto the bar.Make that two, please.He puts a twenty down, and when I reach for my wallet, he waves me off.Ill get these.We take our beers to a high table, both of us doing a little people watching.I dont see any girls I want to chat up, but thats fine because thats not what I came here for, anyway.Wes fishes his phone out of his pocket.Should have shut this thing off, he says.Then he squints at the screen.What?Its a Brandr notification.Somebodys trying to chat me.And it says less than 100 feet away.I almost choke on a swallow of my beer.Some guy in here?Then Im swiveling my head in every direction, wondering who it is.Wes kicks me under the table.Cut that out.But its too late.At the far end of the room, theres a guy in a Fugees T shirt looking this way.Hes watching me.Then he smiles.Oh, fuck, I hiss out.Wes is laughing.Dude, you just picked up a guy.What?Im sweating now.And I cant beat the crap out of my best friend because the guy has almost reached our table.Hey, he says, giving me a grin.Then he looks at Wes.Wait.He chuckles.Which of you?Oh my fucking God.Its my profile, Wes says, and I can tell hes trying very hard not to bust a gut.You like?You fishing for compliments?The guy winks.Hes a few years older than us, with dark, shiny hair.I need another beer.Can I buy a round?Im good, I say quickly.One for you, then, he says, pointing at Wes.Then he slips away to the bar.When hes gone, Wes puts his face in his hands and laughs.Jesus, the look on your face!Ugh.Why did he think it was me, anyway?My face isnt in my profile pic.Wes can hardly speak for laughing.I realize something.You didnt show me your profile.No kidding, he says, getting a hold of himself finally.Not showing you that.Why?When he shrugs, I suddenly wonder if Is it a dick pic?Another burst of laughter shudders out of his mouth.Abs, he croaks.Its my abs.Of course it is.Wess new friend drifts back to our table, sliding a bottle in front of Wes, whos barely made a dent in his current one.We spend the next few minutes chatting.Well, they chat.I just listen, feeling uneasy.Theres something kindasleazy about the whole thing, about this guy, but maybe Im just grumpy.I wanted to hang out with my best friend tonight, not watch him eye fuck some other dude.I teach second grade at the public school, the guys telling Wes.His name is Sam, and its a little hard to hate him now that I know he works with kids.He seems decent.And hes really good looking.Not Wes good looking or anything, butJesus.Am I seriously sitting here comparing the level of attractiveness of the two guys beside me?I take a deep gulp of my beer.Screw it.If Im going to be the third wheel tonight, I might as well get wasted.Pool tables available, Sam says, gazing across the room.You guys up for a game?Sure, Wes answers for us, and I swallow down my irritation with another swig of beer.Ill just watch, I mutter as we reach the table.Not in the mood to shoot pool.Wes eyes me for a moment.All right.Sam racks the balls and flashes Wes a grin.Looks like its you and me.For the sake of full disclosure, Im about to kick your ass.This guy doesnt know Wes, though.I used to watch my buddy hustle every unsuspecting sap whod ever challenged him to a game.Wes smiles sheepishly.Yeah, you might be right about that.Im not very good.I stifle a snort.You want me to break?Sam offers.Wes nods.His gaze meets mine briefly, and I see the twinkle in his eye before he turns away.I lean against the wood paneled wall as Sam bends over at the far end of the table, the pool cue positioned skillfully in his hands.His opening shot sends the balls scattering in a dizzying whirl, but he only lands onesolid red in the side pocket.He sticks with solids, sinking one more before missing the next shot.Wes is up.He studies the table with a frown, as if he cant decide which shot to take.Bullshit.Like his shrewd brain hasnt already planned out every single shot all the way up to the sinking of the eight ball.Sam sidles up to him, lightly resting his hand on Wess shoulder.I narrow my eyes.Handsy motherfucker, aint he?Go for the eleven, Sam advises.Corner pocket.Wes bites his lip.I was thinking the thirteen.Which would require a combo shot that would make even the most advanced billiards players sweat.Sam chuckles.That might be a bit too difficult considering youre not  Wes takes the shot before Sam can finish the sentence.He sinks the thirteen.And the nine.And the twelve.In one impressive combo that makes Sams jaw hit the floor.I cant help it.I start to laugh.Youre not very good, huh?Sam sighs heavily.Wess mouth twitches.I may have underplayed my level of proficiency.A part of me hopes Sam is one of those sensitive egomaniacs who cant handle losing, but Mr.I Teach Second Grade seems delighted by Wess awesomeness.He simply stands there and whistles as my buddy circles the table like the pool shark he is, even breaking out in applause after Wes cleans the table without once letting Sam take another shot.Sam accepts his defeat by chugging the rest of his beer, then slamming the empty bottle on the ledge behind the pool table.Another one?he asks Wes.Wes glances at me as if to check if Im cool with it.I just shrug.I know theres no prying Sam away from Wes right now.Hes too fucking enamored with my buddy.They play another game.I order another beer.They play a third game.I order a third beer.The drunker I get, the handsier they get.Sams palm grazes the small of Wess back as he leans in to line up his next shot.Wes glances over his shoulder and winks at Sam, his gray eyes gleaming.Eventually I wander back to the table, alcohol buzzing in my bloodstream as annoyance builds in my gut.Fuck this Sam guy.I take it backhes not decent.He seems to have no problem monopolizing my best friends time.Doesnt even give a shit that theyre both ignoring me.And he wont stop touching Wes.My fingers curl around the beer bottle.When Sam steps closer to Wes and whispers something in his ear, my knuckles turn white as my grip tightens.Is he asking Wes if he wants to get out of here?Telling him how much he wants to screw him right now?Offering to blow him in the bathroom?I drain the rest of my beer.Yeah, Im buzzing hard now.And the alcohol has done something to my brain.Short circuited it somehow, flooded it with memories I dont usually allow to surface.The soundtrack of that last day at camp four years ago runs through my mind.What are you waiting for, Ryan?Suck it already.Fuck, Wes, youre making me come.It bothers me that I remember every word I said to him.Ive been on the receiving end of some pretty phenomenal blowjobs these past four years, but can I tell you what was said during them?Can I repeat, verbatim, every single word I uttered to those chicks?To Holly?Every dirty command that left my mouth?No, I cant.My gaze shifts back to the pool table, locking on Wess mouth.My dick stirs, remembering that mouth wrapped around it.Shit, maybe Im more drunk than buzzed.Sam and Wess laughter wafts toward me.Looks like Sam finally won a game, and knowing Wes, hes taunting the guy about it being a fluke.Or hell, maybe Wes let him win.Maybe he decided to throw the guy a bone before hethrows the guy a bone.My chest goes rigid.The thought of Wes hooking up with someone tonight pisses me off.Jealous?a little voice mocks.Screw that.Im not fucking jealous.I dont care what Wes doesor who he doesbut we were supposed to hang out tonight.Me and him.Not him and some random guy he met through a hook up app.I abruptly hop off my stool and make my way back to the pool table.Theyre not even playing anymore, just standing close together, chuckling about something.Sams hand rests on Wess hip.A casual gesture.Light, harmless.But it sparks resentment in my gut.Why the hell is he touching him?He doesnt even know him.Presumptuous asshole.Ready to go?I raise my voice, because neither of them notices me standing there.Wes blinks.Now?I answer through clenched teeth.Yes.I want to take off.I cant help but offer a cool look.Youre my ride, remember?Wariness floats through his expression.Then he gives a quick nod and turns to Sam.Thanks for the games, man.Looks like were taking off now.The other guys disappointment is impossible to miss.He glances at me, then back at Wes.Uh, yeahsure.Let me just grab your number before you go?Asshole.I grind my molars as I watch them exchange numbers.Well then.I guess theyre going to meet up again.So much for getting to spend the summer reconnecting with my best friend.Wes doesnt say anything as we head for the exit.The music in the bar had been too loud to hear what was happening outside, but when we step out the door, we find ourselves in the middle of a torrential downpour.A cold gust of rain slaps me in the face, soaking my clothes in seconds.Shit.Run to the car?I shout over the deafening pounding of the rain hitting the pavement.Wes stays put.His expression is as thunderous as the weather.What the hell was that?I can barely hear him over the wind and rain.What?You acted like a total douchecanoe in there.Then he stalks away, his boots splashing the puddles forming on the asphalt.The little awning spanning the side of the building does nothing to protect us from the rain.Our clothes are plastered to our bodies.Water clings to my hair and drips down my face as I hurry after him.I was the one acting like a douchecanoe?I yell after him.He stops, spins around to face me.Yes.Jesus, dude, the way you treated that guy, youd think he was carrying the Ebola virus.Maybe I just didnt appreciate the way he was pawing you right in front of me!I shoot back.
