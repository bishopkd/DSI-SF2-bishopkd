The family, especially the father, wanted him to be charged with a Class C felony, which could have put him behind bars for anywhere between three and seven years.The arresting officer, too, believed that Laws was dangerous.But unfortunately, the district attorney didnt think we could prove intent, since there was no proof that any of the things in the car had anything to do with her.Nor were her injuries truly life threatening.Cassie also had a bit of a credibility problem while most of what shed said Laws had done in the past was true, she also said hed done things that he clearly hadnt.Then there was Laws: He looked like Mister Rogers, worked as a loan officer at a bank, and had no criminal record.He would have been a prosecutors nightmare on the stand.So we ended up allowing Laws to plead guilty to misdemeanor assault, with a year in prison, and thats where I went wrong.Because Laws was extremely dangerous.She paused, willing herself to keep telling the story.Laws ended up serving nine months, since hed already served three months pending trial.He wrote Cassie letters every other day, apologizing for his actions and begging for another chance.She never answered them; after a while, she didnt even open them, but she saved them all because she was still afraid of him.Afterwards, when we examined them more closely, we noticed the shift in tone over time.Laws was becoming more and more angry that she wouldnt respond.Had she actually read them and brought them to the DA  She stared toward the sand.As soon as he got out, Laws showed up at her door.She slammed the door on him and called the police.She had a restraining order filed against him, and when the police talked to him, he promised that he wouldnt go anywhere near her again.All that did was make him more careful.He sent her flowers anonymously.Her cat was poisoned.Shed find bouquets of dead roses on her doorstep.Even her tires were slashed.Maria swallowed, visibly shaken.When she continued, her voice was hoarse.And then, one night, while Cassie was heading to her boyfriends place  by then, she was dating someone else  Laws was waiting for her.Her boyfriend saw Laws grab her right off the sidewalk and force her into the car, and he wasnt able to stop it.Two days later, the police found Cassies body in an old lakefront cabin the bank had foreclosed on.Laws tied her up and beat her extensively, set the cabin on fire, and then shot himself, but they couldnt tell whether shed been alive when the fire She closed her eyes.They had to be identified through dental records.Knowing that she was reliving the past and trying to work through it, Colin remained quiet.I went to her funeral, she said, finally going on.I know I probably shouldnt have, but I felt like I needed to go.I came in after it started and sat in the back row.The church was full, but I could still see the family.The mom couldnt stop crying.She was almost hysterical, and the father and the brother were just white.I was sick to my stomach and I wanted the whole thing to be over.But it wasnt.She turned toward him.It destroyed the family.I mean, all of them were a little strange, but it turned into a catastrophe.A few months after the murder, Cassies mom committed suicide, then the father had his medical license suspended.I always thought there was something a little weird about the brother anyway, thats when these terrible notes started to arrive.They came to my apartment and the office, in different envelopes, usually just a sentence or two.They were awful calling me names, demanding to know why I hated Cassie or why I wanted to hurt the family.The police talked to the brother and the notes stopped.For a while, anyway, but when they started arriving again, they were different.More threatening.Way scarier.So the police talked to him again, and I guess he just snapped.Denied that he was responsible and insisted that I was out to get him, that the police were in cahoots with me.He ended up in a psychiatric hospital.Meanwhile, the fathers threatening to sue me.The police theorized that Cassies boyfriend might be responsible for the notes.Of course, when the police talked to him, he denied sending them, too.Thats when the panic attacks started.I had the sense that whoever was sending those notes would never leave me alone and thats when I knew I had to go home.Colin said nothing.He knew there was nothing he could say that would make her view the events she had just described in a different light.I should have listened to the family.And the officer.Colin stared out at the waves, their rhythm ceaseless and soothing.When he didnt respond, she turned toward him.Dont you think?He chose his words carefully.Its hard to answer that question.What do you mean?By the way you said it, its clear that you already think the answer is yes, but if I agree with you, youll probably feel worse.If I say no, youll dismiss my answer because youve already decided that the answer should be yes.She opened her mouth to protest, then closed it.Im not even sure what to say to that, she offered.You dont have to say anything.She sighed, resting her chin on her knees.I should have lobbied the DA and insisted that we charge Laws with a felony.Maybe.But even if you had  and even if Laws was in prison longer  the outcome might still have been the same.He was fixated on her.And if youre curious, if Id been in your shoes, I probably would have done the same thing.I know, but  Have you talked to anyone about this?Like a therapist?No.He nodded.Okay.Youre not going to tell me that I should?I dont give advice, he said.Ever?He shook his head.Then again, you dont need my advice.If you think therapy might help you, try it out.If you dont think so, dont.I can only say that in my own experience, its been beneficial.Maria was quiet, and he couldnt tell whether she liked his answer.Thanks, she finally said.For what?For listening, she said.And not trying to give advice.Colin nodded, studying the horizon.More stars were evident now, and Venus glowed in the southern sky, bright and constant.A handful of people had wandered to the beach, their laughter carrying into the night air.Sitting beside Maria, it seemed like hed known her far longer than the hour or so theyd spent together.He felt a distinct stab of regret that the evening was about to end.But he could sense it coming in the way she suddenly sat straighter.He watched as she drew a long breath before finally glancing toward the boardwalk.I should probably get going, she said.Me too, he agreed, trying to hide his reluctance.I still have to make it to the gym tonight.They rose from their spot and he watched as she brushed off the sand before slipping her sandals back on.They started back toward the dunes bordering the commercial strip, the music growing louder with every step.By the time they left the sand and were back on solid ground, the sidewalks were thronged, the crowds already enjoying their Saturday night.He stayed at her side, weaving between pedestrians until they reached the street, where things were quieter.Surprising him, she stayed close, their shoulders occasionally brushing.The sensation of her touch continued to linger.What are your plans for tomorrow?he finally asked.On Sundays, I always have brunch with my parents.After that, Ill probably go paddleboarding.Yeah?Its fun.Have you ever done it?No, he said.Ive always wanted to try, but I just havent gotten around to it yet.Too busy doing real workouts?Too lazy, he admitted.She smiled.How about you?Are you working?No, he said.Ill run, do some yard work, change the alternator on my car.Its still not starting right.Maybe its the battery.Dont you think I would have checked that first?I dont know.Would you?He heard the teasing in her tone.So after the manly yard and car work, whats on the rest of your agenda?Ill hit the gym.Theres a class that meets on Sunday mornings, and Ill probably do some sparring and ground work, hit the bags, things like that.A guy named Todd Daly runs the gym, and he tends to work us pretty hard.Hes a retired UFC fighter, coaches like a drill sergeant.But if you had to, you could probably take him, right?Daly?Not a chance.She liked the fact that he admitted it.And after that?Nothing, really.Ill probably do some studying.By then, theyd turned onto another street, around the corner from Crabby Petes.He recognized her car up ahead from the night hed changed her tire, and when they finally reached it, neither seemed to know what to say.Instead, he felt her eyes zeroing in on him, almost like she was really seeing him for the first time.Thanks for walking me to my car.Thanks for the walk on the beach.She lifted her chin slightly.I have another question.Okay.Were you serious about wanting to try paddleboarding?Yes.She lowered her lashes, slipping him a sidelong glance.Would you like to join me tomorrow?Yes, he said, feeling a dart of unexpected pleasure.Id like that.What time?How about two oclock?And well check out Masonboro Island?Its kind of hard to get to, but its worth it.Sounds great.Where should we meet?The parking isnt ideal.The only way to get there is to head down Wrightsville Beach, right to the very end of the island.Just park on the street.Bring some quarters because youll have to feed the meter, but Ill meet you there.Can I rent a board somewhere?You dont have to.I have two of them.You can use my beginner board.Great.Its hot pink, though.With stickers of bunnies and flowers on it.Really?She giggled.I was kidding.Then: I had a strangely good time tonight.Me too, he said, meaning it.And Im looking forward to tomorrow.After she unlocked the car, he opened the door, watching as she slid in.A moment later, she was backing out and then pulling away as Colin stood in place.It might have ended there, but she suddenly stopped the car and rolled down the window, leaning out.Hey, Colin?she called out.Yeah?When youre in your sparring class tomorrow morning?Try not to get hit in the face.He smiled, watching as her car sailed up the boulevard, wondering what he was getting himself into.He hadnt expected her invitation, and as he made his way back to his Camaro, he replayed the evening, trying to figure it out.Whatever her reason, he couldnt deny the fact that hed been pleased.He wanted to see her again.No question about it.CHAPTER 6      Maria      I  knew youd like him!Serena crowed.Was I right or what?It was Sunday morning, and as usual, Maria was with her sister on the back porch while their mom was finishing up breakfast.Their father was walking Copo, who was fluffed and clean, with a pink bow near her ear.I didnt say I liked him, Maria answered.I said he was interesting.But you also said youre meeting him today.In your bikini.Im not going to be wearing my bikini while Im paddleboarding.Why not?Because Im not you, okay?It would make me uncomfortable.Well, you better show some skin, because believe me, youre going to want him to take his shirt off.The whole sneaking a peek thing needs to work both ways.I dont want him to get the wrong idea.Youre right.You should probably wear some baggy sweats or something like that.And no matter how youre dressed, Im just glad youre finally going on a date.Dont try to make this into something that it isnt.Its not a date.Were just going paddleboarding.Uh huh.Serena nodded.Whatever you say.I dont know why I even try to talk to you about these things.You talk to me because you know Ill tell you the truth.Which is why, of course, the two of you hit it off so well.Because Colin is just like me.Yes, of course.Youre right.Im essentially going out with my younger sister.Dont blame me.Im not the one who followed him out to the pier.I didnt follow him out to the pier!Serena giggled.Youre so touchy these days.But if you want my advice, Id wear a bikini under the baggy sweats, okay?Just in case it gets too hot out there.Because its going to be warm today.Can we talk about you instead?Like how the rest of your evening went?Theres not much to tell.We hit the bars, went to a party.Just a typical Saturday night.Hows it going with Steve?Hes a little clingy, and Im not sure Im ready for something like that.But back to Colin again.Hes seriously hot.Yes, I noticed.Did he try to kiss you good bye?No.And I didnt want him to.Thats good, she said, keep playing hard to get.Guys like that.Maria made a face and Serena giggled again.Okay, okay, Ill stop.I think its great, though.You not only have a date  a real date, no matter how you describe it  but youre the one who asked him.Youre the epitome of the modern woman.And just so you know, Im totally jealous that youre going to get to see him with his shirt off.I dont think he has an ounce of fat on him.I really couldnt tell you.It was kind of dark and he was walking beside me.I want pictures today.You always bring that camera with you anyway.Just sneak a few of him.No.I would think that you could do at least this one little thing for your baby sister, who also happens to be the one to set you up with him.She thought about it.Okay, maybe.Awesome.Or better yet, take some with your phone and send them to me and Ill put them on Instagram.Not a chance.Are you sure?Id hate to have to tell Dad youre going out with an ex con whos currently on probation.Dont you dare!I was kidding!I dont even want to be in the same state when you drop that little bombshell.So warn me in advance, okay?Will do.Still, you should get a selfie with him at the very least.Before the announcement.That way, youll know you actually went out with him, since itll never happen again after that.Are you done?Serena giggled.Yes.Now Im done.Maria noticed a hummingbird sipping from the feeder her mother had hung, hovering in a way that had mesmerized her since she was a young girl.From inside, she could hear her mother quietly singing to herself, and while the aroma of eggs and refried beans should have been making her hungry, she was already a little nervous about the upcoming afternoon.She wondered how much shed actually be able to eat.Im still kind of surprised at the way he just told you everything, Serena finally offered.Had you been there, you would have been in shock.Trust me.Its weird, though.I dont think Ive ever met anyone like that before.Youre telling me.Two hours later, Maria was at home, debating what to wear.Serenas advice sounded in her ear, making the decision a lot more difficult than it should have been.Normally she wouldnt think twice about it; shed wear shorts and either a halter or a bikini top, and she certainly wouldnt have showered beforehand or put on makeup or felt the clawing pangs of nervousness in her belly, but there they were.Standing in front of her chest of drawers, she debated what kind of impression she wanted to make.Bold?Casual?Sexy?It was a whole lot easier for men, she decided: Throw on a T shirt, flip flops, and shorts and head out the door.Meanwhile, she had to debate the length of her shorts, and decide how tight or faded she wanted them to be, or whether she should wear the ones with the sexy tears below the back pockets or go a bit more conservative.And that was just the bottoms; trying to decide on her top was even more difficult, especially since she hadnt decided whether to wear the bikini or a one piece underneath.Despite what shed said to Serena, it was a date, and aside from the fiasco last weekend with Jill and Paul, she hadnt been on a lot of dates recently.Add in the fact that her thoughts had been drifting to Colin all morning and last night, and the whole thing left her feeling more jittery than ever.What did she want with him, anyway?Colin was the kind of guy she used to prosecute.Until yesterday, had anyone even suggested that she go out with a guy with his past, she would have laughed aloud or  more likely  been offended.She should have simply said good bye after hed walked her to her car last night.The very idea of the two of them going out today was absurd, and yet she had asked him, and she had trouble remembering exactly how that had happened or what shed been thinking.And yet, Colin was magnetic.It was the word that had popped into her head while she was taking a shower, and the more shed thought about it, the more apt the description seemed.While his answers had left her spinning at times, she had to admit that his heres the real me and you can either accept me or not shtick was refreshing.More than that, she sensed that his regret had been real, underscoring how much he really had changed.She wasnt nave enough to ignore the possibility that he may have been trying to play on her sympathies, but it was impossible to reconcile that notion with the guy whod changed her tire, or walked the beach with her, or attended classes with her sister in the hopes of becoming a teacher.He certainly hadnt tried to hit on her, and had she not asked him to go paddleboarding, she had no doubt he would have left her at her car without further ado.She had to admit that she appreciated the fact that he had been so open and honest about his past.If hed waited until today to reveal those surprises, she would have felt manipulated and angry, maybe even frightened.The chemistry shed initially felt with him would have been doused almost instantly, leaving her wondering what else hed been lying about.No one likes a bait and switch.Truthfully, she didnt know a lot of people whod turned their lives in an entirely new direction, like Colin had.And though she had no idea where today might lead  or even whether it was a beginning of sorts  she finally thought, Oh, what the hell?and put on her black bikini, then chose the sexy tight jean shorts with the tears below the pockets.Last, she pulled on a formfitting shirt with a plunging neckline.Serena, after all, had been right about something else.If Colin took off his shirt  and that, she had to admit, wouldnt bother her in the slightest  then at the very least, she should have the option of doing the same.Colin was leaning against the side of his car as she pulled in behind him, and when he waved, all she could do was stare.He wore a gray T shirt that clung from his sculpted shoulders all the way down to his narrow waist.The sleeves could barely contain his well defined arms, and even from a distance, the deep blue gray color of his eyes was visible, set off by his sharp cheekbones.As improbable as it seemed, her first thought was that he was getting more handsome by the day.When he pushed away from the car and smiled, she felt something jump inside her while a little voice whispered, If Im not careful, I could get in serious trouble with this guy.Forcing the thought away, she waved from inside the car, then took a deep breath as she shut the engine down.When she opened the door, the heat assailed her almost immediately.Thankfully, the humidity was minimal and a slight breeze stirred the air, making it a bit more bearable.Hey there, she called out.Youre right on time.She saw that he had brought a backpack, a small cooler, and a pair of towels.He leaned over, picking up the backpack and flinging it over his shoulder.I got here early, he said.I wasnt sure that I was parking in the right place.There arent any other cars around.Its always quieter on the tip of the island, she said.People dont like to feed the meters, which is good, since it means we dont have so far to walk.She shaded her eyes.How did sparring go?It was a little more intense than usual, but no bruising or broken noses.I can tell, she said with a smile.How about the other guys?You didnt hurt them, did you?Theyre fine.He squinted into the glare.Your turn.How was brunch with your family?No broken noses or bruising, either, she teased, and when she heard him laugh, she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, reminding herself not to get too carried away.On a more serious note, though, I should probably warn you that I told Serena we were going out on the water today.In case she hunts you down after class and asks you for lots of personal details.Will she do that?For sure, Maria thought.Probably.Why doesnt she ask you?Im sure shell be calling me later.She considers it her duty to be heavily involved in my personal life.Okay.He grinned.You look beautiful, by the way.She felt a flash of heat in her cheeks.Thank you, she said.Then, trying to keep things light, she added, You ready for today?I cant wait.Were lucky there isnt a lot of wind.The water should be perfect.She began to unhook one of the straps that held the paddleboards in place on the roof rack.Noting what she was doing, he stepped close to help her unhook the other straps.The muscles in his forearms moved like piano strings, making his tattoo ripple as the two of them worked side by side.He smelled like salt and wind, clean and fresh.He lifted the top board off, leaning it against the car before doing the same with the other, propping the two against each other.Hows your balance on the board?he asked.Pretty good.Why?Because I packed a small cooler, he said, gesturing at it behind him.I was wondering if youd be able to put it on your board.Im not sure my balance will be good enough at first.Its not that hard, she said.Youll get the hang of it.But to answer your question, yes, I can put the cooler on my board, and actually, thats perfect, since it will give me a place to put the towels.I hate wet towels.Opening her door, she reached for both her camera and the carrier straps for the boards, consciously trying not to stare at him.She laid out the carrier straps, then hooked them to the boards, knowing Colin was watching her and liking the way it made her feel.When she was finished, he grabbed his backpack and both boards.Maria picked up the towels and cooler as they started toward the point.Whats in the cooler, by the way?she asked.Snacks, basically.Fruit, some nuts, a couple bottles of water.Healthy, she commented.Im pretty strict about what I eat.And the backpack?A Frisbee, a Hacky Sack, and sunscreen.If we hit the beach or whatever.Im not very good at Frisbee.And just so you know, Ive never touched a Hacky Sack in my life.Then well both be trying something new today.On the beach, the sand glowed almost white in the sunlight.Aside from a man tossing a ball to his golden retriever in the waves, the beach at this end of the island was deserted.Maria raised the cooler in the direction of the inlet.Thats Masonboro Island, she said.Until you mentioned it last night, Id never heard of it.Its rustic.There are no roads or picnic areas.In the summers, a lot of boaters go there, but lately, Ive had the place to myself.Its quiet and beautiful, and its a great way to kick off my week, especially one like this one.My partner has a trial later this week, and Ill probably be working late every night to make sure he has everything he needs.Ill head in earlier than usual, too.Thats a lot of hours.Gotta get ahead, you know, she cracked.Why?If I dont do my job, Ill get fired.I wasnt asking about doing your job well.I understand that.I was just wondering why its important to you to get ahead.Maria frowned, realizing that he was the first person whod ever asked her the question and she was at a loss.I dont know, she finally answered.I guess Im just wired that way.Either that, or it was all my parents fault.Isnt that what people say in therapy?Sometimes.And sometimes its even true.Dont you want to get ahead?Im not sure what getting ahead even means, he said.Bigger house?Better cars?More exotic vacations?My parents have all those things, but I dont get the sense that either of them is really happy.Theres always something more out there, but where does it end?I dont want to live like that.How do you want to live?I want balance.Work is important because I have to support myself, but so are friends, health, rest.Having the time to do things that I enjoy, and sometimes doing nothing at all.The cooler thumped gently against her leg.Thats very sensible.Okay.She smiled.I could have predicted he was going to say that.Youre right, of course.Balance is important, but Ive always liked the feeling of succeeding at something difficult, whether it was grades when I was a little girl or a well written brief now.Setting goals and then reaching them makes me feel like Im not just going through the motions of life.And in the end, if I do it well enough, other people notice, and I get rewarded.I like that, too.That makes sense.But not for you?Were different.Dont you set goals, too?Like finishing college or winning a fight?Yes.Then how are we different?Because I dont care about getting ahead.And I generally dont give a lot of thought to the way other people define it.And you think I do?Yes.Care to elaborate?He took a couple of steps before answering.I think you care deeply about the way you come across to other people, but to me, thats a mistake.In the end, the only one you can ever really please is yourself.How others feel is up to them.She pressed her lips together, knowing he was right but still a little taken aback that hed simply say it.Then again, he was forthright about everything else, so why should she be surprised?Did you learn that in therapy?Yes.But it took a long time to embrace it.Maybe I should talk to your therapist.Maybe, he agreed, and she laughed.Well, just so you know, its not all me.The fact that I need so much external validation is my parents fault.When he arched a skeptical eyebrow, she nudged his shoulder playfully, the gesture strangely natural.Im being serious about this.I might have been born with drive or ambition or whatever you want to call it, but they definitely nurtured it.Neither one of my parents went to school past the eighth grade, and they had to sacrifice for years before they could start the restaurant.They had to learn a new language and accounting and a thousand other things from scratch when they were adults, so to them, a good education was everything.I grew up speaking Spanish at home, so right from the start, I had to work harder than the other kids because I didnt understand anything the teacher was saying.Even though my parents were both working fifteen hour days, they never missed a meeting with my teachers, and they made sure I always did my homework.When I started to bring home good grades, they were just so proud.Theyd invite my aunts and uncles and cousins over on the weekend  Ive got a ton of relatives in town  and theyd pass around my report card, going on and on about what a good student I was.I was the center of attention and I liked the way it made me feel, so I began to work even harder.Id sit in the front row and raise my hand whenever the teacher asked a question, and Id stay up until the middle of the night studying for tests.As a result, I was pretty much a total nerd all the way through high school.Yeah?He wore that amused expression again.Uh yeah, she said sheepishly.I got glasses when I was eight, these brown rimmed monstrosities, and I had braces for three years.I was shy and gawky and I actually liked to study.I didnt go to a prom until I was a senior, and even then, I went with a group of other girls who didnt have dates, either.I never kissed a boy until the month before I started college.Trust me, I know what a nerd is, and I was one of them.And now?Im still kind of a nerd.I work too much, I dont visit my friends as often as I should, and I dont really do anything on the weekends except paddleboard and spend time with my family.On Friday nights, you can usually find me reading in bed.That doesnt make you a nerd.I dont go out much anymore, either.If Im not working out or competing, Im usually listening to some tunes or studying or hanging with Evan and Lily at the house.Lily?Evans fiance.Whats she like?Blond.About the same size as you.Terrific personality.And very, very Southern.Shes from Charleston.How about Evan?Is he anything like you?Hes more like you, actually.Hes got his act together.You think I have my act together?Yes.Then why doesnt it feel that way?I have no idea, he answered.But I think most people would say the same thing about you as I did.She squinted over at him, liking what hed said.By then, they had reached the shoreline, and she slipped off her sandals, focusing on the water.Okay, this is good, she declared.The tides going in, which makes it easier.If it were going out, wed have to launch from down there, she said, pointing over his shoulder.You ready?Almost, he said.He put the boards down and shrugged off the backpack, storing his flip flops and removing a bottle of sunscreen.He pulled off his shirt, tucking it away in the backpack as well, and her first thought was that he looked almost sculpted.His chest and stomach were a landscape of contours and ridges, every muscle sharply defined.On his chest, a colorful dragon tattoo wound its way over one shoulder, intertwining artfully with a Chinese character.He stared toward the water as he began to apply the lotion.Its gorgeous out here, he observed.I agree, she said, trying not to ogle.He squeezed some more sunscreen into his hand before offering her the bottle.Do you want some?Maybe later.I put some on earlier, but I dont generally burn.Latin skin, you know.He nodded, slathering some on the fronts of his legs and then turning around.Would you mind putting some on my back?She nodded, her mouth going slightly dry.Sure.Their fingers brushed as she took the lotion.She squeezed a dab into her hands and slowly ran her hands over his back, feeling the interplay of muscles and skin, trying to ignore the strange intimacy of what she was doing.Serena was going to love hearing about this.Will we see any dolphins or porpoises?he asked, seemingly oblivious to her thoughts.Running her hands over the cords in his back, it took her a moment to answer.I doubt it.At this time of day, theyre usually on the ocean side.Then, feeling a pang of disappointment, she finished and closed the cap.All right, youre done.Thanks, he said, putting the sunscreen away.Whats next?Were almost ready.She unhooked the carrier straps and handed them to Colin to store in his backpack as she grabbed the smaller of the two boards.Can you follow me out with the cooler and towels?Ill show you how to get up.She waded into the ocean with her board, and when she was a bit more than knee deep, she lay down on it, pulling herself along its length until she was centered.She set the oar perpendicular to the board, then held it fast as she first went to her knees, and then finally stood.Ta da And thats all there is to it.The key is to find your sweet spot, where neither the nose nor the tail is underwater.And then, keep your knees bent  itll help keep you upright.Got it.You can put the cooler behind me, and then stack the towels on.And would you hand me my camera?He waded into the water, following her instructions.She draped the camera strap around her neck as he retrieved his own board and repeated her movements.When he was standing, he shifted his weight, the board wobbling slightly.Its more stable than I thought it would be, he remarked.Now when you turn, you can either paddle forward for a wide, slow turn, or you can paddle backward for a tighter turn.She demonstrated the first, then the second, rotating in place, moving a bit farther from shore in the process.You ready?Lets go, he said.Within a few strokes hed caught up to her, and they began to paddle side by side until they reached the fertile, still waters of the marsh.Above them, the blue sky was limned with thin cirrus clouds.Discreetly, she watched Colin taking in everything, his gaze lingering on the brown pelicans and the snowy egrets, or an osprey that passed overhead.He didnt seem to feel the need to break the silence, and she thought again that shed never met anyone like him.As her thoughts continued to drift, she turned her attention to the island, noting the gnarled remnants of tree stumps, gray and salt coated, their roots twisting like frayed yarn on a loosely twined ball.Curving pathways cut through the saw grass speckled dunes, shortcuts to the ocean side of the island, and driftwood, stained black from the marsh, collected at the waters edge.Youre thinking about something, she heard him say.Without her noticing it, Colin had moved his board closer to hers.Just how much I love being out here.Do you come out every weekend?Most weekends, she said, keeping her strokes steady.Unless its raining or the wind is gusting.Strong winds make it feel like youre not getting anywhere, and the water can get kind of choppy.I made that mistake once when I brought Serena out here.She lasted about twenty minutes before she insisted on heading back, and she hasnt come out ever since.When it comes to the ocean, shes more of the lay out in the sun or relax in the back of the boat type of girl.Even though were close, were not that much alike.The curiosity in the way he watched and listened urged her on, and Maria drew her paddle through the water.Serena has always been more outgoing and popular than I ever was.Shes had one boyfriend after the next and has a zillion friends.Her phone never stops ringing, people always want to spend time with her.It wasnt like that for me.I was always quieter, shyer I guess, and I grew up feeling like I never really fit in.You dont seem shy to me.No?she asked.How do I seem to you?He cocked his head.Thoughtful.Intelligent.Empathetic.Beautiful.The certainty with which he spoke  like hed reviewed the list beforehand  made her feel suddenly self conscious.Thank you, she murmured.That was sweet.Im sure youve heard it before.Not really.Then youre hanging out with the wrong people.She adjusted her feet on the board, trying to mask how flattered and flustered she felt.So no girlfriend for you?No, he answered.I wasnt really boyfriend material for a while there, and lately Ive been pretty busy.You?Still single, she said.I had a serious boyfriend when I was in college, but it didnt work out.And lately Ive had a tendency to attract the wrong kind of men.Like me?She gave a sheepish grin.I wasnt thinking of you when I said that.I was thinking about the managing partner at my firm.Who happens to be married and has a family.Hes been hitting on me and its been making work pretty stressful.I can imagine.But you dont have any advice for me, right?Since you dont give advice?No.You do realize that having a conversation with you takes some getting used to, right?Serena, for instance, always has loads of advice.Is it helpful?Not really.His expression said shed just proved his point.What happened with your boyfriend?Theres not much to say.Wed been going out for a couple of years and it felt to me like we were moving toward something more serious.Marriage?She nodded.I thought so.But then, he decided that I wasnt what he wanted.He wanted someone else.That had to be rough.At the time, it was devastating, she agreed.And no boyfriends since then?Not really.Ive dated a few guys, but nothing ever really materialized.She paused, remembering.Id go dancing with my girlfriends at this salsa club in Charlotte, but most of the guys I ended up meeting wanted only one thing.To me, sleeping with someone is an outgrowth of a commitment, and a lot of guys just want a fling or whatever.Thats their problem.I know.But She tried to think of the best way to phrase it.Its hard sometimes.Maybe its because my parents are so happy and make it seem so easy, but Ive always assumed that Id be able to find the perfect guy without having to settle.And growing up, I had all these plans I just knew that by now, at my age, Id be married and wed live in a restored Victorian and wed be talking about kids.But those things seem further away now than they did when I was a little girl.They seem further away than they did even a couple of years ago.When he didnt respond, she shook her head.I cant believe Im telling you all this.Im interested.Sure you are, she said, dismissing his comment.It sounds boring, even to me.Its not boring, he countered.Its your story and I like hearing it.He let that sit before abruptly changing the subject.Salsa dancing, huh?Thats what you heard?In everything I said?When he shrugged, she went on, wondering why it seemed so easy to talk to him.I used to go almost every weekend.But you dont go anymore?Not since Ive moved back.They dont have any clubs here.Not officially, anyway.Serena tried to drag me to this one place and I thought about it, but I begged off at the last minute.It sounds like it might have been fun.Maybe.But its not even a real club.Its in this abandoned warehouse, and Im pretty sure the whole setup is illegal.Sometimes those are the best places to go.I assume youre speaking from experience?Yes.She smiled.Do you know anything about salsa dancing?Is it like the tango?Not really.The tango is kind of like ballroom dancing, where you move around the room.Salsa dancing is more of a party dance with lots of spinning and changing hands, and you stay in one place on the floor.Its a great way to spend a couple of hours with friends, especially if your partner is good.It was the only time I felt like I could really let go and be myself.Arent you being yourself right now?Of course, she answered.But this is definitely the quieter version of me, the more typical one.She raised the oar overhead to stretch for a moment, then dipped the tip into the water again.I have a question, she said.And Ive been wondering about it since you mentioned it.When he turned toward her, she went on.Why do you want to teach the third grade?Id think that most guys would want to teach at the high school level.He pulled his oar through the water.Because at that age, kids are old enough to understand most everything an adult tells them, but still young enough to believe that adults tell the truth.Its also the year when behavior problems begin to really manifest.Taken together with all the testing the state requires, third grade is just a critical year.They glided on water almost as still as glass.And?she asked.And what?You said the same thing to me last night.When you thought I wasnt telling you the whole story.So Ill ask you again  whats the real reason you want to teach the third grade?Because it was my last good year in school, he said.Until a couple of years ago, in fact, it was my last good year, period.And it was all because of Mr.Morris.He was a retired army officer who got into teaching later in life, and he knew exactly what I needed.Not the mindless discipline I had later in military school, but a specific plan just for me.He didnt take any crap in class from the very beginning, and as soon as I began acting up, he told me that Id have to stay after school.I thought Id just sit in the classroom with a book or hed have me clean up or whatever, but instead he had me run laps around the lower school and do push ups every time I passed him.And the whole time, he kept telling me that I was doing great, that I was really fast or strong or whatever, so it didnt feel like punishment.He did the same thing at recess the next day, and then he asked if I could start showing up early every day because it was clear that I had a gift for running.That I was stronger than the other kids.Better than the other kids.Looking back, I know he was doing it because of my ADHD and other emotional crap, and that all he really wanted to do was burn off my excess energy so that I could sit still in class.His voice grew softer as he went on.But back then, it was the first time I could ever remember being praised, and after that, all I wanted to do was make him even more proud of me.I buckled down and school started to get easier for me.I caught up in reading and math, and I was better behaved at home, too.Fast forward a year to Mrs.Crandalls class, and all that went right out the window.She was mean and angry and she hated boys, and I went back to being the troubled kid I used to be.After that, my parents shipped me off, and you already know the rest of that story.He let out a long breath before facing her.Thats why I want to teach the third grade.Because maybe, just maybe, Ill come across a kid like me and Ill know exactly what to do.And in the long run, I know how much that single year might mean to that kid.Because without Mr.Morris so long ago, I would never have considered going back to college now and becoming a teacher.While Colin spoke, Maria kept her gaze fixed on him.I know I shouldnt be surprised, considering everything else youve told me, she said.But I am.Because?Its inspiring.Why you want to become a teacher, I mean.I dont have any stories like that.Half the time, Im not even sure why I became a lawyer in the first place.It just kind of happened.How so?When I first got to college, I wasnt sure what I wanted to do.I thought about business school or getting a masters and I even debated whether or not to go to medical school.It was hard enough just to pick a major, and even in my junior year, I still had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.My roommate, on the other hand, was set on going to law school, and I sort of convinced myself that the idea was a lot more glamorous than it really is.The next thing I knew, I was applying to law school, and three years later, I had a job lined up with the DA and was studying for the bar.And now, here I am.Dont get me wrong  Im good at what I do, but sometimes its hard for me to imagine that Ill be doing it the rest of my life.Who says you have to?I cant just throw my education away.Or the past four years.What would I do?He scratched at his jaw.I think, he finally said, you can do whatever you want.In the end, we all live the life we choose for ourselves.What do your parents think about you being back in school?I think theyre still wondering whether Ive really changed, or whether Ill revert to being the guy I used to be.She smiled, liking that he said what he thought without worrying what she might think.I dont know why, but its hard for me to imagine the other Colin, the one you used to be.You wouldnt have liked him much.Probably not, she said.And he probably wouldnt have stopped to change my tire, either.Definitely not, he agreed.What else should I know about the new Colin?she asked, and her question gradually gave way to a meandering conversation about growing up in Raleigh and a bit more about his friendship with Evan and Lily.He told her about his parents and his older sisters, and what it had been like to grow up under the care of various nannies.He talked about the early fights hed been in, the schools hed attended, and offered more details about the years following high school, although he admitted that theyd largely blurred together.He talked about MMA, and when pressed, he recounted a few of his fights, including the most recent one with the marine, which had left him bruised and bloody.While many of the stories he told her underscored the rough edges of his past, they were of a piece with what she already knew.As they talked, the tide began to roll in, propelling them forward side by side.The sun gradually bowed toward the horizon, the water beginning to gleam like old pennies.The thin cloud cover softened the glare and began to change colors  pinks and oranges and magentas.Would you like to check out the beach?she finally asked.He nodded, and as they began paddling toward shore, Maria spotted the sleek, dark backs of three porpoises slowly approaching.They arced through the water, and when she pointed them out, Colin broke into a boyish grin.In unspoken agreement, they stopped paddling, allowing their boards to drift.To her surprise, the porpoises altered their course, gliding directly toward them.On instinct, Maria reached for the camera and began to snap photos, adjusting the framing with every shot.By some miracle, she captured an image of all three of the porpoises breaching the surface before they paraded past in single file, close enough to touch, their blowholes spraying water.Maria turned, watching them retreat toward the inlet and the ocean beyond, wondering what had brought them to this place in this exact moment.When they finally vanished from sight, she noticed that Colin had been staring at her.He smiled, and on instinct, she raised the camera and snapped his picture, suddenly recalling the flash of vulnerability hed shown a few minutes earlier.Despite the outward confidence he exuded, she understood that like her, Colin simply wanted to be accepted; in his own way, he was just as lonely as she was.The realization made her ache, and it suddenly felt like they were the only two people in the world.In this silent, intimate moment, she knew that she wanted to spend more afternoons with him just like this one, an ordinary afternoon that somehow felt magical.CHAPTER 7      Colin      O  n the beach, Colin sat on a towel with Maria beside him, trying to ignore the way she looked in the black bikini that had been hidden beneath her clothing.Yesterday hed viewed her as an intriguing stranger; while paddleboarding today, hed come to view her as a friend; but now, he wasnt sure what might come next.All he really knew was that the black bikini was making it difficult to keep his thoughts straight.Maria, he decided, was beyond pretty, planted firmly in the stunning range, and although Colin sensed that something had changed between them over the course of the day, he couldnt quite put a name to it.He didnt have much experience with women like Maria.Instead of college degrees and close knit families, the women hed dated tended to have numerous piercings and tattoos, angry faades and serious daddy issues.They expected to be treated poorly, and hed generally obliged.The mutual lack of expectation made for something resembling comfort when they hung out together.Damaged comfort for sure, but misery loves company.Only a couple of them had lasted as long as three months, but unlike Evan, having one special person in his life had never held much interest for Colin.He wasnt wired that way.He liked the freedom that came with being single, without having to answer to someone else.It was hard enough to keep his own life straight, let alone trying to meet someone elses expectations.Or at least that was what hed always believed, but now, as he surreptitiously admired Maria, he wondered whether hed simply been making excuses.Whether maybe, just maybe, he hadnt cared about being in a relationship because hed never given it an honest shot, or because he hadnt met the right person.He knew he was getting ahead of himself, but he couldnt deny the fact that he wanted to spend more time with her.Why she was still single was beyond him.He reminded himself that there wasnt a chance shed be interested in a guy like him.And yet  In the hospital, hed spent a lot of time in group therapy, where trying to figure out what made others tick was part and parcel of the exercise itself.Understanding others meant understanding yourself  and vice versa  and hed long ago become attuned to body language and vocal cues people displayed as they shared their fears and flaws and regrets.And while he couldnt precisely read Maria, he suspected she was just as confused about what was happening as he was.Which made sense.Although he was doing okay now, she had to realize that the old Colin would always be part of him.That would be a concern for anyone; hell, he was concerned about it, too.While his explosive anger was dormant at the present time, it was like a hibernating bear, and he knew he had to structure his life a certain way to keep spring from arriving so the bear would stay asleep.Train hard to keep his anger in check; indulge in the occasional MMA match to purge his aggression.Study hard and work long hours to fill his schedule and keep him from visiting the wrong places.Stay away from drugs and limit alcohol.Spend time with Evan and Lily, who not only were model citizens, but were always there to lend support and keep him out of harms way.There wasnt room in his life for Maria.There wasnt time.He didnt have the energy.And yet  They were alone together on an isolated stretch of sand, and he thought again that she was sexy as hell.Logically, Maria should have run for the hills by now, but she seemed to be taking his past in stride, and for the life of him, he couldnt stop thinking about her.He watched as she leaned back in the glow of the late afternoon sun, propping herself on her elbows.He thought again that she was as naturally beautiful as anyone hed ever seen, and in an effort to distract himself, he rolled to the side and reached behind her, pulling the cooler toward him.He popped off the lid and retrieved two bottles of water, then handed one of them to her.Banana or orange?he asked.Banana, she said.She sat up, languid and graceful.Oranges get my hands all sticky.He handed it over and pulled out a couple of baggies of mixed nuts.Do you want some of these, too?Sure, she said.Why not?She took the baggie and popped a couple of almonds into her mouth.This is just what I needed, she said with a wink.I can already feel my cholesterol dropping and my muscles getting bigger.He smiled, beginning to peel his orange.She did the same with her banana and took a bite before leaning back again.I never do this, she said.Come to the beach when Im here, I mean.Ive paddled past it, but Ive never actually come out here just to relax.Why not?In the summer, there are always too many people around.Id feel weird coming out here alone.Why?It wouldnt bother me.I have no doubt youd do it.For you, its no big deal.But its different for women.Coming out here, all alone  some guys might think its an invitation.And what if some crazy man sat next to me and started hitting on me?Like someone whod done drugs and was on probation and had a history of going to bars so he could fight strangers and stomp on peoples heads Oh, wait!She feigned horror as she suddenly turned toward him.He laughed.What if he said hed changed?At first, I probably wouldnt believe him.What if he was charming?Hed have to be really, really charming, but even then, Id probably rather be alone.Even if he changed your tire in the middle of a storm?Id definitely be grateful for the way he helped me out, but I dont know if it would make much difference.Even crazy people can do something nice once in a while.Thats probably a wise decision.A guy like that might be dangerous and definitely not someone youd want to be alone with.Obviously, she said.Of course, theres always the possibility that he really had changed and that he happened to be a nice guy, which means Id be out of luck.Since I never even gave him a chance, I mean.I can understand how that might be a problem.Anyway, thats why I dont come out to the beach alone.It just eliminates the whole issue.Makes sense.Still, I have to admit that Im not quite sure how I feel about what you just said.Good, she answered, nudging him playfully with her shoulder.Then were even.I havent known how to feel about a lot of what youve told me.Though he wasnt sure if she was flirting, he liked how natural it felt when she touched him.How about we change the subject to safer ground?Like what?Tell me about your family.You said you have a lot of relatives in town?My grandparents on both sides still live in Mexico, but three aunts and four uncles live in Wilmington, along with over twenty cousins.And we throw some rocking family parties.Sounds fun.It is.A lot of them either work or used to work at La Cocina de la Familia, so the restaurant was like our second home.Growing up, I probably spent more time there than at the house.Yeah?She nodded.When I was little, my parents had this play area set up in the back so my mom could watch me, and when I started school, Id do my homework in the office.After Serena was born, Id watch Serena in the play area until my moms shift ended, and then when Serena was older, I started working there, too.But the strange thing is, I never remember feeling like I came in second to the restaurant, or even like it dominated my life.Not only because my whole family was there, but because my parents were always popping in to check on me and make sure I was okay.And when we were at home, it didnt feel much different.We always had relatives over.A lot of them lived with us until they saved enough money to get their own place.For a kid, theres nothing better.There was always something going on; people talking or playing or cooking or listening to music.It was always loud, but it was good energy.Happy energy.He tried to match her account with the woman sitting beside him, finding it surprisingly easy.How old were you when you started working at the restaurant?Fourteen, she said.I worked there after school and every summer and Christmas break until I graduated from law school.My parents thought it would be good for me to earn my own spending money.You sound proud of them.Wouldnt you be?Though I must admit that Im not quite sure what my parents would think if they knew I was with you today.I have a pretty good idea of what they might think.She laughed, lighthearted and unrestrained.You want to try tossing the Frisbee around?Ill try.Dont say I didnt warn you.She hadnt been lying.She wasnt very good; nearly all of her tosses veered off course, some hitting the sand and others getting caught in the breeze.Colin zigzagged gamely, trying to rescue the Frisbee before it hit the ground while hearing her call out, Im sorry!Whenever she succeeded in making an accurate throw or catching the Frisbee, she reveled with almost childlike glee.Through it all, she kept up a steady chatter.She told him about her trips to Mexico to visit her grandparents and described the tiny cinder block houses where both sets had lived their entire lives.She touched on her high school years, along with a few of her college and law school experiences, and shared a few stories about working at the DAs office.He was perplexed at how her first boyfriend could have let her go and why no one else had come along since.Could anyone be so blind?He didnt know and didnt care: All he really knew for sure was that he was unbelievably lucky that shed wandered out to the pier.Abandoning the Frisbee, hed grabbed the Hacky Sack and heard her laugh aloud.Not a chance, she said before collapsing on her towel.Colin sat beside her, feeling the weariness of an active day in the sun and noticing that Marias skin had taken on a buttery glow.They finished the rest of their water, sipping slowly as they watched the waves.I think Id like to watch you fight, she said, turning toward him.Okay, he said.Whens the next one?Not for a few weeks.Its at the House of Blues in North Myrtle Beach.Who are you fighting?I dont know yet.How can you not know who youre fighting?He ran his fingers through the sand.In amateur events, the ticket isnt always finished until the day before.It all depends on who wants to fight, whos ready to fight, whos available to fight.And, of course, who actually signs up to fight.Does that make you nervous?Not knowing?Not really.What if hes like a giant or something?There are weight classes, so thats not a concern.My main worry is if the guy panics and breaks the rules.Some of the guys who show up in these amateur events dont have a lot of experience in the cage, and its easy to lose control.Thats what happened when my last opponent head butted me.They had to stop the fight so I could get the bleeding under control, but the ref didnt catch it.My coach was going nuts.And you actually enjoy that?It comes with the territory, he said.The good news is that I got the guy in a guillotine choke hold in the next round and he had to tap out.And I did enjoy that part.You do realize thats not normal, right?Okay.And just so were clear, I dont care whether you win or lose, but I dont want you to get all bloodied and bruised.Ill do my best.She furrowed her brow.Wait  the House of Blues?Isnt that a restaurant?Among other things.But it has enough room.Amateur events dont usually draw much of a crowd.Im shocked!Who wouldnt want to watch men trying to beat the hell out of each other?What is wrong with society these days?He grinned.She wrapped her arms around her knees as shed done the night before, but this time, he could feel her shoulder brushing against his own.How did the photos turn out?he asked.The ones of the porpoises?Maria reached for her camera and clicked to the display before handing it to him.I think this ones the best, she said.But there are a few more.Just use the arrow button there to go through them.He stared at the image of the three porpoises.Its incredible, he said.Its almost like they were posing.Sometimes I get lucky.The light was just right.She leaned toward him, her arm grazing his.There are others that Ive taken in the last month that I liked, too.He used the back arrow, scanning a long series of photos: pelicans and ospreys, a close up of a butterfly, a mullet caught in midjump.When she leaned further into him to follow along, he caught the scent of wildflowers in the heat.At the end of the series, she finally pulled back.You should frame some of these, he said, handing her the camera.I do, she said.But just the better ones.Better than these?Youd be the one to judge, she said.Of course, youd have to come over first, since theyre hanging on my walls.Id think Id like that, Maria.Maria turned toward the water again, a slight smile playing on her lips, and it seemed odd to think that it was only yesterday that hed spotted her at the end of the pier.Or how well hed come to know her in such a short period of time.And how much he wanted to know even more about her.We should probably get going, she said, a note of regret in her voice.Before it starts getting too dark.He nodded, feeling a stab of disappointment as they rose to gather up their things.They paddled back, reaching Wrightsville Beach just as the first stars were emerging.Colin helped Maria strap the boards and paddles to the top of her car before turning to face her.Watching her brush the hair from her eyes, he felt oddly nervous, something he could never remember happening with a woman before.I had a great time today.Paddleboarding is a lot of fun, she agreed.I wasnt talking about the paddleboarding, he said.He shifted from one foot to the other, and he had the impression that she was waiting for him to finish.I was talking about spending time with you.Yeah?she asked, her voice soft.Yeah.Colin was sure she was more beautiful than any woman hed ever known.What are you doing next weekend?Other than brunch on Sunday, I dont have anything planned.Do you want to go to that warehouse Serena told you about?On Saturday night?Are you asking me to go dancing?Id like to get to know the less typical Maria, the one who can really be herself.Because the quieter version isnt your type?No, he said.Actually, its just the opposite.And I already know how I feel about that Maria.Crickets were calling from the dunes, serenading them like natures orchestra.They were alone, and as she stared up at him, he stepped toward her, instinct taking over.He wondered if shed turn away and break the spell, but she didnt.Instead, she stayed in place as he moved even nearer, one arm slowly going around her back.He pulled her close, their lips coming together, and at that moment, he suddenly knew that this was what hed wanted all along.Hed wanted her, in his arms, just like this, forever.Colin took his time getting home, driving through Wilmingtons prettier back streets and basking in the warm afterglow of his day with Maria.His body felt surprisingly well used by the afternoon of paddleboarding, his mind still circling the mystery of Maria.Getting out of his car, he was just ambling across the newly cut lawn toward his apartment when he heard Lily calling from the porch, her cell phone in hand.There you are, she said, her drawl almost a singsong.As always, she was perfectly coiffed.Tonight, though, in something of a rarity, she was wearing jeans  albeit with pumps, a pearl necklace, tastefully sized diamond studs, and a gardenia artfully pinned in her hair.What are you doing out here?he asked, veering toward her.I was speaking to my mother while I was waiting for you, she answered, skipping down the steps toward him.Lily was the only girl he knew who actually skipped when she was happy.She leaned in for a hug.Evan told me you were going on a date today and I want to hear all about it before we go inside.Wheres Evan?Hes on the computer researching some pharmaceutical company for his clients.You know how serious he is about his work, bless his heart.But dont try to change the subject.For now, were going to sit on the steps while you tell me about this special young woman, and I wont take no for an answer.And dont leave anything out.I want to hear everything.She took a seat on the steps, patting the spot beside her.Colin knew he had no choice but to do as hed been told, and he gave her the basics.Lily interrupted frequently, pressing him for details.When he finished, she squinted at him, obviously disappointed.You really must work on your storytelling skills, Colin, she chided.All you did was recite a list of activities and the topics you talked about.How else was I supposed to tell it?Thats a silly question.You were supposed to make me fall in love with her, too.Why would I want to do that?Because even as poorly as you told the story, its obvious that youre smitten with her.He said nothing.Colin?she said.This is exactly what I mean.What you should have said was something like, When Im with Maria I just I and then trail off and shake your head because words are inadequate to convey the intensity of what youre experiencing.That sounds more like you than me.I know, she said, sounding almost sorry for him.Thats what makes you such a poor storyteller, bless your heart.Only Lily could insult him in a way that made it sound as though it was harder for her to say than for him to hear.How do you know Im smitten with her?he asked.She sighed.If you didnt enjoy spending the day in her presence, you would have given me that blank look of yours and said, Theres nothing to talk about, when I asked you about her.And all that, of course, brings the primary question to mind: When will I have the chance to meet her?Id have to ask her.And do you have immediate plans to spend more time with your lady friend?Colin hesitated, wondering if anyone besides Lily still used the term lady friend.Were supposed to go out next weekend.Not to a bar, I hope.No, he said.He told her about the warehouse.Do you think thats a wise decision?Considering what happened the last time you went to a club with Evan and me?I just want to take her dancing.Dancing can be very romantic, she admitted.And yet  Itll be fine.I promise.Then I shall take you at your word.Of course, you should also swing by her office sometime this week and surprise her with flowers or candy.Women love to receive those sorts of thoughtful gifts, though Ive always held the opinion that candy is better during the cool months.So maybe just flowers.Thats not my style.Of course it isnt, which is why I made the suggestion.Trust me.Shell be thrilled.Okay.At his answer, she reached over and patted his hand.Havent we talked about this?Saying okay when people talk to you?Its a habit you really need to break.Its very unattractive.Okay.And so it goes.She sighed.One day, youll understand the wisdom of my words.Behind them, Evan opened the door, catching sight of her hand on Colins, but Evan understood the relationship between the three of them the same way Colin did.Let me guess.Youre grilling him about his date?he asked his fiance.I was doing no such thing, Lily huffed.Ladies do not grill.I simply inquired how he believed their date went, and though Colin  poor thing  nearly put me to sleep at first, I do think our friend here is smitten.Evan laughed.Colin?Smitten?Those two things just dont go together.Colin, would you please inform my fianc as to the truth of this matter?Colin hooked a thumb toward her.She thinks Im smitten.As I said, Lily noted, sounding satisfied.Now that weve gotten to the truth of the matter, she went on, when do you plan on calling your new lady friend?I havent thought about it.Have you learned nothing from me?She shook her head.Before you even shower, you must  you absolutely must  give your lady friend a call.And you must also tell her how wonderful she made you feel, and that you were honored by the pleasure of her company.Dont you think thats a little much?Lily sounded almost sad.Colin I know you struggle when it comes to expressing your sensitive side, and that is a flaw in your character that Ive always been willing to overlook, if only out of dear friendship.But you will call her this evening.As soon as you walk in the door.Because gentlemen  real gentlemen  always call, and I only associate with gentlemen.Evan raised his eyebrows and Colin knew he had no choice.Okay.CHAPTER 8      Maria      O  n Monday, Maria thought it best to hide out in her office, where she could concentrate in peace.Barneys stress level about the upcoming trial was escalating, and she didnt want to become an unwitting target.Closing her door, she jotted notes in preparation for a midmorning meeting with clients, made some phone calls, and responded to e mails, wanting to get a jump on the week.And yet, despite her desire for efficiency, every now and then shed catch herself staring out the window, replaying images from the weekend.Some of her distraction had to do with Colins phone call on Sunday night.If friends and magazines spoke the truth, guys didnt call right away, and most of them never called at all.Then again, everything about Colin verged on the unexpected.After hanging up, shed examined the photo that shed taken of him and imagined that she saw in it both the Colin she knew and Colin the stranger.His expression was gentle, but his body was a map of scars and tattoos.Though shed promised to show Serena, she decided then and there that the photo would be for her eyes only.Someones in a good mood.At the sound, Maria saw Jill in the doorway.Oh, hey, Jill.Whats up?I suppose I should be asking you, she said, entering.You were definitely lost in your own dreamy little world when I peeked in, and no one does that on Mondays.I had a good weekend.Yeah?she asked.By the way you just said it, Im assuming that it went way better than my depositions last week.This has to be the first time I ever found myself actually praying I could return to the office.That bad?Awful.You want to talk about it?Only if you want to die of boredom.And anyway, I have a conference call in a few minutes.I mainly dropped by to see if youre doing anything for lunch.Im dying for some sushi and good company now that Im back in the saddle.Sounds great.Jill adjusted the sleeve of her blouse.I may be reading this wrong, but I take it that youre not still mad at me.Why would I be mad at you?Maybe because I ambushed you with the worst blind date in history?Oh, yeah, Maria said, surprised that shed nearly forgotten.That.Im so sorry, Jill said.You cant imagine how bad I felt all week, especially since I didnt have the chance to talk to you about it.We talked, remember?And you apologized.Not enough.Its okay.And actually, it ended up turning out fine.I cant imagine how.I met someone.A couple of beats passed before the answer came to her.Youre not talking about the guy who changed your tire?The one who was bruised and bleeding and scared you half to death?Thats the one.Hows that even possible?Its kind of hard to explain.Jill smirked.Uh oh.What?Youre smiling again.Am I?Yes, you are.And part of me wants to cancel the conference call and just pull up a chair.I cant.Barney and I are meeting a client in a few minutes.But were definitely on for lunch, right?And youll fill me in then?Without a doubt.Ten minutes later, Serena called on her cell phone.When Maria saw who was on the line, she felt a sudden jolt of concern.Serena never called before ten a. m.  Half the time, she wasnt even awake by ten.Serena?Are you okay?Where is it?Wheres what?The photo of Colin.It wasnt in my e mail or text.Maria blinked.Youre calling me at work, during work hours, about a photo?I wouldnt have had to if youd already sent it.Did it go okay?Tell me you didnt already run him off.No.As a matter of fact, were going out Saturday night.Okay, Serena said.The post wont have as much impact without a photo, though.Of course, I guess I could just use one of you from when you were a kid or whatever if youre not going to send it  Good bye, Serena.She hung up the phone, only to reach for her cell phone a few minutes later, more out of morbid curiosity than anything.And there, on Instagram, was her photo.From when she was in middle school.Braces.Acne.Glasses.Gawky.The worst school photo in the history of school photos.Try not to be jealous, guys, but my sister Maria has a date this Saturday night!Maria closed her eyes.She was going to have to kill her sister.No question about it.But she had to admit, Serena was kind of funny.Over a plate of assorted sushi and sashimi a couple of hours later, Maria filled Jill in on much of what had happened with Colin, the story sounding unbelievable even to her.Wow, Jill breathed.Do you think Im crazy?Considering his past?Who am I to judge?Look at the blind date we set up.On something as out of the box as this, your best bet is to just keep following your instincts.What if my instincts are wrong?Then at the very least, you got your tire changed.And had a nice date, which Im hoping will get me totally off the hook for that double date fiasco.Maria smiled.So the depositions were boring?They were enough to make a monk go crazy, since half the people are perfectly willing to lie under oath and the other half say they cant remember anything at all.And now that I wasted my time all week, well probably just end up settling.Par for the course, but I cant say Im ever going to enjoy it.She snagged another piece of sushi.How goes it with Barney?Better, she said.What does that mean?Oh, thats right  you werent here, Maria started, and she told Jill about getting her tire changed and how it led to being late for the meeting, along with all the work she felt compelled to do in the aftermath.She also recounted the dressing down Barney gave her, though she omitted the confrontation with Ken.Barney will get over it.Hes always tense before trial.Yes, but Maria shifted in her seat.The thing is, I heard that Barney was going to let me be lead counsel on this case.Where did you hear that?Jill held her chopsticks at half mast.Dont get me wrong, youre a brilliant associate  but youre a little short on experience for Barney to saddle you with that kind of responsibility.Rumors, Maria said.I wouldnt put much stock in rumors.Barney enjoys the limelight too much, and he has a hard time ceding control  not to mention credit  to even the most senior associates.Thats one of the reasons I transferred to labor and employment.I figured Id never be able to move up, or even get the courtroom experience I needed.I still cant believe you were able to transfer departments.Lucky timing.I told you I was in labor and employment for a few years before I started at the firm, right?When Maria nodded, Jill went on.At the time, though, I wasnt sure it was what I really wanted to do, so I took a chance and tried insurance litigation.I worked with Barney for nine months and practically killed myself before I realized it was a dead end.I would have left, but it just so happened that the firm was building up its labor and employment practice and needed me.Unfortunately, Im kind of stuck if this doesnt work out.Unless we start doing criminal defense.You could always change firms.Thats not as easy as you might think.You havent been looking, have you?Not really.But Ive been beginning to wonder if I should start.Jill scrutinized her as she reached for her glass.You know you can talk to me, right?About any concerns you have.While Im not a partner, I do run my own department, which gives me some clout around here.Ive just got a lot on my mind right now.Hopefully, youre talking about Colin.The mention of his name brought more memories from the weekend, and she changed the subject.Hows Paul doing?Hes fine.I had to give him the cold shoulder for a couple of days as punishment for the date, but he got over it.We went to Asheville over the weekend for some wine tasting.That sounds fun.It was.Except, of course, theres no ring yet and the biological clock is still ticking and time is growing short.Pretending that everything is okay hasnt worked yet, so maybe its time to try a new strategy.Like what?I have no idea.If you have any foolproof plans, be sure to let me know.Will do.Jill had another piece of sushi.What do you have lined up this afternoon?Same stuff as usual.Theres a lot of prep work to finish for the trial.While trying to keep up with everything else, of course.Like I said, Barney expects a lot from his associates.And Ken expects something else.Its a job, she said.Are you sure everything is okay?Even with our lecherous managing partner?Why would you ask?Because you went off to that conference with him, and Ive known him longer than you have.And remember  I know exactly how he operates.The conference was fine.Jill gave her the once over before finally offering a shrug.Fair enough, she said.The point is, Im sensing that something else is bothering you.Maria cleared her throat, wondering why it suddenly felt as if she were being interrogated.Theres really nothing to say, she answered.Im just doing the best job I can.The days that followed were too busy for the luxury of daydreaming, with Barney storming into her office every half hour asking her to examine additional details or to make calls, notwithstanding her work on other client matters.She barely had time to leave her desk, and on Wednesday afternoon, while working on a draft of Barneys opening statement, she failed to notice the way the sunlight began slanting through her windows, or the departures, one by one, of her colleagues.She stared at her MacBook screen with singular concentration until a knock at her office door startled her.She saw the door slowly swing open.Ken.With a jolt of panic, she looked through the open doorway; across the hall, Lynn was no longer at her desk.Barneys office was dark, and she couldnt hear anyone else in the hallway.I noticed that your lights were still on, he said, stepping into her office.Do you have a few minutes?
