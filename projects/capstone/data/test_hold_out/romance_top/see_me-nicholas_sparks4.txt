I was just finishing up, she improvised, hearing a trace of uncertainty in her tone.I must have lost track of time.Im glad I caught you then, he said, his voice smooth and controlled.I wanted to finish the conversation we started last week.Maria felt a thud in her chest and began collecting the pages on her desk before slipping them back into their folders.The last thing she wanted was to be alone with him.She swallowed.Is there any way we could do this tomorrow?Im already late and Im supposed to have dinner with my parents tonight.It wont take long, he said, ignoring her excuse as he came around her desk.He stood near the window and she noted the sky had darkened beyond the glass.It might be easier for you this way, since were away from prying eyes.Theres no reason for everyone to know what happened with Barneys clients.Not knowing what to say, she stayed quiet.He glanced out the window, seemingly focused on something in the distance.How do you like working with Barney?he finally asked.Im learning a lot from him, Maria began, choosing her words carefully.He has great strategic instincts, the clients trust him, and as a colleague, hes good at explaining his thinking.You respect him, then.Of course.Its important to work with people that you respect.Its important that the two of you can work together as a team.Ken adjusted the venetian blinds, closing them slightly, then returning them to their original position.Would you consider yourself a team player?The question hung in the air before she was able to answer.I try to be, she said.Ken waited a beat before going on.I spoke to Barney again on Friday about the situation, and I must say that I was a bit surprised at how angry he still was over what happened.Thats why I asked you about being a team player.Because I went to bat for you in that meeting, and I think Ive been able to defuse the situation.I wanted to make sure I was doing the right thing.Maria swallowed, wondering why Barney hadnt talked to her himself if he was still so upset.Thank you, she finally murmured.He turned from the window and took a step toward her.I did it because I want you to have a long and successful tenure at the firm.Youre going to need someone whos able to advocate for you in these kinds of situations, and Im here to help you when I can.By then, he was standing over her, and she felt him place a hand on her shoulder.Kind of.His fingertips skimmed the area below her collarbone.You should consider me a friend, albeit a friend in a high place.Recoiling from his touch, she suddenly knew that all of this  the Monday cold shoulder, the dressing down on Thursday, and now this you and me against the world show  was simply part of his latest plan to get her in bed, and she wondered why she hadnt been able to see it coming.We should go to lunch tomorrow, he said, his fingertips still brushing the exposed skin above her scoop necked shirt.We can talk about other ways that I can help you navigate the ins and outs of the office, especially if you hope to become a partner one day.I think you and I will be able to work together really well.Dont you think so, Maria?It was the sound of her name that brought her back, his words finally registering.Not in this lifetime, she suddenly thought.I cant go to lunch tomorrow, she said, trying to hold her voice steady.I already have plans.A flash of annoyance crossed his face.With Jill?That was usually the case, and Ken of course knew that.No doubt hed suggest that she change the plan.For her own good.Actually, Im going to lunch with my boyfriend.She felt his hand slowly slip off her shoulder.You have a boyfriend?I told you about Colin, didnt I?When we were at the conference?No, he answered.You didnt mention him.Sensing her chance, Maria rose from her seat and stepped away, continuing to collect documents, stuffing them into files, not caring where they ended up.She could sort them out later.Thats strange, she remarked.I thought I did.She could tell by his plastic smile that he was trying to decide whether or not to believe her.Tell me about him, he said.Hes an MMA fighter, she answered.You know those guys in the cage?I think its crazy, but hes really into it.He works out and trains for hours every day and he loves to fight, so I kind of feel like I have to support him.She could imagine the wheels in his mind continuing to turn as she hoisted her bag over her shoulder.While I cant meet for lunch, do you want to talk in your office tomorrow?Im sure I can clear part of my morning or afternoon.When there are others around, she didnt bother adding.Im not sure thats necessary.Maybe I should talk to Barney?He shook his head, the movement almost imperceptible.Its probably best to let it go for now.Of course youd say that.Because this whole thing was a ruse and you never talked to Barney at all.All right.I guess Ill say good night, then.She reached the door, breathing a sigh of relief as she made her escape.The whole boyfriend thing had been inspired, but that card had now been played.It wouldnt surprise him again; hed be ready for it.In the long run  or maybe even in the short run  she doubted it would stop Kens advances, even if it had been true.Or became true?Still reeling from her encounter, she wondered if she wanted it to be true.All she knew for certain was that when Colin had kissed her, shed felt something electric, and the realization was both exhilarating and frightening  at exactly the same time.Though shed been lying when she told Ken that she was having dinner with her parents, she wasnt in the mood to be alone and found herself driving the familiar roads to the place shed grown up.The neighborhood was more blue collar than white, with homes showing signs of deferred maintenance and a few sporting FOR SALE signs.Older model cars and trucks were parked in virtually every driveway.Their neighbors had always been plumbers and carpenters, clerical workers and secretaries.It was the kind of community where kids played in the front yards and young couples pushed strollers, where people would collect the mail for each other when they were out of town.Though her parents never talked about it, Maria had heard rumors growing up that when her dad had first bought the house, more than a few neighbors living at this end of the block had been upset.The Sanchezes were the first nonwhite family on the street, and people had quietly speculated about declining property values and rising crime, as though everyone whod been born in Mexico was somehow connected to the drug cartels.She supposed it was one of the reasons that her dad had always kept the yard immaculate and the bushes trimmed; he repainted the exterior in the same color every fifth year, always parked his cars in the garage instead of the driveway, and kept an American flag mounted on a pole on the front porch.He decorated the house for both Halloween and Christmas and in their first years would hand out restaurant coupons to any neighbor who happened to be outside, allowing them to eat at half price.Her mom regularly made trays of food on the weekend afternoons when she wasnt at the restaurant  burritos and enchiladas, tacos or carnitas  which she would serve to any of the kids who were out playing kickball or soccer.Little by little, theyd been accepted in the neighborhood.Since then, most of the surrounding homes had been sold more than once, and in every instance, her parents showed up to welcome the new owners with a housewarming gift in the hopes of preventing future whispers.Maria sometimes had trouble imagining how hard it had been, though in school, thered been more than a couple of years when shed been the only Mexican in her classroom.Because shed been a good student, albeit a quiet one, she couldnt remember feeling the sting of discrimination in the same way her parents had experienced it, but even if she had, her parents would have told her to do what they had done.They would have told her to be herself, to be kind and welcoming to everyone, and they would have warned her that she should never sink to others level.And then, she thought with a smile, they would have told her to study.Unlike Serena, who was still reveling in finally being out from under her parents thumbs, Maria enjoyed coming home.She loved the old place: the green and orange walls; the wildly playful ceramic tile in the kitchen; the eclectic furniture her mother had collected over the years; a refrigerator door that was endlessly decorated with photos and information relating to the family, anything that had made Carmen particularly proud.She loved the way her mother hummed whenever she was happy and especially when she was cooking.Growing up, Maria had taken these things for granted, but beginning in college, she could remember a feeling of comfort whenever she pushed through the front door, even after just a few weeks away.Knowing her parents would be offended if she knocked, she went straight in, moving through the living room and into the kitchen.She set her bag on the counter.Mom?Dad?Where are you?she called out.As always when at home, she spoke Spanish, the shift from English as simple as breathing and just as unconscious.Out here!she heard her mom answer.Maria turned toward the back porch, where she saw her mom and dad rising from the table.Happy she was here and leaning in for hugs, they both spoke at once.We didnt know you were coming  What a nice surprise  You look wonderful  Youre so skinny  Are you hungry?Maria greeted her mom, then her dad, then her mom again, then her dad a second time.In her parents minds, Maria would always be their little girl.And though thered been a period for a few teenage years when the idea had mortified her  especially when apparent in public  these days she had to admit that she kind of liked it.Im okay.I can grab something later.Ill make you something, her mom said decisively, moving toward the refrigerator.Her dad watched her go with obvious appreciation.He had always been a hopeless romantic.In his midfifties, he was neither thin nor fat.He had little gray in his hair, but Maria noticed a lingering, almost constant weariness, the effect of too much work for too many years.Tonight he seemed even less energetic than usual.Making you dinner makes her feel like shes still important to you, he said.Of course shes still important to me.Why would she think otherwise?Because you dont need her the way you once did.Im not a child.But shell always be your mother, he said firmly.He motioned toward the table on the porch.Do you want to sit outside and enjoy some wine?Your mom and I were having a glass.I can get it, she said.Let me talk to Mom for a bit and Ill meet you out there.While her dad returned to the porch, she retrieved a glass from the cupboard and poured herself some wine before sidling up to her mother.By then, Carmen had loaded up a casserole dish with pot roast, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a biscuit  enough calories for a couple of days, Maria estimated  and was sliding the dish into the oven.For whatever reason  maybe because it was something they never served at the restaurant  her dad loved pot roast and mashed potatoes.Im so glad you came by, her mom said.Whats wrong?Nothings wrong, Maria said.She leaned against the counter and took a sip of wine.I just wanted to surprise you.So you say.But something must have happened, she said.You never visit us during the week.Thats why its a surprise.Carmen evaluated her before crossing over to the counter and retrieving her own wineglass.Is it your sister?Is what my sister?She didnt get turned down for the scholarship, did she?You know about that?Carmen motioned to a letter tacked up on the refrigerator.Its exciting, isnt it?She told us about it last night.The director will be coming to dinner this Saturday.Really?We wanted to meet him, she said.The letter says that shes one of the semifinalists.But back to your sister.What happened?If its not about that, then it must have something to do with a boy.Shes not in trouble, is she?Her mom was talking so fast that even Maria had trouble keeping up.Serenas fine, as far as I know.Ah.Her mother nodded.Good.Its something at your work, then.Youre the one having problems.Work is work.Why would you think theres a problem?Because you came straight here afterwards.So?Thats what youve always done whenever something was bothering you.Dont you remember?Even in college, if you thought you got a bad grade, or when you were having trouble with your roommate your freshman year, or whenever you fought with Luis, you always came here.Mothers remember those kinds of things.Huh, she thought.I never realized that.She changed the subject.I think you worry too much.And I think I know my daughter.Maria smiled.Hows Dad?Hes been quiet since he got home.He had to fire two people this week.What did they do?Same old stuff.One of the dishwashers skipped a couple of shifts, and one of the waiters was letting his friends eat for free.You know how it goes.But its still hard on your father.He wants to trust everyone, and hes always disappointed when people let him down.It wears on him.When he got home today, he took a nap instead of taking Copo out for a walk.Maybe he needs to see a doctor.Thats what we were talking about when you came in.What does he say?He says hell go.But you know him.Unless I make the appointment, hell never get around to it.Do you want me to call for you?Would you mind?Of course not, Maria answered.Because of her moms language skills, shed been making appointments ever since she was a young girl.Its still Dr.Clark, right?Her mom nodded.And schedule him for a full physical if you can.Hes not going to like that.No, but he needs one.Its been almost three years.He shouldnt wait that long.Hes got high blood pressure.And last year, he had those chest pains and he couldnt work for a week.I know, and you know, but hes stubborn and he insists his heart is fine.Maybe you can talk some sense into him.Her mom reached over and opened the oven; satisfied, she put on an oven mitt and pulled out the casserole dish before beginning to load up a plate for Maria.Thats plenty, she said, trying to limit the quantity.You need to eat, her mom insisted, continuing to pile food on the plate while Maria retrieved some utensils.Lets go sit with your father.Outside at the table, a citronella candle was burning to keep the mosquitoes at bay.The night was as perfect as her dad had promised, with only the slightest breeze and a sky embroidered with stars.Copo sat in her fathers lap, snoring slightly while his hand moved rhythmically through her fur.Maria began to cut a hunk of the pot roast into smaller pieces.I heard what happened today, Maria started, initiating a stream of conversation encompassing the restaurant, local news, and the latest family gossip.In an extended family like theirs, there was always some kind of drama worth talking about and dissecting.By the time Maria had finished dinner  no more than a quarter of the plate  the crickets had begun their evening melody.You look like you got some sun last weekend.I went paddleboarding after we had brunch.With your new friend?her mom inquired.The one from the pier?At Marias startled expression, her mom shrugged.I heard you and Serena talking.Your sister can be kind of loud sometimes.Serena strikes again, Maria thought.She hadnt wanted to bring it up, but she couldnt deny it now, could she?Even her father appeared to have a sudden heightened interest in the conversation.His names Colin.Then, knowing her parents would press for more but not wanting them to delve too deeply, she went on.Serena knows him from her classes, and when she and I had dinner on Saturday, Colin was tending bar there.We got to talking at the pier and decided to meet up on Sunday.Hes in college?How old is he?Hes my age.He didnt start college until a couple of years ago.He wants to become a teacher.Serena said he was very handsome, her mother commented with a mischievous smile.Thanks, Serena.Next time, lower your voice.He is.And you had a good time?It was a lot of fun.When can we meet him?Dont you think its a little early for that?Maria said.It depends.Are you going out again?Uh, yes on Saturday.Then we should meet him.You should invite him to brunch on Sunday.Maria opened her mouth and then closed it again.There was no way her parents were ready for Colin, especially when thered be no chance at escape.The thought that Colin would answer whatever questions they asked with his usual directness was enough to give her heart palpitations.She smiled at her dad with a trace of desperation.Why did he wait so long to go to college?he asked.She considered the best way to answer while still telling the truth.He didnt figure out that he wanted to be a teacher until a couple of years ago.Of her parents, her dad had always been better at reading between the lines, and she suspected he would continue to press for more details about Colins past.But he was interrupted by the faint but audible ringing of a cell phone in the kitchen.Oh, thats me, she said, thanking God for the reprieve.Let me get that.Rising from the table, she raced into the kitchen.Pulling her phone from her bag, she saw Colins name.She felt like a teenager as she pressed the button and raised the phone to her ear.Hey there, she said, I was just talking about you.She paced the living room as they talked, catching up on how each had spent their day.As in person, he was an attentive listener, and when he sensed something in her voice, she found herself telling him about the incident with Ken.He grew quiet then, and when she asked whether hed be interested in meeting her for lunch, he said hed love to and asked what time he should pick her up at the office.She smiled, knowing that it would give her story more credence with Ken, and was secretly thrilled at the idea of seeing Colin so soon.When she hung up the phone, she had the sense that despite what her parents would no doubt think, Colin might be just what she needed in her life right now.She returned to the porch, where her parents were still waiting at the table.Sorry, she said, reaching for her wineglass.That was Colin.And he called just to say hello?Maria nodded.Were going to lunch tomorrow.As soon as the words were out of her mouth, she regretted them.Her mother could never comprehend why anyone would consider going anywhere else besides the family restaurant.Wonderful, her mom said.Ill make something special for the two of you.CHAPTER 9      Colin      R  eally?Evan called out, leaning over the porch rail as Colin crossed the yard.You went running again?Colin was still breathing hard as he veered toward the porch, finally slowing to a walk.He pulled up his shirt to wipe his face before peering up at his friend.I didnt run earlier today.You worked out this afternoon.And this morning.That was at the gym.So?Its not the same, he answered, knowing that Evan really didnt care one way or the other.Instead, he nodded toward the front door.Why arent you inside with Lily?Because my house smells.What does this have to do with me?How about the fact that I can smell the stench from your clothes wafting up through the vents like a green, putrid fog?Instead of heading out to run, you should have done a load of laundry.Or better yet, you should start burning your workout clothes on a daily basis.Lily actually thought there was a dead mouse in the pantry.Or that the sewage had backed up.Colin smiled.Ill get right to it.Hurry up.And then meet me back over here.Lily wants to talk to you.Why?I have no idea.She wouldnt tell me.But if I was to guess, Id say its about your girlfriend.I dont have a girlfriend.Whatever.The point is, she wants to talk to you.Why?Because shes Lily, Evan said, sounding exasperated.She probably wants to ask whether youve handwritten a card to Maria with fancy calligraphy.Or shell offer to help you select the perfect silk scarf for Marias birthday.Or she wants to make sure you use the right spoon for your soup if you take her to the country club.You know how she is.But she brought home an extra bag, and she wont tell me whats in it.Why not?Stop asking questions that I cant answer!Evan sighed.All I know for sure is that every time I tried to make my move, she told me that I had to wait.Because of you.And just so you know?Im not happy about it.I was really looking forward to tonight.I needed tonight.Ive had a crappy day.Okay.Evan scowled at Colins answer.Why was it crappy, you ask?he said, mimicking Colin.Gee, thanks for asking, Colin.I appreciate your empathy.You plainly care about my well being.He stared down at his friend.It turns out that there was a terrible jobs report this morning, and the market tanked.And though I have no control over those things, I was nonetheless on the phone all afternoon with upset clients.And then, I get home and my house smells like a locker room, and now I have to wait for her to talk to you before my night can really begin.Let me change first.Ill be over in a couple of minutes.I surely hope not, Lily said to Colin, suddenly appearing next to Evan on the porch, wearing a yellow sundress.She slid her hand into her fiancs and smiled up at him sweetly.You wouldnt think of letting him come over without a chance to shower, would you, Evan?The poor man is practically soaked through.We can surely wait a few more minutes.Merely allowing him to change his clothes wouldnt be proper.When Evan didnt answer, Colin cleared his throat.She does have a point, Evan.It wouldnt be proper.Evan glared.Fine.Go shower.And start your laundry.And then come over.Oh, dont be so hard on him, Lily scolded.Its not his fault that you invested your clients money in the wrong companies.She secretly winked at Colin.I didnt invest in the wrong companies!It wasnt my fault!Everything was down today.Im just teasing you, sugar, she drawled.I know you had an awful day and that it wasnt your fault.That mean old Mr.Market just took advantage of you, didnt he?Youre not helping, Evan said.Lily turned her attention to Colin again.Have you spoken to your lady friend today?she asked.I talked to her before I went running.Did you bring flowers to her office like I recommended?No.Candy?No.Whatever am I going to do with you?I dont know.She smiled before tugging Evans hand.Well see you in a few minutes, okay?Colin watched them head back inside before entering his apartment.He stripped on his way to the bathroom and added his clothes to the laundry pile, noting that Evan was right.The pile reeked.He started a load of laundry and hopped in the shower.Afterward, he threw on a pair of jeans and a T shirt before making his way back to Evans.Evan and Lily were sitting beside each other on the couch.Of the two, it was clear that Lily was the only one who was happy Colin was there.Colin!Im so pleased you could join us, Lily said, rising from her spot, obviously ignoring the fact that theyd just talked.May we offer you something to drink?Water, please.Evan?Will you please get Colin some water?Why?Evan asked, leaning back, his arm over the top of the couch.He knows where it is.He can get his own water.Lily turned toward him.Its your home.And youre the host.I didnt ask him to come over.You did.Evan?The way she said his name made it plain that Evan had no choice in the matter.That and the way she looked, of course.She was not only far and away the most beautiful woman Evan had ever dated, but she was well versed in the ways of using her appearance to her advantage.Fine, he grumbled, rising from the couch.Ill get him a glass of water.Evan slouched off toward the kitchen.With ice, please, Colin called out.Evan scowled over his shoulder before Colin took a seat in the easy chair across from Lily.How are you this evening?she asked.Okay.And Maria?Earlier on the phone, Maria had told him what had happened with her boss Ken Martenson and as hed listened, Colin had found his jaw beginning to clench.Though hed kept his voice steady, hed imagined having a little talk with Ken, the kind that made it clear that it was in Kens best interest to stop bothering her.He hadnt said that to Maria, but when he found himself grinding his teeth after hanging up, hed thrown on his workout gear and gone running.It wasnt until hed nearly finished his run that hed begun to feel normal again.That wasnt, however, what Lily had asked him.I spoke to her just a little while ago.And shes doing well?He thought about her job situation, but it wasnt his place to share that information.It was her life, her story, not his.I think she was glad to hear from me, he said truthfully.You hadnt called her?I called her Sunday night.After I talked to you and Evan.And you didnt call her on either Monday or Tuesday?I was working.You could have called on the way to or from work.Or on your break.Or on your way to class or the gym.Yes.But you didnt.No.But were going to lunch tomorrow.Really?Someplace special, I hope.I havent really thought about it.Lily didnt bother to hide her disappointment.Evan reentered the room with a large glass of ice water.He thrust it out for Colin.Thanks, Evan, Colin said.You didnt have to do that.I could have gotten it.Ha, ha, Evan answered as he sat back down.Then, to Lily: Now, what did you want to talk to him about?We were discussing his lunch date tomorrow.Colin has informed me that he and Maria will be dining together.My advice?Make sure your car starts, Evan said.Lily glanced with disapproval in his direction.My primary concern has to do with his date this weekend, and I wanted to discuss the matter with him.Why?Evan asked.Because the first true evening one spends with the other is a critical time in any relationship, she answered, as though it were obvious.Had Colin simply invited Maria to dinner or perhaps to walk the promenade downtown, I would have no worries at all.Or had he suggested that the four of us go out together, Im sure that the conversation would be so engaging that Maria would have a wonderful time as well.Alas, Colin is going to be on his own and hes bringing Maria to a club, though I am certain that issue has already been addressed.Evan raised his eyebrow.Colin said nothing.Lily focused her attention on Colin again.I asked you to visit with us this evening because I was curious if you have any experience or even familiarity with salsa dancing.No.Then, most likely, what you also dont know is that salsa is a partner dance.Thats what dancing is, Evan cut in.Lily ignored her fianc.Salsa dancing can be very enjoyable if the couple practices together, she explained.But since thats not possible in this situation, you will have to do the best you can, and there are things you have to know.Like the way to move your feet, or lead your partner in a spin, or offer her the chance to separate and perform a few moves on her own, all the while making it feel as though it is a natural part of the dance all along.If you dont do those things, it will be almost impossible to impress her.Evan laughed.Who says he wants to impress her?Colin doesnt care what anyone thinks   Go on, Colin said, cutting him off.Evan turned toward him in surprise while Lily sat up straighter.Im pleased you understand the dilemma youre in.What Im trying to tell you is that you need to learn the basics.For a moment, neither Colin nor Evan said anything.And just how is he supposed to learn the basics?Evan finally asked.We live in Wilmington.I highly doubt there are any salsa dance instructors who will clear their schedules in the next couple of days so my friend here wont embarrass himself.Lily leaned over, reaching for the small bag that had been placed next to the couch and pulling out an assortment of CDs.These are salsa albums, and youll need to listen to them.I called my old dance teacher and she was more than happy to send a few samples.Nothing is very recent, but thats not important.Salsa is more about speed and rhythm  the beat, so to speak  than melody.And as for the instructor, I will be more than happy to help Colin learn what he needs to know.You know how to salsa dance?Evan asked.Of course, she answered.I danced for almost twelve years, and at various times, we focused on alternative dancing.Alternative?Evan asked.I grew up in Charleston.Anything other than the shag or the waltz is considered alternative, she said, as though this were the kind of thing any civilized Southerner would know.But really, Evan.You need to let Colin ask the questions.Hes barely been able to say a single word.She turned to Colin.Would you allow me to be your instructor for the next couple of days?How much time are we talking about?Ill show you a few things tonight  the basic steps and movements, turns, and how to lead your partner through a spin  so you know what youll be working on.After that, well need three hours tomorrow evening, and another three hours on Friday evening.After I finish work and change, so beginning around six.And obviously, you should practice in your spare time before you get here.Will that be enough?Its not nearly time enough to be good.Or even average.To be truly proficient at any form of dancing can take years.But if you focus and do exactly what I tell you, it just might be enough for your date on Saturday.Colin took a sip of water, not answering right away.Dont tell me youre actually considering this, Evan said to him.Of course hes considering it.He knows Im right.Colin lowered the glass to his lap.Okay, he said.But Ill have to get someone to cover my shift on Friday night.Wonderful.Lily smiled.Wait, Evan said, turning to Lily.I thought we were going out on Friday.Im very sorry, but Im going to have to cancel.A friend needs my help, and I honestly cant decline.Hes been so sweet about asking.Seriously?Dont I get any say in this?Of course you do, Lily said.Youll be here both nights, too.As well as tonight, obviously.Here?Where else?I dont know.A dance studio, maybe?Dont be silly.Theres no need for that.But I will need you to move the furniture in the living room.Youre right about us needing space to work.And youll be responsible for the music, too  skipping back or forward when I tell you, starting the song over, things like that.We really need to maximize the use of our time.Youll be my little helper.Little helper?She smiled at him.Did I mention that salsa dancing can really make a woman feel sensual?And that the feeling can last for hours afterwards?Evan swallowed, staring at her.Id be glad to help.You folded like a cheap suit, Colin said.He and Evan were moving the couch to one side of the room while Lily went to the bedroom to fetch the proper pair of shoes, with just the right heel height, and change her clothes.Lily never did anything halfway.Whatever it takes to help a friend.Colin smiled.Okay.And after were done, youre going to help me put the furniture back.Okay.And youre not going to ask to stay longer to practice, either.Youre out of here by nine oclock.Okay.They set the couch down.I dont know how she talks me into things like this.Colin shrugged.I think I have a pretty good idea.Once the furniture was out of the way and the area rug rolled up, Lily pulled Colin into the center of the room.Evan sat glumly on the couch, books and a lamp and assorted knickknacks on the cushion beside him.Lily had changed into tight white jeans, a red silk blouse, and a pair of shoes that probably cost more than Colin earned in a week.Though she was Evans fiance and Colins friend, Colin was aware that she fairly oozed sex appeal.Dont get too close, Colin, Evan called out.Hush, now, Lily told him, all business.You may be wondering why I changed, she said to Colin.Not really, Colin answered.I changed so you can watch what my feet are doing.As I mentioned, Im going to show you the most basic step, upon which much of salsa dancing is based.Its one you can always fall back on, no matter what Maria is doing.Does that make sense?Yes.Before we begin, Im making the assumption that Maria knows how to salsa dance.She told me she used to dance all the time.Perfect.Lily moved beside him, both of them facing the window, allowing Evan a profile view.That means shell be able to follow your lead.Are you ready?Yes.Then watch my feet and do exactly what Im doing, she said.Step out with your left foot  thats a one count  then shift your weight onto the toe of your right foot  thats two  now bring the left foot back to its starting position  thats three  and pause for a beat  thats four.She demonstrated and Colin did the same.Now, step back with your right foot  thats five  shift your weight to the toe of your left foot  six  then bring your right foot forward again to its starting position  seven  and pause again for a beat.Thats eight.And youre done.Again, Colin followed her lead.Thats it?She nodded.Lets do it again, okay?They did.Then did it again.And again and again, repeating the movement over and over as Lily counted from one to eight, and then a dozen more times, and then gradually speeding up, and then continuing without counting.They took a break, then started slowly from the beginning, gradually speeding up again.Once he felt he was getting the hang of it, Lily stopped and watched as Colin continued.Thats perfect, she said, nodding.You have the steps now, but the real key to this is not to be so bouncy.Right now, youre moving like a ruffian marching through the swamp.You want to be smoother, like a blossom slowly beginning to open.Keep your shoulders at the same height throughout the steps.How do I do that?Use more hips, she said.Like this.As she showed him what she meant  gliding through the movements, her hips sashaying back and forth, her shoulders level throughout  Lily was right about the dance being sensual.From the corner of his eye, Colin noted that Evan was sitting up straighter and staring at Lily, though she didnt seem to notice.So now, lets do the exact same thing again, this time with some music, and concentrate on being smoother.She turned toward Evan.Sugar?Would you mind starting the song over?Evan shook his head, like a man trying to wake up from a dream.What?Did you say something?They danced for a little more than two hours.In addition to the basic step, Colin learned how to turn, and at that point, they began to dance together.Lily showed him where to place his right hand (on her upper back, just below her arm, he reminded himself), and she showed him how to lead her through three different spins by making tiny signals with his left hand, which required him to take slightly different steps before falling back into the basic footfalls again.Through it all, she reminded him to glide and use his hips, maintain eye contact, keep in rhythm with the beat, stop counting out loud, and smile.It required more concentration than hed imagined.Afterward, they put the furniture back in place and Colin made to leave.Lily held Evans hand as Colin stepped onto the porch.You did very well tonight, Lily said.You have a natural rhythm when it comes to dancing.Its a bit like boxing, he observed.I surely hope not, she said, sounding almost offended.He smiled.Tomorrow night, right?Six oclock sharp, she said.She handed him a CD.This is for you.Tomorrow, whenever you have extra time during the day, I insist that you practice your steps and turns and pretend to lead your partner through a spin.Concentrate on your hand signals, and try to be smooth.It would be most unproductive if we had to start over.Okay, he said.And Lily?Yes?Thank you, he said.Youre welcome, Colin.She smiled.Id be remiss, however, if I didnt take the opportunity to address another issue that has recently come to mind.Colin waited expectantly.Concerning your luncheon date tomorrow with Maria, Im sure I dont have to remind you that youll be meeting her in a professional setting, which requires a more formal manner of dress.Nor, I hope, do I have to remind you that as much as you love your car, there is nothing less inviting than a cluttered interior, or a car that wont start.Am I correct in my assumptions?Ive tried to fix my car for reasons other than Maria, but now that you mention it Yes, he answered.Im pleased, she said, nodding.A woman, after all, has certain expectations when it comes to courting.Now, as far as the flowers go have you decided what to bring?Knowing that different bouquets might carry with them various assumptions?Lily sounded so serious that it was hard for Colin not to smile.What do you recommend?She raised a manicured hand to her chin.Well, considering that the two of you are still getting to know each other, and that its only a lunch date, a bouquet of roses is far too formal, and lilies  while lovely  are much more suited to the spring.Carnations, obviously, convey nothing at all other than being an inexpensive choice, so that simply wont do.Colin nodded.Makes sense to me.Perhaps a simple autumn bouquet, then?With a mixture of yellow spray roses, bronze daisies, and maybe just a stem of red hypericum?She nodded thoughtfully.Yes, that strikes me as perfect for this occasion.Youll need to ask to have the flowers arranged in a vase, obviously, so she can place it in her office, but its clearly the right choice for this occasion, dont you think?Without a doubt.And make sure to order them from Michaels Florist.Hes really quite an artist when it comes to arrangements.Call him first thing in the morning and mention my name.Hell know what to do.Evan smirked, clearly enjoying this and probably suspecting that Colin would be no different than he was when it came to Lily and her requests.And because Evan knew him better than anyone, Colin finally nodded.Okay.In the morning, Colin rose early and was pleased to find that the old Camaro started on the first turn of the key.He put in a hard workout at the gym  plyometrics and barbell work, jumping rope, and long intervals on both the heavy and speed bags.On the way back to his apartment he stopped by a Dumpster and cleared the clutter from his car.At home, with his muscles still warm and loose, he popped in one of Lilys CDs and spent half an hour practicing his salsa steps, amazed that he hadnt forgotten anything.He was surprised again at how much concentration it required.He downed a protein smoothie and showered, then dressed in dark slacks, loafers, and a button down shirt, leftovers from his courtroom days.Hed put on serious muscle since then and the shirt was too tight in the chest and arms, but it was the best he could do.Standing in front of the mirror, he thought to himself that, aside from the top being a bit snug, Evan might as well have dressed him.The outfit was ridiculous, especially since hed be on a campus where shorts and flip flops were the norm.Though he knew that Lily wouldnt have approved, he rolled the cuffs, exposing a bit of his forearms.Better.More comfortable, too.His classmates either didnt notice or didnt care about his dress, and he listened and took notes as always.No Serena afterward, as they only had classes together on Mondays and Wednesdays.With a few extra minutes, he called the florist and ordered an autumn bouquet, whatever the hell that was.From there he trudged off to a classroom management class, aware that he hadnt stopped moving since the alarm had gone off, his regular routine in tatters.His final class of the day ended at a quarter to noon.By then, the sun was high, and with Indian summer hanging on, he walked slowly to his car, trying not to sweat.He stopped at the florist on the way to the address Maria had given him, and as if fate was toying with him, it took two turns of the key and a bit of pedal pumping to get the engine going.All he could do was keep his fingers crossed.Martenson, Hertzberg & Holdman occupied its own building, a relatively modern structure a couple of blocks from the Cape Fear River and smack dab in the middle of the historic district, with parking on both sides of the building.On either side and across the street, the buildings ran together, one shade of brick giving way to another, storefronts dotted with awnings.He pulled into a spot only a few slots away from Marias car, and next to a shiny red Corvette.He grabbed the vase of flowers  remembering Lily and her phrase certain expectations  and then thought about Ken and the problems he was causing.He wondered if the guy would be around; he wanted to put a face to a name.As he locked his car, he suddenly saw the entire morning as a countdown to the time when he could finally see Maria again.Surprising no one more than himself, he realized that hed missed her.CHAPTER 10      Maria      W  ith Barney holed up in his office, readying himself for trial, Maria was on double duty.She spent the morning touching base with clients, doing her best to ensure that each one felt their case was still a priority.Every half hour or so, their paralegal, Lynn, would enter with even more documents or forms to be filed, and though it was all Maria could do to keep up, staying busy had the benefit of keeping her from fretting about her lunch date.Or, more accurately, how her parents were going to react when they met Colin.For starters  and unlike Luis  Colin was a gringo, and while it wasnt that big of a deal for people in her generation, her parents were probably going to be surprised.Allowing them to meet Colin meant the relationship was getting serious, and theyd probably always assumed Maria would only seriously date someone who was Mexican.Everyone in her family  even relatives by marriage  was Mexican, and there were cultural differences.Her family celebrated every family get together with a piata for the kids, listened to mariachi music, watched telenovelas obsessively, and spoke only Spanish among themselves.Some of her aunts and uncles spoke no English at all.She knew it wouldnt necessarily be a problem for her parents, but theyd probably wonder why Maria hadnt mentioned Colins background.The rest of her familys opinions about it would probably fall along generational lines, with the younger relatives more likely to shrug off the idea as inconsequential.Still, she had no doubt that it was going to be a topic of conversation among the family at the restaurant, one that would probably continue long after Maria and Colin said good bye.Those things she could deal with.What she wasnt sure she could handle was any discussion concerning Colins past, which she knew was unavoidable.Ordinary conversation ensured it, and what was going to happen if either her mom or her dad started asking him questions today?She supposed she could head off the answers by stating that they were simply friends and steering the conversation in another direction, but how long could she keep that up?Unless their relationship petered out after Saturday  and Maria admitted that she hoped it wouldnt  Colins past was going to come up.And what had Serena said about that?I dont even want to be in the same state when you drop that little bombshell.To her parents, it wouldnt matter that she was a grown woman; theyd make their displeasure known, assuring themselves that they were doing the right thing, since it was obvious that Maria had no idea what she was getting herself into.And the crazy thing was, her parents were probably right.You have a visitor, Jill said.Maria was hanging up with Gwen, the receptionist, whod just shared the same information when Jill appeared in her doorway, a handbag already over her shoulder.I just heard, she answered, noting that it was a quarter past twelve.I dont know where the morning went.It feels like I just got here.Jill smiled.I take it that you and Colin are going out?Yeah, about that, Maria said.Im sorry I didnt have a chance to tell you earlier that I had plans, but Ive been slammed all morning.I barely had a second to breathe.No worries, Jill said, waving it off.I remember the whole work till you drop drill when Barneys getting ready for trial.Actually, I was coming by to tell you that I was planning to surprise Paul at his office and make him take me out.Are you sure you dont mind?Not about lunch.But I do wish you had warned me that Colin was coming by.I would have had Paul come by here, too, so he could see for himself what eating right and working out will do for a man.Pauls fine.Easy for you to say.Look at whos waiting for you in the lobby.Paul, on the other hand, is getting a little soft and he doesnt even care.And I know he doesnt care, because Ive been dropping little self improvement hints.As in, Put the cookie down and hop on the treadmill, for Gods sake.You dont really say that.No, but I think it.Its the same thing.Maria laughed as she gathered her things and stood.Do you want to walk with me?Thats why Im still waiting.I also want to see your face when you find out.Find out what?Youll know soon enough.What are you talking about?Come on, Jill said.And make sure you introduce us.I want to tell Paul all about it, especially if your beau flirts with me.Colins not really the flirting type.Who cares?The truth is, I just want to get a closer peek at him.To make sure hes good enough for you, of course.Thats very kind of you.What are friends for?As they started down the hallway, Maria took a deep breath, feeling her worries reassert themselves.Thankfully, Jill didnt notice, her mind clearly elsewhere.Hold up a second, she said.Maria watched as Jill reached into her handbag.Pulling out her lipstick, she applied some before dropping it back into her bag.Okay, Jill said, now we can go.Maria stared at her.Really?Jill winked.What can I say?First impressions matter.Up ahead, Maria watched as two paralegals suddenly rounded the corner from the lobby, whispering excitedly to each other like a couple of high schoolers.Jill nodded toward them.Now do you understand what I mean?You were definitely holding out on me.That is one gorgeous man.Hes not that good looking.Uh yeah.He is.Now come on.Youve got a date and you shouldnt be late.As soon as Maria spotted Colin in the lobby, her stomach did a little flip flop.He was facing the opposite direction  waiting for her, she realized  and from the back he could have passed for a young lawyer, albeit an exceptionally fit one with visible tattoos.When Maria glanced toward the receptionist, she noted that Gwen was trying hard not to stare at Colin while she worked the phone.Colin must have sensed their presence, and when he turned, Maria caught sight of a lovely assortment of flowers; oranges and yellows, with a burst of red in the center.Her mouth dropped open slightly.Surprise, Jill whispered, but Maria was too shocked to hear it.Oh, she finally said.Hi.Beginning to approach, she was only vaguely aware that Jill had remained behind.Up close, his clean scent mingled with that of the flowers.New clothes?Freedom clothes, he answered.They probably kept me out of prison.She smiled, amused.And in the next instant, she thought, And I cant believe his answer doesnt worry me.But she didnt want to think about that.Instead, she nodded at the flowers.For me?Yes, he said, handing them over.Its an autumn bouquet.Theyre beautiful.Thank you.Youre welcome.Let me put them in my office.Ill be right back and then we can go.Okay.Behind her, she heard Jill clear her throat and she turned.Oh, this is my friend Jill.Shes an attorney here, too.Jill approached and he offered his hand.Hi, Jill.Hi, Colin.She took his hand, her demeanor friendly yet professional.Its a pleasure to meet you.Leaving them to chat, Maria hurried back to her office, noticing the two paralegals who eyed her with a touch of envy as she passed them.She tried to remember the last time someone had bought her flowers.Aside from a single rose that Luis had given her on Valentines Day after theyd been dating for a year, she couldnt remember a single instance.Setting the vase in a prominent place in her office, she returned to the lobby just in time to catch the tail end of Jill and Colins conversation.Jill turned.I hear youre a much better photographer than you let on.Colin says you took an amazing shot of some porpoises?Hes being overly kind, Maria said.I get lucky every now and then.Id still like to see it.Ill e mail it, she said.Then, to Colin: Are you ready?Colin nodded, and after saying good bye to Jill, they headed down to the parking lot.Your friend is nice, Colin remarked.Shes great, Maria agreed.If it wasnt for her, I would have eaten alone at my desk since Ive been here.Until today, Colin said with a smile.How are things at work?Im buried, she admitted.But Im hoping things will slow down.My boss is going to be out of the office this afternoon and tomorrow  If thats the case, I wouldnt recommend throwing a massive party and trashing the office in his absence.Ive learned that it tends to irritate people.Ill keep that in mind, she said as he opened the car door for her.She slid into the Camaro.Once Colin was behind the wheel, he leaned toward her, keys in hand.I was thinking we could head over to one of the restaurants downtown?Wed probably be able to get a table outside with a great view.Oh yeah, she thought.About that.Maria fiddled with the seatbelt, wondering how best to explain it.It sounds wonderful, she ventured, and ordinarily, Id love to go.But the thing is, I was over at my parents house last night when you called, and I happened to mention that we were going to lunch, and She exhaled, deciding to simply come out with it.Theyre expecting us to have lunch at the restaurant.Colin tapped his car key on the seat.You want me to meet your parents?Not really.Not yet, anyway.But She wrinkled her nose, unsure how he would react, hoping he wouldnt be angry.Kind of.He slipped the keys into the ignition.Okay, he said.Really?It doesnt bother you?Even though we just met?No.Just so you know, it would bother a lot of guys.Okay.Well good, she said.He said nothing right away.Finally: Youre nervous.They dont know you like I do.She inhaled slowly, thinking, Now for the hard part.When you meet them, you have to understand that theyre old fashioned.My dad has always been protective and my mom worries, and Im afraid that if they start asking questions  When she trailed off, Colin finished for her.Youre worried what Ill say to them.And how theyll react.Though she didnt answer, she suspected that he already knew what she was thinking.I wont lie to them, he said.I know, she said.Thats the problem.And I wont ask you to lie.I dont want you to lie, but it still makes me nervous.Because of my past, he said.I wish I wouldnt have had to say anything to you, and Im sorry.Logically, I know that Im an adult and I should be able to date whomever I want and it shouldnt matter what they think.But it does.Because I still want their approval.And believe me, I know how awful that sounds.It doesnt sound awful.It sounds normal.You dont need approval.Evan would probably say that Im not normal.Despite the tension, she laughed before getting quiet again.Are you mad at me?No, he answered.But youre probably offended.No, he said again.What are you feeling, then?He didnt answer right away.I feel flattered, he finally offered.She blinked.Flattered?How on earth could you feel flattered?Its complicated.Id still like to hear it.He shrugged.Because you told me how you were feeling, even though you suspected it might hurt my feelings.And you told the truth.And you did both those things from a place of vulnerability and concern, because you want them to like me.Because you care about me.Thats flattering.She smiled, half from surprise and half because he was right.I think Im going to give up trying to predict anything about you ever again.Okay, he said.He twisted the key and the engine rumbled to life.Before he slipped it into gear, he turned toward her.So what do you want to do?Go to lunch?Hope for the best?Sounds like a plan.La Cocina de la Familia was located a few blocks off Market Street in an aging strip mall, but the parking spaces in front of the restaurant were full.As they approached the front door, Colin struck her as being as calm as ever, which only put Maria more on edge.He reached for her hand.She clasped his in return, like someone clutching a life preserver on a listing ship.I forgot to ask whether you even like Mexican food.I remember that I used to like it a lot.But you dont eat it anymore?Because its not healthy, right?I can always find something to order.She squeezed his hand, liking the way it felt in hers.My mom said shes going to make us something special.Which means you might not get the chance.That said, I did tell her that you liked healthy food.Itll be fine, he said.Do you ever worry about anything?I try not to.Well, when were done, youre going to start giving me lessons, all right?Because lately, that feels like the only thing Im doing.He pulled open the door and she led the way inside.Her uncle Tito immediately approached, obviously excited she was here, rambling in Spanish.After greeting her with a kiss, he shook Colins hand and reached for the menus before leading them to a booth in the corner.It was the only open table in the place, which meant that her parents must have been saving it.Once they were seated, her cousin Anna brought glasses of water and a basket of chips and salsa to the table.Maria chatted with her briefly and introduced Colin a second time.When Anna left, Maria leaned across the table.Im sorry, she said.I dont come in as much as I should.Theyre probably as excited as my parents.How many of your relatives work here?Right now?She made a quick scan of the place, spotting another uncle at the bar and a couple of aunts waiting on tables.Id guess theres probably six or so.But Id have to ask my parents to be sure.He surveyed the restaurant.Its busy in here.It always is.Over the years, weve had to expand the restaurant three times.When it first started, there were only eight tables.As she answered, she saw her parents emerge from the kitchen and she sat up straighter.Okay, theyre coming.My parents, I mean.When her parents reached the table, she kissed her mother, then her father, all the while hoping they wouldnt make a spectacle.This is my friend Colin, she said.These are my parents, Felix and Carmen.Hi, Felix and Carmen said, almost in unison, both of them plainly giving him the once over.Its a pleasure to meet you both, he said.Maria says youre a student?Felix said, jumping right in.And that you work as a bartender?Yes, Colin responded.Serenas actually in a couple of my classes.I work at Crabby Petes, down by the beach.Then, no doubt thinking of Marias worries and not wanting to get drawn into a long conversation about his past, he motioned around the restaurant.This is an incredible business youve built.How long has it been around?Thirty one years, Felix answered, a trace of pride in his voice.Maria said youve had to expand over the years.Thats impressive.Weve been blessed, Felix agreed.Have you eaten here before?No, Colin admitted.But Maria says your wife is an amazing chef.Felix stood a little straighter.She is the best, he said, glancing over at Carmen.Of course, because of that, she sometimes believes that she is the boss.I am the boss, Carmen said in somewhat broken English.Colin smiled, and after more small talk, Maria watched as her dad reached for her moms arm.Lets go.We should let them visit, Felix said.After saying good bye, Maria watched her parents start back toward the kitchen.You know theyre in there talking about you right now with Tito and Anna and all the rest of them.Aside from Luis, youre the only guy Ive ever brought here.Im honored, he said, and she had a feeling he actually meant it.It wasnt as bad as I thought it would be, she added.Theyre gracious people.Yes, but Im still their daughter.And they didnt ask any hard questions.Maybe they wont.Oh, they will eventually.Unless, of course, we never see each other again.Is that what you want?Maria dropped her eyes for a moment.No, she said.Im glad were here.And Im happy well be spending some time together this weekend.Which means?That the next time were all together  assuming there will be a next time  Im going to be even more nervous.Minutes later, Carmen and two of Marias cousins began ferrying food to the table: plates of tacos, burritos, mole poblano, and enchiladas; tamales, carne asada, chile relleno, tilapia Veracruz, and a bowl of salad.As her mom began placing the dishes on the table, Maria waved her hands.Mom  this is way too much, Maria protested.Even Colin appeared to be surprised as all the plates began to arrive.Eat what you want, Carmen answered in Spanish.Well bring the rest of it to the back and set it out.People will finish it.But  Carmen glanced at Colin, then back to Maria.Your sister was right.Hes very handsome.Mom!What?He doesnt understand me.Thats not the point!Its just good to see you happy.Your dad and I have been worried.All you ever do is work.She smiled before her gaze returned to Colin.Colin?Is that an Irish name?I have no idea.Is he Catholic?I havent asked him.What do you talk about?You have no idea, Maria thought.And you dont want to know.Its not polite to talk in front of him like this, you know.Of course, her mom said, squeezing the last plate between their water glasses.Youre absolutely right.Switching to English, she smiled at Colin.Please enjoy, she offered.Thank you.We will.A moment later, they were alone, mountains of food spread before them.It smells delicious, Colin said.Are you kidding?This is ridiculous!Who on earth could eat this much food?You sound upset.Of course Im upset.We should have been able to order off the menu, but instead, my mom had to do her thing.Whats her thing?Im still trying to figure it out.To impress you?To make sure you feel welcome?Those are good things.I know, but she tends to overdo it.She watched as Colins gaze moved from one plate to the next, and she pointed at the tilapia.I think my mom made this one special for you.Its just baked fish, with tomatoes, olives, and raisins.Go ahead and serve up.He took a couple of filets and added some salad to his plate; she also took one of the filets and salad, but added half an enchilada.The rest remained untouched.When Colin tasted the fish, he tapped his fork against his plate.This is unbelievable, he said.No wonder shes the boss.She is good.Can you cook like this?She shook her head.I wish.Im not nearly as good as my mom, but I started in the kitchen and I learned the basics on how to make everything.I enjoyed it, too, but after a while, my parents thought it would be better if I learned to wait tables.They thought that being forced to talk to strangers would help me overcome my shyness.Again with the shy?Obviously, in your estimation, it worked.And if youre curious, Im an excellent waitress.He laughed, and for the next hour they bounced from one subject to another  their favorite movies and the places they one day wanted to visit; he told her a bit more about his family and she did the same.Whenever she spoke, he listened with quiet concentration, his eyes never leaving hers.The conversation was easy and unforced, but through it all, she couldnt help feeling that he actually cared about everything she was saying.Despite her familys presence and the conversations drifting from other tables, their lunch together felt strangely intimate.By the time her parents dropped by their table a second time  and despite her mothers disappointment at how little either of them had eaten  Maria felt strangely relaxed and content.After a series of warm good byes, they drove back to the office, the old Camaro playing along perfectly.There, Colin walked her to the entryway, and when he slipped his hand into hers a second time, all she could think was how utterly natural it felt.At the entrance, she felt him tug gently, willing her to stop.What time on Saturday?she asked, turning to him.I have a training session at four that ends at six, so how about I pick you up at your place around seven thirty?Well have dinner first, and then head out?Sounds great, she said.What kind of training session?Striking and ground work, he said.Ground work is like wrestling.Can anyone watch?I guess so, he said.Im sure the gym owner wouldnt mind, but Id have to ask.Would you?Why?Do you want to come?Since were going dancing, I might as well watch you doing something you enjoy, too.He didnt hide his surprise.Okay, he said.But Ill have to head home to clean up before we go out, so is it okay if you meet me at the gym?When she nodded, he gave her the name of the gym, and she jotted her home address on the back of her business card.He slipped her card into his pocket and before she even realized what was happening, he was leaning in, his lips meeting hers.The kiss was gentle, and though it wasnt as electrifying as their kiss of the previous Sunday, there was something warm and reassuring about it.Suddenly it didnt matter what her parents might think.Here and now, Colin was the only thing that mattered, and when he pulled back, she found herself wishing that it had lasted a little longer.In that instant, however, she saw movement in her peripheral vision, and when she focused on it, she registered that Ken had rounded the corner  no doubt after parking on the other side of the building  and was standing motionless, watching them from a distance.She felt herself stiffen and Colin followed her gaze.Is that him?he asked, his voice low.Ken?Yes, she said, and she watched as his expression suddenly went hard.He didnt separate from her, but his attention zeroed in on Ken.Though he didnt squeeze her hand, she could feel the tension in it, a coiled, deep seated violence held in check by a thread.She wasnt afraid, but she had the sudden certainty that up close, Ken definitely would be.Ken continued to watch them.It was a standoff of sorts, and still Colin continued to stare, turning to face her again only after Ken turned away.He kissed her again, this time with a trace of possessiveness, before pulling back.Dont let him bother you.Hes not worth it, she said.Hes bothering you.Ill be fine.I still dont like him.Is that why you kissed me again?No.Then why did you do it?I like you, he answered.His comment  so direct, so obviously truthful  made her stomach do that ridiculous flip flop again, and it was all she could do not to grin like a fool.What are you doing tonight and Friday?I have plans with Evan and Lily.Both nights?Yes.What are you doing?I dont want to tell you.Why?I dont want to tell you that, either.She squeezed his hand before letting go.I know youre telling the truth, but youre not really saying anything.Should I be worried?Are you going out with someone else?No, he said, shaking his head.Theres nothing to worry about.I had a great time at lunch today.I enjoyed meeting your parents.She peered up at him.Im glad.He smiled then before finally taking a step backward.Its probably time for you to go back to work.I know.Is he still watching us?She peeked past him and shook her head.I think he went around to the back entrance.Will he be bothered by what he saw?She thought about it.Probably.But now he knows you actually exist, and thats a good thing.If he bothers me again, Ill just hint that youre the jealous type.Im not, he said.His blue gray eyes were intense, yet gentle.But I still dont like him.CHAPTER 11      Colin      O  n Saturday morning, Colin rose early and went for a bike ride just as the sun was coming up.His bike  a rusting beater that hed picked up at a pawn shop for almost nothing  was at least a decade old, but it did the job, and he was able to work up a serious sweat before he even reached the gym.There, he spent an hour in a cross training class slamming heavy ropes, pushing weighted sleds, throwing medicine balls, and doing a variety of other exercises, then staggered back to his bike for the ride home.He mowed the lawn and trimmed the bushes, reflecting that though hed been preoccupied by thoughts of Maria since theyd first met, those thoughts didnt compare to the almost obsessive way he dwelled on her now.Even Evan had noticed; earlier, when hed stepped out onto the porch, hed been wearing a smirk that let Colin know he was fully aware of the effect that Maria was having on him.Evan himself had been ebullient on both Thursday and Friday nights, and Colin suspected that it might have had something to do with the whole salsa dancing is sensual thing, but it wasnt his place to ask.Lily, too, had noticed that Colin had developed feelings for Maria, but remained focused on his dancing lessons.However, shed recommended a restaurant downtown, reminding him twice to make reservations.Shed taught him more about dancing than he thought possible, but he still wasnt entirely confident in his abilities.He didnt want to imagine how unprepared he would have been had she not intervened.After completing his chores, Colin sipped on his second protein drink of the day while he straightened up the apartment, then began working on a paper for his classroom management class.It was only five pages, but he was too distracted to do much more than put together an outline before he finally called it quits.Changing back into his workout clothes, he grabbed his gym bag and headed out the door.Though it had been performing like a champ recently, today the engine coughed and coughed, finally sputtering reluctantly to life, meaning that the problem was neither the ignition switch nor the alternator.He should have been preoccupied with finding a solution, but instead he found himself conjuring up Marias image, strangely anxious that their date go smoothly.Hed called her after work on Thursday and Friday and theyd talked for more than an hour each night, which was a new experience for him.He couldnt remember talking to anyone on the phone that long  ever.Until Maria, he couldnt imagine how anyone sustained such a lengthy conversation.But Maria made it easy, and more than once, he found himself smiling at whatever it was she was saying.She mentioned that Ken had been keeping his distance, and when she recounted the blind date shed been on the night hed changed her tire, hed laughed aloud.After he hung up the phone, hed found it difficult to fall asleep.Ordinarily, he collapsed in bed at the end of the day, unable to keep his eyes open.For the first time in a long while, he considered calling his parents.He wasnt sure why the urge struck him, but he assumed it had something to do with the way Maria talked about her parents and how well they got along.He wondered how different his life might have been had he been brought up in a family like hers.It might not have been any different, of course  hed been a handful even before he could walk  but if family dynamics played even a small role, then his life had taken a direction that wasnt entirely of his making.And though he was satisfied with his current path, the road had until recently been littered with potholes and boulders.That Maria was able to look past those things, considering her own respectable history, was still something of a surprise, though a surprise of the very best kind.Pulling up at the gym, he spotted Maria standing out front.She was dressed in shorts and a T shirt, and he thought again that she was one of the most beautiful women hed ever met.Hey there, she said as he approached.You ready to beat some people up?Its only practice.Youre sure I can go inside to watch?He reached for the door, nodding.I talked to the owner this morning and he was fine with it.And unless you decide to go in the cage, he promised he wouldnt even make you sign a waiver.Youre quite the negotiator.I try, he said.He held the door open, eyeing her figure as she slid past him.He watched as she surveyed her surroundings.Unlike many commercial gyms, this place had more of a warehouse feel.They walked past assorted racks of weights and other cross training equipment, toward the training room at the far end of the building.Passing through another door, he led the way into a roomy space with padded walls and large mats, equipment piled in every corner; over to the left was the cage.A few of Colins training partners were stretching or otherwise warming up, and he nodded toward them as he set down his bag.Maria wrinkled her nose.It smells back here.Its only going to get worse, he promised.Where should I sit?Colin gestured at a bunch of equipment in the corner: crates of boxing gloves, assorted pads, various elastics, jump ropes, and plyometric boxes.You can sit over there on the boxes if youd like, he said.We dont normally use that part of the room.Where will you be?All over, most likely, he said.How many guys will be here?Eight or nine, maybe?Saturdays are always a little slow.During the week, there are fifteen or sixteen of us.In other words, only the supremely dedicated are here?Its more like the workout nuts, or guys who are just starting out and trying to hit every workout they can.On Saturdays, a lot of the serious ones are out of town at events.Thats good.Since were going out, I mean.Id hate for you to end up all cut and bruised like you were the first night I saw you.Are you ever going to let that go?I dont think I can, she said, standing on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek.The image is burned into my brain forever.Colin did a quick warm up; arm rolls and leg swings, a few minutes of jumping rope.By then, Todd Daly, the main instructor and a retired UFC fighter, and Jared Moore, who was fighting professionally but not quite at UFC level, had arrived, and Daly led the entire group through more warm ups.While awaiting his turn in the cage, Colin worked on his ground skills: arm bars and leg locks, various submission holds.Most of the skills had their roots in the martial arts and wrestling, with speed, instinct, and balance being far more important than brute strength.As was usual during Saturday classes, Daly demonstrated the moves first  occasionally using Colin as a partner  before the group split in two.Each group was given a chance to practice the move, repeating it ten or twelve times before switching positions with their partners.They would then move on to a different set of skills.Within ten minutes, Colin was breathing hard; by the half hour mark, his shirt was drenched.Through it all, Daly critiqued them  telling them where to place a foot for additional leverage, or how to wrap more effectively with the legs, the subtle variations endless.One by one, people rotated through the cage, and after an hour, it was Colins turn.He put on headgear and heavier gloves and worked with a partner while Moore  a former Golden Gloves champ from Orlando  shouted coaching tips.Colin went through seven two minute rounds, bouncing and circling, taking advantage of openings to strike or kick while trying to avoid leaving any open shots.He dominated, but less because of his own skill than his opponents lack therof: The guy he faced was out of shape and relatively new, with only a single fight behind him, which hed lost.From there, it was back to the mats again, where they worked on takedowns while their partners back was against the wall; then, switching positions, they tried to prevent takedowns.By the end of class, Colins muscles were twitching with exhaustion.Throughout the afternoon, he found his eyes drifting toward Maria.Hed expected her to be bored, but her gaze followed him the entire time, making the session harder than usual.Ordinarily, focusing exclusively on his opponent was easy, but her presence made him self conscious in a way hed never experienced.In a match, this lack of focus would land him in trouble.By the end of class he felt like hed taken two steps back mentally, and he knew hed have to work hard to regain ground.It was, after all, a sport that was equal parts mental and physical, even if most people didnt realize it.Afterward, he went straight to his bag and tossed in his gear before looping it over his shoulder.By then, Maria had walked up.What did you think?he asked, adjusting the strap.It looked hard.And tiring.And sweaty.Thats about it, when you get right down to it.How do you think it went?Okay, he said.I got distracted.By me?Yes.Im sorry.Dont be.He smiled before tugging at his shirt.Could you give me a few minutes to rinse off and change?I need to get out of these things or my car seat will be soaked by the time I get home.Maria wrinkled her nose.Thats kind of gross to think about.Is that a yes or a no?By all means, she said.Ill wait out front for you.When Colin finally exited the locker room, he spotted Maria just outside the doors, talking on the phone.In her sunglasses, she resembled a glamorous fifties era movie star.She hung up just as he approached.That was Serena.Is she all right?Shes having dinner at the house tonight with the director of some scholarship thing, so shes a bit nervous, but other than that, shes okay.She shrugged.Do you feel better?I feel cleaner.Temporarily, anyway.Im still sweating.She touched his arm.Im glad I came.It was a lot more interesting than I thought it would be.Are we still on for seven thirty?I hope so, she said.And just to warn you, when we go dancing, I might be a little rusty.I wouldnt worry.Itll be my first time ever.And Maria?Yes?Thanks for coming today.It meant a lot to me.As soon as Colin got out of his car, Evan stepped onto the porch holding a plastic shopping bag.Here, he said, holding the bag out.This is for you.And you owe me some money.Colin stopped in front of the porch.For what?Lily thought you might need something to wear tonight.I have clothes.Dont blame me.I said exactly the same thing to her.But shes Lily, and she dragged me through the stores anyway, and like I said, you owe me some money.The receipt is in the bag.What did she buy?Its actually not as bad as it could have been.I had visions of her selecting something with tassels or bells or whatever, but she didnt.Its black slacks, a red button down shirt, and black shoes.How did she know my size?
