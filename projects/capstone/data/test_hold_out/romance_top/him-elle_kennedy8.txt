Cue his sons involvement.Dad!the kid shouts.What the hell are you saying?Pats jaw hardens until it resembles a granite block.Youll need to follow me, sir.If youre going to slander my NHL bound coaching staff, you can do it in the privacy of my office.He turns around and disappears into the building.I wait until Killfucker passes me.On his way up the steps he gives me an evil glare.Then I follow him inside.Right behind me is Jamie, his eyes downcast.Im going to hear what he has to say, I whisper.But you dont have to come.Jamie gives me an exasperated glance and follows me anyway.Fuck me sideways.Ive just fucked up Jamies final summer at Elites.This job he loves so much?Torpedoed by yours truly.Hes going to rue the day he ever met me.A minute later, the four of us gather in Pats tiny office, and I flick the door shut.Killfucker obviously knows not to hesitate before taking a shot.He lets it fly before Pat can speak first.Dont try to tell me you dont know about these two.How the fuck could you hire them to work with impressionable teenagers?Pat takes a deep breath, but his face is red.I have no idea whats set you off.Does someone want to fill me in?Jamie opens his mouth to speak, but I hold up a hand.I can feel myself shaking with anger, but my voice sounds reasonably steady.Lets let Mr.Killfeather tell Coach Pat exactly what he saw.I turn to Killfucker.And dont hold back, man.Tell him every detail.This parry works, because Killfucker starts to look uncomfortable.Ive just managed to use his own homophobia against him.He cant even get the words out, hes so disgusted.They He clears his throat and points at me.He kissed him.And now I have to give Pat credit.Theres a flash of surprise on his face, but he shuts it down only a nanosecond later.I jump in again before Pat has a chance.Thats not a good enough description, man.What else did you see?Im waiting to hear the perversion.Killfucker shakes his head.That was plenty, trust me.Really?I snarl.Where did I kiss Coach Canning?Hes clearly finding my offensive play exasperating, so I know Im on the right track.At the gas station!On what part of his body, dude?Then I almost snicker, because now theres a throbbing vein in the center of Killfuckers forehead.Uh, here, he says, pointing at his cheek.But thats not the point.I keep pushing.Really?Because I think it is exactly the point.Ive known Jamie forever, and hed just told me something important about his career, and I hugged him.With one arm.Dont skimp on the details, okay?I comforted my friend in all that gory detailhalf a hug and a kiss on the cheek.Slap the cuffs on me, why dont you?I put my wrists out straight.Killfucker is about to explode.But I saw...I think you two clearly  Pat jumps in now.It really doesnt matter what you think.This is your big problem?A G rated private moment between friends?Friends who  Not your business!Pat shouts him down.Not mine, either.Ive never seen my coaches do anything inappropriate.They are all business on that rink.And thats what youre paying for, sir.No!counters Killfucker.Im paying for good judgment, and I will tell whoever is willing to listen that you dont screen your employees.Youre just waiting for disaster, anyway.These two cause a stir and  Pat cuts him off.The only stir Coach Canning caused was the day his girlfriend showed up at the rink.And your son made an inappropriate comment about her anatomy.Killfuckers mouth falls open.Then its worse than you know, Coach, because Mr.Canning here obviously gets around.Because I know what I saw.And my son and I are out of here.Shit.Poor Killfeather.Hes got this ass for a dad, and he gets yanked from camp?Pats face is a stone.Youre free to do as you wish.But if you slander my coaches to anyone I will not take it lying down.Not like they do, huh?After issuing this parting shot, Killfucker leaves.The office is left in a deafening silence.The only sound is Pats loud sigh, until Jamie tries to say something.Coach, I  Pat holds up a hand.Just give me a minute to think.Chastened, Jamie is silent again.He doesnt glance at me, though, and I wish he would.Okay, Coach says.You two can head back to your room, Ill text you when its clear how this jackass is going to play it.And I want to apologize, Jamie, for bringing up that bit about your female friend  Not necessary, he says quickly.But Pat is shaking his head.No.It shouldnt matter!I dont give two fucks if you have a girlfriend or not.But I let him get me flustered.The fact that the situation took me by complete surprise only means youve both behaved impeccably.Now thats not true.Good thing Coach Pat doesnt follow us around when were skinny dipping and fucking in the car.Ive run this camp for twenty years, he adds, looking us each in the eye in turn.There have been times when Ive had to ask staff to be more discreet.But that is not the case here.And now Jamie is the color of a tomato.He looks like hed happily activate any trapdoors in Pats office floor.My fists finally unclench.Pat?I apologize if Im making your day more complicated, but Im not going upstairs to wait for your text.Were supposed to be scrimmaging, right?I dont run.My private life is my business.Not many people know my secret.But if some asshole decides to confront me, I never duck him.That only looks weak.I have every right to be here.I have every right to coach those kids.Pat squeezes the bridge of his nose.Of course you do.I was just trying to shield you from any more ignorant bullshit.Get your skates on, then.Fuck im.30      Jamie      Maybe it makes me a pussy, but I take Pat up on his offer to sit this scrimmage out.Im not afraid of Killfeathers dad.And Im not afraid to have people whisper about me.But what I am is sad.And I dont want it to show.Before today I didnt really understand what Wes was up against.Id never heard anyone give a homophobic rant except in movies.I didnt know that one man in a hundred thousand dollar car could wreak so much havoc.Since everyone is supposed to be at the rink, the second floor of the dormitory sounds deserted as I turn my key in our lock.Inside, I stretch out on my bed.Sad as I am, I can at least take one heart lifting thing from this experience.One piece of insight Ive been reluctant to give a label to.Imbisexual.Yep, I know, not exactly a mind blowing M.  Night Shyamalan plot twist over here, but its the first time Ive allowed the word to take root in my consciousness.Im bisexual, and its not just a physical connection I feel with Wes.I can also see myself in a relationship with him.I can see myself being happy with him and never feeling like things were lacking.Id had this idea I could find a job near Toronto.That Wes and I could keep up whatever it is we are to each other.But that isnt going to happen.Wes all but told me to go to Detroit.He needs me to stay four hours away.We only have the summer, hed said the night we argued.He was right.Thats all were going to get.Some time later I hear a commotion out in the hallway.The place echoes, so even though Killfeathers room is on the opposite end of the building its easy to hear him.I dont want to leave!he yells after a door bangs open.You will get your ass in my car right now.You cant make me!The kid is putting his best effort into the resistance.But I know very well who always wins these fights.The voice that answers him is low and steely.If youre not in that car in sixty seconds, youre not playing in the Labor Day tournament this year.Ouch.Hit the kid where it hurts, why dont you?I hear the inevitablethe sound of a suitcase rolling across the tile and feet on the stairs.When I look out the window a minute later, I see my goalie slouching toward the passenger seat, and his father heaving suitcases into the trunk.That asshole didnt even get a ticket for parking in the fire lane.They peel off a minute later, and thats the end of the Killfeathers, both junior and senior.I blow off the barbecue, too.Since Ive missed the scrimmage, Pat doesnt really need me, and I use the time to regroup.I need to face the fact that summer will end soon.So I call my mom on her business phonethe one thats always smudged with clay.Hi baby!she chirps when she answers.Are you calling to tell me that youre coming home?The woman always cuts to the chase.With six kids, shes always had to.There just arent enough hours in the day for small talk.I am, as a matter of fact.Coach Pat hasnt replaced me yet, but Im going to tell him I need that week off.Excellent, she says in the same tone of voice shed always reserved for good report cards.We need to see you before you join the NHL.While you still have all your teeth.Thats uplifting, I complain.I dont know why my boys choose dangerous careers, she says.I always tell your brother to make sure he visits while he still has all his vital organs.My brother is a cop.Gross, mom.And Scott has never drawn his weapon in the line of duty.Truthfully, bullets arent his biggest problem right now.She fills me in on the fact my brother has moved back home for a little while.Hes the one whose girlfriend recently dumped him.And since they lived together, he needed a temporary place to land.So hes in his old room?I ask, trying to picture it.Scott is twenty eight years old.He is, but rarely.Hes picked up a lot of extra shifts lately.I think hes just trying to stay busy.Ouch, I mumble.James, my mother says sharply.Why are you blue?Im not, I try.But bullshitting my mother is impossible.You dont raise six kids without having laser sharp perceptive abilities.She clucks her tongue.If you say so.But Ill be taking a good look at you later this month, young man.Im going to make lasagna and hold it under your nose while I grill you with questions.Moms lasagna is damn good.Ill probably confess everything if she does that.Cant wait, I say truthfully.Home sounds pretty good right now.Love you, Jamie boy, she says.Buy your plane ticket.I will.Talking to Mom has improved my mood.So I go out and treat myself to a bacon cheeseburger in a bar on Main Street.While I eat it, I watch the Red Sox lose, and think of Wes.Hes at the barbecue right now, where parents are probably grilling him about the NHL recruitment process.And hes the best man to answer their questions.Thats not me broodingthats just a fact.Wes has always wanted to play in the NHL.Its the first thing he told me about himself when we met as teenagers.Me?I chose hockey because my brothers had already broken every football record our high school had ever recorded.I love hockey.But you cant ever say I love it more than Wes does.Because nobody loves hockey more.When I get back to the dorm, the place is still empty.I brush my teeth and dig out a military thriller Id brought with me to camp and havent had time to read.I slide into bed in my underwear.Maybe Wes will come home in the mood to burn off some tension.I fall asleep with the book on my chest.Some time later I wake to the sound of the key turning in the lock.Bleary, I blink at Wes as he walks over to my bed.How was it?I ask, my voice rough from sleep.Wes doesnt answer me.But he removes the book and sets it on the floor.You okay?Hes still silent, but it doesnt seem weird.Because hes perched on the side of my bed now, just admiring me.Lifting one hand, he pushes my overgrown hair off my forehead.Then he bends down and kisses the cheek that had caused all the trouble earlier.In the exact same spot.The brush of his lips makes me shiver and lean in for more.Soft lips continue to press kisses on my face.On my neck.Their gentleness feels unfamiliar to me now.And the contrast between the size and strength of this man and the softness of his touch makes goosebumps rise on my chest.A warm hand lands on the juncture between my legs, settling over the thin fabric of my underwear.The gentle pressure encourages me to roll my hips into his hand.A little friction would feel terrific right now.But all I get is the soft sweep of his thumb across my groin.Apparently Wes is in the mood to torture me with kindness.And Im in the mood to let him.Sinking into the bed, I close my eyes while he bathes me with soft kisses and even softer touches.When I reach up to put my hands on his chest, he corrects me, gently moving my hands back down onto the mattress.Fine.Be that way, I grumble.He doesnt even chuckle.Instead, he clicks off my lamp and begins to shed his clothing.Every scrap.I lie there on my back while my eyes grow accustomed to the dark, admiring each newly exposed inch of smooth skin and hard muscle.An impressive erection bobs against his stomach.I want to sit up and take him in my mouth, but I wait lazily instead.Whatever Wes has planned, Im pretty sure Im going to enjoy it.Then hes bending over me, kissing the strip of exposed skin between my T shirt and my briefs.Mmm, I sigh.Im so hard, and he hasnt really even touched me yet.His hands slide into the elastic of my shorts and I lift my hips.Whoosh, theyre gone.The next second, he puts a hand across my mouth and then deep throats my cock in one gulp.The heat and pressure are so swift and shocking its a miracle I dont bite his hand.Wes works me over with his eager mouth, while my stomach quivers and my hips roll.Jesus Christ.I know we have to be absolutely silent, but I may not survive it.By the time he releases me with a pop, Im trembling everywhere.Wes disappears from my line of vision for a moment.When he returns with a condom and a bottle of lube, I sigh with relief.He offers me a hand, and I take it, allowing him to pull me into a sitting position so he can remove my T shirt.Then he straddles my thighs, crouching there on his knees.For the first time since he walked into the room, were kissing for real.And Im so hungry for it.All the softness from a few minutes ago burns off like steam, leaving a brush fire in its wake.These kisses are hard and molten.I capture Wess tongue in my mouth and suck hard.He moansthe first real sound Ive heard from him tonightand I swallow the sound down my eager throat.On his knees, he ruts slowly against my body, our chests bumping, our cocks aching.Wanting him hurts so good.Eventually he sits back a bit, breaking our kiss.I reach for the condom, hoping to move things along.But he takes it out of my hand, tearing the package.Instead of sheathing himself, he reaches down and rolls it onto my cock.The breath halts in my chest.Really?Wes kisses me instead of answering.Another tongue tangling scorcher.Then he pops open the lube and applies some to his own hand.He reaches back, a serious expression on his face.I can tell when he penetrates himself, because he bites his lip.Let me do that for you, I whisper.I lube up my hand and reach between his legs.Wes puts both fists on the bed and leans into my body, kissing my jaw.I caress his taint, and he sighs into my ear.When I finger his crease, he lays his head on my shoulder.Thats it, I breathe.When I penetrate him, he freezes for a second.Then I hear him take a deep breath, and I feel him relax.Hes hot and tight and like nothing Ive ever felt.I ease inside.He alternately fights me and then relaxes.I stop to apply a ridiculous amount of lube to my hand.And now Im able to reach his spot.I move my finger in a beckoning motion, and he shivers against my body.Wess face is still buried in my neck.I like it there.I wish hed never leave.31      Wes      Im struggling.Thats the theme of today, apparently: flat out struggle.But this is a struggle Ive chosen.Letting another man into my body isnt easy for me.I dont know why.It just isnt.I want to, though.Every time I tense up against the intrusion, I tell myself the same thing: this is Jamie.Its okay.And then Im able to relax.Jamies taking it slowly.He reads me in the way a talented goalie would.Hes firm and gentle in this as in all other things.Fuck.I love him so much.Today was another reminder of the way things are.The first time I ever touched Jamie, I pretended to be giving him something when in truth I was taking.He forgave me, of course.Unfortunately, this summer has been more of the same.I give him my affection.And in return, I put him at the mercy of assholes like Killfucker.Today Jamie lost his star player.Hell probably never see that kid again.And its all my fault.Jamies free hand warms my back while his other one preps me.Baby, he whispers.Can you take more?I nod into his neck.A second finger joins the first one.At first I struggle against the burn.Its Jamie.Its okay.Another deep breath and I make myself relax.Thats it, he urges.I want you to ride me, okay?And when you come, I want you to shoot all over my chest.A bolt of lust races down my spine.I bear down on his fingers, and Im rewarded with a brush against my prostate.Yes.That zing of pleasure makes me shiver, and I can feel Jamies smile against my cheek.After a few minutes, he gets me to three fingers.I start riding his hand in small thrusts.He murmurs encouragement while I ask my body for a little more stretch.Its been years since I tried this.I was hoping it would just seem easy, but like everything else in my life, I have to work for it.But I do it.And it leaves me with yet another reason to appreciate Jamie.My daring, big hearted man.He does this for me, and he makes it look easy.Hes amazing.I sit up a little straighter, kissing him hard to let him know Im ready.Jamies mouth welcomes me in.I take a few more exquisite sips of him.For courage.Then I rise up on my knees, readying myself for him.Jamie settles himself so hes propped up on the headboard, pillows at his back.He applies some lube to his cock, and the sight of him rubbing himself makes my mouth water.He positions himself beneath me.Right then, with those brown eyes looking up, full of lust for me, hes the sexiest thing Ive ever seen.So I do it.I sink down onto his dick.Jamies mouth opens on a silent groan, and those beautiful eyes go half mast.The burn returns, but its nothing I cant handle.I give myself a minute to adjust, and I use the time to take Jamies gorgeous face in my hands.For a second I just admire the view.Hes flushed and sex tousled, burning up with arousal.I came to Lake Placid hoping we could still be friends.I got much more than that.And Im so grateful.The kiss I give him tries to let him know that.Hes almost whimpering into my mouth now, so maybe he hears me.I give my hips an experimental thrust, and I like the results.So I brace my hands on Jamies shoulders and begin to slowly fuck myself on him.I shift my hips until I get the angle just right.And when I do, its miraculous.Pleasure pulses through my body each time I thrust.Its so, so good.Beneath me, Jamie takes my weeping cock in hand.His lips are parted, his throat working.I see yearning anywhere I look at him.Its in the set of his jaw and in the ripple of his forearm while he jacks me.He licks his lips.If you come, youll take me with you.Now that hes said it, I really want to.Closing my eyes, I slow my pace and focus on the pleasure of each stroke.Out and in blur together.Theres only the ruffle of bliss I get from him.When I open my eyes again, its Jamies expression that finally takes me there.Its a cocktail of desire and wonder so potent that I feel myself tip over the edge.Jamie, I gasp, chasing the sensation.Leaning into it.I shoot and he shudders beneath me.I collapse on his messy chest before its over.My lips land beside his ear and I moan quietly while my ass clenches around his cock.Jesus, he whispers.Indeed.I wrap my arms around him and hold on for as long as I dare.I honestly dont know how Im ever going to give him up when summer comes to an end.32      Jamie      Camp is almost over.Seriously, these past five weeks have flown by.And now theres one week left and I cant wrap my brain around it.I guess time flies when youre playing hockey every day and getting laid every night.As the afternoon scrimmage winds down, the kids are in high spirits.Correctionthe offensive players are in high spirits.My goalies, on the other hand, are grumpy as hell.It was a high scoring game for both sides, and there was no stopping Wess forwards today.Killfeathers absence is definitely noticeable.He had real talent.Has, I correct myself, because its not like the kid dropped dead.His gay bashing father decided that pulling his son from one of the most prestigious training facilities in the country was a smart move.You know, because Elites is crawling with perverts.Moron.I skate over to the net, where my fifteen year old goalie lingers, scowling as he removes his helmet.I was dog shit today, Brighton informs me.You had an off day, I say with a smile.But you werent dog shit.You stopped more than you let in.I let in seven.It happens, kid.You did everything right out there.Im not lyingBrighton heeded every piece of advice I gave him today.Just happened that Wess advice to his forwards was better.I blow my whistle to signal my other goalie, who looks equally glum as he skates over to us.I played like  Let me guess, dog shit?I cut in, grinning at Bradowski.Yeah, Brighton and I just went over that.But you guys played hard today, and you played well.I dont want you going back to the dorm and sulking all night, okay?Okay, they say in unison, but it doesnt sound too convincing.I sigh.Look at it this way.Brighton, you let in seven out of I call out to Georgie as he skates by us.How many shots did Wess boys take on net?Thirty five, Georgie calls back without stopping.Seven out of thirty five, I tell Brighton.I do some quick math.Thats twenty percent.And Bradowski, you had eight get by you, but stopped about as many as Brighton.Its not a terrible statistic.I chuckle.Coach Wesley and I used to challenge each other to shootouts all the time when we were training here.There were days when hed slap five shots at me and every single one would hit its mark.Wess ears must be burning, because he suddenly appears beside me.Everything okay here?Yep.Just telling the boys about how you used to smoke my ass in shootouts.When his brows shoot up, I realize hes thinking about the last time we faced off.Awesome.Now Im thinking about it too, and I hope to God the kids dont see the blush on my cheeks.Yeah, Canning didnt stand a chance against me, Wes says, recovering quickly.On either side of the goal, actually.Didnt matter if I was holding the stick or wearing the goalie padshe lost every time.I narrow my eyes.Bullshuh, bullcrap.Are you forgetting who won the last one?I have to give Wes credithe doesnt even blink this time, even though we both know hes remembering the outcome of that last shootout.The boys snicker.Rematch, Brighton blurts out.Bradowskis eyes light up.Shit!Yes!Wes and I exchange a look.We should really be hustling the kids into the showers so theyre not late for dinner, but the boys arent having it.Bradowski and Brighton are already whizzing away, calling out to the teenagers who havent made it to the tunnel yet.Coach Canning and Coach Wesley are having a shootout!Well, then.I guess its time for a shootout.Wes winks at me and says, Same stakes?Damn straight.We both grin at my choice of words.Ten minutes later, were suited up and getting in position.Our audience has growneven the coaches are gathered around the boards, Pat included.Im wearing full pads, because no way am I leaving myself unprotected while Torontos new forward fires bullets at me.Wes shows off his flashy moves as he skates toward the blue line, then stops and looks right at me.The wicked gleam in his eyes makes my pulse race.I can practically hear his unspoken tauntget ready to suck my dick, Canning.I take a breath and tap my stick against the ice.A whistle blows, and then Wes comes barreling toward me.One lightning fast slapshot, and a loud cheer echoes in the rink.Goal.Shit.Hes not pulling any punches today.I brush it off and focus, defending against his next two shots and drawing my own cheers from the crowd.Wes grins at me as he lines up the next puck.Ready for this?The asshole has just repeated the same words hed said to me last night right before hed shoved his cock in my ass.All about the mind games, my boyfriend.Wait, what?The puck flies past me and I dont even stand a chance, because my brain is still tripping over that last thought.My boyfriend?I thought Id resigned myself to the fact that we werent going to be together.And now Im thinking of him as my boyfriend?I shrug the cobwebs from my head and force myself to concentrate on defending the net.When my glove swallows up the last puck, I breathe in relief.I only let in two.Which means I need to score on him twice to tie, three for the win.Considering hes nowhere near as good as me in the crease, I can already taste the victory.But he looks way too comfortable in front of that net.His gray eyes mock me behind the mask, and when he calls out, Show me what youve got, theres laughter in his voice.Cocky bastard thinks he can actually stop me.Fuck.The cocky bastard does stop me.My first shot lands in his glove.I grit my teeth and try to deke him out with the second attempt, but his hawk like gaze isnt fooled.He stops this one with his pads, the next one with his stick.Shit.I need to sink the next two to tie.The kids whoop in delight when my fourth attempt proves fruitful.It flies past Wess shoulder and hits the net.Last shot, he says in a singsong voice.Youre totally gonna blow it, Canning!I know exactly what kind of blowing hes talking about.Brighton gets a drum roll going by tapping his hands on the boards, and the other kids quickly follow suit.The beat matches the steady thumping of my heart.I take a breath, then skate forward.I pull my arm back, assess, and release a slapshot.The puck hisses in the air.I miss.The kids go nuts as Wes leaves the net and skates up and down the boards to accept their high fives.I watch him in suspicion, wondering when hed gotten so good at defending against the puck.Four years ago hed been totally inept.Shrugging the thought away, I accept my condolences from my goalies, who actually look kinda pleased I lost.I guess it made them realize even the best goaltenders suck sometimes.As the kids file toward the locker rooms, Wes skates his way over to me and raises one eyebrow.Youre either slacking on your shooting drills, or you let me win that.Didnt let you win, I say through clenched teeth.Except then a thought occurs to me.That last shootout before college had he let me win?Because the guy I saw in the net today was not the one I saw there four years ago  Im about to ask him point blank when Pat interrupts us.Canning, he says, appearing near the bench.A word.Wes claps a hand over my shoulder.Ill see you in the dining hall.We skate off in opposite directions, but Pat doesnt speak until Wes is well out of earshot.I got a call from a friend in Toronto this morning.As usual, Pat gets right to the point.I tense up.About the possibility of me coaching?He nods.My buddys name is Rodney Davenport.Hes with the OHL, coaches one of the Junior A teams in the league.Hes in Ottawa, but hes tight with the head coach of the Toronto teamBill Braddock.He spoke to Braddock on your behalf.Surprise jolts through me.He did?I told Davenport all about you.Vouched for you.Pat shrugs.Youve got an interview in Toronto on the twenty eighth.I do?Im dumbfounded.A part of me hadnt expected Pat to actually come through for me.Its an assistant coach position, defensive coordinator for a major juniors team, so youd be working with kids ages sixteen to twenty.The interview is just a formality, though.The league was highly impressed with your level of experience.Well, goddamn.I guess all those years of coaching here at Elites are coming in handy.I I dont know what to say.But then I realize theres an important question to address.If Im in Toronto with I clear my throat.Im not ashamed; its just that Ive never had any practice talking about this.What if there are other men like Mr.Killfeather?Pat yanks a piece of paper from his shirt pocket.This is the leagues anti discrimination policy.I looked it up.Everything is, uh, covered.I skim the words on the page.The league has pledged not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, creed or sexual orientation.Thatshelpful, I say, and Pat grins.July twenty eighth, huh?Shit.Thats next week, and three days before I report to Detroit.If I report to Detroit.The thought of showing up at training camp grows less and less appealing the closer it gets to the date.Do I want to play in the pros?Or do I want to help young, talented kids get to the pros?Braddock needs an answer by the end of the week, Pat tells me.They had another candidate they were considering, so if you decide not to interview for the gig, theyll most likely give it to him.My mind is still reeling, indecision surging through me.I should really talk to Wes before I do anything.He made it more than clear he wont be dating anyone when hes in Toronto.He told me to go to Detroit.So yeah, I need to talk to him before I make any decisions.But I have a sinking feeling I know exactly what hes going to say.33      Wes      Canning is acting weird.He barely said a word during dinner, and then he vetoed my suggestion about catching a movie in town, saying he just wanted to go back to the room.As we climb the dormitory steps in silence, I wish I knew what was going on in that sexy head of his.He doesnt seem angry, or even upset.More like worried, which is so unlike Jamie it worries me.So what did Pat want to talk to you about earlier?Im trying to make conversation, but my question has the opposite effect.Just some coaching stuff, he answers.And then he clams up again.I smother a sigh and follow him up to the second floor, admiring the way his faded jeans hug his ass.Weve been in shorts and flip flops all summer, but its surprisingly cool out tonight, so now I get to experience Jamie in jeans.He looks fucking spectacular.Wanna watch something on your laptop?I ask as I enter our room.Cassel sent me this hilarious video of  His lips are on mine before I can finish that sentence.Jamie pushes me up against the door and jams his tongue in my mouth, and I instinctively kiss him back despite the WTF bells going off in my head.He grips my waist and grinds his lower body against mine, groaning roughly.Jesus Christ.Im not sure where this sudden onslaught of passion came from, but my dick sure appreciates it.After a minute or two, Im an iron spike behind my zipper.Jamie notices, and his hands are almost frantic as he fumbles for the button of my jeans.Owe you a blowjob, he mumbles.Right.The shootout.Id forgotten about the prize.Not that it matters, seeing as we blow each other regularly without needing a shootout to justify it.He tugs my pants and boxers down my hips, sinking to his knees with damn near desperation.The alarms in my head blare louder.Hey.I thread my fingers through his hair to still his frenzied movements.Whats gotten into you?Nothing yet.He licks the head of my cock, and I see stars.But Im hoping this will get into me pretty soon.Then he takes my entire length in his mouth, proving without a doubt hes picked up a few new tricks this summer.He can deep throat like a champ now, and normally Im all over that.Tonight, something feels off.His urgency thickens the air.I lean back against our door and try to give myself over to him, but in spite of his magic mouth, I cant quite focus.Slipping a hand under his chin, I urge him upward.Come here.Jamie gives one more good suck, which I feel down to my toes.When he stands, I turn us around so his back is to the door.Cupping his chin in both hands, I examine his gorgeous face.His cheeks are flushed, and his big brown eyes are full of some emotion I cant quite read.Im going to find out whats up, but first I kiss him.Once.Twice.Canning, I whisper.We dont fuck until you tell me whats on your mind.His eyes drop.I might coach next year, he says, his voice hoarse.Really?Thats an idea I didnt know hed considered.Depending on the job, it might be an interesting solution to his goalie woes.Though a part of me still thinks hed be nuts to throw away a professional hockey career.Where?Theres a defensive coordinator job for a major junior team He swallows.In Toronto.In Toronto.The words ricochet through my mind.For the briefest of seconds, my heart takes off like a rocket.I might have gotten around to giving a whoop of inappropriate glee, except Im still staring into Jamies wary eyes.Hes always been the smarter of the two of us.But Im a quick study.So its only a half second later when my chest tightens, and my hands slip from his face.He actually flinches when they fall away.I cant be with Jamie in Toronto.Because if were found out, there wont be any reason for me to be in that city at all.Im a fucking rookie, hoping to be lucky enough to make myself valuable to the team.Another few seconds go by before I can bring myself to point this out to him.Because its Jamie Canning were talking about here.The odds of me ever loving anyone else like I love him are about as good as being attacked by a shark.In Toronto.But Jamies odds of moving on are exponentially better.Weve had a lot of fun this summer, but it cant possibly mean to him what it means to me.This beautiful man is probably more straight than not.And even if Im wrong about that, there are now twice as many available partners for him on the planet than there were six weeks ago.He can have anyone.And I wont ask him to wait around for me.Say something, he mutters.I dont want to.Theres heat behind my eyes, and my throat might crack.But I wont pussy out.He deserves my honesty for once.We cant be together in Toronto, I say.Just six little words.But they make his eyes turn red.Im sorry, I add.Sorry doesnt even begin to describe it.He sidesteps me, moving away from the door.I take a moment to tuck myself back into my jeans.By the time Ive done up my zipper, Jamie has made a frantic change into a pair of running shorts.He stuffs his feet into his shoes, not even taking the time to lace them.Going for a run, he grunts.When he moves for the door, I move out of the way.Its precisely the opposite maneuver than I want to perform, and my heart is screaming at me to call him back.But the door opens and shuts again with a snap, and hes gone.Panicking now, I hurry over to our window.A minute later he bursts off the front porch and goes running down the street, shoelaces still trailing behind him.Even after hes out of view, I need a minute of calm breathing to compose myself.I cant believe I just did that.Its not what I want.My thoughts zip around like a pinball while I search my brain for a solution to the problem.But there isnt one.Ive just spent a decade of my life trying to get this job in Toronto.I have a college degree in communications, like every other fucking jock on the planet.And a father who will have me tarred and feathered if I fuck up in Toronto.Jamie Canning was my first crush and my first love.But he was never mine to have.Theres one silver lining here.Just one.I know Jamies pissed right now because hes feeling rejected.Thats never fun.But I know in my gut hell move on.The Hollys of the world are waiting to take him back.Some cute girl will catch his eye before the week is through, and a few months from now, todays disaster will be just a bad memory.As will I.   I swallow that thought down, then look on the closet floor for my suitcase.34      Jamie      Its Sunday dinner at my parents house in San Rafael, California.This time Im not seeing it on SkypeIm prepping the pasta course myself.Ive minced a mountain of garlic, diced several onions and chopped a mountain of olives.Well be ten for dinner tonightthe eight of us plus Tammys husband and Jesss new boyfriend.Mom has had me in the kitchen for an hour and a half, and were nowhere near ready.As it happens, cooking is very therapeutic.Ive got something to do with my hands, and I dont have to look anyone in the eye.Ive been home for forty eight hours, and Mom is circling like a shark.She knows something is seriously wrong with me.All Ive told her is that Im having a career crisis.She knows about the interview scheduled three days from now, which conflicts with the fact that Im supposed to be in Detroit six days from now.Everything Ive told her is true.But its not all the truth.Choosing between two career paths is big stuff, but its not nearly as painful as what Wes has done to me.After that awful scene in our room, I went out to run.Three miles later, Wes was gone.I dont mean gone out for a drinkhe was gone from camp.All his clothing had disappeared from our closet.His toiletries were gone.His skates were gone.I knew without asking that he wasnt coming back.When I went down to breakfast the next morning, Pats face was full of sympathy.And when I asked Pat if he was sure he had enough coaches on hand the following week for me to take off for Cali, he said yes without even an argument.Ive spent the last two days trying not to mope around my room.Coincidentally, my parents garden is well weeded.Ive lost to my father at chess four times.And I finally finished that book Id brought to camp.But I just ache from the loss of my best friend / boyfriend / whatever.We never did get around to putting a label on it.And now we never will.Fuck!I curse as the paring knife slices the top of my finger.The knife slips from my hand when I pinch the cut closed.James.My mothers voice is gentle.Maybe you need a break.She doesnt even complain about the F bomb I just dropped.So I must be acting like a real head case.Let me find you a bandage, she says instead.Two minutes later shes covered the wound.I can saut one handed, I offer.How about you tell me whats bothering you instead?Now, I could do that.My parents wouldnt flinch at the idea of me being involved with a man.Theyre both California hippies all the way to the core.And if Wes and I had stayed together, Id share it in a heartbeat.But theres no point in telling the story now.Id just be buying myself a lifetime of teasing from my siblings.(You need to know which shirt goes with those pants?Ask Jamie.He was gay once for a few weeks. )You cant just give five siblings that kind of ammo unless its relevant.And anyway, Im saved from answering my mothers questions, because the kitchen door bangs open as the first wave begins to arrive.Jamester!my sister Tammy yells.Here.Hold this.Before I can argue, theres a toddler in my arms.Fresh meat!my sister cackles.And her husband slips past us both to get himself a beer.I look down at the baby.Um, hi, I say to Ty.I havent seen him in two months, and I swear hes doubled in size.Hah, he answers around the four fingers hes got jammed in his mouth.Then he removes his drooly little hand and uses it to grab my nose.The size of Tammys smile doubles.Good to have you back, kid.Tammy is thirty, but shes been calling me kid since she was twelve and I was four.Ty and I fetch a beer from the refrigerator and head out to the deck where theres a sweeping view of the San Rafael bay in the distance.My parents bought this house thirty four years ago before Joe was born.Thats the only reason they can afford this sweet view in a great neighborhood.The house itself received two half hearted additions as the family grew.We call it the Hodge Podge Lodge.In its current configuration, there are five bedrooms.As the youngest, I had my own room in this house for exactly one year before leaving for college.My life was a series of bunk beds, fights over the best flavored cereals, and loud family meals.I fucking love it here.I think I need to add a third thing to the list, I tell Ty.When I look down at him, hes staring back with wide brown eyes that are not unlike my own.Detroit, Toronto or California?I ask him.Ty scrunches up his face and appears to consider the question.Hes thinking about it hard.But then theres a small gassy sound.His face relaxes just as I begin to smell something foul.Did you just take a crap on my watch?I ask the baby.He gazes back, all innocence.There he is!Jamie!I spin around to find my other sister, Jess.And before she can react, Ive walked over and handed her the baby.Then I give her a big kiss on the cheek.Good to see you, sis.Did you just hand me a poopy nephew?Is that what that smell is?You!Jess sputters.She and I are the youngest of the family.Shes twenty five, and the sibling I feel closest to.Which means we drive each other insane.No backsies, I add.She rolls her eyes.Fine.Ill go find the diaper bag.Get a beer for Raven, would you?Do something useful.She leaves the deck, walking past a man Ive never seen before.Youre Did she say Raven?What the hell kind of name is that?Raven, he says, and he holds out a fist for me to bump.Seriously?I bump it, so as not to be rude.Youre the hockey player, he says.His voice is kind of smoky, I realize.Sure, I reply noncommittally.Because who the hell knows what Ill decide to do by the end of the week.Cool, he says, sounding rather stoned.My sister sure can pick em.But when Raven puts his hip against the deck railing and crosses his arms, I notice the tats peeking out from the sleeves of his T shirt and the curve of his bicep.Not bad.Jesus Christnow Im checking out my sisters boyfriend.Argh!Fuck you, Ryan Wesley.You see what you made me do?But thats a ridiculous thought, and now I have the sudden urge to laugh like a hyena.You, I choke back a laugh, want a beer?Sure, he grunts.Hes a real talker, our Raven.If Wes were here hed  Right.Sigh.Dinner is loud and fun, the way its always been.Listening to my brothers smack talk, I forget about Wes for a couple of hours at least.We got one professional athlete in the family, Scotty whines, and he wastes it on hockey.Its not too late, his twin Brady argues.Jamie could take up football.The Niners need defense, too.Ive got it all figured out, my dad announces.Jamies team plays Anaheim in November...My stomach drops, because theres almost no chance he would see me play in that game.Which means we could all go to a Niners game together!my father finishes.Typical.At least if I do give up on the NHL, nobody will be too upset.We tease Tammy about her round belly.And we tease Joe about his thinning hair.And when its my turn to be teased, I hardly even hear it.The day flies by in a whirl of gossip and taunts.Now the dishes are done and the peach pie is eaten up.Most of the clan has gone home, and its down to me, my parents, Brady, and Scotty, who is staying here right now.Were on the deck again, feet up on the railing, watching the sun go down as Scotty tells me his tale of woe.She said, I dont want to be married to a cop.Andhonest to GodI tried to figure out how not to be one.I have a degree in criminal justice and seven years of work experience.And I seriously thought of chucking it.My brothers voice is rough, and I feel a hell of a lot more than a simple pang of sympathy.But then I realized that it probably wouldnt matter.If she loved me, the job wouldnt matter.But she didnt.Not enough anyway.Okay, check, please.Theres a small but statistically significant chance Im going to be crying into my beer in a minute.And wont that be fun to explain?At least I know I did everything I could, he adds.I told her that I loved her, that I wanted the real deal.I made my case, and I made it strong.So I have no regrets.Fuck.Its not like I can say the same thing.Wes pushed me away, and what did I do?I went for a run.I let him sneak off like a thief in the night.I didnt say, I love you.I did not say it.Instead, I just choked it back.I am a moron.Jamie?my mother says gently.What?I croak.You okay over there?Where do mothers get that ability?Its so fucking inconvenient.Im fine, I mutter, convincing nobody.Whoever she is, honey If she matters to you, I hope youll tell her.Argh.I guess theres someone else Ill need to see after that interview in Toronto.35      Wes      I approach the floor to ceiling windows of my potential apartments living room, gazing at the panoramic view of Torontos waterfront.Its definitely the best view of all the other apartments Ive looked at today, but the calm water of Lake Ontario reminds me too much of Lake Placid.Of Jamie.But who am I kidding?Everything reminds me of Jamie.Last night I couldnt even sit at the hotel bar without remembering the roadside place back at camp, where we shared our first kiss.This morning I walked past a candy shop and thought of the purple Skittles hed bought me.At the last apartment I toured, I spent ten minutes staring at the futon bed on the floor remembering the two mattresses we slid together at the dorm.I cant escape Jamie Canning, no matter how hard I try.Youre not going to find a better deal in this neighborhood, the realtor chirps.She waltzes over and stands next to me, admiring the view.Rent this low for a two bedroom Harbourfront condo?Its unheard of.I turn away from the window to study the huge open concept room.The apartment isnt furnished, but I can already imagine how it would look with furniture.Leather couch and massive flat screen in the living area.A dining room table.Some tall stools for the eat in breakfast counter.I can picture myself living here, no doubt about it.And I have to admit, Im a lot less likely to break my self imposed celibacy rule in this neighborhood.The gay scene isnt as prominent here compared to the other areas I visited.One apartment was down the street from not one, but three gay bars.Not that Im looking to hit up any bars and sample the meat market.The idea of being with anyone other than Jamie absolutely kills me.And Im not sure if this is a plus or a minus for you, the realtor continues, but the owners told me theyre planning on selling in a year or two.If youre already living here and looking to invest in real estate in the city, youd be in a great position to buy this place.I frown.What if they decide to sell earlier and Im not interesting in buying?Will I have to pick up and move?
