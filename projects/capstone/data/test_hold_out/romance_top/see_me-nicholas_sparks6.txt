Thanks for avoiding the obvious.Oh, you mean about Maria and her stalker?Thats what you want to talk about?Evan paused before going on.All right.Have you considered the idea that Ken might have hired the guy to buy and deliver the roses?Then why get them from someplace an hour away?Maybe the guy he hired is from there.Colin took a long drink from his glass of water.Maybe.But I dont think so.Why not?Because I dont think Ken has anything to do with this.Evan picked at the label on his bottle.If its any consolation, I think youre right.It isnt her boss.But on the plus side, all your private investigator, stake out the roof, and photography activities paid off in the end.Which means youre not a total idiot.Even if youre no closer to learning who it actually is.I learned something else, too.Whats that?Ill bet whoever it was watched Maria from that same spot on the roof where I took the picture.Why on earth would you think that?Because the gravel had been smoothed out where I was, and there were gum wrappers littered around that hadnt blown away.Meaning that someone had been there recently.And from that vantage point, I could see directly into Marias office.Same thing with her car and the Dumpster.Whoever it was could have spied on her for hours.I didnt put the pieces together until right before I talked to you.For the first time, Evan was quiet.Huh, he finally said.Thats it?Maybe youre right or maybe youre wrong.I dont have the answer for you.And now, Ive got this fight next weekend.So?Im having second thoughts.Why?Because of everything thats been going on with Maria.You train to fight.You like to fight.Youve been offered a fight.What does any of that have to do with Maria?Colin opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out.You know what?You give me crap all the time about how Lily has me wrapped around her little finger, but its pretty clear that I have my relationship a lot more figured out than you do.Because right now, youre trying to live your life based on what might happen or whether you can solve her problem, even when shes told you she doesnt want you to.Do you know how messed up that is?You told me she wanted to watch you fight, right?Ask her to come, take her out for dinner afterwards, and call it a date.Boom.Problem solved.Colin offered a partial smile.I think you want me to fight because youre pretty sure Im going to lose.And?Fine, Ill admit it  youre such an endless pain in the ass that it might be fun watching someone smack you around.When Colin laughed, Evan went on.Good.So thats settled.On another note, are you excited about tonight?Tonight?You and Maria?With Lily and me?We had plans, remember?I made reservations at Caprice Bistro at seven thirty, and afterwards, were hitting a club thats playing eighties music.Eighties music?Is there an echo in here?Yes, eighties music.Lilys a closet Madonna fan.A leftover from her supposedly rebellious teenage years, she says.So were doing this?As long as Marias still game, I mean.Why wouldnt she be?Maybe because you ruined her mood with what you learned?I havent told her yet.Mr.Honesty?Im shocked.I was planning on telling her tonight.If you do that, make sure you dont make too big a deal about it.I dont need you putting a damper on the evening.For all you know, it was a one time thing and its over.Or maybe, Colin said, it isnt.CHAPTER 16      Maria      C  olin had been quiet since hed picked her up, which made Maria nervous, given what hed been up to for most of the day.Though he volunteered nothing, she knew he was thinking about the flowers.As she watched him respond to her small talk with a distracted air, she felt a pit growing in her stomach.By the time they pulled into the restaurants parking lot, she couldnt contain herself any longer.Who sent the roses?He shut off the engine and told her what hed learned.She frowned, thinking about it.If it wasnt Ken, and you dont think Ken hired him, then who is it?I dont know.She turned toward the passenger window.Beyond the glass, she watched an older couple walking into the restaurant, all smiles.Without a care in the world.I saw Ken again yesterday when I was meeting with Barney, she said in a wavering voice.Other than the fact that he was acting a little distracted, he was completely professional.In fact, he barely seemed to notice me at all.It almost makes me think  That its not Ken.She could tell by Colins silence that hed been able to complete her thought.Lets try not to worry about it tonight, okay?he said.She nodded, feeling the tension in her shoulders.Ill try.Its hard not to.I know, he said.But you should probably take a moment to prepare yourself for Lily.I adore her, but she does take some getting used to.Maria forced a smile.Thats a backhanded compliment, you know.Guess who I learned it from?It took Maria only a second after entering the restaurant to identify Lily.Almost as soon as she and Colin had stepped through the door, a perfectly coiffed, ravishing blonde with eyes the color of turquoise glided toward them.She wore a stylish midlength dress and a strand of pearls.Practically every man in the restaurant turned to watch her pass.Evan, who was dressed preppy stylish and could have passed for someone still in college, trailed in her wake.Maria noticed his air of breezy confidence; he was clearly comfortable allowing Lily the limelight.Lilys smile never faltered, and as soon as she got close, she took Marias hands in her own.They were remarkably soft, like a silky baby blanket.It is an absolute delight for me to have the pleasure of your company this evening!Colin has said so many wonderful things about you.By then, Evan had reached her side.And oh, dear!Where are my manners?Im Lily, and this handsome man beside me is my fianc, Evan.Its so wonderful to meet you, Maria!Hi there, Evan said with genuine warmth.And please dont be offended if Lily doesnt let me get a word in the rest of the evening.Hush now, Evan, Lily scolded.Theres no reason to give our new friend the wrong impression about me.She returned her gaze to Maria.Please try to forgive him.Hes as sweet as can be and more intelligent than he lets on, but he went to State and he was in a fraternity.You know what that means.At least my university was coed, Evan countered.And as Ive assured him repeatedly, she responded, nudging Maria, I will never hold that flaw against him.Despite herself, Maria smiled.Its nice to meet you both.Still holding Marias hands, Lily turned to Colin.Colin, you must admit that you werent being fair to Maria at all when you told me about her!Shes absolutely breathtaking!Then back to Maria: Its no wonder that youve been all that Colin has been able to think about lately.You must know that youve been the topic of discussion every time weve spoken in recent weeks, and I can certainly understand why.Letting go of Marias hands, she kissed Colin on the cheek.Youre very handsome this evening.Did I buy you that shirt?Thank you, Colin said.And yes, you did.And thats a good thing, dont you agree?If I wasnt around, youd probably be wearing one of those awful T shirts with slogans on them.I like those shirts.She patted his arm.I know you do, bless your heart.Now, shall we head to the table?Ive been on pins and needles all day and I want to know absolutely everything about the woman who already has you wrapped around her little finger.Im not sure thats quite true, Maria protested.As true as due north.Colin  despite his stoic demeanor  is actually quite expressive in his emotions once youre familiar with them.Now, shall we?When she turned for the table, Colin shrugged at Maria, as if to say I told you so.While Maria had become acquainted with the Southern belle debutante phenomenon among the sorority girls at Chapel Hill, Colin was right: Lily took it to a whole new level.Maria initially assumed it to be partially an act, but as they settled into wide ranging conversation over dinner, she gradually changed her mind.What was interesting was that as much as Lily could talk  and the girl could talk about anything  she could also draw out information simply by the way she listened.She had a way of leaning forward slightly and nodding when appropriate; making noises of empathy or sympathy, followed by probing questions.Maria never once had the sense that Lily was trying to think of the next thing she wanted to say while Maria was still talking, and to her surprise she even found herself telling Lily and Evan about the delivery of the roses and its aftermath.At that, the table went quiet, and Lily impulsively covered Marias hand with her own.Later, while the two women were freshening up in the restroom after dinner, Maria caught Lilys reflection in the mirror.I feel like I did most of the talking, Maria said.Im sorry about that.There is absolutely no reason to apologize.You have a lot going on in your life right now, and Im flattered by your trust in us.Maria added some lipstick before her voice softened.You werent surprised by what Colin did, were you?With the photo and tracking down where the roses came from?No, Lily answered.Thats who he is.When he loves someone, hell do anything for them.It feels like half the time, Im still trying to figure him out.Im not surprised, Lily said.At the same time, since you were so honest with Evan and me, you must know that prior to dinner, my loyalties lay completely with Colin.I wanted to meet you so I could make sure that you were everything he said you were.You really care about him.I love him like a brother, Lily admitted.Hes very important to me.And I know what youre probably thinking.We couldnt be more different, and I didnt understand what Evan saw in him at first, either.All those tattoos and muscles and all the violence in his past Lily shook her head.I must have visited Evan four or five times before I ever said a word to Colin, and when I finally did, the first thing that came out of my mouth was that I thought he should find a new place to live.And do you know what Colin said to me?Okay?Maria mimicked, and Lily laughed.He does that with you, too?Bless his heart.I have been trying to break that habit to no avail, but lately Ive come to admit that it suits him.At the time, I do remember being offended.I complained to Evan and he promised to talk to Colin, but only on the condition that I talk to him first.Which of course I refused to do on principle.So who ended up breaking the ice?You or him?Colin did.Id purchased Evan a television for his birthday around that time, and it was in the trunk.Colin happened to come across me struggling with the box.He immediately offered to help.He brought it in and asked if I wanted to have it mounted or left in the box.Which was something I hadnt thought about.I told him that Evan would do it, but he sort of laughed and said that Evan wouldnt know how to do such a thing.The next thing I knew, he was on his way to the hardware store, and twenty minutes later, he was mounting it on the wall.Hed also picked up a big ribbon and bow, and it was that, more than anything, that made me wonder whether there was something about him that was worth getting to know.So we talked.It took about thirty seconds of asking him questions before I realized that he wasnt like anyone Id ever met before.Colin said you recommended that he go back to college.And that you helped him with his studies.Someone had to.The poor man hadnt cracked a book in years.But he made it easy, because once hed decided to go back, he was determined to do his best.And hes intelligent.Despite having moved from school to school, he must have picked up something along the way.And hes Evans best man?Lily pulled a tissue from her purse and dabbed at her lipstick as she nodded.Yes.Of course, my parents are absolutely aghast at the idea.As far as they know, hes Evans friend, not mine, and they continually hint that I should keep my distance.The first time my daddy saw Colin, he actually flinched, and my mama has gone so far as to suggest that he shouldnt even be invited to the wedding, let alone be the best man.Even when I tell them that hes my friend, too, they pretend they didnt hear me say it.They are rooted in their ways and I will always be their precious child, bless their hearts.My mom and dad werent too thrilled with Colin, either.Its understandable.But unlike my parents, Ill bet yours will give him a chance and eventually change their minds.I did, after all.Even now, I sometimes have trouble understanding it.In all candor, Colin and I dont have much in common.Id have to agree.Lily smiled, straightening her pearls before turning to Maria.Still, theres something about that heartfelt honesty of his, coupled with not giving a damn about what other people think about him, that just gets to me.Maria couldnt help smiling in agreement.You must believe me when I tell you, Lily added, that hes much less rough around the edges than when I first met him.Its been an extraordinary effort on my part.She winked.But theres no reason to thank me.You ready?Im sure the lads are already pining for us.I dont think Colin pines.Hes pining, she said.He might not admit it, but he is.I wasnt pining, Colin said on the way to his car.Up ahead, Lily was walking with Evan toward his Prius.I was talking to Evan about my fight.The one in Myrtle Beach?No.The one next weekend.What fight?Colin filled her in, then added, Evan will be coming.You should come, too.Will Lily come?No, Colin said.Fightings not really Lilys thing.Im surprised its Evans thing.He always goes to my fights.He enjoys them.Really?He doesnt seem the type.And what type is that?People who resemble you, Maria teased.Big muscles and tattoos, but mainly people who dont look like theyll faint at the first sign of blood.He smiled.Do you want to come?Sure.But the same rule applies.You cant get too beat up or itll bring back memories of the first night we met.Okay.You say that now, but the way you talked about Johnny Reese, you might not be able to guarantee it.No guarantees, he conceded.What did you and Lily talk about when you were in the bathroom?Mainly we talked about you.Okay.No follow up questions?No.How can you not be interested in what we said?Because that was between you and Lily.Its not my business.And besides, it couldnt have been too bad, or you wouldnt still be holding my hand.So what kind of club are we going to?All I know is that it plays eighties music.Thats one of Lilys quirks.Evan told me that listening to Madonna was the way she rebelled when she was a teenager.Huh.Not much of a rebellion  Not to you or me.But to Lilys parents?Im sure they wrung their hands for years.They dont like me much.Maybe you should invite them to a fight, she said.Thatll probably change their minds.She heard him laugh as he opened her door, the sound continuing as he rounded the car to the drivers side.Despite the blaring sound of REO Speedwagon, the scene at the club wasnt at all what she expected.Instead of divorced women and balding men in their forties trying to relive their youth, the club was populated primarily by students from the university; Maria half expected to spot Serena with her friends.Groups of college girls were dancing in clusters, singing or lip syncing to the music.Colin leaned closer to her ear.What do you think?I feel old, she admitted.But I like the music.Evan pointed toward the bar, and Colin nodded before reaching for her hand, maneuvering her around tables and groups of people to the thronged bar area.When they were finally able to get the bartenders attention, Colin ordered water  no surprise there  Evan ordered a beer, and both Maria and Lily ordered sea breezes.Halfway through their drinks, a song by Madonna started to play and a delighted Lily clapped before leading Evan to the floor.Suddenly thinking, Oh, what the hell?, Maria grabbed Colins hand and they followed.The evening sped by as they danced to sets of three or four songs in a row, stopping only for the occasional break.Maria ordered a second sea breeze, and though she hadnt finished the first, she felt giddy and flushed.For the first time in a week, shed actually been able to enjoy herself.At half past eleven, they were able to commandeer a small table for the first time.They were taking a break and debating how much longer to stay when a young cocktail waitress appeared holding a tray of drinks.She placed another sea breeze in front of Maria.Maria waved it off.I didnt order this.Your friend ordered it, the waitress explained, straining to be heard above the music.Maria shot Colin a quizzical look.You ordered another drink?When he shook his head, she turned to Evan, who seemed as surprised as Colin.Lily also appeared confused.Who ordered it?Maria asked.Your friend from the bar, the waitress said, turning her head in that direction.The one in the baseball cap.She leaned in.He told me to tell you that he was upset that you didnt like the roses he sent you.Maria gasped; a split second later, she saw a sudden movement as Colin jumped up from the table, causing his chair to tip over.In the moments that followed, Maria was only able to register a series of images, like snapshots caught in a strobe light:  Colin taking two steps toward the waitress, his jaw beginning to clench closing in so quickly that she dropped the tray of cocktails  Evan and Lily getting up from the table, their drinks sloshing over them  Bar patrons turning their way at the commotion  Colin demanding that the cocktail waitress tell him exactly who it was at the bar, ferociously angry, repeating the question  The waitress backing away, terrified  Bouncers beginning to move toward them  Evan taking a step toward Colin, his hands raised  Maria was frozen, rooted to her seat, the waitresss words ringing in her ear.Baseball cap He was upset you didnt like the roses  He was here.Hed followed her.Hed been following her all along  It was hard for her to breathe, a waterfall of images, the world collapsing inward.Bouncers pushing through the crowd, moving with frightening speed  Colin shouting, demanding to know more about the man whod ordered the drink  The waitress backing away, beginning to cry  Bystanders beginning to surround them  Evan pushing forward and grabbing Colins arm  Lily moving toward Maria  Maria felt someone place both hands on her shoulders and begin helping her from her seat.She didnt have the energy to resist, and all at once, she realized that Lily had been the one to whisk her to her feet.She could hear Colin shouting, even as Evan continued to tug hard at Colins arm, the waitress crying out in terror, strangers circling, with bouncers close behind.Stranger in blue shirt: What the hells going on?Colin, to the waitress: What did he look like?Stranger with spiked hair: Chill out!Leave her alone!Waitress, through her tears: I told you that I dont know!He was wearing a hat!I dont know!Stranger with tattoos: What the hells wrong with you?Evan: We gotta go!Colin: Was he young or old?Waitress: I dont know!Twenties or thirties?I dont know!Evan: Now, Colin!Come on!By then, Lily was leading Maria quickly from the table, and out of the corner of her eye, Maria saw Evan jerk Colin off balance.Colin reacted instinctively, twisting free immediately and quickly regaining his equilibrium, his hands ducking into fighting position.His face was red and tense, the muscles in his neck taut; for an instant, he seemed not to recognize Evan.Colin!No!Lily screamed.Evan took a step backward, and as quickly as it had erupted, Colins rage began to dissipate.By then, the bouncers had reached them, and as Maria watched, Colin slipped his hands behind his back, clasping his left wrist with his right hand.A bouncer grabbed both his arms, looking as angry and adrenaline filled as Colin had been a moment earlier.Ill go with you, Colin said.Ill go.Then, to the waitress, who was still crying, he said, I apologize.I didnt mean to scare you.But neither the waitress nor the bouncers cared; Colin was dragged outside and it was only a few minutes later that a squad car arrived, blue lights flashing.Shortly thereafter, a dark sedan pulled up.Whos that?Maria asked, standing with Evan out front, arms crossed.Lily had gone back into the club a few minutes earlier.In the parking lot, Colin stood with two officers, one of the bouncers, and a man in a well used sport coat who was chewing on a toothpick.Evans tone betrayed his concern.Detective Margolis.Hes been waiting for Colin to screw up again.Why?Because he thinks Colin should be in prison.Is that going to happen?I dont know, Evan said.But he didnt do anything, Maria protested.He didnt even touch her.Thank God, or hed be cuffed by now.And he still might be, unless Lily can work her magic.Whats she doing?Solving the problem, Evan answered.Thats what Lily does.In time, Lily emerged through the front doors, stopping to shake hands with one of the bouncers who had dragged Colin out.She smiled ingenuously as she approached the officers.Maria watched as Margolis caught sight of her and held up his hand to stop her.Lily ignored him, pressing on until she was close enough to be heard, and for an interminable few minutes, both Evan and Maria watched, wondering what Lily could possibly be saying to him.Eventually, one of the officers followed the bouncer back inside the club while Margolis and the other officer remained with Colin.Margolis was obviously furious, but still no move was made to cuff Colin.The events of the last half hour caused Marias thoughts to ping pong, wreaking havoc on her emotions.Shed been followed to the bar, which meant shed been followed from the restaurant, which meant shed been followed from home.He knew where she lived and hed followed her here.Her breath caught, and she distantly registered Evans voice.Are you okay?She squeezed her upper arms.She wanted Colin to hold her, yet she was angry that hed lost control.Or was she afraid for him?She wasnt sure.He knew where she lived and hed followed her here.No, she admitted, realizing that she was shaking.Im not.She felt Evan slip an arm around her.Its pretty messed up, thats for sure.If I were you, Id be a wreck.Whats going to happen to Colin?Hell be all right.How do you know?Because Lily looks calm and Margolis looks pissed.Maria studied the two of them, realizing that Evan was right.But everything had gone wrong tonight.A minute later, the officer whod gone into the club returned to Margoliss side.They spoke for a couple of minutes before both officers reluctantly headed back to their squad car.By then, Lily was hurrying toward Evan and Maria.Evan let go of Maria to encircle Lily in his arms.No charges, she said.Theyre letting him go.What did you do?Maria asked.I spoke to the waitress and the manager, and I simply told them the truth, Lily replied.That you were being stalked, and that Colin overreacted because youve been frightened, and Colin thought you might be in danger.They were surprisingly sympathetic.Especially once I gave the waitress an extra large tip, paid for the drinks that were spilled, and offered the manager a little extra for his trouble.Maria stared at her.You bribed them?I did no such thing.I merely did my best to rectify the situation in a way that satisfied everyone involved.By the time the officer came to speak with them, they were both adamant that no charges be filed.Still, I will admit there was a moment when I wasnt sure it was going to work again.Again?It isnt the first time this has happened, Evan said.Margolis dogged Colins footsteps as Colin approached their group.To others, Colin probably appeared as controlled as he always did, but she noticed something in his expression that hinted at an understanding of how close hed come to losing it all.He moved to her side as Margolis studied each of their faces.Colin stared back, unfazed, as did Evan and Lily.The dynamic duo strikes again, Margolis sneered.How much did it cost you this time?I dont have any idea what youre talking about, Lily lied sweetly, her accent as sultry as ever.Of course you dont, Margolis said.I wonder what the manager and the waitress would say if I put them under oath.He let the comment hang, with all its implications, before finally going on.But theres no reason for that, is there?Now that youve rescued your good friend Colin again.There was no need to rescue him, Lily drawled.He did nothing wrong.Thats funny.Because I recall something like this happening on at least two other occasions when you two were there.Lily feigned confusion.Are you speaking of those other occasions when Colin happened to be out with us and, again, did nothing wrong?Keep telling yourself that.Youre just postponing the inevitable.Colin knows who he is.Just ask him.Hell tell you.He turned toward Colin.Isnt that right, Colin?Since you like to convince everyone youre as honest as the day is long?Even though youre always on the verge of exploding.Maria saw Colins eyes narrow as Margolis jerked his head at Evan.You need to thank Evan here for pulling you away when he did.Had even one of those guys around you touched you, you and I both know that we would suddenly be spending a lot of time together, with you back in the cage and me telling the DA to throw away the key.Colin didnt touch anyone, Evan interjected.Margolis shifted the toothpick to the other side of his mouth.I was thinking more along the lines of assault.I was told the waitress was terrified by the fact that Colin was screaming at her, and Ive got a dozen witnesses in there who could vouch for that.He just wanted to know who sent over the drink, Maria protested.As soon as Margoliss eyes met hers, she felt herself flinch.Oh, thats right.Because of the so called stalker, right?Ill make sure to review the report for you.Maria said nothing, regretting shed chimed in.Oh, wait.You havent filed a report?Have you even talked to a lawyer?She is a lawyer, Lily said.Then its even stranger, dont you think?All lawyers do is file reports.He turned toward Maria.Ill tell you what, though; if you ever do get around to it, ask for me, okay?Leave her out of this, Colin growled.Are you telling me what to do?Margolis demanded.Yes, Colin said.Or what?Are you going to hit me?Colin continued to stare at him before reaching for Marias hand.Lets go, he said, beginning to walk away, Evan and Lily close behind.Go ahead, Margolis called out from behind them.Ill be around.How much do I owe you?Colin said.Lets worry about that later, okay?Lily answered.Theyd followed Evan and Lily back to Evans place, the four of them congregating on the front porch.It had been a quiet ride, Marias thoughts too fragmented for conversation, and Colin in no mood to break the silence.Even now, Maria felt like an observer to her own life.What the hell were you doing tonight?Evan demanded.Weve talked about this!And Margolis is right!What would have happened if Lily and I hadnt been there?I dont know, Colin answered.You damn well know exactly what would have happened!Evan ran a hand through his hair.Why the hell do you keep doing this?Youve got to learn to control this thing.Okay.Dont say okay!Evan shouted.Like Lily, Im sick of you saying that all the time, because its a cop out!I thought wed gotten past this last year, after that guy accidentally spilled his drink on Lily.Youre right, Colin said evenly.I made a mistake.I lost control.Gee, really?Evan spat out.He turned, starting for the front door.Whatever.You two deal with him for now.Im done.The door slammed behind him, leaving the three of them on the porch.You know that Evans right, Colin, Lily said.I wasnt going to hurt her.That doesnt matter, she said, her voice soft.Youre big and strong, and when youre angry, people can sense the innate violence within you.The poor waitress was cowering and crying and you wouldnt let up until Evan put everything he had into pulling you away.And then, I was almost certain you were going to hit him.Colins gaze dropped to the ground before slowly coming up again, and for a moment, his confidence was gone.In its place Maria saw shame and remorse, maybe even a flash of hopelessness.It wont happen again.Maybe, Lily said, kissing him on the cheek.You said that the last time, too.She turned toward Maria and offered a hug.And Im absolutely certain that all of this must feel both overwhelming and terrifying to you.If someone was stalking and taunting me, I would have already been off to Charleston by now to hide out with my parents, and knowing them, theyd send me out of the country.Im just so sorry for what youre going through.Thank you, Maria said.Suddenly exhausted, she barely recognized the sound of her own voice.Would you like to come inside?Lily asked when she pulled back.Im sure Evan is calmer by now, and we can work through some options or ideas or we can just sit and listen if you feel like you need to talk.I wouldnt even know what to say, she said.Lily understood, and with a gentle click of the door as it closed behind her, Maria and Colin were alone on the front porch.Im sorry, Maria, he mumbled.I know.Would you like me to bring you home?In either direction, most of the houses were already dark.I dont want to go home, she said in a small voice.He knows where I live.Colin stretched out his hand.Cmon, he said.You can stay with me.Leaving the porch, they walked around the side of the house, toward the downstairs entrance.Once inside, Colin turned on the lights as he led the way.Hoping for any distraction from the lingering knot in her stomach, she took in the room.Average sized, with a kitchen off to the right and a small hallway directly ahead that no doubt led to the bedroom and bath.Surprisingly neat, without clutter piled on the coffee table or on the counters.Neutral color scheme for the furniture, with no photographs or personal items, like no one lived here at all.This is your place?He nodded.For now.Can I get you something to drink?Just water, she said.Colin filled two glasses in the kitchen, bringing one of them to her.She took a sip, suddenly remembering that she was being followed and seeing again Colins anger as hed demanded answers from the waitress, his muscles tense.She remembered the split second after Evan had jerked him off balance and the utter wildness and uncontrollable fury in his expression.How are you feeling?he finally asked.She tried to force the image away and realized that she couldnt.Not good, she said.Not good at all.Neither of them seemed to know what to say to the other in the living room, nor later, when they were in bed together.Instead, simply needing to be held, Maria rolled over, resting her head on Colins chest, conscious of the lingering tension in his body.Shed hoped that by staying here, with Colin beside her, shed feel safe.But she didnt feel safe.Not anymore.And as she lay awake, staring into the darkness, she was beginning to wonder whether she ever would again.In the morning, Colin drove Maria home and waited in the living room while she showered and changed, but he didnt join her for brunch at her parents.He understood that right now, she needed to be alone with her family, a haven of stability and predictability amid a life that suddenly felt wildly off course.He walked her to her car and while they embraced, she found herself holding back slightly.At the house, her parents were oblivious, but Serena figured out something was bothering Maria as soon as she stepped inside, something Maria didnt want to share with her parents.Serena played along perfectly, maintaining a stream of commentary as they cooked and ate, filling any silences with the sound of her voice and keeping the conversation from drifting toward anything serious.Afterwards, Maria and Serena went for a walk.As soon as they reached a safe distance from the house, Serena turned and said, Spill it.On a bench beneath an elm tree with leaves that had begun to turn gold, Maria told Serena everything that had happened, reliving the terror of the past several days, and when she started to cry, Serena began to cry as well.Like Maria, Serena was upset and scared; like Maria, she had more questions than answers.Questions at which Maria could only shake her head.After lunch, Serena and her parents headed off to Marias uncles house, an informal family get together like countless others, but Maria begged off, claiming she had a headache and wanted to take a nap.While her dad accepted the explanation without question, Marias mother was dubious, though she knew enough not to press her.On the way out the door, she hugged Maria longer than usual and asked how things were going with Colin.The sound of his name brought a sudden wellspring of tears, and on her way to the car, Maria thought, Ive officially become a basket case.Even concentrating enough to drive was strangely difficult.Despite the traffic, all she could think was that someone was watching her, waiting for her to return or maybe he was even following her now.Impulsively, she changed lanes and made a quick turn onto a side street, her eyes glued to the rearview mirror.She turned again, then once more before finally pulling over.And though she wanted to be strong  pleaded with God to help her be strong  she found herself bent over the steering wheel, sobbing.Who was he and what did he want?The nameless, faceless man in the baseball cap  why hadnt she looked for him?All she remembered were shadows and fragments, nothing at all  But there was more, too, something that kept her anxious and on the verge of tears.Without thinking, she put the car in gear and started driving, eventually making her way to a quiet stretch of Carolina Beach.The day was cool and the breeze held the nip of the coming winter as she walked the sand.Clouds had rolled in, white and gray, and it felt like impending rain.The waves rolled in calming rhythm, and as she walked, she finally felt her thoughts beginning to settle long enough for a bit of clarity to emerge.She wasnt on edge simply because she was being followed.Nor was she merely reliving the fears shed felt for Colin as hed stood with the police officers with the rest of his life hanging in the balance.She saw now that she was also afraid of Colin, and as sick as the thought made her feel, she couldnt push the feeling away.Knowing that she needed to talk to Colin, Maria drove to Evans.When Colin opened the door to his apartment, she saw that he had been studying at the small kitchen table.Though he invited her in, she declined, the interior of his place appearing suddenly claustrophobic.Instead, they went to Evans porch, each taking a seat in a rocking chair as the rain began to fall.Colin perched on the edge of his seat, forearms resting on his legs.He looked tired, the last twenty four hours obviously taking a toll.He did nothing to break the silence, and for a moment, Maria wasnt even sure where to begin.Ive been on edge ever since last night, she ventured, so if Im not making much sense, its probably because my thoughts are still jumbled.She drew a breath.I mean, I know you were just trying to help me.But Lily was right.Even though I believe you when you say that you werent going to hurt the waitress, the way you were acting told a different story.I almost lost control.No, she said.You did lose control.I cant control my emotions.The only thing I can control is my behavior, and I didnt touch her.Dont try to minimize what happened.Im not trying to minimize it.What if you get angry with me?I would never hurt you.And like the waitress, I might end up terrified and in tears anyway.If youd acted like that toward me, Id never want to talk to you again.And then, with Evan  I didnt do anything to Evan.But had it been anyone else who grabbed you  a guy you didnt know  you wouldnt have been able to stop, and you know it.Just like Margolis said.She made sure to hold his gaze.Or are you going to lie to me for the first time and say Im wrong?I was scared for you.Because the guy was there.But what you did didnt make it better.I just wanted to find out what he looked like.And you dont think I do?she said, raising her voice.But tell me this  what if hed still been there?Just sitting at the bar?What would you have done then?Do you honestly believe that you were capable of having a reasonable conversation with him?No.You would have overreacted, and right now, youd be in prison.Im sorry.You already apologized.She hesitated.As much as weve discussed your past and as much as I thought I knew you, I realize that I dont.Last night, you werent the guy I fell in love with, or even a guy I would have dated.Instead, I saw someone that  in my past  I would have gladly put away.What are you trying to say?I dont know, she said.All I know is that I dont have the energy to start worrying that youll do something dumb and throw your life away, or that youll end up frightening me because something inside you suddenly switches on.Its not your job to worry about me.At his comment, she flushed, all her fears and anxieties and anger rising to the surface like an air bubble moving through water.Dont be a hypocrite!What the hell do you think all that was about last night?Or the past week, for that matter?You hid out on a roof for hours to take pictures of my boss, called every florist in the city, and drove two hours to show a stranger a photograph!You did that because you were worried about me.And now youre saying that Im not allowed to worry about you?Why is it okay for you to worry, but not for me   Maria   Let me finish!she demanded.I told you that what was happening to me wasnt your problem!I told you to let it go!But you were dead set on doing whatever the hell you wanted And okay, maybe you did talk me into letting you take the photos.Because you made it sound like you knew what you were doing  like you could handle it.But based on last night, you obviously cant!You were almost arrested!And then what would have happened?Do you have any idea what that would have done to me?How I would have felt?She pressed her fingers to her eyelids and was trying to organize her thoughts when she heard her cell phone ring.Pulling it from her pocket, she recognized Serenas number and wondered why she was calling.Hadnt she said something about going on a date?She answered and instantly heard the panic in Serenas voice, the words spilling out in rapid Spanish.Come home now!Serena sobbed before Maria could say a single word.Maria felt her chest constrict.Whats wrong?Is Dad okay?What happened?Its Mom and Dad!Because of Copo!Shes dead!CHAPTER 17      Colin      C  olin worried that Maria was too shaky to get behind the wheel, so he drove her car to her parents house, trying to read her mood as she stared out the rain splattered window.Between her sobs, Serena hadnt been able to tell Maria much  no one really knew anything other than that Copo was dead.As soon as they pulled into the driveway, Maria rushed into the house, Colin trailing behind.Her parents sat holding each other on the sofa, haggard and red eyed.Serena stood near the kitchen, wiping at her tears.Felix stood from the couch as soon as Maria entered, and they both began weeping.Soon the whole family was standing with their arms around each other, crying while Colin stood quietly in the doorway.When their tears abated, they all collapsed on the couch, Maria continuing to hold her fathers hand.They were speaking in Spanish, so he couldnt follow much of the story, but he heard more than enough to let him know that the dogs death had made no sense at all.Later, he sat with Maria on the back porch and she caught him up on what shed learned, which wasnt much.Her parents and Serena had gone to their relatives after brunch, and while normally theyd bring the dog, there were going to be a lot of kids there, and theyd been worried that Copo might get overwhelmed, or worse, accidentally hurt.Serena had returned to the house an hour later because shed left her cell phone charging on the kitchen counter.When Serena saw Copo lying near the back slider  which had been left open  she assumed the dog was sleeping.But when the dog hadnt moved by the time she was about to leave, Serena called out to her.Copo didnt respond, so Serena went to check on her, only to realize that the dog had died.She called her parents, who drove straight home, and then Maria.Copo was fine before they left.Shed eaten and wasnt acting sick.There was nothing for her to have choked on, and my dad didnt find anything in her throat.There wasnt any blood or vomit She drew a shaky breath.Its like she died for no reason, and my dad Ive never seen him cry before.He brought her everywhere; they hardly ever left her alone.You cant understand how much he loved that little dog.I can only imagine, he said.Maybe, she said.But still you have to understand that in the village my parents came from, dogs work or herd or spend time with you in the field, but they arent regarded as pets.My father never understood the American love affair with dogs.Both Serena and I begged for a dog when we were younger, but he was adamantly opposed.And then, when Serena and I left home, there was suddenly a gigantic void in his life At some point someone suggested they get a dog, and this time, it was like a light suddenly went on for him.Copo was like his child, but more obedient and devoted.She shook her head, quiet for a moment.Shes not even four years old.I mean can a dog just die?Have you ever heard of that happening before?No.Shed expected the answer, but it didnt help, and her thoughts circled back to the reason shed needed to talk to him.Colin About what we were talking about earlier  You were right.About everything.She sighed.I care about you, Colin.I love you and want nothing more than to be with you, but  The word but hung heavy in the air.Im not who you thought I was.No, she said.Youre exactly who I thought you were, and you warned me right up front.And I thought I could handle it, but last night, I realized that I dont think I can.What does that mean?She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.I think that for right now, it might be best to slow things down a bit.Between us, I mean.With all thats going on She didnt finish.But she didnt have to.What are you going to do about the guy following you?I dont know.Its hard for me to even think straight right now.Thats what he wants.He wants you worried and afraid, constantly on edge.She pushed her hands into her hair, kneading her temples.When she spoke, her voice was ragged.Right now, I feel like Im stuck in this awful dream and all I want to do is wake up And on top of everything else, I have to support my parents.My dad wants to bury Copo tonight, and thats only going to make him even more emotional.My mom, too.And this rain Of all the weekends for Copo to die, why this one?Colin peered out at the backyard.How about I help get things ready?Maria brought him a shovel from the garage, and after a little back and forth between Maria and Felix, Colin started digging a hole in the shade of an oak tree, rain soaking through his shirt.He remembered doing the same thing for his own dog, Penny, a long haired miniature dachshund.The dog had slept with him in bed when hed still been living at home, and while at school hed missed her more than his family.He remembered how hard it had been to dig the grave the summer after his sophomore year; it was one of the few times he could recall crying since the first year hed been sent away.With every shovelful of dirt, hed had a memory of Penny  running through the grass or nipping at a butterfly  and he wanted to spare Felix that.The task also got him away from Maria.He understood her need for space right now, even if he didnt like thinking about the reason.He knew hed screwed up royally, and right now, she was probably trying to figure out whether Colin was worth the risk.When Colin finished digging the pit under the tree, the family buried Copo.Again, all four of them cried and exchanged hugs.And after they went back inside, Colin began to shovel the dirt back in place, his thoughts returning to the stalker and the fact that Maria was being followed.He wondered what the stalkers next move might be.And he decided then and there that whether Maria wanted him in her life or not, he would be there if she ever needed him.Are you sure?Maria asked him, standing with him on the front porch.Id be happy to drive you home.Inside, Carmen and Serena were making dinner.Felix, as far as Colin knew, was still on the back porch, sitting alone and holding Copos collar.Ill be okay.I need to run anyway.But its still raining.Im already wet.Isnt it kind of far?Like five or six miles?You need to stay here with your family, he said, and for a moment, neither of them said anything.Can I call you?he finally asked.Her gaze flickered toward the house before returning to him.Why dont I call you?He nodded before taking a step backward, and without another word, he turned and began to run.Maria didnt call for the rest of the week, and it was the first time in his life that he cared enough about a girl for that to actually matter to him.Or enough for him to even think about it in unexpected moments, or whenever the phone rang  which wasnt often.He wasnt going to call her.He wanted to; more than once, hed actually reached for his phone before reminding himself shed asked him not to.Whether she eventually called or not was her choice.To keep from dwelling on it, he tried to stay busy.He added an extra shift at work, and after his classes and before his shifts, he spent time at the gym, working with Daly and Moore.They were more excited about the upcoming fight than he was.While fighting someone like Reese was a rare opportunity to measure his own skill level, win or lose, it wouldnt mean much for him in the long run.For Daly and Moore, a good match might mean a minor windfall for the gym.No wonder they spent the first two hours on Monday reviewing films of Reeses former fights with Colin, studying his tendencies and evaluating strengths and weaknesses.Hes good, but hes not unbeatable, Daly continued to insist, Moore in agreement.Colin listened while trying to tune out comments that he regarded as too wishful or optimistic  basically, anything that had the words Reese and ground in the same sentence.Reese would eat him alive on the ground.On the plus side, the films showed that Colins skills were slightly better than Reeses when it came to striking.Especially kicks; to that point in his career, not a single fighter had gone after Reese with kicks to the knees, despite Reese offering numerous opportunities.Reese also left himself open to shots at the ribs after any combination, which was useful to know when planning a strategy.The problem was that when the fight actually started, strategies often went right out the window, but thats where  according to Daly and Moore  Colin had the biggest advantage.Reese hasnt ever fought anyone with more than six or seven fights under his belt, which meant his opponents have been both outclassed and intimidated.You wont be intimidated, and that will rattle him more than anything.Daly and Moore were right.Fighting  whether in bars, the street, or even the ring  wasnt only about skill but confidence and control as well.It was all about waiting for the right moment and then taking advantage of it; it was about experience when adrenaline was pumping, and Colin had had more fights than Reese.Reese had been an athlete, someone who shook hands with his opponent after a match; Colin was the kind of guy who struck first and broke beer bottles over peoples heads at the end, the sole intent to cause as much damage as quickly as possible.With that said, Reese was undefeated for a reason.On his best day, Colin figured he had only a one in four chance of winning, and that was only if he was able to make it through the first couple of rounds.The kicks to the knees and rib shots, the coaches continued to assure him, would wear Reese down the longer the fight went on.The third round will be yours, they promised.On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, they got to work, with an hour and fifteen minutes each day devoted to specific strikes.Daly got in the ring wearing sturdy knee braces and a vest, demanding that Colin make kicks to the knees, offering openings and then taking them away.Simultaneously, Moore instructed Colin to keep his distance and concentrate on the ribs after every combination Daly threw, their exhortations heated and demanding.In the last forty five minutes, Colin focused on ground work, honing defensive techniques.They were all fully aware that Reese had a significant advantage in this area, and the best that Colin could hope for was to survive.Hed never trained for a specific opponent, and it proved frustrating.He missed with kicks and was too slow with strikes to the ribs; all too often, he allowed himself to get tied up, which was exactly what Reese would want.It wasnt until Thursday that the lightbulb flickered on, albeit dimly, and when he walked out of the gym, he wished he had another couple of weeks to get ready.Friday was a rest day, the first day that Colin hadnt worked out in over a year, and he needed the break.Everything hurt.With no classes, he spent the morning and afternoon completing two papers.Later, at work, with cooler temperatures setting in, hardly any customers showed up on the rooftop, even during the dinner rush.By nine, there were no patrons at all, and Colin had the place to himself.Tips had been almost nonexistent, but it gave him time to reflect on the previous weekend.Or, more specifically, the question Maria had asked that had been plaguing him on and off ever since.Of all the weekends for Copo to die, why this one?There was nothing to suggest that the guy who was following Maria was responsible for Copos death, but there wasnt anything that rendered the idea implausible, either.If the guy knew where Maria lived, it was more than conceivable he also knew where her parents lived.The back slider had been left open.Copo had been fine when they left, and three hours later the dog was dead for no apparent reason.Colin knew it wouldnt have taken much to have snapped Copos neck or choked the dog to death.Or, on the other hand, the dog could have died a natural, if unexplained, death.He wondered whether the same terrible thoughts had occurred to Maria; if so, she would also suspect that the stalking had escalated to a new level, and he wondered whether she would call him.If not as her lover, then as a friend whod promised to be there for her.Colin checked his phone.She hadnt called.Colin spent Saturday morning trying to get ahead in his reading, though by noon, he wasnt sure why hed even bothered.Nerves kept him from recalling anything of substance.He wasnt hungry, either; it had been all he could do to force down a couple of protein smoothies.The feeling of nerves was new to him.He reminded himself that he didnt care about winning, but at the same time, he also admitted he was lying to himself.If he didnt care how he did in the ring, why watch everything he ate or drank?Why train two or three times a day?And would he have agreed to spend all week preparing for Johnny Reese?Fact was, he hadnt yet walked into the cage thinking hed lose a fight.Amateurs were amateurs.But Reese was different.Reese could give him a beat down if Colin made a single wrong move; Reese was just plain better.Unless my strategy pays off  He felt a sudden, unexpected surge of adrenaline.Not good.Too early.Hed be wasted before the fight even started, and he had to get his mind off it.Best way to do that was to go for a run to clear his mind, even if his coaches would want him to conserve his energy.Too bad.He ran anyway.It was only partly successful.Hours later, Colin sat alone in the makeshift dressing room.Hed been weighed, as had his gloves.Daly made sure that the amount of athletic tape on his hands met regulations.Colin opted to wear a cup, and his shoes were inspected by officials.Tons of rules, even at the amateur level.There were only ten minutes before his fight began, and hed asked Daly and Moore to leave him, even though he knew they wanted to stay.Their attitude pissed him off.In the minutes leading up to any fight, pretty much everything and everyone pissed him off, which was just what he wanted.He thought about knee and rib strikes; he thought about keeping Reese rattled and owning the third round.Already the adrenaline was making every muscle taut, his senses heightened.Beyond the walls, he heard the roar of the crowd, then heard as it became even louder.No doubt a fighter was exerting his will over another, the match clearly coming to an end, an opponent getting pummeled  Colin drew a long breath.Showtime.The next thing he knew, he was face to face with Reese at the center of the cage, each of them sizing the other up while the referee went over the rules: no biting, no kicks to the nuts, et cetera.As they stared at each other the world began to shrink, sounds diminishing, and then the fighters were released to their corners.Daly and Moore shouted encouragement, but Colin only vaguely registered their voices.The bell sounded, and he stepped forward.Colin landed a kick to Reeses knee within the first twenty seconds, then another two quickly after that.All three shots seemed to catch Reese off guard, and when Colin hit the knee a fourth time, he saw Reeses first flash of anger.A fifth kick to the knee came next, and Reese began keeping his distance, already having deciphered part of Colins plan.They traded blows for the next couple of minutes, with Colin landing three quality shots to the ribs and one more hard kick to the knee.Reeses boxing skills were about what Colin had expected, but his punches were harder, and when Reese landed a shot to Colins temple, Colin saw stars and ended up on his back.Reese was clearly in control, but Colin was able to hold his own defensively until the bell sounded.Both fighters were breathing hard.According to Daly, the round could go either way, though he thought Colin had the advantage.The second round followed roughly the same pattern: Colin landed three more kicks to the knee, with Reese noticeably wincing after the final shot; Colin hammered on Reeses ribs whenever the opportunity presented itself.Two thirds of the way through, they were on the ground again, with Reese landing a couple of strong blows while Colin did everything he could to defend himself.In the final twenty seconds, Reeses elbow connected with the bridge of Colins nose and opened up a gash.Blood seeped into his eye, he lost concentration, and Reese took advantage, twisting his leg until Colin nearly had to tap.Colin knew as he returned to his corner that while he hadnt been completely dominated, hed lost the round.He also noticed that Reese was limping badly as he made his way back to his corner.Colin attacked the knee again to open the third round, then jabbed and feinted a couple of rushes, returning to the knee repeatedly.On the final kick, Reese winced hard and instinctively bent over; Colin moved in and went hard to the ribs.Out of position, Reese tried to lock up Colin, but Colin brought up his knee, felt it connect with Reeses forehead, and for the first time in the match had Reese on his back and seriously in trouble.Colin went as hard as he could, striking with his fists and elbows.Reese hadnt been in this position very often, and Colin could sense him begin to panic.Colin continued to strike, landing more blows with as much force as possible.Reese took a hard shot to the jaw and his body went slack; Colin landed three more shots that left Reese stunned.Colin pressed his advantage, and as the round ticked toward its close, Reese made a tactical mistake.Colin was nearly able to end the fight with an arm bar, only to have Reese somehow wiggle free.Precious seconds ticked by before Colin maneuvered Reese into position for another arm bar.Just as Colin began to apply pressure, the bell sounded, the referee jumped in, and the fight was over.Colin reluctantly rose, only to see Daly and Moore pumping their fists; in their minds, it was clear whod won the fight.Reeses, too; as he rose, he avoided Colins eyes.The judges, however, didnt score it that way.When Reeses arm was raised in victory by a plainly skeptical referee, Colin knew that hed just been handed his first defeat.Colin shook Reeses hand and Daly and Moore charged into the ring.The crowd began to boo and catcall.Colin tuned it all out; he was spent.He left the cage and headed toward the locker room alone, only mildly disappointed and not terribly surprised.If its any consolation, you dont look nearly as bad as you did after your last fight, Evan noted.As was becoming a custom after Colins fights, they were at a sketchy roadside diner, Evan watching Colin eat.Just that little cut on the bridge of your nose, but other than that, youre good.Which is definitely an improvement.Last time, you could have passed for Rocky after the fight with Apollo Creed.And that guy sucked.He head butted me.He might have cheated in the fight, but unlike tonight, the decision in that one was fair.You know you kicked his ass, right?It wasnt even close.The crowd knew it, and so did the referee.Did you see his face when they announced Reese?No.He couldnt believe it.Even Reeses coach was shocked.Colin used his fork to slice into his pancakes and stabbed a mouthful.Okay.If it had gone on another twenty seconds, Reese would have tapped out.Maybe ten.There was no way he was stopping that last arm bar because he was toast by then.The guy could barely do anything at that point.I know.Then why arent you more upset?Your coaches are pissed as hell.You should be pissed, too.Because its over, Colin answered.Theres nothing I can do now.You could register a protest.No.Then at the very least, you should have clocked Reese when he started doing that stupid dance after the announcement.Did you see that?No.The fight had to be rigged.They wanted Reese to finish his amateur career undefeated.Whos they?I dont know.The judges, the promoter, whoever.My point is, the fix was in.The fix was in?You sound like a character in a gangster movie.Im just saying that no matter what you did, short of knocking him out or having him tap out, Reese was going to win that fight.Colin shrugged.Reese is heading to the pros.I was a last minute fill in.Its better for everyone if he finished undefeated as an amateur.Youre kidding.That stuff matters?Not officially.But produce a fighter from this area that gets to the UFC and its good for everyone.You make it sound like a business, not a sport.Its the truth.Evan shook his head.Fine.Be philosophical about it or whatever.Do you think you won?Colin took a forkful of eggs.Yes.After a moment, Evan shook his head.I still think you should have clocked him when he started doing that dance.Hell, I wanted to clock him.Okay.Evan leaned back in his seat.All right, then.Since youre fine with it, Im glad I got to watch you get your ass kicked.Especially after the fiasco last weekend.Okay.And theres something else, too.Yeah?Maria was there tonight.Colin lifted his chin, instantly alert.She was with another girl who could have been her twin, Evan added.Well, not exactly like her, but close enough.You know what I mean.They were on the opposite side of the ring, way in the back.But it was her, without a doubt.Okay.Whats going on with the two of you, anyway?Colin forked a piece of sausage.I dont know.CHAPTER 18      Maria      T  hanks again for coming, Maria said to Serena on the drive back to Wilmington.The rain blew in soft sheets, making the oncoming headlights shimmer.It was fun, Serena said from the passenger seat, a soda wedged between her legs.It was also one of the more interesting Saturday nights Ive had in a long time.I think I actually know one of the fighters.Duh, Maria said.You were the one who set us up.Im not talking about Colin.Im talking about one of the other fighters  I think Ive seen him on campus.Of course, from where we were standing, its not as though I could be certain.Tell me again why we didnt try to get closer?Because I didnt want Colin to know I was there.And again why is that?Because we havent talked since last weekend, Maria said.I already told you all of this.I know, I know.He yelled at the waitress and the police came and you got all freaked out.Blah, blah, blah.I appreciate your sympathy.Im sympathetic.I just think youre making a mistake.You didnt say that last Sunday.Well, Ive had a chance to think about it.And on that note, thanks for keeping me in the dark about the stalker until then.Her voice dripped sarcasm, but Maria couldnt really blame her.I didnt know for sure until then.And when you did find out?Colin was right there, trying to get answers.He was doing way more than that.Would you rather date the kind of guy who does nothing?Who would sit there like a log?Or would you have wanted him to take charge of the situation?Hell, if Id been there, I would probably have yelled at that dingbat waitress, too.Who cant remember what someone looks like a few minutes after theyve ordered a drink?I saw a side of Colin that I didnt like.So what?Do you think that Mom hasnt seen a side of Dad that she doesnt like?Or vice versa?Ive seen a side of you that I dont like, but I didnt shut you out of my life.What side?Does it matter?Yes.Fine.You always think youre right.It bugs me.No, I dont.Youre making my point.And youre beginning to irritate me.Someones got to keep you in line and tell you when youre wrong.And on that note, youre wrong about Colin, too.You should call him.Hes good for you.Im not so sure of that.Then why did you insist that we come watch him fight tonight?Why had she wanted to come tonight?Shed waffled, telling Serena that shed promised Colin that she would, but Serena had merely scoffed.Just admit that you still like him, shed said.Last weekend, it had been clear that she needed some space to think.Her whipsawing emotions  about the stalker, about Colin  had left her feeling wildly off kilter, a feeling that only grew worse as the week wore on.Even the atmosphere at work felt odd to her.Ken had been in and out of Barneys office most of the week, looking distracted and worried, though he didnt so much as mumble a single word to her.Barney was equally tense; both he and Ken werent in the offices at all on Thursday, and when Lynn didnt show up for work on either Thursday or Friday, shed expected Barney to raise hell as soon as he returned, if only because Lynn hadnt so much as called to say she wouldnt be coming in.However, Barney had simply added Lynns work to Marias plate without explanation or comment.Strange.Her parents, too, were a concern.Still grieving over Copo, her dad was depressed to the point that hed stopped going in to the restaurant, and her mom was worried about him.Maria had dinner with them on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, Serena on Monday and Wednesday, and on the way to Colins fight, theyd both agreed that something needed to be done, even if they werent quite sure if there was anything they could do.The fight was supposed to be a distraction, or at least thats what shed tried to tell herself.Serena, too.But as soon as Colin had stepped into the cage, shed felt an almost nauseating wave of butterflies coupled with an acute sense of regret.All of which meant what?With her parents grieving, the idea of begging off their usual Sunday brunch was out of the question, even if she didnt feel as though she was in the right frame of mind to support anyone.Which was why the sight of Serena on the front porch, almost vibrating with expectant energy, caught Maria off guard.As soon as Maria pulled into the drive, Serena skipped over.Whats going on?I know what we have to do, Serena said.And I have no idea why it took this long to figure it out, other than that Im an idiot!On the plus side, you and I are going to get our lives back I mean, I love Mom and Dad, but I cant keep coming over here for dinner a couple of times a week and having brunch on Sunday.I already have to spend time with them at the restaurant, and I need at least a little space, you know?What are you talking about?Ive thought of something to help Mom and Dad.Maria stepped out of the car.How are they?Not great.This should be interesting.Like I said, I have a plan.It took some coaxing, but despite their reservations, Marias parents werent the kind to say no to their kids, especially when the girls were united in their pleas.Climbing into their dads SUV, they drove to the Humane Society.When they reached the parking lot of the low slung, nondescript building, Maria couldnt help noticing how her parents dragged their feet, reluctance written in their every step.Its too soon, their mother had protested when Serena first introduced the idea.Well just see whats available, Serena had reassured them.No pressure.Now they trailed behind their daughters, moving slowly toward the doors.Im not so sure this is a good idea, Maria hissed, leaning closer to Serena.What if they dont have a dog here that he likes?Remember how I told you that Steve volunteers here?Well, after I told him about Copo, Steve mentioned that theres one dog that just might be perfect, Serena whispered back.He even agreed to meet us here.Did you ever consider getting him another shih tzu?From the same breeder where they got Copo?Of course I did, Serena said.But I didnt want them to think we were trying to replace Copo.Isnt that exactly what were doing?Not if its a different kind of dog.Maria wasnt as confident in Serenas logic as her sister obviously was, but she said nothing.Steve, looking visibly nervous, greeted them as soon as they entered.After Serena offered him a hug, she introduced him to her parents.Steve eagerly led them into the back, toward the kennels.Dogs immediately began to bark, the sound echoing off the walls.They walked slowly past the first few kennels  there was a Lab mix, a pit bull mix, and some sort of terrier  and she noted her parents apathy.Ahead of them, Serena and Steve stopped at one of the smaller kennels.How about this one?Serena called out.Felix and Carmen headed over to her, moving reluctantly, like theyd rather be anywhere else.Maria trailed in their wake.What do you think?Serena pressed.In the kennel, Maria saw a small black and brown dog with a face like a teddy bears, sitting on its haunches, making no noise at all.Maria had to admit that it was just about the cutest thing shed ever seen.Hes a shorkie tzu, Steve offered.Its a mix between a shih tzu and a Yorkshire terrier.Hes very sweet and between two and three years old.Steve opened the kennel; reaching in, he picked up the dog and offered it to Felix.Would you mind carrying him outside?Hed probably love some fresh air.With a trace of lingering reluctance, Felix cradled the dog; Carmen leaned in curiously.Maria watched as the little dog licked her fathers fingers before yawning with a squeak.Within minutes, Felix was in love, as was Carmen.Serena stood by watching them, holding Steves hand, clearly pleased with herself.Not that Maria could blame her.No wonder shed been short listed for the scholarship; Serena was sometimes absolutely brilliant.When Maria returned to work on Monday, the tension in the office was palpable.Everyone was on edge, paralegals whispering to each other over the partitions of their cubicles, growing silent whenever any of the attorneys approached; meanwhile, Maria learned that all the partners had been closeted in the conference room since the very early morning, which could only signify that something major was brewing.Lynn was absent for the third consecutive workday, and with no idea what she was supposed to do  Barney had neglected to leave her any instructions  Maria poked her head into Jills office.Before she could get a word out, Jill began shaking her head and talking loudly enough to be heard in the hallway.Of course were still on for lunch, Jill announced.I cant wait to hear about your weekend!It sounds amazing!The partners were still behind closed doors when Maria finally took a seat across the table from Jill at a nearby restaurant.What in the world is going on today?Its like some sort of twilight zone back there!And what are the partners talking about?No one seems to know anything.Jill expelled a long breath.Its all very hush hush right now but Im sure youve noticed the absence of your paralegal?Does she have something to do with whats going on?You could say that, Jill muttered, trailing off when the waiter approached to take their drink orders.She waited until the waiter had walked away before speaking again.Well get to that, she said.And Ill answer what I can.Mainly, I wanted to have lunch with you because I wanted to run something by you in confidence.Yeah, of course Maria said.Are you happy working at the firm?Im doing okay.Why?Because I was wondering if youd ever consider leaving and coming to work with me at my own firm.Maria was too stunned to formulate an answer.Jill nodded.I know its a big decision, and you dont need to give me an answer right now.But I want you to think about it.Especially now, given whats going on.I still dont know whats going on.And wait Youre leaving?Weve been working on our plans since before you started here.We?Ill be working with Leslie Shaw.Shes an employment attorney with Scanton, Dilly and Marsden, and we went to law school together.Shes terrific, sharp as a tack, and shrewd when it comes to labor law.Id like you to meet her if youre open to the idea of maybe coming to work with us.Youd have to like her, of course but if you have no desire to leave, then I hope youll forget I said anything at all.For now, were trying to keep this as quiet as possible.I wont say anything, Maria promised, the shock still reverberating.And of course Id be willing to meet her, but why are you thinking about leaving?Because our firm is in trouble.Like, Titanic hitting the iceberg trouble, and the next few months arent going to be pretty.What do you mean?Our managing partner, Ken, is about to get sued by Lynn for sexual harassment.And Im guessing that two, maybe even three other paralegals are also going to sue.Thats what the partners have been meeting about all day.Because its going to make the news and its going to be ugly.From what I heard, the private mediation didnt go well last week.What mediation?Last Thursday.Which explains why Lynn, Barney, and Ken were absent Why havent I heard anything about this?Because Lynn hasnt filed with the EEOC yet.Then why was there a mediation at all?Because Ken was warned about it a couple weeks back and has been doing everything he can to head it off.Youve noticed, Im sure, that hes been on his best behavior since then.Hes terrified.Im sure he expects the firm to negotiate a settlement, and Im sure the other partners are balking at that.They want Ken to make it go away, but he doesnt have the money.How can he not have the money?Two ex wives?And this isnt the first time its happened.Ken has settled before.Thats why I used to ask you about him.Because youre young and attractive and you work in the office, which is all it takes, as far as Ken is concerned.The guy does all his thinking from below the waist.And, of course, Lynn will claim that the partners were all in cahoots with him, since they knew exactly what kind of guy he was and never did anything about it.The firm could be staring at a multimillion dollar payout and lets just say that a lot of clients arent going to want to be associated with a firm known for rampant sexual harassment.Which brings me back to my original question: Are you open to the idea of joining Leslie and me at a new firm?Maria was overwhelmed.I dont have employment law experience  I understand, but Im not worried.Youre smart and driven, and youll pick up on it faster than you probably imagine.The one caveat is that were probably not going to be able to match your salary from the get go, but youll have more flexible hours, and just by joining on day one youd be on the fast track to becoming a partner.When are you thinking of leaving?Four weeks from Friday, she said.Weve already leased and furnished an office a few blocks from here; all the paperwork is filed.Im sure there are others out there who are much more qualified.So why me?Why not you?Jill smiled.Were friends, and if Ive learned one thing in this profession, its that work is a lot more enjoyable when you like the people you spend your days with.Ive had enough of Ken and Barney to last a lifetime, thank you very much.Im flattered.So youll think about it?Assuming you and Leslie hit it off?I dont see why I wouldnt.Whats Leslie like?The partners finally filed out of the conference room around three p. m. , all of them looking grim.Barney immediately holed up in his office, clearly in no mood to talk.The same went for the other partners; one by one, office doors were closed.Like most of the employees, Maria decided to leave a few minutes early, and on her way out she noted that the remaining staff members acted both nervous and scared.Jill had called her again after speaking with Leslie and confirmed plans for the three of them to have lunch on Wednesday.Jills enthusiasm was infectious, but the upheaval was also causing Maria some trepidation.Changing jobs, changing her practice area (again), and joining a start up still felt risky to her, even if staying here suddenly seemed even riskier.What she really wanted, she realized, was to talk to someone other than Serena or her parents.Climbing into her car, she found herself driving past Evans house and the gym, searching for Colins car before winding her way to Wrightsville Beach.The bar at Crabby Petes was mostly empty.She was climbing onto a stool before Colin finally noticed her, and she watched his surprise slowly give way to something more reserved.Hi, Colin, she said quietly.Its good to see you.Im surprised youre here.Staring at him standing behind the bar, she thought to herself that he was one of the handsomest men shed ever met, and felt the same pang of regret she had on Saturday night.She sighed.Im not.The bar was a good place to talk; the physical barrier between them and the fact that Colin was working kept the conversation from becoming too serious too quickly.Colin briefed her on the fight with Reese and Evans insistence that the whole thing had been rigged.Maria told him about the dog theyd helped their parents adopt, along with the crisis at the firm and her new career opportunity with Jill.As was typical, he listened without interruption; as always, she had to draw out his explanations and thoughts; but when the time came for her to leave, he asked a waiter to cover for him for a few minutes so he could walk her to her car.He didnt try to kiss her, and when she realized he wasnt going to, she leaned in and kissed him.As she tasted the familiar warmth of his mouth, she found herself wondering why shed felt it necessary to take a break from him in the first place.At home, the exhaustion of the day finally taking its toll, she fell asleep quickly.She woke to a text from Colin that thanked her for coming by and told her that hed missed her.Tuesday, the mood at the office was worse than it had been on Monday.While the partners seemed determined to act in a business as usual kind of way, the withholding of information was wearing on everyone else.There was little question that most of the office had begun to imagine the worst, and rumors began to fly.Maria heard whispers about layoffs  many of the employees had families and mortgages, which meant that their lives might just become a lot more complicated.Maria did her best to keep her head down and concentrate on work; Barney remained quiet and distracted.The necessity for focus made the hours pass quickly, and when she finally left the office, she realized she hadnt thought about the stalker at all.She wondered whether that was good or bad.On Wednesday, the lunch with Leslie and Jill went even better than Maria could have hoped.Leslie was in many respects a perfect complement to her best friend in the office  just as lively and irreverent, but also nurturing and thoughtful.The idea of working side by side with them began to seem too good to be true.After lunch, when Jill popped over to report that Leslie had been equally enthusiastic about the meeting, Maria felt a wave of relief.Jill also walked her through their basic offer, including her salary, which was significantly lower, but at this point Maria didnt care.She would adjust her lifestyle accordingly.Im excited, she told Jill.She wondered what  if anything  she should reveal about her stalker or the fact that she and Colin were tentatively back together, and then she realized that she hadnt even mentioned the fact that theyd been broken up.Too much happening all at once.Meanwhile, at Martenson, Hertzberg & Holdman, the black cloud that had descended on the office grew steadily darker, and as she and Jill approached her office, Jill leaned toward her.Dont be surprised if you hear something major tomorrow, she warned.Indeed, on Thursday morning, word raced through the office that Lynn had filed with the EEOC.Ken again was a no show.Though the report was supposed to be confidential, in an office of high powered attorneys with favors to call in, it was soon on virtually everyones computer.Joining the crowd, Maria read through the EEOC charges, which spelled out all the lurid details.The report recounted in blunt and highly specific, often sexual language Kens numerous and unwanted advances, including his promises of career advancement and a higher salary in exchange for specific sexual favors.Employees, their worst fears now confirmed, were moving around in a daze.Maria and Jill escaped the office, heading to lunch at their usual time, and discussed when to announce that theyd be leaving the firm.Maria leaned toward the idea of letting Barney know sooner rather than later so he wouldnt be caught in a bind  maybe within a few days.Hes demanding, but hes also been fair and Ive learned a lot from him, Maria said.And I have no desire to make things even worse for him.Thats a valid point  and its thoughtful  but it might backfire.Im wondering if we should let the dust settle first.Why?Because once you and I announce that were leaving, it might set off an exodus of other attorneys, which could lead to a death spiral.We announce, then others do, then clients leave, and the next thing you know, even people who were willing to stick around might find themselves out of work.Im sure a lot of people are already considering their options.Im sure.I would.But thats not the same as actually resigning.In the end, they compromised on two weeks from Friday, leaving Barney with a short window to find a replacement.From there, the conversation moved on to the kind of firm they wanted to create  the kinds of cases theyd take on, how theyd grow their client base, which of their clients might follow them, how much support staff theyd initially need.On Friday, another bomb went off in the office when word raced through the hallways that Heather, Kens paralegal, and Gwen, the receptionist, had also filed complaints with the EEOC, their statements as damaging as Lynns had been.Once again, the partners closeted themselves behind closed doors, no doubt sending death stares in Kens direction.One by one, associates and staff began leaving the office  some at three, others at four.Exhausted from the week, Maria decided to join them.After all, she was planning to meet Colin later, and needed time to unwind first.I cant imagine how surreal it must have been all week, Colin remarked.Its been awful.A lot of people are angry and scared and practically all of them feel blindsided.They had no idea something like this was coming.They were at the Pilot House again, and though theyd spoken on the phone a couple of times  both of them trying to inch their way back to normal  this was the first time Maria had seen Colin since her visit to Crabby Petes.In his jeans and white button down shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, he looked, impossibly, even better than he had on Monday.Funny, she thought, what even a little time apart could do.And Jill?A total lifesaver.Without her offer, I dont know what I would have done.Its not as though firms are hiring these days, and I probably would have been a basket case.And Jills right.With three employees filing with the EEOC, its pretty certain that even if the firm does find a way to survive, all the partners are going to be on the hook financially and its going to be grim for the next few years.Which probably means theyre upset.Try furious.Im pretty sure that theyd all like nothing better than to strangle Ken.Doesnt the firm have insurance for things like this?Theyre not sure itll cover this.He was clearly breaking the law, and according to the complaints, there are recordings, e mails, texts, and one of the paralegals supposedly even has a video.Not good.No, Maria agreed.There are a lot of innocent people who are going to get hurt by this.I cant tell you how fortunate I am.Okay.Dont start saying that.Colin smiled.Okay.They spent the night rediscovering each other, falling asleep with their limbs intertwined.In the morning, Maria had no regrets and was surprised to catch herself picturing something long term between them.The thought was strangely thrilling.After they spent Saturday together flying kites at the beach, the feeling only continued to grow.On Saturday night, she had dinner with Jill and Leslie while Colin worked; after his shift ended, they met at his place.Evan and Lily were there, and the four of them talked until past three in the morning.Unable to stay awake a minute longer, Colin and Maria didnt make love until the following morning.Though she invited him to brunch, Colin begged off with his apologies, citing a number of upcoming exams he had to study for before working another shift that evening.When she arrived at her parents home, she was pleased to learn that Smokey  the name her parents had chosen for the dog  now had his own rhinestone collar, bed, and various toys strewn throughout the living room, but he seemed most content when snuggled against her father.In the kitchen, Carmen couldnt stop humming.For her part, Serena talked more about Steve than she ever had before.Okay, maybe its getting a little serious, she admitted, eventually submitting to her mothers grilling.At the table, it was Felixs turn to ask about Steve, and all Maria could do was smile.Between her career, her family, and now Colin, things were on the way up.As they cleared the table, Maria realized again that she was no longer obsessing about the man in the baseball hat, partly because of everything else going on, but also because thered been no sign of him lately.She wanted to think hed given up  that hed finished rattling her cage.But as much as shed enjoyed the temporary reprieve, she wasnt yet ready to believe it was completely over.Before a rainbow, after all, theres usually a storm.The weather was too cool to paddleboard, and since Colin was occupied, Maria spent the rest of the afternoon and evening trying to catch up on office work.With Lynn absent and Barney operating at less than full capacity, the fact that shed be leaving in three weeks made her feel a bit guilty.Not guilty enough to change her mind, but enough to keep her at the MacBook until her documents became a blur and writing became pointless.When she awoke the next morning, Maria found herself wondering about the coming week  how much worse the mood at the office was going to be  and whether anyone else had made the decision to leave.Most of the partners were as distracted as Barney and Ken, which meant work was probably backlogged in every department, and making new hires was going to be tough once word of the firms troubles leaked out.No doubt it already had.For now, she resolved to make her own departure as painless for Barney as possible.Hitching her purse over her shoulder, she grabbed her briefcase and headed out the door, her eyes flashing to the doormat.It took a moment to process what she was seeing before her breath caught in her throat.A wilted rose, with petals turning black, along with a note.You will know how it feels.Almost like she was dreaming, her feet remained rooted to the doorstep, because she knew there would be more.On the railing near the steps was another rotting rose that drooped under the weight of another card.Willing her feet to move forward, she stepped over the flower on her doormat and moved closer to read:  Why did you hate her?
