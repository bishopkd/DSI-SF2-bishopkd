I love Cordero Vineyards.To hell with riding across the country.I want to stay in Rainbow Valley forever.Im really glad youre coming away with me, he said.Were going to have such a good time.Such a good time.Didnt he know how much she wanted them to be more than just traveling friends with benefits?After Shannon and Luke left on their honeymoon and the caterer had cleaned up, Marc made his way back up to the house with Nina.Daniel and Angela walked behind them, talking to each other but acting as if Marc didnt exist.Marc opened the back door to find Kari already in the kitchen, putting the finishing touches on dinner.Nina helped Kari set the table and bring the food to the dining room, and they all sat down to eat.The tension in the room felt as heavy as sludge in the bottom of a fermentation tank, and Marc wished he was anywhere else.It was a nice wedding, wasnt it?Nina said as she passed the green beans around the table.Beautiful, Kari said.Nina turned to Angela.What did you think?She shrugged.It was okay.Id love to see you get married under that arbor someday.Assuming we still have a vineyard for me to get married in.She stabbed her fork into a chunk of chicken.Marc felt stress working its way between his shoulders, and he had to bite his tongue bloody to keep from snapping back.Chickens good, Daniel said as he ate, because nothing on earth got in the way of his appetite.Thanks, Kari said.I found a recipe in that old Betty Crocker cookbook in the pantry.Angela flicked her gaze to Kari.That cookbook was Grandmas.She didnt let anybody touch it.Grandma is dead, so theres no reason not to use it now, Marc said.Otherwise, it just collects dust.Angela pursed her lips and stabbed another bite of chicken.So, Angela, Nina said.Hows school?Oh, crap, Marc thought.Did she have to go there?Fine, Angela said.Daniel looked up.Thats not what you told Marc.If she says its fine, its fine, Marc snapped.More silence, so much that the clinking of silverware sounded like Big Ben chiming the hour.Then all at once, Angela tossed her fork down with a clatter.Its not fine, she said.Oh, God, Marc thought.Here it comes.Im not crazy enough for Kim and her friends, and Im not cool enough to pledge a sorority.So where does that leave me?Nowhere.Who the hell cares?Marc said.Didnt I teach you not to follow the crowd?That gives me no one to hang out with.And everybody laughs at me.Why would they laugh at you?Marc said.Because Im from some dinky little town most of them have never heard of.And they say I talk funny.Arent they Texans, too?Nina asked.Most of them are.But it turns out big city Texans talk different than small town Texans.I try not to talk like I talk, but Ive been talking this way for eighteen years, so I dont know how else to do it.All that will change, Nina said.No, it wont.That place is so big, and I just dont fit in.Well, youll just have to learn to fit in, Marc said.I dont want to fit in.I dont even want to go back.Silence fell over the table.No, he said carefully, trying like hell not to blow up.Youre going back to school.Angela was silent.Ive paid for this semester, and youre going to finish it.No, Im not.I hate that place!What are you talking about?Youre not dropping out!What do you care?Youre not even going to be here!With that, Angela pushed her chair back and leaped up from the table, heading for the stairs.Then all at once she came back to the kitchen.I dont suppose I could actually go to my own room, could I?Yeah, Marc said.Its all yours again.Angela looked at Kari.But that means that shes She looked heavenward.Oh, God.As she stomped up the stairs, Marc flung his napkin down and stood up, scraping his chair across the floor.Enough of this.He was going to go have a word with her right now.Marc, Nina said.He kept moving.Marc!He turned back.Dont you get it?Nina said.What?Shes having a hard time at school.She could probably get through that, except shes not going to have a father to come home to when things get tough.Thats what shes trying to tell you.She knew I was leaving.She thought it was fine.Its one thing to talk about it.Its another thing when she sees you on the verge of doing it.Marc swallowed hard, the truth slowly coming to him.Was this what his leaving was going to do to his daughter?Suddenly he felt sick.The plans hed been making for years, the ones he thought were set in concrete, were suddenly shifting like sand beneath his feet.Shes just a kid, he said.Everything seems tough to handle when youre a kid, right?Shell get over it.Yeah?How about me?Will I have to get over it, too?What are you talking about?For some reason he didnt understand, tears filled Ninas eyes.What was going on now?You cant just leave like this, she said.Nina, Marc said carefully.Weve talked about this.Everything is going to be fine.Daniel will be here.But he didnt believe things were going to be fine.Not for one second.So why was he saying it?Because he couldnt leave unless it was true.I know hell be here, but Nina waved her hand, a single tear coursing down her cheek.You wont be.Marc couldnt believe this.Nina was about as self sufficient as any woman hed ever known, and now she was falling apart on him, too?Nina, he said.Its okay.Its not as if Ill be gone forever.Is that really true?Youve told metold all of usthat theres a chance youll decide not to come back to Rainbow Valley.What are we supposed to do then?Have you even stopped to think about what your leaving means to everyone else?Or are you just going to get onto that motorcycle and drive away as if you dont give a damn about anybody?Marc drew back, anger surging through him.Dont give a damn about anybody?Are you serious?Almost everything Ive done for the past eighteen years has been for somebody else.For once in my life, Im doing something for me.And dont you dare make me feel like shit for doing it!I have to go, Nina said.She rose from the table, spun around, and left the room.The front door opened, then closed.Oh, boy, Daniel said.Oh, boy is right, Marc said.I cant believe she went off on me like that!Well, there is kind of a reason why, Daniel said.What reason?I cant say.She swore me to silence for today.Hey!If theres something that explains that, youd better start talking!Daniel sighed.Manfred died this morning.Silence fell over the table, and Marc felt as if somebody had punched him in the stomach.My God.Why didnt you tell me?She didnt want anybody to know.Why not?Luke and Shannons wedding.She wanted their day to be perfect, and if they knew, she thought theyd be all worried about her.Marc dropped his head to his hands.Shit.Then he jerked his head up.He took off toward the front door, trying to catch Nina, but she was already gone.He pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed her number.She didnt answer.Kari came to the entryway.She should have said something, Marc said.She should have told me.Luke and Shannon didnt have to know.I know.But I think she knew how Shannon in particular would feel if she found out.Manfred came from the shelter.I guess she just didnt want to chance it.And what about Angela?If she drops out of college Marc exhaled.God, Kari.Do you have any idea how smart she is?I can only imagine.Well, imagine times ten.Thats what shes throwing away.I know you think the worst thing in the world is for her not to go to college.Its not.The worst thing in the world is for her to think you dont approve of her.Hey!Ive never made her think that.Never!You didnt have to.Unless I miss my guess, shes always done what you wanted her to.What was there for you to disapprove of?Kari put her hand on his sleeve.Have you thought about sending her to another school?Yes.Of course I have.But shed need to go to another state school, or I wouldnt be able to afford it.The others might not be as big as the University of Texas, but theyre still big schools.Im not sure that would solve the problem.If she sticks it out where she is, she could still adjust and everything will be fine.She could.But if time passes and shes still miserable  I know, Marc said, blowing out a breath.I know.Just talk to her.Itll be okay.He turned and looked up the stairs.I will.But Nina first.I have to fix this.Im going to her house.He started out the door, only to realize he didnt want to deal with this by himself.Maybe this time he didnt have to.He looked back at Kari.Will you come with me?She nodded.Let me get my purse.Marc hated this.He never said the right things at the right time, but he had to try to say something.At least with Kari along, there was a chance he wouldnt make a monumental mistake.But when they drove to Ninas house, she wasnt there, and his frustration hit an all time high.Where the hell could she have gone?he said.Kari looked as lost as he felt.Then all at once her face brightened.I think I know where she is.A few minutes later, Marc and Kari stood on the edge of Rainbow Way near the path leading down to the Overlook.Through the trees, Kari could just make out Nina sitting on the bench, staring out into the valley.God, I hate this, Marc said, putting his hand to his forehead.Shes going to cry, and then Im going to say the wrong stupid ass thing and make everything worse.No, you wont.Oh, believe me.I will.I know this is going to come as a shock to you, but Im not the most sensitive guy in the world.Why dont I go down there and talk to her?Kari said.Marc exhaled.No.Its my responsibility.I need to  You can in a minute.Let me talk to her first.Marc still looked unsure.I promise you itll be okay.Finally he nodded.Kari turned and walked down the brick path.Shed almost reached the park bench before Nina turned around.She had a tissue clutched in her hand.Her eyes were red, and her lashes were wet with tears.Kari sat down beside her.Daniel told us about Manfred.Im so sorry.Nina wiped beneath her eyes with her fingertips.I didnt want to tell anyone.I was so afraid of ruining Shannon and Lukes wedding.But Daniel caught me crying, so I had to tell him.She let out a shaky sigh.It wasnt as if it was a shock.I knew it was coming.But still  Kari nodded.How are you doing now?Not great.She caught a trickle of a tear with a tissue.As long as I had Manfred, it was like Curtis was still here.But now that hes gone, too  Curtis is waiting for him, remember?That was what he promised you.That hed wait for both of you.But I have to wait so long, Nina said, her voice a hushed whisper.So long.And I miss Manfred so much.Its only been a few hours, and already I dont know what to do without him.Kari didnt really know what to say to that, so she didnt say anything.Ill be fine, Nina said finally.Life goes on, you know?I just have to feel sorry for myself for a little while.Kari slipped her arm around Ninas shoulders.Together they looked into the valley, watching as the sun slipped below the horizon.Then Ninas voice broke the silence.Marc is crazy about you, you know.Hearing those words made Kari want to cry herself.She was desperate to say, Do you really think so?Do you think theres any way on this earth hell ever love me?But she couldnt.The more she wished for it, the more painful it was going to be when it never happened.We have a good time together, she told Nina.But thats all.Ive been hoping you might be able to get him to stay.Actually, he thinks I ought to go with him when he leaves.Nina blinked with surprise.Are you going to?I dont want to leave Rainbow Valley.I really love it here.But Kari sighed, feeling that impossible push pull all over again.Ill follow him anywhere, Nina.Anywhere he wants to go.Youre in love with him.Kari closed her eyes.Please dont tell him that.But its true?He has Angela to think about, and shes not happy about him seeing me.He says that doesnt bother him, but I know it does.And I know he doesnt want anything that even looks like commitment.I wouldnt be so sure.He wants freedom.I know, Nina said.But what we want and what we needsometimes theyre not the same thing.But Kari knew how strong minded Marc was.If he was convinced he was right about something, getting him to change his mind was damned near impossible.Ill probably get another puppy soon, Nina said.Yeah?Kari said.I dont feel like it now, but I know eventually I will.Shannon never has a shortage at the shelter.Itd be a shame not to adopt one.Kari nodded.But Ill never get married again.Are you sure about that?I believe in soul mates.That theres one man a woman is destined to be with.For me, Curtis was that man.I already gave my heart away to him, and I dont ever want it back.So how could I give it away to another man?Kari couldnt imagine what it would be like to love a man with all her heart and soul the way Nina loved Curtis.And all at once an image popped into Karis mind of her own heart slowly slipping away from her, but when she turned around, Marc was holding it in the palm of his hand.If only that could happen someday.She and Marc.Together.If only  Stop wishing for what you cant have!Nina looked past Kari to the head of the path, where Marc sat on a bench looking uncomfortable.Poor Marc.He has no idea what to say, does he?Not a clue, Kari said.But I dont have to tell you how much he cares about you.I know he does.And Im sorry I went off on him like that, because he has a right to leave, you know?I just dont know what were all going to do without him.Would you like us to walk with you back to your car?Kari asked.Nina nodded.She rose and walked with Kari back up the path.Marc stood up when he saw them coming.Kari could tell he still didnt know what to say.But when Nina drew closer, he simply stepped forward, pulled her into his arms, and gave her a heartfelt hug.Im sorry for what I said, Nina told him.Forget it, Marc said.Nina began to cry again.Tears streamed down her face and soaked into Marcs shirt, but he just kept holding her like that, rubbing his hand up and down her back.Marc might not always say the right thing, but he always did the right thing.By the time they got back to the vineyard, Angela had returned to college.Daniels car was gone, which meant hed left the house.If history was any indication, hed probably spend the night in some womans bed and wouldnt be back until morning.They went to Marcs bedroom, and by the time Kari came out of the bathroom, he was in bed, the light switched off, his arm resting across his forehead as he stared at the ceiling.She crawled in beside him, pulling her pillow over to lie on her side next to him.Whats wrong?she asked.Well, lets see.Nina is lost without Curtis and hates the thought of me leaving.Angela doesnt like college, so shes probably going to drop out.And Daniel wants to wait a week to harvest.I think thats too late, but were stuck with that decision now, because he went behind my back and rescheduled the crew.This is harvest season in the Hill Country, and now I cant get one out here sooner.This whole vintage could go to hell.He exhaled.And its all because Im leaving.Kari could feel the tension radiating from Marc, the frustration, the sense that things were going wrong and he just didnt know how to make them right.I have a right to go, Marc said.I know you do, Kari said.Do you have any idea how hard it was to raise a baby with everything else I had to do?She couldnt even imagine.I used to take Angela into the vineyard with me in a carry cradle and hope she didnt cry because I was too damned dirty to pick her up.And then Id go to the house at night and collapse, praying she would sleep through the night because I was so bone tired I could barely get out of bed.But the next morning I shook it off and got up again, and somehow I made it through another day.I loved her, Kari.I always have, more than anything in my life.But when Nicole left, I couldnt help feeling as if Id gotten the short end of the stick.Sometimes I just wanted to scream, But what about me?I know.That sounds so selfish.No!No, it doesnt sound selfish.Youre not selfish.God, Marc, youre the least selfish person I know.My father would have told me just to knock off the whining, gut it up, and do it.So that was what I did.So he was pretty tough?He was a hard man.Blunt.Demanding.But he had a work ethic second to no one, and when he gave his word, it was law.Not everybody liked my father, but there wasnt anybody anywhere who didnt respect him.In the near darkness of the bedroom, Kari saw Marcs throat convulse in a heavy swallow.Ill never forget the night I told him Nicole was pregnant.He got really quiet.Really still.His eyes went cold as ice.And then he said, I counted on you to be smarter than that.Marcs eyes drifted closed at the memory.Kari couldnt have imagined a man like Marc not meeting any parents expectations, but she could tell by the look on his face that even if he lived to be a thousand, that feeling of inadequacy would always be there.A month before Angela was born, Marc said, he dropped dead right out there among the vines.A heart attack.He was here one second, gone the next.That fast.Gone before I could show him that even though Id made a mistake, he could still believe in me.And Marc had been trying to live up to his fathers expectations ever since.Keeping this place running.Holding his family together no matter what.Raising his daughter.Being everything to everyone because there was nobody else to do it.I was scared to death, Marc said.I was just a kid, trying to make everything work.Sometimes I wanted to hide my head and pretend none of it was happening.I wanted to go off to college the way Angela did.Maybe thats why it makes me so crazy that shes not even sure she likes it there.She has the opportunity I never had, and she doesnt even realize how special it is.He turned and put his arm around Kari, pulling her against him.He kissed her hair, then held her tightly.Youre the only one who doesnt ask anything of me.Whenever Im with you, its because I want to be, not because I have to be.It seems as if my whole life has been have to.I didnt even know what want to felt like until you came along.A wave of despair came over Kari, making her desperate to tell him how she felt about him.She loved him so much she ached with it.The words were on the tip of her tongue, fighting to get out, but she swallowed them at the last second.He loved this place.And he loved his family.But hed never given her any indication that he loved her.That would lead to a relationship, which would involve the kind of responsibility he was telling her he wanted nothing to do with.Hadnt he said it?She was his want to.The moment she put any restrictions on him, demanded anything from him, became one more of his have tos  Shed lose him.Later after Marc was asleep, Kari lay awake in the dark, worry eating away at her.He wanted so desperately to leave, but she had to agree with Nina.She wasnt sure it would truly make him happy.But Kari hadnt been lying.If Marc wanted to fly to the moon, shed find a way to crawl into that space capsule with him.But there was a problem with that.Maybe a big problem.How could she cross this country on a motorcycle with Marc if she got sick every time she got on one?If it was all she could have of him, that was what she wanted.But if going with him wasnt going to be an option, shed have to say good bye.And the thought of that was absolutely intolerable.But speaking of sick  Ever since dinner, shed felt a little woozy.Maybe it was leftover motion sickness from the ride home.But how could that be?As the minutes passed, the feeling grew more intense until she felt as if she was going to throw up.A shadow of a thought worked its way into her mind.It faded, then came back even stronger.She shook it away again, but finally she couldnt ignore it.She put her hand to her stomach, and for a moment she couldnt breathe.Was it possible?Oh, God.Maybe it wasnt the motorcycle after all.The next afternoon, Daniel avoided Marc, walking the other way when he saw him coming, and Marc knew it was going to take every bit of self control he had not to grab his brother by the collar and tell him what a fool he was.Marc felt as if he wasnt in control of anything anymore.He usually loved this time of year, when the vineyard was the most beautiful.But looking at it now, all he saw was a disaster waiting to happen.It was only two in the afternoon, but he decided hed go inside, take a shower, and wait for Kari to get home.She was off today, but shed been gone all morning.Where, he didnt know, but as soon as she came back he wanted to talk to her.He felt as if his life was crashing in on him from all sides, as if his dream was slipping away, and he didnt know what to do to make it stop.He only knew if he could talk to her, things wouldnt seem so insurmountable.He took a shower, which didnt make him feel remotely better.Then he went to his bedroom and got dressed.He sat down on the bed for a moment, dropping his head to his hands with a heavy sigh.Then he heard footsteps, and Kari appeared at the door.She paused there for a moment, then came into the bedroom, tossed her purse aside, and sat down next to him on the bed.Im glad youre home, he said.I had some errands, she said quietly.Whats wrong?Daniel is still avoiding me.If this vintage is anything but total crap, itll be a miracle of God.He wont listen to you?He never has before.Why would I think this time would be any different?Kari nodded solemnly.So are you thinking about staying?He wasnt sure what he heard in her voice.Disappointment?Probably.After all, hed promised her they were leaving there.Getting on the road, just the two of them.Feeling crazy and free without a care in the world.To her, life was one big adventure, and that was what hed promised her.Now it sounded as if he was returning to the man he used to be, the one who took life so damned seriously to the exclusion of everything else.Then all at once, he had a moment of clarity he hadnt anticipated.In the past several weeks, hed learned what it felt like to color outside the lines, and it was because of Kari.Shed taught him to be spontaneous.To look forward to tomorrow and all the fun they were going to have.Shed given herself to him in ways a woman never had before, with total and complete abandon.Shed made him realize there was another side of life hed never experienced, one he craved now with everything he had in him.Not only was it what hed promised her, it was what hed promised himself.Wasnt breaking out of that mold exactly what hed always wanted?What he deserved after being Mr.Responsibility all these years?No, he said.No matter what happens here, were going anyway.Her face fell.Are you sure?He frowned.You sound like my family.I thought you wanted to do this.I do.Its just thatwell, are you sure you want to?Yes.Of course Im sure.As soon as harvest is over, were getting on my motorcycle and leaving.Its what Ive dreamed of all these years, and now that its almost here, Im not giving it up.I know I said Im worried about the vineyard.But Daniel already rescheduled the crew, and I couldnt get one here any earlier if I wanted to.I cant change it, so why fight it?What about Nina and Angela?Theyll have to learn to stand on their own two feet.I just dont want you to regret leaving.Im not going to regret anything.Maybe you should wait, she said.Get through harvest this year.Let things with Angela settle down.And Nina  No!It has to be now.Now or never.Nothing is going to stand in our way.Once harvest is over, were leaving.Marc  Isnt that what you want?What we both want?I I dont know.Kari?Are you backing out on me?No!Its not that.Its  Good.Because its going to be great.Just the two of us together on the open road.We can do whatever we want, whenever we want.Nobody needing us, nobody depending on us  Marc!Will you stop talking?Please.Just stop!Her face crumpled, as if she was on the verge of crying.He looked at her with confusion.Whats wrong?I cant say it.I just She dropped her head to one hand.Kari?When she looked up again, tears filled her eyes.Im pregnant.17    The moment Kari spoke the words, Marc felt as if a frigid wind had swept across the room and knocked him flat on his back.He stared at Kari, unable to speak, unable to breathe, praying time would stop and he wouldnt have to hear another word.Wishing he could go back in time five minutesjust five minutesand play this all again, only this time she wouldnt say those words and his life wouldnt be crashing down on him.How do you know?he finally managed to say.If youre just late  I went to the doctor this morning.Is there any chance shes wrong?No, Kari said.Theres no doubt.Oh, God.This could not be happening.The baby, he said by rote, not looking at her.Is everything okay?Yes.The doctor says everything is fine.You?Just a little morning sickness.He dropped his head to his hands.A few seconds later, he felt a surge of frustration and jerked it back up again.How the hell did this happen?The usual way.We used protection.Its not a hundred percent.Its damned close if you use it right!We did.You know we did.Sometimes things justhappen.No, Kari.This doesnt just happen.No man on earth has this kind of shitty luck!Then he thought about the condom that first time theyd been together in the cottage.Expired.Only two months, though.Two months.They were good for years.Years.Could that little time have possibly made a difference?In spite of his history, he hadnt continued to worry about it because he was a logical man and it just wasnt logical to get uptight about those kinds of odds.He didnt think there had been an obvious problem with it, but he was so damned distracted, so caught up in having sex for the first time in forever  So damned irresponsible.Marc couldnt stand it.He couldnt stand that feeling of history repeating itself, that stomach churning feeling of his life coming to a screeching halt.I knew youd be upset, Kari said carefully.And you have a right to be.Hell yes, I have a right to be!She shrank away as if hed slapped her, but he couldnt say anything to mitigate his words.This was it.The one thing hed feared the most.Being tied down for the next two decades.I know how you feel about this, but  No, Kari, you dont.You dont have a clue how I feel about this.Yes.I do.Ive listened to you.Ive heard you say it over and over.I know how important it is for you to finally be able to live your own life.But if we just talk about it  Not now.I cant right now.But  I said I cant talk about it.You blame me for this, dont you?Maybe he did.Maybe he blamed her for being a crazy woman who left her own wedding and ended up on his doorstep that rainy night.If she hadnt done that, none of this would be happening.The irony overwhelmed him.The woman whod made him feel free for the first time in years was the one tying him down all over again.But she wasnt the only one at fault.Hadnt he known what might happen?Hadnt he known?His fathers voice echoed inside his head all over again.I counted on you to be smarter than that.No.I blame myself.Could I have been a bigger fool?He couldnt sit there any longer.Not with Kari looking at him like that, needing him to say things he couldnt, to tell her things were going to be all right, because right then he wasnt sure they were.He rose from the bed, grabbed a bag from his closet, and tossed it on the bed.What are you doing?Kari asked.He threw a change of clothes in it.Marc?I have to get out of here.Get out of here?Ride.Youre leaving?Just for a while.He went into the bathroom and grabbed a few items.What about the vineyard?Kari said when he came back in the room.He dumped the toiletries into his bag.Daniel is here.That was all he could say.He couldnt think any more about that, because his mind was filled to bursting with visions of a future he never thought hed have.He needed to clear his head.Make sense of this.Approach it logically.He needed to think, damn it, and get a plan.Only idiots faced challenges without a plan.But he had no plan this time.None at all.But all he could think about was getting on his motorcycle and putting as much distance between himself and this disaster as he possibly could.He zipped his bag, knowing he was being a bastard for acting this way.But he couldnt even look at Kari.He couldnt face what was going on.He just needed some time.With his life falling apart all around him, his plans destroyed, didnt he at least deserve that?He brushed past her and headed for the bedroom door.Where are you going?she asked.I dont know.When will you be back?Dont ask me that.Marc  He wheeled back around.Dont ask me when Im going to be back!He squeezed his eyes closed, gritting his teeth.He didnt want to be this way.He didnt.But wasnt this how it always was?Answering to everyone?Being pulled ten different directions?Everybody wanting something from him?I went through hell back then, he said, his voice low and intense.Nicole leaving.My parents dying.Raising two teenagers and a baby when I was just a teenager myself.Working in the vineyard until I was ready to drop.I managed only one way.By seeing light at the end of the tunnel.I dont see that light anymore.No, Kari said, shaking her head.Dont you see?Its not going to be like that this time.This is my baby, too.I wouldnt even think about walking away.Do you understand that?Im going to take care of him.Be a mother in every way there is.Yeah?How do you expect to do that?What do you mean?A few weeks ago, you couldnt even put food in your own mouth.She swallowed hard.Ive come a long way since then.And you have a long way to go.I know.And I know its going to be hard, but  Hard?Youre a waitress in a small town caf.You make next to nothing.You work odd hours, and youre exhausted at the end of every shift.Until youve tried to take care of a baby in addition to all that, you dont have a clue what hard is.Im sorry, Kari.But thats the truth.I wont be his only parent.But I cant be sure that I wont.Yes, you can!Didnt I just tell you  Dont you think Nicole told me the same thing?Marc said hotly, his voice escalating.When she told me she was pregnant, she couldnt stop crying.I told her everything was going to be okay.She said she believed me, that she could do it as long as I was with her.But she left anyway.I woke up one morning, and she was gone.She got her freedom.I stayed and took responsibility, because I was raised to believe that no man was a man unless he did.But now this?When in the name of God is it going to be my turn?I would never leave you, she said.Sorry, but you dont have a great track record where not leaving is concerned.Christ, Kari.You walked away from your own wedding!She recoiled as if hed struck her.Should I have stayed and married him?Hell no!But you didnt exactly face the problem head on, did you?Tears filled her eyes.I mean it, Marc.I would never leave you.He knew she meant that right now.But let her deal with one sleepless night after another with a screaming baby, and just how long would she last?How long would it be before he woke up one morning to find himself alone all over again?Looking at her now, he tried to see the woman whod brought him so much pleasure for the past several weeks, but wasnt that what had caused this problem in the first place?If only hed held the hard line hed laid down for himself and kept his hands off her, he wouldnt be in this situation right now.You dont have to worry, he said.Ill be back.And Ill stay, because I dont have any other choice.And twenty years from now, you can bet your last dollar Ill still be here.Is that what you want to hear?She looked at him with a forlorn expression, her eyes glistening with tears.I just want you to be happy.Happy?What chance did he have of that now?I have to go.With that, he threw his bag over his shoulder and walked out the door.Kari was still in Marcs bedroom when she heard the sound of his motorcycle coming up the drive, passing by the house, and then heading for the front gate.She listened, tears bubbling up inside her, until the sound disappeared in the distance and there was nothing but silence.She loved him.God, she loved him so much.Shed almost blurted it out.Shed almost told him she loved him, that shed loved him almost from the beginning, that there was no other man on this earth she could imagine loving more.But he didnt love her.That thought made her even sicker to her stomach than she already felt.If he loved her, he would have swept her into his arms and told her that nothing mattered but the life theyd created and the two of them being together.Instead, hed done just the opposite.Hed run.Shed had a fantasy all the way home from the doctor that shed tell him the news and hed take her in his arms and tell her he loved her and he wanted to raise their baby together.How stupid could she possibly have been?That had been a silly delusion that only a fool would have.And he was right.As long as she was a waitress at Rosies, shed have a hell of a time raising a baby without a tremendous amount of help, and he was going to be the one providing that help.Because of that, he would resent her for the rest of their lives.She thought about the ultrasound photo shed held in her hand as she came into his bedroom to tell him the news.When she saw the look on his face, she was too scared to give it to him, so when he grabbed some things from the bathroom, shed slipped it inside his bag.Now she was regretting that.Would it make things worse than they already were?In the end, hed be back.And she knew hed stay in Rainbow Valley.Be a father to their baby.Even though he was angry right now, she knew hed love their child with everything he had in him.But what would she be to him?Nothing but the mother of his child.The woman whod been fun for a while, then tied him down in exactly the way he feared the most.Feeling miserable, she got dressed to go to work, so preoccupied she barely realized she was doing it.When she went to the kitchen to grab her purse and keys, Daniel was coming through the back door.Where did Marc go?I saw him leave on his motorcycle earlier.She gave him a smile that she hoped looked genuine.He decided to take it for another spin.He might be gone overnight.Wish I could have gone with him, but I have to work.Getting a head start on that new lifestyle, huh?Daniel said as he grabbed a beer from the fridge.Yeah.I guess so.She headed for the back door.Gotta get to work.Kari?She turned back.Yeah?Marc.Just how pissed is he?Daniel didnt look at her as he said it, and suddenly Kari knew that for all his bravado, he hated the fact that they werent getting along.You guys are just having a difference of opinion, she said.He thinks theres only one way.His way.I have a new method of aging the wine thatll pay off big time for this vineyard, and he wont even consider it.He refuses to listen to anyone else.And not just about the vineyard.I want to pay Angelas tuition just to make things easier for him, but he refuses to let me do it even when Ill never miss the money.How stupid is that?Does that really surprise you?No.I just wish hed listen to me once in a while.He popped the cap on the beer and tossed it into the trash.I postponed our harvest crew until next week.I think it was the right decision.But if its not, Im never going to hear the end of it from Marc.She wished she could tell Daniel that in the end, he wasnt going to have to worry about making the right decisions at the vineyard.That he was going to get a reprieve.That Marc would be staying and running the place because he had a baby now and hitting the road on his motorcycle wasnt going to be an option after all.But until she worked this out with Marc, until they came to some kind of understanding that didnt involve him looking at her as if his life had just fallen apart, she couldnt say a word to anyone.The drone of the engine did nothing to drown out Marcs thoughts as he headed down the highway.Where he was going, he didnt know.But as the hours passed, the open road hed dreamed of all these years seemed bleak and empty, and the longer he rode, the more unsettled he felt.He shouldnt have left.He knew that.Not with Kari looking at him like that, needing him to reassure her.But how the hell could he do that when he couldnt even reassure himself?He knew now there was no end to it.His life was never going to be his own.Never.For hours, Marc drove blindly down Highway 28, and as the afternoon became evening, he wasnt even completely sure where he was.Soon he came to a more populated area, where hundreds of acres of farmland became smaller acreages dotted with houses.The speed limit dropped to thirty five, evidence that a town was up ahead.He rounded a bend and came upon a small cinder block motel with a diner attached.A weathered sign out front said, Sunnyside Inn.He slowed his motorcycle and pulled into the parking lot, but it wasnt until he brought it to a halt and stepped off of it that he realized how tired he was.Glancing at his watch, he was surprised to see hed been driving for almost six hours.He went into the office, where a grandmotherly woman ran his credit card and gave him the key to room number 6.He unlocked the door and found a small room that was trying too hard to be cheerful, with blue walls, a flowered bedspread, and cheap art nailed to the walls.He tossed down his bag, then glanced out the window to see a bar and grill a block down the street called Bucks Roadhouse, its red neon sign shining through the dusky evening light.He could stay in this room with nothing but cable TV and his own thoughts for company, or he could go get a bite to eat and a couple of drinks and forget about everything.Five minutes later, Marc walked inside the bar to find a big, dark room lit mostly by neon beer signs and a couple of TVs behind the bar.One wall was filled with nothing but fishing trophies and cow skulls.Country music assaulted his ears, and the smell of deep fried food filled the air.He took a seat at the bar and ordered a burger and a beer from a balding, middle aged guy who just happened to be Buck himself.A couple of young guys with long, shaggy hair and baseball caps sat at the other end of the bar, their hands around beer bottles and their eyes glued to a monster truck rally on the nearby TV.Im pregnant.Those words circled inside Marcs mind until he thought hed go crazy.As soon as Kari told him the news, it was as if he was looking through a different lens, one that refused to let him see all the joy shed brought him for the past several weeks.And Daniel.Hed lucked out the way he always did, and now he was going to get to leave the place he hated and get on with his free and easy life.The unfairness of that settled over Marc like a giant black cloud.He finished the first beer, and when his burger came, he ordered another one.But he still couldnt get his mind off what had happened with Kari, so he drank that one and asked for one more.Soon the place started to fill up.No wonder.It was probably the only entertainment within twenty miles.The bartender switched one of the TVs to a baseball game, and Marc tried to concentrate on that, but he couldnt keep his mind from wandering again.He thought about City Limits, a place where he sat down at the bar and Terri was there to bring him his usual drink and chat a little.He could look across the room and see his friends and neighbors, and he knew every song on the vintage jukebox.It was an unsettling feeling to look around this place and see not one familiar face.And not a single person there recognized him.He remembered how much hed craved that sense of being lost in a crowd, but now it unnerved him, as if hed been dropped into an alternate universe where everybody was a stranger.Then the door opened and a woman walked in, late twenties, dark hair, wearing jeans, boots, and a tank top.She slid onto a stool two down from Marc.Buck immediately drew a Bud and set it down in front of her.She pulled a cigarette and lighter from her purse, lit the cigarette with a flick of her thumb, then blew out the smoke.Shed taken only a few sips of her beer when she turned to Marc.Id ask you if youre new in town, but honey, believe me.I know the men in this town, and youre definitely not one of them.Im just passing through.Where are you from?Rainbow Valley.Never heard of it.Im not surprised.She told him she worked at the hardware store down the street.Divorced.No kids.But her ex was a pain in the ass because he wanted to get back together and she wasnt interested.Not that he was abusive or anything like that, she said, but he had no ambition.She was going to beauty school as soon as she saved the money, and all he wanted to do was smoke pot and go fishing with his buddies.Fifteen minutes into their conversation, she moved to the barstool next to him.Marc ordered both of them another beer and told Buck to keep them coming.But as much as Marc tried to pay attention to the woman, her voice was nothing but white noise to him.He spoke often enough to keep the conversation going, but if somebody held a gun to his head and told him to repeat anything shed said, hed be a dead man.You seem a little down tonight, the woman said.Wanna talk about it?Nope.Okay.Far as Im concerned, we can stop talking altogether.She accompanied those words with a provocative smile, sliding her hand over to rest it on top of his.She was nice.Reasonably attractive.And available.Hed told this woman he was just passing through, so he had no doubt a one night stand was all she was looking for.All these years, hed thought that was exactly what he would be looking for, too.So why did the thought of it leave him cold?Somewhere in the depths of his alcohol soaked mind, he remembered a time when riding the back roads, seeing the sights, staying at tiny motels, and drinking at local bars had seemed like a great thing to do.And if a willing woman presented herself, hed planned on going for it.But now as it was happening, it seemed odd and surreal, like a dream that started out pleasant enough, only to morph into a nightmare.He pulled out his wallet and tossed money on the bar.Dont leave now, sweetie, the woman said.The partys just getting started.Thanks for the offer, but not tonight.Then stick around town for a while.Lots of sights to see.Right, Buck said as he passed by carrying a couple of beers.Grandma Braddocks got herself a new lawn gnome.Sure wouldnt want to miss that.Marc said good night and headed for the door, his head so fuzzy all he wanted to do was lie down.He stepped out of the bar and started back toward the motel, feeling relieved to no longer be listening to the blaring TVs and inhaling secondhand smoke.A few minutes later, he went into his motel room and locked the door behind him.He sat on the bed and reached for his phone, intending to check the weather.Even though the vineyard was Daniels responsibility, it was a habit so ingrained after all these years that he could be six feet under and hed still be pulling up those apps.His phone was dead.He grabbed his bag to retrieve his charging cord, only to realize he hadnt brought it with him.Hed been in such a hurry to get away that hed left it behind.In a hurry to get away?To go where?Here?Were you out of your fucking mind?He tossed his phone aside, closed his eyes, and thought of home, of the evenings hed spent on the deck with Kari at sunset, staring at the rolling hills and the leafy vines full of grapes.In his mind, he heard their quiet conversation, felt the night breeze, saw the fireflies twinkling in the distance, and tasted the best wine ever produced in the state of Texas.Sometimes on evenings like that, he had the sense that the vineyard had wrapped itself around him, crept inside, and become part of the very blood in his veins.If that were true, how could he separate himself from it without it killing him in the process?No.That was crazy.How many years had he dreamed of seeing Rainbow Valley in his rearview mirror?He always told himself that the moment he rode past the city limits sign and faced that new life ahead of him, any reservations he felt would vanish.Now he wasnt so sure.He didnt even bother to take off his clothes or pull down the covers.He just collapsed on the bed and closed his eyes, thinking about the beautiful green eyed woman who had lit up his life like the Fourth of July.She was pregnant with their baby.He was going to be a father again.And his last hazy thought as he drifted off to sleep was that maybe it wasnt a nightmare after all, but a dream come true.As Kari drove home from work that evening, she prayed shed go into the house and Marc would be there.He would have realized where his heart really was, his despair would be gone, and hed greet her with a smile and a hug.But when she got back to the vineyard, he wasnt there.Neither was Daniel.It was just her alone, sitting in that big house, a house that wasnt hers, never had been hers, a house shed have to move away from very soon because she didnt belong there.She had no idea what Marc would say when he finally did return, but if he still had that look on his face, the one that said everything theyd done for the past several weeks had been a mistake, shed be forced to move out even if he didnt ask her to because she wouldnt be able to stand it.She filled a glass with water and grabbed a box of crackers from the pantry, feeling so nauseated that all she could do was collapse in a kitchen chair and try to get somethinganythingdown.When she finally felt as if she might not throw up, she poured a glass of wine and went out to the deck.She couldnt drink alcohol now, but just having the glass in her hand and smelling the wine made her think of Marc before all this had happened.The dogs were there with her, stretched out beside her chair, both of them particularly sedate tonight.They said dogs knew the mental state of the people they loved and behaved accordingly.In this place, where pets outnumbered people, she thought it was especially true.Eventually she went inside and tucked herself into Marcs king sized bed, missing him so much tears came to her eyes.As she was falling asleep, she put her hand on her belly, imagining what it would be like to have Marc do the same, then look at her with love in his eyes.She slept fitfully that night, only to fall into a deep sleep near dawn.She didnt wake again until almost noon, feeling groggy and disoriented and sick to her stomach all over again.She threw on a robe and went into the kitchen.Daniel sat at the kitchen table, which meant she was going to have to keep up the facade, to act as if everything was just fine when nothing was going to be fine ever again.He didnt say a word as she came into the room.He just stared at his phone, and when Kari poured a cup of coffee and sat down next to him, he didnt even look up.Daniel?she said.Is something wrong?He slid his phone over.She recognized one of the weather apps Marc looked at a dozen times a day, and the screen showed something that made uneasiness creep through her.A storm?she said.I saw it last night, but it was going to miss us.Look at the trajectory now.
