Lately, those two words define me.Have me, he says.My heart stutters in my chest, and my dick hardens into the approximate texture of an iron bar.Does he even mean it the way it sounds?We havent talked about fucking since the one time.I want him so badly, but only if he wants it.Only one way to find out.I climb off him and yank his shorts down.And his briefs.His ass is perfectstrong and round, with a tan line cutting across at his waist.I kiss the tan line, because I have to.Mmm, he agrees, his eyes shut.I watch as he pushes his hips into the bed.Like me, Jamie has two speeds: horny and asleep.I yank off my shirt and then my shorts.The more of my skin that touches his, the happier I am.Then?His phone rings.I swear to God, if thats Holly  Since Im lying on his body, I swallow my annoyance and ask if he wants me to get it.Just check the number, he says lazily.Its probably nothing.But Jamies phone doesnt usually ring at this hour, so I look.Its not Holly.The display says KILLFEATHER.Um Its a camper.He lifts his head up quickly.Really?I hand over the phone, and he answers.Hello?He frowns.Where are you?Where?Another pause.Ill be right there.He ends the call.Whats the matter with your goalie?Jamie scowls, and I cant help noticing even his grumpy face is hot.That was Shen using Killfeathers phone.Apparently my goalie is drunk with two of your forwards.Theyre not far away, but Killfeather wont come home, and they didnt know what to do.I reach for my shirt.Lets go.Where are they?Behind the high school.Thats original.When I got you drunk, it was on the roof of the Hampton Inn.Jamie laughs, tugging his clothes into place.They cant all be Ryan Wesley.The town would have to double the size of its police force.By silent mutual agreement, we leave the dormitory like thieves in the night.If its necessary to call in reinforcements, Im sure Jamie will do it.But sometimes its just better to handle things quietly.Once outside, we book it toward the high school.Theres a fence around the place, but Jamie points to a two foot gap.When I squeeze through ahead of him, he puts a warm hand on my back, and I shiver slightly.Im so gone for him.I hope he cant tell.We find our charges sitting on their asses in the gravel under a sign that says The Blue Bombers.Its fitting, because these kids are bombed.Especially Killfeather.Jamie crouches down to talk to them.What seems to be the trouble here?Were, like, drunk, Davies says.Annnnd Killfeather wont go home.But we cant leave im here.I see.Jamie somehow keeps a straight face.Why wont you go home?he asks his goalie.Justsick of it all, Killfeather slurs, his head knocking back against the brick wall.Tomorrow we gotta just do it all over again.I see, Jamie says again.How much did you all drink?Shen makes a face.A six pack.Wait, what?Each?I ask sharply.Killfeather shakes his head.No.He pushes a six of longnecks into the light.The bottles are empty, of course.What else?I demand.Looking sheepish, Davies pulls an empty liter bottle of some local beer out from the shadows.Jamie takes it and reads the label.Okay.Anything else?Three heads shake.Whered you get it?Jamie asks.Paid a guy.Jamie tips his chin up to look at me, and I can see him struggling not to laugh.Thats how we got our beer at that age, too.Sidebar, he says, standing and beckoning to me.I walk around the corner of the building with him.Were only a few yards away, so he puts his lips right to my ear.Seriously?They got wasted on less than three beers each?Turning to whisper my answer, my chest brushes his shoulder.I let my lips brush his jaw before I speak.They have zero tolerance and a really fast metabolism.Werent we the same?Jamie chuckles and his breath tickles my ear.So no hospital.Nah, I say quickly.Nobody ever died from two and a half beers.Lets march em around, sober em up and then put em to bed.Sounds like a plan.Jamie stalks back around the corner.Okay, ladies.Lets go.Were going to make a deal.You three go for a little walk with us, and well take you home without turning you in to the authorities.Like, the police?Shen slurs.Naw, he means Pat, I clarify.Shen struggles to his feet.Okay.Lesh go.Davies rises, too.That leaves Killfeather still sitting there.Not budging.Jamie leans over, offering a hand.Come on now.You have practice in the morning.Wont be good enough, Killfeather mumbles.Youll be a little hung over, Jamie admits.But thats never killed anyone.Killfeather gives an adamant shake of the head.Wont be good enough for my father.Never will be.Nothing is.Ah.I could have written that speech myself.Dont play hockey for your dad, dude.You have to play for yourself.I try putting a hand out, too.This time he takes it.I haul him to his feet, which mostly works.He has to steady himself against the wall for a second, but then hes vertical on his own power.Seriously.Fuck im.Its your life.Killfeathers head dangles a little in the classic drunken pose.He needs to chill out.But some never do, I tell him.The truth hurts, but he should understand this as soon as he can.And you still have to live your life.If you dont, then he wins.What a waste, right?The young goalie nods with his whole body, like a horse.But hes listening to me.Lets go, then.Where are you taking us?Davies asks.Were going to have a little history lesson, Jamie replies.You chose to imbibe about fifty yards away from a legendary spot.He leads the kids across Cummings Road, and I manage not to make a crack about it.They shuffle along behind him until were standing in a dusty parking area behind the Olympic stadium.Okay, whats famous about this place?Um, Shen says.The arena.Where the U. S.  beat Russia to win the gold in 1980.Ah, Jamie says, raising a finger in the air.The U. S.  did beat the impressive Russian team four to three, with a team of twenty college students.But the gold medal game was two days later, against Sweden.Four to two.But thats not why were here.It isnt?Jamie shakes his head.See that hill?He points over his shoulder, and we all look up.I see another parking lot, Killfeather mutters.With a closed fist, Jamie cuffs him gently under the chin.Thats not just any parking lot, and its not just any hill.Herb Brooks was the coach of the U. S.  team.Thats why the building is named after him now.He put his guys in all their pads and ran em up and down that hill.Sounds like a party.Davies sighs.Were going to find out.Jamie rubs his hands together.On a count of three, everyone runs up there.Well go together.You too, Wesley.Im not running, Shen complains.Too drunk.Uh huh, I say, gripping his shoulder.Shoulda thought about that earlier.Lets go.I clap my hands.One, two, three!Jamie takes off across the gravel.Theres a grassy bit where the hill begins, and he reaches it quickly.I hang back to make sure the boys follow him.And they do, at a sluggish pace.Thats fine, because we really dont need any injuries.The moon is up, though.Its not all that dark, and there are floodlights at the top of the hill.Were all breathing hard within minutes.The hill is a real bitch, and Im glad Im not wearing my pads.The kids make it up to the top eventually, grumbling all the way.Then the five of us are panting in the parking lot, hands on hips, wishing we had water.I dont feel so good, Shen mumbles.In the bushes if youre going to yarf, I say quickly.This parking lot belongs to a golf club.Were already trespassing.He lurches off, just making it to a boxwood before there are sounds of retching.Well walk em down slowly, Jamie says, stroking his chin.And buy some water.And Advil.I have some in our room.Of course you do.I have to bite back a smile.Another silly, ridiculous night in Lake Placid with Jamie.I hope the next four weeks go slowly.On our way down, I have a little chat with Davies.So Whyd you guys have to go and get drunk?You could get kicked out of camp.He sticks out his chin.You told me to.Say what?You said to spend some time with them off the ice.I did that.I give this some thought.Okay.Its my job to tell you to quit breaking the rules.But I hear where youre coming from.And I like that you called Coach Canning when Killfeather wouldnt go home.I wouldnt just leave him there.He gets a friendly slap on the back for that.Good man.Stay out of trouble and we can keep these shenanigans private, okay?Okay.We walk back to the dormitory through the fresh summer air while the moon rises higher over the lake.I cant wait to get home.23      Wes      Forty minutes later I have Jamies dick in my mouth and Im stroking his prostate like a champion.Hes writhing and begging.Give me more, he pants.Give me the D.  You know you want to.I release him with a pop, and practically swallow my own tongue.The casual way hes asked me to fuck just blows my mind.I dont know, I stammer.He opens one heated eye and looks at me.Christ.Sometimes it feels like youve got your whole arm up there, anyway.How is it so different?Because it just is.Dont get me wrongI want inside that fine ass of his more than I want my next breath.But Im also afraid.Its not a familiar sensation.I never used to care about the consequences of my actions.But if we do this, I wont just be fucking Jamie.It will mean something to me.And chances are, it wont to him.For him, itll be another little experiment he can take with him before he goes off and settles down with some girl.Hes watching me now, waiting for me to decide.And while he waits hes gently jacking himself and staring into my eyes.Holy shit, Im going to do it.Im going to fuck the only man Ive ever loved.I can hardly breathe as I reach for the lube.Then I realize I need a condom too, so I climb off the bed in search of my duffel bag.I stashed a whole box of them in there, though Im not entirely sure why.When I took the job at camp, it was for the sole purpose of spending time with Jamie, not to go on some kind of sex spree with the gay locals.I never thought Id be opening this box.With Jamie.For Jamie.Are you sure?I ask thickly.He nods.Those brown eyes burn with hunger.They shine with trust.I memorize that expression, the way he looks lying there at my mercy, big and hard and rippling with masculine power.I take my time with him, more generous than usual with the lube.Fuck, I dont want to hurt him, and I absolutely dont want him to hate this.I cant help but remember my first time, how cheap it made me feel, being used by a guy who didnt give a shit whether I enjoyed myself or not.I want this to be so good for Jamie.One finger wont be enough this time.My voice is so gravelly it stings my throat.Youll need to get used to more before Iuh  He sounds as raspy voiced as I do.Youll stop if I dont like it?My heart squeezes.Of course.I lean over him and plant a reassuring kiss on his lips, then wink at him.Just say ballsack if you want me to stop.A wave of laughter shudders through him.Oh shit.I totally forgot about that.I laugh too as I think about the ridiculous code word we made up when we were fourteen.Im not sure who came up with itwho am I kidding?It was obviously mebut wed used it during our wrestling phase.We decided MMA was the coolest shit ever and spent hours in the gym practicing our moves.Except half the time when one of us tapped out, the other wouldnt notice, so we devised a safe word.I dont think Ill ever forget the day Pat walked into the gym and found usme, flat on my stomach with Jamies knee digging into the back of my neck, while I yelled Ballsack!over and over again.Ready to come harder than youve ever come in your life?I ask solemnly, lifting one of his knees up.He smiles.You sure you want to put that much pressure on yourself, dude?No pressure.Just fact.Science has proven it.Now he snickers, but the sound dies when the tip of my finger circles his hole.His ass cheeks instantly clench.Not in fear, but anticipation.I see it in his eyes, a raw gleam of heat, before he lifts up his other knee and all but puts himself on display for me.Jesus.Nope, not gonna survive this.I tease and caress for several long moments before slipping my finger inside.My other hand grips his erection.Im selfish, but I dont want him to come until Im buried inside him, so I dont take him in my mouth or jerk him as hard as I know he wants.Slow, featherlight strokes are all he gets as I work my finger into his tight hole.When a second finger joins the party, his brows draw together.Beads of sweat break out on his forehead.Mine, too.Loosening him up is one of the hottest things Ive ever done.It takes all my concentration.Stroking, teasing, twisting, getting him ready for me.At three fingers, he moans loud enough to wake the dead, and I release his erection to press my palm to his mouth.Quiet, baby.Wes Hes squirming now, pushing his ass against my probing fingers.Every time I connect with his prostate, he pants out a breath.I need more.Hes beautiful.Goddamn beautiful.And Im so hard it hurts.My heartbeat takes off like its on a breakaway as I tear open the condom packet with my teeth.I cover myself with one hand, then pour lube on the condom to get the latex even slicker.My fingers continue to torment Jamies ass.You ready for it?I rasp.His lips part on a shaky breath.He nods.Gripping my shaft, I position myself between his big thighs.My breathing is equally unsteady.Hell, my hand is trembling around my cock as if Ive never done this before.But I havent done this.Not with someone I love.The head of my cock nudges his hole.He tenses again, clenching to deny me entrance.I find his erection and stroke my fist up its length.Breathe, I whisper.Relax for me.His throat dips.Then he lets out another breath.I push forward again, and this time Im able to ease in.Just the tip, but holy hell, the pressure is incredible.Hes hot and tight, squeezing me into oblivion.Ohfuckohfuckohfuck.Its all he seems capable of saying as my cock tunnels deeper.Jamies cheeks are flushed, his eyes glassy.If I last more than five strokes, itll be a miracle.Then again, we are in Lake Placid, which just happens to be Miracle Central.His erection pulsates in my fist, but I dont stroke it.Not yet.Not until he begs me to.Jamieyou doing good?He moans in response.Im all the way in now, and my dick is in heaven.Im in heaven.I lean forward and cover his torso with mine, my elbows on either side of his head as I bend down to kiss him.Then I start to move.Oh God He whispers the words into my lips and I swallow them up with another tongue tangling kiss.I fuck him slowly, letting him get used to the sensation, but Jamie Canning is a master at adapting.Its him who wraps his arms around me, who hooks his legs around my ass.Its him who starts rocking up to meet my every thrust, and him who says, Faster, Wes as I desperately try to go slow.Dont wanna hurt you, I mumble.Wanna come, he mumbles back.I smile when he snakes one hand between the tight seal of our bodies, trying to find his cock.Hes burning up, his face and chest flushed with desire.When he bears down on my ass and groans in frustration, I take pity on my man and rise to my knees again, yanking his hips to pull him closer.The new angle makes him curse.His fingers seek out his erection, but I gently bat them away.My job, baby.I make you come.I withdraw until just my cockhead remains inside him.Our gazes lock.His breathing quickens.Then I jack his dick in a long, hard pump at the same time I slam back in.I have to give him credithe manages to stay quiet this time.He bites his lip to keep from groaning, his gorgeous features strained.Hes close.I can see it in his eyes, feel it in the urgency with which he grinds his ass against my groin.Im covered in sweat.My own release is imminent and I want so badly to prolong it, but thats like passing the puck to Gretzky and asking him not to take a shot.Theres no stopping the orgasm.It sizzles in my balls and ripples through my shaft, and I come while still jacking Jamies cock.My world is reduced to the man beneath me.I nearly act out a scene right out of a chick flick and shout I love you!while I shudder in release.But I fight the temptation and focus on getting Jamie where he needs to go.My dick remains rock hard despite the mind blowing climax.I keep fucking him, keep thrusting forward as my hand works his erection.Ohyessss  Sheer bliss rolls through me when his release soaks my fingertips.He comes on a strangled cry.And keeps coming.And then comes some more.I guess nobody can say he didnt enjoy himself.When he finally goes still, I collapse on his sticky chest and growl in his ear.That was the hottest thing Ive ever seen.He clings to me, his big palms pressed to my damp back.We lie that way a long time.Im just drifting on my own happiness.I lead a big life, and its a hell of a ride.But there arent many moments like this.I want to bottle it and carry it everywhere I go.Finally Jamie speaks.Do you think anyones still sick?Wha?There are only two people who exist to me right now, so I have no idea what hes asking.I was just hoping they got it all out on the way home.Hes talking about the drunk teens who took half a fucking hour to walk home tonight.We had to keep stopping while they upchucked.Theyre fine, I murmur.I kiss Jamies sweaty neck, and he tastes like heaven.Should we clean up?he asks.I cant hold on to this moment any longer.It wont stretch and stay with me no matter how badly I want it to.Yeah.You want to go first?You go ahead.I take my sticky self into the bathroom for a sixty second shower.When I get back to the room, Jamie departs for his own shower.I stare at my bed, cursing its size.The twin beds are built into the wall, so the only times Ive pushed them together have been in my imagination.Sometimes we fall asleep together, but its a really tight fit.I have an idea, though.Actually Ive thought of this before, but Im too chicken to bring it up.Fuck it, though.The summer is half over.In for a penny, in for a pound.My mattress slides off the wooden frame when I give it a tug.I drop it on the floor beside my bed.Theres just enough room left for Jamie to do the same.Standing there staring down at my mattress, I feel exposed in a way I havent ever felt before.Jamie and I fool around, but we dont talk about it.I dont ask him for anything except orgasms.It has to be that way.Im heading to Toronto in a month, where Ive vowed to keep my head down and play the best hockey those fuckers have ever seen.My rookie year is going to be spotlessno scandals, no shenanigans.Its shocking, but my dad and I are actually in agreement about something for once in our sorry excuse of a relationship: flashing my sexuality around is not a good idea right now.Which is why it terrifies me that Im becoming so attached to Canning.Says the guy whos already stupidly, disgustingly in love with him  I am, and always have been.I love everything about him.His quiet strength, his dry humor, his carefree approach to life that contrasts with his controlled manner on the ice.That sexy as sin body  Ive made sure to keep my feelings for him under wraps, though.He thinks were just messing around.Good time Wes just having some fun.But Ive changed the game for myself tonight.And if I let him know how much I want him beside me in bed, thats changing it for him, too...Which is why Im just standing here in my underwear, arguing with myself about whether or not I should have thrown a mattress on the floor.The door opens behind me, and Im so busted.Jamie towels off his hair.He looks down at the mattress.Never thought of that, he says.The towel lands on our unused desk chair, and then he yanks his mattress down, too.My face heats as I go to switch off the light.Its hard to move around the room with the floor space eaten up with mattresses.Jamie gets into bed on his side, and I lie down too.I wrap an arm around his waist and stroke his bare belly with my hand.You okay?I murmur.As if Ive changed our sleeping arrangement to comfort him.As if.Im going to be sore, arent I?he asks.I hesitate.Maybe a little.Sorry.He picks up my hand and kisses the palm.Totally worth it.Now Im grinning in the dark.I hold him as close as I dare.Even if my entire life goes to shit before breakfast tomorrow, Ill always have this night.24      Jamie      The kids arent nearly as hung over as they should be.Id forgotten how the teenage body can bounce back from anything.All the days drills are over already, and nobody even looks green.Now the teens are scrimmaging on the practice rink, and Killfeather is kicking some serious ass.Every time he makes a save I feel like I did something good.This kid is going to be great someday.Hes scholarship material, and I hope the father Killfeather complains about can appreciate it.The young forwards Wes has been coaching are finally pulling it together.Theyve taken quite a few shots on goal already.And Wes is reffing the game.Even the lazy backward circles he skates are fluid and powerful.Theres so much talent in this room right now I can hardly believe it.This is why Ive made the 2,500 mile trek every year.For this.Theres another attack on the net.Shen makes a tape to tape pass to Davies, who doesnt hesitate.He fires it into the goal before Killfeather can stop him.A small whoop of victory rises up from the scoring team.Smoked you, Killfeather!Davies yells.Youre a sieve, sucka!Oh, fuck.Here we go.I watch Killfeather push his mask up.Then he takes his water bottle off the top of the net and pours some into his mouth.Im half expecting him to spit it into Davies face, because my boys face is red.I brace for disaster.Killfeather tosses the bottle onto the net.Then he locks eyes with me.Please dont blow like a land mine, I silently beg him.My goalie actually gives me a small smile before he speaks.Yeah, Davies.You owned me.Only took you two dozen tries, you big bad thing.He yanks his mask down over his face and picks up his stick.Wes is grinning when he skates over to retrieve the puck.Good attitude today, kid, he tells Killfeather.The teenager looks a little smug when he tosses the puck into Wess hand.Im so engrossed in this little drama I dont notice heads are swiveling to look at someone whos appeared behind the penalty box.Jamie!Over here!I turn around to find Holly standing there, waving her arms.Holly, I say stupidly.What are you doing here?She rolls her eyes, her hands on the hips of a tiny pair of jean shorts.Thats a heck of a greeting, Canning.You can do a little better than that.Holy crap, Killfeather blurts out.Coach Cannings girlfriend has a great rack.Shut it, I mutter, glaring at him.More than a dozen teenage boys are now eye fucking Holly in her teeny shorts and skimpy top.My neck is hot all of a sudden.And thats before I glance at Wes.He skates up, a twisted little smile on his lips.Youre having a visitor, Canning?Um.Ive lost the ability to speak, because Im busy sifting through all the uncomfortable conversations coming my way.Holly, this is my friend Wes.I remember you from the hotel, she says with a wink.Wes keeps his own smile waxed on, and youd have to know him as well as I do to see the sneer beneath it.Yikes.Looks like you should quit early, Coach.Take your girl out for drinks.Catch up a little.That would be awesome, Holly says.I stopped at the dormitory first, and Coach Pat said I could probably shake Jamie free.Yeah, okay, I say slowly.Lets head out.You kids have fun, Wes drawls.Then he turns his back on me and blows his whistle.Lets go, ladies!Enough standing around.Thats how I find myself removing my skates and exiting the rink an hour early with Holly.God, you look good!She stops on the steps of the building to hit me with another blinding smile, then stands up on her tiptoes and kisses me.Her mouth is smaller and softer than I expect it to be.Confusion must be written all over my face, because she says, Sorry to surprise you, but I thought it would be fun.Its Wow, I stammer.How did you get here?Well, when I threatened to take up trapeze, my uncle lent me his car.Thought Id get away for the night.I do the math.Its got to be a five hour drive from Cape Cod.Wow, I say again.Apparently wow is now three quarters of my vocabulary.Jamie, she says, staring up at me.Stop freaking out.What?She tilts her head to the side, and those familiar blue eyes study me.Youre panicking.Why?Um I cant tell her.But I cant not tell her.Because Holly is almost certainly planning to stay with me tonight.In fact, last summer I told her she could visit and Id make it work, but she hadnt been able to swing it then.Fuck.Honey.She reaches up to cup the side of my neck.Is there someone else?My heart spasms, because there is someone else.Sort of.Wes and I arent a couple, exactly.Weve never had one word of conversation about it.But theres no way Im sleeping with someone else right nowthat just wouldnt be right.There is, I admit.Her eyes widen.Shed asked the question, but she still seems pretty shocked by my answer.Who is she?I shake my head.You dont know her.Im sorry, I say quickly.She takes her hand off me and steps backward.Okay.She bites her lip.I should have called.Im sorry, I repeat.And I am.Holly has only been good to me.But after graduation, wed had a little talk.Shed said, I want to see you when youre in Detroit, and Id said, Thats probably not going to work.Shed said, Well see.And now here she is, her face turning red.Look, I tell her.Lets go have ice cream.Or tequila, if you prefer.I want to catch up with you.Were still friends, she says softly.Always.Her eyes wander away from me and over toward the lake.She takes a slow breath and lets it out again.Okay, Jamie Canning.Show me Lake Placid.You always talk about how much you love it here.Her gaze returns to mine.Show me why.For a moment, my mind goes straight into the gutter, because Lake Placid means something a little different to me this summer than it ever has before.But I clobber that thought and hold out a hand for her.How do you feel about waffle cones?She closes her fingers around mine.I feel pretty good about waffle cones.We spend the afternoon together walking all over town.Holly likes to poke around in the little touristy shops, and this gets old pretty fast.But since Ive ruined her day once already, I just go along with it.I show her the toy store with the awesome rubber band guns, and she buys one for her brother.They have targets set up inside the store, so we stand there for a long time trying to outshoot each other.A few doors down theres another kitschy shop, and I hold back my sigh when she leads me inside.She stops to look at a bunch of Miracle on Ice coffee mugs, while I wander over to the back aisle where they have a bunch of candy for sale in bulk.And when I take a closer look, I let out a bark of disbelief.What is it?Holly asks.Purple Skittles!I grab a bag and hold it under the chute.Pull the lever, I tell Holly.She does, and I dont say stop until the bag is full.Then I chuckle all the way to the checkout counter.Whats so funny?I toss my wallet onto the counter.I have this friend, I begin.I feel like a heel describing Wes that way, but its the best I can do at the moment.We used to send this box back and forth with, like, gag gifts inside.Thats fun.And he likes purple Skittles?Yeah.Except the last time I sent him purple Skittles in the box, you had to buy all the colors at once.I bought four giant bags at BJs Holy God, the name of the store causes an inappropriate bubble of laughter to rise in my chest.I sorted them myself and sent him only the purple ones.Then I shared, like, five pounds of the other ones with my high school buddies at a party.It was a kegger, and when they did the Technicolor yawn, it was really Technicolor.She hip checks me.Thanks for that visual.My pleasure.When we step outside, she clears her throat.Jamie, I need to find a place to stay tonight.Can we sit down somewhere so I can use my phone?I dont answer right away, because Im wracking my brain for a solution.Which doesnt come easy, because the dormitory is always plenty full.Let me find you a hotel room, I suggest.Ive got it, she says quickly.Seriously.Its no big deal.Still.Lets sit on the porch at the dorm.You can use the wi fi.And if everything is booked up, Ill ask Pat for help.Thank you.Her voice is low.Another apology is on the tip of my tongue.But I dont say it, because I dont think she wants to hear it.Theres nobody in the rocking chairs, so I set Holly up with the wi fi password and tell her Im going to get us a couple of drinks.Ill be right back, I promise.Then I shoot up the stairs and drop by our room, hoping that Wes is there.The room is empty.Before I leave again, I dig out that gift box Wes had sent me in Boston.Id brought it all the way to Lake Placid, because I was trying to decide whether I should restart our meme.But then he showed up here, and I forgot about it entirely.Now I dump a motherlode of purple candy into the box and close the cover.Setting it on his pillow, I wonder if I should leave some kind of note.But what the hell would it say?Before Holly showed up, it didnt seem to matter that Wes and I were hooking up without any sort of discussion about it.We didnt need a label.This room was like our private bubbleeverything that happened here was just between us.The rest of the world didnt matter.And that was fine.Except the rest of the world still exists, whether I remember it or not.Suddenly this whole thing has gotten all kinds of tricky, and not because of Hollythat was just an awkward moment with a friend.In a few short weeks, though, he and I would land on two different NHL teams in two different cities.We were heading for an upset regardless, and I just hadnt realized it.Hurrying back downstairs, I grab two sodas and take them to the porch where my ex fuck buddy waits.I found a place just outside of town, she says.It wasnt even expensive.Are you sure?I dont want you to  She holds up a hand, silencing me.Its fine, sweetie.And in the morning Im going to drive back to Massachusetts, okay?We could  Holly shakes her head.You have a job to do.And its not your fault, Jamie.I didnt I wasnt being smart.The words are firm, but her eyes water a little, and it kills me to see it.Im sorry, I whisper.I do care about you but  Once more she waves me off.You were never dishonest, Jamie.Dont start now.Well okay then.We go out to dinner together.I pick a nice seafood restaurant right on the water, but as we eat our crabcakes, the mood is subdued.Will you tell me about her?she asks at one point.I shake my head.Lets not do that.Holly gives me a rueful grin.I was just trying to be a big girl about it.I take a long look at her.Can I tell you something Im trying to be a big girl about?Holly giggles, and Im happy to have made her do that.What?The idea of moving to Detroit depresses the hell out of me.I havent said that to anyone yet, and it feels good to get it off my chest.She stirs her drink with her straw.I know its not the prettiest city in the world, but you can find a nice place there, I bet.I shake my head.Urban decay isnt the problem.Although it isnt helping me picture a life there.I dont know a soul.And Im not getting any playing time next year.Lets be honest.Oh, honey.She sighs.The first year could suck.But youre good at what you do.See, I know that.Its not that I lack confidence.But the odds of really making it as a goalie are awful.It isnt just the first year that might suck.It could be five years where they play me twice a season, and Im just waiting around for my big chance.Or they send me to the minors, and I play seven games instead of two.Or someone could get hurt, and your number could come up.She puts her hand over mine.But I know what youre saying.Its a long shot.And it wont be your fault if it doesnt work out.A waiter comes over to take our plates out of the way, and Holly orders a piece of blackout cake.And two spoons.Ive never been a fan of blackout cake, but now is not the time to point that out.I dont like feeling ungrateful, I tell her.Everyone is so excited for methey hear NHL and get stars in their eyes.Im not sure what to do.I guess you show up and try it.Give it a year?Maybe.Thats the easy choice.But I can see how I could end up waiting forever.You could keep telling yourself, just a little longer!Maybe theres something else I could do with that year, though.What does your friend Wes think?she asks suddenly.What?The mention of his name startles me.What does he think about Detroit?She waits for my answer.I, uh, havent asked his opinion, I confess.He wants to be in the pros so badly.Im not sure hed understand.But its different for him.Theres more demand for centers.And hes got that Frozen Four win...Should have been yours, Holly says firmly.Shes loyal to the core.I look across the table at her wide set eyes and wish things were different.If I was in love with Holly, life would be less confusing.But Im not.And it isnt.When the dark chocolate cake arrives, I tell her Im too full to have any.Then I pick up the check on my way to the mens room, so she cant get to it first.25      Wes      Its past midnight when I stumble back to the dorm.Luckily Pat isnt sitting guard in one of the rocking chairs, because theres no way I can carry on a normal conversation right now.Walking in a straight line is also a challenge.Yeppers, I might be a wee bit drunk.I approach mine and Cannings door and stare at it for a good minute.Fuck, what if his girl is in there?I stayed away for as long as I could, but a mans gotta sleep sometime.And Im not fucking doing it on the porch.He wouldve texted me if she was crashing here and told me to stay away.Right?The thought is like a hot blade to the gut.I cant believe his fucking girlfriend showed up at camp.He spent the whole day with her.Whole night too, probably.My hands curl into fists as a parade of unwelcome images marches through my head.Jamies big hands roaming Hollys feminine curves.His cock sliding inside her.His lips lifting in that dirty grin he always gives me right before he puts his mouth on my dick.Im such a goddamn moron.I shouldnt have started anything with him.It was going to end once I left for Toronto, anyway.So hell, maybe its better if it just ends now.I finally suck it up and turn the doorknob.Its unlocked.And when I enter the room, I see Jamies mattress is on the floor again, just where it had been last night.But mine is on the bed frame where Id put it this morning.Jamie is the only one in the room, too.My blood pressure eases, but just a bit.Hes asleep.Good, because Im not in the right frame of mind to talk to him right now.I can feel my temper pulsing through my veins along with all the alcohol I drank.The rooms annoyingly dark.I stumble forward, bumping my arm on the side of the dresser as I reach down to unbutton my jeans.I kick em off, then tackle my shirt.There.Im in my boxers now.I just need to make it to the bed without waking Canning, and then well both be sound asleep and the Big Talk can be dealt with in the morning.I ease my body onto the mattress as quietly as possible.Hell yeah.I did it.My drunken ass is now in bed and Jamie is still sleepi  My head collides with something hard, and then an explosion of sound blasts through the room.A cacophony of pings and dings and clangs assaults my ears.Its as if someone took a sledgehammer to a gumball machine and unleashed a wave of candy.I stagger to my feet, cursing loudly when I step on something hard and round.Son of a motherfucking bitch!I hop around on one foot as I use my hand to rub away the pain shooting through the other foot.Jamie bolts into a sitting position, his panicked voice slicing through the darkness.What the hell?Seriously?Youre asking me?I squawk.What did you put on my pillow?Skittles.He says this as if its supposed to make sense.Why?I kneel down, fumbling for the box Id just conked my head on.I hear Jamies footsteps heading for the door, and then a switch flicks and light floods the room.Jesus.A sea of purple Skittles covers the floor and Jamies mattress.And a lump rises in my throat as I realize the significance of what Im seeing.Canning kept the box Id given him in Boston, filled it with my favorite candy and left it on my pillow.As an apology for spending the day with his ex?Or is it an apology for something else?Something worselike fucking his ex.Jamie squats beside me.Help me clean this up.He sounds pissed.Looks it, too.Which only pisses me off, because what the hell does he have to be angry about?Im the one who got ditched today.We dont speak as we start picking up Skittles.His jaw is set in a tense line, and hes tossing the candy back in the box with more force than necessary.What?I mutter when I catch him scowling at me.Youre back late.His voice is tight.Its our night off.I grabbed a drink at Lous.I stick a hand under my bed and gather up more Skittles.Id say you had more than one.Your breath smells like a brewery.His tone suddenly sharpens.You didnt drive, did you?Naw.I got a ride.With who?Whats with the Twenty Questions?Jamie whips a Skittle into the box but it bounces right back out, skidding under the desk.None of the other guys have cars, Wes.Please dont tell me you hitched with some random stranger.Guilt pricks my insides.But why the fuck am I feeling guilty?Unlike some people, I didnt spend the day gallivanting around with an ex.Who drove you home?he demands when I dont answer.I meet his gaze head on.Sam.Jamies breath hitches.Theres no mistaking the cloud of hurt in his eyes.Are you kidding me?The guy from that hook up app?I met him for a drink, I say with a shrug.Whats the big deal?He doesnt answer.He just kneels on his mattress, gathering up more candy.Are you seriously pissed off right now?I fight a burst of annoyance.Because youre not the one who got ditched today, Canning.Like hell!First of all, you told me to take off early.And I didnt know she was coming, okay?She showed up out of the blue, and, what, Im supposed to ignore her?Shes my friend.Shes your fuck buddy, I shoot back.Not anymore.He stands up and rakes both hands through his hair, then grabs the box and slams it on the desk.The floor looks pretty clear, but I know theres no way we managed to pick up all the candy.Canning mustve cleaned out that entire fucking candy store.Either way, the Skittles are all but forgotten as Jamie levels an irritated look in my direction.But just because were not fooling around doesnt mean shes not my friend anymore.And she drove all this way to see me.So yeah, I spent the day with her.Went shopping, grabbed some dinner.I cant control the hot streak of jealousy that races through me.Bet that was fun.Did you eat some pussy for dessert?His mouth falls open.Did you really just fucking say that?I sure did, and I dont even regret it.Im sick to death of not knowing where I stand.Where we stand.Last night, I was inside this guy.And the second Holly showed up, he acted like we were strangers.He hadnt even looked at me before hed gone off with her.Aint gonna lieit hurt.Am I wrong?I ask flatly.Jamie releases a slow, even breath, as if hes trying to calm himself.I want to punch you right now, Wesley.Like, for real.I set my jaw.What, for daring to call you out on the fact that youre still into women?You really think Id just roll out of bed with you and into bed with her?I didnt hook up!Which is more than I can say for you and your precious Sam.I didnt hook up with him, either.Frustration spirals through me.We just met up for a drink and talked about you the whole time.Jackass.Jamie blinks.Then why the hell are we arguing right now?I falter.Uh.Im not sure anymore.Theres a beat.Then we both let out a tense chuckle.Im feeling a lot less hostile and a lot more sober as I walk over to shut off the light again.When I turn back toward Jamie, hes beckoning to me in the dark from his mattress on the floor.When I sit on the edge, he tugs me down to his pillow.Were stretched out on our sides, facing each other.Were both waiting for the other to speak.Then Jamie sighs, his expression flickering with resignation.I dont like the idea of you messing around with anyone else.I swallow my surprise.Right back atcha, babe.I told Holly there was someone else, he admits.Pretty much right when she got here.My heart soars.You did?His voice is thick.Yeah.I told Sam the same thing, I confess.He tried to cop a feel when we hugged hello, and I straight up said I wasnt there for that.His eyes narrow.He slides toward me, one arm coming around my waist as his warm palm settles over my ass.Where did he touch you?Jamie squeezes one of my butt cheeks.Here?
