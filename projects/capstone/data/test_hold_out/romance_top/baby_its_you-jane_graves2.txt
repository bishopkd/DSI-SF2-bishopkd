Kari took off the poncho and gave it to Marc.He left the room, making two trips to bring her luggage upstairs.She gave him a smile.Thanks for your help.Ill call Rick first thing in the morning and tell him where your car is.Drop by his place tomorrow and hell let you know what its going to cost to get it fixed.Gus will give you directions.Without another word, he turned around and left the room, closing the door behind him.Kari just stood there dumbly, blinking with disbelief.She didnt know what shed expected him to do next, but after all theyd been through tonight, she thought at least he would say something to wrap up the occasion, like Nice to meet you, or maybe Have a nice life.But hed said nothing.Never mind.Doesnt matter.You have to get out of this dress.She reached her hands behind her back.Felt for a button.When she came up short, she stretched her arms a little more.Felt around again.Still nothing.And then it struck her.It had taken Hilda and Jill ten minutes to fasten this dress up the back, one minuscule button at a time.Kari realized she might be able to unhook some of the lower ones, but she didnt have a prayer with the ones in the middle of her back.A tremor of panic seized her.She might as well have been in a straitjacket.She dropped her hands to her sides and considered her options.As it turned out, she had only one.Hoisting as much of the muddy train as she could, she hurried to the door and yanked it open.Wait!A few seconds later, Marc came back up the stairs and peered at her from the landing.What?I have a little problem.His brows drew together with irritation.What problem?Uhthis dress  What about it?The buttons are in the back.There are about a thousand of them, and theyre really tiny.So?SoI cant get out of it by myself.Marc blinked.What do you mean, you cant get out of it by yourself?I need you to take it off me.3    Marc was stunned.Take it off her?As in undress her?I cant do that.You have to, Kari said.No.I dont believe I do.I told you I cant breathe.If I dont get out of this dress, Ill probably faint dead away.Is that what you want?Her hand went to her stomach again, her already pale complexion turning white.He couldnt exactly hand this one off to Gus.But with Estelle gone, what was he supposed to do?Beat on doors until he found a woman who wouldnt mind unbuttoning a wedding dress?He came to her door, dropping his voice.You dont even know me, and you want me to unbutton your dress?Hadnt you better rethink that?I dont know.Do I need to rethink it?He narrowed his eyes.How do you know Im not a dangerous man?Are you a dangerous man?Of course not!Then theres no problem, is there?You dont take the word of a dangerous man when he tells you hes not dangerous!But if youre not dangerous, I can take your word for it, right?Marcs number two pet peeve.Convoluted logic that led to the right conclusion.God, he hated that.Actually, Kari said, it was dumber for me to get into your truck with you.God only knows where you might have taken me.At least here if I scream, somebody will hear me, right?Right, Marc thought, even though he didnt want to say so, particularly since she smiled when she said it.He wasnt finding a whole lot funny about any of this.And if you had nefarious intent, Kari added, would you have taken the trouble to bring me here?Marc screwed up his face.Nefarious intent?Sorry.I was a lit major.I like big words.Oh, for Gods sake, he muttered, stepping back inside the room.He moved around behind her, nudging her dress out of the way with his foot so he could come up closer to her.She was right.There were approximately four thousand tiny buttons closed with fabric loops.He tried the first button, but his fingers were just too damned big.It was as if she was asking him to thread a needle with a rope.Uhhows it going back there?she asked.Im working on it.He pulled one of the little loops, and after a while he managed to shove the button through it.There, he said.There what?I got one of them.One?Do you know how tiny these buttons are?Youre going to have to work faster than that.Im doing the best I can.A minute later, hed undone the second one.Had it been too long since hed undressed a woman?Was that the problem?Use it or lose it?Or did he just need a magnifying glass for these damned buttons?Which brought him to another not so nice conclusion.Maybe his eyesight was going, too.Please hurry, she said, a tremor of panic in her voice.I think its shrinking as it dries.Look, youve already said you cant do this yourself.So right now Im all youve got.I know.But that doesnt make breathing any easier.He fumbled with button number three, poking and pulling.Can you suck in a little bit?If I could suck in, she said pointedly, I could breathe.And if I could breathe, this wouldnt be a problem.How many more?Do you want me to count buttons or unbutton them?She sighed.Keep going.These buttons are just too small, he said.Hell, the dress is, too.Why are you wearing a dress thats too small?You have to order a wedding dress months in advance.How am I supposed to know exactly what size Ill be when it finally comes in?Isnt that what tailors are for?You can let something out only so much.He fumbled with button number four a little longer.It was hopeless.Do you plan on wearing this dress again?She looked down at herself with a sigh.No.Its ruined.Marc reached into his pocket, pulled out a pocketknife, and flipped it open.He tucked the tip of the knife beneath one of the fabric button loops, gave it a flick, and the button came loose.He freed another one.And another.How are you doing that?she asked.Pocketknife.She spun around.Youre cutting the button loops?Do you want out of this dress or not?This dress cost five thousand dollars!Marc drew back.For one dress?Its Vera Wang.Very what?No.Veraoh, never mind.She sighed.Keep going.He continued like that all the way down.As the sides of the dress parted, her body slowly relaxed.His gaze trailed down the indentation of her spine, which curved gently all the way to her waist, with skin that looked so soft and fragile he was sure one touch would leave a bruise.As she took a deep breath, her body shifted and the dress fell open a little more, revealing the top of her baby pink panties.Marcs heart beat faster.Something about that little scrap of fabric peeking out just about did him in.Hed been too long without a woman.That was the problem.When just the sight of a pair of panties made him hot, he had some serious catching up to do.Three more buttons, and the task was done.As he clicked his knife shut and returned it to his pocket, she turned around slowly, her hands clasping the bodice of the dress against her breasts to hold it up.As she stared up at him, for the first time he looked past the raccoon rings and the wet lashes and focused on her eyes.They were green.No, more than just green.Hed always prided himself on being a concrete thinker with no room in his ordered mind for metaphorical crap, but suddenly he had a mental picture of the shimmery color of dewdrops glittering on grape leaves in early autumn.Where the hell had that come from?He tried to look away, but away turned into down.From one of her shoulders to the other was an expanse of creamy skin sprinkled with raindrops that shimmered in the dim lamplight, complete with delicate collarbones overlaid with a dainty pearl necklace.He couldnt stop staring at her.He couldnt even blink.He swore he was staring so hard his eyeballs were turning to dust.As his gaze moved lower still, he zeroed in on the most beautiful thing hed seen in agesher breasts swelling above the lacy bodice of the dress she held against her.He didnt get it.Brides were supposed to at least pretend they were sweet and virginal, only to wear dresses that made men picture them naked.And that was exactly what he was doing right then.He knew he should be ashamed of himself for that.Rescue a damsel in distress, then fantasize about ravishing her?What kind of man did that?One who hadnt seen a naked woman in so long he barely remembered what one looked like.Oh, no, she said.Look at your shirt.It must have gotten muddy when you helped me up the stairs.Im sorry.She touched her fingertips to his chest, tracing the muddy blotches.Marc had been so preoccupied by having a near naked woman standing in front of him that he hadnt even thought about his muddy shirt.And now all he could think about was her soft, soft hand on his muddy shirt.Then she flattened her palm against him, and when he felt the warmth of it, his nerves went haywire.Her hand against his chest was actually making him hard, so hard he was sure not an ounce of blood was getting to his brain.She flexed her fingers against his chest, and fireworks exploded inside his head.Then it dawned on him.Good God.Was she actually coming on to him?He wasnt sure.But if she was, it was wrong.So wrong.She was a marginally crazy woman whod left her fianc at the altar not five hours before, standing in front of him wearing a muddy dress with her hair in a wet blob on the side of her head.So why did none of that seem to matter to him?Why could he think of nothing else but tossing her down on that bed and having his way with her?Suddenly he heard footsteps in the hall.He jerked around just in time to see Gus push the door openthe one Marc realized now that hed left ajar.Gus stopped short, looking back and forth between them.Kari was standing with her back to the door.That dress was unbuttoned below her waist.And those damned pink panties  He had definitely gotten an eyeful.I was just bringing you sheets and whatnot, he told Kari, holding them up.Tell you what.Why dont I just leave them right here on the dresser?As he set them down, he had the nerve to smile.You kids have a good time now.With that, he stepped out of the room and closed the door behind him.Well, crap, Marc muttered.Whats wrong?Kari asked.I have to go.Uhokay, she said, and he swore she sounded disappointed.Wishful thinking?It didnt matter.He had to get out of there.It didnt bother him for somebody to know he was with a woman.But it did bother him for somebody to think he was ravishing a helpless woman he didnt even know an hour after she was in an accident.He would have liked to have said he didnt care about any of that, but in a town the size of Rainbow Valley, gossip took on a life of its own.He headed for the door, calling back over his shoulder, Like I said before, Ill talk to Rick in the morning to tell him where to pick up your car.Gus will tell you how to get to his place.Okay.He started out of the room only to turn back.And the next time you think about doing something like leaving your wedding and driving two hundred miles, check the weather report.I will.And for Gods sake, take the dress off first.She nodded.He left the room, then stuck his head back inside again, pointing his finger at her.And dont you evereverlet a man you dont know undress you again.Even a nondangerous one?You know what I mean.You lucked out tonight.Never forget that.Marc left her standing in the middle of the room, still clutching that dress to her breasts, and trotted down the stairs.He went straight to the bench near the front door to put his boots back on.Gus had settled into an overstuffed chair nearby, wearing a smirk that said he thought the whole thing was just a little too funny.That wasnt what you think, Marc said, grabbing one of his boots.Hey, no business of mine, Gus said.She couldnt get out of the damned dress, Marc snapped.There was nobody else to help her, so I had to unbutton it.Thats all that happened.Gus waved his hand.What my guests do is none of my concern, long as they dont tear up the place.A smile curled the corner of his mouth.Though if youd stayed all night, Id have had to charge you for a double.Gus, for Gods sake.I dont even know that woman!If I were you, Gus said, Id get to know her.She ran away from her own wedding not five hours ago.That means shes got a problem.Maybe a lot of problems.I dont need a woman with problems.Youre pretty darned picky for a man whos got no woman at all.No woman beats a crazy one.Marc pulled his other boot on.Whatever you do, dont tell Estelle.Are you saying my wifes a gossip?Are you saying shes not?Dont worry, Gus said.Your secret is safe with me.There isnt any secret!Yeah?Then should I go ahead and tell Estelle that thing thats not a secret?Oh, never mind, Marc said, standing up.Tell everybody you can think of.In fact, why dont you take out an ad in the Rainbow Valley Voice and let the whole town know?Now, I like gossip as much as the next person, Gus said.But I dont generally spend money to spread it around.You dont have to, Marc said, putting on his raincoat.Youre married to Estelle.Good night, Gus.Gus smiled.Good night, Marc.Marc opened the door and went back out into the dark, gloomy night, looking forward to the day when hed be leaving this town and all its dumb gossip behind.He wanted to go to a place where nobody knew him.Where he was a face in the crowd.Where he could misbehave all he wanted to and nobody was around to care.Wherever that place was, it sounded like heaven on earth.As for Kari, he had no idea how long she was staying in town, but he vowed to steer clear of her until she left.But just as he was getting into his truck, something occurred to him.No.Not your problem.Youre done.Go home.He started the truck, but instead of backing out of the parking space, he froze with his hand on the gearshift.A few seconds later he killed the engine again, blowing out a breath of irritation.Finally he got out of the truck and trotted back inside.Gus!Gus stuck his head around the doorway.She hasnt eaten much in the past couple of days, Marc said.Can you feed her tonight?A sandwich or something?She might not ask you herself.Sure thing.Should I put a rose on the tray and tell her its from you?Marc frowned.Good night, Gus.Good night, Marc.Marc hopped back into his truck and started for home.There.He was finally free of the whole situation.Kari Worthington had more baggage than a transatlantic airliner, and he wanted nothing more to do with her.Hed call Rick in the morning and get him to haul her car out of that ditch just as hed told her he would, but that would be the end of it.After tonight, his involvement in other peoples problems was going to be a thing of the past.Then once harvest was over he was leaving Rainbow Valley, and the freedom Nicole had grabbed for herself all those years ago would finally be his, too.Kari stood in the middle of room 302, her eyes closed and her hand still clutching the bodice of that horrible dress, trying to get her racing heart to slow down.Shed seen that mud on Marcs shirt.Before she knew it, she was touching it.Then she went from touching it to touching him.And that was when her heart started beating so crazily it took her breath away.The trouble was that shed never been known for her restraint and circumspection when it came to anything in her life, and men were no exception.Once something caught her attention, she had a hard time letting it go.And the more ill advised something was, the more she found herself focusing on it, imagining the possibilities.And the more possibilities she imagined, the more her heart sped up inside her chest until she was in serious danger of fainting dead away.Shed never been attracted to big, powerful men, but as she was standing there staring at Marc after hed gotten her out of that dress, a vision had suddenly filled her mind of a hot interlude in an out of the way inn with a sexy stranger while a storm raged outsidea wild, hot, dangerous affair that made her melt from the inside out.In the entire year shed dated Greg, not once had she felt that deep down, all encompassing, prehistoric, gotta have him now sensation that had swept through her when she stood in front of Marc.But he clearly hadnt felt a thing.He hadnt even blinked.In fact, as soon as Gus showed up, he acted as if he couldnt wait to get out of there.Oh, well.Maybe it was for the best.Should she really be lusting after one man only hours after shed left another one at the altar?With a heavy sigh, she stepped out of the dress and kicked it aside.Then she turned and caught her reflection in the dresser mirror.Her hand flew to her mouth, stifling a scream.Her hair looked as if it had gotten caught in a wind tunnel, then been doused with a bucket of water.She had dirt on her face.Mascara was everywhere except on her eyelashes.The Creature from the Black Lagoon with swampy moss hanging off him would have been more appealing than she was right then.Well, now she knew at least one reason Marc had run.What man wanted anything to do with a woman who looked like a horror movie monster?She went into the bathroom and took a long, hot shower.Then she put on her robe and plopped down in the middle of that gorgeous king sized bed.She grabbed her phone and looked at her text messages.Three were from Greg, telling her he loved her and was worried about her, and he was asking where she was.Four were from Jill, filled with her usual hyperbole.Have you lost your mind???And there were several phone messages from both of them, too.There wasnt a single word from her father.That made Kari weirdly nervous.She swore she could feel his anger radiating through two hundred miles of atmosphere to light squarely on her shoulders.Thinking about it, though, was it really so surprising he hadnt contacted her?Once when she was sixteen and stayed out past her curfew, he hadnt done what the average parent would do and just called her best friends house to make her come home.Instead, hed sent one of his uniformed security guards to pick her up.He understood quite well that teenage humiliation was a stronger deterrent than parental disapproval, and he never hesitated to use it.To this day she was still living off the warning hed given her when she was only ten years old.There are consequences, Kari.For everything you dogood and badthere are consequences.She couldnt even imagine what consequences he might be considering right now.For a moment Kari closed her eyes and imagined what this day might have been like if her mother were still alive.She remembered little else about her mother except her smiles, which shed showered on her eight year old daughter even through her last days when cancer had taken its toll.If shed been at the church today, would she have laughed and told Kari not to worry, that it was normal for a bride to have cold feet?Or would she have taken her in her arms in a loving hug and told her not to worry about the wedding, the expense, the guests, or even her fianc, that her happiness was more important than any of those things?Sometimes Kari tried to remember what her parents relationship had been like before her mothers death, but the memories were so frail and wispy that they floated away every time she tried to hold them in her mind.She only remembered the pain and anguish she felt after her mother was gone.Instead of her father filling that void for her, he seemed to distance himself more with every day that passed.Soon he stopped talking about her mother altogether, almost as if shed never existed.And now Kari wondered: Would he be the man he was today if she had lived?There was no way to know.Kari did know one thing, though.Somehow she knew that no matter what shed done today, her mother would have forgiven her.If only her father would do the same.She decided to text Greg back, just something short so at least nobody would think shed disappeared for good.Im fine, she told him.Dont worry.Ill be in touch.Please come home, he texted back.I love you.Kari didnt know if that was true or not.She only knew she felt strangely nonemotional when she looked at his words.It was as if shed already detached from him and she was talking to a stranger.She tossed her phone aside, only to pick it up again.After a moment she decided it might be wise to tell somebody where she was.Not Greg.Not her father.That left Jill.She clicked on her friends number, and after a moment, Jill came on the line.Kari!she said.Ive been worried to death about you!You dont have to worry.Im fine.Where the hell are you?If I tell you, you cant tell anyone else.But Greg  No!Especially not Greg.Or my father.Please, Jill.You have to promise me.No way.You need to come home.You need to  Jillplease.Jill sighed.Okay.I promise.Im in a town called Rainbow Valley.Its not far from Austin.Wait a minute.Im looking you up on Google Mapsoh, my God!You drove that far?Yeah.Its late.Where are you staying?At a place called Animal House.Huh?Its a bed and breakfast.What kind of name is that for a bed and breakfast?A strange one.But its a really cute place.Were always looking for a fun hotel for a girls weekend, so maybe we could  Kari!Will you focus?When are you coming home?Kari paused.I dont know.Greg is worried sick.You have to come home and get married.Jill.Please try to understand.Greg doesnt love me.And I dont love him, either.It was wrong from the beginning.No.You should see him.Hes frantic.What did my father say?Kari asked.Jill was silent for a moment.Hes worried about you, too.Kari squeezed her eyes closed as guilt crept in again.Shed embarrassed him in front of a church full of his friends, golf buddies, and business associates, and he held grudges like nobody else.Pretty soon Kari would have to face that music, but the last thing she wanted to do in the next few days was start up the band.I cant believe this, Jill said.I just cant believe you ran away from your own wedding.No.Wait a minute.Yes, I can.Youre the person who once dragged me to Cancn for the weekend with an hours notice.So why should this surprise me?I know, Kari said.I know.Its weird.But I couldnt think of anything else to do.If I had stayed, I would have ended up married.You should be married!Greg is perfect for you!No.She knew shed done the right thing.Just because Greg seemed so perfect to Jill didnt mean he was perfect for her.It had just taken Kari a long time to figure that out.Jill?Do you know he makes notes on his phone to remember to clip his toenails once a week?So hes hygienic.Whats wrong with that?His idea of a good time is to organize the apps on his iPhone.Is that really a problem?He reads the Wall Street Journal while hes going to the bathroom, Jill.Are you listening to me?Does that sound like a man Id be compatible with?What can I say?Opposites attract.No.That wasnt true.Kari was starting to realize that her relationship with Greg had been more about pleasing her father than about marrying the man of her dreams, opposite or not.But since she was only just now admitting that to herself, she didnt go there.Theres something else, Kari said.What?Well, I kinda had a little accident.Accident?Are you all right?I swerved to miss a deer, and I ended up in a ditch.I dont know the condition of my car yet.I might not be able to come home even if I wanted to.Do you want me to come get you?No!No.Please, Jill.Please.I dont want to go back to Houston yet.Kari  I have to go now.Just promise me you wont tell anyone where I am.I wont.But  Ill call you again soon.Kari hung up the phone and took a deep, calming breath.Shed go back soon.Just not now.Probably not tomorrow, even if her car was drivable.Past that, she didnt know.She knew she shouldnt be avoiding the issue.Maybe it would take a few days to fix her car, and by that time shed find the guts to jump into it, head back to Houston, and stand up to all of them.She hoped so, anyway.Just then the telephone in the room rang.She picked it up to hear Gus on the other end, who told her he could make her a quick bite to eat if she wanted it.Kari had never said yes so fast in her life.Now that she was out of that awful dress, she was hungrier than a bear coming out of hibernation.She tossed her robe aside and put on a pair of capri pants, an off the shoulder summer top, and sandals.She would have preferred a pair of jeans, a T shirt, and a pair of flip flops, but the honeymoon wardrobe in her luggage didnt include those things.On her way out the door, she sidestepped the dirty mound of lace and satin, resisting the urge to give it a good, swift kick.She hadnt liked it in the first place, but Jill and Hilda had talked her into it, telling her she looked like Cinderella.As always, shed let herself be swayed by what somebody else wanted.No more.Tomorrow she intended to find the nearest Dumpster and hurl that thing over the edge.And she vowed the next time she got married and she picked out a dress, hers was the only opinion that was going to matter.And that applied to whatever man she married, too.She went downstairs and found Gus in the kitchen.He was creating a sandwich piled high with meat, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and a whole bunch of other stuff.She climbed onto a barstool at the kitchen island, and when he finally set down the plate in front of her, it was all she could do not to stuff the whole sandwich in her mouth at once.This is really good, Kari said.Thank you.Youre welcome.Jasper walked over and sat at her feet, looking up at her longingly.I think he wants a bite, Kari said.Up to you.Kari pulled a small piece of sliced chicken from her sandwich and tossed it to the dog.He snapped it out of the air and looked for more.Thatll do, Jasper, Gus said, then looked at Kari.If he doesnt stop mooching, hes going to weigh three hundred pounds.So whats the deal with animals in this town?Kari asked Gus as she ate.The street signs.This place.Marc said you could tell me the story.Yup.It begins with the legend of the Rainbow Bridge.Ever heard of it?No.Gus leaned over with his elbows on the bar.It all started back in the 1930s with a lady named Mildred Danforth.At one time, her father owned all of Danforth County.Mildred was a spinsternever got married.She lived with her father until he died.Then she inherited all his land.With no husband, it was just her and every stray animal she could take incats, dogs, horses, wild animals, you name it.Later she deeded most of the land for the town of Rainbow Valley to be built.But there was one thing she insisted on or there was no deal.Whats that?That the valley portion of the land stay untouched forever.Mildred died a few years back, but its still against city ordinance to step foot on that part of the property.See, she believed there was something special about that valley.Special?Gus lowered his voice dramatically.She believed it was a spirit world tied to earth where animals go after they pass on.Kari smiled.Seriously?Oh, yeah.And once the animals arrive there, any disease they had is gone.They forget any abuse they might have suffered.Age is erased, too, and theyre young again.And they stay in that little piece of paradise, just playing and eating to their hearts content and sleeping in the grassy fields, until  Kari leaned forward, feeling like a preschool kid during story time.Until their human companions arrive, Gus said.And when they do, they run toward each other and have a wonderful reunion.For some reason, Karis eyes teared up.She realized if the story was true, then someday shed go to the valley and Boo would be there.Hed see her out of the corner of his eye.His head would pop up, and those tiny legs would carry him as fast as he could run toward her.Shed scoop him up and probably cry all over him.Then after they reunite, Gus said, the most amazing thing happens.What?A rainbow appears, stretching into the clouds as far as the eye can see.All the animals a person has known and loved gather with him, and together they cross that Rainbow Bridge to heaven.Kari tried to swallow the lump in her throat.No such luck.That is such a cool story.So thats why theres so much animal stuff in Rainbow Valley?Yup.Most people dont believe the legend, of course, but they cant argue with the money it brings into the town, particularly during the Festival of the Animals we have every fall.Tourists love the animal thing.She smiled.So do I.   Got a pet?A cairn terrier.Hes mostly that, anyway.I think hes a few other things, too.Where are you from?Houston.Gus shook his head.Houstons a hellhole.Crime.Pollution.Clogged up freeways.Take my word for it, honey.This is the kind of place you need to be living.Kari wasnt completely sure about that.Shed always been a big city girl.But it did seem like a really nice place to visit.So wheres the valley from here?she asked.Theres an overlook down Rainbow Way a piece.Thats the best place to get a good look at it.You cant go into the valley itself, of course.Its off limits.How about you?Do you believe the legend?He shrugged.Sure.Why not?Nobody knows what happens to us after were gone.Or to our pets.I figure thats as good an explanation as any.But do you believe the Rainbow Bridge is in this valley?I guess youre thinking, Why there?Yeah, I guess so.Maybe a better question is, Why not there?Maybe Mildred knew something the rest of us didnt.Good point.How about Marc?Kari asked.Does he believe the legend?Marc doesnt believe much of anything he cant see with his own two eyes, Gus said.But he knows tourists like it, and he likes tourists.Kari rose from the stool.Thanks so much for the sandwich.It was nice of you to think of me.It was Marcs doing.He told me you hadnt eaten much in the past few days, and he wanted to make sure I fixed you something.For the first time Kari stopped to think about just how much Marc had done for her that night.Taken her into his house.Found her car.Retrieved her luggage.Taken her to a place to stay for the night.Helped her up the stairs.Unbuttoned her dress.Asked Gus to make sure she ate something.And he was going to make sure somebody took care of her car.She remembered once how shed asked Greg to pick her up at the airport, and he made the kind of face that said she was inconveniencing him.Shed wanted to shout, Im not asking for a ride to Montana!But in the end, shed just called a car service and had a nice chat with the driver all the way from Houston Intercontinental to her apartment.But now a man she didnt even know had gone out of his way to make sure she was safe and secure, and it gave her the kind of warm fuzzies she hadnt felt in a long time.It was no coincidence, you know, Gus said.What?Kari asked.You could have gone off the road just about anywhere, but you ended up at Marcs place.That means the good Lord was looking out for you tonight.Kari was so exhausted from dragging that god awful wedding dress around for hours that the moment she crawled into that glorious king sized bed with the pillow top mattress and the softest linens on the planet, she went unconscious.When she woke the next morning, it was almost eleven oclock.She threw back the covers.My car.I have to check on my car.Half an hour later, she was heading downstairs, this time wearing a tropical print dress and turquoise sandals, more clothes from the resort wear collection in her suitcases.Gus was at the front desk.Morning, Kari, Gus said.Good morning, she said with a smile.Sorry I missed breakfast.I just couldnt drag myself out of that wonderful bed.Those linens are amazing.Estelle would love to hear you say that.They cost more than the beds did, but she insisted.Kari leaned over and gave Jasper a pat, and he gave her a happy pant in return.I need to go to Ricks Automotive and check on my car.Can you tell me how to get there?Gus gave her directions, and she said, After I see him, I think Ill grab some lunch at the cute little caf I saw on the square.She started toward the door.Uh, Kari  She turned back.Yes?Weve got a little problem, Gus said.What?I ran your credit card this morning.It was declined.Kari froze.Declined?Why?I dont know.All I know is that the bank declined the charge.Is there any reason you can think of why that might happen?No.Of course not.Theres no way She stopped short, putting her hand to her mouth.Oh, wait a minute!Yes, there is.I charged a whole bunch of stuff for my honeymoon.I probably reached my credit limit.She walked over to the desk, pulling out her phone at the same time.If youll give me a minute, I can transfer some money from my checking account, pay the card off, and then you can charge my room to it.A minute later, Kari had her account pulled up on her phone.She looked at the balance.Looked again.It couldnt be.Her account had a zero balance?No.That was impossible.There should have been thousands in there, and yet there was nothing?Is something the matter?Gus asked.No, everythings fine, Kari said, even as her stomach turned over with apprehension.Theres just a glitch of some kind.Ill give my bank a call.But Kari had a horrible feeling that everything wasnt fine.She looked up her banks telephone number and called them.She was shocked when the customer service rep told her what she already knew.She had no money.All the funds were transferred out of that account, the man said.Thats impossible, Kari said.Its my account, and I didnt touch it.There must be some mistake.No, maam.Theres no mistake.That account was emptied last night.Kari felt a rush of anxiety.Identity theft?Shed heard those commercials over and over about the dangers of somebody stealing her identity.Shed always thought maybe she should get one of those services that alerted people of any suspicious activity on their accounts, but like everything else, shed always put it off.Maybe that had been a big mistake.Im afraid somebodys stolen my identity and emptied my account, Kari said.I suppose thats possible, but in this case, I dont think so.Why not?Because it was someone with your last name who transferred the funds.My name?What are you talking about?His name is Stuart Worthington.4    Kari froze.Her father?Her father had emptied her bank account?Wait a minute, Kari said.I never authorized my father to move that money.No authorization was necessary, maam.Stuart Worthington is a signer on the account.For a moment, Kari was confused.She hadnt authorized that, either.Then she remembered.It was an old bank account, the first one shed opened as a teenager.At the time, her father had insisted on being a signer.Shed never taken his name off it.And now hed cleaned it out.But why?There are consequences, Kari.For everything you dogood and badthere are consequences.In a blinding rush, she saw what hed done.If he made sure she was broke, shed be forced to return to Houston, where hed use his overbearing influence to try to get her to marry Greg.She knew her father was demanding and domineering and just a little bit underhanded, but she never imagined hed do something like this.She hung up the phone, her mind spinning.What was she supposed to do now?Kari?Gus said.Is something wrong?Uhno.Its just going to be a little while before they complete the transaction.I hope thats not a problem.No.No problem at all.Gus smiled.Just let me know.Kari sat down in the parlor and opened her wallet, at which time she discovered she had exactly $162.54 to her name.That probably didnt even come close to what she needed to get her car fixed.It would barely pay for the one night shed stayed at Animal House that she already owed, which meant her plan to stay in Rainbow Valley until she decided what to do next had just been shot to hell.Well, look at that, Nina said, standing at the cash register and flipping through an Excel spreadsheet.Two more cases of Sex Kitten out the door.She pushed a strand of her long, dark hair behind her ear and looked at Marc innocently.Who would ever have thought it?Damned stupid name for a wine, he muttered.Most of our names are damned stupid, his sister said.But you cant argue with the bottom line.She tossed the spreadsheet aside.So you got Angela settled in the dorm?Yep.Whats her roommate like?If Ozzy Osbourne and Courtney Love had a kidthere you go.Nina smiled.So shes a little alternative?Tattoos?Piercings?Yes and yes.Dont worry.Ive met some pretty normal kids who look like that.Not around here, you havent.He went to the back room to retrieve a case of wine, while Nina rang up a customer buying an electric corkscrew.Sales had been good lately, and with the festival coming up soon after harvest, they were on track to have a record year.By the time he turned the management of this business over to Daniel, he was determined that it be in the best condition in its history.Oh.I almost forgot, Nina said, when Marc came back and the customer was out the door.Tell me about the bride you undressed last night.Marc nearly dropped the two bottles of wine he held.Where the hell did you hear about that?From Gus.He dropped in for a minute this morning.Marc was going to kill Gus.One bullet.And then he was going to turn himself in, confess, and spend the rest of his life in a five by eight foot cell in Huntsville knowing hed done the world a favor.He shoved the two bottles of wine onto a rack.She had an accident on Highway 28 last night.She walked to the house and asked for help.I took her to Animal House to stay the night.Yeah.I heard that.She smiled.And other stuff, too.She couldnt get out of her dress, somebody had to help her.That was all there was to it.Nina gave him a sly smile.I would have paid any amount of money to see the look on your face when she showed up at your door.She needed help.I helped her.Gus says shes really pretty.Shes nuts.She ran away from her own wedding.He wasnt commenting on her mental capabilities.Yeah?Well, being beautiful is worthless without a brain to go with it.Nina laughed.If any other man said that, Id call him a liar.But not you.You know how I hate chaos, and that woman has it in spades.Oh, for Gods sake, Marc.Youre so damned uptight.You need a little chaos in your life.Angela is gone.You have that big ol house all to yourself.Live a little, will you?Daniel will be home soon.Like Daniel doesnt approve of having a good time?She was right.Unfortunately, everything that was wrong with his brother started with good times.He played things loose.Shot from the hip.That was Daniel, through and through, which was why his brother fit in really well with the dot com crowd.They were a bunch of young, live for today people who never looked past the next deal.Daniel might be a millionaire right now, but it wouldnt surprise Marc if he eventually blew every penny.He shoved more bottles onto the rack.I intend to have plenty of good times.But not one of them is going to involve a crazy woman.She may have had a good reason for leaving her wedding.Did you ask her why she did it?She decided she didnt want to get married.Besides the obvious.None of my business.Think about it, Marc.How many young, eligible women show up in this town?Might want to take notice when one does.You never know when the next one might happen along.But Marc was leaving Rainbow Valley, which meant he had no intention of starting any kind of relationship with a woman, which meant Nina was barking up the wrong tree.Marcs phone rang.He grabbed it, looked at the caller ID, then hit answer.Hey, Rick.Whats up?I towed that Lexus in this morning, but the owner hasnt been by.Any idea where she might be?No.She was supposed to come by your place first thing.Took me a while to get that thing out of the ditch.Ate most of my morning.Marc sighed.Ill check on her.See where she is and get her over there.Whats the condition of the car?Not good.Theres body damage all along the right side.Itll cost thousands to fix, but I can do it.What I cant fix is the bent frame.Shell have to get an insurance adjuster out here to make it official, but trust me, that car is totaled.Marc winced.He had no idea what Kari was going to do when she found out her car was a total loss, but that was her problem.Ill get her over there soon, he told Rick.Thanks.Appreciate it.Marc hung up, letting out a breath of frustration.Where the hell was she?He thought about just calling Animal House and talking to her, but Gus would have to put the call through, and the less he was in the middle of all this, the better.Instead, Marc decided hed head over there just in case something was wrong.After all, hed been the one to ask Rick to take the time and trouble to tow Karis car in to his shop, so if there was a problem with her getting over there to get his estimate of the damage and pay him for his time, he needed to find out what it was.They would carry on a one minute conversation.It would be business, nothing more.And then hed be on his way.I have to go straighten this mess out, Marc muttered.So you are seeing her again?Nina said.I owe it to Rick to make sure this gets taken care of.Thats all.Nina smiled.Uh huh.Marc thought about biting back, but that only encouraged her to be even more of a pain in the ass.She was one of those believers in soul mates, one man for one woman, love everlasting.That was the kind of relationship she and her husband Curtis had.Ever since his death in an industrial accident a year ago, she hadnt so much as looked at another man.It was only now that shed even begun to smile again.So at least if she was bugging Marc about his love life, she was back to being the sister he remembered.Marc left the shop, walked the two blocks to Animal House, and trotted up the steps to the porch.He went inside and walked to the front desk.Gus was nowhere to be seen.Marc turned and looked across the entryway.Glancing through the parlor door, he saw a woman sitting on the sofa.She had her head in her hands and her elbows resting on her knees.She wore a dress in a bold floral pattern that was so bright it just about blinded him, with tiny straps that went over her suntanned shoulders.His gaze traveled from the spot just above her knees where her dress stopped all the way down to her sparkly blue sandals and her toenails, which were painted an iridescent pink, admiring the most beautiful legs hed seen in some time.But it was her hair that really caught his attention.It cascaded in wild waves over her shoulders like a copper waterfall.Nice.Very nice.Then she lifted her head.Good God, it was Kari.He couldnt have imagined her looking like this today when shed looked like that last night.When shed been muddy and wet, he would have had a hard time guessing her age.Looking at her now, though, he could see she was probably in her late twenties.Too young for you, he told himself, but he just couldnt seem to stop staring.So this was the woman whod been hiding under dirt and rain and that ridiculous wedding dress?Stop gawking.Youre here for a reason.But before he could go into the parlor to talk to her, he heard the door to the inn open behind him.He turned to see a man and a woman come inside.The woman was tall with blond hair pulled into a ponytail.She wore a pair of jeans and a tank top, and in her arms was a small dog that looked like a cross between some kind of terrier and a rag mop.The man wore slacks and a polo shirt, looking as if hed been heading to a country club and lost his way.Kari stood up.Jill!The woman turned at the sound of Karis voice.She let the dog down, and he ran to Kari.She scooped him up, and he licked every inch of her face, squirming like a worm on the end of a hook.Boo!Sweetie!I missed you so much!Then Jill came into the parlor, and Kari hugged them both at once.Marc had no idea who these people were, but her friends showing up could only be a good thing.Im so glad to see you, Kari said.But what are you doing here?I told you Im not going back to Houston.Not yet.I know, but  But what?Well  What?Greg came with me.The man walked into the parlor, and Karis mouth fell open.Jill!I told you not to tell him where I was!Im sorry, Jill said.But I thought you two needed to talk.I dont want to talk!No, Greg said as he walked toward Kari.We definitely need to talk.Kari hugged her dog closer and refused to look at him.He stopped in front of her.Kari, I love you, he said.Dont you know that?Kari was silent.Do you know how I felt when I realized you were gone?Im sorry about that, she said.I know it wasnt the best way to deal with it, but  Never mind.Forget it.All I want is for us to be married.I dont think thats a good idea.You thought it was a good idea when I gave you the ring, Greg said, his voice edging into impatience.And when we had our engagement party.And during our rehearsal dinner.So where along the way did it stop being a good idea?Im sorry.I really am.But She exhaled.Think about it, Greg.Are we really right for each other?Yes.
