Guys, this is Jamie Canning, my friend from way back and goalie for those punks at Rainier.Hey, I say stupidly.Then I glance around, looking for a waitress.I need a drink in my hand, even if its just a soda.But the place is mobbed, and the only server in view is nowhere nearby.I glance at the glass in Wess hand.Hes drinking something fizzyCoke, from the looks of it.No, root beer.Hed always preferred root beer.And obviously his coach gave him the same no drinking spiel.Wes raises his hand in the air, and the waitress abruptly turns in our direction.He points at his glass and she nods as if commanded by God to do his bidding.Wes flashes her a smile, his favorite currency for favors.And I notice another flash of metal.His tongue is pierced.Thats new, too.Annnd now Im thinking about his tongue.Jesus fuck.And the last four years of silence between us suddenly make a bit more sense.Maybe there are drunken antics capable of wrecking a friendship.Or maybe thats crap, and if wed stayed friends we could have gotten past an hours worth of stupidity a long time ago.Meanwhile, its really too warm in this bar.If that waitress brings me a root beer, Im going to be tempted to pour it all over myself.And the silence between my ex friend and I is growing longer by the second.Crowded, I manage.Just barely.Yeah.Need a pull?He offers me his glass.I take a greedy gulp and our eyes meet over the rim.His confidence has slipped a millimeter or two.His gaze asks a question.Are we going to make it through the next half hour?Swallowing, I make a decision.Shame the Bruins got punished by the Ducks last month.I see the flash of arrogance return at lightning speed.That was a fluke.And a terrible call in the third.Your wing tripped over his own duck feet.With a little help from your D man.Oh, fuck that.Twenty bucks says the Ducks dont make it past the first round this year.Twenty is all youre willing to bet?I gasp.Sounds like youre afraid.Twenty and a YouTube video proclaiming my greatness.Done, but when you lose, you make that video in a Bruins T shirt.Sure.I shrug.And just like that, the night gets easier.The waitress appears with two glasses of root beer and a hungry smile for Wes.He slips her a twenty.Thanks, doll.Let me know if you need anything, she says, overselling it by a shade.Christ.Hockey players dont have a lot of trouble getting laid, but my old friend obviously enjoys his pick of the litter.Shes hot, too.Great rack and a sweet smile.He doesnt even spare a glance at her perfect ass as she sashays away.After she disappears, Wes opens his arms and grins at the group of hockey players standing around him.Shit, were just a bunch of pussies, arent we?Root beer and ginger ale on a Friday night.Someone call the cops.We need a game of darts or something.Table hockey!someone calls out.Saw it in the game room.Cassel!Wes thumps the guy standing next to him.Who won our last game, anyway?You did, you prick.Because you cheated during the shootout.Who, me?Everyone laughs.But my mind snags on shootout.Of course it does.5      Wes      The college sprang for an executive suite at TD Garden, a fancy ass private box with a gleaming floor to ceiling window that overlooks the arena below.The celebratory bottles of Dom that had been delivered, however, were courtesy of my shithead father.The prick is riding the high of our win as if it had been him out on the ice this afternoonI even heard him bragging to one of his buddies that he was the one who taught me that triple deke move I used to score the winning goal in the third period.Bullshit.The old man hadnt taught me a damn thing.From the moment I was able to hold a hockey stick, he threw money at coaches and trainers and anyone else who could groom his only son into a superstar.The only credit Im willing to give him is that hes really fucking good at signing his name on a check.Cannings team is on the ice now, facing the same pressure we did earlier.Coach has allowed us each one glass of champagne.Were playing in the finals tomorrow night, and he wants us sharp.He doesnt have to worry about me, though.Im sipping on a root beer.Not just as a fuck you to my dad, but because my stomach is in knots as I watch the game, and alcohol will only make it worse.I want Rainier to win.I want to face Canning in the finals.I want to pretend I still dont have feelings for the guy.I guess Ill have to be satisfied with two out of three.Because I cant pretend Im not still into him.Seeing him again last night made that impossible.Fuck, hed looked good.Really good.All golden boy California hotness, big and blond and sexy as fuck.With those soulful brown eyessurprising on a blond guy.Its an understated sexiness, though.Jamie Canning never flaunted his looks in all the time Id known him.Sometimes I think hes not even aware of how goddamn attractive he is.Oooooh shit, one of the seniors crows as a Rainier player delivers what might be the hit of the week.Its a clean check, but it makes the opposing player bounce off the boards like a rubber ball and sprawl face first on the ice.Rainier is in it to win it.Theyre playing aggressively, all offense, all the time.I dont think Yale has taken more than a dozen shots on goal, and its already well into the third.Canning stopped all but one, and the one he let in was a total fluke of a shot, smacking off the pipe to provide Yale with a rebound the center slapped right back in.I could practically hear the hiss of the puck as it whizzed past Cannings glove, just a nanosecond too fast for him to swallow it up.The scores tied now.1 1, with five minutes to go.I find myself holding my breath, willing Rainiers forwards to make something happen.Your man Canning is rock steady, Cassel tells me, taking a dainty sip of his champagne like hes the fucking Queen of England.Cool under pressure, I agree, my gaze glued to the rink.Yales left wing just flicked a lazy wrist shot that Canning easily stops, his body language almost bored as he keeps possession of the puck before passing it to one of his wings.The Rainier players tear past the blue line, going on the attack.But my mind is still on the last goal attempt, the way Canning faced off with the Yale player.I cant even count how many times I was in that exact position, flying toward my buddy, slapping bullets at him.Except the last time we faced off, I was the one in the net.The last barrier standing between Jamie Canning and a blowjob.I like to think I didnt let him win on purpose.Im a competitor, always have been.Didnt matter how much I wanted Cannings dick in my mouth.Didnt matter that if I won, I knew Id have to let him back out of the bet.Id defended that net with everything I had.Maybe?Because when that puck flew past me, I cant deny a part of me had been thrilled.With that said, I wouldnt bawl my eyes out if they lose, Cassel says.He turns to grin at me.I know hes your BFF and all, but Id feel better going up against Yales goalie than cool cucumber down there.Cassels right.Cannings the bigger threat.Those weaknesses hed had back in the day?Gone.Hes a fucking rock star now.No wonder he got the starting job back.Even so, I dont want him to lose.I want to see him in the finals.I want to see him, period.And Ive experienced crushing defeat beforeif his team chokes, I know he wont be up for hanging out, catching up, reconnecting  Sucking each other off?I banish the thought.I dont fucking learn, do I?The last time sucking entered the equation, Id lost my best friend.Its funnyIm sure everyone has something they regret saying.An insult theyd hurled someones way.A confession they wished they could take back.Maybe, I dont know, an insensitive joke they wish they hadnt told.The one sentence I regret?Lets watch some porn.There was no turning back once I uttered those four words, and I cant even fully blame the alcohol, because a few sips from a flask does not a drunken idiot make.I knew what I was doing.What I was coaxing Canning into.I was collecting on the damn bet, which is so fucking ironic, because hed won.The prize was his, except it wasnt.It was mine.Because Id wanted to touch him more than Id wanted my next breath.I still remember the shock on his face when I loaded the porn site on my laptop.I chose a tame scenetame for me, anyway.I set the laptop on the mattress, then sprawled on the bottom bunk as if I had no care in the world.For a long moment Canning didnt move.I waited, tense, while he decided whether or not he was going to sit next to me on my bed, or climb up to the top bunk.Without looking at him, I passed him the flask.I heard him gulp.He swallowed on a sigh, then parked his ass beside me.I didnt risk a look at him for several minutes.We lay on our backs, passing the flask back and forth as we watched two dudes double team a busty blonde on the screen.How would you compare your technique to hers?Canning cracked himself up with this quip, his stomach shaking even as he looked at the laptop.To him, it was just the latest amusing result of our competitive shenanigans.He was going to lord it over me, the way we always did with each other.But to me, it was no joke.Id just spent the last year trying to accept my increasingly obvious attraction to men.The bumbling loss of my virginity to a chick during junior year had been a pretty big red flag.I hadnt been attracted to her, but Id needed to try it.To be certain.Id barely been able to get it up, and even then, Id managed only because I was thinking about  Canning.I thought about Jamie Canning.Id been crushing on my straight best friend for a long time.But I couldnt tell him that.My only move here was to play along.Well, Ive always been good at stickhandling.Jamie snorted.Only you could be cocky even about this.I always tell you, Canning.No fear.No matter what.God, I was such a jackass.Because fear wasnt even part of the equation.All I had was a pure, aching desire as I lay there beside Jamie.Last year Id enjoyed a couple of drunken make out sessions and a hand job exchange with a guy from school.But even then, I hadnt been one hundred percent sure.Lying in bed next to Canning?I burned with certainty.On the screen, the blonde was moaning like crazy.Spit roasted and loving it.Canning went quiet for a while.I lay there, trying to keep my breathing even.But I couldnt resist sneaking a peek at his crotch a minute later.And then my breath hitched, because holy shit, he was hard, a long, thick erection straining beneath his athletic shorts.I was sporting the same visible boner, and I know he saw it.He probably thought it was the porn.Hell, that was the only reason he was turned on.Not me, though.My dick throbbed for him.Beside me, he swallowed roughly.Interesting pick, Wesley.Considering the stakes.Im not gonna force you to blow me.He grinned.Id rather bask in the glory of knowing you finally wrote a check you couldnt cash.Then he rolled his gorgeous eyes at me, and it only made my skin burn hotter.What, I said, hoping he couldnt hear the rasp of lust in my voice, You think Im too chicken shit to blow you?He turned his chin to meet my eyes  Fuck yeah!Our team captains shout jerks me out of my trip down memory lane.The whole arena is in an uproar, fans screaming as the scoreboard lights up and the screens mounted all over the place flash the word GOAL!in huge yellow letters.My stomach drops like a sack of bricks when I realize who scored.Yale.Fucking hell.Yale scored, and Id been too distracted to see it.Its 2 1 now, with a minute and a half to go.I spaced out, I tell Cassel.What just happened?One of the Rainier D men took the stupidest penalty Ive ever seen.He shakes his head in amazement.Idiot just handed Yale the win.No, they havent won yet.Theres still time for Rainier to regroup.Still time, damn it.Your boy didnt stand a chance on that power play, Cassel adds.My gut twists harder.Say what you will about Yale, but they lead the NCAA in capitalizing on power plays.Every time we played them this season, Coach uttered one grim sentence before we left the locker roomYou wind up in the sin bin against Yale, you lose.I pray those words arent prophetic, that Rainier can come back from this, but my prayers go unanswered.The final buzzer blares through TD Garden.And Rainier loses.6      Jamie      We lost.We fucking lost.Im still dazed as I trudge down the chute toward the locker rooms.The mood all around me is somber.Suffocating.Nobody is playing the blame game, though.Theres no anger directed at Barkov, who tripped the Yale forward for no comprehensible reasonthe guy didnt even have the puck.Theres no recrimination toward our defense, who inexplicably fell apart during that power play.And theres no accusation aimed my way, for not being able to stop that last shot from lighting the lamp.But, insideI blame myself.I shouldve stopped it.I shouldve dived faster, extended my arm farther.I shouldve hurled my body on that damn puck and not let it get anywhere near the crease.Numbness sets in.Id been bummed my family didnt make the trek from Cali to watch me play.Now Im grateful they didnt see me lose.Except on television.Along with a few million other people  Damn.Back in our hotel room, I find Terry sitting on the bed, clicker in hand.But the TV is off, and hes watching a black screen.Um, Terry?You okay?He looks up fast.Yeah.Just The sentence dies an early death.The next several days are going to be just like this.I can see it now.We wanted so badly to be the ones who brought this title home to Rainier.It would have proved to our families and the college that all these years of sacrifice were worth it.We proved nothing.Its still the winningest season in thirty years, Terry says slowly.I flop onto my bed.Is winningest a word?Not if youre us.We both laugh.But his laugh ends on a sigh.That was my last game, Canning.My very last one.Im not an NHL recruit like you.Three months from now Im wearing a suit and sitting at a desk.Shit.Thats really grim.For fifteen years Ive been a hockey player.As of a half hour ago, Im a junior associate in the investment banking division of Pine Trust Capital.Jesus.And now Im hoping our hotel room windows arent the kind that open, because Im half afraid hes going to step out onto a ledge.Or else I will.Dude, you need alcohol and a girl.Like, yesterday.His chuckle is dark.My cousins are on the way over here to pick me up.There will be drinking and titty bars.Thank Christ.I roll over to study the pebbled hotel room ceiling.You know, theres a very real chance I never play a single NHL game.Third string goalie?Detroit might as well make a bench to my asss exact measurements.If Im lucky theyll let me play backup to their farm team goalie.Youll still have the jersey and the puck bunnies.His phone rings and he swipes to answer.Born ready, he tells the caller.Ill be right down.Then to me, You coming with?Am I?I definitely need a drink.But at the moment, my back is plastered to the bedspread.Im not ready, I admit.Can I text you in an hour, see where you are?Do it, he says.Later, I call out as the door clicks shut.For a little while I just stew in my own misery.My parents call my phone, but I dont pick up.Theyll be awesome, as always, but I dont want to hear nice, encouraging words right now.I need to feel bad.Get drunk.Get off, maybe.Theres a firm knock on the door and I haul my sorry ass up to answer it.Probably a teammate, ready to help me with the getting drunk part of tonights activities.I yank the door open to find Holly standing there, her face smudged with orange and black paint, a bottle of tequila in one hand and limes in the other.Surprise, she says.Jesus, Holls.I laugh.You said you werent coming.I lied.She gives me a big grin.I open the door wider.Youve never had better timing in your life.Really?she challenges, pushing past me.Not even the time I got you off in the bathroom of the train right before our station stop?Okay, maybe then.I am so happy to see her its not even funny.Distraction is what I need, and thats what Holly and I have always been to one another.She gets down to business, cutting limes on the hotel table with a knife shes pulled from her purse.Do I know how to pick my friends, or what?Glasses, Holly orders over her shoulder.I think I could go straight for the bottle tonight, but for her sake I look around, finding a pair of them on the console by the TV.I plunk em down and shes pouring before I know it.Here.She offers me a glass and raises another in the air.To kicking ass and getting over our disappointments.Her wide blue eyes study me, looking for something.Thats a good toast, pal, I murmur.Thank you.When I touch my glass to hers, she grins like shes won something tonight.That makes one of us.Bottoms up, hunk.Then Im stripping you naked.I like the sound of that.The tequila slides down, and then I let her stick a lime in my mouth.Were both chuckling and sucking down the sour citrus flavor.Then I give her a nudge onto the bed.Id like to freaking unleash all my tensions on this smiling girl, but I take a deep breath.Holly is kind of a peanut and half the time Im worried about crushing her.My knees are on the bed now, and shes scooting back, shucking off her shirt.My own shirt hits the floor before I lower myself over her body, taking care to hold most of my weight off of her.Except for my hips.Those sink decadently onto hers, and my dick wakes up and says, lookee what we have here.Holly grabs my head and pulls me down for a kiss.I taste lime and tequila and willing, happy girl.Mmm, she moans.Ive been waiting all day for this.So was I, its just that I didnt know it.My eyes slam shut and I sink down into her mouth and this beautiful place of forgetfulness.Theres no game and no goal just before the buzzer.Theres no disappointment.Theres only a sexy girl beneath me and some more shots to drink.And a knock on the door.Fuck, Holly and I grunt in unison.Canning!a voice calls from the hallway.Wess voice.The sound of it pulls me out of the moment.Do you have to?Holly pants.I kind of do, I whisper.But only for a minute.I swear.Fine, she huffs, pushing on my chest.But Im pouring more tequila.You are awesome, I insist, reaching down to the floor for her shirt.I ignore mine in the interest of time.The second shes covered, I cross the room and open the door.Hey, I greet Wes.I expect him to launch into a tough luck spiel.Wes is competitive as fuck but hed never kick me when I was down.Oddly, though, he stays silent, blinking at me from the hallway.Hey, he echoes after a long pause.I just  No more words are forthcoming.He takes in my half dressed look, and the sight of my fuck buddy pouring tequila.Thats Holly, I say quietly.Holly, this is an old friend, Ryan Wesley.Shot?she offers from across the room.Shes flushed, and her hair is mussed.Im probably in the same state.But Holly doesnt seem embarrassed, so I dont worry.Wes, you coming in?No, he says quickly, and the word sounds like a chip of stone falling onto a hard surface.I just wanted to tell you that Im sorry were not facing off tomorrow.He shoves his hands in his pockets in a rare display of humility.Wont be the same now.The corners of his mouth turn up, but the smile doesnt make it to his eyes.I know.My voice is full of all the disappointment Id been hoping to escape tonight.Not like camp.Loved that place, Wes says, reaching up to rub the back of his neck.I still coach there, you know.Id meant to end this conversation already, so I have no idea why I add, It isnt the same without you.Its true, but this is already the most emotionally loaded day of my life, and I really dont need more to think about.Im going to head out, Wes says, jerking a thumb toward the elevators.You, ah, take care of yourself if I dont see you tomorrow.He takes a step backward.Thats the moment when I really dont know what to do.My team will head back to the west coast in the morning.We wont stay for the final.Im not sure Wes and I have more to say to each other right now.But is this really it?I feel a strong urge to add somethingto delay his departure.Except Im beat and confused and so fucking spent.And hes already turning away from me.Later, I say gruffly.He looks over his shoulder to raise one hand in a wave.I stand there like an idiot a moment longer, and he turns the corner toward the elevator banks.Jamie, Holly says softly.Heres your drink.Reluctantly, I shut the door.I cross the room, take the glass from her and pound it.She slips the empty tumbler from my hand.Now where were we?If I only knew.7      Wes      You know we just won the national title, right?Cassel says for the hundredth time in the past hour.He wears the goofy, king of the world grin hes been sporting all night.Even before the four vodka shots he threw back.Yeah, I know.My tone is absent as I sweep my gaze over the crowded, overheated bar wed chosen as celebration headquarters.The drinks at the hotel bar are ridiculously overpriced, so we decided to venture somewhere else tonight.And according to Donovans Yelp search, this tiny dive bar has half price drinks on Sunday nights and apparently they dont taste like piss.I dont give a shit how the alcohol tastes, though.Im only interested in the effects of it.I want to get drunk.I want to get shit faced out of my mind so I dont have to think about what a total fucking idiot I am.Cassels voice drags me out of my bleak thoughts.Then quit sulking like a bitch, he orders.Were national champions, man.We crushed Yale tonight.We fucking shut them out.We did.The final score had been 2 0, Northern Mass.Wed wiped the ice with our opponents, and I should be happy about that.No, I should be goddamn ecstatic.Its what we trained all year for, yet instead of savoring the win, Im too busy bumming out about the fact that Canning has a girlfriend.Yes, folks, Jamie Canning is straight.Shocker.Youd think Id have learned my lesson by now.I spent six years hoping that maybe the attraction wasnt one sided.Maybe one day a switch would suddenly go off and hed be like, hmmm, Im totally into Wes.Or maybe he would figure out he swings both ways and decide to take a walk on the dude side.None of those maybes had panned out, though.And they never fucking would.All around me, the guys laugh and joke and recap their favorite moments of tonights game, and nobody notices Im not saying anything.My mind keeps wandering back to Jamie and his girl and the hook up Id interrupted last night.We need another round, Cassel announces, searching the main room for our waitress.When I spot her behind the counter, I abruptly scrape back my chair.Ill go order it, I tell the guys, and then I dart away from the table before anyone can ask why Ive suddenly become so charitable.At the bar, I order another round of shots for the group, then rest my forearms on the splintered wooden counter and study the liquor bottles on the shelves.Ive been drinking beer all night, but its not getting the job done.I need to be drunker.I need something harder.My gut tightens when my gaze lands on a gleaming bottle of bourbon.My fathers drink of choice.But the bourbon he buys is a thousand times more expensive than the bottle on this shelf.I shift my gaze to the row of tequila bottles.Canning had been drinking tequila last night.My gaze moves again.Jack Daniels.Aw hell.Its like every bottle in this fucking bar is full of memories.Before I can stop it, my mind flashes back to that last day at camp, to the silver flask Id passed Canning, and the mocking question Id hurled his way.You think Im too chicken shit to blow you?Hed seemed to consider me for a minute.I think its a bad idea to ever say that Ryan Wesley is too chicken shit to do something.True dat.He chuckled, but his eyes went back to the screen.Again, he let me off the hook.But I didnt want to be let off.I wanted to get off.The longer we sat there discussing sex, the more certain I was.Touching my best friend was all I could think about.It wasnt a dare for me, either.It was pure desire.On the screen, the blonde was on her knees, sucking one of the guys while jacking off the other.Jamie took another sip from the flask before passing it my way.Beside me, he shifted his hips, and I had to suppress a shudder.My hearts desire was sitting beside me.And now he was horny.His hand had moved, resting just above the waistband of his shorts.He gave the spot beneath his abs the tiniest of caresses, like he had an itch, but it was obvious hed been hoping to do some strategic rearranging.I swallowed a mouthful of whiskey.For courage.Then I put a hand between my legs, just resting it there.This is killing me, I said.It was the most truthful statement Id made all day.I took a slow stroke down my hard cock and then back up again.I could feel his eyes on me, on my hand.And that made me even crazier.Forget the screen.Id rather star in my own solo act right here, with my favorite pair of brown eyes as the only audience.My heart started to pound, because I knew what I was about to do.Theres this cliff at the swimming hole we liked, a twenty foot drop into the lake, and that night, it was like I was standing atop it.Like I was creeping toward the edge and pulling him with me.I remember one year when Canning was taking so long to jump Id lost patience and pushed him off, cackling as I watched him windmill down to the water below.But I couldnt do that this time.I couldnt push him.He had to jump.I licked my dry lips.I really need to jerk.You mind?His moment of hesitation practically killed me.Go ahead.We shower in the same room, right?Hell.He chuckled.We crap in the same room.Though theres walls.There werent any here.I shoved my hand under my waistband and gripped my aching shaft.I didnt whip it out, though.Just gave it a slow tug beneath my shorts.His eyes had filled with surprise, then flashed with something that sucked the breath right out of my lungs.Not anger.Not annoyance.Arousal.Holy hell, he was getting off on seeing me jerk it.And neither of us was looking at the laptop now.Cannings gaze stayed glued to the slow movement of my hand beneath my shorts.You can, too.I hated the gravelly sound of my voice just then, because I knew that I had an agenda.Go ahead.Itll be less weird for me.Hell.I was like the serpent shoving the apple at Eve.Or rather the banana  All the bad analogies fled my stupid brain a moment later when Jamie reached into his shorts and pulled his dick all the way out.My heart shimmied in my chest at the sight.He was pink and thick and perfect.With the fingers of one hand he stroked the undersideup and down.The lightest touch.I envied those fingertips.I cupped my aching balls and tried to take a deep breath.My chest was tight from wanting him.He was right therehis hip touching mine.I wanted to bend down and take him in my mouth.I wanted it so badly I could taste it.His eyes went back to the screen.I felt him sink a little further back into the bed.We were both stroking in earnest now.His breathing became shallower, and the sound of it sent another shot of lust up my spine.I wanted to be the one making him pant like that.But then his pace faltered, and I looked up to find out why.The video had ended.Id chosen a clip that was only a few minutes long.And now the screen had frozen on a menu of clips, but the thumbnail photo displayed most prominently was this awful shot of a womans giant ass.Um Jamie actually chuckled.Thats not getting the job done.I felt a sort of awareness settle over me then.In hockey, when a shot opens up, a good player has to react immediately.Thats exactly what was happening here.A window of opportunity had cracked open a sliver, and I was going to dive through it.You could call in your bet, I croaked.Stroking himself, he let out a hot breath.You daring me to?Yeah.His throat worked as he swallowed.His eyes flickered with a parade of emotions I couldnt keep up with.Reluctance.Heat.Confusion.Heat.Irritation.Heat.I He laughed, his voice hoarse.He stopped, cleared his throat.Double dog dare you.His gaze locked with mine again and I almost came right there and then.My cock had swelled in my hand, pulsing.Aching.But somehow I managed to put on a careless tone, my trademark up for anything drawl that half the time is a total front.Well.This should be interesting.The faint hint of panic on his face was unmistakable, but I didnt give him time to back out.I wanted him too much.Id always fucking wanted this guy.Releasing myself, I reached over to cover his hand with mine.He tensed, and for a split second I thought he was going to push me away.I wouldnt have blamed him.But then he let go, leaving my hand there alone.And I was holding his dick.Finally.He was hot and hard, and the ends of his soft blond pubic hair tickled my fingertips.I squeezed, and all the air seemed to drain out of his body, his torso practically melting into the mattress.My mouth was a desert, my pulse a loud drum in my ears.I stroked my palm along that hard shaft, acting like what I was doing was no biggie.Then I said, Fuck, I think Im drunk.Because that seemed like the right thing to say.Like alcohol was the reason we were doing this.Alcohol was our hall pass.It worked, because he choked out, Me too.But his voice was smoky and distracted.And maybe he was drunk.Maybe the flush on his cheeks was all thanks to the whiskey and not from the feel of my other hand yanking his shorts down further.Maybe his breathing quickened because alcohol was surging through his bloodstream and not from my fingers curling around his shaft.I shifted on the mattress, kneeling in front of him as I pumped him in slow strokes.My entire body throbbed with uncontrollable need, my erection heavy between my legs.I ignored it, though.Jamie blinked twice when I rose above him, and I watched his face, gauging his reaction.He didnt look horrified.He looked turned on.Id been fantasizing about this moment for years.Couldnt believe it was really here.What are you waiting for, Ryan?Suck it already.Surprise jolted through me.He only called me Ryan when he was taunting me.And right now he was taunting me about sucking his dick.Jesus.My bravado faltered, just for a second.Until I saw his pulse hammering in the hollow of his throat, and realized he was as nervous and excited as I was.I took a breath and lowered my head.Then I closed my mouth over his swollen tip and sucked.Jamies hips snapped up instantly, his breath leaving his throat on a ragged shudder.Oh Jesus.I remember wondering if hed ever been blown before.The shock and awe in his voice had been so raw.So sexy.So Id wondered, but not for long.Not when he started whispering the hottest, filthiest commands at me.More, he muttered.Take more.Take it all.I sucked him deeper into my mouth, almost to the base, and just when he moaned, I released him, gliding my tongue along the long, hard length of him until his dick was glistening.I lapped at the moisture leaking out of his tip, and the taste of him infused my tongue, making my head spin.I was blowing my best friend.It was so surreal.It was what Id dreamed about for so long, and the fantasy was nothing compared to the reality of it.Fuck, yeah.Cannings hips began to rock as I took him in my mouth again.I licked the crown of his cock, teasing, savoring, then taking him deep again.I didnt dare peer up at him.I was too afraid to look him in the eyeafraid hed be able to see on my face how much I wanted him.Jesus, Wes, youre way too good at this.The praise just lit me up.Holy hell.He was thrusting into my mouth because I turned him on.His fingers suddenly tangled in my hair, tightening when I swallowed him as far as I could take him.Oh Christ.Keep doing that, man.Let me fuck your mouth.Every husky thing he said practically made me go up in flames.I knew I would enjoy this.But if he was too?Mind bending.I quickened the pace, squeezing his shaft on every upstroke, tighter than I thought hed like, but he kept muttering harder, faster.My eyes squeezed shut as I worked him over, determined to make him lose control, to make him feel the same urgent need wreaking havoc on my body.Wes A choked sound left his lips.Fuck, Wes, youre making me come.His fingers pulled my hair to the point of pain, his abs tightening as his hips rocked faster.A few seconds later, he groaned.The husky sound vibrated against my lips as he went still, thrust deep, and came inside my mouth while I swallowed up every last dro  You hoping one of those bottles holds up a little sign for you and says order me?A male voice jolts me back to the present.I blink, disoriented.Im still at the bar, still standing at the counter and staring at the liquor bottles.Shit.Id totally spaced out.And Im semi hard now, thanks to the memory of my last night with Jamie Canning.Gulping, I turn to find a smiling stranger beside me.Seriously, he adds, his smile widening.Youve been eyeing those bottles for almost five minutes.The bartender gave up on trying to ask you what you wanted.The bartender had talked to me?He probably thinks Im a total weirdo.The guy next to me doesnt look like a weirdo, though.Hes really good looking, actually.Late twenties, wearing faded jeans and a Ramones T shirt, a full sleeve tattoo covering his right arm.Tribal shit, mixed with skulls and dragons and some other badass imagery.Hes skinnier than I usually like, but not anorexic thin.Not entirely my type, but hes not not my type, either.Hes definitely hook up material, and from the way hes checking me out, I know hed be down.You with those guys?He gestures to the table of hockey jackets.I nod.Whatcha celebrating?We won the Frozen Four tonight.I pause.College hockey championship.No shit.Congrats, man.So you play hockey, huh?His gaze lingers on my chest and arms before sliding back to my face.It shows.Yeah, hed be down.I glance at the table, where Cassel catches my eye.He grins when he notices my companion, then turns back to the guys, laughing at something Landon just said.So whats your name?my stranger asks.Ryan.Im Dane.I nod again.I cant seem to muster up any charm.No cocky remarks, no blatant come ons.I won a championship game tonightI should be celebrating.I should invite this very attractive guy back to the hotel, hang the do not disturb sign on the door so Cassel gets the hint, and screw Danes goddamn brains out.But I dont want to.Id just be trying to screw Canning out of my system, and I know Id feel like shit after.Sorry, gotta get back to my boys, I say abruptly.Nice chatting with you, man.I march across the bar before he can say another word.I dont turn around to see if he looks disappointed or to make sure he isnt following me.I just tap Cassel on the shoulder and tell him Im taking off.Its another five minutes before Im able to convince him I havent been abducted by aliens.I plead a headache, blame it on the adrenaline and the beers and the temperature and everything else I can think of, until finally he gives up on coaxing me to stay, and Im able to leave the bar.Its twenty blocks back to the hotel, but I decide to walk instead of cabbing it.I could use the fresh air and the time to clear my head.Except now Im ten blocks into the walk, and my head still isnt clear.Its fogged in with images of Canning.I cant stop picturing the way he looked last night.His sexed up hair, the flush on his cheeks.Hed either gotten laid or had been about to.And the chick had been hot, a tiny little pixie of a girl with big blue eyes.Hed always gone for the petite ones.Gritting my teeth, I force the girl out of my head and think about the goodbye Canning and I shared.The place isnt the same without you.It had sounded like hed meant that.Hell, he probably had.Wed spent the best summers of our lives at Elites.Obviously one BJ hadnt wrecked all the good memories for him.I shove my hands in my pockets as I stop at a crosswalk and wait for the signal to turn green.I wonder if Ill ever see him again.Probably not.Were both graduating, about to start our post college lives.Hes on the west coast; Im heading north to Toronto.Our paths arent likely to cross.Maybe thats for the best.Two measly encounters this weekend, just two, yet somehow theyd managed to erase the four years Id spent getting over him.Its obvious I cant be around Canning without wanting him.Without wanting more.But this weekend wasnt enough for me, damn it.I grab my phone before I can stop myself, halting at a newspaper dispenser and leaning against the metal box as I pull up a web browser.The site takes a while to load, but once it does, it takes no time to get to the contact page.I skim the staff directory until I find the phone number for the camp director.He knows me.He likes me.Hell, for the past four years hes been hounding me to come back.He would do me this favor if I asked him.I click on the number.Then I hesitate, my finger hovering over the call button.Im a selfish bastard.Or maybe Im a fucking masochist.Canning cant give me what I want, but I still cant stop myself from wanting it.I want whatever I can geta conversation, a joke gift, a smile, anything.I might not be able to have the steak, but fuck it, Im fine with some scraps.I just I just cant let him go yet.8      JUNE      Jamie   Hey, Canning?Yeah?Pat, the camp director, has come over to the penalty box to talk to me.I dont take my eyes off the scrimmage Im coaching, but he wont think Im rude.Got you a roommate, he says.Really?Thats good news, because every summer Pat scrambles for coaches.And this year is no different.Guys like me keep graduating and moving on.He wants the best coaches at his camp, but the best guys are in high demand.This year Im one of those.Im due in Detroit for training camp six weeks from now, which means Pat will have to find someone to fill in for me when I go.I glance at him for a split second before looking back at the boys game in progress.Hes sizing me up, and I dont know why.Be nice to him, okay?It takes me a moment to answer, because I dont like the direction the scrimmage is taking.Tempers are about to flare.I can feel the tension mounting.When am I not nice?I ask, distracted.A firm hand lands on my shoulder.Youre the best there is, kid.Although your goalie is about to lose his shit.I can see that.Its like watching an accident.I know whats about to occur, but forces are already in motion and I cant stop them.My best goalieMark Killfeatherhas stopped twenty shots in this scrimmage already.With quick reflexes and a big, agile body, Killfeather has all the physical traits a good goalie requires.He also has, unfortunately, a lightning quick temper.And the talented French Canadian forward on the other team has been playing him like a fiddle all daytaunting him and teasing him on every offensive push.I see the play the Canadian is about to make.He passes back to his buddy on the blue line then takes the puck again as the other sides D men get hung up in the corners.He fakes left, then rightand sends a flying saucer past my man Killfeather.It is a beautiful play until the Canadian kid sprays the goalie with ice shavings and calls him un stupide.As if it were a boomerang, Killfeather throws his stick with enough force to crack it like a matchstick against the boards.It falls onto the ice, splintered.Check, please.I blow the whistle.Thats the game, were out of time.Pourquoi?protests the aggressive forward.Zhere is time on zee clock!Debrief with your offensive coach, I say, waving him off.Then I skate over to Killfeather, who stands panting in the net, helmet yanked off to reveal his sweaty head.He is only sixteen and looks it.While other kids his age are kicking back under the sun or playing video games, hes spent his hours duking it out on the rink today.Id been that kid, too.It was a good life and I wouldnt trade it for anything, but it helps to remember these are still kids.So I dont open with, Hey asshole, you just trashed a hundred dollar stick.Whos your favorite goalie, kid?I ask instead.Tuukka Rask, he says immediately.Good pick.Im not a Bruins fan, but the man has an excellent record.What does his face look like after he lets in a goal?Killfeather quirks an eyebrow.Why?He just takes a drink and puts his mask back on.He doesnt lose his shit and throw his stick, I say with a smile.The kid rolls his eyes.I get that, but that guy is such an ass.Leaning down, I tug the net off its spike so the ice can be resurfaced.You did great goaltending today.Truly exceptional.Killfeather begins to smile.But you have to learn to keep your cool, and Im going to tell you why.His smile fades.Rask is calm after he messes up.But its not because hes a better person than you or me, or because he meditates or never gets mad.Its because he knows that putting it all behind him is the only way to win.Seriouslywhen hes having that gulp of water, hes already moved on.Instead of saying, Man, I wish I hadnt done that, hes saying, All right, now I get a brand new chance to stop him.The kid is scowling at his skates now.You know that thing they say about goldfish?Their memories are so short that each time they swim around the bowl, its all brand new again.The corners of his mouth lift up.Thats deep, Coach Canning.Aw.It kills me to be Coach Canning for a few weeks a year.I freaking love this job.Be my goldfish, Killfeather.I give him a little punch on the chest pads.Forget every stupid thing that guy says to you.Because the world is filled with dicks who will rile you up for fun.Youve got the moves.You can do the job.But only if you dont let him wreck it for you.He finally looks up at me.Okay.Thanks.Hit the showers, I say, skating backwards away from him.Then get your credit card out and buy another stick.I leave him, unlacing my skates and slipping into my Chuck Ts.When youre the coach, you dont have to gear up.Just skates and a helmet.Im wearing hiking shorts and a Rainier College sweatshirt.And they feed me three meals a day in the camp dining room.Did I mention this is a sweet job?Leaving the rink takes me past every kind of Olympic sports memorabilia.The rink where I stood a minute ago trying to talk some sense into a sixteen year old goalie is the same ice where Team USA won Olympic gold in 1980.So there are Miracle on Ice pictures everywhere.During the winter months, there are more athletes per capita in this little town than most anywhere.People move here to train for hockey, skating, ski jumping and alpine events.But when I push open the glass doors, its a warm June day.Mirror Lake glitters in the distance and I have to shield my eyes.The town of Lake Placid is five hours from New York City or Boston.The closest real city is Montreal, and thats still two hours away.Smack in the middle of nowhere sits this cute little touristy town surrounded by unspoiled lakes and the Adirondack mountain range.Heaven.Unless you need airport access.But today I dont.Im walking past a ski shop and an ice cream parlor, measuring the hours until dinnertime.I have a lot of nostalgia for this town, probably because its mine.When youre the youngest of six kids, nothing is ever just yours.I think thats why I went out for hockey in the first placemy family is all about football.No Canning had ever set foot in the Adirondacks until I was invited to this camp.In fact, leaving the family cuckoos nest to come here as a teenager felt like venturing to the moon.Its four oclock, and theres time for a run or a swim, but Ill need to change clothes.All the campers and coaches are housed in an old dormitory that was built to accommodate European athletes for the 1980 winter Olympics.The building is a five minute walk from the rinks.As I jog up the steps I pass a plaque that describes the original occupants and the medals they won, but I dont stop.Spend a few years in this town and you forget to be impressed.My room is on the second floor, and I always take the stairs instead of the creaky old elevator.The dim hallway smells of floor wax and the lilacs blooming outside.Plus a whiff of old socks.You cant have a building full of hockey players without that.I am ten feet from my door, keys in hand, when I realize someone is standing stock still beside it.That alone is enough to startle me.And then I realize who it is.Jesus Christ!I still go by Wes, he says, pushing off the wall.Or Ryan.Or jackass.Are you Im almost afraid to say the words, because hes shut me out for so long now.My roommate?I open the door to my room to give my hands something to do.A surge of joy builds low in my stomach.Just the idea of another crazy summer with Wesleyit cant be true.Well His voice is uncharacteristically cautious.And since light from my open door spills into the hallway, I can see his face properly for the first time.Hes worried.That jaunty jaw is tucked low, and his eyes dip when I study him.Weird.I push into the room and fling my keys onto my bed.Im about to go running.Feel like a jog?You can fill me in.I assume youre coaching for Pat, or you wouldnt be here.He nods.But when I strip off my shirt, he jams his hands in his pockets and turns away.We have to talk, though.Okay.About what?We can do that while were running.Unless youre getting fat since your big victory?He snickers.Fine.From out in the hall he grabs a big duffel bag.Pat just said something to me at practice about finding me a roommate.He meant you, right?He was just pulling my chain?With his back to me, Wes nods.Then he yanks his faded T shirt over his head.And Jesus Christ, hes enormous.Tattoos and rippling muscles as far as the eye can see.Id forgotten we were really only boys the last time we stood here together.Teenagers.Feels like yesterday.Nice room you got here, he remarks as he changes into a wife beater and gym shorts.Its true.Instead of bunk beds, weve got twin beds built into the walls.And theres a comfortable expanse of floor between them.The coaches get a little more breathing room.Ive been living it up in here the last three years.He spins around.Who do you room with?Whoever.I drop a wicking shirt over my head and then toe into my running shoes.Tying them takes only a few more seconds, and Im anxious to get out of here and run.Maybe Wes will stop acting like a weirdo and just tell me whats on his mind.Lets go?He gives his bag a kick.Im going to leave this here.Where else would you leave it?He winces, and I dont know why.9      Wes      Outside, Jamie heads toward Mirror Lake, and I follow him.How many times have I run this loop with him?A hundred, at least.Remember that summer when we said wed do five miles a day, no matter what?I ask.Hes put us on an easy pace as we head away from the dormitory.Sure do.Then we had that hot day with two practices and weightlifting.But you said, We still have to do the run, or the summer wont count.
