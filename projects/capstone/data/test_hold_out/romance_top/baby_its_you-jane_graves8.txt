Her father?Marc said.Is that who sent you here?When the guy lifted his chin a scant inch and narrowed his eyes, Marc had his answer.He couldnt believe it.But after Karis father had tried to get her to marry a complete asshole and then cleaned out her bank account when she wouldnt return to Houston, should Marc really be surprised?What did he hire you to do?Marc asked.The guy paused, clearly trying to decide how much to say.Finally he shrugged nonchalantly.Nothing much.Just keep watch on his crazy daughter and report back.That son of a bitch.What did you tell him?That his daughter is keeping company with a certain vineyard owner who cant seem to keep his hands off her.She graduated pretty fast from that cottage right up to the big house, didnt she?If Marc had been angry before, he was livid now.Clearly that one night outside the cottage wasnt the only time this guy had been at the vineyard.The very idea of this bastard spying on the two of them was more than Marc could take.Your assignment just came to an end, Marc said.I want you out of this town tonight, or you and I are going to have a talk with the sheriff.Fine with me.I was getting tired of this shitty little town anyway.Though I gotta say I wasnt getting tired of watching her.He nodded toward Kari.From what I could tell, youve been watching her plenty yourself.You heard me, Marc said.Leave town.Now.Sure.Im out of here.But just between you and me, I know Stuart Worthington.And hes not going to stop until his darling daughter is back in Houston and under his thumb again.The guy gave him one last go to hell look and sauntered off.Marc was glad Stuart Worthington wasnt standing in front of him right now.If he was, he might just have to put his hands around his throat and never let go.Marc watched the guy walk away, then turned and strode toward the Bomb.Kari got out and met him halfway.I saw you talking to him.Who is he?Hes a PI.She looked stunned.A private investigator?Why would he be following me?Because your father hired him to.Oh, no.Oh, yeah.Was he the guy outside the cottage that night?Looks that way.Hes probably been your fathers eyes and ears in this town ever since the asshole got back to Houston and told him you refused to come back with him.You mean hes been watching me the whole time?Hes been watching us the whole time.Kari closed her eyes.Im sorry, Marc.GodIm so sorry.Its not your fault.No.It is.Ever since I showed up on your porch that night, Ive been nothing but a problem for you.You had to give me a place to live.A car to drive.Then there was that mess with Angela.And now all this with my father.I wouldnt blame you if you put me on that bus to Houston, and this time you made sure I stayed on it.No.I dont want you on any damned bus to Houston.For some reason, tears filled her eyes.Whats the matter?he asked.Nothing.I just  Just what?Thank you, she said.For what?For wanting me here.I dont know where Id be right now if it werent for you.A tear trickled down her cheek, and she wiped it away.Ive never had a job that my father didnt give me or didnt help me get.Im not proud of that, but its the truth.The job at RosiesI know its not much, but I did it myself, and that means something to me.I know youre still helping me with everything else.But eventually Ill stand on my own two feet.I promise you I will.I know you will, Marc said, leaning in to give her a kiss.But what he didnt tell her was that if something else happened, something insurmountable, something so hard to handle that she needed his help, he intended to be right there for her.No matter how hell bent Stuart Worthington was on getting his daughter back to Houston, Marc had news for him.Hed do everything in his power to ensure Kari stayed right where she was.The next Sunday morning, Kari sat on the deck with Marc, feeling the cool September breeze swirl around them.Kari flipped through her Kindle while Marc scrolled through one weather app after another, and it occurred to her that shed never felt so happy to be anywhere in her life.The dogs were in the yard, doing what dogs didrunning, sniffing, fake growling, and rolling in the grass together.You know Brandys in love with Boo, Kari said.What do you think?Are they too young for a real relationship?I just want to know why good girls always fall for bad boys.Boo is not bad!He barfs on the floor.Knocks over trash cans.Gnaws on chair legs.Shall I go on?But hes good at heart.Kari leaned in and gave Marc a kiss.So whats the weather report?Clear skies for the next five days.Theres a storm front brewing in the west, but its supposed to swing north.Isnt it about time for harvest?Kari said, hating to ask the question.Harvest meant everything was going to change for all of them, so she wasnt looking forward to it.Yep.I have the crew scheduled for the first of next week.And right after that, Marc would be leaving.That meant their time together could be measured in days now rather than weeks.If only he would stay  That thought came into Karis mind, and just as quickly she sent it packing.No sense hoping for something that was never going to happen.Instead, she needed to be enjoying every moment they did have together.Do you realize in all the time Ive been working at Rosies, you havent been there during one of my shifts?she said.Is that right?Thats right.Why dont you come over for lunch tomorrow?Ill have Marla seat you in my section.Ill show you how I can sling hash.Rosie doesnt serve hash.Must you be so literal?And I promise not to dump coffee in your lap.Now, theres a selling point.Come to Rosies.We wont give you second degree burns.Bring Brandy, Kari said with a smile.I have a dog biscuit with her name on it.Marc nodded toward the dogs, who were lying together in the sun, panting happily.Ill have to check her schedule.She may already have a date.Kari couldnt wait for Marc to come to Rosies.She felt so good these days about her job.Yeah, it was still hard, and she was still exhausted at the end of every shift.But she found out that when she stuck with it, it got easier, and she had actually started to enjoy going to work.But she enjoyed going home to Marc even more.At noon the next day, Marc parked his truck in a space on the square so he and Brandy could head to Rosies.As he started to get out of the truck, his phone rang.When he saw Angelas caller ID, his heart skipped a few beats.He hadnt heard from her since the disaster the other night, and he wasnt completely sure what to say to her now.He took a deep, calming breath and punched the button to answer the call.So how are things going?he said.Okay.Did you have that talk with Kim?Yeah.I talked to her.And?And she told me she doesnt care if I dont like her staying up late and bringing friends over.She says Im too uptight, so its my fault theres a problem.Well, shit.Can you change rooms?Its too late for that.If you want to change now, you have to get a letter from God.Well, its your room, too.Have you talked to your resident advisor?Maybe she can talk to Kim.Oh, right.Like thats going to solve anything?Itll only piss Kim off.And then she really will be awful to me.Marc started to say, Come on, Angela!Thats bullshit!Didnt I teach you to stand up for yourself?But he could hear that shaky, on the verge of crying tone in her voice, so he knew hed better shut up.Youll be here Sunday for Shannon and Lukes wedding, right?he asked her.Yeah.Ill be there.Id never miss Shannons wedding.Kari offered to fix dinner for the family after the wedding.Silence.And it dragged on so long Marc wondered if hed lost the connection.Oh, Angela said finally.So shes still there?Yes.Will you stay for dinner?I dont know.I probably need to get back to school.I have a sociology test on Monday.Come on, Angela.Id like to see you for a little while.Yet another long silence.Then a heavy sigh.Okay.Ill come to dinner.Marc felt a surge of relief.Good.Thats good.I know Uncle Daniel wants to see you, too.And Aunt Nina.Well have a nice time.Whatever.That word frustrated the hell out of Marc, because she acted as if she didnt care about any of this when he knew she felt exactly the opposite.He couldnt even imagine what Sunday was going to bring.After he said good bye, Marc stuck his phone back into his pocket, and he and Brandy got out of the truck.As he was walking inside, he happened to see Luke coming out of the hardware store down the street.He had Fluffy on a leash.Marc waved, and Luke approached.Plumbing parts, he said, holding up the bag in his hand.I hate plumbing.Whats the problem?Leaky faucet.Shannon tried to fix it.Shes good at a lot of things.Plumbing isnt one of them.And now you get to fix her fix?Exactly.Let me know if you need some help.Thanks, Luke said.Here for lunch?Yeah.Want to join me?Shannons expecting me back at the shelter, but whats thirty minutes?A mans gotta eat, right?A few minutes later, Marla seated them in a booth by the front window.The dogs circled and sniffed, then lay down beside each other.Marc looked over to see the kitchen door swing open.Kari came out, carrying a plate in each hand and baskets on her arms.She saw Marc and gave him a smile as she delivered the food to the family in the next booth.Then she swept by their booth and gave each dog a pat on the head and a dog biscuit.Hi, Luke!Kari said, standing back up.I didnt know you were going to be here, too.She took out her order pad.So whats it going to be, guys?Chicken fried steak, Luke said.Kari wrote down the order, then turned to Marc.Double cheeseburger, he said.Got it.Do you want that zombiefied?As Marc was trying to figure out what she could possibly mean by that, Gloria breezed by.Definitely get the zombie version, she told Marc with a wink.Its so worth it.Then by all means, Marc said, feeling totally lost but loving the smile on Karis face.Coming right up, Kari said with a gleam in her eye.Then she hurried off to give another diner his check.Marc watched her walk away, thinking how goofy she looked wearing blue capri pants with her pink apron and Angelas beat up sneakers.But even looking goofy, he swore she was still the most beautiful woman hed ever seen.He finally dragged his gaze away and looked back at Luke.So how are things going?Pretty soon youll be a married man.Luke smiled.Its about time.Shannons obsessing over the wedding.Her mothers obsessing even more.But to tell you the truth, its the honeymoon Im interested in.Where are you going?San Antonio.Were just getting a suite at a nice hotel for several days.Shannon doesnt want to stay away from the shelter any longer than that.But Im going to make sure that at least while shes on her honeymoon, she forgets all about it.Smart man.Your harvest is coming up soon.Are you really leaving after that?Yep.Luke shook his head.Were sure gonna miss you.Ive been planning this trip for years.Never thought the day would come.Thats a hell of a business youre leaving behind.Hell is right.A vineyard is nothing but blood and sweat for the things you can control, and a lot of hope and prayers for those you cant.I need a break.Daniel will handle things.Daniel will handle things.Marc had said those words to himself so many times he thought he actually believed them, but saying them out loud turned out to be a very hard thing to do.What about Angela?Luke asked.I doubt shell come back here after college.She wants to be a vet.This town already has one and probably cant support another one.Luke nodded.What was it like?Marc asked.Traveling the country on the rodeo circuit?Luke shrugged.Pretty good for a while.Drinking.Partying.Whats not to like about that when youre twenty years old?A woman in every city?Just about.Then Lukes smile faded.After a while, though, I think I was pushing so hard for the championship that I didnt notice when it stopped being exciting and started being a hard, lonely life.Marc couldnt imagine loneliness like that.All he could see was peace and quiet and the freedom to do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.Sometimes responsibility is like a noose around your neck, he said.I love my daughter.Shes just amazing.But raising a kid is hard.Raising a kid by yourself is even harder.Over the years Ive wondered what Ive missed by doing that.Sometimes freedom isnt all its cracked up to be.Yeah, but Im sure going to give it a shot, anyway.If you want to leave that bad, you should do it.But I gotta tell you, Marc.Ive been both places.And now all I want to do is stay.Thats because you have Shannon.So find yourself a good woman.He nodded toward Kari.I see a certain little redhead you cant seem to keep your eyes off of.Suddenly Marc heard applause.When he turned around, he saw Kari standing on a chair.What was she doing?Balancing a spoon on her nose?He wasnt sure how, but that spoon stayed there as if shed superglued it.She held her arms out in a ta da!pose.After several seconds of showing the trick to everybody in the place, she grabbed the spoon off her nose and bowed deeply, and the crowd erupted with more applause.Shes something else, isnt she?Luke said.Marc couldnt have agreed more.As she handed out spoons for everybody in the place to try the same trick, she glanced over at Marc and gave him a wink.She was crazy.Hed known that from the first time she knocked on his door.But when he looked at her now, he didnt see anything wrong with that.He saw a woman who loved life, who enjoyed people, who made friends easily, who had injected the kind of light in his life hed totally overlooked all these years.Then she turned toward the front of the caf, and all at once her broad, beautiful smile fell into a look of dismay.Marc spun around to see a tall, stout man standing at the door.He looked to be about sixty years old, wearing a pair of sharply creased slacks, a buttoned down shirt, and dress shoes.His salt and pepper hair was set into a rigidly conservative style, and judging from the heavy downward creases at the corners of his mouth, he looked as if he hadnt smiled a day in his life.And when Marc looked out the window and saw a black Mercedes sedan parked at the curb, he knew who the man must be.Every muscle in his body tightened with anger.What was that bastard doing there?15    When Kari saw her father at the door of the caf, the incongruity was so overwhelming that for a moment she thought it couldnt possibly be him.She wondered how long hed been there, but judging from his expression, hed seen her spoon on the nose trick.She was instantly filled with the same humiliation shed felt so many times in her lifethe kind of humiliation only her father could heap on her with a single frigid expression.She took a deep breath and walked across the restaurant.Dad?What are you doing here?May I have a word with you?he said.Before she could respond, he turned and walked out of the caf.Kari paused for a moment and looked at Marc.His eyebrows were pulled together and his eyes narrowed in anger.That told her he knew whod been standing at the door, and she read his thoughts as clearly as if hed shouted them.Its your father.Somethings up.Do you need me?Its okay, she said, moving just her lips, even though she wasnt sure it was going to be okay at all.She left the caf and followed her father to his car.His driver opened the back door.She got in, and her father followed.The interior of the car was so quiet Kari could hear the blood rushing through her ears.And in that moment she realized how much she associated the smell of the rich leather upholstery with negative feelings, and a single whiff nearly made her sick.She couldnt believe this.Her father had driven all the way from Houston to see her.That had to mean something.Maybe it meant he would acknowledge her self sufficiency, give her money back to her, and maybe tell her he was sorry.Oh, right.Had her own wishful thinking ever gone her way where her father was concerned?Ever?He looked her up and down, focusing on her pink bib apron.So this is what youve been doing for a living?His face was all hard planes, with a bullish nose and eyes so impenetrable that Kari felt as if she were talking to a stranger.Yes.Your job is waiting for you in Houston.I have a job.No.This isnt a job.This is what uneducated, uncultured people do in order to feed themselves.Is that what you want to be associated with?I like it here.He sighedthat bone weary, long suffering sigh intended as a wordless reprimand.There had been times in her life when that alone had intimidated her enough that shed stopped being herself and started being whatever her father wanted her to be.Id hoped the older you got, the more youd get this kind of nonsense out of your system, he said.Apparently that hasnt been the case.I dont want to go back to Houston.And I dont want to marry Greg.Forget him.If he couldnt hold on to you, he doesnt deserve my money.So that was all this was to her father.A game played for money.He dangled millions in front of a man to see if he could be the one to control his wayward daughter, and when he failed, he was out the door.The very thought of that made Kari dizzy with despair.But was she really surprised?Didnt she know it already?I thought it was possible Karis voice trailed off.You thought what was possible?She nearly choked on the words, but she had to say them.That you might be proud of me.Her father raised a single eyebrow, tilting his head with disbelief.Proud of you?For being paid a pittance to entertain the masses by balancing a spoon on your nose?I fail to see the accomplishment.Im taking care of myself.By waiting tables and living with a man?AgainI fail to see the accomplishment.Kari felt as if she were ten years old again, looking for any chink in her fathers wall of disapproval.But now, like then, she saw nothing.She wasnt looking for total approval.She wasnt looking for a pat on the head.She just wanted some acknowledgment that maybe she was doing something at least marginally admirable by sticking it out and running her own life.And just so youll know, her father went on, Marc Cordero is hardly a wealthy man.That vineyard barely affords him a decent living.How do you know that?Kari, please.Is there anything on this earth I cant find out if I want to?I dont care whether he has money or not.Her father shook his head with disgust.After your upbringing, how can you stand living like a pauper?Id have an easier time if you gave me my money back.As Ive always told you, there are consequences to everything you do.That money will remain with me until you come to your senses.Then Id be happy to return it.Consequences.God, how she hated that word.Im still in the middle of my shift, she said, clasping her hands together to keep them from shaking.I need to get back to work.I could buy that place, Kari.With a single swipe of my pen, I could own it.Karis heart skipped with apprehension, because she knew her father wasnt just blowing smoke.Rosie would never sell.Everybody has his price.If you buy this restaurant, she said, her voice trembling, Ill quit.Her fathers expression slowly turned ugly, and his voice took on an undercurrent of fury.I gave you everything a person could want or need in this life.A decent upbringing.A college education.A position at my company.A wedding not one in ten thousand women will ever have.And this is how you repay me?Thats the point, Dad!You gave those things to me.You never asked me what I wanted!And there was a reason for that.If youre given the opportunity to have what you want, this is where you end up.With that, every last bit of the pride shed felt at finally getting near the point of self sufficiency evaporated.She knew he was angry.But if they could just talk a little when the anger subsided, maybe hed see her point of view.Maybe that awful expression on his face would finally melt into a smile, and hed tell her that after thinking about it, maybe he did feel just a little bit proud of her.Like I said, Kari told him, I have to go back to work.But maybe we can talk again later.There are a few inns in town.Maybe you could  Enough!Karis heart slammed against her chest.I dont allow anyone to disrespect me, her father said.No one.Not friends, not business associates, and certainly not my own daughter.He sat back and took a deep, silent breath, letting it out slowly, regaining his composure.But still the anger was there, laced around the edges of his voice.If you forget this nonsense and come back to Houston, he said, Ill overlook all this.But if you stay His face turned to stone.Youre not my daughter any longer.Kari was stunned.Those wordsthose horrible, dismissive wordsshe couldnt stand the sound of them.For all her fathers criticism, his manipulation, his disapproval, shed always thought deep down that he loved her.He had to love her, didnt he?Didnt all fathers love their daughters?Now she knew it wasnt true.It couldnt be true, or he wouldnt be talking to her like this.He was the one person on this earth who should have loved her and protected her and stood up for her.Instead, he did everything he could to tear her down into a meek, helpless waif of a woman without a shred of self respect.She was hovering in that terrible realization that he intended to hold a hard line no matter what.That nothing she did was ever good enough, and it never would be, making her feel more lost and alone than she ever had in her life.Then she looked through the side window of the car into the caf and saw Marc staring back at her.He was so strong, so sure of himself.It radiated from him even at this distance, and just looking at him made her feel a burst of courage and resilience.She knew it was only a matter of time before he left Rainbow Valley, before she couldnt count on him being there every day for her, making her feel strong and self sufficient.But it was because of him that maybe she could do what needed to be done right now.She looked at her father, and this time her words came out with strength and conviction even though her hands were shaking and her stomach was in turmoil.Then I guess Im not your daughter any longer.Her fathers hard, expressionless face never changed.Well, then.Youve left me no choice.He nodded toward the car door.Get out.In spite of everything she knew about her father, she still couldnt have imagined those words coming out of his mouth, and her heart crumbled to dust.In a daze, she turned and opened the car door.Stepped out.Closed it behind her.Her stomach felt like shattered glass, but she kept walking.Even when she heard the car pull away, she didnt look back.She just kept walking toward the door of the caf, but now tears clouded her eyes so much she wasnt even sure she was walking in the right direction.She had the sense of Marc jumping up from the booth with Brandy at his heels and hurrying out the door.He caught Kari as she reached it, and she collapsed in his arms and her tears spilled out.Kari?What happened?What did he say to you?Kari opened her mouth, but she couldnt speak.Didnt want to speak.Didnt want to verbalize just how awful her father had been to her.All she could do was cry.It was as if every lost, lonely moment of her childhood had built up inside of her, and now every one of them was being released in a torrent of tears.Get in my truck, Marc said.The Bomb  Leave it.Ill bring you back in the morning.I cant.I have to close out.My checks.I have to  Stay here.He sat her down on one of the outdoor chairs, handed her Brandys leash, and went back into the caf.Looking through the window, she saw a tear clouded image of him talking to Rosie.Rosie nodded, and Marc came back outside.Lets go, he said.Marc helped her to her feet.He put his arm around her shoulders and led her to his truck.All the way there, the terrible words her father had spoken to her circled around and around in her mind until she thought shed go insane with misery.When they got into Marcs truck and Kari told him what her father had said, Marc decided Stuart Worthington was one lucky son of a bitch not to be within his reach right now.If he had been, Marc would have ripped him to shreds.Its been this way all my life, Kari said.Oncejust onceI wanted to see something from him.Something that said he gave a damn.Now Marc knew.Now he knew the full extent of why shed let herself get caught up in an engagement she didnt want with a man who would have only made her life miserable.She was dying for love from a father there was no way to please.I miss my mother, she went on.God, Im twenty eight years old, and Im telling you I miss my mother.She died when I was eight.Im supposed to be over that by now.Im supposed to be over it.But how do you get over that?Marc thought.When in anyones life do they stop looking for love?Tell me about her, he said.I barely remember her, really.When I think about her, all I see in my mind is green eyes like mine and a soft smile.I was eight when she died.Its hard to remember stuff from when youre eight.She paused.No, I do remember something.I remember how that smile went away any time my father came into the room.Why did she marry him?She came from a broken home.Parents divorced.Her mother sweated blood just to keep their heads above water.It must have felt like such a relief for her to marry a man with money.But she traded a lot in return for that.My father likes controlling people, and my mother was no exception.But I think she would have done anything to keep from having such a hard life.She let out a heavy sigh.Maybe Im a lot like my mother.Ive always settled for somebody else running my life.No, Marc said.Not anymore.Youre doing the right thing, Kari.No matter what your father says, theres honor in good, honest work, and what youre doing is just that.Dont listen to him.What kind of father tells his daughter shes a fool for trying to stand on her own two feet?I know.But hes still my father.The only family I have.Yeah, a few distant relatives, but essentially, hes it.Do you know what it feels like to have no one?Marc wanted to say, You dont have no one!You have me!But did she really?He was leaving soon.Was he supposed to tell her she could count on him when he might be hundreds of miles away?Do you like living in Rainbow Valley?he asked her.Yes.Are you going to stay?Yeah, she said.I think I am.This is a good town.Good people.Youre going to be just fine.Kari nodded, but he could tell she didnt quite believe it.Suddenly that day he was going to ride off into the sunset seemed more like a curse than a blessing.Wait a minute.Ride?He didnt have a clue how to help Kari forget all this crap with her father, but he did know something that would make her feel better.Lets go to Ricks Automotive, he said.Kari blinked.What?He started his truck.I promised you a ride on my motorcycle.Hell have a spare helmet you can borrow.How about it?When is your next day off?Friday.Have you covered shifts for anybody who could return the favor on Saturday so you could be off then, too?I can ask.Why?Because then we can go to Fredericksburg.We can leave Friday.Stay over until Sunday.Visit some vineyards there.I have a few friends whod be happy to see us.How does that sound?What about the vineyard?Daniel is there.Hes supposed to be handling things, so Im going to let him do it.Wait.Luke and Shannons wedding is Sunday.Well be back in plenty of time.Their wedding isnt until four oclock.I have to be back early enough to cook.Nina, Daniel, and Angela are coming to dinner after the wedding, remember?Dont worry.Well come back as early as you need to.A tiny smile came to Karis lips.Then lets go.Kari had forgotten how much fun it was to feel the landscape whizzing by and the roar of the engine, and all her thoughts about her altercation with her father seemed to melt away.But the best thing of all was being able to circle her arms around Marcs waist and just hang on for the ride.Then about thirty minutes away from their destination, the strangest thing happened.Her stomach began to swirl with nausea, and her head felt light and dizzy.At first she thought maybe shed eaten something that hadnt agreed with her, but she couldnt imagine what that might be.Unfortunately, it felt like motion sickness.This couldnt be happening.Shed never had that problem when shed ridden a motorcycle before, but there was no doubt it was happening now.As long as she looked at the horizon it wasnt bad, but if she closed her eyes the dizziness overtook her again.By the time they got to Fredericksburg and pulled into the parking lot of the motel, it was all she could do to get off the bike and stand up straight.She put her hand to her stomach.You okay?Marc asked.Yeah.Just a little motion sickness, I think.Its been a while since Ive been on a motorcycle.Im fine.She forced a smile and followed him into the motel office, where a grandmotherly woman greeted them and gave them keys to their room.The moment Marc closed the door behind them, he took her in his arms and kissed her.Then he swept her up in his arms and laid her on the bed, his eyes blazing with the kind of sexual desire that made her feel like the most beautiful woman on earth.He made love to her slowly and leisurely, as if they had the rest of their lives to do it.Before they left Rainbow Valley, Marc had called two vineyard owners he knew to tell them they were going to be in Fredericksburg, and they set aside time for private tastings.Marc and Kari spent the afternoon sipping the different wines in beautiful surroundings, and she loved it.But mostly she loved hearing Marc talk about the industry with the other vintners.Mold and pests and bottling processes and harvest timing were fairly mundane things, but their conversation was filled with enthusiasm and passion and laughter.She could see the respect other vintners had for Marc, and watching the light in his eyes when he talked about Cordero Vineyards absolutely mesmerized her.She was glad shed learned as much as she had about wine making in the past several weeks, and a few times she actually asked well informed questions the other vintners were happy to answer.And as Marc talked, his hand would stray over and rest on her thigh, and then hed turn and look at her with that smile that said he was in his element and having a good time, but also that he was glad she was there with him.Karis mind grew a little fuzzy from the few glasses of wine she had, but all her sickness earlier had passed, and it made her feel warm and wonderful.And by the time they headed back to the motel, she knew for a fact it had been one of the best days of her life.The next morning when Marc woke, morning light filtered through the blinds, casting stripes of warm sunshine across the bed.Kari lay on her side, her fist curled beneath her chin.Soon she stirred and shifted to her back.The covers fell away, exposing her soft, heavy breasts.Marc watched them rise and fall with every breath she took.Had he ever seen anything more beautiful?After a moment, he reached up to stroke one fingertip softly across her nipple.Back and forth, back and forth.She was still asleep, but as her nipple rose and puckered, she began to stir beneath his touch.He rose on one elbow, closed his hand around the base of her breast, and squeezed gently.Her nipple rose enticingly.He dipped his head and flicked his tongue across it.She squirmed left and right, a soft whimper rising in the back of her throat, a tiny, plaintive cry that made his cock leap and harden.Half awake now, she threaded her fingers through his hair and flexed her fingertips against his scalp.He closed his mouth around her nipple, applying suction at the same time he flicked his tongue.She squirmed beneath him as if it was too much, but at the same time she held him in place and arched her back, asking for more.She kicked off the covers, pulled one knee up and let it fall to the side, her breath coming faster.He stroked his hand along her inner thigh, and her escalating breaths became hot and heavy, her moans beginning to sound like pleas.Now, she said.Now what?Inside me, she murmured.Now.Impossible.Hed woken her from a sound sleep less than two minutes ago, and she was already ready for him?Just like that?Finding that hard to believe, he slid his fingers between her open thighs.She was hot, swollen, and wet.If hed been hard before, he was granite now.Hed never been the kind of man who needed frequent ego boosts, but he had to say he was enjoying this one.Marc.Now!Yes, maam.He fumbled across the nightstand, snagged a condom, ripped it open, put it in place.Seconds later he plunged inside her.Her groan of satisfaction almost made him come right there.Easing in and out of her, slowly, deliberately, then plunging in again.She lifted her hips with every stroke, pushing against him, taking him as deeply as she could, begging for all he could give her and then some.He pushed her right to the edge, and as she fell, he fell along with her.Afterward, they lay together in satisfied silence.Marc thought back to the years when he was so overworked and stretched so thin he nearly snapped, and he wondered what it would have been like if hed had somebody to share things with the way he did with Kari.Just somebody he could talk to at the end of the day to share the good and the bad.He didnt need anybody to fix anything.But if hed just been able to talk, to open a valve and let off a little of the pressure, things wouldnt have felt so insurmountable.And if that somebody had been a woman like Kari, whose ever present smile and gentle touch soothed him in other ways, how different might his life have been?He told himself it could have been any woman whod wandered along at this point in his life and hed have felt the same, but it wasnt true.It was Kari.She was the one he couldnt wait to be with.He traced his fingertip along her cheek, then pushed a lock of hair behind her ear.Crazy idea, he said.You cant have a crazy idea, she said.Youre not a crazy person.You made me a crazy person.So come with me.Not a problem, she said with a smile.Ill follow you anywhere.To the sofa, to the shower  How about from Los Angeles to Chicago?Kari froze.What?You like to ride, Marc said.How about coming with me when I leave Rainbow Valley?Thats crazy.Didnt I just say that?Kari was stunned.I thought this was just a casual thing.You know.No strings.What could be more strings free than a road trip on a motorcycle?Her first thought was, Oh, thank God.Im not going to have to say good bye to him.But that didnt mean any of this was forever.It was precisely because she was asking nothing of him that he wanted her around.If she asked for more, she had the terrible feeling shed end up with nothing at all, because the last thing he wanted was to be tied down.But how many times in the past several days had she looked at him with longing, wishing for that moment hed suddenly turn around, realize he belonged at Cordero Vineyards, and want to stay there forever with her?I grabbed this from the lobby, Marc said.Look here.He opened the nightstand drawer and pulled out a map of the United States.He opened it and pointed out the highway from Los Angeles to Chicago.This is old Route 66.Thats how you see the country.Not on the interstates.On the back roads.So heres what Im thinking.First we head to Los Angeles.Maybe hang out at the beach for a week or so.Then we hit Route 66.We can ride the whole distance to Chicago.We can do it as fast or as slow as we feel like it, and stop anywhere along the way we want to.But thatll take weeks.I have three years.Whats a few weeks?What about my job?I dont have any money unless I work.Its barely more expensive for two to travel instead of one.Ill pay for everything.Believe meRosie has a hard time finding good help.Youll always have a job there later if you want it.Let me do this, Kari.Id love it if you came along.What about Boo?she asked.Daniel will take care of him.Whats one more animal around there?Of course, the house will be chewed to pieces when we get back, but what the hell?Kari smiled, even though she didnt feel happy.He wanted her to be with him, which was a dream come true.But in that dream, they werent on his motorcycle.They were living at Cordero Vineyards.That was the scenario she played in her head when she was in the shower, driving to work, falling asleep in his arms at night.In the end, though, it didnt matter.Wherever Marc was, that was where she wanted to be.Then she had a terrible thought.Shed gotten so sick when shed been on his bike yesterday.What if she couldnt ride long distances without that sickness coming back again?No.She wasnt going to worry about that.There were remedies for motion sickness.She simply wasnt going to accept the thought of not being able to leave Rainbow Valley with Marc.She was not going to accept it.Or maybe you want to stay in Rainbow Valley, Marc asked.I know youve gotten to know people, and you do have your job.Youve worked hard for that.So if you dont want to go  Come on, Marc.Like you dont know Im half crazy?I dont want to be tied down any more than you do.Trust me.If its between staying in Rainbow Valley and hitting the road on a motorcycle, which do you think Im going to pick?Thats exactly what I wanted to hear.His brilliant smile made the entire room glow, but Kari could barely contain the desperation she felt.Marc wanted freedom, and she knew if she told him she wanted anything else, the last thing shed see of him was his back as he drove out of town.An hour later, they got back on his motorcycle to go home.As they headed down the road, at first Kari felt fine.Then nausea crept in, and she had to focus on the horizon to keep from feeling really sick.The panic she felt about that didnt help.What if this happened every time she sat behind him on this motorcycle?If she couldnt ride from Fredericksburg to Rainbow Valley without getting dizzy, how was she supposed to go across the country with him?By the time they crossed the city limits into Rainbow Valley, she felt so dizzy that if she hadnt had a death grip on Marc, she might have gone tumbling right off the back of the bike.As they came around the last bend and she saw the Cordero Vineyards sign in the distance, she was filled with relief.Deep breath.Itll be over in a minute.As they approached the driveway leading to the house, Marc pulled his motorcycle to a halt to allow a party rental truck to pull from the driveway onto the highway.Luke and Shannons wedding was only a few hours from now.Undoubtedly Nina was putting the finishing touches on the arbor for the ceremony and the decorations for the reception.Marc brought his bike to a halt and let the truck pass.Then Kari was surprised to see another car coming down the drive.Whos that?Kari asked.Dont know.Marc waited on that one, too.As it turned onto the highway, she saw a magnetic sign on the side of the car that read, Morgan Tank and Equipment.Marc muttered a curse.I cant believe this.Whats wrong?Kari asked.I need to have a word with my brother.16    A minute later, Marc stormed into the kitchen, where Daniel sat at the table poking at his phone.Marc.Youre back.Yeah.Im back.Tell me what a rep from Morgan Tank and Equipment was doing here.Daniel froze.Then he looked back down at his phone with a careless shrug.Just talking.Talking?What about?Daniel tossed his phone aside.You know what about, so why are you asking me?Werent you listening when I told you how I feel about micro oxygenation?Oh, come on, Marc!Will you get with the program?Technology is the future of wine making.Its not this vineyards future.Were a boutique winery.Our selling point is the care we give to every grape we pull off a vine.You start applying technology to what we do, and we lose our competitive edge.Old school, Daniel said.You need to keep up.Keep up?Marc said, his voice escalating.You havent lived here for ten years, and Im the one who needs to keep up?Theres a big world out there, Daniel said.Hard to keep up with when youve never stepped foot out of Rainbow Valley.I havent stepped foot out of Rainbow Valley, Marc said, his voice quivering, because I was operating this vineyard while you were running all over this country doing whatever the hell you pleased.Whatever I pleased?Whatever I pleased made me a fucking millionaire!Why do you always act as if thats nothing?Im not going to let you run this place into the ground.Thats not going to happen.Ill be the judge of that.Yeah?Well, you cant do a lot of judging when youre on the back of a motorcycle heading out of town.Now as Marc envisioned that, he saw it more as a trap than freedom.Hed be in another state while Daniel was here screwing up the business their father had entrusted to him, and that was absolutely intolerable.If youre so damned worried about this place, Daniel said, why are you leaving?Just because Im leaving it doesnt mean I dont care what happens to it!I dont know, Marc.I think you give up that right the minute you put it in my hands and hit the road.So that was what it came down to?If he handed this place over to Daniel everything went to shit, and if he didnt, he was destined to be here forever?Right now were stuck with oak barrel aging, Daniel said.But as soon as Im in charge, there may be a few new procedures at Cordero Vineyards.Damn it, Daniel, Ive sweated blood over this place!Right.Because youve always been desperate to live up to the old mans expectations.Well, hes dead and gone.Its your life now.Why dont you live it?We had a deal, Marc said hotly.Dont you dare try to back out now!Im not backing out.Just because I decide to do things a little differently  Youre going to destroy this place!Oh, come on, Marc!A vineyard is always one bad season away from closing its doors.It could happen whether youre running it or I am.You really dont give a damn about this place, do you?If I sell it, no big deal.If a mold infestation takes out our crop, who cares?If you put micro oxygenation tanks in and destroy a whole years work, so what?If we lose this crop, well miss an entire vintage.Itll take us years to recover from that!Assuming you decide not to sell.Either way its a disaster.If we lose a crop, do you know what that does to the market value of this place?I depend on it for a living, or at least I need to be able to cash out the equity.Have you even stopped to think about that?Do you actually think Id let you swing from the end of that rope?Daniel said.Seriously?What are you talking about?If I make the wrong decision, if things go south, Ill pay you for the crop.Ill write you a check.And you know I can do it.You wont be out a dime.Its not about the fucking money!When are you going to get that through your head?Then what the hell is it about?You say its your livelihood.How is that not about money?And that was when Marc knew.His brother was never going to be able to do this.It just wasnt in him.He could learn how to operate machinery.How to prune grapevines for maximum production.But that didnt give him the heart for the business, the drive, that feeling of pride when he looked out across the vineyard and imagined the final product, bottled and ready to drink.Never mind, Marc said.Lets just get the grapes in on Thursday, and then  No.They need to stay on the vine at least another week.Another week?You leave them on the vine that long and the sugar level will go through the roof.I dont think so.And the tannins will also be softer.The alcohol content will be too high.Did you test the pH?You told me I have the best palate of anybody in the family.So why dont you just let me taste the damned grapes and decide when to harvest?No.Lets get it done.The crew is booked  I rescheduled for next week.You what?You want me to run this place?So let me run it.Marc was dumbfounded.He couldnt do this anymore.He couldnt listen to his brother ignore every procedure theyd ever established at this vineyard and simply shoot from the hip.He just couldnt do it.You know what?Marc said.Fine.Do whatever you want with the place.Harvest when theres so much sugar in the grapes they taste like candy.Use fake oak flavoring.Hell, burn the place to the ground.I dont give a shit.Its all yours, buddy.Were harvesting in a week?Fine.Ill bring my shears.The minute those grapes are in, Im out of here.Then you can deal with the aftermath.Kari truly believed Luke and Shannons wedding was the most beautiful one shed ever seen.The late afternoon sun eased through the tree branches, dappling the whole area with clusters of sunshine.Friends and family gathered in front of the grape arbor to watch two people they all loved promising to love each other for the rest of their lives.This is it, Kari thought.This is the way its supposed to be.After Marc and Daniel fought World War III earlier, Daniel moved out of the main house into the cottage.Angela showed up with only minutes to spare and avoided talking to Kari, coming to sit next to Marc only when the ceremony was about to begin.Marc didnt touch Kari through the entire ceremony, and she knew it was because Angela was sitting right next to him.Angela stared straight ahead the whole time, her face tight and unsmiling.Even when Shannon and Luke exchanged rings and became man and wife, her expression never changed.Kari could only imagine what was going on inside her head.Nina and Daniel sat to Karis left.Daniel checked his phone at least three times during the ceremony, and Nina seemed to be in another world.Her gaze never strayed from that arbor, and as fond as she was of Shannon and Luke, Kari knew she was thinking about Curtis.When Luke kissed his bride, Nina began to cry, and she had to pull a tissue from her purse to dab beneath her eyes.The reception took place in the barn next to the oak barrels, where Nina had set up tables with linen tablecloths and wine themed centerpieces.Candles on the tables lit the room with a warm glow.And Shannon looked positively radiant.Kari had been to a lot of weddings before, but there was something about the way she and Luke looked at each other that made Kari feel a sense of envy well up inside her.That was the wrong thing to feel, she knew, because she was truly happy for them.But she couldnt stop wondering if there would ever come a day when a man would look at her the way Luke looked at Shannon.Then she glanced up at Marc, and the most frustrating sense of longing swirled through her.Yes, she was leaving town with him.But if he knew what she really wanted, she was sure hed run far and fast.Angelas still pissed, Marc said.Yeah.I can tell.But shes coming to dinner, right?She said she was.Shes avoiding me, Kari said.Shell get over it.Daniel is avoiding me.Hell get over it, too.He may.Im not sure I will.Im sorry everythings such a mess right now, Kari said.Is there anything I can do to help?Marc took her hand.After a moment, he leaned in and gave her a gentle kiss.Angela may be watching, Kari said.She knows how I feel about you.For a split second, Kari imagined him saying it.I love you.
