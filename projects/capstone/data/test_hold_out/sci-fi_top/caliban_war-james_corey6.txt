The star stayed solid.Shouldnt it have gone dark like the others?Had he misjudged?Or was the creature looping around?If it could maneuver in raw vacuum, could it have noticed Alex bringing the reactor back online?Prax turned back toward the main airlock.The Rocinante had seemed like nothing a toothpick floating on an ocean of stars.Now the distance back to the airlock was immense.Prax moved one foot, then the other, trying to run without ever having both feet off the deck.The mag boots wouldnt let him release them both at the same time, the trailing foot trapped until the lead one signaled it was solid.His back itched, and he fought the urge to look behind.Nothing was there, and if something was, looking wouldnt help.The cable of his radio link turned from a line into a loop that trailed behind him as he moved.He pulled on it to take up the slack.The tiny green and yellow glow of the open airlock called to him like something from a dream.He heard himself whimpering a little, but the sound was lost in a string of profanity from Holden.Whats going on down there?Naomi snapped.Captains feeling a little under the weather, Amos said.Think he maybe wrenched something.My knee feels like someone gave birth in it, Holden said.Ill be fine.Are we clear for burn?Alex asked.We are not, Naomi said.Cargo doors are as closed as theyre going to get until we hit the docks, but the forward airlock isnt sealed.Im almost in, Prax said, thinking, Dont leave me here.Dont leave me in the pit with that thing.Right, then, Alex said.Let me know when I can get us the hell out of here.In the depth of the ship, Amos made a small sound.Prax reached the airlock, pulling himself in with a violence that made the joints of his suit creak.He yanked on his umbilical to pull it the rest of the way in after him.He flung himself against the far wall, slapping at the controls until the cycle started and the outer door slid closed.In the dim light of the airlock proper, Prax spun slowly on all three axes.The outer door remained closed.Nothing ripped it open; no glowing blue eyes appeared to crawl in after him.He bumped gently against the wall as the distant sound of an air pump announced the presence of atmosphere.Im in, he said.Im in the airlock.Is the captain stable?Naomi asked.Was he ever?Amos replied.Im fine.My knee hurts.Get us out of here.Amos?Naomi said.Im seeing youre still in the cargo bay.Is there a problem?Might be, Amos said.Our guy left something behind.Dont touch it!Holdens voice was harsh as a bark.Well get a torch and burn it down to its component atoms.Dont think thatd be a good idea, Amos said.Ive seen these before, and they dont take well to cutting torches.Prax levered himself up to standing, adjusting the slides on his boots to keep him lightly attached to the airlock floor.The inner airlock door chimed that it was safe to remove his suit and reenter the ship.He ignored it and activated one of the wall panels.He switched to a view of the cargo bay.Holden was floating near the cargo airlock.Amos was hanging on to a wall mounted ladder and examining something small and shiny stuck to the bulkhead.What is it, Amos?Naomi asked.Well, Id have to clean some of this yuck off it, Amos said.But it looks like a pretty standard incendiary charge.Not a big one, but enough to vaporize about two square meters.There was a moment of silence.Prax released the seal on his helmet, lifted it off, and took a deep breath of the ships air.He switched to an outside camera.The monster was drifting behind the ship, suddenly visible again in the faint light coming out of the cargo bay, and slowly receding from view.It was wrapped around his radioactive bait.A bomb, Holden said.Youre telling me that thing left a bomb?And pretty damn peculiar too.If you ask me, Amos replied.Amos, come with me into the cargo airlock, Holden said.Alex, whats left to do before we burn that monster up?Is Prax back inside?You guys in the lock?Alex said.We are now.Do it.Dont need to say it twice, Alex said.Brace for acceleration.The biochemical cascade that came from euphoria and panic and the reassurance of safety slowed Praxs response time so that when the burn began, he didnt quite have his legs under him.He stumbled against the wall, knocking his head against the inner door of the airlock.He didnt care.He felt wonderful.Hed gotten the monster off the ship.It was burning up in the Rocinantes fiery tail even as he watched.Then an angry god kicked the side of the ship and sent it spinning across the void.Prax was ripped from his feet, the gentle magnetic tug of his boots not enough to stop it.The outer airlock door rushed at him, and the world went black.Twenty Eight: Avasarala  There was another spike.A third one.Only this time, there didnt seem to be any chance of Bobbies monsters being involved.So maybe maybe it was coincidence.Which opened the question.If the thing hadnt come from Venus, then where?The world, however, had conspired to distract her.Shes not what we thought she was, maam, Soren said.I fell for the little lost Martian thing too.Shes good.Avasarala leaned back in her chair.The intelligence report on her screen showed the woman shed called Roberta Draper in civilian clothes.If anything, they made her look bigger.The name listed was Amanda Telele.Free operative of the Martian Intelligence Service.Im still looking into it, Soren said.It looks like there really was a Roberta Draper, but she died on Ganymede with the other marines.Avasarala waved the words away and scrolled through the report.Records of back channel steganographic messages between the alleged Bobbie and a known Martian operative on Luna beginning the day that Avasarala had recruited her.Avasarala waited for the fear to squeeze her chest, the sense of betrayal.They didnt come.She kept turning to new parts of the report, taking in new information and waiting for her body to react.It kept not happening.We looked into this why?she asked.It was a hunch, Soren said.It was just the way she carried herself when she wasnt around you.She was a little too slick, I guess.She just didnt seem right.So I took the initiative.I said it was from you.So that I wouldnt look like such a fucking idiot for inviting a mole into my office?Seemed like the polite thing to do, Soren said.If youre looking for ways to reward my good service, I do accept bonuses and promotion.I fucking bet you do, Avasarala said.He waited, leaning a little forward on his toes.Waiting for her to give the order to have Bobbie arrested and submitted for a full intelligence debriefing.As euphemisms went, full intelligence debriefing was among the most obscene, but they were at war with Mars, and a high value intelligence agent planted in the heart of the UN would know things that were invaluable.So, Avasarala thought, why am I not reacting to this?She reached out to the screen, paused, pulled back her hand, frowning.Maam?Soren said.It was the smallest thing, and the least expected.Soren bit at the inside of his bottom lip.It was a tiny movement, almost invisible.Like a tell at a poker table.And as she saw it, Avasarala knew.There was no thinking it out, no reasoning, no struggle or second guessing.It was all simply there, clear in her mind as if she had always known it, complete and perfect.Soren was nervous because the report she was looking at wouldnt hold up to rigorous scrutiny.It wouldnt hold up because it was a fake.It was a fake because Soren was working for someone else, someone who wanted to control the information getting to Avasaralas desk.Nguyen had re created his little fleet without her knowing it because Soren was the one watching the data traffic.Someone had known that she would need controlling.Handling.This was something that had been prepared for since well before Ganymede had gone pear shaped.The monster on Ganymede had been anticipated.And so it was Errinwright.He had let her demand her peace negotiations, let her think shed undermined Nguyen, let her take Bobbie onto her staff.All of it, so that she wouldnt get suspicious.This wasnt a shard of Venus that had escaped; it was a military project.A weapon that Earth wanted in order to break its rivals before the alien project on Venus finished whatever it was doing.Someone probably Mao Kwikowski had retained a sample of the protomolecule in some separate and firewalled lab, weaponized it, and opened bidding.The attack on Ganymede had been on one hand a proof of concept assault, on the other a crippling blow to the outer planets food supply.The OPA had never been on the list of bidders.And then Nguyen had gone to the Jovian system to collect the goods, James Holden and his pet botanist had walked in on some part of it, and Mars had figured out they were about to lose the trade.Avasarala wondered how much Errinwright had given Jules Pierre Mao to outbid Mars.It would have had to be more than just money.Earth was about to get its first protomolecule weapon, and Errinwright had kept her out of the loop because whatever he was going to do with it, she wasnt going to like it.And she was one of the only people in the solar system who might have been able to stop him.She wondered whether she still was.Thank you, Soren, she said.I appreciate this.Do we know where she is?Shes looking for you, Soren said, and a sly smile tugged at his lips.She may be under the impression that youre asleep.It is pretty late.Sleep?Yes, I remember that vaguely, Avasarala said.All right.Im going to need to talk to Errinwright.Do you want me to have her arrested?No, I dont.The disappointment barely showed.How should we move forward?Soren asked.Ill talk to Errinwright, she said.Can you get me some tea?Yes, maam, he said, and practically bowed his way out of the room.Avasarala leaned back in her chair.Her mind felt calm.Her body was centered and still, like shed ended a particularly long and effective meditation.She pulled up the connection request and waited to see how long Errinwright or his assistant would take to respond.As soon as she made the request, it was flagged PRIORITY PENDING.Three minutes later, Errinwright was there.He spoke from his hand terminal, the picture jumping as the car he was in bumped and turned.It was full night wherever he was.Chrisjen!he said.Is anything wrong?Nothing in particular, Avasarala said, silently cursing the connection.She wanted to see his face.She wanted to watch him lie to her.Sorens brought me something interesting.Intelligence thinks my Martian liaisons a spy.Really?Errinwright said.Thats unfortunate.Are you arresting her?I dont think so, Avasarala said.I think Ill put my own flag on her traffic.Better the devil we know.Dont you agree?The pause was hardly noticeable.Thats a good idea.Do that.Thank you, sir.Since Ive got you here, I needed to ask you something.Do you have anything that requires you in the office, or can you work on a ship?She smiled.Here was the next move, then.What are you thinking about?Errinwrights car reached a stretch of smoother pavement and his face came into clearer focus.He was wearing a dark suit with a high collared shirt and no tie.He looked like a priest.Ganymede.We need to show that were taking the situation out there seriously.The secretary general wants someone senior to go there physically.Report back on the humanitarian angle.Since youre the one whos taken point on this, he thought youd be the right face to put on it.And I thought it would give you the chance to follow up on the initial attack too.Were in a shooting war, Avasarala said.I dont think the Navy would want to spare a ship to haul my old bones out there.Besides which, Im coordinating the investigation into Venus, arent I?Blank check and all.Errinwright grinned exactly as if hed meant it.Ive got you taken care of.Jules Pierre Mao is taking a yacht from Luna to Ganymede to oversee his companys humanitarian aid efforts.Hes offered a berth.Its better accommodations than you get at the office.Probably better bandwidth too.You can monitor Venus from there.Mao Kwik is part of the government now?I hadnt known, she said.Were all on the same side.Mao Kwik is as interested as anyone in seeing those people cared for.Avasaralas door opened and Roberta Draper loomed into the office.She looked like crap.Her skin had the ashy look of that of someone who hadnt slept in too long.Her jaw was set.Avasarala nodded toward the chair.I take up a lot of bandwidth, she said.Wont be a problem.Youll get first priority on all communications channels.The Martian sat down across the desk, well out of the cameras cone.Bobbie braced her hands on her thighs, elbows to the sides, like a wrestler getting ready to step into the cage.Avasarala made herself not glance at the woman.Can I think about it?Chrisjen, Errinwright said, bringing his hand terminal closer in, his wide, round face filling the screen.I told the secretary general that this might not fly.Even in the best yacht, traveling out to the Jovian system is a hard journey.If youve got too much to do or if youre at all uncomfortable with the trip, you just say so and Ill find someone else.They just wont be as good as you.Who is?Avasarala said with a toss of her hand.Rage was boiling in her gut.Fine.Youve talked me into it.When do I leave?The yachts scheduled for departure in four days.Im sorry for the tight turnaround, but I didnt have confirmation until about an hour ago.Serendipity.If I were a religious man, Id say it meant something.Ill have the details sent to Soren.Better send it to me directly, Avasarala said.Sorens going to have a lot on his plate already.Whatever you like, he said.Her boss had secretly started a war.He was working with the same corporations that had let the genie out of the bottle on Phoebe, sacrificed Eros, and threatened everything human.He was a frightened little boy in a good suit picking a fight he thought he could win because he was pissing himself over the real threat.She smiled at him.Good men and women had already died because of him and Nguyen.Children had died on Ganymede.Belters would be scrambling for calories.Some would starve.Errinwrights round cheeks fell a millimeter.His brows knotted just a bit.He knew that she knew.Because of course he did.Players at their level didnt deceive each other.They won even though their opponents knew exactly what was happening.Just like he was winning against her right now.Are you feeling all right?he asked.I think this is the first conversation weve had in ten years where you havent said something vulgar.Avasarala grinned at the screen, reaching out her fingertips as if she could caress him.Cunt, she said carefully.When the connection dropped, she put her head in her hands for a moment, blowing out her breath and sucking it back in hard, focusing.When she sat up, Bobbie was watching her.Evening, Avasarala said.Ive been trying to find you, Bobbie said.My connections were blocked.Avasarala grunted.We need to talk about something.Someone.I mean, Soren, Bobbie said.You remember that data you wanted him to take care of a couple days ago?He handed it off to someone else.I dont know who, but they were military.Ill swear to that.So thats what spooked him, Avasarala thought.Caught with his hands in the cookie jar.Poor idiot had underestimated her pet Marine.All right, she said.I understand that you dont have any reason to trust me, Bobbie said, but Okay.Why are you laughing?Avasarala stood up, stretching until the joints in her shoulders ached pleasantly.At this moment, you are literally the only one on my staff who I trust as far as I can piss.You remember when I said that the thing on Ganymede wasnt us?It wasnt then but it is now.Weve bought it, and I assume were planning to use it against you.Bobbie stood up.Her face, once just ashen, was bloodless.I have to tell my superiors, she said, her voice thick and strangled.No, you dont.They know.And you cant prove it yet any more than I can.Tell them now and theyll broadcast it, and well deny it and blah blah blah.The bigger problem is that youre coming back to Ganymede with me.Im being sent.She explained everything.Sorens false intelligence report, what it implied, Errinwrights betrayal, and the mission to Ganymede on the Mao Kwik yacht.You cant do that, Bobbie said.Its a pain in the ass, Avasarala agreed.Theyll be monitoring my connections, but theyre probably doing the same here.And if theyre shipping me to Ganymede, you can be dead sure that nothing is going to happen there.Theyre putting me in a box until its too late to change anything.Or thats what theyre trying, anyway.Im not giving away the fucking game yet.You cant get on that ship, Bobbie said.Its a trap.Of course its a trap, Avasarala said, waving a hand.But its a trap I have to step into.Refuse a request from the secretary general?That comes out, and everyone starts thinking Im about to retire.No one backs a player whos going to be powerless next year.We play for the long term, and that means looking strong for the duration.Errinwright knows that.Its why he played it this way.Outside, another shuttle was lifting off.Avasarala could already hear the roar of the burn, feel the press of thrust and false gravity pushing her back.It had been thirty years since shed been out of Earths gravity well.This wasnt going to be pleasant.If you get on that ship, theyll kill you, Bobbie said, making each word its own sentence.Thats not how this game gets played, Avasarala said.What they   The door opened again.Soren had a tray in his hands.The teapot on it was cast iron, with a single handleless enamel cup.He opened his mouth to speak, then saw Bobbie.It was easy to forget how much larger she was until a man Sorens height visibly cowered before her.My tea!Thats excellent.Do you want any, Bobbie?No.All right.Well, put it down, Soren.Im not drinking it with you standing there.Good.And pour me a cup.Avasarala watched him turn his back on the marine.His hands didnt shake; shed give the boy that much.Avasarala stood silent, waiting for him to bring it to her as if he were a puppy learning to retrieve a toy.When he did, she blew across the surface of the tea, scattering the thin veil of steam.He carefully didnt turn to look at Bobbie.Will there be anything else, maam?Avasarala smiled.How many people had this boy killed just by lying to her?She would never know for certain, and neither would he.The best she could do was not another.Soren, she said.Theyre going to know it was you.It was too much.He looked over his shoulder.Then he looked back, greenish with anxiety.Who do you mean?he said, trying for charm.Them.If youre counting on them to help your career, I just want you to understand that they wont.The kind of men youre working for?Once they know youve slipped, youre nothing to them.They have no tolerance for failure.I   Neither do I.  Dont leave anything personal at your desk.She watched it in his eyes.The future hed planned and worked for, defined himself by, fell away.A life on basic support rose in its place.It wasnt enough.It wasnt nearly enough.But it was all the justice she could manage on short notice.When the door was closed, Bobbie cleared her throat.Whats going to happen to him?she asked.Avasarala sipped her tea.It was good, fresh green tea, brewed perfectly rich and sweet and not even slightly bitter.Who gives a shit?she said.The Mao Kwik yacht leaves in four days.Thats not much time.And neither of us is going to be able to take a dump without the bad guys knowing.Im going to get you a list of people I need to have drinks or lunch or coffee with before we leave.Your job is to arrange it so I do.Im your social secretary now?Bobbie said, bristling.You and my husband are the only two people alive who I know arent trying to stop me, Avasarala said.Thats how far down I am right now.This has to happen, and there is no one else I can rely on.So yes.Youre my social secretary.Youre my bodyguard.Youre my psychiatrist.All of it.You.Bobbie lowered her head, breathing out through flared nostrils.Her lips pursed and she shook her massive head once quickly left, then right, then back to center.Youre fucked, she said.Avasarala took another sip of her tea.She should have been ruined.She should have been in tears.Shed been cut off from her own power, tricked.Jules Pierre Mao had sat there, not a meter from where she was now, and laughed down his sleeve at her.Errinwright and Nguyen and whoever else was in his little cabal.Theyd tricked her.Shed sat there, pulling strings and trading favors and thinking that she was doing something real.For months maybe years  she hadnt noticed that she was being closed out.Theyd made a fool of her.She should have been humiliated.Instead, she felt alive.This was her game, and if she was behind at halftime, it only meant they expected her to lose.There was nothing better than being underestimated.Do you have a gun?Bobbie almost laughed.They dont like having Martian soldiers walking around the United Nations with guns.I have to eat lunch with a dull spork.Were at war.All right, fine.When we get on the yacht, youre in charge of security.Youre going to need a gun.Ill arrange that for you.You can?Honestly, though, Id rather have my suit.Your suit?What suit?I had custom fit powered armor with me when I came here.The video feed of the monster was copied from it.They said they were turning it over to your guys to confirm the original footage hadnt been faked.Avasarala looked at Bobbie and sipped her tea.Michael Jon would know where it was.Shed call him the next morning, arrange to have it brought on board the Mao Kwik yacht with an innocuous label like WARDROBE stamped on the side.Probably thinking she needed to be convinced, Bobbie kept talking.Seriously.Get me a gun, Im a soldier.Get that suit for me, Im a superhero.If weve still got it, youll have it.All right, then, Bobbie said.She smiled.For the first time since theyd met, Avasarala was afraid of her.God help whoever makes you put it on.Twenty Nine: Holden  Gravity returned as Alex brought the engine up, and Holden floated down to the deck of the cargo bay airlock at a gentle half g.  They didnt need to go fast now that the monster was outside the ship.They just needed to put some distance between the ship and it, and get it into the drives star hot exhaust plume, where it would be broken down into its various subatomic particles.Even the protomolecule couldnt survive being reduced to ions.He hoped, anyway.When he touched down on the deck, he intended to turn on the wall monitor and check the aft cameras.He wanted to watch the thing be torched, but the moment his weight came down, a white hot spike of pain took his knee.He yelped and collapsed.Amos drifted down next to him, then kicked off his boot mags and started to kneel.You okay, Cap?he said.Fine.I mean, for I think I blew out my knee levels of fine.Yeah.Joint injurys a lot less painful in microgravity, aint it?Holden was about to reply when a massive hammer hit the side of the ship.The hull rang like a gong.The Rocis engine cut off almost instantly, and the ship snapped into a flat spin.Amos was lifted away from Holden and thrown across the airlock to slam against the outer door.Holden slid along the deck to land standing upright against the bulkhead next to him, his knee collapsing under him so painfully he nearly blacked out.He chinned a button in his helmet, and his body armor shot him full of amphetamines and painkillers.Within seconds, his knee still hurt, but the pain was very far away and easy to ignore.The threatening tunnel vision vanished and the airlock became very bright.His heart started to race.Alex, he said, knowing the answer before he asked, what was that?When we torched our passenger there, the bomb in the cargo bay went off, the pilot replied.Weve got serious damage to that bay, to the outer hull, and to engineering.Reactor went into emergency shutdown.The cargo bay turned into a second drive during the blast and put us into a spin.I have no control over the ship.Amos groaned and began moving his limbs.That sucks.We need to kill this spin, Holden said.What do you need to get the attitude thrusters back up?Holden, Naomi cut in, I think Prax may be injured in the airlock.Hes not moving in there.Is he dying?The hesitation lasted for one very long second.His suit doesnt think so.Then ship first, Holden said.First aid after.Alex, weve got radios again.And the lights are on.So the jamming is gone, and the batteries must still be working.Why cant you fire the thrusters?Looks like primary and secondary pumps are out.No water pressure.Confirmed, Naomi said a second later.Primary wasnt in the blast area.If its toast, engineering must be a mess.Secondarys on the deck above.It shouldnt have been physically damaged, but there was a big power spike just before the reactor went off line.Might have fried it or blown a breaker.Okay, were on it.Amos, Holden said, pulling himself over to where the mechanic lay on the cargo airlocks outer door.You with me?Amos gave a one handed Belter nod, then groaned.Just knocked the wind out of me, is all.Gotta get up, big man, Holden said, pushing himself to his feet.In the partial gravity of their spin, his leg felt heavy, hot, and stiff as a board.Without the drugs pouring through him, standing on it would have probably made him scream.Instead, he pulled Amos up, putting even more pressure on it.I will pay for this later, he thought.But the amphetamines made later seem very far away.What?Amos said, slurring the word.He probably had a concussion, but Holden would get him some medical attention later when the ship was back under their control.We need to get to the secondary water pump, Holden said, forcing himself to speak slowly in spite of the drugs.Whats the fastest access point?Machine shop, Amos replied, then closed his eyes and seemed to fall asleep on his feet.Naomi, Holden said.Can you control Amos suit from there?Yes.Shoot him full of speed.I cant drag his ass around with me, and I need him.Okay, she said.A couple of seconds later, Amos eyes popped open.Shit, he said.Was I asleep?His words were still slurred but now had a sort of manic energy to them.We need to get to the bulkhead access point in the machine shop.Grab whatever you think well need to get the pump running.It might have blown a breaker or fried some wiring.Ill meet you there.Okay, Amos said, then pulled himself along the toe rings set into the floor to get to the inner airlock door.A moment later it was open and he crawled out of view.With the ship spinning, gravity was pulling Holden to a point halfway between the deck and the starboard bulkhead.None of the ladders and rings set into the ship for use in low g or under thrust would be oriented in the right direction.Not really a problem with four working limbs, but it would make maneuvering with one useless leg difficult.And of course, once he moved past wherever the ships center of spin was, everything would reverse.For a moment, his perspective shifted.The vicious Coriolis rattled the fine bones inside his ears, and he was riding a spinning hunk of metal lost in permanent free fall.Then he was under it, about to be crushed.He flushed with the sweat that came a moment before nausea as his brain ran through scenarios to explain the sensations of the spin.He chinned the suit controls, pumping a massive dose of emergency antinausea drugs into his bloodstream.Without giving himself more time to think about it, Holden grabbed the toe rings and pulled himself up to the inner airlock door.He could see Amos filling a plastic bucket with tools and supplies he was yanking out of drawers and lockers.Naomi, Holden said.Going to take a peek in engineering.Do we have any cameras left in there?She made a sort of disgusted grunt he interpreted as a negative, then said, Ive got systems shorted out all over the ship.Either theyre destroyed, or the power is out on that circuit.Holden pulled himself over to the deck mounted pressure hatch that separated the machine shop from engineering.A status light on the hatch blinked an angry red.Shit, I was afraid of that.What?Naomi asked.You dont have environmental readings either, do you?Not from engineering.Thats all down.Well, Holden said with a long sigh.The hatch thinks theres no atmosphere on the other side.That incendiary charge actually blew a hole through the bulkhead, and engineering is in vacuum.Uh oh, Alex said.Cargo bays in vacuum too.And the cargo bay door is broken, Naomi added.And the cargo airlock.And a partridge in a fucking pear tree, Amos said with a disgusted snort.Lets get the damn ship to stop spinning and Ill go outside and take a look at it.Amos is right, Holden said, giving up on the hatch and pushing himself to his feet.He staggered down a steeply angled bulkhead to the access panel where Amos was now waiting, bucket in hand.First things first.While Amos used a torque wrench to unbolt the access panel, Holden said, Actually, Naomi, pump all the air out of the machine shop too.No atmo below deck four.Override the safeties so we can open the engineering hatch if we need to.Amos ran out the last bolt and pulled the panel off the bulkhead.Beyond it lay a dark, cramped space filled with a confusing tangle of pipes and cabling.Oh, Holden added.Might want to prep an SOS if we cant get this fixed.Yeah, because we got a lot of people out there who we really want coming to help us right now, Amos said.Amos pulled himself into the narrow passage between the two hulls and then out of sight.Holden followed him in.Two meters beyond the hatch loomed the blocky and complex looking pump mechanism that kept water pressure to the maneuvering thrusters.Amos stopped next to it and began pulling parts off.Holden waited behind him, the narrow space not allowing him to see what the big mechanic was doing.Hows it look?Holden asked after a few minutes of listening to Amos curse under his breath while he worked.It looks fine here, Amos said.Gonna swap this breaker anyway, just to be sure.But I dont think the pumps our problem.Shit.Holden backed out of the maintenance hatch and half crawled up the steep slope of bulkhead back to the engineering hatch.The angry red light had been replaced with a morose yellow one now that there was no atmosphere on either side of the hatch.Naomi, Holden said.Ive got to get into engineering.I need to see what happened in there.Have you killed the safeties?Yes.But Ive got no sensors in there.The room could be flooded with radiation   But you have sensors here in the machine shop, right?If I open the hatch and you get radiation warnings, just let me know.Ill shut it immediately.Jim, Naomi said, the stiffness that had been in her voice every time shed spoken to him for the last day slipping a bit.How many times can you get yourself massively irradiated before it catches up with you?At least once more?Ill tell the Roci to prep a bed in sick bay, she said, not quite laughing.Get one of the ones thats not throwing errors.Without giving himself time to rethink it, Holden slapped the release on the deck hatch.He held his breath while it opened, expecting to see chaos and destruction on the other side, followed by his suits radiation alarm.Instead, other than one small hole in the bulkhead closest to the explosion, it looked fine.Holden pulled himself through the opening and hung by his arms for a few moments, examining the space.The massive fusion reactor that dominated the center of the compartment looked untouched.The bulkhead on the starboard side bowed in precariously, with a charred hole in its center, like a miniature volcano had formed there.Holden shuddered at the thought of how much energy had to have been released to bend the heavily armored and radiation shielded bulkhead in like that, and how close it had come to punching a hole in their reactor.How many more joules to go from a badly dented wall to full containment breach?God, this one was close, he said out loud to no one in particular.Swapped out all the parts I can think to, Amos said.The problem is somewhere else.Holden let go of the rim of the hatch and dropped a half meter to the bulkhead, which angled below him, then slid to the deck.The only other visible damage was a hunk of bulkhead plating stuck in the wall exactly on the other side of the reactor.Holden couldnt see any way that the shrapnel could have gotten there without passing directly through the reactor, or else bouncing off two bulkheads and around it.There was no sign of the first, so the second, incredibly unlikely though it was, had to be what had happened.I mean, really close, he said, touching the jagged metal fragment.It was sunk a good fifteen centimeters into the wall.Plenty far enough to have at least breached the shielding on the reactor.Maybe worse.Grabbing your camera, Naomi said.A moment later she whistled.No kidding.The walls in there are mostly cabling.Cant make a hole like that without breaking something.Holden tried to pull the shrapnel out of the wall by hand and failed.Amos, bring some pliers and a lot of patch cabling.So no on the distress call, then, Naomi said.No.But if someone could point a camera aft and reassure me that for all this trouble we actually killed that damned thing, that would be just swell.Watched it go myself, Cap, Alex said.Nothin but gas now.Holden lay on one of the sick bay beds, letting the ship look his leg over.Periodically a manipulator prodded his knee, which was swelled up to the size of a cantaloupe, the skin stretched tight as a drums head.But the bed was also making sure to keep him perfectly medicated, so the occasional pokes and prods registered only as pressure without any pain.The panel next to his head warned him to remain still; then two arms grabbed his leg while a third injected a needle thin flexible tube into his knee and started doing something arthroscopic.He felt a vague tugging sensation.At the next bed over lay Prax.His head was bandaged where a three centimeter flap of skin had been glued back down.His eyes were closed.Amos, who had turned out not to have a concussion, just another nasty bump on his head, was belowdecks doing makeshift repairs on everything the monsters bomb had broken, including putting a temporary patch on the hole in their engineering bulkhead.They wouldnt be able to fix the cargo bay door until they docked at Tycho.Alex was flying them there at a gentle quarter g to make it easier to work.Holden didnt mind the delay.The truth was he was in no hurry to get back to Tycho and confront Fred about what hed seen.The longer he thought about it, the further he got from his earlier blind panic, and the more he thought Naomi was right.It made no sense for Fred to be behind any of this.But he wasnt sure.And he had to be sure.Prax mumbled something and touched his head.He started pulling on the bandages.I wouldnt mess with those, Holden said.Prax nodded and closed his eyes again.Sleeping, or trying to.The auto doc pulled the tube out of Holdens leg, sprayed it with antiseptic, and began wrapping it with a tight bandage.Holden waited until the medical pod was done doing whatever it was doing to his knee, then turned sideways on the bed and tried to stand up.Even at a quarter g, his leg wouldnt support him.He hopped on one foot over to a supply locker and got himself a crutch.As he moved past the botanists bed, Prax grabbed his arm.His grip was surprisingly strong.Its dead?Yeah, Holden said, patting his hand.We got it.Thanks.Prax didnt reply; he just rolled onto his side and shook.It took Holden a moment to realize Prax was weeping.He left without saying anything else.What else was there to say?Holden took the ladder lift up, planning to go to ops and read the detailed damage reports Naomi and the Roci were compiling.He stopped when he got to the personnel deck and heard two people speaking.He couldnt hear what they were saying, but he recognized Naomis voice, and he recognized the tone she used when she was having an intimate conversation.The voices were coming from the galley.Feeling a little like a Peeping Tom, Holden moved closer to the galley hatch until he could make out the words.Its more than that, Naomi was saying.Holden almost walked into the galley, but something in her tone stopped him.He had the terrible feeling she was talking about him.About them.About why she was leaving.Why does it have to be more?the other person said.Amos.You almost beat a man to death with a can of chicken on Ganymede, Naomi replied.Gonna hold a little girl hostage for some food?Fuck him.If he was here, Id smash him again right now.Do you trust me, Amos?Naomi said.Her voice was sad.More than that.Frightened.More than anyone else, Amos replied.Im scared out of my wits.Jim is rushing off to do something really dumb on Tycho.This guy were taking with us seems like hes one twitch from a nervous breakdown.Well, hes   And you, she continued.I depend on you.I know youve always got my back, no matter what.Except maybe not now, because the Amos I know doesnt beat a skinny kid half to death, no matter how much chicken he asks for.I feel like everyones losing themselves.I need to understand, because Im really, really frightened.Holden felt the urge to go in, take her hand, hold her.The need in her voice demanded it, but he held himself back.There was a long pause.Holden heard a scraping sound, followed by the sound of metal hitting glass.Someone was stirring sugar into coffee.The sounds were so clear he could almost see it.So, Baltimore, Amos said, his voice as relaxed as if he were going to talk about the weather.Not a nice town.You ever heard of squeezing?Squeeze trade?Hooker squeeze?No.Is it a drug?No, Amos said with a laugh.No, when you squeeze a hooker, you put her on the street until she gets knocked up, then peddle her to johns who get off on pregnant girls, then send her back to the streets after she pops the kid.With procreation restrictions, banging pregnant girls is quite the kink.Squeeze?Yeah, you know, squeezing out puppies?You never heard it called that?Okay, Naomi said, trying to hide her disgust.Those kids?Theyre illegal, but they dont just vanish, not right away, Amos continued.They got uses too.Holden felt his chest tighten a little.It wasnt something hed ever thought about.When, a second later, Naomi spoke, her horror echoed his.Jesus.Jesus got nothing to do with it, Amos said.No Jesus in the squeeze trade.But some kids wind up in the pimp gangs.Some wind up on the streets  Some wind up finding a way to ship offworld, and they never go back?Naomi asked, her voice quiet.Maybe, Amos said, his voice as flat and conversational as ever.Maybe some do.But most of them just disappear, eventually.Used up.Most of them.For a time, no one spoke.Holden heard the sounds of coffee being drunk.Amos, she said, her voice thick.I never   So Id like to find this little girl before someone uses her up, and she disappears.Id like to do that for her, Amos said.His voice caught for a moment, and he cleared it with a loud cough.For her dad.Holden thought they were done, and started to slip away when he heard Amos, his voice calm again, say, Then Im going to kill whoever snatched her.Thirty: Bobbie  Prior to working for Avasarala at the UN, Bobbie had never even heard of Mao Kwikowski Mercantile, or if she had, she hadnt noticed.Shed spent her whole life wearing, eating, or sitting on products carted through the solar system by Mao Kwik freighters without ever realizing it.After shed gone through the files Avasarala had given her, shed been astonished at the size and reach of the company.Hundreds of ships, dozens of stations, millions of employees.Jules Pierre Mao owned significant properties on every habitable planet and moon in the solar system.His eighteen year old daughter had owned her own racing ship.And that was the daughter he didnt like.When Bobbie tried to imagine being so wealthy you could own a spaceship just to compete in races, she failed.That the same girl had run away to be an OPA rebel probably said a lot about the relationship of wealth and contentment, but Bobbie had a hard time being that philosophical.Shed grown up solidly Martian middle class.Her father had done twenty as a Marine noncom and had gone into private security consulting after hed left the corps.Bobbies family had always had a nice home.She and her two older brothers had attended a private primary school, and her brothers had both gone on to university without having to take out student loans.Growing up, shed never once thought of herself as poor.She did now.Owning your own racing ship wasnt even wealth.It was like speciation.It was conspicuous consumption befitting ancient Earth royalty, a pharaohs pyramid with a reaction drive.Bobbie had thought it was the most ridiculous excess shed ever heard of.And then she climbed off the short flight shuttle onto Jules Pierre Maos private L5 station.Jules didnt park his ships in orbit at a public station.He didnt even use a Mao Kwik corporate station.This was an entire fully functioning space station in orbit around Earth solely for his private spaceships, and the whole thing done up like peacock feathers.It was a level of extravagance that had never even occurred to her.She also thought it made Mao himself very dangerous.Everything he did was an announcement of his freedom from constraint.He was a man without boundaries.Killing a senior politician of the UN government might be bad business.It might wind up being expensive.But it would never actually be risky to a man with this much wealth and power.Avasarala didnt see it.I hate spin gravity, Avasarala said, sipping at a cup of steaming tea.Theyd be on the station for only three hours, while cargo was transferred from the shuttle to Maos yacht, but theyd been assigned a suite of four full sized bedrooms, each with its own shower, and a massive lounge area.A huge screen pretended to be a window, the crescent Earth with her continent veiling clouds hung on the black.They had a private kitchen staffed by three people, whose biggest task so far had been making the assistant undersecretarys tea.Bobbie considered ordering a large meal just to give them something to do.I cant believe were about to climb on a ship owned by this man.Have you ever known anyone this wealthy to go to jail?Or even be prosecuted?This guy could probably walk in here and shoot you in the face on a live newsfeed and get away with it.Avasarala laughed at her.Bobbie suppressed a surge of anger.It was just fear looking for an outlet.Thats not the game, Avasarala said.No one gets shot.They get marginalized.Its worse.No, its not.Ive seen people shot.Ive seen my friends shot.When you say, Thats not the game, you mean for people like you.Not like me.Avasaralas expression cooled.Yes, thats what I mean, the old woman said.The level were playing at has different rules.Its like playing go.Its all about exerting influence.Controlling the board without occupying it.Poker is a game too, Bobbie said.But sometimes the stakes get so high that one player decides its easier to kill the other guy and walk away with the money.It happens all the time.Avasarala nodded at her, not replying right away, visibly thinking over what Bobbie had said.Bobbie felt her anger replaced with a sudden rush of affection for the grumpy and arrogant old lady.Okay, Avasarala said, putting her teacup down and placing her hands in her lap.I hear what youre saying, Sergeant.I think its unlikely, but Im glad youre here to say it.But you arent taking it seriously, Bobbie wanted to shout at her.Instead, she asked the servant who hovered nearby for a mushroom and onion sandwich.While she ate it, Avasarala sipped tea, nibbled on a cookie, and made small talk about the war and her grandchildren.Bobbie tried to be sure to make concerned noises during the war parts and awww, cute noises when the kids were the topic.But all she could think about was the tactical nightmare defending Avasarala on an enemy controlled spacecraft would be.Her recon suit was in a large crate marked FORMAL WEAR and being loaded onto the Mao yacht even as they waited.Bobbie wanted to sneak off and put it on.She didnt notice when Avasarala stopped speaking for several minutes.Bobbie, Avasarala said, her face not quite a frown.Are my stories about my beloved grandchildren boring you?Yeah, Bobbie replied.They really are.Bobbie had thought that Mao Station was the most ludicrous display of conspicuous wealth shed ever seen right up until they boarded the yacht.While the station was extravagant, it at least served a function.It was Jules Maos personal orbital garage, where he could store and service his fleet of private spacecraft.Underneath the glitz there was a working station, with mechanics and support staff doing actual jobs.The yacht, the Guanshiyin, was the size of a standard cheapjack people mover that would have transported two hundred customers, but it only had a dozen staterooms.Its cargo area was just large enough to contain the supplies theyd need for a lengthy voyage.It wasnt particularly fast.It was, by any reasonable measurement, a miserable failure as a useful spacecraft.But its job was not to be useful.The Guanshiyins job was to be comfortable.Extravagantly comfortable.It was like a hotel lobby.The carpet was plush and soft underfoot, and actual crystal chandeliers caught the light.Everyplace that should have had a sharp corner was rounded.Softened.The walls were papered with raw bamboo and natural fiber.The first thing Bobbie thought was how hard it would be to clean, and the second thing was that the difficulty was intentional.Each suite of rooms took up nearly an entire deck of the ship.Each room had its own private bath, media center, game room, and lounge with a full bar.The lounge had a gigantic screen showing the view outside, which would not have been higher definition had it been an actual glass window.Near the bar was a dumbwaiter next to an intercom, which could deliver food prepared by Cordon Bleu chefs any hour of the day or night.The carpet was so thick Bobbie was pretty sure mag boots wouldnt work.It wouldnt matter.A ship like this would never break down, never have to stop the engines during flight.The kind of people who flew on the Guanshiyin had probably never actually worn an environment suit in their lives.All the fixtures in her bathroom were gold plated.Bobbie and Avasarala were sitting in the lounge with the head of her UN security team, a pleasant looking gray haired man of Kurdish descent named Cotyar.Bobbie had been worried when she first met him.He looked like a friendly high school teacher, not a soldier.But then shed watched him go through Avasaralas rooms with practiced efficiency, laying out their security plan and directing his team, and her worries eased.Well, impressions?Avasarala asked, leaning back in a plush armchair with her eyes closed.This room is not secure, Cotyar said, his accent exotic to Bobbies ears.We should not discuss sensitive matters here.Your private room has been secured for such discussions.This is a trap, Bobbie said.Arent we finished with that shit yet?Avasarala said, then leaned forward to give Bobbie a glare.She is right, Cotyar said quietly, clearly unhappy to be discussing such matters in an unsecured room.Ive counted fourteen crew on this ship already, and I would estimate that is less than one third of the total crew of this vessel.I have a team of six for your protection   Seven, Bobbie interrupted, raising her hand.As you say, Cotyar continued with a nod.Seven.We do not control any of the ships systems.Assassination would be as simple as sealing the deck we are on and pumping out the air.Bobbie pointed at Cotyar and said, See?Avasarala waved a hand as if she were shooing flies.Whats communications look like?Robust, Cotyar said.Weve set up a private network and have been given the backup tightbeam and radio array for your personal use.Bandwidth is significant, though light delay will be an increasing factor as we move away from Earth.Good, Avasarala said, smiling for the first time since theyd come on the ship.Shed stopped looking tired a while ago and had moved on to whatever tired turns into when it became a lifestyle.None of this is secure, Cotyar said.We can secure our private internal network, but if they are monitoring outbound and inbound traffic through the array were using, there will be no way to detect that.We have no access to ship operations.And, Avasarala said, that is exactly why Im here.Bottle me up, send me on a long trip, and read all my fucking mail.Were lucky if thats all they do, Bobbie said.Thinking about how tired Avasarala looked had reminded her how tired she was too.She felt herself drift away for a moment.Avasarala finished saying something, and Cotyar nodded and said yes to her.She turned to Bobbie and said, Do you agree?Uh, Bobbie said, trying to rewind the conversation in her head and failing.Im   Youre practically falling out of your fucking chair.Whens the last time you got a full nights sleep?Probably about the last time you did, Bobbie said.The last time all my squaddies were alive, and you werent trying to keep the solar system from catching on fire.She waited for the next scathing comment, the next observation that she couldnt do her job if she was that compromised.That weak.Fair enough, Avasarala said.Bobbie felt another little surge of affection for her.Maos throwing a big dinner tonight to welcome us aboard.I want you and Cotyar to come with.Cotyar will be security, so hell stand at the back of the room and look menacing.Bobbie laughed before she could stop herself.Cotyar smiled and winked at her.And, Avasarala continued, youll be there as my social secretary, so you can chat people up.Try to get a feel for the crew and the mood of the ship.Okay?Roger that.I noticed, Avasarala said, her tone shifting to the one she used when she was going to ask for an unpleasant favor, the executive officer staring at you when we did the airlock meet and greet.Bobbie nodded.Shed noticed it too.Some men had a large woman fetish, and Bobbie had gotten the hair raising sense that he might be a member of that tribe.They tended to have unresolved mommy issues, so she generally steered clear.Any chance you could talk him up at dinner?Avasarala finished.Bobbie laughed, expecting everyone else to laugh too.Even Cotyar was looking at her as though Avasarala had made a perfectly reasonable request.Uh, no, Bobbie said.Did you say no?Yeah, no.Hell no.Fuck no.Nein und abermals nein.Nyet.La.Siei, Bobbie said, stopping when she ran out of languages.And Im actually a little pissed now.Im not asking you to sleep with him.Good, because I dont use sex as a weapon, Bobbie said.I use weapons as weapons.Chrisjen!Jules Mao said, enveloping Avasaralas hand in his and shaking it.The lord of the Mao Kwik empire towered over Avasarala.He had the kind of handsome face that made Bobbie instinctively want to like him, and medically untreated male pattern hair loss that said he didnt care whether she did.Choosing not to use his wealth to fix a problem as treatable as thinning hair actually made him seem even more in control.He wore a loose sweater and cotton pants that hung on him like a tailored suit.When Avasarala introduced Bobbie to him, he smiled and nodded while barely glancing in her direction.Is your staff settled in?he asked, letting Avasarala know that Bobbies presence reminded him of underlings.Bobbie gritted her teeth but kept her face blank.Yes, Avasarala replied with what Bobbie would have sworn was genuine warmth.The accommodations are lovely, and your crew has been wonderful.Excellent, Jules said, placing Avasaralas hand on his arm and leading her to an enormous table.They were surrounded on all sides by men in white jackets with black bow ties.One of them darted forward and pulled a chair out.Jules placed Avasarala in it.Chef Marco has promised something special tonight.How about straight answers?Are those on the menu?Bobbie asked as a waiter pulled out a chair for her.Jules settled into his chair at the head of the table.Answers?You guys won, Bobbie said, ignoring the steaming soup one of the servers placed in front of her.Mao tapped salt onto his and began eating it as though they were just having casual dinner conversation.The assistant undersecretary is on the ship.No reason to bullshit us now.Whats going on?Humanitarian aid, he replied.Bullshit, Bobbie said.She glanced at Avasarala, but the old woman was just smiling.You cant tell me that you have time to spend a couple months doing the transit to Jupiter just to oversee handing out rice and juice boxes.And you couldnt get enough relief supplies onto this ship to feed Ganymede lunch, much less make a long term difference.Mao settled back in his chair, and the white jackets bustled around the room, clearing the soup away.Bobbies was whisked away as well, even though she hadnt eaten any of it.Roberta, Mao began.Dont call me Roberta.Sergeant, you should be questioning your superiors at the UN foreign office, not me.Id love to, but apparently asking questions is against the rules in this game.His smile was warm, condescending, and empty.I made my ship available to provide Madam Undersecretary the most comfortable ride to her new assignment.And while you have not yet met them, there are personnel currently on this vessel whose expertise will be invaluable to the citizens of Ganymede once you arrive.Bobbie had been around Avasarala long enough to see the game being played right in front of her.Mao was laughing at her.He knew this was all bullshit, and he knew she knew it as well.But as long as he remained calm and gave reasonable answers, no one could call him on it.He was too powerful to be called a liar to his face.Youre a liar, and  she started; then something hed said made her stop.Wait, once you arrive?You arent coming?Im afraid not, Mao said, smiling up at the white jacket who placed another plate in front of him.This one had what appeared to be a whole fish, complete with head and staring eyes.Bobbie gaped at Avasarala, who was frowning at Mao now.I was told you were personally leading this relief effort, Avasarala said.That was my intention.But Im afraid other business has removed that option.Once we finish with this excellent dinner, Ill be taking the shuttle back to the station.This ship, and its crew, are at your disposal until your vital work on Ganymede is complete.Avasarala just stared at Mao.For the first time in Bobbies experience, the old lady was struck speechless.A white jacket brought Bobbie a fish while her lush prison flew at a leisurely quarter g toward Jupiter.Avasarala hadnt said a word on the ride down the lift to their suite.In the lounge, she stopped long enough to grab a bottle of gin off the bar, and waggled a finger at Bobbie.Bobbie followed her into the master bedroom, Cotyar close behind.Once the door was closed and Cotyar had used his handheld security terminal to scan the room for bugs, Avasarala said, Bobbie, start thinking of a way to either get control of this ship or get us off of it.Forget that, Bobbie said.Lets go grab that shuttle Maos leaving on right now.Its within range of his station or he wouldnt be taking it.To her surprise, Cotyar nodded.I agree with the sergeant.If we plan to leave, the shuttle will be easier to commandeer and control against a hostile crew.Avasarala sat down on her bed with a long exhale that turned into a heavy sigh.I cant leave yet.It doesnt work that way.The fucking game!Bobbie yelled.Yes, Avasarala snapped.Yes, the fucking game.Ive been ordered by my superiors to make this trip.If I leave now, Im out.Theyll be polite and call it a sudden illness or exhaustion, but the excuse they give me will also be the reason Im not allowed to keep doing my job.Ill be safe, and Ill be powerless.As long as I pretend Im doing what they asked me to, I can keep working.Im still the assistant undersecretary of executive administration.I still have connections.Influence.If I run now, I lose them.If I lose them, these fuckers might as well shoot me.But, Bobbie said.But, Avasarala repeated.If I continue to be effective, theyll find a way to cut me off.Unexplained comm failure, something.Something to keep me off the network.When that happens, I will demand that the captain reroute to the closest station for repairs.If Im right, he wont do it.Ah, Bobbie said.Oh, Cotyar said a moment later.Yes, Avasarala said.When that happens, I will declare this an illegal seizure of my person, and you will get me this ship.Thirty One: Prax  With every day that passed, the question came closer: What was the next step?It didnt feel all that different from those first, terrible days on Ganymede, making lists as a way of telling himself what to do.Only now he wasnt only looking for Mei.He was looking for Strickland.Or the mysterious woman in the video.Or whoever had built the secret lab.In that sense, he was much better off than he had been before.On the other hand, he had been searching Ganymede.Now the field had expanded to include everywhere.The lag time to Earth or Luna, actually, since Persis Strokes Security Consultants was based in orbit rather than down the planets gravity well was a little over twenty minutes.It made actual conversation essentially impossible, so in practice, the hatchet faced woman on his screen was making a series of promotional videos more and more specifically targeted to what Prax wanted to hear.We have an intelligence sharing relationship with Pinkwater, which is presently the security company with the largest physical and operational presence in the outer planets, she said.We also have joint action contracts with Al Abbiq and Star Helix.With those, we can take immediate action either directly or through our partners, on literally any station or planet in the system.Prax nodded to himself.That was exactly what he needed.Someone with eyes everywhere, with contacts everywhere.Someone who could help.Im attaching a release, the woman said.We will need payment for the processing fee, but we wont be charging your accounts for anything more than that until weve agreed on the scope of the investigation youre willing to be liable for.Once we have that in hand, I will send you a detailed proposal with an itemized spreadsheet and we can decide the scope of work that works best for you.Thank you, Prax said.He pulled up the document, signed off, and returned it.It would be twenty minutes at the speed of light before it reached Luna.Twenty minutes back.Who knew how long in between?It was a start.He could feel good about that, at least.The ship was quiet in a way that felt like anticipation, but Prax didnt know exactly what of.The arrival at Tycho Station, but beyond that, he wasnt sure.Leaving his bunk behind, he went through the empty galley and up the ladder toward the ops center and then the pilots station.The small room was dim, most of the light coming from the control panels and the sweep of high definition screens that filled 270 degrees of vision with starlight, the distant sun, and the approaching mass of Tycho Station, the oasis in the vast emptiness.Hey there, Doc, Alex said from the pilots couch.Come up to see the view?If I mean, if thats all right.Not a problem.I havent been running with a copilot since we got the Roci.Strap in right there.Just if somethin happens, dont touch anything.I wont, Prax promised as he scrambled into the acceleration couch.At first, the station seemed to grow slowly.The two counter rotating rings were hardly larger than Praxs thumb, the sphere they surrounded little more than a gum ball.Then, as they drew nearer, the fuzzy texture at the edge of the construction sphere began to resolve into massive waldoes and gantries reaching toward a strangely aerodynamic form.The ship under construction was still half undressed, ceramic and steel support beams open to the vacuum like bones.Tiny fireflies flickered inside and out: welders and sealant packs firing off too far away to see apart from the light.Is that built for atmosphere?Nope.Kinda looks that way, though.Thats the Chesapeake.Or it will be, anyway.Shes designed for sustained high g.  I think theyre talkin about running the poor bastard at something like eight g for a couple of months.All the way where?Prax asked, doing a little napkin back math in his head.It would have to be outside the orbit of anything.Yep, shell be going deep.Theyre going after that Nauvoo.The generation ship that was supposed to knock Eros into the sun?Thats the one.They cut her engines when the plan went south, but shes been cruisin on ever since.Wasnt finished, so they cant bring her around on remote.Instead, theyre buildin a retriever.Hope they manage too.The Nauvoo was an amazin piece of work.Of course, even if they get her back, it wont keep the Mormons from suing Tycho into nonexistence if they can figure out how.Why would that be hard?OPA doesnt recognize the courts on Earth and Mars, and they run the ones in the Belt.So its pretty much win in a court that doesnt matter or lose in one that does.Oh, Prax said.On the screens, Tycho Station grew larger and more detailed.Prax couldnt tell what detail of it brought it into perspective, but between one heartbeat and the next, he understood the scope and size of the station before him and let out a little gasp.The construction sphere had to be half a kilometer across, like two complete farm domes stuck bottom to bottom.Slowly, the great industrial sphere grew until it filled the screens, starlight replaced by the glow from equipment guides and a glass domed observation bubble.Steel and ceramic plates and scaffolds took the place of the blackness.There were the massive drives that could push the entire station, like a city in the sky, anywhere in the solar system.There were the complex swivel points, like the gimbals of a crash couch made by giants, that would reconfigure the station as a whole when thrust gravity took rotations place.It took his breath away.The elegance and functionality of the structure lay out before him, as beautiful and simple and effective as a leaf or a root cluster.To have something so much like the fruits of evolution, but designed by human minds, was awe inspiring.It was the pinnacle of what creativity meant, the impossible made real.Thats good work, Prax said.Yup, Alex said.And then on the shipwide channel: Weve arrived.Everyone strap in for docking.Im going to manual.Prax half rose in his couch.Should I go to my quarters?Where you ares as good as anyplace.Just put the web on in case we bump against somethin, Alex said.And then, his voice changing to a stronger, more clipped cadence: Tycho control, this is the Rocinante.Are we cleared for docking?Prax heard a distant voice speaking to Alex alone.Roger that, Alex said.Were comin in.In the dramas and action films that Prax had watched back on Ganymede, piloting a ship had always looked like a fairly athletic thing.Sweating men dragging hard against the control bars.Watching Alex was nothing like it.He still had the two joysticks, but his motions were small, calm.A tap, and the gravity under Prax changed, his couch shifting under him by a few centimeters.Then another tap and another shift.The heads up display showed a tunnel through the vacuum outlined in a blue and gold that swept up and to the right, ending against the side of the turning ring.Prax looked at the mass of data being sent to Alex and said, Why fly at all?Couldnt the ship just use this data to do the docking itself?Why fly?Alex repeated with a laugh.Cuz its fun, Doc.Because its fun.The long bluish lights of the windows in Tychos observation dome were so clear Prax could see the people looking out at him.He could almost forget that the screens in the cockpit werent windows: The urge to look out and wave, to watch someone wave back, was profound.Holdens voice came over Alexs line, the words unidentifiable and the tone perfectly clear.Were looking fine, Cap, Alex said.Ten more minutes.The crash couch shifted to the side, the wide plane of the station curving down as Alex matched the rotation.To generate even a third of a g on a ring that wide would demand punishing inertial forces, but under Alexs hand, ship and station drifted together slowly and gently.Before Prax had gotten married, hed seen a dance performance based on neo Taoist traditions.For the first hour, it had been utterly boring, and then after that, the small movements of arms and legs and torso, shifting together, bending, and falling away, had been entrancing.The Rocinante slid into place beside an extending airlock port with the same beauty Prax had seen in that dance, but made more powerful by the knowledge that instead of skin and muscles, this was tons of high tensile steel and live fusion reactors.The Rocinante eased into her berth with one last correction, one last shifting of the gimbaled couches.The final matching spin had been no more than any of the small corrections Alex had made on the way in.There was a disconcerting bang as the stations docking hooks latched on to the ship.Tycho control, Alex said.This is the Rocinante confirming dock.We have seal on the airlock.We are reading the clamps in place.Can you confirm?A moment passed, and a mutter.Thank you too, Tycho, Alex said.Its good to be back.Gravity in the ship had shifted subtly.Instead of thrust from the drive creating the illusion of weight, it now came from the spin of the ring they were clamped to.Prax felt like he was tilting slightly to the side whenever he stood up straight, and had to fight the urge to overcompensate by leaning the other way.Holden was in the galley when Prax reached it, the coffee machine pouring black and hot, with just the slightest bend to the stream.Coriolis effect, a dimly remembered high school class reminded Prax.Amos and Naomi came in together.They were all together now, and Prax felt the time was right to thank them all for what theyd done for him.For Mei, who was probably dead.The naked pain on Holdens face stopped him.Naomi stood in front of him, a duffel bag over her shoulder.Youre heading out, Holden said.I am.Her voice was light, but it had meaning radiating from it like harmonic overtones.Prax blinked.All right, then, Holden said.For a few seconds, no one moved; then Naomi darted in, kissing Holden lightly on the cheek.The captains arms moved out to embrace her, but shed already stepped away, marching out through the narrow hallway with the air of a woman on her way someplace.Holden took his coffee.Amos and Alex exchanged glances.Ah, Capn?Alex asked.Compared to the voice of the man whod just put a nuclear warship against a spinning metal wheel in the middle of interplanetary space, this voice was hesitant and concerned.Are we lookin for a new XO?Were not looking for anything until I say so, Holden said.Then, his voice quieter: But, God, I hope not.Yessir, Alex said.Me too.The four men stood for a long, awkward moment.Amos was the first to speak.You know, Cap, he said, the place Ive got booked has room for two.If you want the spare bunk, its yours.No, Holden said.He didnt look at them as he spoke, but reached out his hand and pressed his palm to the wall.Im staying on the Roci.Ill be right here.You sure?Amos asked, and again it seemed to mean something more than Prax could understand.Im not going anywhere, Holden said.All right, then.Prax cleared his throat, and Amos took his elbow.What about you?Amos said.You got a place to bunk down?Praxs prepared speech  I wanted to tell you all how much I appreciate ran into the question, derailing both thoughts.I ah I dont, but   Right, then.Get your stuff, and you can come with me.Well, yes.Thank you.But first I wanted to tell you all   Amos put a solid hand on his shoulder.Maybe later, the big man said.Right now, how about you just come with me?Holden leaned against the wall now.His jaw was set hard, like that of a man about to scream or vomit or weep.His eyes were looking at the ship but seeing past it.Sorrow welled up in Prax as if he were looking into a mirror.Yeah, he said.Okay.Amos rooms were, if anything, smaller than the bunks on the Rocinante: two small privacy areas, a common space less than half the size of the galley, and a bathroom with a fold out sink and toilet in the shower stall.It would have induced claustrophobia if Amos had actually been there.Instead, hed seen Prax settled in, taken a quick shower, and headed out into the wide, luxurious passageways of the station.There were plants everywhere, but for the most part they seemed decorative.The curve of the decks was so slight Prax could almost imagine he was back on some unfamiliar part of Ganymede, that his hole was no more than a tube ride away.That Mei would be there, waiting for him.Prax let the outer door close, pulled out his hand terminal, and connected to the local network.There was still no reply from Persis Strokes, but it was probably too early to expect one.In the meantime, the problem was money.If he was going to fund this, he couldnt do it alone.Which meant Nicola.Prax set up his terminal, turning the camera on himself.The image on the screen looked thin, wasted.The weeks had dried him out, and his time on the Rocinante hadnt completely rebuilt him.He might never be rebuilt.The sunken cheeks on the screen might be who he was now.That was fine.He started recording.Hi, Nici, he said.I wanted you to know Im safe.I got to Tycho Station, but I still dont have Mei.Im hiring a security consultant.Im giving them everything I know.They seem like theyll really be able to help.But its expensive.It may be very expensive.And she may already be dead.Prax took a moment to catch his breath.She may already be dead, he said again.But I have to try.I know you arent in a great financial position right now.I know youve got your new husband to think of.But if you have anything you can spare not for me.I dont want anything from you.Just Mei.For her.If you can give her anything, this is the last chance.He paused again, his mind warring between Thank you and Its the least you can fucking do.In the end, he just shut off the recording and sent it.The lag between Ceres and Tycho Station was fifteen minutes, given their relative positions.And even then, he didnt know what the local schedule there was.He might be sending his message in the middle of the night or during dinnertime.She might not have anything to say to him.It didnt matter.He had to try.He could sleep if he knew hed done everything he could to try.He recorded and sent messages to his mother, to his old roommate from college whod taken a position on Neptune Station, to his postdoctorate advisor.Each time, the story got a little easier to tell.The details started coming together, one leading into another.With them, he didnt talk about the protomolecule.At best, it would have scared them.At worst, theyd have thought the loss had broken his mind.When the last message was gone, he sat quietly.There was one other thing he thought he had to do now that he had full communication access.It wasnt what he wanted.He started the recording.Basia, he said.This is Praxidike.I wanted you to know that I know Katoa is dead.I saw the body.It didnt it didnt look like he suffered.And I thought, if I was in your place, that wondering wondering would be worse.Im sorry.Im just  He turned off the recording, sent it, and crawled onto the small bed.Hed expected it to be hard and uncomfortable, but the mattress was as cradling as crash couch gel, and he fell asleep easily and woke four hours later like someone had flipped a switch on the back of his head.Amos was still gone, even though it was station midnight.There was still no message from Persis Strokes, so Prax recorded a polite inquiry just to be sure the information hadnt gotten lost in transit then watched it and erased it.He took a long shower, washing his hair twice, shaved, and recorded a new inquiry, looking less like a raving lunatic.Ten minutes after he sent it, a new message alert chimed.Intellectually, he knew it couldnt be a response.With lag, his message wouldnt even be at Luna yet.When he pulled it up, it was Nicola.The heart shaped face looked older than he remembered it.There was the first dusting of gray at her temples.But when she made that soft, sad smile, he was twenty again, sitting across from her in the grand park while bhangra throbbed and lasers traced living art on the domed ice above them.He remembered what it had been like to love her.I have your message, she said.Im Im so sorry, Praxidike.I wish there was more I could do.Things arent so good here on Ceres.I will talk with Taban.He makes more than I do, and if he understands whats happened, he might want to help too.For my sake.Take care of yourself, old man.You look tired.On the screen, Meis mother leaned forward and stopped the recording.An icon showed an authorized transfer code for eighty FusionTek Real.Prax checked the exchange rates, converting the company scrip to UN dollars.It was almost a weeks salary.Not enough.Not near enough.But still, it had been a sacrifice for her.He pulled the message back up, pausing it in the gap between two words.Nicola looked out at him from the terminal, her lips parted barely enough for him to see her pale teeth.Her eyes were sad and playful.Hed thought for so long that it was her soul and not just an accident of physiology that gave her that look of fettered joy.Hed been wrong.As he sat, lost in history and imagination, a new message appeared.It was from Luna.Persis Strokes.With a feeling somewhere between anxiety and hope, he went to the attached spreadsheet.At the first set of numbers, his heart sank.Mei might be out there.She might be alive.Certainly Strickland and his people were there.They could be found.They could be caught.There was justice to be had.He just couldnt afford it.Thirty Two: Holden  H olden sat in a pull down chair in the Rocinantes engineering bay reviewing the damage and making notes for Tychos repair crew.Everyone else was gone.Some more than others, he thought.REPLACE STARBOARD ENGINEERING BULKHEAD.SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO PORT SIDE POWER CABLE JUNCTION, POSSIBLY REPLACE ENTIRE JUNCTION BOX.Two lines of text representing hundreds of work hours, hundreds of thousands of dollars in parts.It also represented the aftermath of coming within a hands breadth of fiery annihilation for the ship and crew.Describing it in two quick sentences felt almost sacrilegious.He made a footnote of the types of civilian parts that Tycho was likely to have available that would work with his Martian warship.Behind him, a wall monitor streamed a Ceres based news show.Holden had turned it on to keep his mind occupied while he tinkered with the ship and made notes.Which was all bullshit, of course.Sam, the Tycho engineer who usually took the lead on their repair jobs, didnt need his help.She didnt need him making lists of parts for her.She was, in every sense, better qualified to be doing what he was doing right now.But as soon as he turned the job over to her, he wouldnt have any reason to stay on the ship.He would have to confront Fred about the protomolecule on Ganymede.And maybe lose Naomi in the process.If his early suspicion was correct and Fred actually had bartered using the protomolecule as currency or, worse, as a weapon, Holden would kill him.He knew that like he knew his own name, and he feared it.That it would be a capital offense and would almost certainly get him burned down on the spot was actually less important than the fact that it would be the final proof that Naomi was right to leave.That hed turned into the man she feared he was becoming.Just another Detective Miller, dispensing frontier justice from the barrel of his gun.But whenever he pictured the scene, Freds admission of guilt and heartfelt appeal for mercy, Holden couldnt picture not killing him for what hed done.He remembered being the sort of man who would make a different choice, but he couldnt actually remember what being that man was like.If he was wrong, and Fred had nothing to do with the tragedy on Ganymede, then shed have been right all along, and he had just been too stubborn to see it.He might be able to apologize for that with sufficient humility to win her back.Stupidity was usually a lesser crime than vigilantism.But if Fred wasnt the one playing God with the alien supervirus, that was much, much worse for humanity in general.It was an unpleasant thought that the truth that would be worst for humanity was the one that would be best for him.Intellectually, he knew he wouldnt hesitate to sacrifice himself or his happiness to save everyone else.But that didnt stop the tiny voice at the back of his head that said, Fuck everyone else, I want my girlfriend back.Something half remembered pushed up from his subconscious and he wrote MORE COFFEE FILTERS on his list of needed supplies.The wall panel behind him chimed an alert half a second before his hand terminal buzzed to let him know someone was at the airlock, requesting permission to board.He tapped the screen to switch to the airlocks outer door camera and saw Alex and Sam waiting in the corridor.Sam was still the adorable red haired pixie in the oversized gray coveralls he remembered.She was carrying a large toolbox and laughing.Alex said something else and she laughed harder, almost dropping her tools.With the intercom off, it was a silent movie.Holden tapped the intercom button and said, Come on in, guys.Another tap cycled the outer airlock doors open.Sam waved at the camera and stepped inside.A few minutes later, the pressure hatch to engineering banged open, and the ladder lift whined its way down.Sam and Alex stepped off, Sam dropping her tools onto the metal deck with a loud crash.Whats up?she said, giving Holden a quick hug.You getting my girl all shot up again?Your girl?Alex said.Not this time, Holden replied, pointing out the damaged bulkheads in the engineering bay to her.Bomb went off in the cargo bay, burned a hole there and threw some shrapnel into the power junction there.Sam whistled.Either that shrapnel took the long way around, or your reactor knows how to duck.How long, you think?Bulkheads simple, she said, punching something into her terminal, then tapping her front teeth with its corner.We can bring a patch in through the cargo bay in a single piece.Makes the job a lot easier.Power junction takes longer, but not a lot.Say four days if I get my crew on it right now.Well, Holden said, wincing like a man who had to keep admitting to new wrongdoings.We also have a damaged cargo bay door that will either have to be fixed or replaced.And our cargo bay airlock is kind of messed up.Couple more days, then, Sam said, then knelt down and began pulling things out of her toolbox.Mind if I start taking some measurements?Holden waved at the wall.Be my guest.Been watching the news a lot?Sam said, pointing at the talking heads on the wall monitor.Ganymede is fucked, right?Yeah, Alex said.Pretty much.But its only Ganymede so far, Holden said.So that means something I havent quite figured out yet.Naomis staying with me right now, Sam said as if theyd been talking about that all along.Holden felt his face go still and tried to fight against it, forcing himself to smile.Oh.Cool.She wont talk about it, but if I find out you did something shitty to her, Im using this on your dick, she said, holding up a torque wrench.Alex laughed nervously for a second, then trailed off and just looked uncomfortable.I consider myself fairly warned, Holden said.How is she?Quiet, Sam said.Okay, got what I need.Gonna scoot now and get fabrication to work on cutting this bulkhead patch.See you boys around.Bye, Sam, Alex said, watching her ride the ladder lift until the pressure door closed behind her.Im twenty years too old, and Im pretty sure Ive got the wrong plumbin, but I like that gal.You and Amos just trade this crush back and forth?Holden said.Or should I be worried about you two doing pistols at dawn over her?My love is a pure love, Alex said with a grin.I wouldnt sully it by actually, you know, doin anything about it.The kind poets write about, then.So, Alex said, leaning against a wall and looking at his nails.Lets talk about the XO situation.Lets not.Oh, lets do, Alex said, then took a step forward and crossed his arms like a man who was not going to give any ground.Ive been flyin this boat solo for over a year now.That only works because Naomi is a brilliant ops officer and takes up a whole lotta slack.If we lose her, we dont fly.And thats a fact.Holden dropped the hand terminal hed been using into his pocket and slumped back against the reactor shielding.I know.I know.I never thought shed actually do this.Leave, Alex said.Yeah.Weve never talked about pay, Alex said.We dont get salaries.Pay?Holden frowned at Alex and banged out a quick drumbeat on the reactor behind him.It echoed like a metal tomb.Every dime that Freds given us that hasnt gone to pay for operating the ship is in the account I set up.If you need some of it, twenty five percent of that money belongs to you.Alex shook his head and waved his hands.No, dont get me wrong.I dont need money, and I dont think youre stealin from us.Just pointing out that we never talked about pay.So?So that means we arent a normal crew.We arent workin the ship for money, or because a government drafted us.Were here because we want to be.Thats all youve got over us.We believe in the cause, and we want to be part of what youre doing.The minute we lose that, we might as well take a real payin job.But Naomi  Holden started.Was your girlfriend, Alex said with a laugh.Damn, Jim, have you seen her?She can get another boyfriend.In fact, you mind if I   I take your point.I hear you.I fucked it up, its my fault.I know that.All of it.I need to go see Fred and start thinking about how to put it all back together again.Unless Fred actually did do it.Yeah.Unless that.Ive been wondering when youd finally drop by, Fred Johnson said as Holden walked through his office door.Fred was looking both better and worse than when Holden had first met him a year earlier.Better because the Outer Planets Alliance, the quasi government that Fred was the titular head of, was no longer a terrorist organization, but a de facto government that could sit at the diplomatic table with the inner planets.And Fred had taken to the role of administrator with a relish he must not have felt for being a freedom fighter.It was visible in the relaxed set of his shoulders, and the half smile that had become his default expression.And worse because the last year and all the pressures of governance had aged him.His hair was both thinner and whiter, his neck a confusion of loose flesh and old, ropy muscle.His eyes had permanent bags under them now.His coffee colored skin didnt show many wrinkles, but it had a tinge of gray to it.But the smile he gave Holden was genuine, and he came around the desk to shake his hand and guide him to a chair.I read your report on Ganymede, Fred said.Talk to me about it.Impressions on the ground.Fred, Holden said.Theres something else.Fred nodded to him as he moved back around his desk and sat down.Go on.Holden started to speak, then stopped.Fred was staring at him.His expression hadnt changed, but his eyes were sharper, more focused.Holden felt a sudden and irrational fear that Fred already knew everything he was about to say.The truth was Holden had always been afraid of Fred.There was a duality to the man that left him on edge.Fred had reached out to the crew of the Rocinante at the exact moment theyd needed help the most.Hed become their patron, their safe harbor against the myriad enemies theyd gathered over the last year.And yet Holden couldnt forget that this was still Colonel Frederick Lucius Johnson, the Butcher of Anderson Station.A man who had spent the last decade helping to organize and run the Outer Planets Alliance, an organization that was capable of murder and terrorism to further its goals.Fred had almost certainly ordered some of those murders personally.It was entirely possible that the OPA leader version of Fred had killed more people than even the United Nations Marine colonel version of Fred had.Would he really balk at using the protomolecule to further his agenda?Maybe.Maybe that would be going too far.And hed been a friend, and he deserved the chance to defend himself.Fred, I  Holden started, then stopped.Fred nodded again, the smile slipping off his face and being replaced by a slight frown.Im not going to like this.It was a statement of fact.Holden grabbed the arms of the office chair and pushed himself to his feet.He shoved more violently than he wanted to and, in the low.3 g of station spin, flew off his feet for a second.Fred chuckled and the frown shifted back into a grin.And that was it.The grin and the laugh broke the fear and turned it into anger.When Holden settled back to his feet, he leaned forward and slammed both palms onto Freds desk.You, he said, dont get to laugh.Not until I know for sure it wasnt all your fault.If you can do what I think you might have done and still laugh, I will shoot you right here and now.Freds smile didnt change, but something in his eyes did.He wasnt used to being threatened, but it wasnt new territory either.What I might have done, Fred said, not turning it into a question, just repeating it back.Its the protomolecule, Fred.Thats whats happening on Ganymede.A lab with kids as experiments and that black webbing shit and a monster that almost killed my ship.Thats my fucking impression on the ground.Someone has been playing with the bug, and it might be loose, and the inner planets are shooting each other to shit in orbit around it.You think I did this, Fred said.Again, just a flat statement of fact.We threw this shit into Venus, Holden yelled.I gave you the only sample.And suddenly Ganymede, breadbasket of your future empire, the one place the inner navies wont cede control of, gets a fucking outbreak?Fred let the silence answer for a beat.Are you asking me if Im using the protomolecule to drive the inner planets troops off Ganymede, and strengthen my control of the outer planets?Freds quiet tone made Holden realize how loud hed gotten, and he took a moment to take several deep breaths.When his pulse had slowed a bit, he said, Yes.Pretty much exactly that.You, Fred said with a broad smile that did not extend to his eyes, do not get to ask me that.What?In case youve forgotten, you are an employee of this organization.Fred stood up, stretching to his full height, a dozen centimeters taller than Holden.His smile didnt change, but his body shifted and sort of spread out.Suddenly he looked very large.Holden took a step back before he could stop himself.I, Fred continued, owe you nothing but the terms of our latest contract.Have you completely lost your mind, boy?Charging in here?Shouting at me?Demanding answers?No one else could have  Holden started, but Fred ignored him.You gave me the only sample we knew of.But you assume that if you dont know about it, it doesnt exist.Ive been putting up with your bullshit for over a year now, Fred said.This idea you have that the universe owes you answers.This righteous indignation you wield like a club at everyone around you.But I dont have to put up with your shit.Do you know why that is?Holden shook his head, afraid if he spoke, it might come out as a squeak.Its because, Fred said, Im the fucking boss.I run this outfit.Youve been pretty useful, and you might be again in the future.But I have enough shit to deal with right now without you starting another one of your crusades at my expense.So, Holden said, letting the word drag to two syllables.So youre fired.This was your last contract with me.Ill finish fixing the Roci and Ill pay you, because I dont break a deal.But I think weve finally built enough ships to start policing our own sky without your help, and even if we havent, Im just about done with you.Fired, Holden said.Now get the hell out of my office before I decide to take the Roci too.Shes got more Tycho parts on her now than originals.I think I might be able to make a good argument I own that ship.Holden backed up toward the door, wondering how serious that threat might actually be.
