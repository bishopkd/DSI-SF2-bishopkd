Fred watched him go but didnt move.When he reached the door, Fred said, It wasnt me.Their gazes met for a long, breathless moment.It wasnt me, Fred repeated.Holden said, Okay, and backed out the door.When the door slid shut and blocked Fred from view, Holden let out a long sigh and collapsed against the corridor wall.Fred was right about one thing: Hed been excusing himself with his fear for far too long.This righteous indignation you wield like a club at everyone around you.Hed seen humanity almost end due to its own stupidity.It had left him shaken to the core.Hed been running on fear and adrenaline ever since Eros.But it wasnt an excuse.Not anymore.He started to pull out his terminal to call Naomi when it hit him like a light turning on.Im fired.Hed been on an exclusive contract with Fred for over a year.Tycho Station was their home base.Sam had spent almost as much time tuning and patching the Roci as Amos had.That was all gone.Theyd have to find their own jobs, find their own ports, buy their own repairs.No more patron to hold his hand.For the first time in a very long time, Holden was a real independent captain.Hed need to earn his way by keeping the ship in the air and the crew fed.He paused for a moment, letting that sink in.It felt great.Thirty Three: Prax  Amos sat forward in his chair.The sheer physical mass of the man made the room seem smaller, and the smell of alcohol and old smoke came off him like heat from a fire.His expression couldnt have been more gentle.I dont know what to do, Prax said.I just dont know what to do.This is all my fault.Nicola was just she was so lost and so angry.Every day, I woke up and I looked over at her, and all I saw was how trapped she was.And I knew Mei was going to grow up with that.With trying to get her mommy to love her when all Nici wanted to do was be somewhere else.And I thought it would be better.When she started talking about going, I was ready for her to do it, you know?And when Mei when I had to tell Mei that  Prax dropped his head into his hands, rocking slowly back and forth.You gonna sick up again, Doc?No.Im fine.If Id been a better father to her, shed still be here.We talking about the ex wife or the kid?I dont care about Nicola.If Id been there for Mei.If Id gone to her as soon as we got the warning.If I hadnt waited there in the dome.And for what?Plants?Theyre dead now anyway.I had one, but I lost it, too.I couldnt even save one.But I could have gotten there.Found her.If Id   You know she was gone before the shit hit the fan, right?Prax shook his head.He wasnt about to let reality forgive him.And this.I had a chance.I got out.I got some money.And I was stupid.It was her last chance, and I was stupid about it.Yeah, well.Youre new at this, Doc.She should have had a better dad.She deserved a better dad.Was such a good she was such a good girl.For the first time, Amos touched him.The wide hand took his shoulder, gripping him from collarbone to scapula and bending Praxs spine until it was straight.Amos eyes were more than bloodshot, white sclera marbled with red.His breath was hot and astringent, the platonic ideal of a sailor on a shore leave bender.But his voice was sober and steady.Shes got a fine daddy, Doc.You give a shit, and thats more than a lot of people ever do.Prax swallowed.He was tired.He was tired of being strong, of being hopeful and determined and preparing for the worst.He didnt want to be himself anymore.He didnt want to be anyone at all.Amos hand felt like a ship clamp, keeping Prax from spinning away into darkness.All he wanted was to be let go.Shes gone, Prax said.It felt like a good excuse.An explanation.They took her away from me, and I dont know who they are, and I cant get her back, and I dont understand.It aint over yet.Prax nodded, not because he was actually comforted, but because this was the moment when he knew he should act like he was.Im never going to find her.Youre wrong.The door chimed and slid open.Holden stepped in.Prax couldnt see at first what was different about him, but that something had happened had changed was unmistakable.The face was the same; the clothes hadnt changed.Prax had the uncanny memory of sitting through a lecture on metamorphosis.Hey, Holden said.Everything all right?Little bumpy, Amos said.Prax saw his own confusion mirrored in Amos face.They were both aware of the transformation, and neither of them knew what it was.You get laid or something, Cap?No, Holden said.I mean, good on you if you did, Amos said.It just wasnt how I pictured   I didnt get laid, Holden said hesitantly.The smile that came after was almost radiant.I got fired.Just you got fired, or all of us?All of us.Huh, Amos said.He went still for a moment, then shrugged.All right.I need to talk to Naomi, but shes not accepting connections from me.Do you think you could track her down?Discomfort pursed Amos lips like hed sucked on an old lemon.Im not going to pick a fight, Holden said.We just didnt leave it in the right place.And its my fault, so I need to fix it.I know she was hanging out down in that one bar Sam told us about last time.The Blauwe Blome.But you make a dick of yourself and Im not the one that told you.Not a problem, Holden said.Thanks.The captain turned to leave and then stopped in the doorway.He looked like someone still half in a dream.Whats bumpy?he asked.You said it was bumpy.The doc was looking to hire on some Luna private security squad to track the kid down.Didnt work out and he kind of took it bad.Holden frowned.Prax felt the heat of a blush pushing up his neck.I thought we were finding the kid, Holden said.He sounded genuinely confused.Doc wasnt clear on that.Oh, Holden said.He turned to Prax.Were finding your kid.You dont need to get someone else.I cant pay you, Prax said.All my accounts were on the Ganymede system, and even if theyre still there, I cant access them.I just have what people are giving me.I can probably get something like a thousand dollars UN.Is that enough?No, Holden said.That wont buy a weeks air, much less water.Well have to take care of that.Holden tilted his head like he was listening to something only he could hear.Ive already talked to my ex wife, Prax said.And my parents.I cant think of anyone else.How about everyone?Holden said.Im James Holden, the captain said from the huge screen of the Rocinantes pilot capsule, and Im here to ask for your help.Four months ago, hours before the first attack on Ganymede, a little girl with a life threatening genetic illness was abducted from her day care.In the chaos that   Alex stopped the playback.Prax tried to sit up, but the gimbaled copilots chair only shifted under him, and he lay back.I dont know, Alex said from the pilots couch.The green background kinda makes him look pasty, dont you think?Prax narrowed his eyes a degree, considered, then nodded.Its not really his color, Prax said.Maybe if it was darker.Ill try that, the pilot said, tapping at his screen.Normally its Naomi who does this stuff.Communications packages aint exactly my first love.But well get it done.How about this?Better, Prax said.Im James Holden, and Im here to ask for your help.Four months ago  Holdens part of the little presentation was less than a minute, speaking into the camera from Amos hand terminal.After that, Amos and Prax had spent an hour trying to create the rest.Alex had been the one to suggest using the better equipment on the Rocinante.Once theyd done that, putting together the information had been easy.Hed taken the start hed made for Nicola and his parents as the template.Alex helped him record the rest an explanation of Meis condition; the security footage of Strickland and the mysterious woman taking her from the day care; the data from the secret lab, complete with images of the protomolecule filament; pictures of Mei playing in the parks; and a short video from her second birthday party, when she smeared cake frosting on her forehead.Prax felt odd watching himself speak.He had seen plenty of recordings of himself, but the man on the screen was thinner than hed expected.Older.His voice was higher than the one he heard in his own ears, and less hesitant.The Praxidike Meng who was about to be broadcast out to the whole of humanity was a different man than he was, but it was close enough.And if it helped to find Mei, it would do.If it brought her back, hed be anyone.Alex slid his fingers across his controls, rearranging the presentation, connecting the images of Mei to the timeline to Holden.They had set up an account with a Belt based credit union that had a suite of options for short term unincorporated nonprofit concerns so that any contributions could be accepted automatically.Prax watched, wanting badly to offer comment or take control.But there was nothing more to do.All right, Alex said.Thats about as pretty as I can make it.Okay, then, Prax said.What do we do with it now?Alex looked over.He seemed tired, but there was also an excitement.Hit send.But the review process  There is no review process, Doc.This isnt a government thing.Hell, its not even a business.Its just us monkeys flying fast and tryin to keep our butts out of the engine plume.Oh, Prax said.Really?You hang around the captain long enough, you get used to it.You might want to take a day, though.Think it through.Prax lifted himself on one elbow.Think what through?Sending this out.If it works the way were thinking, youre about to get a lot of attention.Maybe itll be what were hoping for; maybe itll be something else.All Im saying is you cant unscramble that egg.Prax considered for a few seconds.The screens glowed.Its Mei, Prax said.All right, then, Alex said, and shifted communication control to the copilots station.You want to do the honors?Where is it going?I mean, where are we sending it?Simple broadcast, Alex said.Probably get picked up by some local feeds in the Belt.But its the captain, so folks will watch it, pass it around on the net.And  And?We didnt put our hitchhiker in, but the filament out of that glass case?Were kind of announcing that the protomolecules still out there.Thats gonna boost the signal.And we think thats going to help?First time we did something like this, it started a war, Alex said.Help might be a strong word for it.Stir things up, though.Prax shrugged and hit send.Torpedoes away, Alex said, chuckling.Prax slept on the station, serenaded by the hum of the air recyclers.Amos was gone again, leaving only a note that Prax shouldnt wait up.It was probably his imagination that made the spin gravity seem to feel different.With a diameter as wide as Tychos, the Coriolis effect shouldnt have been uncomfortably noticeable, and certainly not when he lay there, motionless, in the darkness of his room.And still, he couldnt get comfortable.He couldnt forget that he was being turned, inertia pressing him against the thin mattress as his body tried to fly out into the void.Most of the time hed been on the Rocinante, hed been able to trick his mind into thinking that he had the reassuring mass of a moon under him.It wasnt, he decided, an artifact of how the acceleration was generated so much as what it meant.As his mind slowly spiraled down, bits of his self breaking apart like a meteor hitting atmosphere, he felt a massive welling up of gratitude.Part of it was to Holden and part to Amos.The whole crew of the Rocinante.Half dreaming, he was on Ganymede again.He was starving, walking down ice corridors with the certainty that somewhere nearby, one of his soybeans had been infected with the protomolecule and was tracking him, bent on revenge.With the broken logic of dreams, he was also on Tycho, looking for work, but all the people he gave his CV to shook their heads and told him he was missing some sort of degree or credential he didnt recognize or understand.The only thing that made it bearable was a deeper knowledge certain as bone that none of it was true.That he was sleeping, and that when he woke, he would be somewhere safe.What did wake him at last was the rich smell of beef.His eyes were crusted like hed been crying in his sleep, the tears leaving salt residues where theyd evaporated.The shower was hissing and splashing.Prax pulled on his jumpsuit, wondering again why it had TACHI printed across the back.Breakfast waited on the table: steak and eggs, flour tortillas, and black coffee.Real food that had cost someone a small fortune.There were two plates, so Prax chose one and started eating.It had probably cost a tenth of the money he had from Nicola, but it tasted wonderful.Amos ducked out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his hips.A massive white scar puckered the right side of his abdomen, pulling his navel off center, and a nearly photographic tattoo of a young woman with wavy hair and almond shaped eyes covered his heart.Prax thought there was a word under the tattooed face, but he didnt want to stare.Hey, Doc, Amos said.Youre looking better.I got some rest, Prax said as Amos walked into his own room and closed the door behind him.When Prax spoke again, he raised his voice.I want to thank you.I was feeling low last night.And whether you and the others can actually help find Mei or not   Why wouldnt we be able to find her?Amos asked, his voice muffled by the door.You aint losing respect for me, are you, Doc?No, Prax said.No, not at all.I only meant that what you and the captain are offering is its a huge  Amos came back out grinning.His jumpsuit covered scars and tattoos as if theyd never been.I knew what you meant.I was just joshing you.You like that steak?Keep wondering where they put the cows on this thing, dont you?Oh no, this is vat grown.You can tell from the way the muscle fibers grow.You see how these parts right here are layered?Actually makes it easier to get a good marbled cut than when you carve it out of a steer.No shit?Amos said, sitting across from him.I didnt know that.Microgravity also makes fish more nutritious, Prax said around a mouthful of egg.Increases the oil production.No one knows why, but there are a couple very interesting studies about it.They think it may not be the low g itself so much as the constant flow you have to have so that the animals dont stop swimming, make a bubble of oxygen depleted water, and suffocate.Amos ripped a bit of tortilla and dipped it into the yolk.This is what dinner conversations like in your family, aint it?Prax blinked.Mostly, yes.Why?What do you talk about?Amos chuckled.He seemed to be in a very good mood.There was a relaxed look about his shoulders, and something in the set of his jaw had changed.Prax remembered the previous nights conversation with the captain.You got laid, didnt you?Oh hell yes, Amos said.But thats not the best part.Its not?Oh, its a fucking good part, but theres nothing better in the world than getting a job the day after your ass gets canned.A pang of confusion touched Prax.Amos pulled his hand terminal out of his pocket, tapped it twice, and slid it across the table.The screen showed a red security border and the name of the credit union Alex had been working with the night before.When he saw the balance, his eyes went wide.Is is that?Thats enough to keep the Roci flying for a month, and we got it in seven hours, Amos said.You just hired yourself a team, Doc.I dont know really?Not just that.Take a look at the messages youve got coming in.Captain made a pretty big splash back in the day, but your kiddo?All that shit that came down on Ganymede just got itself a face, and its her.Prax pulled up his own terminal.The mailbox associated with the presentation had over five hundred video messages and thousands of texts.He began going through them.Men and women he didnt know some of them in tears  offered up their prayers and anger and support.A Belter with a wild mane of gray black hair gibbered in patois so thick Prax could barely make it out.As near as he could tell, the man was offering to kill someone for him.Half an hour later, Praxs eggs had congealed.A woman from Ceres told him that shed lost her daughter in a divorce, and that she was sending him her months chewing tobacco money.A group of food engineers on Luna had passed the hat and sent along what would have been a months salary if Prax had still been a botanist.An old Martian man with skin the color of chocolate and powdered sugar hair gazed seriously into a camera halfway across the solar system and said he was with Prax.When the next message began, it looked just like the others before it.The man in the image was older eighty, maybe ninety with a fringe of white hair clinging to the back of his skull and a craggy face.There was something about his expression that caught Praxs attention.A hesitance.Dr.Meng, the man said.He had a slushy accent that reminded Prax of recordings of his own grandfather.Im very sorry to hear of all you and your family have suffered.Are suffering.The man licked his lips.The security video on your presentation.I believe I know the man in it.But his name isnt Strickland     Thirty Four: Holden  According to the station directory, the Blauwe Blome was famous for two things: a drink called the Blue Meanie and its large number of Golgo tables.The guidebook warned potential patrons that the station allowed the bar to serve only two Blue Meanies to each customer due to the drinks fairly suicidal mixture of ethanol, caffeine, and methylphenidate.And, Holden guessed, some kind of blue food coloring.As he walked through the corridors of Tychos leisure section, the guidebook began explaining the rules of Golgo to him.After a few moments of utter confusion  goals are said to be borrowed when the defense deflects the drive he shut it off.There was very little chance he was going to be playing games.And a drink that removed your inhibitions and left you wired and full of energy would be redundant right now.The truth was Holden had never felt better in his life.Hed messed a lot of things up over the last year.Hed driven his crew away from him.Hed aligned himself with a side he wasnt sure he agreed with in exchange for safety.He might have ruined the one healthy relationship hed had in his life.Hed been driven by his fear to become someone else.Someone who handled fear by turning it into violence.Someone who Naomi didnt love, who his crew didnt respect, who he himself didnt like much.The fear wasnt gone.It was still there, making his scalp crawl every time he thought about Ganymede, and about what might be loose and growing there right now.But for the first time in a long time, he was aware of it and wasnt hiding from it.He had given himself permission to be afraid.It made all the difference.Holden heard the Blauwe Blome several seconds before he saw it.It began as a barely audible rhythmic thumping, which gradually increased in volume and picked up an electronic wail and a womans voice singing in mixed Hindi and Russian.By the time he reached the clubs front door, the song had changed to two men in an alternating chant that sounded like an argument set to music.The electronic wail was replaced by angry guitars.The bass line changed not at all.Inside, the club was an all out assault on the senses.A massive dance floor dominated the center space, and the dozens of bodies writhing on it were bathed in a constantly changing light show that shifted and flashed in time to the music.The music had been loud out in the corridor, but inside, it became deafening.A long chrome bar was set against one wall, and half a dozen bartenders were frantically filling drink orders.A sign on the back wall read GOLGO and had an arrow pointing down a long hallway.Holden followed it, the music fading with each step so that by the time he reached the back room with the game tables, it was back to being muted bass lines.Naomi was at one of the tables with her friend Sam the engineer and a cluster of other Belters.Her hair was pulled back with a red elastic band wide enough to be decorative.Shed switched out her jumpsuit for a pair of gray tailored slacks he hadnt known she owned and a yellow blouse that made her caramel colored skin seem darker.Holden had to stop for a moment.She smiled at someone who wasnt him, and his chest went tight.As he approached, Sam threw a small metal ball at the table.The group at the other end reacted with sudden violent movements.He couldnt see exactly what was happening from where he stood, but the slumped shoulders and halfhearted curses coming from the second group led Holden to believe that Sam had done something good for her team.Sam spun around and threw up her hand.The group at her end of the table, which included Naomi, took turns slapping her palm.Sam saw him first and said something he couldnt hear.Naomi turned around and gave him a speculative look that stopped him in his tracks.She didnt smile and she didnt frown.He raised his palms in what he hoped was an I didnt come to fight gesture.For a moment, they stood facing each other across the noisy room.Jesus, he thought, how did I let it come to this?Naomi nodded at him and pointed at a table in one corner of the room.He sat down and ordered himself a drink.Not one of the blue liver killers the bar was famous for, just a cheap Belt produced scotch.Hed grown to, if not appreciate, at least tolerate the faint mold aftertaste it always had.Naomi said goodbye to the rest of her team for a few minutes and then walked over.It wasnt a casual stroll, but it wasnt the gait of someone going to a dreaded meeting either.Can I order you something?Holden asked as she sat.Sure, Ill take a grapefruit martini, she said.While Holden entered the order on the table, she looked him over with a mysterious half smile that turned his belly to liquid.Okay, he said, authorizing his terminal to open a bar tab and pay for the drinks.One hideous martini on its way.Naomi laughed.Hideous?A near fatal case of scurvy being the only reason I can imagine drinking something with grapefruit juice in it.She laughed again, untying at least one of the knots in Holdens gut, and they sat together in companionable silence until the drinks arrived.She took a small sip and smacked her lips in appreciation, then said, Okay.Spill.Holden took a much longer drink, nearly finishing off the small glass of scotch in a single gulp, trying to convince himself that the spreading warmth in his belly could stand in for courage.I didnt feel comfortable with where we left things, and I thought that we should talk.Kind of process this together.He cleared his throat.I fucked everything up, he said.Ive treated my friends badly.Worse than badly.You were absolutely right to do what you did.I couldnt hear what you were saying at the time, but you were right to say it.Naomi took another drink of her martini, then casually reached up and pulled out the elastic band holding her masses of black curls behind her head.Her hair fell down around her face in a tangle, making Holden think of ivy covered stone walls.He realized that for as long as hed known her, Naomi had always let her hair down in emotional situations.She hid behind it, not literally, but because it was her best feature.The eye was just naturally drawn to its glossy black curls.A distraction technique.It made her suddenly seem very human, as vulnerable and lost as he was.Holden felt a rush of affection for her that must have showed on his face, because she looked at him and then blushed.What is this, Jim?An apology?he said.An admission that you were right, and that I was turning into my own screwed up version of Miller?Those at the very least.Hopefully opening the dialogue to reconciliation, if Im lucky.Im glad, Naomi said.Im glad youre figuring that out.But Ive been saying this for months now, and you   Wait, Holden said.He could feel her pulling back from him, not letting herself believe.All he had left to offer her was absolute truth, so he did.I couldnt hear you.Because Ive been terrified, and Ive been a coward.Fear doesnt make you a coward.No, he said.Of course it doesnt.But refusing to face up to it.To not admit to you how I felt.To not let you and Alex and Amos help me.That was cowardice.And it may have cost me you, the crews loyalty, everything I really care about.It made me keep a bad job a lot longer than I should have because the job was safe.A small knot of the Golgo players began drifting toward their table, and Holden was gratified when he saw Naomi wave them off.It meant she wanted to keep talking.That was a start.Tell me, she said.Where are you going from here?I have no idea, Holden replied with a grin.And thats the best feeling Ive had in ages.But no matter what happens next, I need you there.When she started to protest, Holden quickly put up a hand to stop her and said, No, I dont mean like that.Id love to win you back, but Im perfectly okay with the idea that it might take some time, or never happen at all.I mean the Roci needs you back.The crew needs you there.I dont want to leave her, Naomi said with a shy smile.Shes your home, Holden said.Always will be as long as you want it.And thats true no matter what happens between us.Naomi began wrapping one thick strand of hair around her finger and drank off the last of her drink.Holden pointed at the table menu, but she shook her hand at him.This is because you confronted Fred, right?Yeah, partly, Holden said.I was standing in his office feeling terrified and realizing Id been afraid for a long, long time.Ive screwed things up with him too.Some of thats probably his fault.Hes a true believer, and those are bad people to climb into bed with.But its mostly still mine.Did you quit?He fired me, but I was probably going to quit.So, Naomi said.Youve lost us our paying gig and our patron.I guess I feel a little flattered that the part youre trying to patch up is me.You, Holden said, are the only part I really care about fixing.You know what happens now, right?You move back onto the ship?Naomi just smiled the comment away.Now we pay for our own repairs.If we fire a torpedo, we have to find someone to sell us a new one.We pay for water, air, docking fees, food, and medical supplies for our very expensive automated sick bay.Have a plan for that?Nope!Holden said.But I have to say, for some reason, it feels great.And when the euphoria passes?Ill make a plan.Her smile grew reflective and she tugged on her lock of hair.Im not ready to move back to the ship right now, Naomi said, reaching across the table to take his hand in hers.But by the time the Roci is patched up, Ill need my cabin back.Ill move the rest of my stuff out immediately.Jim, she said, squeezing his fingers once before letting go.I love you, and were not okay yet.But this is a good start.And yes, Holden thought, it really was.Holden woke up in his old cabin on the Rocinante feeling better than he had in months.He climbed out of his bunk and wandered naked through the empty ship to the head.He took an hour long shower in water he actually had to pay for now, heated by electricity the dock would be charging him for by the kilowatt hour.He walked back to his bunk, drying skin made pink by the almost scalding water as he went.He made and ate a large breakfast and drank five cups of coffee while catching up on the technical reports on the Rocis repairs until he was sure he understood everything about what had been done.Holden had switched to reading a column about the state of Mars Earth relations by a political humorist when his terminal buzzed at him, and a call came through from Amos.Hey, Cap, he said, his big face filling the small screen.You coming over to the station today?Or should we come meet you on the Roci?Lets meet here, Holden replied.Sam and her team will be working today and I want to keep an eye on things.See you in a few, then, Amos said, and killed the connection.Holden tried to finish the humor column but kept getting distracted and having to read the same passage over again.He finally gave up and cleaned the galley for a while, then set the coffee maker to brew a fresh pot for Amos and the work crew when they arrived.The machine was gurgling happily to itself like a content infant when the deck hatch clanged open and Amos and Prax climbed down the crew ladder and into the galley.Cap, Amos said, dropping into a chair with a thump.Prax followed him into the room but didnt sit.Holden grabbed mugs and pulled two more cups of coffee, then set them on the table.Whats the news?he said.Amos answered with a shit eating grin and spun his terminal across the table to Holden.When Holden looked at it, it was displaying the account information for Praxs save Mei fund.It had just over half a million UN dollars in it.Holden whistled and slumped into a chair.Jesus grinned, Amos.Id hoped we might but never this.Yeah, it was a little under 300k this morning.Its gone up another 200k just over the last three hours.Seems like everyone following the Ganymede shit on the news has made little Mei the poster child for the tragedy.Is this enough?Prax cut in, anxiety in his voice.Oh, hell yes, Holden said with a laugh.Way more than enough.This will fund our rescue mission just fine.Also, we got a clue, Amos said, pausing dramatically to sip his coffee.About Mei?Yep, Amos said, adding a little more sugar to his cup.Prax, send him that message you got.Holden watched the message three times, grinning wider with each viewing.The security video on your presentation.I believe I know the man in it, the elderly gentleman on the screen was saying.But his name isnt Strickland.When I worked with him at Ceres Mining and Tech University, his name was Merrian.Carlos Merrian.That, Holden said after his final viewing, is what my old buddy Detective Miller might have called a lead.What now, chief?Amos asked.I think I need to make a phone call.Okay.The doc and I will get out of your hair and watch his money roll in.They left together, Holden waiting until the deck hatch slammed behind them to send a connection request to the switchboard at Ceres M amp;T.  The lag was running about fifteen minutes with Tychos current location, so he settled back and played a simple puzzle game on his terminal that left his mind free to think and plan.If they knew who Strickland had been before he was Strickland, they might be able to trace his career history.And somewhere along the way, hed stopped being a guy named Carlos who worked at a tech school, and became a guy named Strickland who stole little kids.Knowing why would be a good start to learning where he might be now.Almost forty minutes after sending out the request, he received a reply.He was a little surprised to see the elderly man from the video message.He hadnt expected to connect on his first try.Hello, the man said.Im Dr.Moynahan.Ive been expecting your message.I assume you want to know the details about Dr.Merrian.To make a long story short, he and I worked together at the CMTU biosciences lab.He was working on biological development constraint systems.He was never good at playing the university game.Didnt make many allies while he was here.So when he crossed some ethical gray areas, they were only too happy to run him out of town.I dont know the details on that.I wasnt his department head.Let me know if you need anything else.Holden watched the message twice, taking notes and cursing the fifteen minute lag.When he was ready, he sent a reply back.Thank you so much for the help, Dr.Moynahan.We really appreciate it.I dont suppose you know what happened after he was kicked out of the university, do you?Did he go to another institution?Take a corporate job?Anything?He hit send and sat back to wait again.He tried the puzzle game but got annoyed and turned it off.Instead, he pulled up the Tycho public entertainment feed and watched a childrens cartoon that was frantic and loud enough to distract him.When his terminal buzzed with the incoming message, he almost knocked it off the table in his haste to start the video.Actually, Dr.Moynahan said, scratching at the gray stubble on his chin while he spoke, he never even made it in front of the ethics review.Quit the day before.Made a lot of fuss, walking through the lab and yelling that we werent going to be able to push him around anymore.That he had a bigwig corporate job with all the funding and resources he wanted.Called us small minded pencil pushers stagnating in a quagmire of petty ethical constraints.Cant remember the name of the company he was going to work for, though.Holden hit pause and felt a chill go down his spine.Stagnating in a quagmire of petty ethical constraints.He didnt need Moynahan to tell him which company would snatch a man like that up.Hed heard almost those exact words spoken by Antony Dresden, the architect of the Eros project that had killed a million and a half people as part of a grand biology experiment.Carlos Merrian had gone to work for Protogen and disappeared.Hed come back as Strickland, abductor of small children.And, Holden thought, the murderer too.Thirty Five: Avasarala  On the screen, the young man laughed as he had laughed twenty five seconds earlier on Earth.It was the level of lag Avasarala hated the most.Too much for the conversation to feel anything like normal, but not quite enough to make it impossible.Everything she did took too long, every reading of reaction and nuance crippled by the effort to guess what exactly in her words and expression ten seconds before had elicited it.Only you, he said, could take another Earth Mars war, turn it into a private cruise, and then seem pissed off about it.Anyone in my office would give their left testicle to go with you.Next time Ill take up a collection, but   As far as an accurate military inventory, he said twenty five seconds ago, there are reports in place, but theyre not as good as Id like.Because its you, Ive got a couple of my interns building search parameters.My impression is that the research budget is about a tenth of the money going to actual research.With your clearances, I have rights to look at it, but these Navy guys are pretty good at obscuring things.I think youll find His expression clouded.A collection?Forget it.You were saying?She waited fifty seconds, resenting each individually.I dont know that well be able to get a definitive answer, the young man said.We might get lucky, but if its something they want to hide, they can probably hide it.Especially since theyll know youre looking for it, and what I asked you to look for, Avasarala thought.Even if the income stream between Mao Kwikowski, Nguyen, and Errinwright was in all the budgets right now, by the time Avasaralas allies looked, it would be hidden.All she could do was keep pushing on as many fronts as she could devise and hope that they fucked up.Three more days of information requests and queries, and she could ask for traffic analysis.She couldnt know exactly what information they were hiding, but if she could find out what kinds and categories of data they were keeping away from her, that would tell her something.Something, but not much.Do what you can, she said.Ill luxuriate out here in the middle of nowhere.Get back to me.She didnt wait fifty seconds for a round of etiquette and farewell.Life was too short for that shit.Her private quarters on the Guanshiyin were gorgeous.The bed and couch matched the deep carpet in tones of gold and green that should have clashed but didnt.The light was the best approximation of mid morning sunlight that shed ever seen, and the air recyclers were scented to give everything just a note of turned earth and fresh cut grass.Only the low thrust gravity spoiled the illusion of being in a private country club somewhere in the green belt of south Asia.The low gravity and the goddamned lag.She hated low gravity.Even if the acceleration was perfectly smooth and the yacht never had to shift or move to avoid debris, her guts were used to a full g pulling things down.She hadnt digested anything well since shed come on board, and she always felt short of breath.Her system chimed.A new report from Venus.She popped it open.The preliminary analysis of the wreckage from the Arboghast was under way.There was some ionizing in the metal that was apparently consistent with someones theory of how the protomolecule functioned.It was the first time a prediction had been confirmed, the first tiny toehold toward a genuine understanding of what was happening on Venus.There was an exact timing of the three energy spikes.There was a spectral analysis of the upper atmosphere of Venus that showed more elemental nitrogen than expected.Avasarala felt her eyes glazing over.The truth was she didnt care.She should.It was important.Possibly more important than anything else that was happening.But just like Errinwright and Nguyen and all the others, she was caught up in this smaller, human struggle of war and influence and the tribal division between Earth and Mars.The outer planets too, if you took them seriously.Hell, at this point she was more worried about Bobbie and Cotyar than she was about Venus.Cotyar was a good man, and his disapproval left her feeling defensive and pissed off.And Bobbie looked like she was about to crack.And why not?The woman had watched her friends die around her, had been stripped of her context, and was now working for her traditional enemy.The marine was tough, in more ways than one, and having someone on the team with no allegiance or ties to anyone on Earth was a real benefit.Especially after fucking Soren.She leaned back in her chair, unnerved by how different it felt when she weighed so little.Soren still smarted.Not the betrayal itself; betrayal was an occupational hazard.If she started getting her feelings hurt by that, she really should retire.No, it was that she hadnt seen it.Shed let herself have a blind spot, and Errinwright had known how to use it.How to disenfranchise her.She hated being outplayed.And more than that, she hated that her failure was going to mean more war, more violence, more children dying.That was the price for screwing up.More dead children.So she wouldnt screw up anymore.She could practically see Arjun, the gentle sorrow in his eyes.It isnt all your responsibility, he would say.Its everyones fucking responsibility, she said out loud.But Im the one whos taking it seriously.She smiled.Let Maos monitors and spies make sense of that.She let herself imagine them searching her room for some other transmission device, trying to find who shed been speaking to.Or theyd just think the old lady was losing her beans.Let em wonder.She closed out the Venus report.Another message had arrived while she was in her reverie, flagged as an issue shed requested follow up on.When she read the intelligence summary, her eyebrows rose.Im James Holden, and Im here to ask for your help.Avasarala watched Bobbie watching the screen.She looked exhausted and restless both.Her eyes werent bloodshot so much as dry looking.Like bearings without enough grease.If shed needed an example to demonstrate the difference between sleepy and tired, it would have been the marine.So he got out, then, Bobbie said.Him and his pet botanist and the whole damned crew, Avasarala said.So now we have one story about what they were doing on Ganymede that got your boys and ours so excited they started shooting each other.Bobbie looked up at her.Do you think its true?What is truth?Avasarala said.I think Holden has a long history of blabbing whatever he knows or thinks he knows all over creation.True or not, he believes it.And the part about the protomolecule?I mean, he just told everyone that the protomolecule is loose on Ganymede.He did.People have got to be reacting to that, right?Avasarala flipped to the intelligence summary, then to feeds of the riots on Ganymede.Thin, frightened people, exhausted by tragedy and war and fueled by panic.She could tell that the security forces arrayed against them were trying to be gentle.These werent thugs enjoying the use of force.These were orderlies trying to keep the frail and dying from hurting themselves and each other, walking the line between necessary violence and ineffectiveness.Fifty dead so far, Avasarala said.Thats the estimate, anyway.That place is so ass fucked right now, they might have been going to die of sickness and malnutrition anyway.But they died of this instead.I went to that restaurant, Bobbie said.Avasarala frowned, trying to make it into a metaphor for something.Bobbie pointed at the screen.The one theyre dying in front of?I ate there just after I arrived at the deployment.They had good sausage.Sorry, Avasarala said, but the marine only shook her head.So that cats out of the bag, she said.Maybe, Avasarala said.Maybe not.James Holden just told the whole system that the protomolecules on Ganymede.In what universe is that maybe not?Avasarala pulled up a mainstream newsfeed, checked the flags, and pulled the one with the listed experts she wanted.The data buffered for a few seconds while she lifted her finger for patience.totally irresponsible, a grave cheeked man in a lab coat and kufi cap said.The contempt in his voice could have peeled paint.The interviewer appeared beside him.She was maybe twenty years old, with hair cut short and straight and a dark suit that said she was a serious journalist.So youre saying the protomolecule isnt involved?It isnt.The images James Holden and his little group are sending have nothing to do with the protomolecule.That webbing is what happens when you have a binding agent leak.It happens all the time.So there isnt any reason to panic.Alice, the expert said, turning his condescension to the interviewer.Within a few days of exposure, Eros was a living horror show.In the time since hostilities opened, Ganymede hasnt shown one sign of a live infection.Not one.But he has a scientist with him.The botanist Dr.Praxidike Meng, whose daughter   I dont know this Meng fellow, but playing with a few soybeans makes him as much an expert on the protomolecule as it makes him a brain surgeon.Im very sorry, of course, about his missing daughter, but no.If the protomolecule were on Ganymede, wed have known long ago.This panic is over literally nothing.He can go on like that for hours, Avasarala said, shutting down the screen.And we have dozens like him.Mars is going to be doing the same thing.Saturating the newsfeeds with the counter story.Impressive, Bobbie said, pushing herself back from the desk.It keeps people calm.Thats the important thing.Holden thinks hes a hero, power to the people, information wants to be free blah blah blah, but hes a fucking moron.Hes on his own ship.Avasarala crossed her arms.Whats your point?Hes on his own ship and were not.So were all fucking morons, Avasarala said.Fine.Bobbie stood up and started pacing the room.She turned well before she reached the wall.The woman was used to pacing in smaller quarters.What do you want me to do about it?Bobbie asked.Nothing, Avasarala said.What the hell could you do about it?Youre stuck out here with me.I can hardly do anything, and Ive got friends in high places.Youve got nothing.I only wanted to talk to someone I didnt have to wait two minutes to let interrupt me.Shed taken it too far.Bobbies expression eased, went calm and closed and distant.She was shutting down.Avasarala lowered herself to the edge of the bed.That wasnt fair, Avasarala said.If you say so.I fucking say so.The marine tilted her head.Was that an apology?As close to one as Im giving right now.Something shifted in Avasaralas mind.Not about Venus, or James Holden and his poor lost girl appeal, or even Errinwright.It had to do with Bobbie and her pacing and her sleeplessness.Then she got it and laughed once mirthlessly.Bobbie crossed her arms, her steady silence a question.It isnt funny, Avasarala said.Try me.You remind me of my daughter.Yeah?Shed pissed Bobbie off, and now she was going to have to explain herself.The air recyclers hummed to themselves.Something far off in the bowels of the yacht groaned like they were on an ancient sailing ship made from timber and tar.My son died when he was fifteen, Avasarala said.Skiing.Did I tell you this?He was on a slope that hed run twenty, thirty times before.He knew it, but something happened and he ran into a tree.They guessed he was going something like sixty kilometers an hour when he hit.Some people survive an impact like that, but not him.For a moment, she was there again, in the house with the medic on the screen giving her the news.She could still smell the incense Arjun had been burning at the time.She could still hear the raindrops against the window, tapping like fingertips.It was the worst memory she had, and it was perfect and clear.She took a long, deep shuddering breath.I almost got divorced three times in the next six months.Arjun was a saint, but saints have their limits.We fought about anything.About nothing.Each of us blamed ourselves for not saving Charanpal, and we resented it when the other one tried to take some responsibility.And so, of course, my daughter suffered the worst.There was a night when we were out at something, Arjun and I.  We got home late, and wed been fighting.Ashanti was in the kitchen, washing dishes.Washing clean dishes by hand.Scrubbing them with a cloth and this terrible abrasive cleanser.Her fingers were bleeding, but she didnt seem to notice, you know?I tried to stop her, pull her away, but she started screaming and she wouldnt be quiet again until I let her resume her washing.I was so angry I couldnt see.I hated my daughter.For that moment, I hated her.And I remind you of her how exactly?Avasarala gestured to the room.Its bed with real linen sheets.The textured paper on the walls, the scented air.You cant compromise.You cant see things the way I tell you that they are, and when I try and make you, you go away.Is that what you want?Bobbie said.Her voice was crawling up to a higher energy level.It was anger, but it brought her back to being present.You want me to agree with whatever you say, and if I dont, youre going to hate me for it?Of course I want you to call me on my bullshit.Thats what I pay you for.Im only going to hate you for the moment, Avasarala said.I love my daughter very much.Im sure you do, maam.Im not her.Avasarala sighed.I didnt call you in here and show you all of this because I was tired of the lag.Im worried.Fuck it, Im scared.About what?You want a list?Bobbie actually smiled.Avasarala felt herself smiling back.Im scared that Ive been outplayed already, she said.Im afraid that I wont be able to stop the hawks and their cabal from using their pretty new toys.And and Im afraid that I might be wrong.What happens, Bobbie?What happens if whatever the hell that is on Venus rises up and finds us as divided and screwed up and ineffective as we are right now?I dont know.Avasaralas terminal chimed.She glanced at the new message.A note from Admiral Souther.Avasarala had sent him an utterly innocuous note about having lunch when they both got back to Earth, then coded it for high security clearance with a private encryption schema.It would take her handlers a couple of hours at least to crack it.She tabbed it open.The reply was plain text.LOVE TO.THE EAGLE LANDS AT MIDNIGHT PETTING ZOOS ARE ILLEGAL IN ROME.Avasarala laughed.It was real pleasure this time.Bobbie loomed up over her shoulder, and Avasarala turned the screen so that the big marine could peer down at it.Whats that mean?Avasarala motioned her down close enough that her lips were almost against Bobbies ear.At that intimate distance, the big woman smelled of clean sweat and the cucumber scented emollient that was in all Maos guest quarters.Nothing, Avasarala whispered.Hes just following my lead, but theyll chew their livers out guessing at it.Bobbie stood up.Her expression of incredulity was eloquent.This really is how government works, isnt it?Welcome to the monkey house, Avasarala said.I think I might go get drunk.And Ill get back to work.At the doorway, Bobbie paused.She looked small in the wide frame.A doorframe on a spaceship that left Roberta Draper looking small.There was nothing about the yacht that wasnt tastefully obscene.What happened with her?Who?Your daughter.Avasarala closed her terminal.Arjun sang to her until she stopped.It took about three hours.He sat on the counter and went through all the songs wed sung to them when they were little.Eventually, Ashanti let him lead her to her room and tuck her into bed.You hated him too, didnt you?For being able to help her when you couldnt.Youre catching on, Sergeant.Bobbie licked her lips.I want to hurt someone, she said.Im afraid if its not them, its going to wind up being me.We all grieve in our own ways, Avasarala said.For what its worth, youll never kill enough people to keep your platoon from dying.No more than I can save enough people that one of them will be Charanpal.For a long moment, Bobbie weighed the words.Avasarala could almost hear the womans mind turning the ideas one way and then another.Soren had been an idiot to underestimate this woman.But Soren had been an idiot in a lot of ways.When at length she spoke, her voice was light and conversational, as if her words werent profound.No harm trying, though.Its what we do, Avasarala said.The marine nodded curtly.For a moment, Avasarala thought she might be going to salute, but instead, she lumbered out toward the complimentary bar in the wide common area.There was a fountain out there with sprays of water drifting down fake bronze sculptures of horses and underdressed women.If that didnt make someone want a stiff drink of something, then nothing would.Avasarala thumbed on the video feed again.This is James Holden   She turned it off again.At least you lost that fucking beard, she said to no one.Thirty Six: Prax  Prax remembered his first epiphany.Or possibly, he thought, the one he remembered as his first.In the absence of further evidence, he went with it.Hed been in second form, just seventeen, and in the middle of a genetic engineering lab.Sitting there among the steel tables and microcentrifuges, hed struggled with why exactly his results were so badly off.Hed rechecked his calculations, read through his lab notes.The error was more than sloppy technique could explain, and his technique wasnt even sloppy.And then hed noticed that one of the reagents was chiral, and he knew what had happened.He hadnt figured anything wrong but he had assumed that the reagent was taken from a natural source rather than generated de novo.Instead of being uniformly left handed, it had been a mix of chiralities, half of them inactive.The insight had left him grinning from ear to ear.It had been a failure, but it was a failure he understood, and that made it a victory.The only thing he regretted was that seeing what should have been clear had taken him so long.The four days since he had sent the broadcast, hed hardly slept.Instead, hed read through the comments and messages pouring in with the donations, responding to a few, asking questions of people all over the system whom he didnt know.The goodwill and generosity pouring out to him was intoxicating.For two days, he hadnt slept, borne up on the euphoria of feeling effective.When he had slept, hed dreamed of finding Mei.When the answer came, he only wished hed found it before.The time they had, they could have taken her anywhere, Doc, Amos said.I mean, not to bust your balls or nothing.They could, Prax said.They could take her anywhere as long as they had a supply of her medications.But shes not the limiting factor.The question is where they were coming from.Prax had called the meeting without a clear idea of where to have it.The crew of the Roci was small, but Amos rooms were smaller.Hed considered the galley of the ship, but there were still technicians finishing the repairs, and Prax wanted privacy.In the end, hed checked the incoming stream of contributions from Holdens broadcast and taken enough to rent a room from a station club.Now they were in a private lounge.Outside the wall screen window, the great construction waldoes shifted by tiny degrees, attitude rockets flaring and going still in patterns as complex as language.Another thing Prax had never thought about before coming here: The station waldoes had to fire attitude rockets to keep their movements from shifting the station they were attached to.Everything, everywhere, a dance of tiny movements and the ripples they made.Inside the room, the music that floated between the wide tables and crash gel chairs was soft and lyrical, the singers voice deep and soothing.From?Alex said.I thought they were from Ganymede.The lab on Ganymede wasnt equipped to deal with serious research, Prax said.And they arranged things so that Ganymede would turn into a war zone.Thatd be a bad idea if they were doing their primary work in the middle of it.That was a field lab.I try not to shit where I eat, Amos said, agreeing.You live on a spaceship, Holden said.I dont shit in the galley, though.Fair point.Anyway, Prax said, we can safely assume they were working from a better protected base.And that base has to be somewhere in the Jovian system.Somewhere nearby.You lost me again, Holden said.Why does it need to be close?Transport time.Mei can go anywhere if theres a good supply of medications, but shes more robust than the the things.Holden raised his hand like a schoolboy asking a question.Okay, I could be hearing you wrong, but did you just say that the thing that ripped its way into my ship, threw a five hundred kilo storage pallet at me, and almost chewed a path straight to the reactor core is more delicate than a four year old girl with no immune system?Prax nodded.A stab of horror and grief went through him.She wasnt four anymore.Meis birthday had been the month before, and hed missed it.She was five.But grief and horror were old companions by now.He pushed the thought aside.Ill be clearer, he said.Meis body isnt fighting its situation.Thats her disease, if you think about it.Theres a whole array of things that happen in normal bodies that dont happen in hers.Now you take one of the things, one of the creatures.Like the one from the ship?That bastard was pretty active, Amos said.No, Prax said.I mean, yes, but no.I mean active on a biochemical level.If Strickland or Merrian or whoever is using the protomolecule to reengineer a human body, theyre taking one complex system and overlaying another one.We know its unstable.Okay, Naomi said.She was sitting beside Amos and across the table from Holden.How do we know that?Prax frowned.When hed practiced making the presentation, he hadnt expected so many questions.The things hed thought were obvious from the start hadnt even occurred to the others.This was why he hadnt gone in for teaching.Looking at their faces now, he saw blank confusion.All right, he said.Let me take it from the top.There was something on Ganymede that started the war.There was also a secret lab staffed with people who at the very least knew about the attack before it happened.Check, Alex said.Okay, Prax said.In the lab, we had signs of the protomolecule, a dead boy, and a bunch of people getting ready to leave.And when we got there, we only had to fight halfway in.After that, something else was going ahead of us and killing everyone.Hey!Amos said.You think that was the same fucker that got into the Roci?Prax stopped the word obviously just before it fell from his lips.Probably, he said instead.And it seems likely that the original attack involved more like that one.So two got loose?Naomi asked, but he could see that she already sensed the problem with that.No, because they knew it was going to happen.One got loose when Amos threw that grenade back at them.One was released intentionally.But that doesnt matter.What matters is that theyre using the protomolecule to remake human bodies, and they arent able to control it with perfect fidelity.The programming theyre putting in fails.Prax nodded, as if by doing it he could will them to follow his chain of reasoning.Holden shook his head, paused, and then nodded.The bomb, he said.The bomb, Prax agreed.Even when they didnt know that the second thing was going to get loose, theyd outfitted it with a powerful incendiary explosive device.Ah!Alex said.I get it!You figure they knew it was going to go off the rails eventually, so they wired it to blow if it got out of hand.In the depths of space, a construction welder streaked across the hull of the half built ship, the light of its flare casting a sudden, sharp light across the pilots eager face.Yes, Prax said.But it could be also be an ancillary weapon, or a payload that the thing was supposed to deliver.I think its a fail safe.It probably is, but it could be any number of other things.Okay, but it left it behind, Alex said.Given time, it ejected the bomb, Prax said.You see?It chose to reconfigure itself to remove the payload.It didnt place it to destroy the Roci, even though it could have.It didnt deliver it to a preset target.It just decided to pop it loose.And it knew to do that   Its smart enough to recognize threat, Prax said.I dont know the mechanism yet.It could be cognitive or networked or some kind of modified immune response.Okay, Prax.So if the protomolecule can eventually get out of whatever constraints theyre putting on it and go rogue, where does that get us?Naomi asked.Square one, Prax thought, and launched in on the information hed intended to give them in the first place.It means that wherever the main lab is the place they didnt release one of those things on it has to be close enough to Ganymede to get it there before it slipped its leash.I dont know how long that is, and Im betting they dont either.So closer is better.A Jovian moon or a secret station, Holden said.You cant have a secret station in the Jovian system, Alex said.Theres too much traffic.Someoned see something.Shit, its where most of the extrasolar astronomy was going on until we got out to Uranus.Put something close, the observatories are gonna get pissed because its stinking up their pictures, right?Naomi tapped her fingers against the tabletop, the sound like the ticking of condensate falling inside sheet metal vents.Well, the obvious choice is Europa, she said.Its Io, Prax said, impatience slipping into his voice.I used some of the money to get a tariff search on the kinds of arylamines and nitroarenes that you use for mutagentic research.He paused.Its all right that I did that, isnt it?Spent the money?Thats what its there for, Holden said.Okay, so mutagens that only start functioning after you activate them are very tightly controlled, since you can use them for bioweapons research, but if youre trying to work with that kind of biological cascade and constraint systems, youd need them.Most of the supplies went to Ganymede, but there was a steady stream to Europa too.And when I looked at that, I couldnt find a final receiver listed.Because they shipped back out of Europa about two hours after they landed.Bound for Io, Holden said.It didnt list a location, but the shipping containers for them have to follow Earth and Mars safety specifications.Very expensive.And the shipping containers for the Europa shipment were returned to the manufacturer for credit on a transport bound from Io.Prax took a breath.It had been like pulling teeth, but he was pretty sure hed made all the points he needed to for the evidence to be, if not conclusive, at least powerfully suggestive.So, Amos said, drawing the word out to almost three syllables.The bad guys are probably on Io?Yes, Prax said.Well shit, Doc.Coulda just said so.The thrust gravity was a full g but without the subtle Coriolis of Tycho Station.Prax sat in his bunk, bent over his hand terminal.There had been times on the journey to Tycho Station when being half starved and sick at heart were the only things that distracted him.Nothing physical had changed.The walls were still narrow and close.The air recycler still clicked and hummed.Only now, rather than feeling isolated, Prax felt he was in the center of a vast network of people, all bent toward the same end that he was.MR.MENG, I SAW THE REPORT ON YOU AND MY HEART AND PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.IM SORRY I CANT SEND MONEY BECAUSE IM ON BASIC, BUT I HAVE INCLUDED THE REPORT IN MY CHURCH NEWSLETTER.I HOPE YOU CAN FIND YOUR DAUGHTER SAFE AND HEALTHY.Prax had composed a form letter for responding to all the general well wishers, and hed considered trying to find a filter that could identify those messages and reply automatically with the canned response.He held off because he wasnt sure how well he could define the conditions set, and he didnt want anyone to feel that their sentiments were being taken for granted.And after all, he had no duties on the Rocinante.IM WRITING YOU BECAUSE I MAY HAVE INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP WITH THE QUEST TO RECLAIM YOUR DAUGHTER.SINCE I WAS VERY YOUNG, I HAVE HAD POWERFUL PREMONITIONS IN MY DREAMS, AND THREE DAYS BEFORE I SAW JAMES HOLDENS ARTICLE ABOUT YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER, I SAW HER IN A DREAM.SHE WAS ON LUNA IN A VERY SMALL PLACE WITHOUT LIGHT, AND SHE WAS SCARED.I TRIED TO COMFORT HER, BUT I FEEL SURE NOW THAT YOU ARE MEANT TO FIND HER ON LUNA OR IN A NEARBY ORBIT.Prax didnt respond to everything, of course.The journey to Io wouldnt take much more time than the one to Tycho had.Probably less, since they were unlikely to have the chaos of a stowaway protomolecule construct blowing out the cargo bay this time.If Prax thought about it too long, it made his palm itch.He knew where she was or where she had been.Every hour was bringing him closer, and every message flowing into his charitable account gave him a little more power.Someone else who might know where Carlos Merrian was and what he was doing.There were a few hed set up conversations with, mostly video conversations sent back and forth.Hed spoken with a security broker based out of Ceres Station, whod run some of his tariff searches and seemed like a genuinely nice man.Hed exchanged a few video recordings with a grief counselor on Mars before he started to get an uncomfortable feeling that she was hitting on him.An entire school of children at least a hundred of them had sent him a recording of them singing a song in mixed Spanish and French in honor of Mei and her return.Intellectually, he knew that nothing had changed.The chances were still very good that Mei was dead, or at least that he would never see her again.But to have so many people and in such a steady stream telling him that it would be all right, that they hoped it would be all right, that they were pulling for him made despair less possible.It was probably something like group reinforcement effect.It was something common to some species of crop plant: An ill or suffering plant could be moved into a community of well members of the species and, through proximity, improve, even if soil and water were supplied separately.Yes, it was chemically mediated, but humans were social animals, and a woman smiling up from the screen, her eyes seeming to look deeply into your own, and saying what you wanted to believe was almost impossible to wholly disbelieve.It was selfish, and he knew that, but it was also addictive.Hed stopped paying attention to the donations that were coming in once he knew there was enough to fund the ship as far as Io.Holden had given him an expense report and a detailed spreadsheet of costs, but Prax didnt think Holden would cheat him, so hed barely glanced at anything other than the total at the bottom.Once there was enough money, hed stopped caring about money.It was the commentary that took his time and attention.He heard Alex and Amos in the galley, their voices calm and conversational.It reminded him of living in the group housing at university.The awareness of other voices, other presences, and the comfort that came from those familiar sounds.It wasnt that different from reading the comment threads.I LOST MY SON FOUR YEARS AGO, AND I STILL CANT IMAGINE WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.I WISH THERE WAS MORE I COULD DO.He had the list down to only a few dozen.It was mid afternoon in the arbitrary world of ship time, but he was powerfully sleepy.He debated leaving the remaining messages until after a nap, and decided to read through them without requiring himself to respond to each one.Alex laughed.Amos joined him.Prax opened the fifth message.YOU ARE A SICK, SICK, SICK MOTHERFUCKER, AND IF I EVER SEE YOU, I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL KILL YOU MYSELF.PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD BE RAPED TO DEATH JUST SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.Prax tried to catch his breath.The sudden ache in his body was just like the aftermath of being punched in the solar plexus.He deleted the message.Another came in, and then three more.And then a dozen.With a sense of dread, Prax opened one of the new ones.I HOPE YOU DIE.I dont understand, Prax said to the terminal.The vitriol was sudden and constant and utterly inexplicable.At least, it was until he opened one of the messages that had the link to a public newsfeed.Prax put in a request, and five minutes later, his screen went blank, the logo of one of the big Earth based news aggregators glowed briefly in blue, and the title of the feed series The Raw Feed appeared.When the logo faded out, Nicola was looking out at him.Prax reached for the controls, part of his mind insisting that hed somehow slipped into his private messages, even as the rest of him knew better.Nicola licked her lips, looked away, then back at the camera.She looked tired.Exhausted.My names Nicola Mulko.I used to be married to Praxidike Meng, the man who put out a call for help finding our daughter my daughter, Mei.A tear dripped down her cheek, and she didnt wipe it away.What you dont know what no one knows is that Praxidike Meng is a monster of a human being.Ever since I got away from him, Ive been trying to get Mei back.I thought his abuse of me was between us.I didnt think hed hurt her.But information has come back to me from friends who stayed on Ganymede after I left that  Nicola, Prax said.Dont.Dont do this.Praxidike Meng is a violent and dangerous man, Nicola said.As Meis mother, I believe that she has been emotionally, physically, and sexually abused by him since I left.And that her alleged disappearance during the troubles on Ganymede are to hide the fact that hes finally killed her.The tears were flowing freely down Nicolas cheeks now, but her voice and eyes were dead as last weeks fish.I dont blame anyone but myself, she said.I should never have left when I couldnt get my little girl away too     Thirty Seven: Avasarala  I dont blame anyone but myself, the teary eyed woman said, and Avasarala stopped the feed, sitting back in her chair.Her heart was beating faster than usual and she could feel thoughts swimming just under the ice of her conscious mind.She felt like someone could press an ear to her skull and listen to her brain humming.Bobbie was sitting on the four poster.She made the thing look small, which was impressive in itself.She had one leg tucked up under her and a pack of real playing cards laid out in formation on the crisp gold and green bedspread.The game of solitaire was forgotten, though.The Martians gaze was on her, and Avasarala felt a slow grin pulling at her lips.Well, Ill be fucked, she said.Theyre scared of him.Whos scared of who?Errinwright is moving against Holden and this Meng bastard, whoever he is.They actually forced him to take action.I couldnt get that out of him.You dont think the botanist was diddling his kid?Might have been, but that she tapped on the still, tearful face of the botanists ex wife is a smear campaign.Ill bet you a weeks pay that Ive had lunch with the woman coordinating it.Bobbies skeptical look only made Avasarala smile more broadly.This, Avasarala said, is the first genuinely good thing thats happened since we got on this floating whorehouse.Ive got to get to work.Goddamn, but I wish I was back at the office.You want some tea?Gin, she said, engaging the camera on her terminal.Were celebrating.In the focus window, she looked smaller than she felt.The rooms had been designed to command attention whatever angle she put herself in, like being trapped in a postcard.Anyone who rode in the yacht would be able to brag without saying a word, but in the weak gravity her hair stood out from her head like shed just gotten out of bed.More than that, she looked emotionally exhausted and physically diminished.Put it away, she told herself.Find the mask.She took a deep breath, made a rude gesture into the camera, and then started recording.Admiral Souther, she said.Thank you so much for your last message.Somethings come to my attention that I thought you might find interesting.It looks like someones taken a fresh dislike to James Holden.If I were with the fleet instead of floating around the fucking solar system, Id take you out for a cup of coffee and talk this over, but since thats not happening, Im going to open some of my private files for you.Ive been following Holden.Take a look at what Ive got and tell me if youre seeing the same things I am.She sent the message.The next thing that would have made sense would be contacting Errinwright.If the situation had been what they were both pretending it was, shed have kept him involved and engaged.For a long moment, she considered following the form, pretending.Bobbie loomed up on her right, putting the glass of gin on the desk with a soft click.Avasarala picked it up and sipped a small taste of it.Maos private label gin was excellent, even without the lime twist.Nah.Fuck Errinwright.She pulled up her address book and started leafing through entries until she found what she wanted and pressed record.Ms.Corlinowski, Ive just seen the leaked video accusing Praxidike Meng of screwing his cute little five year old daughter.When exactly did UN media relations turn into a fucking divorce court?If it gets out that we were behind that, I would like to know whose resignation Im going to hand to the newsfeeds, and right now Im thinking its yours.Give my love to Richard, and get back to me before I fire your incompetent ass out of spite.She ended the recording and sent it.She was the one that arranged it?Bobbie asked.Might have been, Avasarala said, taking another bite of gin.It was too good.If she wasnt careful, shed drink a lot of it.If it wasnt, shell find who it was and serve them up on a plate.Emma Corlinowskis a coward.Its why I love her.Over the next hour, she sent a dozen more messages out, performance after performance after performance.She started a liability investigation into Mengs ex wife and whether the UN could be held responsible for slander.She put the Ganymede relief coordinator on high alert, demanding everything she could get about Mei Meng and the search for her.She put in high priority requests to have the doctor and the woman from Holdens broadcast identified, and then sent a twenty minute rambling message to an old colleague in data storage, with a small, tacit request for the same information made in the middle of it all.Errinwright had changed the game.If shed had freedom, shed have been unstoppable.As it was, she had to assume that every move she made would be cataloged and acted against almost as soon as she made it.But Errinwright and his allies were only human, and if she kept a solid flow of demands and requests, screeds and wheedling, they might overlook something.Or someone on a newsfeed might notice the uptick in activity and look into it.Or, if nothing else, her efforts might give Errinwright a bad nights sleep.It was what she had.It wasnt enough.Long years of practice with the fine dance of politics and power had left her with expectations and reflexes that couldnt find their right form there.The lag was killing her with frustration, and she took it out on whomever she was recording for at the moment.She felt like a world class musician standing before a full auditorium and handed a kazoo.She didnt notice when she finished her gin.She only put the glass to her mouth, found it empty, and realized it wasnt the first time shed done it.Five hours had passed.Shed had only three responses so far out of almost fifty messages shed sent out.That was more than lag.That was someone elses damage control.She didnt realize that she was hungry until Cotyar came with a plate, the smell of curried lamb and watermelon wafting in with him.Avasaralas belly woke with a roar, and she turned off her terminal.Youve just saved my life, she told him, gesturing at the desk.It was Sergeant Drapers idea, he said.After the third time you ignored her asking.I dont remember that, she said as he put the dish in front of her.Dont they have servants on this thing?Why are you bringing the food?They do, maam.Im not letting them in here.That seems extreme.Feeling jumpy, are you?As you say.She ate too quickly.Her back was aching, and her left leg was tingling with the pins and needles she got now from sitting too long in one position.As a young woman, shed never suffered that.On the other hand, she hadnt had the ability to pepper every major player in the United Nations and be taken seriously.Time took her strength but it gave her power in exchange.It was a fair trade.She couldnt wait to finish her meal, turning on the terminal while she gulped the last of it down.Four waiting messages.Souther, God bless his shriveled little heart.One from someone at the legal council whose name she didnt recognize, and another from someone she did.One from Michael Jon, which was probably about Venus.She opened the one from Souther.The admiral appeared on her screen and she had to stop herself from saying hello.It was only a video recording, not a real conversation.She hated it.Chrisjen, the admiral said.Youre going to have to be careful with all this information youre sending me.Arjuns going to get jealous.I wasnt aware of our friend Jimmys part in instigating this latest brouhaha.Our friend Jimmy.He wasnt saying the name Holden out loud.That was interesting.He was expecting some kind of filtering to be sniffing out Holdens name.She tried to guess whether he thought the filter would be on his outgoing messages or her incoming.If Errinwright had half a brain which he did hed be watching the traffic both ways for both of them.Was he worried about someone else?How many players were there at the table?She didnt have enough information to work with, but it was interesting, at least.I can see where your concerns might lead you, Souther said.Im making some inquiries, but you know how these things are.Might find something in a minute, might find something in a year.You dont be a stranger, though.Theres more than enough going on out here that I can wish I could take you up on that lunch.Were all looking forward to seeing you again.There was a barefaced lie, Avasarala thought.Still, nice of him to say it.She scraped her fork along the bottom of the plate, a thin residue of curry clinging to the silver.The first message was some young man with a Brazilian accent explaining to her that the UN had nothing to do with the video footage released of Nicola Mulko, and therefore could not be held responsible for it.The second was the boys supervisor, apologizing for him and promising a fully formed brief by the end of the day, which was considerably more like it.The smart people were still afraid of her.That thought was more nourishing than the lamb.As she reached for the screen, the ship shifted under her, gravity pulling her slightly to the side.She put her hand on the desk; the curry and the remnants of gin churned her gut.Were we expecting that?she shouted.Yes, maam, Cotyar called from the next room.Scheduled course correction.Never happens at the fucking office, she said, and Michael Jon appeared on her screen.He looked mildly confused, but that could have been just the angle of his face.She felt a sick dread.For a moment, the Arboghast floated before her again, coming apart.Without intending it, she paused the feed.Something in the back of her mind wanted to turn away.Not to know.It wasnt hard to understand how Errinwright and Nguyen and their cabal would turn their backs on Venus, on the alien chaos that was becoming order and more than order.She felt it too, the atavistic fear lurking at the back of her mind.How much easier to turn to the old games, the old patterns, the history of warfare and conflict, deception and death.For all its horror, it was familiar.It was known.As a girl, shed seen a film about a man who saw the face of God.For the first hour of the film, he had gone through the drab life of someone living on basic on the coast of southern Africa.When he saw God, the film switched to ten minutes of the man wailing and then another hour of slowly building himself back up to do the same idiot life hed had at the beginning.Avasarala had hated it.Now, though, she almost understood.Turning away was natural.Even if it was moronic and self destructive and empty, it was natural.War.Slaughter.Death.All the violence that Errinwright and his men and she felt certain they were almost all of them men were embracing, they were drawn to because it was comforting.And they were scared.Well, so was she.Pussies, she said, and restarted the playback.Venus can think, Michael Jon said instead of hello or any other social pleasantry.Ive had the signal analysis team running the data we saw from the network of water and electrical currents, and weve found a model.Its only about a sixty percent correlation, but Im comfortable putting that above chance.Its got different anatomy, of course, but its functional structure is most like a cetacean doing spatial reasoning problems.I mean, theres still the problem of the explanatory gap, and I cant help with that part, but with what weve seen, Im fairly sure that the patterns we saw were it thinking.They were the actual thoughts, like neurons firing off.He looked into the camera as if expecting her to answer and then looked mildly disappointed when she didnt.I thought youd want to know, he said, and ended the recording.Before she could formulate a response, a new message from Souther appeared.She opened it with a sense of gratitude and relief that she was slightly ashamed of.Chrisjen, he said.We have a problem.You should check the force assignments on Ganymede and let me know if were seeing the same things.Avasarala frowned.The lag now was over twenty eight minutes.She put in a standard request, expedited it, and stood up.Her back was a solid knot.She walked to the common area of the suite.Bobbie, Cotyar, and three other men were sitting in a circle, the deck of cards distributed among them.Poker.Avasarala walked toward them, rolling through the hips where movement hurt.Something about lower gravity made her joints ache.She lowered herself to Bobbies side.Next hand, you can deal me in, she said.The order had come from Nguyen, and at first glance it made no sense at all.Six UN destroyers had been ordered off the Ganymede patrol, sent out at high burn on a course that seemed to lead essentially to nowhere.Initial reports showed that after a decent period of wondering what the fuck, a similar detachment of Martian ships matched course.Nguyen was up to something, and she didnt have the first clue what it could be.But Souther had sent it and thought she would see something.It took another hour to find it.Holdens Rocinante had departed Tycho Station on a gentle burn for the Jovian system.He might have filed a flight plan with the OPA, but he hadnt informed Earth or Mars of anything, which meant Nguyen was watching him too.They werent just scared.They were going to kill him.Avasarala sat quietly for a long moment before she stood up and went back toward the game.Cotyar and Bobbie were at the end of a high stakes round, which meant the pile of little bits of chocolate candy they were using for chips was almost five centimeters deep.Mr.Cotyar, Avasarala said.Sergeant Draper.With me, please.The cards all vanished.The men looked at each other nervously as she walked back into her bedroom.She closed the door behind them carefully.It didnt even click.I am about to do something that may pull a trigger, she said.If I do this, the complexion of our situation may change.Cotyar and Bobbie exchanged looks.I have some things Id like to get out of storage, Bobbie said.Ill brief the men, Cotyar said.Ten minutes.The lag between the Guanshiyin and the Rocinante was still too long for conversation, but it was less than it took to get a message back to Earth.The sense of being so far from home left her a little light headed.Cotyar stepped into the room and nodded once.Avasarala opened her terminal and requested a tightbeam connection.She gave the transponder code for the Rocinante.Less than a minute later, the connection came back refused.She smiled to herself and opened a channel to ops.This is Assistant Undersecretary Avasarala, she said, as if there were anyone else on board who it might be.What the fuck is wrong with your tightbeam?I apologize, Madam Secretary, a young man with bright blue eyes and close cut blond hair said.That communication channel isnt available right now.Why the fuck isnt it available?Its not available, maam.Fine.I didnt want to do this on the radio, but I can broadcast if I have to.Im afraid that wont be possible, the boy said.Avasarala took a long breath and let it out through her teeth.Put the captain on, she said.A moment later, the image jumped.The captain was a thin faced man with the brown eyes of an Irish setter.The set of his mouth and his bloodless lips told her that he knew what was coming, at least in outline.For a moment, she just looked into the camera.It was a trick shed learned when shed just started off.Looking at the screen image let the other person feel they were being seen.Looking into the tiny black pinpoint of the lens itself left them feeling stared down.Captain.I have a high priority message I need to send.I am very sorry.Were having technical difficulties with the communication array.Do you have a backup system?A shuttle we can power up?Anything?Not at this time.Youre lying to me, she said.Then, when he didnt answer: I am making an official request that this yacht engage its emergency beacon and change course to the nearest aid.Im not going to be able to do that, maam.If you will just be patient, well get you to Ganymede safe and in one piece.Im sure any repairs we need can be done there.Avasarala leaned close to the terminal.I can come up there and we can have this conversation personally, she said.Captain.You know the laws as well as I do.Turn on the beacon or give me communications access.Maam, you are the guest of Jules Pierre Mao, and I respect that.But Mr.Mao is the owner of this vessel, and I answer to him.No, then.Im very sorry.Youre making a mistake, shithead, Avasarala said, and dropped the connection.Bobbie came into the room.Her face was bright, and there was a hunger about her, like a running dog straining at the leash.Gravity shifted a degree.A course correction, but not a change.Howd it go?Bobbie asked.I am declaring this vessel in violation of laws and standards, Avasarala said.Cotyar, youre witness to that.As you say, maam.All right, then.Bobbie.Get me control of this fucking ship.Thirty Eight: Bobbie  What else do you need from us?Cotyar asked.Two of his people were moving the big crate marked FORMAL WEAR into Avasaralas room.They were using a large furniture dolly and grunting with effort.Even in the gentle quarter g of the Guanshiyins thrust, Bobbies armor weighed over a hundred kilos.Were sure this room isnt under surveillance?Bobbie said.This is going to work a lot better if they have no idea whats about to happen.Cotyar shrugged.It has no functioning eavesdropping devices Ive been able to detect.Okay, then, Bobbie said, rapping on the fiberglass crate with her knuckle.Open it up.Cotyar tapped something on his hand terminal and the crates locks opened with a sharp click.Bobbie yanked the opened panel off and leaned it against the wall.Inside the crate, suspended in a web of elastic bands, was her suit.Cotyar whistled.A Goliath III.I cant believe they let you keep it.Bobbie removed the helmet and put it on the bed, then began pulling the various other pieces out of the webbing and setting them on the floor.They gave it to your tech guys to verify some video stored in the suit.When Avasarala tracked it down, it was in a closet, collecting dust.No one seemed to care when she took it.She pulled out the suits right arm.She hadnt expected them to get her any of the 2mm ammo the suits integrated gun used, but was surprised to find that theyd completely removed the gun from the housing.It made sense to remove all the weapons before handing the suit off to a bunch of civilians, but it still annoyed her.Shit, she said.Wont be shooting anyone, I guess.If you did, Cotyar said with a smile, would the bullets even slow down as they went through both of the ships hulls and let all the air out?Nope, Bobbie said, laying the last piece of the suit on the floor, then pulling out the tools necessary to put it all back together again.But that might be a point in my favor.The gun on this rig is designed to shoot through other people wearing comparable armor.Anything that will shoot through my suit here will probably also hole the ship.Which means    None of the security personnel on this vessel will have weapons capable of penetrating your armor, Cotyar finished.As you say.How many of my people will you want with you?None, Bobbie said, attaching the fresh battery pack Avasaralas techs had provided to the back of the armor and getting a lovely green fully charged light from the panel.Once I get started, the obvious counterplay will be to grab the undersecretary and hold her hostage.Preventing that is your job.Cotyar smiled again.There was no humor in it.As you say.It took Bobbie just under three hours to assemble and field prep her suit.It should have taken only two, but she forgave herself the extra hour by remembering that she was out of practice.The closer the suit got to completion, the tighter the knot in her stomach grew.Some of it was the natural tension that came before combat.And her time in the Marines had taught her to use it.To let the stress force her to recheck everything three times.Once she was in the thick of it, it would be too late.But deep down, Bobbie knew that the possibility of violence wasnt the only thing twisting up her insides.It was impossible to forget what had happened the last time shed worn this suit.The red enamel of her Martian camouflage was pitted and scraped from the exploding monster and her high speed skid across Ganymedes ice.A tiny bit of fluid leakage on the knee reminded her of Private Hillman.Hilly, her friend.Wiping off the helmets faceplate made her think of the last time shed spoken to Lieutenant Givens, her CO, just before the monster had ripped him in two.When the suit was finished and lying on the floor, opened up and waiting for her to climb inside, she felt a shudder run up her spine.For the first time ever, the inside looked small.Sepulchral.No, she said to no one but herself.No?Cotyar asked, sitting on the floor next to her, holding the tools he thought she might need next.Hed been so quiet during the assembly procedure shed sort of forgotten he was there.Im not afraid of putting this back on, she said.Ah, Cotyar replied with a nod, then put the tools into the toolbox.As you say.Bobbie pushed herself to her feet and yanked the black unitard she wore under the armor out of the crate.Without thinking about it, she stripped down to her panties and pulled the skintight garment on.She was pulling the wire leads out of her armor and connecting them to the various sensors on the bodysuit when she noticed that Cotyar had turned his back to her, and that his usually light brown neck was turning beet red.Oh, she said.Sorry.Ive stripped down and put this on in front of my squaddies so many times I dont even think about it anymore.No reason to apologize, Cotyar said without turning around.I was only taken by surprise.He risked a peek over his left shoulder, and when he saw that she was fully covered by the bodysuit, he turned back to help her wire it up to the armor.You are, he said, then paused for a beat.Lovely.It was her turn to blush.Arent you married?Bobbie asked with a grin, happy for the distraction.The simple humanity in discomfort with mating signals made the monster in her head seem very far away.Yes, Cotyar replied, attaching the final lead to a sensor at the small of her back.Very.But Im not blind.Thank you, Bobbie said, and gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder.After a few moments struggle with the tight spaces, she sat down into the suits open chest and slid down until her legs and arms were fully inside.Button me up.Cotyar sealed up the chest as shed shown him, then put the helmet on her and locked it in place.Inside the suit, her HUD flashed through the boot routine.A gentle, almost subliminal hum surrounded her.She activated the array of micro motors and pumps that powered the exo musculature, and then sat up.Cotyar was looking at her, his face a question.Bobbie turned on the external speaker and said, Yeah, it all looks good in here.Green across the board.She pushed herself to her feet effortlessly and felt the old sensation of barely restrained power running through her limbs.She knew if she pushed off hard with her legs, shed hit the ceiling with enough force to severely damage it.A sudden motion of her arm could hurl the heavy four poster bed across the room or shatter Cotyars spine.It made her move with the deliberate gentleness of long training.Cotyar reached under his jacket and pulled out a sleek black pistol of the slug throwing variety.Bobbie knew the security team had loaded them with high impact plastic rounds, guaranteed not to knock holes in the ship.It was the same kind of round Maos security team would be using.He started to hold it out to her, but then looked at the thickness of her armored fingers, and at the much smaller opening of the trigger guard, and shrugged apologetically.I wont need it, she said.Her voice sounded harsh, metallic, inhuman.Cotyar smiled again.As you say.Bobbie punched the button to call the keel elevator, then walked back and forth in the lounge, letting her reflexes get used to her armor.There was a nanosecond delay between attempting to move a limb and having the armor react.It made walking around feel vaguely dreamlike, as if the act of wanting to move your limbs and the moving of the limbs themselves were separate events.Hours of training and use had mostly overcome the sensation when Bobbie wore her armor, but it always took a few minutes of moving around to get past the oddness of it.Avasarala walked into the lounge from the room they were using as the communications center and sat down at the bar.She poured herself a stiff shot of gin, then squeezed a piece of lime into it almost as an afterthought.The old lady had been drinking a lot more lately, but it wasnt Bobbies place to point it out.Maybe it was helping her sleep.When the elevator didnt arrive after several minutes, she thumped over to the panel and hit the button a few more times.A small display said OUT OF SERVICE.Damn, Bobbie said to herself.They really are kidnapping us.Shed left the external speakers on, and the harsh voice coming out of her suit echoed around the room.Avasarala didnt look up from her drink but said, Remember what I said.Huh?Bobbie said, not paying attention.She climbed awkwardly up the crew ladder to the deck hatch above her head and hit the button.The hatch slid open.That meant that everyone was still pretending that this wasnt a kidnapping.They could explain away the elevator.Explaining why the undersecretary was locked out of the rest of the ship would be harder.Maybe they figured a woman in her seventies would be reluctant to climb around the ship on ladders, so killing the lift was good enough.They might have been right.Avasarala certainly didnt look like she was up to a two hundred foot climb, even in the low gravity.None of these people were on Ganymede, Avasarala said.Okay, Bobbie replied to the seeming non sequitur.You wont be able to kill enough of them to bring your platoon back, Avasarala finished, tossing off the last of her gin, then pushing away from the bar and heading off to her room.Bobbie didnt reply.She pulled herself up to the next deck and let the hatch slide shut behind her.Her armor had been designed for exactly this sort of mission.The original Goliath class scout suits had been built for Marine boarding parties in ship to ship engagements.That meant they were designed for maximum maneuverability in tight spaces.No matter how good the armor was, it was useless if the soldier wearing it couldnt climb ladders, slip through human sized hatches, and maneuver gracefully in microgravity.Bobbie climbed the ladder to the next deck hatch and hit the button.The console responded with a red warning light.A few moments of looking at the menus revealed why: Theyd parked the crew elevator just above the hatch and then disabled it, creating a barricade.And that meant they knew something was up.Bobbie looked around the room she was in, another relaxation lounge, nearly identical to the one shed just left, until she found the likeliest place for them to have hidden their cameras.She waved.This wont stop me, guys.She climbed back down and went into the luxurious bathroom space.On a ship this nice, it couldnt properly be called the head.A few moments probing found the fairly well hidden bulkhead service hatch.It was locked.Bobbie tore it off the wall.On the other side were a tangle of piping and a narrow corridor barely large enough to stuff her armor into.She climbed in and pulled herself along the pipes for two decks, then kicked the service hatch into the room and climbed in.The compartment turned out to be a secondary galley, with a bank of stoves and ovens along one wall, several refrigeration units, and lots of counter space, all in gleaming stainless steel.
