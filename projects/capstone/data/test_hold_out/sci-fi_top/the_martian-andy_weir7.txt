After eight hours of dull, physically intense work, I had 137 holes to show for it.It turned out to be easy to deal with places I couldnt reach.I didnt need to modify a landing strut after all.I just had to get something to stand on.I used a geological sample container (also known as a box).Before I was in contact with NASA, I would have worked more than eight hours.I can stay out for ten before even dipping into emergency air.But NASAs got a lot of nervous Nellies who dont want me out longer than spec.With todays work, Im about one fourth of the way through the whole cut.At least, one fourth of the way through the drilling.Then Ill have 759 little chunks to chisel out.And Im not sure how well carbon composite is going to take to that.But NASAll do it a thousand times back on Earth and tell me the best way to get it done.Anyway, at this rate, itll take four more sols of (boring ass) work to finish the drilling.Ive actually exhausted Lewiss supply of shitty seventies TV.And Ive read all of Johanssens mystery books.Ive already rifled through other crewmates stuff to find entertainment.But all of Vogels stuff is in German, Beck brought nothing but medical journals, and Martinez didnt bring anything.I got really bored, so I decided to pick a theme song!Something appropriate.And naturally, it should be something from Lewiss godawful seventies collection.It wouldnt be right any other way.There are plenty of great candidates: Life on Mars?by David Bowie, Rocket Man by Elton John, Alone Again (Naturally) by Gilbert OSullivan.But I settled on Stayin Alive by the Bee Gees.LOG ENTRY: SOL 195  Another day, another bunch of holes: 145 this time (Im getting better).Im halfway done.This is getting really old.But at least I have encouraging messages from Venkat to cheer me on![17:12] Watney: 145 holes today.357 total.[17:31] JPL: We thought youd have more done by now.Dick.Anyway, Im still bored at night.I guess thats a good thing.Nothings wrong with the Hab.Theres a plan to save me, and the physical labor is making me sleep wonderfully.I miss tending the potatoes.The Hab isnt the same without them.Theres still soil everywhere.No point in lugging it back outside.Lacking anything better to do, I ran some tests on it.Amazingly, some of the bacteria survived.The population is strong and growing.Thats pretty impressive, when you consider it was exposed to near vacuum and subarctic temperatures for over twenty four hours.My guess is pockets of ice formed around some of the bacteria, leaving a bubble of survivable pressure inside, and the cold wasnt quite enough to kill them.With hundreds of millions of bacteria, it only takes one survivor to stave off extinction.Life is amazingly tenacious.They dont want to die any more than I do.LOG ENTRY: SOL 196  I fucked up.I fucked up big time.I made a mistake that might kill me.I started my EVA around 08:45, same as always.I got my hammer and screwdriver and started chipping the trailers hull.Its a pain in the ass to make a chip before each drilling, so I make all the days chips in a single go.After chipping out 150 divots (hey, Im an optimist), I got to work.It was the same as yesterday and the day before.Drill through, relocate.Drill through, relocate.Drill through a third time, then set the drill aside to cool.Repeat that process over and over till lunchtime.At 12:00, I took a break.Back in the Hab, I enjoyed a nice lunch and played some chess against the computer (it kicked my ass).Then back out for the days second EVA.At 13:30 my ruination occurred, though I didnt realize it at the time.The worst moments in life are heralded by small observations.The tiny lump on your side that wasnt there before.Coming home to your wife and seeing two wineglasses in the sink.Anytime you hear We interrupt this program  For me, it was when the drill didnt start.Only three minutes earlier, it was working fine.I had finished a hole and set the drill aside to cool.Same as always.But when I tried to get back to work, it was dead.The power light wouldnt even come on.I wasnt worried.If all else failed, I had another drill.It would take a few hours to wire it up, but thats hardly a concern.The power light being off meant there was probably something wrong with the line.A quick glance at the airlock window showed the lights were on in the Hab.So there were no systemic power problems.I checked my new breakers, and sure enough, all three had tripped.I guess the drill pulled a little too much amperage.No big deal.I reset the breakers and got back to work.The drill fired right up, and I was back to making holes.Doesnt seem like a big deal, right?I certainly didnt think so at the time.I finished my day at 17:00 after drilling 131 holes.Not as good as yesterday, but I lost some time to the drill malfunction.I reported my progress.[17:08] Watney: 131 holes today.488 total.Minor drill issue; it tripped the breakers.There may be an intermittent short in the drill, probably in the attachment point of the power line.Might need to redo it.Earth and Mars are just over eighteen light minutes apart now.Usually, NASA responds within twenty five minutes.Remember, I do all my communication from Rover 2, which relays everything through Pathfinder.I cant just lounge in the Hab awaiting a reply; I have to stay in the rover until they acknowledge the message.[17:38] Watney: Have received no reply.Last message sent 30 minutes ago.Please acknowledge.I waited another thirty minutes.Still no reply.Fear started to take root.Back when JPLs Nerd Brigade hacked the rover and Pathfinder to be a poor mans IM client, they sent me a cheat sheet for troubleshooting.I executed the first instruction:  [18:09] Watney: system_command: STATUS  [18:09] SYSTEM: Last message sent 00h31m ago.Last message received 26h17m ago.Last ping reply from probe received 04h24m ago.WARNING: 52 unanswered pings.Pathfinder was no longer talking to the rover.It had stopped answering pings four hours and twenty four minutes ago.Some quick math told me that was around 13:30 today.The same time the drill died.I tried not to panic.The troubleshooting sheet has a list of things to try if communication is lost.They are (in order):  1.Confirm power still flowing to Pathfinder.2.Reboot rover.3.Reboot Pathfinder by disconnecting/reconnecting power.4.Install rovers comm software on the other rovers computer, try from there.5.If both rovers fail, problem is likely with Pathfinder.Check connections very closely.Clean Pathfinder of Martian dust.6.Spell message in Morse code with rocks, include things attempted.Problem may be recoverable with remote update of Pathfinder.I only got as far as step 1.I checked Pathfinders connections and the negative lead was no longer attached.I was elated!What a relief!With a smile on my face, I fetched my electronics kit and prepared to reattach the lead.I pulled it out of the probe to give it a good cleaning (as best I could with the gloves of my space suit) and noticed something strange.The insulation had melted.I pondered this development.Melted insulation usually means a short.More current than the wire could handle had passed through.But the bare portion of the wire wasnt black or even singed, and the positive leads insulation wasnt melted at all.Then, one by one, the horrible realities of Mars came into play.The wire wouldnt be burned or singed.Thats a result of oxidization.And theres no oxygen in the air.There likely was a short after all.But with the positive lead being unaffected, the power must have come from somewhere else  And the drills breaker tripped around the same time  Oh shit  The internal electronics for Pathfinder included a ground lead to the hull.This way it could not build up a static charge in Martian weather conditions (no water and frequent sandblasting can make impressive static charge).The hull sat on Panel A, one of four sides of the tetrahedron which brought Pathfinder to Mars.The other three sides are still in Ares Vallis where I left them.Between Panel A and the workbench were the Mylar balloons Pathfinder had used to tumble land.I had shredded many of them to transport it, but a lot of material remainedenough to reach around Panel A and be in contact with the hull.I should mention that Mylar is conductive.At 13:30, I leaned the drill against the workbench.The drills cowling was off to make room for the power line.The workbench is metal.If the drill leaned against the workbench just right, it could make a metal to metal connection.And thats exactly what had happened.Power traveled from the drill lines positive lead, through the workbench, through the Mylar, through Pathfinders hull, through a bunch of extremely sensitive and irreplaceable electronics, and out the negative lead of Pathfinders power line.Pathfinder operates on 50 milliamps.It got 9000 milliamps, which plowed through the delicate electronics, frying everything along the way.The breakers tripped, but it was too late.Pathfinders dead.Ive lost the ability to contact Earth.Im on my own.Chapter 18      LOG ENTRY: SOL 197  Sigh  Just once Id like something to go as planned, ya know?Mars keeps trying to kill me.Well Mars didnt electrocute Pathfinder.So Ill amend that:  Mars and my stupidity keep trying to kill me.Okay, enough self pity.Im not doomed.Things will just be harder than planned.I have all I need to survive.And Hermes is still on the way.I spelled out a Morse code message using rocks.PF FRIED WITH 9 AMPS.DEAD FOREVER.PLAN UNCHANGED.WILL GET TO MAV.If I can get to the Ares 4 MAV, Ill be set.But having lost contact with NASA, I have to design my own Great Martian Winnebago to get there.For the time being, Ive stopped all work on it.I dont want to continue without a plan.Im sure NASA had all kinds of ideas, but now I have to come up with one on my own.As I mentioned, the Big Three (atmospheric regulator, oxygenator, and water reclaimer) are critical components.I worked around them for my trip to Pathfinder.I used CO2 filters to regulate the atmosphere, and brought enough oxygen and water for the whole trip.That wont work this time.I need the Big Three.Problem is, they soak up a lot of power, and they have to run all day long.The rover batteries have 18 kilowatt hours of juice.The oxygenator alone uses 44.1 kilowatt hours per sol.See my problem?You know what?Kilowatt hours per sol is a pain in the ass to say.Im gonna invent a new scientific unit name.One kilowatt hour per sol is it can be anything um I suck at this Ill call it a pirate ninja.All told, the Big Three need 69.2 pirate ninjas, most of that going to the oxygenator and the atmospheric regulator.(The water reclaimer only needs 3.6 of that. )Therell be cutbacks.The easiest cutback is the water reclaimer.I have 620 liters of water (I had a lot more before the Hab blew up).I need only three liters of water per sol, so my supply will last 206 sols.Theres only 100 sols after I leave and before Im picked up (or die in the attempt).Conclusion: I dont need the water reclaimer at all.Ill drink as needed and dump my waste outdoors.Yeah, thats right, Mars, Im gonna piss and shit on you.Thats what you get for trying to kill me all the time.There.I saved myself 3.6 pirate ninjas.LOG ENTRY: SOL 198  Ive had a breakthrough with the oxygenator!I spent most of the day looking at the specs.It heats CO2 to 900C, then passes it over a zirconia electrolysis cell to yank the carbon atoms off.Heating the gas is what takes most of the energy.Why is that important?Because Im just one guy and the oxygenator was made for six.One sixth the quantity of CO2 means one sixth the energy to heat it.The spec says it draws 44.1 pirate ninjas, but all this time its only been using 7.35 because of the reduced load.Now were getting somewhere!Then theres the matter of the atmospheric regulator.The regulator samples the air, figures out whats wrong with it, and corrects the problem.Too much CO2?Take it out.Not enough O2?Add some.Without it, the oxygenator is worthless.The CO2 needs to be separated in order to be processed.The regulator analyzes the air with spectroscopy, then separates the gasses by supercooling them.Different elements turn to liquid at different temperatures.On Earth, supercooling this much air would take ridiculous amounts of energy.But (as Im acutely aware) this isnt Earth.Here on Mars, supercooling is done by pumping air to a component outside the Hab.The air quickly cools to the outdoor temperature, which ranges from 150C to 0C.When its warm, additional refrigeration is used, but cold days can turn air to liquid for free.The real energy cost comes from heating it back up.If it came back to the Hab unheated, Id freeze to death.But wait!Youre thinking, Marss atmosphere isnt liquid.Why does the Habs air condense?The Habs atmosphere is over 100 times as dense, so it turns to liquid at much higher temperatures.The regulator gets the best of both worlds.Literally.Side note: Marss atmosphere does condense at the poles.In fact, it solidifies into dry ice.Problem: The regulator takes 21.5 pirate ninjas.Even adding some of the Habs power cells would barely power the regulator for a sol, let alone give me enough juice to drive.More thinking is required.LOG ENTRY: SOL 199  Ive got it.I know how to power the oxygenator and atmospheric regulator.The problem with small pressure vessels is CO2 toxicity.You can have all the oxygen in the world, but once the CO2 gets above 1 percent, youll start to get drowsy.At 2 percent, its like being drunk.At 5 percent, its hard to stay conscious.Eight percent will eventually kill you.Staying alive isnt about oxygen, its about getting rid of CO2.That means I need the regulator.But I dont need the oxygenator all the time.I just need to get CO2 out of the air and back fill with oxygen.I have 50 liters of liquid oxygen in two 25 liter tanks here in the Hab.Thats 50,000 liters in gaseous form, enough to last 85 days.Not enough to see me through to rescue, but a hell of a lot.The regulator can separate the CO2 and store it in a tank, and it can add oxygen to my air from my oxygen tanks as needed.When I run low on oxygen, I can camp out for a day and use all my power to run the oxygenator on the stored CO2.That way, the oxygenators power consumption doesnt eat up my driving juice.So Ill run the regulator all the time, but only run the oxygenator on days I dedicate to using it.Now, on to the next problem.After the regulator freezes the CO2 out, the oxygen and nitrogen are still gasses, but theyre 75C.If the regulator fed that back to my air without reheating it, Id be a Popsicle within hours.Most of the regulators power goes to heating the return air so that doesnt happen.But I have a better way to heat it up.Something NASA wouldnt consider on their most homicidal day.The RTG!Yes, the RTG.You may remember it from my exciting trip to Pathfinder.A lovely lump of plutonium so radioactive it gives off 1500 watts of heat, which it uses to harvest 100 watts of electricity.So what happens to the other 1400 watts?It gets radiated out as heat.On the trip to Pathfinder, I had to actually remove insulation from the rover to vent excess heat from the damn thing.Ill be taping that back in place because Ill need that heat to warm up the return air from the regulator.I ran the numbers.The regulator uses 790 watts to constantly reheat air.The RTGs 1400 watts is more than equal to the task, as well as keeping the rover a reasonable temperature.To test, I shut down the heaters in the regulator and noted its power consumption.After a few minutes, I turned them right back on again.Jesus Christ that return air was cold.But I got the data I wanted.With heating, the regulator needs 21.5 pirate ninjas.Without it (drumroll) 1 pirate ninja.Thats right, almost all of the power was going to heat.As with most of lifes problems, this one can be solved by a box of pure radiation.I spent the rest of the day double checking my numbers and running more tests.It all checks out.I can do this.LOG ENTRY: SOL 200  I hauled rocks today.I needed to know what kind of power efficiency the rover/trailer will get.On the way to Pathfinder, I got 80 kilometers from 18 kilowatt hours.This time, the load will be a lot heavier.Ill be towing the trailer and all the other shit.I backed the rover up to the trailer and attached the tow clamps.Easy enough.The trailer has been depressurized for some time now (theres a couple of hundred little holes in it, after all), so I opened both airlock doors to have a straight shot at the interior.Then I threw a bunch of rocks in.I had to guess at the weight.The heaviest thing Ill bring with me is the water.620 kilograms worth.My freeze dried potatoes will add another 200 kilograms.Ill probably have more solar cells than before, and maybe a battery from the Hab.Plus the atmospheric regulator and oxygenator, of course.Rather than weigh all that shit, I took a guess and called it 1200 kilograms.Half a cubic meter of basalt weighs about that much (more or less).After two hours of brutal labor, during which I whined a lot, I got it all loaded in.Then, with both batteries fully charged, I drove circles around the Hab until I drained them both.With a blistering top speed of 25 kph, its not an action packed thrill ride.But I was impressed it could maintain that speed with all the extra weight.The rover has spectacular torque.But physical law is a pushy little shit, and it exacted revenge for the additional weight.I only got 57 kilometers before I was out of juice.That was 57 kilometers on level ground, without having to power the regulator (which wont take much with the heater off).Call it 50 kilometers per day to be safe.At that rate it would take 64 days to get to Schiaparelli.But thats just the travel time.Every now and then, Ill need to break for a day and let the oxygenator use all the power.How often?After a bunch of math I worked out that my 18 pirate ninja budget can power the oxygenator enough to make about 2.5 sols of O2.Id have to stop every two to three sols to reclaim oxygen.My sixty four sol trip would become ninety two!Thats too long.Ill tear my own head off if I have to live in the rover that long.Anyway, Im exhausted from lifting rocks and whining about lifting rocks.I think I pulled something in my back.Gonna take it easy the rest of today.LOG ENTRY: SOL 201  Yeah, I definitely pulled something in my back.I woke up in agony.So I took a break from rover planning.Instead, I spent the day taking drugs and playing with radiation.First, I loaded up on Vicodin for my back.Hooray for Becks medical supplies!Then I drove out to the RTG.It was right where I left it, in a hole four kilometers away.Only an idiot would keep that thing near the Hab.So anyway, I brought it back to the Hab.Either itll kill me or it wont.A lot of work went into making sure it doesnt break.If I cant trust NASA, who can I trust?(For now Ill forget that NASA told us to bury it far away. )I stored it on the roof of the rover for the trip back.That puppy really spews heat.I have some flexible plastic tubing intended for minor water reclaimer repairs.After bringing the RTG into the Hab, I very carefully glued some tubing around the heat baffles.Using a funnel made from a piece of paper, I ran water through the tubing, letting it drain into a sample container.Sure enough, the water heated up.Thats not really a surprise, but its nice to see thermodynamics being well behaved.Theres one tricky bit: The atmospheric regulator doesnt run constantly.The freeze separation speed is driven by the weather outside.So the returning frigid air doesnt come as a steady flow.And the RTG generates a constant, predictable heat.It cant ramp up its output.So Ill heat water with the RTG to create a heat reservoir, then Ill make the return air bubble through it.That way I dont have to worry about when the air comes in.And I wont have to deal with sudden temperature changes in the rover.When the Vicodin wore off, my back hurt even more than before.Im going to need to take it easy.I cant just pop pills forever.So Im taking a few days off from heavy labor.To that end, I made a little invention just for me  I took Johanssens cot and cut out the hammock.Then I draped spare Hab canvas over the frame, making a pit inside the cot, with extra canvas around the edges.Once I weighed down the excess canvas with rocks, I had a water tight bathtub!It only took 100 liters to fill the shallow tub.Then, I stole the pump from the water reclaimer.(I can go quite a while without the water reclaimer operating. )I hooked it up to my RTG water heater and put both the input and output lines into the tub.Yes, I know this is ridiculous, but I hadnt had a bath since Earth, and my back hurts.Besides, Im going to spend 100 sols with the RTG anyway.A few more wont hurt.Thats my bullshit rationalization and Im sticking with it.It took two hours to heat the water to 37C.Once it did, I shut off the pump and got in.Oh man!All I can say is Ahhhhhh.Why the hell didnt I think of this before?LOG ENTRY: SOL 207  I spent the last week recovering from back problems.The pain wasnt bad, but there arent any chiropractors on Mars, so I wasnt taking chances.I took hot baths twice a day, lay in my bunk a lot, and watched shitty seventies TV.Ive already seen Lewiss entire collection, but I didnt have much else to do.I was reduced to watching reruns.I got a lot of thinking done.I can make everything better by having more solar panels.The fourteen panels I took to Pathfinder provided the 18 kilowatt hours that the batteries could store.When traveling, I stowed the panels on the roof.The trailer gives me room to store another seven (half of its roof will be missing because of the hole Im cutting in it).This trips power needs will be driven by the oxygenator.It all comes down to how much power I can give that greedy little bastard in a single sol.I want to minimize how often I have days with no travel.The more juice I can give the oxygenator, the more oxygen itll liberate, and the longer I can go between those air sols.Lets get greedy.Lets say I can find a home for fourteen more panels instead of seven.Not sure how to do that, but lets say I can.That would give me thirty six pirate ninjas to work with, which would net me five sols of oxygen per air sol.Id only have to stop once per five sols.Thats much more reasonable.Plus, if I can arrange battery storage for the extra power, I could drive 100 kilometers per sol!Easier said than done, though.That extra 18 kilowatt hours of storage will be tough.Ill have to take two of the Habs 9 kilowatt hour fuel cells and load them onto the rover or trailer.They arent like the rovers batteries; theyre not small or portable.Theyre light enough, but theyre pretty big.I may have to attach them to the outside hull, and that would eat into my solar cell storage.One hundred kilometers per sol is pretty optimistic.But lets say I could make 90 kilometers per sol, stopping every fifth sol to reclaim oxygen.Id get there in forty five sols.That would be sweet!In other news, it occurred to me that NASA is probably shitting bricks.Theyre watching me with satellites and havent seen me come out of the Hab for six days.With my back better, it was time to drop them a line.I headed out for an EVA.This time, being very careful while lugging rocks around, I spelled out a Morse code message: INJURED BACK.BETTER NOW.CONTINUING ROVER MODS.That was enough physical labor for today.I dont want to overdo it.Think Ill have a bath.LOG ENTRY: SOL 208  Today, it was time to experiment with the panels.First, I put the Hab on low power mode: no internal lights, all nonessential systems offline, all internal heating suspended.Id be outside most of the day anyway.Then I detached twenty eight panels from the solar farm and dragged them to the rover.I spent four hours stacking them this way and that.The poor rover looked like the Beverly Hillbillies truck.Nothing I did worked.The only way to get all twenty eight on the roof was to make stacks so high theyd fall off the first time I turned.If I lashed them together, theyd fall off as a unit.If I found a way to attach them perfectly to the rover, the rover would tip.I didnt even bother to test.It was obvious by looking, and I didnt want to break anything.I havent removed the chunk of hull from the trailer yet.Half the holes are drilled, but Im not committed to anything.If I left it in place, I could have four stacks of seven cells.That would work fine; its just two rovers worth of what I did for the trip to Pathfinder.Problem is I need that opening.The regulator has to be in the pressurized area and its too big to fit in the unmodified rover.Plus which, the oxygenator needs to be in a pressurized area while operating.Ill only need it every five sols, but what would I do on that sol?No, the hole has to be there.As it is, Ill be able to stow twenty one panels.I need homes for the other seven.Theres only one place they can go: the sides of the rover and trailer.One of my earlier modifications was saddlebags draped over the rover.One side held the extra battery (stolen from what is now the trailer), while the other side was full of rocks as counterweight.I wont need the bags this time around.I can return the second battery to the trailer from whence it came.In fact, itll save me the hassle of the mid drive EVA I had to do every day to swap cables.When the rovers are linked up, they share resources, including electricity.I went ahead and reinstalled the trailers battery.It took me two hours, but its out of the way now.I removed the saddlebags and set them aside.They may be handy down the line.If Ive learned one thing from my stay at Club Mars, its that everything can be useful.I had liberated the sides of the rover and the trailer.After staring at them for a while, I had my solution.Ill make L brackets that stick out from the undercarriages, with the hooks facing up.Two brackets per side to make a shelf.I can set panels on the shelves and lean them against the rover.Then Ill lash them to the hull with homemade rope.Therell be four shelves total; two on the rover and two on the trailer.If the brackets stick out far enough to accommodate two panels, I could store eight additional panels that way.That would give me one more panel than Id even planned for.Ill make those brackets and install them tomorrow.I would have done it today, but it got dark and I got lazy.LOG ENTRY: SOL 209  Cold night last night.The solar cells were still detached from the farm, so I had to leave the Hab in low power mode.I did turn the heat back on (Im not insane), but I set the internal temperature to 1C to conserve power.Waking up to frigid weather felt surprisingly nostalgic.I grew up in Chicago, after all.But nostalgia only lasts so long.I vowed to complete the brackets today, so I can return the panels to the farm.Then I can turn the damn heat back on.I headed out to the MAVs landing strut array to scavenge metal for the shelves.Most of the MAV is made from composite, but the struts had to absorb the shock of landing.Metal was the way to go.I brought a strut into the Hab to save myself the hassle of working in an EVA suit.It was a triangular lattice of metal strips held together with bolts.I disassembled it.Shaping the brackets involved a hammer and well, thats it, actually.Making an L doesnt take a lot of precision.I needed holes where the bolts would pass through.Fortunately, my Pathfinder murdering drill made short work of that task.I was worried it would be hard to attach the brackets to the rovers undercarriage, but it ended up being simple.The undercarriage comes right off.After some drilling and bolting, I got the brackets attached to it and then mounted it back on the rover.I repeated the process for the trailer.Important notethe undercarriage is not part of the pressure vessel.The holes I drilled wont let my air out.I tested the brackets by hitting them with rocks.This kind of sophistication is what we interplanetary scientists are known for.After convincing myself the brackets wouldnt break at the first sign of use, I tested the new arrangement.Two stacks of seven solar cells on the roof of the rover; another seven on the trailer, then two per shelf.They all fit.After lashing the cells in place, I took a little drive.I did some basic acceleration and deceleration, turned in increasingly tight circles, and even did a power stop.The cells didnt budge.Twenty eight solar cells, baby!And room for one extra!After some well earned fist pumping, I unloaded the cells and dragged them back to the farm.No Chicago morning for me tomorrow.LOG ENTRY: SOL 211  I am smiling a great smile.The smile of a man who fucked with his car and didnt break it.I spent today removing unnecessary crap from the rover and trailer.I was pretty damn aggressive about it, too.Space inside the pressure vessels is at a premium.The more crap I clear out of the rover, the more space there is for me.The more crap I clear out of the trailer, the more supplies I can store in it, and the less I have to store in the rover.First off: Each vehicle had a bench for passengers.Bye!Next: Theres no reason for the trailer to have life support.The oxygen tanks, nitrogen tanks, CO2 filter assembly all unnecessary.Itll be sharing air with the rover (which has its own copy of each of those), and itll be carrying the regulator and oxygenator.Between the Hab components and the rover, Ill have two redundant life support systems.Thats plenty.Then I yanked the drivers seat and control panel out of the trailer.The linkup with the rover is physical.The trailer doesnt do anything but get dragged along and fed air.It doesnt need controls or brains.However, I did salvage its computer.Its small and light, so Ill bring it with me.If something goes wrong with the rovers computer en route, Ill have a spare.The trailer had tons more space now.It was time for experimentation.The Hab has twelve 9 kilowatt hour batteries.Theyre bulky and awkward.Over two meters tall, a half meter wide, and three quarters of a meter thick.Making them bigger makes them take less mass per kilowatt hour of storage.Yeah, its counterintuitive.But once NASA figured out they could increase volume to decrease mass, they were all over it.Mass is the expensive part about sending things to Mars.I detached two of them.As long as I return them before the end of the day, things should be fine.The Hab mostly uses the batteries at night.With both of the trailers airlock doors open I was able to get the first battery in.After playing real life Tetris for a while I found a way to get the first battery out of the way enough to let the second battery in.Together, they eat up the whole front half of the trailer.If I hadnt cleared the useless shit out earlier today, Id never have gotten them both in.The trailers battery is in the undercarriage, but the main power line runs through the pressure vessel, so I was able to wire the Hab batteries directly in (no small feat in the damn EVA suit).A system check from the rover showed I had done the wiring correctly.This may all seem minor, but its awesome.It means I can have twenty nine solar cells and 36 kilowatt hours of storage.Ill be able to do my 100 kilometers per day after all.Four days out of five, anyway.According to my calendar, the Hermes resupply probe is being launched from China in two days (if there were no delays).If that screws up, the whole crew will be in deep shit.Im more nervous about that than anything else.Ive been in mortal danger for months; Im kind of used to it now.But Im nervous again.Dying would suck, but my crewmates dying would be way worse.And I wont find out how the launch went till I get to Schiaparelli.Good luck, guys.Chapter 19   Hey, Melissa said Robert.Am I getting through?Can you see me?Loud and clear, babe, said Commander Lewis.The video link is solid.They say I have five minutes, Robert said.Better than nothing, Lewis said.Floating in her quarters, she gently touched the bulkhead to stop drifting.Its nice to see you in real time for a change.Yeah.Robert smiled.I can hardly notice the delay.I gotta say, I wish you were coming home.Lewis sighed.Me, too, babe.Dont get me wrong, Robert quickly added.I understand why youre doing all this.Still, from a selfish point of view,

said.We still have to go through customs, and well probably have to fill out a bunch of forms because were U. S.  government officials Its gonna be hours before we sleep.Craaaap.Gathering their carry on luggage, they trudged off the plane with the rest of the weary travelers.Beijing Capital International Airports Terminal 3 echoed with the cacophony common to huge air terminals.Venkat and Teddy moved toward the long immigration line as the Chinese citizens from their flight split off to go to a simpler point of entry process.As Venkat took his place in line, Teddy filed in behind him and scanned the terminal for a convenience store.Any form of caffeine would be welcome.Excuse me, gentlemen, came a voice from beside them.They turned to see a young Chinese man wearing jeans and a polo shirt.My name is Su Bin Bao, he said in perfect English.I am an employee of the China National Space Administration.I will be your guide and translator during your stay in the Peoples Republic of China.Nice to meet you, Mr.Su, Teddy said.Im Teddy Sanders, and this is Dr.Venkat Kapoor.We need sleep, Venkat said immediately.Just as soon as we get through customs, please get us to our hotel.I can do better than that, Dr.Kapoor.Su smiled.You are official guests of the Peoples Republic of China.You have been preauthorized to bypass customs.I can take you to your hotel immediately.I love you, Venkat said.Tell the Peoples Republic of China we said thanks, Teddy added.Ill pass that along.Su Bin smiled.*  Helena, my love, Vogel said to his wife.I trust you are well?Yes, she said.Im fine.But I do miss you.Sorry.Cant be helped.She shrugged.How are our monkeys?The children are fine.She smiled.Eliza has a crush on a new boy in her class, and Victor has been named goalkeeper for his high schools team.Excellent!Vogel said.I hear you are at Mission Control.Was NASA unable to pipe the signal to Bremen?They could have, she said.But it was easier for them to bring me to Houston.A free vacation to the United States.Who am I to turn that down?Well played.And how is my mother?As well as can be expected, Helena said.She has her good days and bad days.She did not recognize me on my last visit.In a way, its a blessing.She doesnt have to worry about you like I do.She hasnt worsened?he asked.No, shes about the same as when you left.The doctors are sure shell still be here when you return.Good, he said.I was worried Id seen her for the last time.Alex, Helena said, will you be safe?As safe as we can be, he said.The ship is in perfect condition, and after receiving the Taiyang Shen, we will have all the supplies we need for the remainder of the journey.Be careful.I will, my love, Vogel promised.*  Welcome to Jiuquan, Guo Ming said.I hope your flight was smooth?Su Bin translated Guo Mings words as Teddy took the second best seat in the observation room.He looked through the glass to Jiuquans Mission Control Center.It was remarkably similar to Houstons, though Teddy couldnt read any of the Chinese text on the big screens.Yes, thank you, Teddy said.The hospitality of your people has been wonderful.The private jet you arranged to bring us here was a nice touch.My people have enjoyed working with your advance team, Guo Ming said.The last month has been very interesting.Attaching an American probe to a Chinese booster.I believe this is the first time its ever been done.It just goes to show, Teddy said.Love of science is universal across all cultures.Guo Ming nodded.My people have especially commented on the work ethic of your man, Mitch Henderson.He is very dedicated.Hes a pain in the ass, Teddy said.Su Bin paused before translating but pressed on.Guo Ming laughed.You can say that, he said.I cannot.*  So explain it again, Becks sister Amy said.Why do you have to do an EVA?I probably dont, Beck explained.I just need to be ready to.Why?In case the probe cant dock with us.If something goes wrong, itll be my job to go out and grab it.Cant you just move Hermes to dock with it?No way, Beck said.Hermes is huge.Its not made for fine maneuvering control.Why does it have to be you?Cause Im the EVA specialist.But I thought you were the doctor.I am, Beck said.Everyone has multiple roles.Im the doctor, the biologist, and the EVA specialist.Commander Lewis is our geologist.Johanssen is the sysop and reactor tech.And so on.How about that good looking guy Martinez?Amy asked.What does he do?He pilots the MDV and MAV, Beck said.Hes also married with a kid, you lecherous homewrecker.Ah well.How about Watney?What did he do?Hes our botanist and engineer.And dont talk about him in the past tense.Engineer?Like Scotty?Kind of, Beck said.He fixes stuff.I bet thats coming in handy now.Yeah, no shit.*  The Chinese had arranged a small conference room for the Americans to work in.The cramped conditions were luxurious by Jiuquan standards.Venkat was working on budget spreadsheets when Mitch came in, so he was glad for the interruption.Theyre a weird bunch, these Chinese nerds, Mitch said, collapsing into a chair.But they make a good booster.Good, Venkat said.Hows the linkage between the booster and our probe?It all checks out, Mitch said.JPL followed the specs perfectly.It fits like a glove.Any concerns or reservations?Venkat asked.Yeah.Im concerned about what I ate last night.I think it had an eyeball in it.Im sure there wasnt an eyeball.The engineers here made it for me special, Mitch said.There may have been an eyeball, Venkat said.They hate you.Why?Cause youre a dick, Mitch, Venkat said.A total dick.To everyone.Fair enough.So long as the probe gets to Hermes, they can burn me in effigy for all I care.*  Wave to Daddy!Marissa said, waving Davids hand at the camera.Wave to Daddy!Hes too young to know whats going on, Martinez said.Just think of the playground cred hell have later in life, she said.My dad went to Mars.Whats your dad do?Yes, Im pretty awesome, he agreed.Marissa continued to wave Davids hand at the camera.David was more interested in his other hand, which was actively engaged in picking his nose.So, Martinez said, youre pissed.You can tell?Marissa asked.I tried to hide it.Weve been together since we were fifteen.I know when youre pissed.You volunteered to extend the mission five hundred and thirty three days, she said, asshole.Yeah, Martinez said.I figured thatd be the reason.Your son will be in kindergarten when you get back.He wont have any memories of you.I know, Martinez said.I have to wait another five hundred and thirty three days to get laid!So do I, he said defensively.I have to worry about you that whole time, she added.Yeah, he said.Sorry.She took a deep breath.Well get past it.Well get past it, he agreed.*  Welcome to CNNs Mark Watney Report.Today, we have the director of Mars operations, Venkat Kapoor.Hes speaking to us live via satellite from China.Dr.Kapoor, thank you for joining us.Happy to do it, Venkat said.So, Dr.Kapoor, tell us about the Taiyang Shen.Why go to China to launch a probe?Why not launch it from the US?Hermes isnt going to orbit Earth, Venkat said.Its just passing by on its way to Mars.And its velocity is huge.We need a booster capable of not only escaping Earths gravity but matching Hermess current velocity.Only the Taiyang Shen has enough power to do that.Tell us about the probe itself.It was a rush job, Venkat said.JPL only had thirty days to put it together.They had to be as safe and efficient as they could.Its basically a shell full of food and other supplies.It has a standard satellite thruster package for maneuvering, but thats it.And thats enough to fly to Hermes?The Taiyang Shen will send it to Hermes.The thrusters are for fine control and docking.And JPL didnt have time to make a guidance system.So itll be remote controlled by a human pilot.Who will be controlling it?Cathy asked.The Ares 3 pilot, Major Rick Martinez.As the probe approaches Hermes, hell take over and guide it to the docking port.And what if theres a problem?Hermes will have their EVA specialist, Dr.Chris Beck, suited up and ready the whole time.If necessary, he will literally grab the probe with his hands and drag it to the docking port.Sounds kind of unscientific.Cathy laughed.You want unscientific?Venkat smiled.If the probe cant attach to the docking port for some reason, Beck will open the probe and carry its contents to the airlock.Like bringing in the groceries?Cathy asked.Exactly like that, Venkat said.And we estimate it would take four trips back and forth.But thats all an edge case.We dont anticipate any problems with the docking process.Sounds like youre covering all your bases.Cathy smiled.We have to, Venkat said.If they dont get those supplies Well, they need those supplies.Thanks for taking the time to answer our questions, Cathy said.Always a pleasure, Cathy.*  Johanssens father fidgeted in the chair, unsure what to say.After a moment, he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and mopped sweat from his balding head.What if the probe doesnt get to you?he asked.Try not to think about that, Johanssen said.Your mother is so worried she couldnt even come.Im sorry, Johanssen mumbled, looking down.She cant eat, she cant sleep, she feels sick all the time.Im not much better.How can they make you do this?Theyre not making me do it, Dad.I volunteered.Why would you do that to your mother?he demanded.Sorry, Johanssen mumbled.Watneys my crewmate.I cant just let him die.He sighed.I wish wed raised you to be more selfish.She chuckled quietly.How did I end up in this situation?Im the district sales manager of a napkin factory.Why is my daughter in space?Johanssen shrugged.You were always scientifically minded, he said.It was great!Straight A student.Hanging around nerdy guys too scared to try anything.No wild side at all.You were every fathers dream daughter.Thanks, Dad, I  But then you got on a giant bomb that blasted you to Mars.And I mean that literally.Technically, she corrected, the booster only took me into orbit.It was the nuclear powered ion engine that took me to Mars.Oh, much better!Dad, Ill be all right.Tell Mom Ill be all right.What good will that do?he said.Shes going to be tied up in knots until youre back home.I know, Johanssen mumbled.But  What?But what?I wont die.I really wont.Even if everything goes wrong.What do you mean?Johanssen furrowed her brow.Just tell Mom I wont die.How?I dont understand.I dont want to get into the how, Johanssen said.Look, he said, leaning toward the camera, Ive always respected your privacy and independence.I never tried to pry into your life, never tried to control you.Ive been really good about that, right?Yeah.So in exchange for a lifetime of staying out of your business, let me nose in just this once.What are you not telling me?She fell silent for several seconds.Finally, she said, They have a plan.Who?They always have a plan, she said.They work out everything in advance.What plan?They picked me to survive.Im youngest.I have the skills necessary to get home alive.And Im the smallest and need the least food.What happens if the probe fails, Beth?her father asked.Everyone would die but me, she said.Theyd all take pills and die.Theyll do it right away so they dont use up any food.Commander Lewis picked me to be the survivor.She told me about it yesterday.I dont think NASA knows about it.And the supplies would last until you got back to Earth?No, she said.We have enough food left to feed six people for a month.If I was the only one, it would last six months.With a reduced diet I could stretch it to nine.But itll be seventeen months before I get back.So how would you survive?The supplies wouldnt be the only source of food, she said.He widened his eyes.Oh oh my god  Just tell Mom the supplies would last, okay?*  American and Chinese engineers cheered together at Jiuquan Mission Control.The main screen showed Taiyang Shens contrail wafting in the chilly Gobi sky.The ship, no longer visible to the naked eye, pressed onward toward orbit.Its deafening roar dwindled to a distant rumbling thunder.Perfect launch, Venkat exclaimed.Of course, said Zhu Tao.You guys really came through for us, Venkat said.And were grateful!Naturally.And hey, you guys get a seat on Ares 5.Everyone wins.Mmm.Venkat looked at Zhu Tao sideways.You dont seem too happy.I spent four years working on Taiyang Shen, he said.So did countless other researchers, scientists, and engineers.Everyone poured their souls into construction while I waged a constant political battle to maintain funding.In the end, we built a beautiful probe.The largest, sturdiest unmanned probe in history.And now its sitting in a warehouse.Itll never fly.The State Council wont fund another booster like that.He turned to Venkat.It could have been a lasting legacy of scientific research.Now its a delivery run.Well get a Chinese astronaut on Mars, but what science will he bring back that some other astronaut couldnt have?This operation is a net loss for mankinds knowledge.Well, Venkat said cautiously, its a net gain for Mark Watney.Mmm, Zhu Tao said.*  Distance 61 meters, velocity 2.3 meters per second, Johanssen said.No problem, Martinez said, his eyes glued to his screens.One showed the camera feed from Docking Port A, the other a constant feed of the probes telemetry.Lewis floated behind Johanssens and Martinezs stations.Becks voice came over the radio.Visual contact.He stood in Airlock 3 (via magnetic boots), fully suited up with the outer door open.The bulky SAFER unit on his back would allow him free motion in space should the need arise.An attached tether led to a spool on the wall.Vogel, Lewis said into her headset.You in position?Vogel stood in the still pressurized Airlock 2, suited up save his helmet.Ja, in position and ready, he replied.He was the emergency EVA if Beck needed rescue.All right, Martinez, Lewis said.Bring it in.Aye, Commander.Distance 43 meters, velocity 2.3 meters per second, Johanssen called out.All stats nominal, Martinez reported.Slight rotation in the probe, Johanssen said.Relative rotational velocity is 0.05 revolutions per second.Anything under 0.3 is fine, Martinez said.The capture system can deal with it.Probe is well within manual recovery range, Beck reported.Copy, Lewis said.Distance 22 meters, velocity 2.3 meters per second, Johanssen said.Angle is good.Slowing her down a little, Martinez said, sending instructions to the probe.Velocity 1.8 1.3 Johanssen reported.0.9 stable at 0.9 meters per second.Range?Martinez asked.Twelve meters, Johanssen replied.Velocity steady at 0.9 meters per second.Angle?Angle is good.Then were in line for auto capture, Martinez said.Come to Papa.The probe drifted gently to the docking port.Its capture boom, a long metal triangle, entered the ports funnel, scraping slightly along the edge.Once it reached the ports retractor mechanism, the automated system clamped on to the boom and pulled it in, aligning and orienting the probe automatically.After several loud clanks echoed through the ship, the computer reported success.Docking complete, Martinez said.Seal is tight, Johanssen said.Beck, Lewis said, your services wont be needed.Roger that, Commander, Beck said.Closing airlock.Vogel, return to interior, she ordered.Copy, Commander, he said.Airlock pressure to one hundred percent, Beck reported.Reentering ship Im back in.Also inside, Vogel said.Lewis pressed a button on her headset.Houster Jiuquan, probe docking complete.No complications.Mitchs voice came over the comm.Glad to hear it, Hermes.Report status of all supplies once you get them aboard and inspected.Roger, Jiuquan, Lewis said.Taking off her headset, she turned to Martinez and Johanssen.Unload the probe and stow the supplies.Im going to help Beck and Vogel de suit.Martinez and Johanssen floated down the hall toward Docking Port A.   So, he said, who would you have eaten first?She glared at him.Cause I think Id be tastiest, he continued, flexing his arm.Look at that.Good solid muscle there.Youre not funny.Im free range, you know.Corn fed.She shook her head and accelerated down the hall.Come on!I thought you liked Mexican!Not listening, she called back.Chapter 20      LOG ENTRY: SOL 376  Im finally done with the rover modifications!The tricky part was figuring out how to maintain life support.Everything else was just work.A lot of work.I havent been good at keeping the log up to date, so heres a recap:  First I had to finish drilling holes with the Pathfinder murderin drill.Then I chiseled out a billion little chunks between the holes.Okay, it was 759 but it felt like a billion.Then I had one big hole in the trailer.I filed down the edges to keep them from being too sharp.Remember the pop tents?I cut the bottom out of one and the remaining canvas was the right size and shape.I used seal strips to attach it to the inside of the trailer.After pressurizing and sealing up leaks as I found them, I had a nice big balloon bulging out of the trailer.The pressurized area is easily big enough to fit the oxygenator and atmospheric regulator.One hitch: I need to put the AREC outside.The imaginatively named atmospheric regulator external component is how the regulator freeze separates air.Why sink a bunch of energy into freezing stuff when you have incredibly cold temperatures right outside?The regulator pumps air to the AREC to let Mars freeze it.It does this along a tube that runs through a valve in the Habs wall.The return air comes back through another tube just like it.Getting the tubing through the balloon canvas wasnt too hard.I have several spare valve patches.Basically theyre ten by ten centimeter patches of Hab canvas with a valve in the middle.Why do I have these?Consider what would happen on a normal mission if the regulator valve broke.Theyd have to scrub the whole mission.Easier to send spares.The AREC is fairly small.I made a shelf for it just under the solar panel shelves.Now everythings ready for when I eventually move the regulator and AREC over.Theres still a lot to do.Im not in any hurry; Ive been taking it slow.One four hour EVA per day spent on work, the rest of the time to relax in the Hab.Plus, Ill take a day off every now and then, especially if my back hurts.I cant afford to injure myself now.Ill try to be better about this log.Now that I might actually get rescued, people will probably read it.Ill be more diligent and log every day.LOG ENTRY: SOL 380  I finished the heat reservoir.Remember my experiments with the RTG and having a hot bath?Same principle, but I came up with an improvement: submerge the RTG.No heat will be wasted that way.I started with a large rigid sample container (or plastic box to people who dont work at NASA).I ran a tube through the open top and down the inside wall.Then I coiled it in the bottom to make a spiral.I glued it in place like that and sealed the end.Using my smallest drill bit, I put dozens of little holes in the coil.The idea is for the freezing return air from the regulator to pass through the water as a bunch of little bubbles.The increased surface area will get the heat into the air better.Then I got a medium flexible sample container (Ziploc bag) and tried to seal the RTG in it.But the RTG has an irregular shape, and I couldnt get all the air out of the bag.I cant allow any air in there.Instead of heat going to the water, some would get stored in the air, which could superheat and melt the bag.I tried a bunch of times, but there was always an air pocket I couldnt get out.I was getting pretty frustrated until I remembered I have an airlock.Suiting up, I went to Airlock 2 and depressurized to a full vacuum.I plopped the RTG in the bag and closed it.Perfect vacuum seal.
