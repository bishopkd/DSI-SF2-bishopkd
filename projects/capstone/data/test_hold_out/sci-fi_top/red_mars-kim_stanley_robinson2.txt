Like an odometer, Boone said calmly as he looked at his dosimeter.He was gripping a rail with both hands and pulling himself back and forth, as if doing isometric exercises.Frank saw it and said, John, what the hell are you doing?Dodging, John said.He smiled at Franks frown.You know moving target!People laughed at him.With the extent of the danger precisely charted on screens and graphs, they were beginning to feel less helpless.This was illogical, but naming was the power that made every human a scientist of sorts.And these were scientists by profession, with many astronauts among them as well, trained to accept the possibility of such a storm.All those mental habits began channeling their thoughts, and the shock of the event receded a bit.They were coming to terms with it.Arkady went to a terminal and called up Beethovens Pastoral Symphony, picking it up in the third movement, when the village dance is disrupted by storm.He turned up the volume, and they floated together in the long half cylinder, listening to the intensity of Beethovens fierce tempest, which suddenly seemed to enunciate perfectly the lashings of the silent wind pouring through them.It would sound just like that!Strings and woodwinds shrieking in wild gusts, out of control and yet beautifully melodic at the same time a shiver ran down Mayas spine.She had never listened to the old warhorse this closely before, and she looked with admiration (and a bit of fear) at Arkady, who was beaming ecstatically at the effects of his inspired disk jockeying, and dancing like some red knot of fluff in the wind.When the symphonys storm peaked, it was difficult to believe that the radiation count wasnt rising; and when the musical storm abated, it seemed like theirs should be over too.Thunder muttered, the last gusts whistled through.The French horn sang its serene all clear.People began to talk about other things, discussing the various business of the day that had been so rudely interrupted, or taking the opportunity to talk about other things.After a half hour or more, one of those conversations got louder.Maya didnt hear how it began, but suddenly Arkady said, very loudly and in English, I dont think we should pay any attention to plans made for us back on Earth!Other conversations went silent, and people turned to look at him.He had popped up and was floating under the rotating roof of the chamber, where he could survey them all and speak like some mad flying spirit.I think we should make new plans, he said.I think we should be making them now.Everything should be redesigned from the beginning, with our own thinking expressed.It should extend everywhere, even to the first shelters we build.Why bother?Maya asked, annoyed at his grandstanding.Theyre good designs.It really was irritating; Arkady often took center stage, and people always looked at her as if she were somehow responsible for him, as if it were her job to keep him from pestering them.Buildings are the template of a society, Arkady said.Theyre rooms, Sax Russell pointed out.But rooms imply the social organization inside them.Arkady looked around, pulling people into the discussion with his gaze.The arrangement of a building shows what the designer thinks should go on inside.We saw that at the beginning of the voyage, when Russians and Americans were segregated into Torus D and B.  We were supposed to remain two entities, you see.It will be the same on Mars.Buildings express values, they have a sort of grammar, and rooms are the sentences.I dont want people in Washington or Moscow saying how I should live my life, Ive had enough of that.What dont you like about the design of the first shelters?John asked, looking interested.They are rectangular, Arkady said.This got a laugh, but he persevered: Rectangular, the conventional shape!With work space separated from living quarters, as if work were not part of life.And the living quarters are taken up mostly by private rooms, with hierarchies expressed, in that leaders are assigned larger spaces.Isnt that just to facilitate their work?Sax said.No.It isnt really necessary.Its a matter of prestige.A very conventional example of American business thinking, if I may say so.There was a groan, and Phyllis said, Do we have to get political, Arkady?At the very mention of the word, the cloud of listeners ruptured.Mary Dunkel and a couple of others pushed out and headed for the other end of the room.Everything is political, Arkady said at their backs.Nothing more so than this voyage of ours.We are beginning a new society, how could it help but be political?Were a scientific station, Sax said.It doesnt necessarily have much politics to it.It certainly didnt last time I was there, John said, looking thoughtfully at Arkady.It did, Arkady said, but it was simpler.You were an all American crew, there on a temporary mission, doing what your superiors told you to do.But now we are an international crew, establishing a permanent colony.Its completely different.Slowly people were drifting through the air toward the conversation, to hear better what was being said.Rya Jimenez said, Im not interested in politics, and Mary Dunkel agreed from the other end of the room: Thats one of the things Im here to get away from!Several Russians replied at once.That itself is a political position!and the like.Alex exclaimed, You Americans would like to end politics and history, so you can stay in a world you dominate!A couple of Americans tried to protest, but Alex overrode them.Its true!The whole world has changed in the last thirty years, every country looking at its function, making enormous changes to solve problems all but the United States.You have become the most reactionary country in the world.Sax said, The countries that changed had to because they were rigid before, and almost broke.The United States already had flex in its system, and so it didnt have to change as drastically.I say the American way is superior because its smoother.Its better engineering.This analogy gave Alex pause, and while he was thinking about it John Boone, who had been watching Arkady with great interest, said, Getting back to the shelters.How would you make them different?Arkady said, Im not quite sure we need to see the sites we build on, walk around in them, talk it over.Its a process I advocate, you see.But in general I think work space and living space should be mixed as much as is practical.Our work will be more than making wages it will be our art, our whole life.We will give it to each other, we will not buy it.Also there should be no signs of hierarchy.I dont even believe in the leader system we have now.He nodded politely at Maya.We are all equally responsible now, and our buildings should show it.A circle is best difficult in construction terms, but it makes sense for heat conservation.A geodesic dome would be a good compromise easy to construct, and indicating our equality.As for the inside, perhaps mostly open.Everyone should have their room, sure, but these should be small.Set in the rim, perhaps, and facing larger communal spaces He picked up a mouse at one terminal, began to sketch on the screen.There.This is architectural grammar that would say All equal.Yes?Theres lots of prefab units already there, John said.Im not sure they could be adapted.They could if we wanted to do it.But is it really necessary?I mean, its clear were already a team of equals.Is it clear?Arkady said sharply, looking around.If Frank and Maya tell us to do something, are we free to ignore them?If Houston or Baikonur tell us to do something, are we free to ignore them?I think so, John replied mildly.This statement got him a sharp look from Frank.The conversation was breaking up into several arguments, as a lot of people had things to say, but Arkady cut through them all again:  We have been sent here by our governments, and all of our governments are flawed, most of them disastrously.Its why history is such a bloody mess.Now we are on our own, and I for one have no intention of repeating all of Earths mistakes just because of conventional thinking.We are the first Martian colonists!We are scientists!It is our job to think things new, to make them new!The arguments broke out again, louder than ever.Maya turned away and cursed Arkady under her breath, dismayed at how angry people were getting.She saw that John Boone was grinning.He pushed off the floor toward Arkady, came to a stop by piling into him, and then shook Arkadys hand, which swung them both around in the air, in an awkward kind of dance.This gesture of support immediately set people to thinking again, Maya could see it on their surprised faces; along with Johns fame he had a reputation for being moderate and low keyed, and if he approved of Arkadys ideas, then it was a different matter.Goddammit, Ark, John said.First those crazy problem runs, and now this youre a wild man, you really are!How in the hell did you get them to let you on board this ship, anyway?Exactly my question, thought Maya.I lied, Arkady said.Everyone laughed.Even Frank, looking surprised.But of course I lied!Arkady shouted, a big upside down grin splitting his red beard.How else could I get here?I want to go to Mars to do what I want, and the selection committee wanted people to go and do what they were told.You know that!He pointed down at them and shouted, You all lied, you know you did!Frank was laughing harder than ever.Sax wore his usual Buster Keaton, but he raised a finger and said, The Revised Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and a great jeer went up from them all.They had all been required to take this exam; it was the worlds most widely used psychological test, and well regarded by experts.Respondents agreed or disagreed to 556 statements, and a profile was formed from the replies; but the judgments concerning what the answers meant were based on the earlier responses of a sample group of 2,600 white, married, middle class Minnesota farmers of the 1930s.Despite all subsequent revisions, the pervading bias created by the nature of that first test group was still deeply ingrained in the test or at least some of them thought so.Minnesota!Arkady shouted, rolling his eyes.Farmers!Farmers from Minnesota!I tell you this now, I lied in answer to every single question!I answered exactly opposite to what I really felt, and this is what allowed me to score as normal!Wild cheers greeted this announcement.Hell, John said, Im from Minnesota and I had to lie.More cheers.Frank, Maya noted, was crimson with hilarity, incapable of speech, hands clutching his stomach, nodding, giggling, helpless to stop himself.She had never seen him laugh like that.Sax said, The test made you lie.What, not you?Arkady demanded.Didnt you lie too?Well, no, Sax said, blinking as if the concept had never occurred to him before.I told the truth to every question.They laughed harder than ever.Sax looked startled at their response, but that only made him look funnier.Someone shouted, What do you say, Michel?How do you account for yourself?Michel Duval spread his hands.You may be underestimating the sophistication of the RMMPI.There are questions which test how honest you are being.This statement brought down a rain of questions on his head, a methodological inquisition.What were his controls?How did the testers make their theories falsifiable?How did they repeat them?How did they eliminate alternative explanations of the data?How could they claim to be scientific in any sense of the word whatsoever?Clearly a lot of them considered psychology a pseudoscience, and many had considerable resentment for the hoops they had been forced to jump through to get aboard.The years of competition had taken their toll.And the discovery of this shared feeling sparked a score of voluble conversations.The tension raised by Arkadys political talk disappeared.Perhaps, Maya thought, Arkady had defused the one with the other.If so it had been cleverly done, but Arkady was a clever man.She thought back.Actually it had been John Boone who had changed the subject.He had in effect flown to the ceiling and come to Arkadys rescue, and Arkady had seized the chance.They were both clever men.And it seemed possible they were in some sort of collusion.Forming a kind of alternative leadership, perhaps, one American, one Russian.Something would have to be done about that.She said to Michel, Do you think its a bad sign we all consider ourselves such liars?Michel shrugged.Its been healthy to talk about it.Now we realize were more alike than we thought.No one has to feel they were unusually dishonest to get aboard.And you?Arkady asked.Did you present yourself as a most rational and balanced psychologist, hiding the strange mind we have come to know and love?A small smile from Michel.Youre the expert in strange minds, Arkady.Then the few still watching the screens called out.The radiation count had started to fall.After a while it slipped back to just a little above normal.Someone returned the Pastoral to the moment of the horn call.The last movement of the symphony, Glad and Grateful Feelings After the Storm, poured from the speaker system, and as they left the shelter and fanned out through the ship like dandelion seeds on a breeze, the beautiful old folk melody was broadcast throughout the Ares, elaborating itself in all its Brucknerian richness.While it played, they found that the ships hardened systems had survived intact.The thicker walls of the farm and the forest biome had afforded the plants some protection, and although there would be some die offs, the seed stocks were not harmed.The animals could not be eaten either, but presumably would give birth to a healthy next generation.The only casualties were some uncaptured songbirds from Ds dining hall; they found a scattering of them dead on the floor.As for the crew, the shelters protection had shielded them from all but about six rem.That was bad for a mere three hours, but it could have been worse.The exterior of the ship had taken over 140 rem, a lethal dose.Six months inside a hotel, with never a walk outside.Inside it was late summer, and the days were long.Green dominated the walls and ceilings, and people went barefoot.Quiet conversations were nearly inaudible in the hum of machinery, the whoosh of ventilators.The ship seemed empty somehow, whole sections of it abandoned as the crew settled down to wait.Small knots of people sat in the halls in toruses B and D, talking.Some stopped their conversations when Maya wandered by, which she naturally found disturbing.She was having trouble falling asleep, trouble waking up.Work made her restless; all the engineers were only waiting, after all, and the simulations had gotten nearly intolerable.She had trouble gauging the passage of time.She stumbled more than she used to.She had gone to see Vlad, and he had recommended overhydration, more running, more swimming.Hiroko told her to spend more time on the farm.She gave it a try, spending hours weeding, harvesting, trimming, fertilizing, watering, talking, sitting on a bench, looking at leaves.Spacing out.The farm rooms were max chambers, their barrel roofs lined with bright sunstrips.The multi leveled floors were crowded with crops, many new since the storm.There was not enough space to feed the crew entirely on farm food, but Hiroko disliked that fact and struggled against it, converting storage rooms as they emptied out.Dwarf strains of wheat, rice, soy, and barley grew in stacked trays; above the trays were hanging rows of hydroponic vegetables, and enormous clear jars of green and yellow algae, used to help regulate the gas exchange.Some days Maya did nothing but watch the farm team work.Hiroko and her assistant Iwao were always tinkering at the endless project of maximizing the closure of their biological life support system, and they had a crew of other regulars working on it: Raul, Rya, Gene, Evgenia, Andrea, Roger, Ellen, Bob, and Tasha.Success in the closure attempt was measured in K values, K representing closure itself.Thus for every substance they recycled,  K = I   e/E    where E was the rate of consumption in the system, e the rate of (incomplete) closure, and I a constant for which Hiroko, earlier in her career, had established a corrected value.The goal, K = I   1, was unreachable, but asymptotically approaching it was the farm biologists favorite game, and more than that, critical to their eventual existence on Mars.So conversations about it could extend over days, spiraling off into complexities that no one really understood.In essence the farm team was already at their real work, which Maya envied.She was so sick of simulations!Hiroko was an enigma to Maya.Aloof and serious, she always seemed absorbed in her work, and her team tended always to be around her, as if she was the queen of a realm that had nothing to do with the rest of the ship.Maya didnt like that, but there was nothing she could do about it.And something in Hirokos attitude made it not so threatening; it was just a fact, the farm was a separate place, its crew a separate society.And it was possible that Maya could use them to counterbalance the influence of Arkady and John, somehow; so she did not worry about their separate realm.In fact she joined them more than ever before.Sometimes she went with them up to the hub at the end of a work session, to play a game they had invented called tunneljump.There was a jump tube down the central shaft, where all the joints between cylinders had been expanded to the same width as the cylinders themselves, making a single smooth tube.There were rails to facilitate quick movement back and forth along this tube, but in their game, jumpers stood on the storm shelter hatch, and tried to leap up the tube to the bubble dome hatch, a full 500 meters away, without bumping into the walls or railings.Coriolis forces made this effectively impossible, and flying even halfway would usually win a game.But one day Hiroko came by on her way to check an experimental crop in the bubble dome, and after greeting them she crouched on the shelter hatch and jumped, and slowly floated the full length of the tunnel, rotating as she flew, and stopping herself at the bubble dome hatch with a single outstretched hand.The players stared up the tunnel in stunned silence.Hey!Rya called to Hiroko.How did you do that?Do what?They explained the game to her.She smiled, and Maya was suddenly certain she had already known the rules.So how did you do it?Rya repeated.You jump straight!Hiroko explained, and disappeared into the bubble dome.That night at dinner the story got around.Frank said to Hiroko, Maybe you just got lucky.Hiroko smiled.Maybe you and I should total twenty jumps and see who wins.Sounds good to me.Whatll we bet?Money, of course.Hiroko shook her head.Do you really think money matters anymore?A few days later Maya floated under the curve of the bubble dome with Frank and John, looking ahead at Mars, which was now a gibbous orb the size of a dime.A lot of arguments these days, John remarked casually.I hear Alex and Mary got into an actual fight.Michel says its to be expected, but still ...Maybe we brought too many leaders, Maya said.Maybe you should have been the only one, Frank jibed.Too many chiefs?said John.Frank shook his head.Thats not it.No?There are a lot of stars on board.The urge to excel and the urge to lead arent the same.Sometimes I think they may be opposites.I leave the judgment to you, Captain.John grinned at Franks scowl.He was, Maya thought, the only relaxed person left among them.The shrinks saw the problem, Frank went on, it was obvious enough even for them.They used the Harvard solution.The Harvard solution, John repeated, savoring the phrase.Long ago Harvards administrators noticed that if they accepted only straight A high school students, and then gave out the whole range of grades to freshmen, a distressing number of them were getting unhappy at their Ds and Fs and messing up the Yard by blowing their brains out on it.Couldnt have that, John said.Maya rolled her eyes.You two must have gone to trade schools, eh?The trick to avoiding this unpleasantness, they found, was to accept a certain percentage of students who were used to getting mediocre grades, but had distinguished themselves in some other way  Like having the nerve to apply to Harvard with mediocre grades   used to the bottom of the grade curve, and happy just to be at Harvard at all.How did you hear of this?Maya asked.Frank smiled.I was one of them.We dont have any mediocrities on this ship, John said.Frank looked dubious.We do have a lot of smart scientists with no interest in running things.Many of them consider it boring.Administration, you know.Theyre glad to hand it over to people like us.Beta males, John said, mocking Frank and his interest in sociobiology.Brilliant sheep.The way they mocked each other ...Youre wrong, Maya said to Frank.Maybe so.Anyway, theyre the body politic.They have at least the power to follow.He said this as if the idea depressed him.John, due for a shift on the bridge, said good bye and left.Frank floated over to Mayas side, and she shifted nervously.They had never discussed their brief affair, and it hadnt come up, even indirectly, in quite a while.She had thought about what to say, if it ever did: she would say that she occasionally indulged herself with men she liked.That it had been something done on the spur of the moment.But he only pointed to the red dot in the sky.I wonder why were going.Maya shrugged.Probably he meant not we, but I.  Everyone has their reasons, she said.He glanced at her.Thats so true.She ignored his tone of voice.Maybe its our genes, she said.Maybe they felt things going wrong on Earth.Felt an increased speed of mutation, or something like that.So they struck out for a clean start.Yes.The selfish gene theory.Intelligence only a tool to aid successful reproduction.I suppose.But this trip endangers successful reproduction, Frank said.It isnt safe out here.But it isnt safe on Earth either.Waste, radiation, other people....Frank shook his head.No.I dont think the selfishness is in the genes.I think its somewhere else.He reached out with a forefinger and tapped her between the breasts a solid tap on the sternum, causing him to drift back to the floor.Staring at her the whole while, he touched himself in the same place.Good night, Maya.A week or two later Maya was in the farm harvesting cabbages, walking down an aisle between long stacked trays of them.She had the room to herself.The cabbages looked like rows of brains, pulsing with thought in the bright afternoon light.Then she saw a movement and looked to the side.Across the room, through an algae bottle, she saw a face.The glass of the bottle warped it: a mans face, brown skinned.The man was looking to the side and didnt see her.It appeared he was talking to someone she couldnt see.He shifted, and the image of his face came clear, magnified in the middle of the bottle.She understood why she was watching so closely, why her stomach was clenched: she had never seen him before.He turned and looked her way.Through two curves of glass their eyes met.He was a stranger, thin faced and big eyed.He disappeared in a brown blur.For a second Maya hesitated, scared to pursue him; then she forced herself to run the length of the room and up the two bends of the joint, into the next cylinder.It was empty.She ran through three more cylinders before stopping.Then she stood there looking at tomato vines, her breath rasping hard in her throat.She was sweating yet felt chilled.A stranger.It was impossible.But she had seen him!She concentrated on the memory, tried to see the face again.Perhaps it had been ...but no.It had been none of the hundred, she knew that.Facial recognition was one of the minds strongest abilities, it was amazingly accurate.And he had run away at the sight of her.A stowaway.But that too was impossible!Where would he hide, how would he live?What would he have done in the radiation storm?Had she begun to hallucinate, then?Had it come to that?She walked back to her room, sick to her stomach.The hallways of Torus D were somehow dark despite their bright illumination, and the back of her neck crawled.When the door appeared she dove into the refuge of her room.But her room was just a bed and a side table, a chair and a closet, some shelves of stuff.She sat there for an hour, then two.But there was nothing there for her to do, no answers, no distractions.No escape.Maya found herself unable to mention her sighting to anyone, and in a way this was more frightening than the incident itself, as it emphasized to her its impossibility.People would think she had gone mad.What other conclusion was there?How would he eat, where would he hide?No.Too many people would have to know, it really wasnt possible.But that face!One night she saw it again in a dream, and woke up in a sweat.Hallucination was one of the symptoms of space breakdown, as she well knew.It happened fairly frequently during long stays in Earth orbit, a couple dozen incidences had been recorded.Usually people started by hearing voices in the ever present background noise of ventilation and machinery, but a fairly common alternative was the sighting of a workmate who wasnt there, or worse yet of a doppelgnger, as if empty space had begun to fill with mirrors.Shortage of sensory stimuli was believed to cause the phenomena, and the situation on the Ares, with its long voyage, and no Earth to look at, and a brilliant (and some might say driven) crew, had been judged a potential hazard.This was one of the main reasons the ships rooms had been given so much variety of color and texture, along with changing daily and seasonal weather.And still she had seen something that couldnt be there.And now when she walked through the ship, it seemed to her that the crew was breaking up into small and private groups, groups that rarely interacted.The farm team spent almost all its time in the farms, even eating meals there on the floors, and sleeping (together, rumor had it) among the rows of plants.The medical team had its own suite of rooms and offices and labs in Torus B, and they spent their time in there, absorbed with experiments and observations and consultations with Earth.The flight team was preparing for MOI, running several simulations a day.And the rest were ...scattered.Hard to find.As she walked around the toruses the rooms seemed emptier than ever before.The D dining hall was never full anymore.And then again in the separated clumps of diners that were there, she noticed arguments broke out fairly frequently, and were hushed with peculiar speed.Private spats, but about what?Maya herself said less at table, and listened more.You could tell a lot about a society by what topics of conversation came up.In this crowd, the talk was almost always science.Shop talk: biology, engineering, geology, medicine, whatever.You could chat forever about that stuff.But when the number of people in a conversation fell below four, she noticed, the topics of conversation tended to change.Shop talk was augmented (or replaced entirely) by gossip; and the gossip was always about those two great forms of the social dynamic, sex and politics.Voices lowered, heads leaned in, and word got around.Rumors about sexual relations were becoming more common and more quiet, more caustic and more complex.In a few cases, as in the unfortunate triangle of Janet Blyleven, Mary Dunkel and Alex Zhalin, it went very public and became the talk of the ship; in others it stayed so hidden that the talk was in whispers, accompanied by pointed, inquisitive glances.Janet Blyleven would walk into the dining hall with Roger Calkins, and Frank would remark to John, in an undertone meant to reach Mayas ears, Janet thinks were a panmixia.Maya would ignore him, as she always did when he spoke in that sneery tone of voice, but later she looked up the word in a sociobiology lexicon, and found that a panmixia was a group where every male mated with every female.The next day she looked at Janet curiously; she had had no idea.Janet was friendly, she leaned in at you as you talked, and really paid attention.And she had a quick smile.But ...well, the ship had been built to insure a lot of privacy.No doubt there was more happening than anyone could know.And among these secret lives, might there not be another secret life, led in solitude, or in teamwork with some few among them, some small clique or cabal?Have you noticed anything funny lately?she asked Nadia one day at the end of their regular breakfast chat.Nadia shrugged.People are bored.Its about time to get there, I think.Maybe that was all it was.Nadia said, Did you hear about Hiroko and Arkady?Rumors were constantly swirling about Hiroko.Maya found it distasteful, disturbing.That the lone Asian woman among them should be the focus of that kind of thing dragon lady, mysterious Orient ...Underneath the scientific rational surfaces of their minds, there were so many deep and powerful superstitions.Anything might happen, anything was possible.Like a face seen through a glass.And so she listened with a tight feeling in her stomach, as Sasha Yefremov leaned over from the next table and responded to Nadias question by wondering if Hiroko were developing a male harem.That was nonsense; although an alliance of some sort between Hiroko and Arkady had an unsettling sort of logic to Maya, she was not sure why.Arkady was very open in advocating independence from Mission Control, Hiroko never talked about it at all, but in her actions hadnt she already led the whole farm team away, into a mental torus the others could never enter?But then when Sasha claimed in a low voice that Hiroko had plans to fertilize several of her own ova with sperm from all the men on the Ares, and store them cryonically for later growth on Mars, Maya could only sweep up her tray and head for the dishwashers, feeling something like vertigo.They were becoming strange.The red crescent grew to the size of a quarter, and the feeling of tension grew as well, as if it were the hour before a thunderstorm, and the air charged with dust and creosote and static electricity.As if the god of war were really up there on that blood dot, waiting for them.The green wall panels inside the Ares were now flecked with yellow and brown, and the afternoon light was thick with sodium vapors pale bronze.People spent hours in the bubble dome, watching what none among them but John had seen before.The exercise machines were in constant use, the simulations performed with renewed enthusiasm.Janet took a swing through the toruses, sending back video images of all the changes in their little world.Then she threw her glasses on a table and resigned her post as reporter.Look, Im tired of being an outsider, she said.Every time I walk into a room everyone shuts up, or starts preparing their official line.Its like I was a spy for an enemy!You were, Arkady said, and gave her a big hug.At first no one volunteered to take over her job.Houston sent messages of concern, then reprimands, then veiled threats.Now that they were about to reach Mars, the expedition was getting a lot more TV time, and the situation was about to go nova, as Mission Control put it.They reminded the colonists that this burst of publicity would eventually reap the space program all kinds of benefits; the colonists had to film and broadcast what they were doing, to stimulate public support for the later Mars missions on which they were going to depend.It was their duty to transmit their stories!Frank got on the screen and suggested that Mission Control could concoct their video reports out of footage from robot cameras.Hastings, head of Mission Control in Houston, was visibly infuriated by this response.But as Arkady said, with a grin that extended the realm of the question to everything: What can they do?Maya shook her head.They were sending a bad signal, and revealing what the video reports had so far hidden, that the group was splintering into rival cliques.Which indicated Mayas own lack of control over the Russian half of the expedition.She was about to ask Nadia to take over the reporting job as a favor to her when Phyllis and some of her friends in Torus B volunteered for the job.Maya, laughing at the expression on Arkadys face, gave it to them.Arkady pretended not to care.Irritated, Maya said in Russian, You know youve missed a chance!A chance to shape our reality, in effect!Not our reality, Maya.Their reality.And I dont care what they think.Maya and Frank began conferring about landfall assignments.To a certain extent these were predetermined by the crew members areas of expertise, but because of all the skill redundancies, there were still some choices to be made.And Arkadys provocations had had this effect at least: Mission Controls preflight plans were now generally regarded as provisional at best.In fact no one seemed all that inclined to acknowledge Maya or Franks authority either, which made things tense when it became known what they were working on.Mission Controls preflight plan called for the establishment of a base colony on the plains north of Ophir Chasma, the enormous northern arm of Valles Marineris.All the farm team was assigned to the base, and a majority of the engineers and medical people altogether, around sixty of the hundred.The rest would be scattered on subsidiary missions, returning to the base camp from time to time.The largest subsidiary mission was to dock a part of the disassembled Ares on Phobos, and begin transforming that moon into a space station.Another smaller mission would leave the base camp and travel north to the polar cap, to build a mining system which would transport blocks of ice back to the base.A third mission was to make a series of geological surveys, traveling all over the planet a glamour assignment for sure.All the smaller groups would become semi autonomous for periods of up to a year, so selecting them was no trivial matter; they knew well, now, how long a year could be.Arkady and a group of his friends Alex, Roger, Samantha, Edvard, Janet, Tatiana, Elena requested all the jobs on Phobos.When Phyllis and Mary heard about it, they came to Maya and Frank to protest.Theyre obviously trying to take over Phobos, and who knows what theyll do with it!Maya nodded, and she could see Frank didnt like it either.The problem was, no one else wanted to stay on Phobos.Even Phyllis and Mary werent clamoring to replace Arkadys crew, so it wasnt clear how to oppose him.Louder arguments broke out when Ann Clayborne passed around her crew list for the geological survey.A lot of people wanted to join that one, and several of those left off her list said they were going on surveys whether Ann wanted them or not.Arguments became frequent, and vehement.Almost everyone aboard declared themselves for one mission or another, positioning themselves for the final decisions.Maya felt that she was losing all control of the Russian contingent; she was getting furious at Arkady.In a general meeting she suggested sarcastically that they let the computer make the assignments.The idea was rejected with no regard for her authority.She threw up her hands.Then what do we do?No one knew.She and Frank conferred in private.Lets try giving them the illusion of making the decision, he said to her with a brief smile; she realized that he was not displeased to have seen her fail in the general meeting.Their encounter was coming back to haunt her, and she cursed herself for a fool.Little politburos were dangerous....Frank polled everyone concerning their wishes, and then displayed the results on the bridge, listing everyones first, second and third choices.The geological surveys were popular, while staying on Phobos was not.Everyone already knew this, and the posted lists proved that there were fewer conflicts than it had seemed.There are complaints about Arkady taking over Phobos, Frank said at the next public meeting.But no one but him and his friends want that job.Everyone else wants to get down to the surface.Arkady said, In fact we should get hardship compensation.Its not like you to talk about compensation, Arkady, Frank said smoothly.Arkady grinned and sat back down.Phyllis wasnt amused.Phobos will be a link between Earth and Mars, like the space stations in Earth orbit.You cant get from one planet to the other without them, theyre what naval strategists call choke points.I promise to keep my hands off your neck, Arkady said to her.Frank snapped, Were all going to be part of the same village!Anything we do affects all of us!And judging by the way youre acting, dividing up from time to time will be good for us.I for one wouldnt mind having Arkady out of my sight for a few months.Arkady bowed.Phobos here we come!But Phyllis and Mary and their crowd still were not happy.They spent a lot of time conferring with Houston, and whenever Maya went into Torus B conversations seemed to cease, eyes followed her suspiciously as if being Russian would automatically put her in Arkadys camp!She damned them for fools, and damned Arkady even more.He had started all this.But in the end it was hard to tell what was going on, with a hundred people scattered in what suddenly felt like such a large ship.Interest groups, micropolitics they really were fragmenting.One hundred people only, and yet they were too large a community to cohere!And there was nothing she or Frank could do about it.One night she dreamed again of the face in the farm.She woke shaken, and was unable to fall back asleep; and suddenly everything seemed out of control.They flew through the vacuum of space inside a small knot of linked cans, and she was supposed to be in charge of this mad argosy!It was absurd!She left her room, climbed Ds spoke tunnel to the central shaft.She pulled herself to the bubble dome, forgetting the tunneljump game.It was four a. m.  The inside of the bubble dome was like a planetarium after the audience has gone: silent, empty, with thousands of stars packed into the black hemisphere of the dome.Mars hung directly overhead, gibbous and quite distinctly spherical, as if a stone orange had been tossed among the stars.The four great volcanoes were visible pockmarks, and it was possible to make out the long rifts of Marineris.She floated under it, spread eagled and spinning very slightly, trying to comprehend it, trying to feel something specific in the dense interference pattern of her emotions.When she blinked, little spherical teardrops floated out and away among the stars.The lock door opened.John Boone floated in, saw her, grabbed the door handle to stop himself.Oh, sorry.Mind if I join you?No.Maya sniffed and rubbed her eyes.What gets you up at this hour?Im often up early.And you?Bad dreams.Of what?I cant remember, she said, seeing the face in her mind.He pushed off, floated past her to the dome.I can never remember my dreams.Never?Well, rarely.If something wakes me up in the middle of one, and I have time to think about it, then I might remember it, for a little while anyway.Thats normal.But its a bad sign if you never remember your dreams at all.Really?Whats it a symptom of?Of extreme repression, I seem to recall.She had drifted to the side of the dome; she pushed off through the air, stopped herself against the dome next to him.But that may be Freudianism.In other words something like the theory of phlogiston.She laughed.Exactly.They looked out at Mars, pointed out features to each other.Talked.Maya glanced at him as he spoke.Such bland, happy good looks; he really was not her type.In fact she had taken his cheeriness for a kind of stupidity, back at the beginning.But over the course of the voyage she had seen that he was not stupid.What do you think of all the arguments about what we should do up there?she asked, gesturing at the red stone ahead of them.I dont know.I think Phyllis makes a lot of good points.He shrugged.I dont think that matters.What do you mean?The only part of an argument that really matters is what we think of the people arguing.X claims a, Y claims b.  They make arguments to support their claims, with any number of points.But when their listeners remember the discussion, what matters is simply that X believes a and Y believes b.  People then form their judgment on what they think of X and Y.   But were scientists!Were trained to weigh the evidence.John nodded.True.In fact, since I like you, I concede the point.She laughed and pushed him, and they tumbled down the sides of the dome away from each other.Maya, surprised at herself, arrested her motion against the floor.She turned and saw John coming to a halt across the dome, landing against the floor.He looked at her with a smile, caught a rail and launched himself into the air, across the domed space on a course aimed at her.Instantly Maya understood, and forgetting completely her resolution to avoid this kind of thing, she pushed off to intercept him.They flew directly at each other, and to avoid a painful collision had to catch and twist in midair, as if dancing.They spun, hands clasped, spiraling up slowly toward the dome.It was a dance, with a clear and obvious end to it, there to reach whenever they liked: whew!Mayas pulse raced, and her breath was ragged in her throat.As they spun they tensed their biceps and pulled together, as slowly as docking spacecraft, and kissed.With a smile John pushed down from her, sending her flying to the dome, and him to the floor, where he caught and crawled to the chambers hatch.He locked it.Maya let her hair loose and shook it out so it floated around her head, across her face.She shook it wildly and laughed.It was not as though she felt on the verge of any great or overmastering love; it was simply going to be fun, and that feeling of simplicity was ...She felt a wild surge of lust, and pushed off the dome toward John.She tucked into a slow somersault, unzipping her jumper as she spun, her heart pounding like a timpani, all her blood rushing to her skin, which tingled as if thawing as she undressed, banged into John, flew away from him after an overhasty tug at a sleeve; they bounced around the chamber as they got their clothes off, miscalculating angles and momentums until with a gentle thrust of the big toes they flew into each other and met in a spinning embrace, and floated kissing among their floating clothes.In the days that followed they met again.They made no attempt to keep the relationship a secret, so very quickly they were a known item, a public couple.Many aboard seemed taken aback by the development, and one morning Maya walked into the dining hall and caught a swift glance from Frank, seated at a corner table, that chilled her; it reminded her of some other time, some incident, some look on his face that she couldnt quite call to mind.But most of those aboard seemed pleased.After all it was a kind of royal match, an alliance of the two powers behind the colony, signifying harmony.Indeed the union seemed to catalyze a number of others, which either came out of the closet or, in the newly supersaturated medium, sprang into being.Vlad and Ursula, Dmitri and Elena, Raul and Marina newly evident couples were everywhere, to the point where the singletons among them began to make nervous jokes about it.But Maya thought she noticed less tension in voices, fewer arguments, more laughter.One night, lying in bed thinking about it (thinking of wandering over to Johns room) she wondered if that was why they had gotten together: not from love, she still did not love him, she felt no more than friendship for him, charged by lust that was strong but impersonal but because it was, in fact, a very useful match.Useful to her but she swerved from that thought, concentrated on the matchs usefulness to the expedition as a whole.Yes, it was politic.Like feudal politics, or the ancient comedies of spring and regeneration.And it felt that way, she had to admit; as if she were acting in response to imperatives stronger than her own desires, acting out the desires of some larger force.Of, perhaps, Mars itself.It was not an unpleasant feeling.As for the idea that she might have gained leverage over Arkady, or Frank, or Hiroko ...Well, she successfully avoided thinking about that.It was one of Mayas talents.Blooms of yellow and red and orange spread across the walls.Mars was now the size of the moon in Earths sky.It was time to harvest all their effort; only a week more, and they would be there.There was still tension over the unsolved problems of landfall assignments.And now Maya found it less easy than ever to work with Frank; it was nothing obvious, but it occurred to her that he did not dislike their inability to control the situation, because the disruptions were being caused more by Arkady than anyone else, and so it looked like it was more her fault than his.More than once she left a meeting with Frank and went to John, hoping to get some kind of help.But John stayed out of the debates, and threw his support behind everything that Frank proposed.His advice to Maya in private was fairly acute, but the trouble was he liked Arkady, and disliked Phyllis; so often he recommended to her that she support Arkady, apparently unaware of the way this tended to undercut her authority among the other Russians.She never pointed this out to him, however.Lovers or not, there were still areas she didnt wish to discuss with him, or with anyone else.But one night in his room her nerves were jangling, and lying there, unable to sleep, worrying about first this and then that, she said, Do you think it would be possible to hide a stowaway on the ship?Well, I dont know, he said, surprised.Why do you ask?Swallowing hard, she told him about the face through the algae bottle.He sat up in bed, staring at her.Youre sure it wasnt ...It wasnt any of us.He rubbed his jaw.Well ...I suppose if he were getting help from someone in the crew ...Hiroko, Maya suggested.I mean, not just because shes Hiroko, but because of the farm and all that.It would solve his food problem, and theres a lot of places to hide there.And he could have taken shelter with the animals during the radiation storm.They got a lot of rems!But he could have gotten behind their water supply.A little one man shelter wouldnt be too hard to set up.John still hadnt gotten over the idea of it.Nine months in hiding!Its a big ship.It could be done, right?Well, I suppose so.Yeah, it could, I guess.But why?Maya shrugged.I have no idea.Someone who wanted on, who didnt make the selection.Someone who had a friend, or friends ...Still!I mean, a lot of us had friends who wanted to come.That doesnt mean that  I know, I know.They talked about it for most of an hour, discussing the possible reasons, the methods that could have been used to slip a passenger on board, to hide him, and so on.And then Maya suddenly noticed that she felt much better, that she was, in fact, in a wonderful mood.John believed her!He didnt think she had gone crazy!She felt a wash of relief and happiness, and threw her arms around him.Its so good to be able to talk to you about this!He smiled.Were friends, Maya.You should have brought it up before.Yes.The bubble dome would have been a wonderful place to view their final approach to Mars, but they were going to be aerobraking to reduce speed, and the dome would be behind the heat shield that they now deployed.There would be no view.Aerobraking saved them from the necessity of carrying the enormous amount of fuel it would have taken to slow down, but it was an extremely precise operation, and therefore dangerous.They had a leeway of less than a millisecond of arc, and so several days before MOI the navigation team began to tweak their course with small burns on an almost hourly basis, fine tuning the approach.Then as they got closer they stopped the ships rotation.The return to weightlessness, even in the toruses, was a shock.Suddenly it came home to Maya that it wasnt just another simulation.She lofted through the windy air of the hallways, seeing everything from a strange new high perspective, and all of a sudden it felt real.She slept in snatches, an hour here, three hours there.Every time she stirred, floating in her sleeping bag, she had a moment of disorientation, thinking she was in Novy Mir again.Then she would remember, and adrenaline would knock her awake.She would pull through the halls of the torus, pushing off the wall panels of brown and gold and bronze.On the bridge she would check with Mary or Raul or Marina, or someone else in navigation.Everything still on course.They were approaching Mars so quickly it seemed they could see it expanding on the screens.They had to miss the planet by thirty kilometers, or about one ten millionth of the distance they had traveled.No problem, Mary said, with a quick glance at Arkady.So far they were on the Mantra Run, and hopefully none of his mad problems would crop up.The crew members not involved with navigation worked to batten down, preparing everything for the torque and bumps that two and a half gs were sure to bring.Some of them got to go out on EVAs, to deploy subsidiary heat shields and the like.There was a lot to do, and yet the days seemed long anyway.It was going to happen in the middle of the night, and so that evening all the lights stayed on, and no one went to bed.Everyone had a station some on duty, most of them only waiting it out.Maya sat in her chair on the bridge, watching the screens and the monitors, thinking that they looked just like they would if it were all a simulation in Baikonur.Could they really be going into orbit around Mars?They could.The Ares hit Marss thin high atmosphere at 40,000 kilometers per hour, and instantly the ship was vibrating heavily, Mayas chair shaking her fast and hard, and there was a faint low roar, as if they flew through a blast furnace and it looked like that too, because the screens were bursting with an intense pink orange glow.Compressed air was bouncing off the heat shields and blazing past all the exterior cameras, so that the whole bridge was tinged the color of Mars.Then gravity returned with a vengeance; Mayas ribs were squeezed so hard that she had trouble breathing, and her vision was blurred.It hurt!They were plowing through the thin air at a speed and height calculated to put them into what aerodynamicists call transitional flow, a state halfway between free molecular flow and continuum flow.Free molecular flow would have been the preferred mode of travel, with the air that struck the heat shield shoved to the sides, and the resulting vacuum refilled mostly by molecular diffusion; but they were moving too fast for that, and they could only just barely avoid the tremendous heat of continuum flow, in which air would have moved over shield and ship as part of a wave action.The best they could do was to take the highest possible course that would slow them enough, and this put them into transitional flow, which vacillated between free molecular and continuum flow, making for a bumpy ride.And there lay the danger.If they were to hit a high pressure cell in the Martian atmosphere, where heat or vibration or g forces caused some sensitive mechanism to break, then they could be cast into one of Arkadys nightmares at the very time they were crushed in their chairs, weighing 400 pounds apiece, which was something Arkady had never been able to simulate very well.In the real world, Maya thought grimly, at the moment when they were most vulnerable to danger, they were also most helpless to deal with it.But as fate would have it, Martian stratospheric weather was stable, and they remained on the Mantra Run which in actuality turned out to be a roaring, shuddering, breath robbing eight minutes.No hour Maya could remember had lasted as long.Sensors showed that the main heat shield had risen to 600 degrees Kelvin  And then the vibration stopped.The roar ended.They had skipped out of the atmosphere, after skidding around a quarter of the planet.They had decelerated by some 20,000 kilometers an hour, and the heat shields temperature had risen to 710 degrees Kelvin, very near its limit.But the method had worked.All was still.They floated, weightless again, held down by their chair straps.It felt as if they had stopped moving entirely, as if they were floating in pure silence.Unsteadily they unstrapped themselves, floated like ghosts around the cool air of the rooms, an airy faint roaring sounding in their ears, emphasizing the silence.They were talking too loudly, shaking each others hands.Maya felt dazed, and she couldnt understand what people were saying to her, not because she couldnt hear them, but because she wasnt paying attention.Twelve weightless hours later their new course led them to a periapsis 35,000 kilometers from Mars.There they fired the main rockets for a brief thrust, increasing their speed by about a hundred kilometers an hour; after that they were pulled toward Mars again, carving an ellipse that would bring them back to within 500 kilometers of the surface.They were in Martian orbit.Each elliptical orbit of the planet took around a day.Over the next two months, the computers would control burns that would gradually circularize their course just inside the orbit of Phobos.But the landing parties were going to descend to the surface well before that, while perigee was so close.They moved the heat shields back to their storage positions, and went inside the bubble dome to have a look.During perigee Mars filled most of the sky, as if they flew over it in a high jet.The depth of Valles Marineris was perceptible, the height of the four big volcanoes obvious: their broad peaks appeared over the horizon well before the surrounding countryside came into view.There were craters everywhere on the surface.Their round interiors were a vivid sandy orange, a slightly lighter color than the surrounding countryside.Dust, presumably.The short rugged curved mountain ranges were darker than the surrounding countryside, a rust color broken by black shadows.But both the light and dark colors were just a shade away from the omnipresent rusty orangish red, which was the color of every peak, crater, canyon, dune, and even the curved slice of the dust filled atmosphere, visible high above the bright curve of the planet.Red Mars!It was transfixing, mesmerizing.Everyone felt it.They spent long hours working, and at last it was real work.The ship had to be partially disassembled.The main body would be eventually parked in orbit near Phobos, and used as an emergency return vehicle.But twenty tanks from the outer lengths of the hub shaft had only to be disconnected from the Ares and prepped to become planetary landing vehicles, which would take the colonists down in groups of five.The first lander was scheduled to descend as soon as it was decoupled and prepped, so they worked in round the clock shifts, spending a lot of time in EVA.They pulled in to the dining halls tired and ravenous, and conversations were loud; the ennui of the voyage seemed forgotten.One night Maya floated in the bathroom getting ready for bed, feeling stiffened muscles that she hadnt heard from in months.Around her Nadia and Sasha and Yeli Zudov were chattering away, and in the warm wash of voluble Russian it suddenly occurred to her that everyone was happy they were in the last moment of their anticipation, an anticipation that had lain in their hearts for half a lifetime, or ever since childhood and now suddenly it had bloomed below them like a childs crayon drawing of Mars, growing huge then small, huge then small, and as it yo yoed back and forth it loomed before them in all its immense potential: tabula rasa, blank slate.A blank red slate.Anything was possible, anything could happen in that sense they were, in just these last few days, perfectly free.Free of the past, free of the future, weightless in their own warm air, floating like spirits about to invest a material world.In the mirror Maya caught sight of the toothbrush distorted grin on her face, and grabbed a railing to hold her position.It occurred to her that they might never be so happy again.Beauty was the promise of happiness, not happiness itself; and the anticipated world was often more rich than anything real.But this time who could say?This time might be the golden one at last.She released the railing and spit toothpaste into a wastewater bag, then floated backward into the hallway.Come what may, they had reached their goal.They had earned at least the chance to try.Disassembling the Ares made a lot of them feel odd.It was, as John remarked, like dismantling a town and flinging the houses in different directions.And this was the only town they had.Under the giant eye of Mars, all their disagreements became taut; clearly it was critical now, there was little time left.People argued, in the open or under the surface.So many little groups now, keeping their own counsel What had happened to that brief moment of happiness?Maya blamed it mostly on Arkady.He had opened Pandoras box; if not for him and his talk, would the farm group have drawn so close around Hiroko?Would the medical team have kept such close counsel?She didnt think so.She and Frank worked hard to reconcile differences and forge a consensus, to give them the feeling they were still a single team.It involved long conferences with Phyllis and Arkady, Ann and Sax, Houston and Baikonur.In the process a relationship developed between the two leaders that was even more complex than their early encounters in the park, though that was part of it; Maya saw now, in Franks occasional flashes of sarcasm, of resentment, that he had been bothered by the incident more than she had thought at the time.But there was nothing to be done about it now.In the end the Phobos mission was indeed given to Arkady and his friends, mainly because no one else wanted it.Everyone was promised a spot on a geological survey if they wanted one, and Phyllis and Mary and the rest of the Houston crowd were given assurances that the construction of base camp would go according to the plans made in Houston.They intended to work at the base to see that it happened that way.Fine, fine, Frank snarled at the end of one of these meetings.Were all going to be on Mars, do we really have to fight like this over what were going to do there?Thats life, Arkady said cheerfully.On Mars or not, life goes on.Franks jaw was clenched.I came here to get away from this kind of thing!Arkady shook his head.You certainly did not!This is your life, Frank.What would you do without it?One night shortly before the descent, they gathered and had a formal dinner for the entire hundred.Most of the food was farm grown: pasta, salad, and bread, with red wine from storage, saved for a special occasion.Over a dessert of strawberries, Arkady floated up to propose a toast.To the new world we now create!A chorus of groans and cheers; by now they all knew what he meant.Phyllis threw down a strawberry and said, Look, Arkady, this settlement is a scientific station.Your ideas are irrelevant to it.Maybe in fifty or a hundred years.But for now, its going to be like the stations in Antarctica.Thats true, Arkady said.But in fact Antarctic stations are very political.Most of them were built so that the countries that built them would have a say in the revision of the Antarctic treaty.And now the stations are governed by laws set by that treaty, which was made by a very political process!So you see, you cannot just stick your head in the sand crying I am a scientist, I am a scientist!He put a hand to his forehead, in the universal gesture mocking the prima donna.No.When you say that, you are only saying, I do not wish to think about complex systems!Which is not really worthy of true scientists, is it?The Antarctic is governed by a treaty because no one lives there except in scientific stations, Maya said irritably.To have their final dinner, their last moment of freedom, disrupted like this!True, Arkady said.But think of the result.In Antarctica, no one can own land.No one country or organization can exploit the continents natural resources without the consent of every other country.No one can claim to own those resources, or take them and sell them to other people, so that some profit from them while others pay for their use.Dont you see how radically different that is from the way the rest of the world is run?And this is the last area on Earth to be organized, to be given a set of laws.It represents what all governments working together feel instinctively is fair, revealed on land free from claims of sovereignty, or really from any history at all.It is, to say it plainly, Earths best attempt to create just property laws!Do you see?This is the way the entire world should be run, if only we could free it from the straitjacket of history!Sax Russell, blinking mildly, said, But Arkady, since Mars is going to be ruled by a treaty based on the old Antarctic one, what are you objecting to?The Outer Space Treaty states that no country can claim land on Mars, no military activities are allowed, and all bases are open to inspection by any country.Also no Martian resources can become the property of a single nation.The U. N.  is supposed to establish an international regime to govern any mining or other exploitation.If anything is ever done along that line, which I doubt will happen, then it is to be shared among all the nations of the world.He turned a palm upward.Isnt that what youre agitating for, already achieved?Its a start, Arkady said.But there are aspects of that treaty you havent mentioned.Bases built on Mars will belong to the countries that build them, for instance.We will be building American and Russian bases, according to this provision of the law.And that puts us right back into the nightmare of Terran law and Terran history.American and Russian businesses will have the right to exploit Mars, as long as the profits are somehow shared by all the nations signing the treaty.This may only involve some sort of percentage paid to the U. N. , in effect no more than a bribe.I dont believe we should acknowledge these provisions for even a moment!Silence followed this remark.Ann Clayborne said, This treaty also says we have to take measures to prevent the disruption of planetary environments, I think is how they put it.Its in Article Seven.That seems to me to expressly forbid the terraforming that so many of you are talking about.I would say that we should ignore that provision as well, Arkady said quickly.Our own well being depends on ignoring it.This view was more popular than his others, and several people said so.But if youre willing to disregard one article, Arkady pointed out, you should be willing to disregard the rest.Right?There was an uncomfortable pause.All these changes will happen inevitably, Sax Russell said with a shrug.Being on Mars will change us in an evolutionary way.Arkady shook his head vehemently, causing him to spin a little in the air over the table.No, no, no, no!History is not evolution!It is a false analogy!Evolution is a matter of environment and chance, acting over millions of years.But history is a matter of environment and choice, acting within lifetimes, and sometimes within years, or months, or days!History is Lamarckian!So that if we choose to establish certain institutions on Mars, there they will be!And if we choose others, there they will be!A wave of his hand encompassed them all, the people seated at the tables, the people floating among the vines: I say we should make those choices ourselves, rather than having them made for us by people back on Earth.By people long dead, really.Phyllis said sharply, You want some kind of communal utopia, and its not possible.I should think Russian history would have taught you something about that.It has, Arkady said.Now I put to use what it has taught me.Advocating an ill defined revolution?Fomenting a crisis situation?Getting everyone upset and at odds with each other?A lot of people nodded at this, but Arkady waved them away.I decline to accept blame for everyones problems at this point in the trip.I have only said what I think, which is my right.If I make some of you uncomfortable, that is your problem.It is because you dont like the implications of what I say, but cant find grounds to deny them.Some of us cant understand what you say, Mary exclaimed.I say only this!Arkady said, staring at her bug eyed.We have come to Mars for good.We are going to make not only our homes and our food, but also our water and the very air we breathe all on a planet that has none of these things.We can do this because we have technology to manipulate matter right down to the molecular level.This is an extraordinary ability, think of it!And yet some of us here can accept transforming the entire physical reality of this planet, without doing a single thing to change our selves, or the way we live.To be twenty first century scientists on Mars, in fact, but at the same time living within nineteenth century social systems, based on seventeenth century ideologies.Its absurd, its crazy, its its he seized his head in his hands, tugged at his hair, roared Its unscientific!And so I say that among all the many things we transform on Mars, ourselves and our social reality should be among them.We must terraform not only Mars, but ourselves.No one ventured a rebuttal to that; Arkady at full throttle was pretty much unopposable, and a lot of them were genuinely provoked by what he had said, and needed time to think.Others were simply disgruntled, but unwilling to cause too much of a fuss at this particular dinner, which was supposed to be a celebration.It was easier to roll ones eyes, and drink to the toast.To Mars!To Mars!But as they floated around after finishing dessert, Phyllis was disdainful.First we have to survive, she said.With dissension like this, how good will our chances be?Michel Duval tried to reassure her.A lot of these disagreements are symptoms of the flight.Once on Mars, well pull together.And we have more than just what we brought on the Ares to help us well have what the unmanned landers have brought already, shipments of equipment and food all over the surface and the moons.All thats there for us.The only limit will be our own stamina.And this voyage is part of that its a kind of preparation, a test.If we fail this part, we wont even get to try on Mars.Exactly my point!Phyllis said.We are failing in this.Sax stood, looking bored, and pushed off toward the kitchen.The hall was filled with the seashell roar of many small discussions, some of them acrimonious in tone.A lot of people were angry at Arkady, clearly; and others were angry at them for getting upset.Maya followed Sax into the kitchen.As he cleaned his tray he sighed.People are so emotional.Sometimes it seems like Im stuck in an endless performance of the play No Exit.Thats the one where they cant get out of a little room?He nodded.Where hell is other people.I hope we dont prove the hypothesis.A few days later the landers were ready.They would descend over a period of five days; only the Phobos team would stay in what was left of the Ares, guiding it to its near docking with the little moon.Arkady, Alex, Dmitri, Roger, Samantha, Edvard, Janet, Raul, Marina, Tatiana, and Elena said their farewells, absorbed already in the task at hand, promising to descend as soon as the Phobos station was built.The night before the descent Maya couldnt sleep.Eventually she gave up trying, and pulled herself through the rooms and corridors, up to the hub.Every object was sharp edged with sleeplessness and adrenaline, and every familiarity of the ship was countered or overwhelmed by some alteration, a lashed down stack of boxes or a dead end in a tube.It was as if they had already left the Ares.She looked around at it one last time, drained of emotion.Then she pulled herself through the tight locks, into the landing vehicle she had been assigned to.Might as well wait there.She climbed into her spacesuit, feeling, as she so often did when the real moment came, that she was only going through another simulation.She wondered if she would ever escape that feeling, if being on Mars would be enough to end it.It would be worth it just for that: to make her feel real for once!She settled into her chair.A few sleepless hours later she was joined by Sax, Vlad, Nadia, and Ann.Her companions belted in, and they ran through the check out together.Toggles were flipped, there was a countdown.Their rockets fired.The lander drifted away from the Ares.Its rockets fired again.They fell toward the planet.They hit the top of the atmosphere, and their single trapezoidal window became a blaze of Mars colored air.Maya, vibrating with the craft, stared up at it.She felt tense and unhappy, focused backward rather than forward, thinking of everyone still on the Ares; and it seemed to her that they had failed, that the five of them in the lander were leaving behind a group in disarray.Their best chance for creating some kind of concord had passed, and they had not succeeded; the momentary flash of happiness she had felt while brushing her teeth had been just that, a flash.She had failed, then.They were going their separate ways, splintered by their beliefs, and even after two separate years of enforced togetherness they were, like any other human group, no more than a collection of strangers.The die was cast.Part 3    The Crucible      It formed with the rest of the solar system, around five billion years ago.Thats fifteen million human generations.Rocks banging together in space, and then coming back and holding together, all because of the mysterious force we call gravity.That same mysterious warp in the weft of things caused the pile of rocks, when it was big enough, to crush in on its center, until the heat of the pressure melted the rock.Mars is small but heavy, with a nickel iron core.It is small enough that the interior has cooled faster than Earths; the core no longer spins inside the crust at a different speed, and so Mars has practically no magnetic field.No dynamo left.But one of the last internal flows of the molten core and mantle was in the form of a huge anomalous lumping outward on one side, a shove against the crust wall that formed a continent sized bulge eleven kilometers high, three times as high as the Tibetan plateau is above its surroundings.This bulge caused many other features to appear: a system of radial fractures covering an entire hemisphere, including the largest cracks of all, the Valles Marineris, a lace of canyons that would cover the United States coast to coast.The bulge also caused a number of volcanoes, including three straddling its spine, Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Arsia Mons; and off on its northwest edge, Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the solar system, three times the height of Everest and one hundred times the mass of Mauna Loa, the Earths largest volcano.So the Tharsis Bulge was the most important factor in shaping the surface of Mars.The other major factor was meteor fall.In the Noachian Age, three to four billion years ago, meteors were falling on Mars at a tremendous rate, millions of them, and thousands of them were planetesimals, rocks as big as Vega or Phobos.One of the impacts left behind Hellas Basin, 2,000 kilometers in diameter, the largest obvious crater in the solar system, although Daedalia Planum appears to be the remains of an impact basin 4,500 kilometers across.Those are big; but then there are areologists who believe that the entire northern hemisphere of Mars is an ancient impact basin.These big impacts created explosions so cataclysmic that it is hard to imagine them; ejecta from them ended up on the Earth and the Moon, and as asteroids in Trojan orbits; some areologists think that the Tharsis Bulge started because of the Hellas impact; others believe that Phobos and Deimos are ejecta.And these were only the largest impacts.Smaller stones fell every day, so that the oldest surfaces on Mars are saturated with cratering, the landscape a palimpsest of newer rings obscuring older ones, with no patch of land untouched.And each of these impacts released explosions of heat that melted rock; elements were broken out of their matrix and fired away in the form of hot gases, liquids, new minerals.This and the outgassing from the core produced an atmosphere, and lots of water; there were clouds, storms, rain and snow, glaciers, streams, rivers, lakes, all scouring the land, all leaving unmistakable marks of their passage flood channels, stream beds, shorelines, every kind of hydrologic hieroglyphic.But all that went away.The planet was too small, too far from the sun.The atmosphere froze and fell to the ground.Carbon dioxide sublimed to form a thin new atmosphere, while oxygen bonded to rock and turned it red.The water froze, and over the ages seeped down through the kilometers of meteor broken rock.Eventually this layer of regolith became permeated with ice, and the deepest parts were hot enough to melt the ice; so there were underground seas on Mars.Water always flows downhill, so these aquifers migrated down, slowly seeping, until they pooled behind some stoppage or another, a rib of high bedrock or a frozen soil barrier.Sometimes intense artesian pressures built against these dams; and sometimes a meteor would hit, or a volcano appear, and the dam would burst apart and a whole underground sea would spew over the landscape, in enormous floods, floods ten thousand times the flow of the Mississippi.Eventually, however, the water on the surface would freeze, and sublime away in the ceaseless dry winds, and fall on the poles in every winters fog hood.The polar caps therefore thickened, and their weight drove the ice underground, until the visible ice was only the tip of two world topping lenses of underground permafrost, lenses ten and then a hundred times the visible caps volume.While back down toward the equator, new aquifers were being filled from below, by outgassing from the core.And some of the old aquifers were refilling.And so this slowest of cycles approached its second round.But as the planet was cooling, all of it happened more and more slowly, in a long ritard like a clock winding down.The planet settled into the shape we see.But change never stops: the ceaseless winds carved the land, with dust that grew finer and finer; and the eccentricities of Marss orbit meant that the southern and northern hemispheres traded the cold and warm winters in a cycle of 51,000 years, so that the dry ice cap and the water ice cap reversed poles.Each swing of this pendulum laid down a new stratum of sand, and the troughs of new dunes cut through older layers at an angle, until the sand around the poles lay in a stippled cross hatching, in geometrical patterns like Navajo sand paintings, banding the whole top of the world.The colored sands in their patterns, the fluted and scalloped canyon walls, the volcanoes rising right through the sky, the rubbled rock of the chaotic terrain, the infinity of craters, ringed emblems of the planets beginning...Beautiful, or harsher than that: spare, austere, stripped down, silent, stoic, rocky, changeless.Sublime.The visible language of natures mineral existence.Mineral; not animal, nor vegetable, nor viral.It could have happened but it didnt.There was never any spontaneous generation out of the clays or the sulphuric hot springs; no spore falling out of space, no touch of a god; whatever starts life (for we do not know), it did not happen on Mars.Mars rolled, proof of the otherness of the world, of its stony vitality.And then, one day...She hit the ground with both feet solid, nothing tricky about it, the g familiar from nine months in the Ares; and with the suits weight, not that much different from walking on Earth, as far as she could remember.The sky was a pink shaded with sandy tans, a color richer and more subtle than any in the photos.Look at the sky, Ann was saying, look at the sky.Maya was chattering away, Sax and Vlad spun like rotating statues.Nadezhda Francine Cherneshevsky took a few more steps, felt her boots crunch the surface.It was salt hardened sand a couple of centimeters thick, which cracked when you walked on it; the geologists called it duricrust or caliche.Her boot tracks were surrounded by small systems of radial fractures.She was out away from the lander.The ground was a dark rusty orange, covered with an even litter of rocks the same color, although some of the rocks showed tints of red or black or yellow.To the east stood a number of rocket landing vehicles, each one a different shape and size, with the tops of more sticking over the eastern horizon.All of them were crusted the same red orange as the ground: it was an odd, thrilling sight, as if they had stumbled upon a long abandoned alien spaceport.Parts of Baikonur would look like this, in a million years.She walked to one of the nearest landing vehicles, a freight container the size of a small house, set on a skeletal four legged rocket assembly.It looked like it had been there for decades.The sun was overhead, too bright to look at even through her faceplate.It was hard to judge through the polarization and other filters, but it seemed to her that the daylight was much like that on Earth, as far as she could remember.A bright winters day.She looked around again, trying to take it in.They stood on a gently bumpy plain, covered with small sharp edged rocks, all half buried in dust.Back to the west the horizon was marked by a small flat topped hill.It might be a crater rim, it was hard to say.Ann was already halfway there, still quite a large figure; the horizon was closer than seemed right, and Nadia paused to take note of that, suspecting that she would soon become accustomed to it, and never notice.But it was not Earthlike, that strangely close horizon, she saw that clearly now.They stood on a smaller planet.She made a concerted effort to recall Earths gravity, wondering that it should be so hard.Walking in the woods, over tundra, on the river ice in winter ...and now: step, step.The ground was flat, but one had to thread a course between the ubiquitous rocks; there was no place on Earth that she knew of where they were distributed so copiously and evenly.Take a jump!She did, and laughed; even with her suit on she could tell she was lighter.She was just as strong as ever, but weighed only thirty kilos!And the forty kilos of the suit ...well, it threw her off balance, that was true.It made her feel that she had gone hollow.That was it: her center of gravity was gone, her weight had been shifted out to her skin, to the outside of her muscles rather than the inside.That was the effect of the suit, of course.Inside the habitats it would be as it had been in the Ares.But out here in a suit, she was the hollow woman.With the aid of that image she could suddenly move more easily, hop over a boulder, come down and take a turn, dance!Simply pop in the air, dance, land on top of a flat rock watch out  She tumbled, landed on a knee and both hands.Her gloves broke through the duricrust.It felt like a layer of caked sand at the beach, only harder and more brittle.Like hardened mud.And cold!Their gloves werent heated the way their boot soles were, and there wasnt enough insulation when actually touching the ground.It was like touching ice with the bare fingers, wow!Around 215 degrees Kelvin, she recalled, or minus 90 degrees Centigrade; colder than Antarctica, colder than Siberia at its worst.Her fingertips were numb.They would need better gloves to be able to work, gloves fitted with heating elements like their boot soles.That would make the gloves thicker and less flexible.Shed have to get her finger muscles back into shape.She had been laughing.She stood and walked to another freight drop, humming Royal Garden Blues.She climbed the leg of the next drop and rubbed the crust of red dirt off an engraved manifest on the side of the big metal crate.One John Deere/Volvo Martian bulldozer, hydrazine powered, thermally protected, semiautonomous, fully programmable.Prostheses and spare parts included.She felt her face stretched in a big grin.Backhoes, front loaders, bulldozers, tractors, graders, dump trucks, construction supplies and materials of every kind; air miners to filter and collect chemicals from the atmosphere; little factories to render these chemicals into other chemicals; other factories to combine those chemicals; a whole commissary, everything they were going to need, all at hand in scores of crates scattered over the plain.She began to hop from one lander to the next, taking stock.Some of them had obviously hit hard, some had their spider legs collapsed, others their bodies cracked, one was even flattened into a pile of smashed boxes, half buried in dust; but these were just another kind of opportunity, the salvage and repair game, one of her favorites!She laughed aloud, she was a bit giddy, she noticed the comm light on her wrist console blinking; she switched to the common band and was startled by Maya and Vlad and Sax all talking at once, Wheres Ann, you women get back here, hey Nadia, come help us get this damned habitat online, we cant even get the door open!She laughed.The habitats were scattered like everything else, but they had landed near one that they knew was functional; it had been turned on from orbit some days before, and run through a complete check.Unfortunately the outer lock door could not be included in the check, and it was stuck.Nadia went to work on it, grinning ; it was odd to see what looked like a derelict trailer home sporting a space station lock door.It only took a minute for her to get it open, by tapping out the emergency open code while pulling out on the door.Stuck with cold, differential shrinking perhaps.They were going to have a lot of little problems like that.Then she and Vlad were into the lock, and then inside the habitat.It still looked like a trailer home, but with the latest in kitchen fixtures.All the lights were on.The air was warm, and circulating well.The control panel looked like a nuclear power plants.While the others came inside, Nadia walked down a row of small rooms, through door after door, and the oddest feeling suddenly came over her: things seemed out of place.The lights were on, some of them blinking; and down at the far end of the hall, a door was swinging slightly back and forth on its hinges.Obviously the ventilation.And the shock of the habitats landing probably had disarranged things slightly.She shook off the feeling, and went back to greet the others.By the time everyone had landed and walked across the stony plain (stopping, stumbling, running, staring off at the horizon, spinning slowly, walking again), and had entered into the three functioning habitats, and gotten out of their EVA suits, and put them away, and checked out the habitats, and eaten a bit, talking it all over the whole while, night had fallen.They continued working on the habitats and talking through most of that night, too excited to fall asleep; then most of them slept in snatches until dawn, when they woke and suited up and went out again, looking around and checking manifests and running machines through checks.Eventually they noticed they were famished, and went back in to jam down a quick meal and then it was night again!And that was what it was like, for several days: a wild swirl of time passing.Nadia would wake to the bip of her wrist console, and eat a quick breakfast looking out the habitats little east window.Dawn stained the sky rich berry colors for a few minutes, before shifting rapidly through a series of rosy tones to the thick pink orange of daytime.All over the floor of the habitat her companions slept, on mattresses that would fold up against the wall during the day.The walls were beige, tinted orange by the dawn.The kitchen and living room were tiny, the four toilet rooms no more than closets.Ann would stir as the room lightened, and go to one of the four toilets.John was already in the kitchen, moving around quietly.Conditions were so much more crowded and public than they had been on the Ares that some of them were having trouble adjusting; every night Maya complained she couldnt sleep in such a crowd, but there she was, mouth open girlishly.She would be the last to rise, snoozing through the noise and bustle of the others morning routines.Then the sun would crack the horizon, and Nadia would be done with her cereal and milk, the milk made of powder mixed with water mined from the atmosphere (it tasted just the same); and it was time to get into her walker, and out to work.The walkers were designed for the Martian surface, and were not pressurized like spacesuits, but were rather made of an elastic mesh, which held in the body at about the same pressure that the Terran atmosphere would have.This prevented the severe expansion bruising that would result if skin were exposed to Marss minimal atmosphere, but it gave the wearer a lot more freedom of movement than a pressurized spacesuit would have.Walkers also had the very significant advantage of being fail operational; only the hard helmet was airtight, so if you ripped a hole at knee or elbow you would have a badly bruised and frozen patch of skin, but would not suffocate and die within minutes.Getting into a walker, however, was a workout in itself.Nadia wriggled the pants over her long underwear, then got in the jacket and zipped the two sections of the suit together.After that she jammed into big thermal boots, and locked their top rings to the suits ankle rings; pulled on gloves, and locked the wrist rings; put on a fairly standard hard helmet, and locked it to the suits neck ring; then shouldered into an airtank backpack, and linked its air tubes to her helmet.She breathed hard a few times, tasting the cool oxygen nitrogen in her face.The walkers wristpad indicated that all the seals were good, and she followed John and Samantha into the lock.They closed the inner door; the air was sucked back into containers, and John unlocked the outer door.The three of them stepped outside.It was a thrill every morning to step out onto that rocky plain, with the early morning sun casting long black shadows to the west, and the various small knolls and hollows revealed clearly.There was usually a wind from the south, and loose fines moved in a sinuous flow over the ground, so that the rocks sometimes seemed to creep.Even the strongest of these winds could scarcely be felt against an outstretched hand, but they hadnt yet experienced one of the storm winds; at 500 kilometers per hour they were pretty sure to feel something.At twenty, nearly nothing.Nadia and Samantha walked over to one of the little rovers they had uncrated and climbed in.Nadia drove the rover across the plain to a tractor they had found the day before, about a kilometer to the west.The morning cold cut through her walker in a diamond pattern, as the result of the X weave of the heating filaments in the suit material.A strange sensation, but she had been colder in Siberia many a time, and she had no complaints.They came to the big lander and got out.Nadia picked up a drill with a Phillips screwdriver bit, and started dismantling the crate on top of the vehicle.The tractor inside the landers crate was a Mercedes Benz.She poked the drill into the head of a screw, pulled the trigger and watched the screw spin out.She picked up the screw and moved to the next, grinning.Innumerable times in her youth she had gone out in cold like this, with numb white chopped up hands, and fought titanic battles to unscrew frozen or stripped screws ...but here it was ziiip, another one out.And really with the walker it was warmer than it had been in Siberia, and freer than in space, the walker no more restrictive than a thin stiff wetsuit.Red rocks were scattered all around in their uncanny regularity; voices chattered on the common band: Hey, I found those solar panels!You think thats something, I just found the goddamn nuclear reactor.Yes, it was a great morning on Mars.The stacked crate walls made a ramp to drive the tractor off the lander.They didnt look strong enough, but that was the gravity again.Nadia had turned on the tractors heating system as soon as she could reach it, and now she climbed into the cab and tapped a command into its autopilot, feeling that it would be best to let the thing descend the ramp on its own, with her and Samantha watching from the side, just in case the ramp was more brittle in the cold than expected, or otherwise unreliable.She still found it almost impossible to think in terms of Martian g, to trust the designs that took it into account.The ramp just looked too flimsy!But the tractor rolled down without incident, and stopped on the ground: eight meters long, royal blue, with wire mesh wheels taller than they were.They had to climb a short ladder into the cab.The crane prosthesis was already attached to the mount on the front end, and that made it easy to load the tractor with the winch, the sandbagger, the boxes of spare parts, and finally the crate walls.When they were done, the tractor looked as overloaded and topheavy as a steam calliope; but the g made it only a matter of balance.The tractor itself was a real pig, with 600 horsepower, a wide wheelbase, and wheels big as tracks.The hydrazine motor had pickup even worse than diesel, but it was like the ultimate first gear, completely inexorable.They took off and rolled slowly toward the trailer park and there she was, Nadezhda Cherneshevsky, driving a Mercedes Benz across Mars!She followed Samantha to the sorting lot, feeling like a queen.And that was the morning.Back into the habitat, helmet and tank off, a quick bite in walker and boots.With all that running around they were famished.After lunch they went back out in the Mercedes Benz, and used it to haul a Boeing air miner to an area east of the habitats, where they were going to gather all the factories.The air miners were big metal cylinders, somewhat resembling 737 fuselages except that they had eight massive sets of landing gear, and rocket engines attached vertically to their sides, and two jet engines mounted above the fuselage fore and aft.Five of these miners had been dropped in the area some two years before.In the time since, their jet engines had been sucking in the thin air and ramming it through a sequence of separating mechanisms, to divide it into its component gases.The gases had been compressed and stored in big tanks, and were now available for use.So the Boeings each now held 5,000 liters of water ice, 3,000 liters of liquid oxygen, 3,000 liters of liquid nitrogen, 500 liters of argon, and 400 liters of carbon dioxide.It was no easy task hauling these giants across the rubble to the big holding tanks near their habitats, but they needed to do it, because after they were drained into the holding tanks they could be turned on again.Just that afternoon another group had gotten one emptied out and turned back on, and the low hum of its jets could be heard everywhere, even in a helmet or a habitat.Nadia and Samanthas miner was more stubborn.In the whole afternoon they only managed to haul it a hundred meters, and they had to use the bulldozer attachment to scrape a rough road for it all the way.Just before sunset they returned through the lock into the habitat, their hands cold and aching with fatigue.They stripped down to their dust caked underwear and went straight to the kitchen, ravenous once more; Vlad estimated they were each burning about 6,000 calories a day.They cooked and gulped down rehydrated pasta, nearly scalding their partially thawed fingers on their trays.Only when they had finished eating did they go to the womens changing room and start trying to clean themselves up, sponging down with hot water, changing into clean jumpers.Its going to be hard to keep our clothes clean, that dust even gets through the wrist locks, and the waist zippers are like open holes.Well yeah, those fines are micron sized!Were going to have worse trouble from it than dirty clothes, I can tell you that.Its going to be getting into everything, our lungs, our blood, our brains.Thats life on Mars.This was already a popular refrain, used whenever they encountered a problem, especially an intractable one.On some days after dinner there were a couple hours of sunlight left, and Nadia, restless, would sometimes go back outside.Often she spent the time wandering around the crates that had been hauled to base that day, and over time she assembled a personal tool kit, feeling like a kid in a candy store.Years in the Siberian power industry had given her a reverence for good tools, she had suffered brutally from the lack of them.Everything in north Yakut had been built on permafrost, and the platforms sank unevenly in the summer, and were buried in ice in the winter, and parts for construction had come from all over the world, heavy machinery from Switzerland and Sweden, drills from America, reactors from the Ukraine, plus a lot of old scavenged Soviet stuff, some of it good, some indescribably shoddy, but all of it unmatched some of it even built in inches so that they had had to improvise constantly, building oil wells out of ice and string, knocking together nuclear reactors that made Chernobyl look like a Swiss watch.And every desperate days work accomplished with a collection of tools that would have made a tinker weep.Now she could wander in the dim ruby light of sunset, her old jazz collection piped from the habitat stereo into her helmet headphones, as she rooted in supply boxes and picked out any tool she wanted.She would carry them back to a small room she had commandeered in one of the storage warehouses, whistling along with King Olivers Creole Jazz Band, adding to a collection that included, among other items, an Allen wrench set, some pliers, a power drill, several clamps, some hacksaws, an impact wrench set, a brace of cold tolerant bungie cords, assorted files and rasps and planes, a crescent wrench set, a crimper, five hammers, some hemostats, three hydraulic jacks, a bellows, several sets of screwdrivers, drills and bits, a portable compressed gas cylinder, a box of plastic explosives and shape charges, a tape measure, a giant Swiss Army knife, tin snips, tongs, tweezers, three vises, a wire stripper, X acto knives, a pick, a bunch of mallets, a nut driver set, hose clamps, a set of end mills, a set of jewelers screwdrivers, a magnifying glass, all kinds of tape, a plumbers bob and ream, a sewing kit, scissors, sieves, a lathe, levels of all sizes, long nosed pliers, vise grip pliers, a tap and die set, three shovels, a compressor, a generator, a welding and cutting set, a wheelbarrow  and so on.And this was just the mechanical equipment, her carpenters tools.In other parts of the warehouse they were stockpiling research and lab equipment, geological tools, and any number of computers and radios and telescopes and videocameras; and the biosphere team had warehouses of equipment to set up the farm, the waste recyclers, the gas exchange mechanism, in essence their whole infrastructure; and the medical team had more warehouses of supplies for the clinic, and their research labs, and the genetic engineering facility.You know what this is, Nadia said to Sax Russell one evening looking around her warehouse, It is an entire town, disassembled and lying in pieces.And a very prosperous town at that.Yes, a university town.With first rate departments in several sciences.But still in pieces.Yes.But I kind of like it that way.Sunset was mandatory return to habitat time, and in the dusk she would stumble into the lock and inside, and eat another small cold meal sitting on her bed, listening to the talk around her which mostly concerned the days work, and the arrangement of the tasks for the next morning.Frank and Maya were supposed to be doing this, but in fact it was happening spontaneously, in a kind of ad hoc barter system.Hiroko was particularly good at it, which was a surprise given how withdrawn she had been on the voyage out; but now that she needed help from outside her team, she spent most of every evening moving from person to person, so single minded and persuasive that she usually had a sizable crew working on the farm every morning.Nadia couldnt really see this; they had five years of dehydrated and canned food on hand, fare that suited Nadia fine, she had eaten worse for most of her life and she paid little attention to food anymore, she might as well have been eating hay, or refueling like one of the tractors.But they did need the farm for growing bamboo, which Nadia planned to use as a construction material in the permanent habitat that she hoped to start building soon.It all interlocked; all their tasks linked together, were necessary to each other.So when Hiroko plopped down beside her, she said, Yeah, yeah, be there at eight.But you cant build the permanent farm until the base habitat itself is built.So really you ought to be helping me tomorrow, right?No, no, Hiroko said, laughing.Day after, okay?Hirokos main competition for labor came from Sax Russell and his crowd, who were working to start all the factories.Vlad and Ursula and the biomed group were also hungry to get all their labs set up and running.These three teams seemed willing to live in the trailer park indefinitely, as long as their own projects were progressing, but luckily there were a lot of people who were not so obsessed by their work, people like Maya and John and the rest of the cosmonauts, who were interested in moving into larger and better protected quarters as soon as possible.So Nadias project would get help from them.When she was done eating, Nadia took her tray into the kitchen and cleaned it with a little swab, then went over to sit by Ann Clayborne and Simon Frazier and the rest of the geologists.Ann looked nearly asleep; she was spending her mornings taking long rover trips and hikes, and then working hard on the base all afternoon, trying to make up for her trips away.To Nadia she seemed strangely tense, less happy about being on Mars than one would have thought.She appeared unwilling to work on the factories, or for Hiroko; indeed she usually came to work for Nadia, who, since she was only trying to build housing, could be said to be impacting the planet less than the more ambitious teams.Maybe that was it, maybe not; Ann wasnt saying.She was hard to know, moody not in Mayas extravagant Russian manner, but more subtly, and, Nadia thought, in a darker register.In Bessie Smith land.All around them people cleaned up after dinner and talked, and looked over manifests and talked, and washed clothes and talked, until most were stretched out on their beds, talking in lower voices, until they passed out.Its like the first second of the universe, Sax Russell observed, rubbing his face wearily.All crammed together and no differentiation.Just a bunch of hot particles rushing about.And that was just one day; and that was what it was like every day, for day after day after day.No change in the weather to speak of, except occasionally a wisp of cloud, or an extra windy afternoon.In the main, the days rolled by one like the next.Everything took longer than planned.Just getting into the walkers and out of the habitats was a chore, and then all the equipment had to be warmed; and even though it had been built to a uniform set of standards, the international nature of the equipment meant that there were inevitable mismatches of size and function; and the dust (Dont call it dust!Ann would complain.Thats like calling dust gravel!Call it fines, theyre fines!)got into everything; and all the physical work in the penetrating cold was exhausting, so that they went slower than they thought they would, and began to collect a number of minor injuries.And, finally, there was just an amazing number of things to do, some of which had never even occurred to them.It took them about a month, for instance (they had budgeted ten days) just to open all the freight loads, check their contents, and move them into the appropriate stockpiles to get to the point where they could really begin to work.After that, they could begin to build in earnest.And here Nadia came into her own.She had had nothing to do on the Ares, it had been a kind of hibernation for her.But building things was her great talent, the nature of her genius, trained in the bitter school of Siberia.Very quickly she became the colonys chief troubleshooter, the universal solvent as John called her.Almost every job they had benefited from her help, and as she ran around every day answering questions and giving advice, she blossomed into a kind of timeless work heaven.So much to do!So much to do!Every night in the planning sessions Hiroko worked her wiles, and the farm went up: three parallel rows of greenhouses, looking like commercial greenhouses back on Earth except smaller and very thick walled, to keep them from exploding like party balloons.Even with interior pressures of only 300 millibars, which was barely farmable, the differential with the outside was drastic; a bad seal or a weak spot and they would go bang.But Nadia was good at cold weather seals, and so Hiroko was calling her in a panic every other day.Then the materials scientists needed help getting their factories operational, and the crew assembling the nuclear reactor wanted her supervision for every breath that they took, they were petrified with fright that they would do something wrong, and were not reassured by Arkady sending radio messages down from Phobos insisting they did not need such a dangerous technology, that they could get all the power they needed from wind generation.He and Phyllis had bitter arguments about this.It was Hiroko who cut Arkady off, with what she said was a Japanese commonplace: Shikata ga nai, meaning there is no other choice.Windmills might have generated enough power, as Arkady contended, but they didnt have windmills, while they had been supplied with a Rickover nuclear reactor, built by the U. S.  Navy and a beautiful piece of work; and no one wanted to try bootstrapping themselves into a wind powered system, they were in too much of a hurry.Shikata ga nai.This too became one of their oft repeated phrases.And so every morning the construction crew for Chernobyl (Arkadys name, of course) begged Nadia to come out with them and supervise.They had been exiled far to the east of the settlement, so that it made sense to go out for a full day with them.But then the medical team wanted her help building a clinic and some labs inside, from some discarded freight crates that they were converting into shelters.So instead of staying out at Chernobyl she would go back midday to eat, and then help the med team.Every night she passed out exhausted.Some evenings before she did, she had long talks with Arkady, up on Phobos.His crew was having trouble with the moons microgravity, and he wanted her advice as well.If only we could get into some g just to live, to sleep!Arkady said.Build train tracks in a ring around the surface, Nadia suggested out of a doze.Make one of the tanks from the Ares into a train, and run it around the track.Get on board and run the train around fast enough to give you some g against the ceiling of the train.Static, then Arkadys wild cackle.Nadezhda Francine, I love you, I love you!You love gravity.With all this advisory work, the construction of their permanent habitat went slowly indeed.It was only once a week or so that Nadia could climb into the open cab of a Mercedes and rumble over the torn ground to the end of the trench she had started.At this point it was ten meters wide, fifty long, and four deep, which was as deep as she wanted to go.The bottom of the trench was the same as the surface: clay, fines, rocks of all sizes.Regolith.While she worked with the bulldozer the geologists hopped in and out of the hole, taking samples and looking around, even Ann who did not like the way they were ripping up the area; but no geologist ever born could keep away from a land cut.Nadia listened to their conversation band as she worked.They figured the regolith was probably much the same all the way down to bedrock, which was too bad; regolith was not Nadias idea of good ground.At least its water content was low, less than a tenth of a percent, which meant they wouldnt get much slumping under a foundation, one of the constant nightmares of Siberian construction.When she got the regolith cut right, she was going to lay a foundation of Portland cement, the best concrete they could make with the materials at hand.It would crack unless they poured it two meters thick, but shikata ga nai.The thickness would provide some insulation.But she would have to box the mud and heat it to get it to cure; it wouldnt below 13 degrees Centigrade, so that meant heating elements.Slow, slow, everything was slow.She drove the dozer forward to lengthen the trench, and it bit the ground and bucked.Then the weight of the thing told, and the scoop cut through the regolith and plowed forward.What a pig, Nadia said to the vehicle fondly.Nadias in love with a bulldozer, Maya said over their band.At least I know who Im in love with, Nadia mouthed.She had spent too many of the evenings of the last week out in the toolshed with Maya, listening to her rattle away about her problems with John, about how she really got along in most ways better with Frank, about how she couldnt decide what she felt, and was sure Frank hated her now, etc.etc.etc.Cleaning tools Nadia had said Da, da, da, trying to hide her lack of interest.The truth was she was tired of Mayas problems, and would rather have discussed building materials, or almost anything else.A call from the Chernobyl crew interrupted her bulldozing.Nadia, how can we get cement this thick to set in the cold?Heat it.We are!Heat it more.Oh!They were almost done out there, Nadia judged; the Rickover had been mostly preassembled, it was a matter of putting the forms together, fitting in the steel containment tank, filling the pipes with water (which dropped their supply to nearly nothing), wiring it all up, piling sandbags around it all, and pulling the control rods.After that they would have 300 kilowatts on hand, which would put an end to the nightly argument over who got the lions share of generator power the next day.There was a call from Sax.One of the Sabatier processors had clogged, and they couldnt get the housing off it.So Nadia left the bulldozing to John and Maya, and took a rover to the factory complex to have a look.Im off to see the alchemists, she said.Have you ever noticed how much the machinery here reflects the character of the industry that built it?Sax remarked to Nadia as she arrived and went to work on the Sabatier.If it was built by car companies, its low powered but reliable.If it was built by the aerospace industry, its outrageously high powered but breaks down twice a day.And partnership products are horribly designed, Nadia said.Right.And chemical equipment is finicky, Spencer Jackson added.Ill say.Especially in this dust.The Boeing air miners had been only the start of the factory complex; their gases were fed into big boxy trailers to be compressed and expanded and rendered and recombined, using chemical engineering operations such as dehumidification, liquefaction, fractional distillation, electrolysis, electrosynthesis, the Sabatier process, the Raschig process, the Oswald process....Slowly they worked up more and more complex chemicals, which flowed from one factory to the next, through a warren of structures that looked like mobile homes caught in a web of color coded tanks and pipes and tubes and cables.Spencers current favorite product was magnesium, which was plentiful; they were getting twenty five kilos of it from every cubic meter of regolith, he said, and it was so light in Martian g that a big bar of it felt like a piece of plastic.Its too brittle when pure, Spencer said, but if we alloy it just a bit well have an extremely light and strong metal.Martian steel, Nadia said.Better than that.So, alchemy; but with finicky machines.Nadia found the Sabatiers problem, and went to work fixing a broken vacuum pump.It was amazing how much of the factory complex came down to pumps, sometimes it seemed nothing but a mad assemblage of them, and by their nature they kept clogging with fines and breaking down.Two hours later the Sabatier was fixed.On the way back to the trailer park, Nadia glanced into the first greenhouse.Plants were already blooming, the new crops breaking out of their beds of new black soil.Green glowed intensely in the reds of this world, it was a pleasure to see it.The bamboo was growing several centimeters a day, she had been told, and the crop was already nearly five meters tall.It was easy to see they were going to need more soil.Back at the alchemists they were using nitrogen from the Boeings to synthesize ammonia fertilizers; Hiroko craved these because the regolith was an agricultural nightmare, intensely salty, explosive with peroxides, extremely arid, and completely without biomass.They were going to have to construct soil just like they had the magnesium bars.Nadia went into her habitat in the trailer park for a standing lunch.Then she was out again, to the site of the permanent habitat.The floor of the trench had been almost leveled in her absence.She stood on the edge of the hole, looking down in it.They were going to build to a design that she liked tremendously, one she had worked on herself in Antarctica and on the Ares: a simple line of barrel vaulted chambers, sharing adjacent walls.By setting them in the trench the chambers would be half buried to begin with; then when completed they would be covered by ten meters of sandbagged regolith, to stop radiation and also, because they planned to pressurize to 450 millibars, to keep the buildings from exploding.Local materials were all they needed for the exteriors of these buildings: Portland cement and bricks were it, basically, with plastic liner in some places to insure the seal.Unfortunately the brickmakers were having some trouble, and they gave Nadia a call.Nadias patience was running short, and she groaned.We travel all the way to Mars and you cant make bricks?Its not that we cant make bricks, said Gene.Its just that I dont like them.The brickmaking factory mixed clays and sulphur extracted from the regolith, and this preparation was poured into brick molds, and baked until the sulphur began to polymerize, and then as the bricks cooled they were compressed a bit in another part of the machine.The resulting blackish red bricks had a tensile strength that was technically adequate for use in the barrel vaults, but Gene wasnt happy.We dont want to be at minimum values for heavy roofs over our heads, he said.What if we pile one too many sandbag on top of it, or if we get a little marsquake?I dont like it.After some thought Nadia said, Add nylon.What?Go out and find the parachutes from the freight drops, and shred them real fine, and add them to the clay.Thatll help their tensile strength.Very true, Gene said, after a pause.Good idea!Think we can find the parachutes?They must be east of here somewhere.So they had finally found a job for the geologists that actually helped the construction effort.Ann and Simon and Phyllis and Sasha and Igor drove long distance rovers over the horizon to east of the base, searching and surveying far past Chernobyl, and in the next week they found almost forty parachutes, each one representing a few hundred kilos of useful nylon.One day they came back excited, having reached Ganges Catena, a series of sinkholes in the plain a hundred kilometers to the southeast.It was strange, Igor said, because you cant see them until the last minute, and then theyre like huge funnels, about ten kilometers across and a couple deep, eight or nine in a row, each smaller and shallower.Fantastic.Theyre probably thermokarsts, but theyre so big its hard to believe it.Sasha said, Its nice to see such a distance, after all this near horizon stuff.Theyre thermokarsts, Ann said.But they had drilled and found no water.This was getting to be a concern; they hadnt found any water to speak of in the ground, no matter how far down they drilled.It forced them to rely on the supplies from the air miners.Nadia shrugged.The air miners were pretty tough.She wanted to think about her vaults.The new improved bricks were appearing, and she had started the robots building the walls and roofs.The brick factory filled little robot cars, which rolled like toy rovers across the plain to cranes at the site; the cranes pulled out bricks one by one, and placed them on cold mortar spread by another set of robots.The system worked so well that soon the bottleneck became brick production itself.Nadia would have been pleased, if she had had more faith in the robots.These seemed okay, but her experiences with robots in the years on Novy Mir had made her wary.They were great if everything went perfectly, but nothing ever went perfectly, and it was hard to program them with decision algorithms that didnt either make them so cautious that they froze every minute, or so uncontrolled that they could commit unbelievable acts of stupidity, repeating an error a thousand times and magnifying a small glitch into a giant blunder, as in Mayas emotional life.You got what you put into robots, but even the best were mindless idiots.One evening Maya snagged her out in her tool room and asked her to switch to a private band.Michel is useless, she complained.Im really having a hard time, and he only looks at me like he wants to lick my skin.Youre the only one I trust, Nadia.Yesterday I told Frank that I thought John was trying to undercut his authority in Houston, but that he shouldnt tell anyone I thought so, and the very next day John was asking me why I thought he was bothering Frank.Theres no one who will just listen and stay quiet!Nadia nodded, rolling her eyes.Finally she said, Sorry, Maya, I have to go talk to Hiroko about a leak they cant find.She banged her faceplate lightly against Mayas symbol for a kiss on the cheek and switched to the common band and took off.Enough was enough.It was infinitely more interesting to talk to Hiroko real conversations, about real problems in the real world.Hiroko was asking Nadia for help almost every day, and Nadia liked that, because Hiroko was brilliant, and since landfall had obviously raised her estimate of Nadias abilities.Mutual professional respect, a great maker of friendships.And so nice to talk nothing but business.Hermetic seals, lock mechanisms, thermal engineering, glass polarization, farm/human interfaces (Hirokos talk was always a few steps ahead of the game).These topics were a great relief after all the emotional whispered conferences with Maya, endless sessions about who liked Maya and who didnt like Maya, about how Maya felt about this and that, and who had hurt her feelings that day ...bah.Hiroko was never strange, except when she would say something Nadia didnt know how to deal with, like, Mars will tell us what it wants and then well have to do it.What could you say to something like that?But Hiroko would just smile her big smile, and laugh at Nadias shrug.At night the talk still went everywhere, vehement, absorbed, unself conscious.Dmitri and Samantha were sure that they could soon introduce genetically engineered microorganisms into the regolith that would survive, but they would have to get permission first from the U. N.  Nadia herself found the idea alarming; it made the chemical engineering in the factories look relatively straightforward, more like brickmaking than the dangerous acts of creation Samantha was proposing.Although the alchemists were performing some pretty creative things themselves.Almost every day they came back to the trailer park with samples of new materials: sulphuric acid, sorel cements for the vault mortar, ammonium nitrate explosives, a calcium cyanamide rover fuel, polysulfide rubber, silicon based hyperacids, emulsifying agents, a selection of test tubes holding trace elements extracted from the salts, and, most recently, clear glass.This last was a coup, as earlier attempts at glassmaking had produced only black glass.But stripping silicate feedstocks of their iron content had done the trick, and so one night they sat in the trailer passing around small wavy sheets of glass, the glass itself filled with bubbles and irregularities, like something out of the seventeenth century.When they got the first chamber buried and pressurized, Nadia walked around inside it with her helmet off, sniffing the air.It was pressurized to 450 millibars, the same as the helmets and the trailer park, with an oxygen nitrogen argon mix, and warmed to about 15 degrees Centigrade.It felt great.The chamber had been divided into two stories by a floor of bamboo trunks, set in a slot in the brick wall two and a half meters overhead.The segmented cylinders made a sweet green ceiling, lit by neon tubes hung under them.Against one wall was a magnesium and bamboo staircase, leading through a hole to the upper story.She climbed up to have a look.Split bamboo over the trunks made a fairly flat green floor.The ceiling was brick, rounded and low.Up there they would locate the bedrooms and bathroom; the lower floor would be living room and kitchen.Maya and Simon had already put up wall hangings, made of nylon from the salvaged parachutes.There were no windows; lighting came only from the neon bulbs.Nadia disliked this fact, and in the larger habitat she was already planning, there would be windows in almost every room.But first things first.For the time being these windowless chambers were the best they could do.And a big improvement over the trailer park, after all.As she went back down the stairs she ran her fingers over the bricks and mortar.They were rough, but warm to the touch, heated by elements placed behind them.There were heating elements under the floor as well.She took off her shoes and socks, luxuriating in the feel of the warm rough bricks underfoot.It was a wonderful room; and nice, too, to think that they had gone all the way to Mars, and there built homes out of brick and bamboo.She recalled vaulted ruins she had seen years ago on Crete, at a site called Aptera: underground Roman cisterns, barrel vaulted and made of brick, buried in a hillside.They had been almost the same size as these chambers.Their exact purpose was unknown storage for olive oil, some said, though it would have been an awful lot of oil.Those vaults were intact two thousand years after their construction, and in earthquake country.As Nadia put her boots back on she grinned to think of it.Two thousand years from now, their descendants might walk into this chamber, no doubt a museum by then, if it still existed the first human dwelling built on Mars!And she had done it.Suddenly she felt the eyes of that future on her, and shivered.They were like Cro Magnons in a cave, living a life that was certain to be pored over by the archaeologists of subsequent generations; people like her who would wonder, and wonder, and never quite understand.More time passed, more work got done.
