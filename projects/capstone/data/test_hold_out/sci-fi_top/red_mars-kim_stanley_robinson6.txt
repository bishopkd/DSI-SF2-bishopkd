People often feel quite cold, actually.An hour later a big IV bag had drained into him.He was still hot, and his bladder was full.They let him get up and go to the bathroom, then when he returned he was strapped into what looked like a cross between a couch and an electric chair.That didnt bother him; astronaut training had inured him to all devices.The shock when it came lasted about ten seconds, and felt like a disagreeable tickling everywhere in him.Ursula and the others detached him from the apparatus; Ursula, her eyes twinkling, gave him a kiss full on the mouth.She warned him again that in a while he would start to feel chilled, and that it would last for a couple of days.It was okay to sit in the saunas or whirlpool baths; in fact they recommended it.So he and Maya sat in the corner of a sauna together, huddled in the penetrating warmth, watching the bodies of the other visitors, who came in white and went out pink.It seemed to John an image of what was happening to the two of them come in sixty five, go out ten.He really couldnt believe it.It was still very hard for him to think, he found his thoughts simply blanked, his mind stunned.If brain cells were reinforced too, had his clogged unexpectedly?He had always been a ragged slow thinker.In fact this was probably no more than his usual obtuseness, brought to his attention because he was trying so hard to come to grips with the thing, to think what it meant.Could it really be true?Could they really be sidestepping death for some years, perhaps some decades?...They left the sauna to eat, and after their meals they took short walks in the crest greenhouse, looking out at the dunes to the north, the chaotic lava to the south.The view north reminded Maya of early Underhill, with the random litter of stones on Lunae replaced by Arcadias windswept quilt pattern of dunes, as if her memory had cleaned up her recollections of that time, making them more patterned, tinting their faded ochres and reds to rich lemon yellows.Patination of the past.He stared at her curiously.It had been M 11 years since those first days in the trailer park, and in most of the years since, the two of them had been lovers, with a number of (blessed) interruptions and separations, of course, caused by circumstances or, more usually, their inability to get along.But they had always started again when the opportunities came, and the upshot was that now they knew each other just about as well as any old married couple with a less interrupted history; perhaps even better, because any completely constant couple was likely to have stopped paying attention to each other at some point, while the two of them, with all their separations and reunions, fights and rapprochements, had had to relearn each other countless times.John said some of this to her, and they talked about it it was a pleasure to talk about itWe have had to keep paying attention, Maya said intently, nodding with a look of solemn satisfaction, sure that this was mostly her doing.Yes, they had paid attention, they had never fallen into the mindless rut of habit.Surely, they both agreed as they sat in the baths, or walked the crest, this compensated for the time they had spent apart, more than compensated for it.Yes; no doubt they knew each other even better than any old married couple.And so they talked, trying to stitch their pasts to this strange new future, in the anxious hope that it would not prove to be an unbridgeable rupture.And late the following evening, two days after the inoculation, sitting alone naked in the sauna, their flesh still cold, their skin all rosy with sweat, John looked at Mayas body sitting there beside him, as real as a rock, and he felt a glow like the IV injection running all through him.He had not eaten much since the treatment, and the beige and yellow tiles they sat on had started to throb, as if lit from within; light gleamed on every water droplet covering the tiles, like tiny chips of lightning scattered everywhere, and Mayas body sprawled over these sparkling tiles pulsing before him like a pink candle.The intense thereness of ithaecceity, Sax had called it once, when John had asked him something about his religious beliefs I believe in haecceity, Sax had said, in thisness, in here and nowness, in the particular individuality of every moment.Thats why I want to know what is this?what is this?what is this?Now, remembering Saxs odd word and his odd religion, John finally understood him; because he was feeling the thisness of the moment like a rock in his hand, and it felt as if his entire life had been lived only to get him to this moment.The tiles and the thick hot air were pulsing around him as if he were dying and being reborn, and sure, that was really the case if what Ursula and Vlad said were true.And there beside him in the process of being reborn was the pink body of Maya Toitovna, Mayas body which he knew better than his own.And not only in this moment, but through time; he could recall vividly his first sight of her naked, floating toward him in the bubble chamber on the Ares, surrounded by a nimbus of stars and the black velvet of space.And every change in her since then was perfectly visible to him, the shift from the image in his memory to the body beside him was a hallucinatory time dissolve, her flesh and skin shifting, dropping, lining aging.They were both older, creakier, heavier.That was the way it went.But really the amazing thing was how much had remained, how much they were still themselves.Lines from a poem came to him, the epitaph of the Scott expedition near McMurdo in Antarctica, they had all climbed the hill to see the big wooden cross together, and carved on it had been lines: much has gone yet much remains something like that.He couldnt remember much had gone; it had been a long time ago, after all.But they had worked hard, and eaten well, and perhaps Marss gravity had been kinder than Earths would have been, because the obvious glowing truth was that Maya Toitovna was still a very beautiful woman, strong and muscly, her imperial face and gray wet hair still commanding his gaze, her breasts still magnets to his eye, completely different in appearance if she so much as shifted an elbow, and yet in every position completely familiar to him his breasts, his arms, ribs, flanks.She was, for better and worse, the person he was closest to, a beautiful pink animal and also an avatar for him, of sex, of life itself on this bare rocky world.If this was what they were at sixty five, and if the treatment did no more than hold them at this point, for even a few added years, or (the shock of it still) for decades?For decades?Well, it was astonishing.Absolutely too much to grasp, he had to stop trying or he would strip all the gears of his mind.But could it be?Could it really be?The aching desire of all true lovers through all the ages, to have a bit more time together, to be able to stretch out and live the love fully Similar feelings seemed to be stirring Maya.She was in a great mood, she watched him from hooded eyes, with that come hither half smile he knew so well, one knee up and tucked in her armpit, not flaunting her sex at him but just comfortable, relaxing as she would if she were alone yes, there was nothing like Maya in a good mood, no one could infect other people with it so much and so surely.He felt a rush of affection for that aspect of her character, an IV of sentiment, and he put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed, eros just a spice in a feast of agape, and suddenly as usual the words just burst out of him, he said things to her that he had never said before, Lets get married!he said and when she laughed he did too, and said, No no, I mean it, lets get married.Get married and grow really, really old together, seize whatever gift years came and make them a shared adventure, have kids, watch the kids have kids, watch the grandkids have kids, watch the great grandkids have kids, my Lord who knew how long it might last?They might watch a whole nation of descendants flourish, become patriarch and matriarch, a kind of mini Martian Adam and Eve!And Maya laughed at each declaration, her eyes vivacious and sparkling with affection, windows to a soul in a very, very good mood, watching him and soaking him up, he could feel the blotter tug of her gaze watching him and laughing delightedly at each new absurd hilarious phrase that burst out of him, and saying to him Something like that, yes, something like that, and then hugging him hard.Oh John, she said.You know how to make me happy.You are the best man I ever had.She kissed him and he found that despite the saunas heat it was going to be easy to shift the emphasis from agape to eros; but now the two were one, indistinguishable, a great mingled flood of love.So youll marry me and all?he said as he locked the sauna door and they began to fall into it.Something like that, she said, eyes flashing, face ablaze with an absolutely ravishing smile.When you expect to live another two hundred years, you behave differently from when you expect to live only twenty.This they proved almost immediately.John spent the winter there at Acheron, on the edge of the CO2 fog cap that still descended over the North Pole every winter, studying areobotany with Marina Tokareva and her lab group.He did this on Saxs instruction, and because he felt in no hurry to leave.Sax seemed to have forgotten about the search to find out who the saboteurs were, which made John a little suspicious.In his spare time he still made efforts through Pauline, concentrating on the areas he had been working on before Acheron, travel records mostly, and then employment records of all the people who had traveled to the areas where the sabotages had taken place.Presumably there were a lot of people involved, so individual travel records might not tell him much.But everyone on Mars had been sent there by an organization, and by checking which organizations had sent people to the relevant places, he hoped to get some indications.It was a messy business, and he had to rely on Pauline not only for statistics but advice, which was worrying.The rest of the time he studied a branch of areobotany in which all the payoffs were at least decades away.Why not?He had the time, and might very well see the fruits of the work.So he watched Marinas group design a new tree, studying with them and doing their lab work, washing glassware and the like.The tree was designed to serve as the canopy of a multi layered forest which they hoped to grow on the dunes of Vastitas Borealis.It was based on a sequoia genome, but they wanted trees even bigger than sequoias, perhaps 200 meters tall, with a trunk fifty meters in diameter at the base.Their bark would stay frozen most of the time, and their broad leaves, which would probably look as if they had tobacco leaf disease, were going to be able to absorb the baseline dose of UV radiation without damage to their purplish undersides.At first John thought the trees size was excessive, but Marina pointed out that they would be capable of taking in great quantities of carbon dioxide, fixing the carbon and transpiring the oxygen back into the air.And they were going to be quite a sight, or so they supposed; the actual shoots of the competing test prototypes were only ten meters tall, and it would be twenty years before the winners of the competition reached their mature heights.And right now all the prototypes still died in Mars jars; atmospheric conditions would have to change considerably before they would survive outdoors.Marinas lab was getting ahead of the game.But so was everyone else.This seemed to be a result of the treatment, it made sense on the face of it.Longer experiments.Longer (John groaned) investigations.Longer thoughts.In many respects, however, nothing changed.John felt about the same as before, except it didnt take omegendorph to get an occasional buzz humming through him, as if he had recently finished swimming a couple of kilometers, or cross country skiied for an afternoon, or, yes, taken a dose of omegendorph.Which now would have been carrying coals to Newcastle.Because things glowed.When he took the crest walk, the whole visible world glowed: stilled bulldozers, a crane like a gallows, he could watch anything for minutes on end.Maya left for Hellas, and it didnt matter; their relations were back on the old rollercoaster ride, a lot of bickering and fits of temper on her part, but all that seemed unimportant, floating inside the glow, changing nothing in the way he felt toward her, or in the way she had, from time to time, turned on him that look of hers.He would see her in a few months, and talk to her on screen; meanwhile this was a separation he was not entirely unhappy to see.It was a good winter.He learned a lot about areobotany and bioengineering, and in many of the evenings, after dinner, he would ask the Acheron people both individually and severally what they thought the eventual Martian society should be like, and how it should be run.At Acheron this usually led directly to considerations of ecology, and its deformed offshoot economics; these to them were much more critical than politics, or what Marina called the supposed decision making apparatus.Marina and Vlad were particularly interesting on this topic, as they had worked out a system of equations for what they called eco economics, which always sounded to John like eco economics.He liked listening to them explain the equations, and he asked them a lot of questions, learning about concepts like carrying capacity, coexistence, counteradaptation, legitimacy mechanisms, and ecologic efficiency.Thats the only real measure of our contribution to the system, Vlad would say.If you burn our bodies in a microbomb calorimeter youll find we contain about six or seven kilocalories per gram of weight, and of course we take in a lot of calories to sustain that through our lives.Our output is harder to measure, because its not a matter of predators feeding on us, as in the classic efficiency equations its more a matter of how many calories we create by our efforts, or send on to future generations, something like that.And most of that is very indirect, naturally, and it involves a lot of speculation and subjective judgment.If you dont go ahead and assign values to a number of non physical things, then electricians and plumbers and reactor builders and other infrastructural workers would always rate as the most productive members of society, while artists and the like would be seen as contributing nothing at all.Sounds about right to me, John joked, but Vlad and Marina ignored him.Anyway thats a large part of what economics is people arbitrarily, or as a matter of taste, assigning numerical values to non numerical things.And then pretending that they havent just made the numbers up, which they have.Economics is like astrology in that sense, except that economics serves to justify the current power structure, and so it has a lot of fervent believers among the powerful.Better just to concentrate on what were doing here, Marina put in.The basic equation is simple, efficiency merely equals the calories you put out, divided by the calories you take in, times one hundred to put it in the form of a percentage.In the classic sense of passing along calories to ones predator, ten percent was average, and twenty percent doing really well.Most predators at the tops of food chains did more like five percent.This is why tigers have ranges of hundreds of square kilometers, Vlad said.Robber barons are not really very efficient.So tigers dont have predators not because theyre so tough, but because its not worth the effort, John said.Exactly!The problem is in calculating the values, Marina said.We have had to simply assign certain calorie equivalent numerical values to all kinds of activities, and then go on from there.But we were talking about economics?John said.But this is economics, dont you see, this is our eco economics!Everyone should make their living, so to speak, based on a calculation of their real contribution to the human ecology.Everyone can increase their ecological efficiency by efforts to reduce how many kilocalories they use this is the old Southern argument against the energy consumption of the Northern industrial nations.There was a real ecologic basis to that objection, because no matter how much the industrial nations produced, in the larger equation they could not be as efficient as the South.They were predators on the South, John said.Yes, and they will become predators on us too, if we let them.And like all predators their efficiency is low.But here, you see in this theoretical state of independence that you speak of she grinned at Johns look of consternationyou do, you have to admit that that is ultimately what you talk about all the time, John well, there it should be the law that people are rewarded in proportion to their contribution to the system.Dmitri, coming in the lab, said, From each according to his capacities, to each according to his needs!No, thats not the same, Vlad said.What it means is, You get what you pay for!But thats already true, John said.How is this different from the economics that already exists?They all scoffed at once, Marina most persistently: ...theres all kinds of phantom work!Unreal values assigned to most of the jobs on Earth!The entire transnational executive class does nothing a computer couldnt do, and there are whole categories of parasitical jobs that add nothing to the system by an ecologic accounting.Advertising, stock brokerage, the whole apparatus for making money only from the manipulation of money that is not only wasteful but corrupting, as all meaningful money values get distorted in such manipulation.She waved a hand in disgust.Well, Vlad said, we can say that their efficiency is very low, and that they predate on the system without having any predators, so that they are either the top of the chain or parasitical, depending on how you define it.Advertising, money brokering, some types of manipulation of the law, some politics....But all of these are subjective judgments!John exclaimed.How have you actually assigned caloric values to such a variety of activities?Well, we have done our best to calculate what they contribute back to the system in terms of well being measured as a physical thing.What does the activity equal in terms of food, or water, or shelter, or clothing, or medical aid, or education, or free time?Weve talked it over, and usually everyone at Acheron has offered a number, and we have taken the mean.Here, let me show you....And they would talk through the evening about it before the computer screen, and John would ask questions, and plug Pauline in to record the screens and tape the discussions, and they would go through the equations and jab their fingers at the flow charts, and then stop for coffee and perhaps take it up to the crest, to pace the length of the greenhouse arguing vehemently about the human value in kilocalories of plumbing, opera, simulation programming and the like.They were up on the crest, in fact, one afternoon near sunset, when John looked up from the equation on his wristpad, and stared up the long slope toward Olympus Mons.The sky had darkened.It occurred to him that it might be just another double eclipse: Phobos was so close overhead that it blocked a third of the sun when it crossed in front of it, and Deimos about a ninth, and a couple times a month they crossed at the same time, causing a shadow to be cast across the land, as if a film had got in your eye, or you had had a bad thought.But this wasnt an eclipse; Olympus Mons was hidden from view, and the high southern horizon was a fuzzy bronze bar.Look at that, he said to the others, and pointed.A dust storm.They hadnt had a global dust storm in over ten years.John called up the weather satellite photos on his wristpad.The origin of the storm had been near the Thaumasia mohole, Senzeni Na.He called up Sax and found him blinking philosophically, stating his surprise in mild tones.Winds at the edge of the storm were up to six hundred and sixty kilometers an hour, Sax said.A new planetary record.It looks like this is going to be a big one.I thought the cryptogamic soils in the storm start up zones would have dampened them, or even stopped them.Obviously that model had something wrong with it.Okay, Sax, too bad about that, but itll be okay, I gotta go now because its rolling right down on us now and I want to watch.Have fun, Sax said deadpan before John clicked him off.Vlad and Ursula were scoffing at Saxs model temperature gradients between biotically defrosted soil and the remaining frosted areas would be greater than ever, and the winds between the two regions correspondingly fiercer, so that when they finally hit loose fines, off they would go.Totally obvious.Now that its happened, John said.He laughed and moved down the greenhouse to watch the storms approach by himself.Scientists could be so catty.The wall of dust rolled down the long lava slopes of Olympus Monss northern aureole.It had already halved the land visible since John first saw it, and now it approached like a giant breaking wave, a billowy chocolate milk wave 10,000 meters high, with a bronze filigree foaming up and off it, leaving great curved streamers in the pink sky above.Wow!John cried.Here it comes!Here it comes!Suddenly the crest of the Acheron fin seemed located a great distance above the long narrow canyons of the fossae below them, and lower fin ridges reared like dragon backs out of the cracked lava: a wild place from which to face the onrush of such a storm, too high, too exposed.John laughed again, and pressed himself against the southern windows of the greenhouse, looking down, out, around, shouting, Wow!Wow!Look at it go!Wow!And then suddenly they were overwhelmed, dust flying over them, darkness, a high whooshing shriek.The first impact against Acheron ridge caused a wild flurry of turbulence, quick cyclonic twisters that appeared and disappeared, horizontal, vertical, at angles up the few steep gullies in the ridge.The general shriek was punctuated by booms as these disturbances hit the ridge and collapsed.Then with dreamlike rapidity the wind settled into a smooth standing wave, and the dust rushed up past Johns face; the pit of his stomach lifted, as if the greenhouse were suddenly dropping with violent speed.Certainly thats what it looked like, as the ridge had caused a ferocious updraft.Stepping back, however, he saw the dust streaming overhead and then off to the north.On that side of the greenhouse he could see for a few kilometers, before the wind smashed into the ground again and cut off the view in continual explosions of dust.Wow!His eyes were dry, and his mouth felt a bit caked.Lots of the fines were less than a micron across was that a faint sheen of them, there already across the bamboo leaves?No.Only the weird light of the storm.But there would be dust on everything, eventually.No seal system could keep it out.Vlad and Ursula were not completely confident of the greenhouses ability to withstand the wind, and they encouraged everyone up there to go downstairs.On the way down John reestablished contact with Sax.Saxs mouth was bunched into a tighter knot than usual.They would lose a lot of insolation with this storm, he said evenly.Equatorial surface temperatures had been averaging eighteen degrees higher than the baseline figures, but temperatures near Thaumasia were already down six degrees, and they would continue to plummet for the duration of the storm.And, he added with what seemed to John an almost masochistic completeness, the mohole thermals would loft the dust higher than ever before, so that it was all too possible that the storm might last for a long time.Buck up, Sax, John advised.I think itll be shorter than ever before.Dont be so pessimistic.Later on, when the storm was going into its second M year, Sax would remind John of this prediction with a little laugh.Traveling during the storm was officially restricted to the trains and to certain heavily used double transponder roads, but when it became obvious that it wasnt going to die back down that summer, John ignored the restrictions and resumed his wanderings.He made sure that his rover was well stocked, he had a backup rover follow him, and he had an extra powerful radio transmitter installed.That and Pauline in the drivers seat would be enough to get him around most of the northern hemisphere, he figured; rover breakdowns were rare, because of the really comprehensive internal monitoring systems hooked into their control computers.Two rover breakdowns at once was unheard of, there had been only a single recorded fatality as a result of that happening.So he said good bye to the Acheron group, and took off again.Driving in the storm was like driving at night, except more interesting.The dust rocketed by in gusts, leaving little pockets of visibility that gave him quick dim sepia snatches of a view, the landscape rolling, everything seeming to be moving south.Then blank rushing tempests of dust would return again, flush against the windows.The rover rocked hard on its shock absorbers during the worst gusts, and the dust did indeed get into everything.On the fourth day of his drive he turned straight south, and began to drive up the northwest slope of the Tharsis Bulge.This was the great escarpment again, but here it was not a cliff, only a slope imperceptible in the storms dark, lasting for more than a day, until he was high on the side of Tharsis, five vertical kilometers higher than he had been in Acheron.He stopped at another mine, located near crater Pt (called Pete), located in the upper end of the Tantalus Fossae.Apparently the Tharsis Bulge had initiated the great lava flood covering Alba Patera, and later bulging had then cracked the lava shield; these were the Tantalus canyons.Some of them had cracked over a platinoid rich mafic igneous intrusion that the miners had named the Merensky Reeflets.The miners were real Azanians this time, but Azanians who called themselves Afrikaaners, and spoke Afrikaaner among themselves; white men who welcomed John with heavy doses of God, volk, and trek.They had named the canyons they worked in Neuw Orange Free State and Neuw Pretoria.And they, like the miners at Bradbury Point, worked for Armscor.Yes, the operations head said happily, with an accent like a New Zealanders.He had a heavily jowled face, a ski jump nose and a big crooked smile, and a very intense manner.Weve found iron, copper, silver, manganese, aluminum, gold, platinum, titanium, chromium, you name it.Sulfides, oxides, silicates, native metals, you name it.The Great Escarpment has them all.The mine had been running for about an M year; it consisted of strip mines on the canyon floors, with a habitat half buried in the mesa between two of the largest canyons, looking like a clear eggshell, packed with a meat of green trees and orange tile roofs.John spent several days with them, being sociable and asking questions.More than once, thinking of the Acheron groups eco economics, he asked them how they were going to get their valuable but heavy product back to Earth.Would the energy cost of the transfer overwhelm the potential profit?Of course, they said, just like the men at Bradbury Point.It will take the space elevator to make it worthwhile.Their chief said, With the space elevator we are in the Terran market.Without it we will never get off Mars.Thats not necessarily a bad thing, John said.But they didnt understand him, and when he tried to explain it they only went blank and nodded politely, anxious to avoid thinking about politics.Which was something Afrikaaners were good at.When John realized what was going on, he found he could bring up the topic of politics to get some time to himself; it was, he said to Maya one night on the wrist, like tossing a tear gas canister in the room.It even enabled him to wander into the mining operations center alone for most of an afternoon, linking Pauline to the records and recording everything that she could lift.Pauline noticed no unusual patterns in the operation.But she did flag an exchange of communications with the Armscor home office; the local group wanted a security unit of a hundred persons, and Singapore had agreed to it.John whistled.What about UNOMA?Security was supposed to be entirely their purview, and they gave out approval for private security pretty routinely; but a hundred people?John instructed Pauline to look into the UNOMA dispatches on the subject, and left for dinner with the Afrikaaners.Again the space elevator was declared a necessity.Theyll just pass us by if we dont have it, go straight out to the asteroids and not have any gravity well to worry about, eh?Despite the five hundred micrograms of omegendorph in his system, John was not in a happy mood.Tell me, he said at one point, do any women work here?They stared at him like fish.They were even worse than Moslems, really.He left the next day and drove up to Pavonis, intent on looking into the space elevator notion.Up the long slope of Tharsis.He never saw the steep, blood colored cone of Ascraeus Mons; it was lost in the dust along with everything else.Travel now consisted of life in a set of small rooms that bumped around a lot.He worked his way around Ascraeus on its west flank, and then motored up onto the crest of Tharsis, between Ascraeus and Pavonis.Here the double transponder road became an actual concrete ribbon under the wheels concrete under a rush of dust, concrete that finally tilted up sharply, and led him straight up the northern slope of Pavonis Mons.It went on for so long that it began to feel like a slow blind takeoff into space.The crater of Pavonis, as the Afrikaaners had reminded him, was amazingly equatorial; the round O of its caldera sat like a ball placed right on the equator line.This apparently made the south rim of Pavonis the perfect tethering point for a space elevator, as it was both directly on the equator, and twenty seven kilometers above the datum.Phyllis had already arranged for the construction of a preliminary habitat on the south rim; she had thrown herself into work on the elevator, and was one of its chief organizers.Her habitat was dug into the rim wall of the caldera, in Echus Overlook style, so that windows in several stories of rooms looked out over the caldera, or would when the dust cleared.Photos blown up and stuck on the walls showed that the caldera itself would eventually be revealed as a simple circular depression, with walls 5,000 meters deep, slightly terraced near the bottom; the caldera had slumped often in earlier days, but always in nearly the same place.It was the only one of the great volcanoes to have been so regular; the other three had calderas that were like sets of overlapping circles, with each circle set at a different depth.The new habitat, nameless at this point, had been built by UNOMA, but the equipment and personnel had been provided by the transnational Praxis, one of the biggest of them all.Currently the rooms that were finished were crowded with Praxis executives, or executives of some of the other transnationals who had subcontracts on the elevator project, among them were representatives of Amex, Oroco, Subarashii, and Mitsubishi.And all their efforts were being coordinated by Phyllis, who was now apparently Helmut Bronskis assistant in charge of the operation.Helmut too was there, and after John had greeted him and Phyllis, and been introduced to some of the visiting consultants, John was led into a big high room with a window wall.Outside the window swirled clouds of dark orange dust dropping down into the caldera, so that it seemed that the room ascended, uncertainly, in a dim fluctuating light.The rooms only furnishing was a globe of Mars one meter in diameter, resting waist high on a blue plastic stand.Extending from the globe, specifically from the little bump that represented Pavonis Mons, was a silver wire about five meters long.At the end of the thread was a small black dot.The globe was rotating on the stand at about one rpm, and the silver wire and its terminating black dot rotated with it, always remaining above Pavonis.A group of about eight people ringed this display.Everything is to scale, Phyllis said.The areosynchronous satellite distance is 20,435 kilometers from the center of mass, and the equatorial radius is 3,386 kilometers, so the distance from the surface to the areosynchronous point is 17,049 kilometers; double that and add the radius, and you have 37,484 kilometers.Well have a ballast rock at the far end, so the actual cable wont have to be as long as it would be without it.The diameter of the cable will be about ten meters, and will weigh about six billion tons.The material for it will have been mined from its terminal ballast point, which will be an asteroid that starts at around thirteen and a half billion tons, and ends up when the cable is finished at the proper ballast weight of around seven and a half billion tons.Thats not a very big asteroid, about two kilometers in radius to begin with; there are six Amor asteroids crossing Marss orbit that have been identified as candidates for the job.The cable will be manufactured by robots mining and processing the carbon in the asteroids chondrites.Then, in the last stages of construction, the cable will be maneuvered to its tethering point, here.She pointed at the floor of the room in dramatic fashion.At that point, the cable will be in areosynchronous orbit itself, barely touching down here, its weight suspended between the pull of the planets gravity and the centrifugal force of the upper part of the cable, and the terminal ballast rock.What about Phobos?John asked.Phobos is way down there, of course.The cable will be vibrating to avoid it, in what the designers call a Clarke oscillation.It wont be a problem.Deimos will also have to be avoided by oscillation, but because its orbit is more inclined this wont be such a frequent problem.And when its in position?Helmut asked, his face bright with pleasure.A few hundred elevators at least will be attached to the cable, and loads will be lifted into orbit using a counterweight system.There will be lots of material to load down from Earth as usual, so energy requirements for lifts will be minimized.It will also be possible to use the cables rotation as a slingshot; objects released from the ballast asteroid toward Earth will be using the power of Marss rotation as their push, and will have an energy free high speed takeoff.Its a clean, efficient, extraordinarily cheap method, both for lifting bulk into space and for accelerating it toward Earth.And given the recent discoveries of strategic metals, which are becoming ever more scarce on Earth, a cheap lift and push like this is literally invaluable.It creates the possibility of an exchange that wasnt economically viable before; it will be a critical component of the Martian economy, the keystone of its industry.And it wont be that expensive to build.Once a carbonaceous asteroid is pushed into the proper orbit, and a nuclear powered robotic cable plant put to work on it, the plant will extrude cable like a spider spinning its thread.There will be very little to do but wait.The cable plant as designed will be able to produce over three thousand kilometers of cable a year this means we need to start as soon as possible, but after production begins, it will only take ten or eleven years.And the wait will be well worth it.Shikata ga nai, John thought sardonically.Phyllis glanced very briefly at John, as if he had spoken aloud.We wont let that happen, she said.And best of all, our elevator will serve as an experimental prototype for a Terran one.The transnationals who gain expertise in building this elevator will be in a commanding position when it comes to bidding the contracts for the much larger Terran project that is sure to follow.John stared at Phyllis, impressed as always by her fervor.She was like a convert giving witness, a preacher in a pulpit, quietly and confidently triumphant.The miracle of the skyhook.Jack and the Beanstalk, the Ascension to Heaven; it definitely had an air of the miraculous to it.Really, we dont have much choice, Phyllis was saying.This gets us out of our gravity well, eliminating it as a physical and economic problem.Thats crucial; without that well be bypassed, well be like Australia in the nineteenth century, too far away to be a significant part of the world economy.People will pass us by and mine the asteroids directly, because the asteroids have mineral wealth without gravitational constraints.Without the elevator we could become a backwater.On and on she went, outlining every aspect of the plan, and then answering questions from the executives with her usual polished brilliance.She got a lot of laughs she was flushed, bright eyed.John could almost see the tongues of fire flickering from her mass of auburn hair, which in the storm light looked like a cap of jewels.The executives and project scientists glowed under her look; they were onto something big, and they knew it.Earth was seriously depleted in many of the metals they were finding on Mars.There were fortunes to be made, enormous fortunes.And someone who owned a piece of the bridge over which every ounce of metal had to pass would make an enormous fortune as well, probably the greatest fortune of all.No wonder Phyllis and the rest of them looked like they were in church.Before dinner that evening John stood in his bathroom, and without looking at himself in the mirror took out two tabs of omegendorph and swallowed them.He was sick of Phyllis.But the drug made him feel better.Phyllis was just another part of the game, after all; and when he sat down to dinner he was in an expansive mood.Okay, he thought, they have their gold mine of a beanstalk.But it wasnt clear that they would be able to keep it to themselves highly unlikely in fact.So that their fat cat complacency was a bit silly, as well as grating, and he laughed in the middle of one of their enthusiastic exchanges and said, Dont you think it unlikely that an elevator like this will stay private property?We dont intend for it to be private property, Phyllis said with her brilliant smile.But you expect to be paid for its construction.And then you expect concessions to be granted.You expect to make a profit from the venture, isnt that what venture capitalism is all about?Well, of course, Phyllis said, looking offended that he had spoken of such things so explicitly.Everyone on Mars will profit from it, thats its nature.And youll skim a percentage of every percentage.Predators at the top of the chain.Or else parasites, up and down the length of it....How rich did the builders of the Golden Gate Bridge get, do you think?Were there great transnational dynasties formed from the profits of the Golden Gate Bridge?No.It was a public project, wasnt it.The builders were public employees, making a standard wage for their work.What do you want to bet that the Mars treaty doesnt stipulate a similar arrangement for infrastructural construction here?Im pretty sure it does.But the treaty is up for revision in nine years, Phyllis pointed out, her eyes glittering.John laughed.So it is!But you wouldnt believe the support I see around this planet for a revised treaty that sets even tighter limits on Terran investment and profit.You just havent been paying attention.The thing you have to remember is that this is an economic system being built from scratch, on principles that make sense in scientific terms.Theres only a limited carrying capacity here, and to create a sustainable society weve got to pay attention to that.You cant just lift raw materials from here to Earth the colonial era is over, you have to remember that.He laughed again at the glinty stares being leveled on him; it was like gun sights had been implanted in their corneas.And it only occurred to him later, back in his room and remembering those looks, that it probably had not been a very good idea to stick their noses in the situation so hard.The Amex man had even lifted his wrist to his mouth to take down a note, in a gesture obviously meant to be seen: This John Boone was bad news!he had whispered, eyes on John all the while; he had wanted John to see him.Well, another suspect then.But it took John a while to get to sleep that night.He left Pavonis the next day, and headed east down Tharsis, intending to drive a full 7,000 kilometers to Hellas, to visit Maya.The journey was made strangely solitary by the great storm.He glimpsed the southern highlands in murky snatches only, through billowing sheets of sand, with the ever shifting whistle of the wind as accompaniment.Maya was pleased he was coming to visit; he had never been to Hellas before, and a lot of people there were looking forward to meeting him.They had discovered a sizable aquifer to the north of Low Point, so their plan was to pump water from that aquifer to the surface, and create a lake in the low point, a lake with a frozen surface which would be continuously subliming into the atmosphere, but which they would keep supplied from below.Sustained in that way it would both enrich the atmosphere, and serve as a reservoir and heat sink for cultivation, in a ring of domed farms built around the lake shore.Maya was very excited at the plans.Johns long journey toward her passed in a mesmerized state, as he watched crater after crater loom out of the clouds of dust.One evening he stopped at a Chinese settlement where they knew hardly a word of English, and lived in boxes like the trailer park; he and the settlers had to make use of an AI translation program which kept them both laughing for most of the evening.Two days later, he stopped for a day at a huge Japanese air mining facility in a high pass between craters.Here everyone spoke excellent English, but they were frustrated because the air miners had been brought to a standstill by the storm.The technicians smiled painfully, and escorted him through a nightmare complex of filtering systems that they had set up to try to keep the pumps working and all for naught.East three days from the Japanese, he ran across a Sufi caravanserai, located on top of a circular steep walled mesa.This particular mesa had once been a crater floor, but it had been so hardened by impact metamorphosis that it had resisted the erosion that had cut away the surrounding soft land in the eons that followed, and now it stood above the plain like a thick round pedestal, its furrowed sides a kilometer high.John drove up a switchbacking ramp road to the caravanserai on top.Up there he found that the mesa was situated in a permanent standing wave in the dust storm, so that there was more sunlight leaking through the dark clouds here than anywhere else he had been, even on the rim of Pavonis.Visibility was almost as truncated as everywhere else, but everything was more brightly colored, the dawns purple and chocolate, the days a vivid cloudy rush of umbers and yellow, orange and rust, pierced by the occasional bronzed sunbeam.Talib?John said.Tariqat?It was a great spot, and the Sufis proved to be more hospitable than any of the Arab groups he had met so far.They had come up in one of the latest Arab groups, they told him, as a concession to religious factions in the Arab world back home; and as Sufis were numerous among Islamic scientists, there had been very few objections to sending them as a coherent group of their own.One of them, a small black man named Dhu el Nun, said to him, Its wonderful in this time of the seventy thousand veils that you, the great talib, have followed his tariqat here to visit us.A talib is a seeker.And the seekers tariqat is his path, his special path you know, on the road to reality.I see!John said, still surprised at the friendliness of their greeting.Dhu led him from the garage to a low black building which stood in the center of a ring of rovers, looking dense with concentrated energy; a squat round thing like a model of the mesa itself, its windows rough clear crystals.Dhu identified the black rock of the building as stishovite, a high density silicate created by the meteors impact, when pressures of over a million kilograms per square centimeter had momentarily existed.The windows were made of lechatelierite, a kind of compressed glass also created by the impact.Inside the building, a party of about twenty people greeted him, both men and women alike.The women were bare headed and behaved just like the men, which again surprised John, and alerted him to the fact that things among the Sufis were different than they were among Arabs generally.He sat down and drank coffee with them, and started asking questions again.They were Qadarite Sufis, they told him, pantheists influenced by early Greek philosophy and modern existentialism, trying by modern science and the ru yat al qalb, the vision of the heart, to become one with that ultimate reality which was God.There are four mystical journeys, Dhu said to him.The first begins with gnosis and ends with fana, or passing away from all phenomenal things.The second begins when fana is succeeded by baqa, or abiding.At this point you journey in the real, by the real, to the real, and you yourself are a reality, a haqq.And after that you move on to the center of the spirit universe, and become one with all others who have done likewise.I guess I havent begun the first journey yet, John said.I dont know anything.They were pleased by this response, he could see.You can start, they told him, and poured him more coffee.You can always start.They were so encouraging and friendly compared to any of the Arabs John had met before that he opened up to them, and told them about his trip to Pavonis, and the plans for the great elevator cable.No fancy in the world is all untrue, Dhu said.And when John mentioned his last meeting with Arabs, on Vastitas Borealis, and how Frank had been accompanying them, Dhu said cryptically, Its the love of right lures men to wrong.One of the women laughed and said, Chalmers is your nafs.Whats that?John asked.They were all laughing.Dhu, shaking his head, said He is not your nafs.Ones nafs is ones evil self, which some used to believe lived in ones chest.Like an organ or something?Like an actual creature.Mohammed ibn Ulyan for instance reported that something like a young fox leaped out of his throat, and when he kicked it it only got bigger.That was his nafs.It is another name for your Shadow, the woman who had brought it up explained.Well, John said.Maybe he is, then.Or maybe its just that Franks nafs gets kicked a lot.And they laughed with him at the thought.Later that afternoon sunlight pierced the dust more strongly than usual, lighting the streaming clouds so that the caravanserai seemed to rest in the ventricle of a giant heart, with the gusts of the wind saying beat, beat, beat, beat.The Sufis called out to each other when they looked through the lechatelierite windows, and quickly they suited up to go out into this crimson world, into the wind, calling to Boone to accompany them.He grinned and suited up, surreptitiously swallowing a tab of omeg as he did so.Once outside they walked the circumference of the ragged edge of the mesa, looking out into the clouds and down onto the shadowed plain below, pointing out to John whatever features happened to be visible.After that they gathered near the caravanserai, and John listened to their voices as they chanted, various voices providing English translations for the Arabic and Farsi.Possess nothing and be possessed by nothing.Put away what you have in your head, give what you have in your heart.Here a world and there a world, we are seated on the threshold.Another voice: Love thrilled the chord in my souls lute, and changed me to love from head to foot.And they began to dance.Watching John suddenly got it, that they were whirling dervishes: they leaped into the air to the beat of drums pattering lightly over the common band, they leaped and whirled in slow unearthly spins, arms outstretched, and when they touched down they pushed off and did it again, for turn after turn after turn.Whirling dervishes in the great storm, on a high round mesa that had been a crater floor in the Noachian.It looked so marvelous in the bloody pulsing glow of light that John stood up and started to spin with them.He wrecked their symmetries, he sometimes actually collided with other dancers; but no one seemed to mind.He found that it helped to jump slightly into the wind, to keep from being blown off balance.A hard gust would knock you flat.He laughed.Some of the dancers were chanting over the common band, the usual quarter tone ululations, punctuated by shouts and harsh rhythmic breathing, and the phrase Ana el Haqq, ana el Haqq I am God, one translated, I am God.A Sufi heresy.The dancing was meant to hypnotize you there were other Moslem cults that did it with self flagellation, John knew.Spinning was better; he danced, he joined the chant on the common band by punctuating it with his own rapid breath, and with grunts and babble.Then without thinking about it he began to add to the flow of sound the names for Mars, muttering them in the rhythm of the chant as he understood it.Al Qahira, Ares, Auqakuh, Bahram.Harmakhis, Hrad, Huo Hsing, Kasei.Maadim, Maja, Mamers, Mangala.Nirgal, Shalbatanu, Simud and Tiu.He had memorized the list years before as a kind of party trick; now he was quite surprised to find what an excellent chant it made, how it spilled out of his mouth and helped stabilize his spinning.The other dancers were laughing at him, but in a good way, they sounded pleased.He felt drunk, his whole body was humming.He repeated the litany many times, then shifted to repeating the Arabic name, over and over: Al Qahira, Al Qahira, Al Qahira.And then, remembering what one of the translating voices had told him, Ana el Haqq, ana Al Qahira.Ana el Haqq, ana Al Qahira.I am God, I am Mars, I am God.The others quickly joined him in this chant, lifted it into a wild song, and in the flash of rotating faceplates he caught sight of their grinning faces.They were really good spinners;as they whirled their outstretched fingers cut the rush of red dust into arabesques, and now as they spun they tapped him with their fingertips, guiding him or even actively pushing his clumsy turns into the weave of their pattern.He shouted the planets names and they repeated them after him, in call and response style.They chanted the names, Arabic, Sanskrit, Inca, all the names for Mars, mixed together in a soup of syllables, creating a polyphonic music that was beautiful and shivery strange, for the names for Mars came from times when words sounded odd, and names had power: he could hear that when he sang them.Im going to live for a thousand years, he thought.When he finally stopped dancing and sat to watch, he began to feel sick.The world swam, his middle ear thingie was no doubt still spinning like a roulette ball.The scene pulsed before him, it was impossible to say whether this was the swirling dust or something internal, but either way he goggled at what he saw: whirling dervishes, on Mars?Well, in the Moslem world they were deviants of a kind, and with an ecumenical bent rare in Islam.And scientists too.So they were his way into Islam, perhaps, his tariqat; and their dervish ceremonies could perhaps be shifted into the areophany, as during his chant.He stood, reeling; all of a sudden he understood that one didnt have to invent it all from scratch, that it was a matter of making something new by synthesis of all that was good in what came before.Love thrilled the chord of love in my lute He was too dizzy.The others were laughing at him, supporting him.He talked to them in his usual way, hoping they would understand.I feel sick.I think Im going to throw up.But you must tell me why we cant leave all the sad Terran baggage behind.Why we cant invent together a new religion.The worship of Al Qahira, Mangala, Kasei!They laughed, and carried him on their shoulders back toward the shelter.Im serious, he said as the world spun.I want you people to do it, I want your dancing to be in it, its obvious you should be the ones to design this religion, youre doing it already.But vomiting in a helmet was dangerous, and they only laughed at him and hustled him into the crushed stone habitat as quickly as they could.There as he threw up a woman held his head, saying in musical subcontinental English, The King asked his wise men for some single thing that would make him happy when he was sad, but sad when he was happy.They consulted and came back with a ring engraved with the message This Too Will Pass.Straight into the recyclers, Boone said.He lay back spinning.It was kind of an awful feeling, when you were trying to lie still.But what do you want here?Why are you on Mars?You have to tell me what you want here.They took him to the common room and set out cups, and a pot of aromatic tea.He still felt like he was spinning, and the dust rushing by the crystalline windows didnt help.One of the old women around him picked up the pot and poured Johns cup full.She put down the pot, gestured: Now you fill mine.John did so, unsteadily, and then the pot went around the room.Each pourer filled someone elses cup.We start every meal this way, the old woman said.It is a little sign of how we are together.We have studied the old cultures, before your global market netted everything, and in those ages there existed many different forms of exchange.Some of them were based on the giving of gifts.Each of us has a gift, you see, given us freely by the universe.And each of us with every breath gives something back.Like the equation for ecologic efficiency, John said.Maybe so.In any case, whole cultures were built around the idea of the gift, in Malaysia, in the American northwest, in many primitive cultures.In Arabia we gave water, or coffee.Food and shelter.And whatever you were given, you did not expect to keep, but gave it back again in your turn, hopefully with interest.You worked to be able to give more than you received.Now we think that this can be the basis for a reverent economics.Its just what Vlad and Ursula said!Maybe so.The tea helped.After a while his equilibrium returned.They talked about other things, the great storm, the great hard plinth they lived on.Late that night he asked if they had heard of the coyote, but they hadnt.They did know stories about a creature they called the hidden one, the last survivor of an ancient race of Martians, a wizened thing who wandered the planet helping endangered wanderers, rovers, settlements.It had been spotted at the water station in Chasma Borealis last year, during an ice fall and subsequent power outage.Its not Big Man?John asked.No, no.Big Man is big.The hidden one is like us.Its people were Big Mans subjects.I see.But he didnt, not really.If Big Man stood for Mars itself, then maybe the story of the hidden one had been inspired by Hiroko.Impossible to say.He needed a folklorist, or a scholar of myths, someone who could tell him how stories were born; but he had only these Sufis, grinning and weird, story creatures themselves.His fellow citizens in this new land.He had to laugh.They laughed with him and took him off to bed.We say a bedtime prayer from the Persian poet Rumi Jalaluddin, the old woman told him, and recited it:  I died as mineral and became a plant,    I died as plant and rose to animal.I died as animal and I was human.Why should I fear?When was I less by dying?Yet once more I shall die human,    To soar with angels blessed above.And when I sacrifice my angel soul    I shall become what no mind ever conceived.Sleep well, she said into his drowsing mind.This is all our path.The next morning he climbed stiffly in his rover, wincing with soreness and determined to eat some omeg as soon as he got on his way.The same woman was there to see him off, and he bumped his faceplate against hers affectionately.Whether it be of this world or of that, she said, your love will lead us yonder in the end.The transponder road led him through the brown wind torn days, crossing the broken land south of Margaritifer Sinus.John would have to drive it again some other time to see any of it, for in the storm it was nothing but flying chocolate, pierced by momentary golden shafts of light.Near Bakhuysen Crater he stopped at a new settlement called Turner Wells; here they had tapped into an aquifer that was under such hydrostatic pressure at its lower end that they were going to generate power by running the artesian flow through a series of turbines.The water released would be poured into molds, frozen, and then hauled by robot to dry settlements all over the southern hemisphere.Mary Dunkel was working there, and she showed John around the wells, the power plant, and the ice reservoirs.The exploratory drilling was actually scary as hell.When the drill hit the liquid part of the aquifer it was blasted back out of the well, and it was touch and go whether we were going to be able to control the gusher or not.What would have happened if you hadnt?Well, I dont know.Theres a lot of water down there.If it broke the rock around the well, it might have gone like the big outflow channels in Chryse.That big?Who knows?Its possible.Wow.Thats what I said!Now Ann has started an investigation into methods for determining aquifer pressures by the echoes they give back in the seismic tests.But there are people who would like to release an aquifer or two, see?They leave messages on the bulletin boards in the net.I wouldnt be surprised if Sax is among them.Big floods of water and ice, lots of sublimation into the air, why shouldnt he cheer?But floods like those old ones would be as destructive to the landscape as dropping asteroids on it.Oh, more destructive!Those channels downslope from the chaoses were incredible outbreaks.The best Terran analogy is the scab lands in eastern Washington, have you heard of them?About eighteen thousand years ago there was a lake covering most of Montana, Lake Missoula they call it, composed of Ice Age meltwater and held in place by an ice dam.At some point this ice dam broke and the lake emptied catastrophically, about two trillion cubic meters of water, draining down the Columbia plateau and out to the Pacific in a matter of days.Wow.While it lasted it ran about a hundred times the discharge of the Amazon, and carved channels in the basalt bedrock that are as much as two hundred meters deep.Two hundred meters!Right.And this was nothing compared to the ones that cut the Chryse channels!The anastomosing up there covers areas  Two hundred meters of bedrock?Yeah, well, it isnt just normal erosion.In floods that big the pressures fluctuate so much that you get exsolution of dissolved gases, you know, and when those bubbles collapse they produce incredible pressures.Hammering like that can break anything.So it would be worse than an asteroid strike.Sure.Unless you dropped a really big asteroid.But there are people who think we should be doing that too, right?Are there?You know there are.But the floods are better yet, if you want to do that kind of thing.If you could direct one of them into Hellas, for instance, youd have a sea.And you might be able to refill it faster than the surface ice sublimed.Direct a flood like that?John exclaimed.Well, yeah, that would be impossible.But if you found one in the right spot, you wouldnt have to direct it.You should check where Sax has sent the dowsing team lately, see what it looks like to you.But it would be forbidden by UNOMA for sure.Since when has that mattered to Sax?John laughed.Oh, it matters now.Theyve given him too much for him to ignore them.Theyve tied him down with money and power.Maybe.That night at 3:30 A. M.  there was a small explosion in one of the well heads, and alarm bells ripped them from sleep and sent them stumbling through the tunnels half naked, to be faced with a gusher that was shooting up into the nights flying dust, in a column of white water torn to shreds in the unsteady glare of hastily directed spotlights.The water was falling out of the dust clouds as chunks of ice, hail the size of bowling balls.Wells downwind were being pummeled by these missiles, and the ice balls were already knee deep.Given the discussion of the previous evening John found himself quite alarmed by the sight, and he ran around until he found Mary.Through the noise of the eruption and the ever present storm, Mary shouted in Johns ear: Clear the area, Im going to set off a charge beside the well and try to snuff it!She ran off in her white nightshirt, and John rounded up the spectators and got them back down the tunnels to the station habitat.Mary joined them in the lock, huffing and puffing, and fiddled with her wristpad, and there was a low boom in the direction of the well.Come on lets go see, she said, and they got through the lock and ran back down the tunnels toward the window overlooking the well.There in a tumble of white ice balls lay the wreckage of the drill, on its side, and still.Yeah!Capped!Mary cried.They cheered weakly.Some of them went down to the well area, to see if there was anything they could do to secure the situation.Good work!John said to Mary.Ive read a lot about well capping since that first incident, Mary said, still short of breath.And we had it all set up to go.But we never actually had the chance.To try it.Of course.So you never know.John said, Do your locks have recorders?They do.Great.John went to check them.He plugged Pauline into the station system, and asked questions, and scanned the answers as they appeared on his pad.No one had used the locks after the timeslip that night.He called the weather satellite overhead, and clicked into the radar and IR systems that Sax had given him the codes for, and scanned the area around Bakhuysen.No sign of any machines nearby, except some of the old windmill heaters.And the transponders showed that no one had been on the roads in the area since his arrival the previous day.John sat heavily before Pauline, feeling sluggish and slow witted.He couldnt think of any other checks to make, and it seemed from those he had, that no one had been out that night to do the damage.The explosion could have been arranged days before, perhaps, although it would be hard to hide the device, the wells being worked on daily.He got up slowly and went to find Mary, and with her help talked to the people who had last worked on that well, the day before.No sign of tampering then, all the way until eight p. m.  And after that everyone in the station had been at the John Boone party, the locks unused.So there really had been no chance.He went back to his bed and thought about it.Oh, by the way, Pauline please check Saxs records, and give me a list of all the dowsing expeditions in the last year.Continuing on his blind road to Hellas he ran into Nadia, who was overseeing the construction of a new kind of dome over Rabe Crater.It was the largest dome yet built, taking advantage of the thickening of the atmosphere and the lightening of construction materials, which created a situation where gravity could be balanced with pressure, making the pressurized dome effectively weightless.The frame was to be made of reinforced areogel beams, the latest from the alchemists; areogel was so light and strong that Nadia went into little raptures as she described the potential uses for it.Crater domes themselves were a thing of the past, in her opinion; it would be just as easy to erect areogel pillars around the circumference of a town, bypassing the rock enclosures and putting the whole population inside what would be in effect a big clear tent, with aerogel pillars.She told John all about it as they walked around Rabes interior, now nothing but a big construction site.The whole crater rim was going to be honeycombed with sky lighted rooms, and the domed interior would hold a farm that would feed 30,000.Earthmoving robots the size of buildings hummed out of the murk of the dust, invisible even fifty meters away.These behemoths were working on their own, or by teleoperation, and the teloperators probably had too little view of their surroundings to make nearby foot traffic entirely safe.John followed Nadia nervously as she strolled about, remembering how skittish the miners at Bradbury Point had been and there they had been able to see what was happening!He had to laugh at Nadias obliviousness.When the ground trembled underfoot, they just stopped and looked around, ready to leap away from any oncoming building sized vehicles.It was quite a tour.Nadia railed against the dust, which was wrecking a lot of machinery.The great storm was now four months old, the longest in years and it still showed no sign of ending.Temperatures had plummeted, people were eating canned and dried food, and an occasional salad or vegetable grown under artificial light.And dust was in everything.Even as they discussed it John could feel it caking his mouth, and his eyes were dry in their sockets.Headaches had become extremely common, as well as sinus trouble, sore throats, bronchitis, asthma, lung distress generally.Plus frequent cases of frostnip.And computers were becoming dangerously unreliable, a lot of hardware breakdown, a lot of AI neurosis or retardation.Middays inside Rabe were like living inside a brick, Nadia said, and sunsets looked like coal mine fires.She hated it.John changed the subject.What do you think of this space elevator?Big.But the effect, Nadia.The effect.Who knows?You can never tell with a thing like that, can you.Itll make a strategic bottleneck, like the one Phyllis used to talk about when we were discussing who would build Phobos station.Shell have made her own bottleneck.Thats a lot of power.Thats what Arkady says, but I dont see why it cant be treated as a common resource, like a natural feature.Youre an optimist.Thats what Arkady says.She shrugged.Im just trying to be sensible.Me too.I know.Sometimes I think were the only two.And Arkady?She laughed.But you two are a couple!Yes, yes.Like you and Maya.Touch.Nadia smiled briefly.I try to make Arkady think about things.Thats the best I can do.Were meeting at Acheron in a month, to take the treatment.Maya tells me its a good thing to do together.I recommend it, John said with a grin.And the treatment?Beats the alternative, right?She chuckled.Then the ground growled through their boots, and they stiffened and jerked their heads around, looking for shadows in the murk.A black bulk like a moving hill appeared to their right.They ran to the side, stumbling and hopping over cobbles and debris, John wondering if this were another attack, Nadia rapping out commands over the common band, cursing the teleoperators for not keeping track of them on the IR.Watch your screens, you lazy bastards!The ground stopped trembling.The black leviathan no longer moved.They approached it warily.A Brobdingnagian dump truck, on tracks.Built locally, by Utopia Planitia Machines; a robot built by robots, and big as an office block.John stared up at it, feeling the sweat drip down his forehead.They were safe.His pulse slowed.Monsters like this are all over the planet, he said to Nadia wonderingly.Cutting, scraping, digging, filling, building.Pretty soon some of them will attach themselves to one of those two kilometer asteroids, and build a power plant that will use the asteroid itself as fuel to drive it into Martian orbit, at which point other machines will land on it, and begin to transform the rock into a cable about thirty seven thousand kilometers long!The size of it, Nadia!The size!Its big all right.Its unimaginable, really.Something completely beyond human abilities as we were brought up to understand them.Teleoperation on a massive scale.A kind of spiritual waldo.Anything that can be imagined can be executed!Slowly they walked around the giant black object before them: no more than a kind of dump truck, nothing compared to what the space elevator would be; and yet even this truck, he thought, was an amazing thing.Muscle and brain have extended out through an armature of robotics that is so large and powerful that its difficult to conceptualize it.Maybe impossible.Thats probably part of your talent, and Saxs too to flex the muscles that no one else realizes we have yet.I mean holes drilled right through the lithosphere, the terminator lit with mirrored sunlight, all these cities filling mesas and stuck in the sides of cliffs and now a cable strung out way past Phobos and Deimos, so long that its both in orbit and touching down at the same time!Its impossible to imagine it!Not impossible, Nadia noted.No.And now of course we see the evidence of our power all around us, we almost get run down by it as it goes about its work!And seeing is believing.Even without an imagination you can see what kind of power we have.Maybe thats why things are getting so strange these days, everyone talking about ownership or sovereignty, fighting, making claims.People squabbling like those old gods on Olympus, because nowadays were just as powerful as they were.Or more, Nadia said.He drove on into the Hellespontus Montes, the curved mountain range surrounding Hellas Basin.Somehow, one night when he was sleeping, his rover got off the transponder road.He woke up, and in breaks in the dust saw that he was in a narrow valley, walled with small cliffs that were cut by the typical fluting of ravines.It seemed likely that by staying on the valley floor he would cross the road again, so he headed on cross country.Then the valley floor was disrupted by shallow transverse grabens like empty canals, and Pauline kept having to stop and turn and try another branch in her route finding algorithm, defeated by one gulch after another as they appeared out of the murk.When John got impatient and tried to take over, it only got worse.In the land of the blind, the autopilot is king.But slowly he closed on the valley mouth, where the map showed the transponder road descending to a wider valley below.So that night he stopped, unworried, and sat in front of the TV and ate a meal.Mangalavid was showing the premiere performance of an aeolia built by a group in Noctis Labyrinthus.The aeolia turned out to be a small building, cut with apertures which whistled or hooted or squeaked, depending on the angle and strength of the wind hitting them.For the premiere the daily downslope wind in Noctis was augmented by some fierce katabatic gusts from the storm, and the music fluctuated like a composition, mournful, angry, dissonant or in sudden snatches harmonic: it seemed the work of a mind, an alien mind perhaps, but certainly something more than random chance.The almost aleatory aeolia, as a commentator said.After that came news from Earth.The existence of the gerontological treatments had been leaked by an official in Geneva, and had flashed around the world in a day; now there was a violent debate going on in the General Assembly concerning the matter.Many delegates were demanding that the treatments be made a basic human right, guaranteed by the U. N.  for all, with funding from the developed nations placed immediately in a pool to make sure that financing for the treatments would be equally available to all.Meanwhile other reports were coming in: some religious leaders were coming out against the treatments, including the Pope; there were widespread riots, and some damage at certain medical centers.Governments were in a turmoil.All the faces on the TV were tense or angry, demanding change; and all the inequality, hatred and misery that the faces revealed made John flinch, he couldnt watch.He fell asleep, and then slept poorly.He was dreaming of Frank when a sound woke him.A knock on his windshield.It was the middle of the night.Groggily he locked the lock; sitting up he wondered that he had such a reflex action in him.When had he learned that one?He rubbed his jaw, turned on the common band.Hello?Anyone out there?The Martians.It was a mans voice.His English was accented, but John couldnt identify how.We want to talk, the voice said.John stood and looked out the windshield.At night, in the storm, there was precious little to see.But he thought he could pick out shapes in the blackness, there below him.We just want to talk, the voice said.If they had wanted to kill him they could have blown open the rover while he slept.Besides, he still couldnt quite believe that anyone wished him harm.There was no reason for it!So he let them in.There were five of them, all men.Their walkers were frayed, dirty, patched with material that had not been made for walkers.Their helmets were without identification, stripped of all paint.As they took off the helmets he saw that one of the men was Asian, and young; he looked about eighteen.The youth went forward and sat in the drivers seat, leaned over the steering wheel to look closer at the instrument array.Another got off his helmet; a short brown skinned man, with a thin face and long dreadlocks.He sat on the padded bench across from Johns bed, and waited for the other three men to get their helmets off too.When they did they crouched on their haunches, watching John attentively.He had never seen any of them before.The thin faced man said, We want you to slow the rate of immigration.He was the one who had spoken outside; now his accent sounded Caribbean.He spoke in a low voice, almost in a whisper, and John found it very difficult not to emulate him.Or stop it, the young man in the drivers seat said.Shut up, Kasei.The thin faced man never took his gaze from Johns face.There are too many people coming up.You know that.Theyre not Martian, and they dont care what happens here.Theyre going to overwhelm us, theyre going to overwhelm you.You know that.Youre trying to turn them into Martians, we know, but theyre coming in a lot faster than you can work.The only thing that will work is slowing down the influx.Or stopping it.The man rolled his eyes, appealed with a grimace for Johns understanding.The youth was young, his look said.I dont have any say John began, but the man cut him off:  You can advocate it.Youre a power, and youre on our side.Are you from Hiroko?The youth snicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth.The thin faced man said nothing.Four faces stared at John; the other looked resolutely out the window.John said, Have you been sabotaging the moholes?We want you to stop the immigration.I want you to stop the sabotage.Its just bringing more people here.Police.The man eyed him.What makes you think we can contact the saboteurs?Find them.Break in on them at night.The man smiled.Out of sight, out of mind.Not necessarily.They had to be with Hiroko.Occams razor.There couldnt be more than one hidden group.Or maybe there could.John felt light headed, and wondered if they were doctoring the air.Releasing aerosol drugs.He definitely felt strange, it was all surreal, dreamy; the wind buffeted the rover, sent a sudden burst of aeolian music coursing by, a weird drawn out hoot.His thoughts were slow and ponderous, and he felt the edge of a yawn.Thats it, he thought.Im still trying to wake from a dream.Why do you hide?he heard himself say.Were building Mars.Just like you.Were on your side.You ought to help, then.He tried to think.What about the space elevator?We dont care about it.The kid snicked.That isnt what matters.Its people that matter.The elevator will bring a lot more people.The man considered that.Slow the immigration, and it cant even be built.Another long silence, punctuated by the winds eerie commentary.Cant even be built?Did they think people would build it?Or maybe they meant the money.Ill look into it, John said.The kid turned and stared at him, and John raised a hand to forestall him.Ill do what I can.His hand stood before him, a huge pink thing.Thats all I can say.If I promised results, it would be lying.I know what you mean.Ill do what I can.He thought about it more, with difficulty.You ought to be out in the open, helping us.We need more help.Each in his way, the man said quietly.Well be going now.Well keep track to see what you do.Tell Hiroko I want to talk to her.The five men looked at him, the young one intense and angry.The thin faced man smiled briefly.If I see her I will.One of the crouching men held out a diaphanous blue mass an aerogel sponge, barely visible under the night running lights.The hand holding it made a fist.Yes, a drug.He lunged out and caught the young one unawares, clawed the youths bare neck and then fell, paralyzed.When he came to they were gone.He had a headache.He fell back onto the bed, into an uneasy sleep.The dream about Frank made an improbable return, and John told him about the visitation.Youre a fool, Frank said.You dont understand.When he woke again it was morning, swirling a dim burnt umber outside the windshield.The winds had appeared to be lessening in the last month, but it was hard to be sure.Shapes in the dust clouds appeared briefly and then fell back into chaos, in little sensory deprivation hallucinations.It really was sensory deprivation, this storm, and getting very claustrophobic indeed.He ate some omeg, suited up and went outside and walked around, breathing talcum and bending over to follow the tracks of his visitors.They crossed bedrock and disappeared.A difficult rendezvous, he would have thought; a lost rover at night, how had they found it?But if they had been tracking him ...Back inside he called up the satellites.Radar and IR got nothing but his rover.Even walkers would have shown on the IR, so presumably they had a refuge nearby.Easy to hide in mountains like these.He called up his Hiroko map and drew a rough circle around his location, bulging it north and south in the mountains.He had several circles on the Hiroko map by now, but none of them had been searched by ground crews with any thoroughness, and probably they never would be, as most of them were in chaotic terrain, ravaged land the size of Wyoming or Texas.Its a big world, he muttered.He wandered around the inside of the car, looking at the floor.Then he remembered the last thing he had done.He looked under his fingernails;a little skin matter was stuck there, yes.He got a sample dish from the little auto clave, and carefully scraped what was there onto the dish.Genome identification was far beyond the rovers capabilities, but any big lab ought to be able to identify the youth, if his genome was on record.If not, that too would be useful information.And maybe Ursula and Vlad could identify him by parentage.He relocated the transponder trail that afternoon, and came down into Hellas Basin late the next day.He found Sax there, attending a conference on the new lake, although it appeared that it was turning into a conference on agriculture under artificial lighting.The next morning John took him out in the clear tunnels between buildings, and they walked in a shifting yellow murk, the sun a saffron glow in the clouds to the east.I think I met the coyote, John said.Did you!Did he tell you where Hiroko is?No.Sax shrugged.It appeared he was distracted by a talk he had to give that evening.So John decided to wait, and that evening he attended the talk with the rest of the lake station occupants.Sax assured the crowd that atmospheric, surface, and permafrost microbacteria were growing at a rate that was a significant fraction of their theoretical maximums about at 2 percent, to be precise and that they were going to have to be considering the problems of outdoor cultivation within a few decades.Applause at this announcement was nonexistent, because everyone there was absorbed by horrible problems engendered by the Great Storm, which they seemed to think had begun as a result of a miscalculation of Saxs.Surface insolation was still 25 percent normal, as one of them waspishly pointed out, and the storm was showing no signs of ending.Temperatures had dropped, and tempers were rising.All the new arrivals had never seen more than a few meters around them, and psychological problems ranging from ennui to catatonia were pandemic.Sax dismissed all that with a mild shrug.Its the last global storm, he said.It will go down in history as some kind of heroic age.Enjoy it while it lasts.This was poorly received.Sax, however, did not notice.A few days later, Ann and Simon drove into the settlement with their boy Peter, who was now three.He had been, so far as they could tell, the thirty third child born on Mars; the colonies established after the first hundred had been fairly prolific.John played with the boy on the floor as he and Ann and Simon caught up on news, and exchanged some of the thousand and one tales of the Great Storm.It seemed to John that Ann ought to be enjoying the storm and the horrendous knock it had put on the terraforming process, like some kind of planetary allergic response, the temperatures plummeting below the baseline, the reckless experimenters struggling with their puny clogged machines....But she was not amused.Irritated as usual, in fact.A dowsing team drilled into a volcanic vent in Daedalia and came up with a sample containing unicellular microorganisms significantly different from the cyanobacteria you released in the north.And the vent was pretty nearly encased in bedrock, and very far from any biotic release sites.They sent samples of the stuff up to Acheron for analysis, and Vlad studied it and declared that it looked like a mutant strain of one of their releases, perhaps injected into the sample rock by contaminated drilling equipment.Ann poked John in the chest:   Probably Terran, Vlad said.Probably Terran!Probabry tewwan!her little boy said, catching Anns intonation perfectly.Well, it probably is, John said.But well never know!Theyll end up debating it for centuries to come, therell be a journal devoted to that issue alone, but well never really know.If its too close to tell, its probably Terran, John said, grinning at the boy.Anything that evolved separately from Terran life would give itself away in an instant.Probably, Ann said.(Probabry. )Except what if theres a common source, the space spores theory, for instance, or ejecta blasted from one planet to another with microorganisms buried in its rock?Thats not too likely, is it?We dont know.Well never know, now.John had a hard time sharing her concern.They might have come from the Viking landers for all we know, he said.Theres never been a very effective effort to sterilize our explorations here, thats just the way it is.Meanwhile weve got more pressing problems.Such as a global dust storm longer than the longest one ever recorded, or an influx of immigrants whose commitment to Mars was as minimal as their housing, or an upcoming treaty revision that no one could agree on, or a terraforming effort that a lot of people hated.Or a home planet going critical.Or an attempt (or two) to do one John Boone some harm.Yeah yeah, Ann said.I know.But all thats politics, well never get away from that.This was science, a question I wanted answered.And now I cant.Nobody can.John shrugged.Well never answer that one, Ann.No matter what.That was one of those questions that was fated always to remain unanswered.Didnt you know that?Probabwy Tewwan.A few days after that, a rocket landed on the little lake station spaceport pad, and a small group of Terrans emerged out of the dust, still bouncing around as they walked.Investigative agents, they said, here on UNOMA authority, to look into sabotage and related incidents.There were ten of them in all, eight clean cut young men right out of the vids, and two attractive young women.Most had been assigned from the American FBI.Their leader, a tall brown haired man named Sam Houston, requested an interview with Boone, and John agreed politely.When they met after breakfast the next morning six of the agents were there, including both women he meekly answered every question without hesitation, though instinctively he told them only what he thought they knew already, plus a bit more to seem honest and helpful.They were polite and deferential, thorough in their questioning, extremely reticent if he asked them anything in return.They seemed unaware of much of the detail of the situation on Mars, and asked him about things that had happened in the first years at Underhill, or during the time of Hirokos disappearance.They obviously knew the events of that time, and the basic facts of the various relationships among the first hundreds media stars; they asked him a lot of questions about Maya, Phyllis, Arkady, Nadia, the Acheron group, Sax ...all of whom were well known to these young Terrans, permanent fixtures on their TV.But it seemed they knew little beyond what had been taped and sent back to Earth.John, his mind wandering, wondered if that would be true of all Terrans.After all what other sources of information did they have?At the end of the interview, one of them named Chang asked him if there was anything else he wanted to say.John, who had omitted an account of his midnight visit from the coyote, among many other things, said, I cant think of anything!Chang nodded, and then Sam Houston said, Wed appreciate it if youd give us access to your AI on these matters.Im sorry, John said, looking apologetic.I dont give access to my AI.You have a destruct lock on it?Houston said, looking surprised.No.I just dont do it.Those are my private records.John stared the man in the eye, watched him squirm under the gaze of his associates.We, um, we can get a warrant from UNOMA, if you like.I doubt you can, actually.And even if you do I wont let you in.John smiled at him, almost laughed.Another moment where being the First Man On Mars was useful.There was nothing they could do to him without causing far more trouble than it was worth.He stood up and surveyed the little gang with as much easy arrogance as he could muster, which was quite a lot.Let me know if theres anything else I can do for you.He left the room.Pauline, click into the building comm center and copy anything you can that they send out.He called Helmut, remembering that his own calls would be opened as well.He kept his questions brief, as if just checking credentials.Yes, a team had been sent out by UNOMA.They were part of a task force, assembled in the last six months to deal with problems.Police on Mars, then, as well as a detective.Well, it was to be expected.But it was a nuisance nevertheless.He couldnt do much with them hanging around watching him, suspicious because he hadnt given them access to Pauline.And really there wasnt that much to do in Hellas anyway.There had been no incidents of sabotage there, and it seemed unlikely that any would occur now.Maya was unsympathetic, she didnt want to be bothered with his problems, she had enough problems of her own, with the technical aspects of the aquifer project.Youre probably their chief suspect, she said irritably.These things keep happening to you, a truck in Thaumasia, a well at Bakhuysen, and now you wont let them into your records.Why dont you just do it?Because I dont like them, John said, glaring at her.It was back to normal with Maya.Well, not really; they went through their routines in a kind of high spirits, as if playing a good role in the theater, knowing they had time for everything, knowing now what was real, what lay at the base of the relationship.So in that sense it was much better.On the surface, however, it was the same old melodrama.Maya refused to understand, and in the end John gave up.After that he spent a couple of days thinking it over.He went down to the stations labs, and had the sample of skin taken from under his fingernails cultured, cloned, and read.No one with that genome was in the planetary records, so he sent the information to Acheron requesting an analysis and any information they could give.Ursula sent their results back coded, with a single word added at the end.Congratulations.He read the message again, swore out loud.He went out for a walk, alternately laughing and swearing.Damn you, Hiroko!Damn you to hell!Get out of your hole and help us!Ah, ha ha ha!You bitch!Im sick of this Persephone shit!Even the walktubes were oppressive at that moment, and he went to the garage and suited up, and went out the lock for a walk outside, the first in many days.He was out at the end of the northern arm of the town, on a smooth desert floor.He wandered around, staying within the fluctuating column of dust free air that every city created, thinking the situation over as he surveyed the city.Hellas was going to be much less impressive than Burroughs, or Acheron, or Echus, or even Senzeni Na; located at the low point of the basin, it had no heights to build on, no prospect.Although the whipping dust made it a poor time to judge that.The town had been built in a crescent which would eventually become the shoreline of the new lake.That might look nice when it happened a waterfront but meanwhile it was as featureless as Underhill, with all the latest in power plant and service apparatus, intake vents, cables, tunnels like giant sloughed snakeskins ...the old scientific station look, no aesthetics involved.Well, that was fine.They couldnt put every town on a mountaintop.Two people passed him, their faceplates polarized.Odd, he thought, it being so gloomy in the storm.Then they leaped on him, knocked him down.He shoved off the sand with a wild John Carter leap and threw his fists around him, but to his surprise they were running off into the clouds of dust whipping by.He staggered, stared after them.They disappeared behind the veils of dust.His blood jolted through him; then he felt his shoulders burn.He reached up and back; they had cut his walker open.He pressed his hand over the rip and began to run hard.He couldnt feel his shoulders at all anymore.It was awkward to run with his arm up and behind his neck.His air supply appeared to be all right no a tear in the tube, at the neck.He took his hand from his shoulder long enough to dial maximum flow on his wristpad.The cold flowed down his back like ghost ice water.A hundred below zero Centigrade.He was holding his breath and could feel dust on his lips, caking his mouth.Impossible to tell how much CO2 was getting into his oxygen supply, but it didnt take much to kill you.The garage appeared out of the murk; he had run right to it, and was feeling mighty pleased with himself until he came to the lock door and pushed the open button and nothing happened.It was easy to lock a locks outer door, just leave the inner one open.His lungs burned, he needed a breath.He ran around the garage to the walktube that connected it to the habitat proper, reached it, stared in through the layers of plastic.No one in sight.He took his hand away from the rip on his shoulder and as quickly as he could opened the box on his left forearm and took out the little drill, turned it on and plunged it into the plastic, which gave without breaking and gathered up around the spinning bit, until the drill almost broke his elbow.He poked wildly with it and finally got the plastic to tear, then ripped downward, widening the hole until he could dive through it helmet first.When he was inside to the waist he held still, using his body as a rough plug for the hole.He unclipped his helmet and ripped it off his head and gasped for breath as if coming up from a long dive, out in out in out in.Get that CO2 out of the blood.His shoulders and neck were numb.Down at the garage an alarm bell was ringing.After a twenty second compressed burst of thought, he yanked his legs through the hole and ran down the quickly depressurizing tube toward the habitat, away from the garage.Happily the door there opened on command.Once inside he jumped in an elevator and dropped to the third floor below the ground, where he was staying in one of the guest suites.He let the elevator door open and looked out.No one in sight.He hustled down to his room.Inside he stripped off the walker and stashed it and the helmet in his closet.In the bathroom he winced at the sight of his whitened shoulders and upper back; a really horrible case of frostnip.He took some oral painkiller and a triple dose of omegendorph, put on a shirt with a collar, pants, shoes.He combed his hair, composed himself.The face in the mirror looked glassy eyed and distracted, almost stunned.He threw his face through the most violent contortions, slapped it, resettled his expression, started breathing in a deep pattern.The drugs began to kick in, and his reflection looked a little better.He went out into the hall and walked to the big trench wall concourse, which extended downward three more stories.He walked along the railing looking at the people below, feeling a curious mixture of elation and rage.Then Sam Houston and one of his women colleagues approached him.Excuse me, Mr.Boone, but will you please come with us?Whats up?he said.Theres been another incident.Someone cut open one of the walkway tubes.Cut open a walktube?You call that an incident?We have mirror satellites flying out of orbit, and trucks falling into moholes, and youre calling a prank like that an incident?Houston glared at him, and Boone almost laughed at the man.How do you think I can help?he asked.We know youve been working on this for Dr.Russell.We thought you might like to be informed.Oh, I see.Well, lets go have a look then.And then it was a matter of going through the paces, for nearly two hours, his shoulders burning like fire the whole time.Houston and Chang and the other investigators spoke to him as if in confidence, and anxious for his input, but their gazes were coolly evaluative.John returned them with a little smile.Why now, I wonder?Houston said at one point.Maybe someone doesnt like you being here, John said.Only when the whole charade was finished did he have time to think about why he wanted to keep them from finding out about the attack.No doubt it would have drawn more investigators up, and that was bad; and certainly it would have become the top news story all over Mars and Earth, tossing him back into maximum fishbowl.And he was sick of the fishbowl.But there was something more than that, that he couldnt quite pin.The subconscious detective.He snorted with disgust.To distract himself from the pain he stalked around from dining hall to dining hall, hoping to catch some expression of poorly concealed surprise when he walked into each room.Back from the dead!Which one of you murdered me!And once or twice he saw someone flinch from his roving gaze.But the fact was, he thought dourly, many people flinched when he looked at them.As if avoiding the gaze of a freak, or a condemned man.He had never felt his fame in quite that way before, and it made him angry.The painkillers were wearing off, and he returned early to his rooms.His door was open.When he rushed in he found two of the UNOMA investigators inside.What are you doing!he cried angrily.Just looking out for you, one of them said smoothly.They glanced at each other.Wouldnt want someone to try something.Like breaking and entering?Boone said, standing in the doorway and leaning against it.Part of the job, sir.Sorry weve upset you.They shuffled nervously, trapped in his room.Just who gave you authorization for this?Boone said, folding his arms over his chest.Well.They looked at each other again.Mr.Houston is our superior officer  Call him and get him here.One of them whispered into his wristpad.In a suspiciously short time Sam Houston appeared down the hallway, and as he hurried up glowering John laughed.What were you doing, hiding around the corner?Houston walked right up to him and stuck his face forward, and said in a low voice, Look, Mr.Boone, were in the midst of a very important investigation here, and you are obstructing it.Despite what you seem to believe you are not above the law  Boone jerked forward so that Houston had to flinch to avoid their bumping noses.You arent the law, he said.He unfolded his arms and poked Houston in the chest, driving him back farther down the hall.Now Houston was losing his temper, and Boone laughed at him.What are you going to do to me, officer?Arrest me?Threaten me?Give me something good to include in my next report on Eurovid?Would you like that?Would you like me to show the world how John Boone was harassed by some tin god tin badge functionary who came to Mars thinking he was a sheriff in the Wild West?He remembered his opinion that anyone who spoke of themselves in the third person was a self declared idiot, and laughed and said, John Boone doesnt like that kind of thing!No he doesnt!The other two had taken the opportunity to slip out of his room, and were now watching closely.Houstons face was the color of Ascraeus Mons, and his teeth were revealed.No ones above the law, he grated.There are criminal acts occurring here, very dangerous ones, and quite a few of them happen when youre around.Like breaking and entering.If we determine that we need to check your quarters, or your records, to pursue our investigation, then were going to do that.We have that authority.I say you dont, John said arrogantly, and snapped his fingers in the mans face.We are going to search your rooms, Houston said, articulating each word very carefully.Get away, Boone said contemptuously, and jerked at the other two and waved them back.He laughed, lip curled with scorn: Thats right, go!Get out of here, you incompetents go back and read the regs on search and seizure!He went in his room and closed the door behind him.He paused.It sounded like they were leaving, but either way he had to act like he didnt care.He laughed, and went to the bathroom and took some more painkillers.They hadnt yet gotten to the closet, which was lucky; it would have been hard to explain the torn walker without telling the truth, and that would have been messy.Curious how tangled things got when you concealed the fact that someone had tried to kill you.That made him pause.The attempt had been pretty clumsy, after all.There must have been a hundred more effective ways to kill someone out in a walker on Mars.So if they were just trying to scare him, or were perhaps hoping that he would try to conceal the attack, so that they could find him lying, and then have something on him  He shook his head, confused.Occams razor, Occams razor.The detectives primary tool.If someone attacks you they mean you harm, that was the basic, the fundamental fact.It was important to find out who the attackers were.And so on.The painkillers were strong, and the omegendorph was wearing off.It was getting hard to think.It was going to be a problem disposing of the walker; the helmet in particular was a big bulky thing.But now he was into it, and there was no graceful way out.He laughed; he knew he would think of something eventually.He wanted to talk to Arkady.A call determined that Arkady had finished the gerontological treatment in Acheron with Nadia, however, and had gone up to Phobos.John had still never visited the fast little moon.Why dont you come on up and see it?Arkady said over the phone.Better to talk in person, yes?Okay.He hadnt been in space since the landing from the Ares twenty three years before, and the familiar sensations of acceleration and weightlessness brought on an unexpected bout of nausea.He told Arkady about it as they docked with Phobos, and Arkady said, It always used to happen to me, until I started drinking vodka right before takeoff.He had a long physiological explanation for this, but the details began to pull John back over the edge and he cut him off.Arkady laughed; the gerontological treatment had given him its usual postoperative lift, and he had been a happy man to begin with; he looked like he wouldnt be sick again for a thousand years.Stickney turned out to be a bustling little town, the craters concrete dome lined with the latest heavy duty radiation proofing, and the floor of the crater terraced in concentric rings down to a bottom plaza.The rings alternated between parks and two storied buildings with gardens on their roofs.There were nets in the air for people who lost control of their leaps across the city, or took off by accident; escape velocity was only fifty kilometers per hour, so it was almost possible to run right off the moon.Just under the dome foundation John spotted a small version of the exterior circumnavigating train, running horizontally compared to the buildings of the town, and moving at a speed that returned its passengers to a sensation of Martian gravity.It stopped four times a day to take people on, but if John took refuge in it that would only delay his acclimatization, so he went to the guest room assigned to him, and miserably waited out the nausea.It seemed he was a planet dweller now, a Martian for good, so that leaving Mars was pain.Ridiculous but true.The next day he felt better, and Arkady took him on a tour of Phobos.The interior was honeycombed with tunnels, galleries, drifts, and several enormous open chambers, many of them still being mined for water and fuel.Most of the interior tunnels inside the moon were smooth functional tubes, but the interior rooms and some of the big galleries had been built according to Arkadys socio architectural theories, and he showed John around some of these: circular hallways, mixed work and recreation areas, terracing, etched metallic walls, all features that had become standard during Marss crater oriented phase of construction, but of which Arkady was still proud.Three of the little surface craters on the side opposite to Stickney had been domed with glass and filled with villages which had a view of the planet rushing beneath them views never available from Stickney, as Phoboss long axis was permanently aligned toward Mars, with the big crater always pointed away.Arkady and John stood in Semenov, looking up through the dome at Mars, which filled half the sky and was shrouded by its dust clouds, all its features obscured.The Great Storm, Arkady said.Sax must be going mad.No, John said.A thing of the moment, he says.A glitch.Arkady hooted.Already the two of them had fallen back into their old easy camaraderie, the feeling that they were equals, brothers from way back.Arkady was the same as ever, laughing, joking, a great kidder, ideas and opinions flooding out of him, confident in a way that John enjoyed immensely, even now, when he was sure many of Arkadys ideas were wrong, and even dangerous.Sax is probably right, in fact, Arkady said.If those aging treatments work, and we are living decades longer than previously, it will certainly cause a social revolution.Shortness of life was a primary force in the permanence of institutions, strange though it is to say it.But it is so much easier to hold onto whatever short term survival scheme you have, rather than risking it all on a new plan that might not work no matter how destructive your short term plan might be for the following generations.Let them deal with it, you know.And really, to give them their due, by the time people learned the system they were old and dying, and for the next generation it was all there, massive and entrenched and having to be learned all over again.But look, if you learn it, and then stare at it for fifty more years, you will eventually be saying, Why not make this more rational?Why not make it closer to our hearts desire?Whats stopping us?Maybe thats why things are getting so strange down there, John said.But somehow I dont think these people are taking the long view.He gave Arkady a quick account of the sabotage situation, and ended it by saying boldly: Do you know whos doing it, Arkady?Are you involved?What, me?No, John, you know me better than that.These destructions are stupid.The work of reds, from the look of it, and I am no red.I dont know exactly who is doing it.Probably Ann does, have you asked her?She says she doesnt know.Arkady cackled.Still my same John Boone!I love it.Look here, my friend, I will tell you why these things are happening, and then you can work at it systematically, and perhaps see more.Ah, heres the subway to Stickney come on, I want to show you the infinity vault, its really a nice piece of work.He led John to the little subway car, and they floated down a tunnel to near the center of Phobos, where the car stopped and they got out.They pushed across the narrow room, and pulled themselves down a hall; John noted that his body had adjusted to the weightlessness, that he could float and keep his trim again.Arkady led him into an expansive open gallery, which on first glance appeared to be too large to be contained inside of Phobos: floor, wall and ceiling were paneled in faceted mirrors, and each round slab of polished magnesium had been angled so that anyone in its microgravity space was reflected in thousands of infinite regresses.They touched down on the floor and hooked their toes through rings, floating like sea bottom plants in a shifting crowd of Arkadys and Johns.You see, John, the economic basis of life on Mars is now changing, Arkady said.No, dont you dare scoff!So far we have not been living in a money economy, thats the way scientific stations are.Its like winning a prize that frees you from the economic wheel.We won that prize, and so did a lot of others, and weve all been here for years now, living that way.But now more people are flooding onto Mars, thousands of them!And many of them plan to work here, make some money, and return to Earth.They work for the transnationals that have gotten UNOMA concessions.The letter of the Mars treaty is being kept because supposedly UNOMA is in charge of it all, but the spirit of the treaty is being broken left and right, by the U. N.  itself.John was nodding.Yes, Ive seen that.Helmut told me about it right to my face.Helmut is a snail.But listen, when the treaty renewal comes up, they will change the letter of the law to match the new spirit.Or even give themselves license to do more.Its the discovery of strategic metals, and all the open space.These represent salvation to a lot of countries down there, and new territory for the transnationals.And you think theyll have enough support to change the treaty?Millions of Arkadys stared bug eyed at millions of John.Dont be so nave!Of course they have enough support!Look, the Mars treaty is based on the old Outer Space treaty.That was the first mistake, because the Outer Space treaty was in fact a very fragile arrangement, and so the Mars treaty is too.According to the treatys own provisions, countries can become voting members of the treaty council by establishing an interest here, which is why were seeing all the new national scientific stations, the Arab League, Nigeria, Indonesia, Azania, Brazil, India and China and all the rest.And quite a few of these new countries are becoming treaty members specifically with the intent to break the treaty at renewal time.They want to open up Mars to individual governments, outside U. N.  control.And the transnationals are using flag of convenience countries like Singapore and the Seychelles and Moldavia to try to open Mars to private settlement, ruled by corporations.The renewal is still a few years off, John said.A million Arkadys rolled their eyes.Its happening now.Not just in talk, but in whats happening day to day down there.When we first arrived, and for twenty years after that, Mars was like Antarctica but even purer.We were outside the world, we didnt even own things some clothes, a lectern, and that was it!Now you know what I think, John.This arrangement resembles the prehistoric way to live, and it therefore feels right to us, because our brains recognize it from three millions of years practicing it.In essence our brains grew to their current configuration in response to the realities of that life.So as a result people grow powerfully attached to that kind of life, when they get the chance to live it.It allows you to concentrate your attention on the real work, which means everything that is done to stay alive, or make things, or satisfy ones curiosity, or play.That is utopia, John, especially for primitives and scientists, which is to say everybody.So a scientific research station is actually a little model of prehistoric utopia, carved out of the transnational money economy by clever primates who want to live well.Youd think everyone would join, John said.Yes, and they might, but it isnt being offered to them.And that means it wasnt a true utopia.We clever primate scientists were willing to carve out islands for ourselves, rather than work to create such conditions for everyone.And so in reality, the islands are part of the transnational order.They are paid for, they are never truly free, there is never a case of truly pure research.Because the people who pay for the scientist islands will eventually want a return on their investment.And now we are entering that time.A return is being demanded for our island.We were not doing pure research, you see, but applied research.And with the discovery of strategic metals the application has become clear.And so it all comes back, and we have a return of ownership, and prices, and wages.The whole profit system.The little scientific station is being turned into a mine, with the usual mining attitude toward the land over the treasure.And the scientists are being asked, What you do, how much is it worth?They are being asked to do their work for pay, and the profit of their work is to be given over to the owners of the businesses they are suddenly working for.I dont work for anyone, John said.Well, but you work on the terraforming project, and who pays for that?John tried out Saxs answer: The sun.Arkady hooted.Wrong!Its not just the sun and some robots, its human time, a lot of it.And those humans have to eat and so on.And so someone is providing for them, for us, because we have not bothered to set up a life where we provide for ourselves.John frowned.Well, in the beginning we had to have the help.That was billions of dollars of equipment flown up here.Lots of work time, like you say.Yes, its true.But once we arrived we could have focused all our efforts on making ourselves self sufficient and independent, and then paid them back and been done with them.But we didnt, and now the loan sharks are here.Look, back in the beginning, if someone were to ask us who made more money, you or me, it would have been impossible to say, right?Right.A meaningless question.But now you ask, and we have to confer.Do you consult for anybody?Nobody.Me neither.But Phyllis consults for Amex, and Subarashii, and Armscor.And Frank consults for Honey well Messerschmidt, and GE, and Boeing, and Subarashii.And so on.They are richer than us.And in this system, richer is more powerful.Well just see about that, John thought.But he didnt want to make Arkady laugh again, so he didnt say it.And it is happening everywhere on Mars, Arkady said.Around them clouds of Arkadys waved their arms, looking like a Tibetan mandala of red haired demons.And naturally there are people who notice whats going on.Or I tell them.And this is what you must understand, John there are people who will fight to keep things the way they were.There are people who loved the feel of life as a scientist primitive, so much that they will refuse to give it up without a fight.So the sabotages ...Yes!Perhaps some of them are done by these people.It is counterproductive, I think, but they dont agree.Mostly the sabotage is done by people who want to keep Mars the way it was before we arrived.I am not one of those.But I am one of those who will fight to keep Mars from becoming a free zone for transnational mining.To keep us all from becoming happy slaves for some executive class, walled in its fortress mansion.He faced John, and out of the corner of his eye John saw around them an infinity of confrontations.Dont you feel the same?I do, actually.He grinned.I do!I think if we disagree, its mostly on the matter of methods.What methods do you propose to use?Well basically, I want to get the treaty renewed as it stands, and then adhered to.If that happens then well have what we want, or well have the basis for getting to full independence, at least.The treaty will not be renewed, Arkady said flatly.It will take something much more radical to stop these people, John.Direct action yes, dont you look so unbelieving!Seizure of some property, or of the communication system the institution of our own set of laws, backed by everyone here, out in the streets yes, John, yes!It will come to that, because there are guns under the table.Mass demonstration and insurrection are the only things that will beat them, history shows this.A million Arkadys clustered around John, looking graver than any Arkady he could ever remember seeing so grave that the blossoming rows of Johns own face exhibited a regressive expression of slack jawed concern.He pulled his mouth shut.Id like to try my way first, he said.Which made all the Arkadys laugh.John gave him a playful shove on the arm and Arkady went to the floor, then pushed off and tackled him.They wrestled while they could keep contact and then flew away to opposite sides of the chamber; in the mirrors, millions of them flew away into infinity.After that they went back to the subway, and to dinner in Semenov.As they ate they looked up at the surface of Mars, swirled like a gas giant.Suddenly it looked to John like a great orange cell, or embryo, or egg.Chromosomes whipping about under a mottled orange shell.A new creature waiting to be born, genetically engineered for sure; and they were the engineers, still working on what kind of creature it would be.They were all trying to clip the genes they wanted (their own) onto plasmids and insert them into the planets DNA spirals, to get the expressions they wanted from the new chimerical beast.Yes.And John liked much of what Arkady wanted to put into it.But he had his own ideas as well.They would see who managed to create more of the genome in the end.He glanced at Arkady, who was also looking up at the sky filling planet, with the same grave expression that had been on his face in the hall of mirrors.It was a look that had been impressed on John very accurately and powerfully, he found, but in a weird multiple flys vision format.John descended back into the murk of the Great Storm, and down in the dim blustery sand swept days he saw things he hadnt seen before.That was the value of talking with Arkady.He paid attention to things in a new way; he traveled south from Burroughs, for instance, to Sabishii (Lonely) Mohole, and visited the Japanese who lived there.They were old timers, the Japanese equivalent of the first hundred, on Mars only seven years after the first hundred had arrived; and unlike the first hundred they had become a very tight unit, and had gone native in a big way.Sabishii had remained small, even after the mohole was dug there.It was out in a region of rough boulders near Jarry Desloges Crater, and as he drove down the last part of the transponder trail to the settlement, John caught brief glimpses of boulders carved into oversized faces or figures, or covered with elaborate pictographs, or hollowed out into little Shinto or Zen shrines.He stared in the dustclouds after these visions, but they were always gone like hallucinations, half seen and then disappeared.As he passed into the tattered zone of clear air directly downwind from the mohole, he noticed that the Sabishiians were taking the rock hauled out of the great shaft to this area and arranging it into curving mounds a pattern from space it would look like, what, a dragon?And then he arrived at the garage and was greeted by a group of them, barefoot and long haired, in frayed tan jumpers or sumo wrestler jock straps: wizened old Japanese Martian sages, who talked about the kami centers in the region, and how their deepest sense of on had long ago shifted from the emperor to the planet.They showed him their labs, where they were working on areobotany and radiation proofed clothing materials.They had also done extensive work on aquifer location, and climatology in the equatorial belt.Listening to them it seemed to John that they just had to be in touch with Hiroko, it didnt make sense that they werent.But they shrugged when he asked about her.John went to work drawing them out, establishing the atmosphere of trust that he was so often able to generate in old timers, the sense that they went back a long way together, into their own Noachian.A couple of days of asking questions, of learning the town, of showing that he was a man who knew giri, and slowly they began to open up, telling him in a quiet but blunt way that they did not like the sudden growth of Burroughs, nor the mohole next to them, nor the population increase in general, nor the new pressures put on them by the Japanese government, to survey the Great Escarpment and find gold.We refuse, said Nanao Nakayama, a wrinkled old man with scraggly white whiskers and turquoise earrings, and long white hair in a ponytail.They cannot make us.And if they try?John asked.They will fail.His easy assurance caught Johns attention; and John remembered the conversation with Arkady among the mirrors.So some of the things he now saw were the result of paying attention in a new way, of asking new questions.But others were the result of Arkady sending word down through his network of friends and acquaintances, to identify themselves to John and show him around.Thus when John stopped in settlements on the way from Sabishii to Senzeni Na, he was often approached by small groups of two, or three, or five, who introduced themselves and said, Arkady thought you might be interested to see this....
