The food particles compressed to less than half their original size, but the oil was barely affected at all.This changed the volume ratio of solid to liquid dramatically, which in turn made the aggregate act as a liquid.Known as liquefaction, this process transformed the protein cubes from a steady solid into a flowing sludge.Stored in a compartment that originally had no leftover space, the now compressed sludge had room to slosh.The shimmy also caused an imbalanced load, forcing the sludge toward the edge of its compartment.This shift in weight only aggravated the larger problem, and the shimmy grew stronger.*  Shimmys getting violent, reported the ascent flight director.How violent?Mitch said.More than we like, he said.But the accelerometers caught it and calculated the new center of mass.The guidance computer is adjusting the engines thrusts to counteract.Were still good.Keep me posted, Mitch said.Thirteen seconds till staging.The unexpected weight shift had not spelled disaster.All systems were designed for worst case scenarios; each did its job admirably.The ship continued toward orbit with only a minor course adjustment, implemented automatically by sophisticated software.The first stage depleted its fuel, and the booster coasted for a fraction of a second as it jettisoned stage clamps via explosive bolts.The now empty stage fell away from the craft as the second stage engines prepared to ignite.The brutal forces had disappeared.The protein sludge floated free in the container.Given two seconds, it would have re expanded and solidified.But it was given only a quarter second.As the second stage fired, the craft experienced a sudden jolt of immense force.No longer contending with the deadweight of the first stage, the acceleration was profound.The three hundred kilograms of sludge slammed into the back of its container.The point of impact was at the edge of Iris, nowhere near where the mass was expected to be.Though Iris was held in place by five large bolts, the force was directed entirely to a single one.The bolt was designed to withstand immense forces; if necessary to carry the entire weight of the payload.But it was not designed to sustain a sudden impact from a loose three hundred kilogram mass.The bolt sheared.The burden was then shifted to the remaining four bolts.The forceful impact having passed, their work was considerably easier than that of their fallen comrade.Had the pad crew been given time to do normal inspections, they would have noticed the minor defect in one of the bolts.A defect that slightly weakened it, though it would not cause failure on a normal mission.Still, they would have swapped it out with a perfect replacement.The off center load presented unequal force to the four remaining bolts, the defective one bearing the brunt of it.Soon, it failed as well.From there, the other three failed in rapid succession.Iris slipped from its supports in the aeroshell, slamming into the hull.*  Woah!exclaimed the ascent flight director.Flight, were getting a large precession!What?Mitch said as alerts beeped and lights flashed across all the consoles.Force on Iris is at seven gs, someone said.Intermittent signal loss, called another voice.Ascent, whats happening here?Mitch demanded.All hell broke loose.Its spinning on the long axis with a seventeen degree precession.How bad?At least five rps, and falling off course.Can you get it to orbit?I cant talk to it at all; signal failures left and right.Comm!Mitch shot to the communications director.Workin on it, Flight, was the response.Theres a problem with the onboard system.Getting some major gs inside, Flight.Ground telemetry shows it two hundred meters low of target path.Weve lost readings on the probe, Flight.Entirely lost the probe?he asked.Affirm, Flight.Intermittent signal from the ship, but no probe.Shit, Mitch said.It shook loose in the aeroshell.Its dreideling, Flight.Can it limp to orbit?Mitch said.Even super low EO?We might be able to  Loss of signal, Flight.LOS here, too.Same here.Other than the alarms, the room fell silent.After a moment, Mitch said, Reestablish?No luck, said Comm.Ground?Mitch asked.GC was the reply.Vehicle had already left visual range.SatCon?Mitch asked.No satellite acquisition of signal.Mitch looked forward to the main screen.It was black now, with large white letters reading LOS.Flight, a voice said over the radio, US destroyer Stockton reports debris falling from the sky.Source matches last known location of Iris.Mitch put his head in his hands.Roger, he said.Then he uttered the words every flight director hopes never to say: GC, Flight.Lock the doors.It was the signal to start post failure procedures.From the VIP observation room, Teddy watched the despondent Mission Control Center.He took a deep breath, then let it out.He looked forlornly at the blue folder that contained his cheerful speech praising a perfect launch.He placed it in his briefcase and extracted the red folder, with the other speech in it.*  Venkat stared out his office windows to the space center beyond.A space center that housed mankinds most advanced knowledge of rocketry yet had still failed to execute todays launch.His mobile rang.His wife again.No doubt worried about him.He let it go to voice mail.He just couldnt face her.Or anyone.A chime came from his computer.Glancing over, he saw an e mail from JPL.A relayed message from Pathfinder:  [16:03] WATNEY: Howd the launch go?Chapter 16   Martinez:  Dr.Shields says I need to write personal messages to each of the crew.She says itll keep me tethered to humanity.I think its bullshit.But hey, its an order.With you, I can be blunt:  If I die, I need you to check on my parents.Theyll want to hear about our time on Mars firsthand.Ill need you to do that.It wont be easy talking to a couple about their dead son.Its a lot to ask; thats why Im asking you.Id tell you youre my best friend and stuff, but it would be lame.Im not giving up.Just planning for every outcome.Its what I do.*  Guo Ming, director of the China National Space Administration, examined the daunting pile of paperwork at his desk.In the old days, when China wanted to launch a rocket, they just launched it.Now they were compelled by international agreements to warn other nations first.It was a requirement, Guo Ming noted to himself, that did not apply to the United States.To be fair, the Americans publicly announced their launch schedules well in advance, so it amounted to the same thing.He walked a fine line filling out the form: making the launch date and flight path clear, while doing everything possible to conceal state secrets.He snorted at the last requirement.Ridiculous, he mumbled.The Taiyang Shen had no strategic or military value.It was an unmanned probe that would be in Earth orbit less than two days.After that, it would travel to a solar orbit between Mercury and Venus.It would be Chinas first heliology probe to orbit the sun.Yet the State Council insisted all launches be shrouded in secrecy.Even launches with nothing to hide.This way, other nations could not infer from lack of openness which launches contained classified payloads.A knock at the door interrupted his paperwork.Come, Guo Ming said, happy for the interruption.Good evening, sir, said Under Director Zhu Tao.Tao, welcome back.Thank you, sir.Its good to be back in Beijing.How were things at Jiuquan?asked Guo Ming.Not too cold, I hope?Ill never understand why our launch complex is in the middle of the Gobi Desert.It was cold, yet manageable, Zhu Tao said.And how are launch preparations coming along?I am happy to report they are all on schedule.Excellent.Guo Ming smiled.Zhu Tao sat quietly, staring at his boss.Guo Ming looked expectantly back at him, but Zhu Tao neither stood to leave nor said anything further.Something else, Tao?Guo Ming asked.Mmm, Zhu Tao said.Of course, youve heard about the Iris probe?Yes, I did, Guo frowned.Terrible situation.That poor mans going to starve.Possibly, Zhu Tao said.Possibly not.Guo Ming leaned back in his chair.What are you saying?Its the Taiyang Shens booster, sir.Our engineers have run the numbers, and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit.It could get there in four hundred and nineteen days.Are you kidding?Have you ever known me to kid, sir?Guo Ming stood and pinched his chin.Pacing, he said, We can really send the Taiyang Shen to Mars?No, sir, said Zhu Tao.Its far too heavy.The massive heat shielding makes it the heaviest unmanned probe weve ever built.Thats why the booster had to be so powerful.But a lighter payload could be sent all the way to Mars.How much mass could we send?Guo Ming asked.Nine hundred and forty one kilograms, sir.Hmm, Guo Ming said, I bet NASA could work with that limitation.Why havent they approached us?Because they dont know, Zhu Tao said.All our booster technology is classified information.The Ministry of State Security even spreads disinformation about our capabilities.This is for obvious reasons.So they dont know we can help them, Guo Ming said.If we decide not to help, no one will know we could have.Correct, sir.For the sake of argument, lets say we decided to help.What then?Time would be the enemy, sir, Zhu Tao answered.Based on travel duration and the supplies their astronaut has remaining, any such probe would have to be launched within a month.Even then he would starve a little.Thats right around when we planned to launch Taiyang Shen.Yes, sir.But it took them two months to build Iris, and it was so rushed it failed.Thats their problem, Guo Ming said.Our end would be providing the booster.Wed launch from Jiuquan; we cant ship an eight hundred ton rocket to Florida.Any agreement would hinge on the Americans reimbursing us for the booster, Zhu Tao said, and the State Council would likely want political favors from the US government.Reimbursement would be pointless, Guo Ming said.This was an expensive project, and the State Council grumbled about it all along.If they had a bulk payout for its value, theyd just keep it.Wed never get to build another one.He clasped his hands behind his back.And the American people may be sentimental, but their government is not.The US State Department wont trade anything major for one mans life.So its hopeless?asked Zhu Tao.Not hopeless, Guo Ming corrected.Just hard.If this becomes a negotiation by diplomats, it will never be resolved.We need to keep this among scientists.Space agency to space agency.Ill get a translator and call NASAs administrator.Well work out an agreement, then present it to our governments as a fait accompli.But what can they do for us?Zhu Tao asked.Wed be giving up a booster and effectively canceling Taiyang Shen.Guo Ming smiled.Theyll give us something we cant get without them.And that is?Theyll put a Chinese astronaut on Mars.Zhu Tao stood.Of course.He smiled.The Ares 5 crew hasnt even been selected yet.Well insist on a crewman.One we get to pick and train.NASA and the US State Department would surely accept that.But will our State Council?Guo Ming smiled wryly.Publicly rescue the Americans?Put a Chinese astronaut on Mars?Have the world see China as equal to the US in space?The State Council would sell their own mothers for that.*  Teddy listened to the phone at his ear.The voice on the other end finished what it had to say, then fell silent as it awaited an answer.He stared at nothing in particular as he processed what hed just heard.After a few seconds, he replied, Yes.*  Johanssen:  Your poster outsold the rest of ours combined.Youre a hot chick who went to Mars.Youre on dorm room walls all over the world.Looking like that, why are you such a nerd?And you are, you know.A serious nerd.I had to do some computer shit to get Pathfinder talking to the rover and oh my god.And I had NASA telling me what to do every step of the way.You should try to be more cool.Wear dark glasses and a leather jacket.Carry a switchblade.Aspire to a level of coolness known only as Botanist Cool.Did you know Commander Lewis had a chat with us men?If anyone hit on you, wed be off the mission.I guess after a lifetime of commanding sailors, shes got an unfairly jaded view.Anyway, the point is youre a nerd.Remind me to give you a wedgie next time I see you.*  Okay, here we are again, said Bruce to the assembled heads of JPL.Youve all heard about the Taiyang Shen, so you know our friends in China have given us one more chance.But this time, its going to be harder.Taiyang Shen will be ready to launch in twenty eight days.If it launches on time, our payload will get to Mars on Sol 624, six weeks after Watneys expected to run out of food.NASAs already working on ways to stretch his supply.We made history when we finished Iris in sixty three days.Now we have to do it in twenty eight.He looked across the table to the incredulous faces.Folks, he said, this is going to be the most ghetto spacecraft ever built.Theres only one way to finish that fast: no landing system.Sorry, what?Jack Trevor stammered.Bruce nodded.You heard me.No landing system.Well need guidance for in flight course adjustments.But once it gets to Mars, its going to crash.Thats crazy!Jack said.Itll be going an insane velocity when it hits!Yep, Bruce said.With ideal atmospheric drag, itll impact at three hundred meters per second.What good will a pulverized probe do Watney?Jack asked.As long as the food doesnt burn up on the way in, Watney can eat it, Bruce said.Turning to the whiteboard, he began drawing a basic organizational chart.I want two teams, he began.Team One will make the outer shell, guidance system, and thrusters.All we need is for it to get to Mars.I want the safest possible system.Aerosol propellant would be best.High gain radio so we can talk to it, and standard satellite navigational software.Team Two will deal with the payload.They need to find a way to contain the food during impact.If protein bars hit sand at three hundred meters per second, theyll make protein scented sand.We need them edible after impact.We can weigh nine hundred and forty one kilograms.At least three hundred of that needs to be food.Get crackin.*  Uh, Dr.Kapoor?Rich said, peeking his head into Venkats office.Do you have a minute?Venkat gestured him in.You are?Rich, Rich Purnell, he said, shuffling into the office, his arms wrapped around a sheaf of disorganized papers.From astrodynamics.Nice to meet you, Venkat said.What can I do for you, Rich?I came up with something a while ago.Spent a lot of time on it.He dumped the papers on Venkats desk.Lemme find the summary  Venkat stared forlornly at his once clean desk, now strewn with scores of printouts.Here we go!Rich said triumphantly, grabbing a paper.Then his expression saddened.No, this isnt it.Rich, Venkat said.Maybe you should just tell me what this is about?Rich looked at the mess of papers and sighed.But I had such a cool summary  A summary for what?How to save Watney.Thats already in progress, Venkat said.Its a last ditch effort, but  The Taiyang Shen?Rich snorted.That wont work.You cant make a Mars probe in a month.Were sure as hell going to try, Venkat said, a note of annoyance in his voice.Oh, sorry, am I being difficult?Rich asked.Im not good with people.Sometimes Im difficult.I wish people would just tell me.Anyway, the Taiyang Shen is critical.In fact, my idea wont work without it.But a Mars probe?Pfft.Cmon.All right, Venkat said.Whats your idea?Rich snatched a paper from the desk.Here it is!He handed it to Venkat with a childlike smile.Venkat took the summary and skimmed it.The more he read, the wider his eyes got.Are you sure about this?Absolutely!Rich beamed.Have you told anyone else?Who would I tell?I dont know, Venkat said.Friends?I dont have any of those.Okay, keep it under your hat.I dont wear a hat.Its just an expression.Really?Rich said.Its a stupid expression.Rich, youre being difficult.Ah.Thanks.*  Vogel:  Being your backup has backfired.I guess NASA figured botany and chemistry are similar because they both end in Y, One way or another, I ended up being your backup chemist.Remember when they made you spend a day explaining your experiments to me?It was in the middle of intense mission prep.You may have forgotten.You started my training by buying me a beer.For breakfast.Germans are awesome.Anyway, now that I have time to kill, NASA gave me a pile of work.And all your chemistry crap is on the list.So now I have to do boring ass experiments with test tubes and soil and pH levels and Zzzzzzzzzz  My life is now a desperate struggle for survival with occasional titration.Frankly, I suspect youre a super villain.Youre a chemist, you have a German accent, you had a base on Mars what more can there be?*  What the fuck is Project Elrond?Annie asked.I had to make something up, Venkat said.So you came up with Elrond?Annie pressed.Because its a secret meeting?Mitch guessed.The e mail said I couldnt even tell my assistant.Ill explain everything once Teddy arrives.Venkat said.Why does Elrond mean secret meeting?Annie asked.Are we going to make a momentous decision?Bruge Ng asked.Exactly, Venkat said.How did you know that?Annie asked, getting annoyed.Elrond, Bruce said.The Council of Elrond.From Lord of the Rings.Its the meeting where they decide to destroy the One Ring.Jesus, Annie said.None of you got laid in high school, did you?Good morning, Teddy said as he walked into the conference room.Seating himself, he rested his hands on the table.Anyone know what this meetings about?he asked.Wait, Mitch said, Teddy doesnt even know?Venkat took a deep breath.One of our astrodynamicists, Rich Purnell, has found a way to get Hermes back to Mars.The course he came up with would give Hermes a Mars flyby on Sol 549.Silence.You shittin us?Annie demanded.Sol 549?Hows that even possible?asked Bruce.Even Iris wouldnt have landed till Sol 588.Iris is a point thrust craft, Venkat said.Hermes has a constant thrust ion engine.Its always accelerating.Also, Hermes has a lot of velocity right now.On their current Earth intercept course, they have to decelerate for the next month just to slow down to Earths speed.Mitch rubbed the back of his head.Wow 549.Thats thirty five sols before Watney runs out of food.That would solve everything.Teddy leaned forward.Run us through it, Venkat.What would it entail?Well, Venkat began, if they did this Rich Purnell Maneuver, theyd start accelerating right away, to preserve their velocity and gain even more.They wouldnt intercept Earth at all, but would come close enough to use a gravity assist to adjust course.Around that time, theyd pick up a resupply probe with provisions for the extended trip.After that, theyd be on an accelerating orbit toward Mars, arriving on Sol 549.Like I said, its a Mary flyby.This isnt anything like a normal Ares mission.Theyll be going too fast to fall into orbit.The rest of the maneuver takes them back to Earth.Theyd be home two hundred and eleven days after the flyby.What good is a flyby?Bruce asked.They dont have any way to get Watney off the surface.Yeah Venkat said.Now for the unpleasant part: Watney would have to get to the Ares 4 MAV.Schiaparelli!?Mitch gaped.Thats thirty two hundred kilometers away!Three thousand, two hundred, and thirty five kilometers to be exact, Venkat said.Its not out of the question.He drove to Pathfinders landing site and back.Thats over fifteen hundred kilometers.That was over flat, desert terrain, Bruce chimed in, but the trip to Schiaparelli  Suffice it to say, Venkat interrupted, it would be very difficult and dangerous.But we have a lot of clever scientists to help him trick out the rover.Also there would be MAV modifications.Whats wrong with the MAV?Mitch asked.Its designed to get to low Mars orbit, Venkat explained.But Hermes would be on a flyby, so the MAV would have to escape Mars gravity entirely to intercept.How?Mitch asked.Itd have to lose weight a lot of weight.I can get rooms full of people working on these problems, if we decide to do this.Earlier, Teddy said, you mentioned a supply probe for Hermes.We have that capability?Yes, with the Taiyang Shen, Venkat said.Wed shoot for a near Earth rendezvous.Its a lot easier than getting a probe to Mars, thats for sure.I see, Teddy said.So we have two options on the table: Send Watney enough food to last until Ares 4, or send Hermes back to get him right now.Both plans require the Taiyang Shen, so we can only do one.Yes, Venkat said.Well have to pick one.They all took a moment to consider.What about the Hermes crew?Annie asked, breaking the silence.Would they have a problem with adding She did some quick math in her head.Five hundred and thirty three days to their mission?They wouldnt hesitate, Mitch said.Not for a second.Thats why Venkat called this meeting.He glared at Venkat.He wants us to decide instead.Thats right, Venkat said.It should be Commander Lewiss call, Mitch said.Pointless to even ask her, Venkat said.We need to make this decision; its a matter of life and death.Shes the mission commander, Mitch said.Life and death decisions are her damn job.Easy, Mitch, Teddy said.Bullshit, Mitch said.You guys have done end runs around the crew every time something goes wrong.You didnt tell them Watney was still alive; now youre not telling them theres a way to save him.We already have a way to keep him alive, Teddy said.Were just discussing another one.The crash lander?Mitch said.Does anyone think thatll work?Anyone?All right, Mitch, Teddy said.Youve expressed your opinion, and weve heard it.Lets move on.He turned to Venkat.Can Hermes function for five hundred and thirty three days beyond the scheduled mission end?It should, Venkat said.The crew may have to fix things here and there, but theyre well trained.Remember, Hermes was made to do all five Ares missions.Its only halfway through its designed life span.Its the most expensive thing ever built, Teddy said.We cant make another one.If something went wrong, the crew would die, and the Ares Program with them.Losing the crew would be a disaster, Venkat said.But we wouldnt lose Hermes.We can remotely operate it.So long as the reactor and ion engines continued to work, we could bring it back.Space travel is dangerous, Mitch said.We cant make this a discussion about whats safest.I disagree, Teddy said.This is absolutely a discussion about whats safest.And about how many lives are at stake.Both plans are risky, but resupplying Watney only risks one life while the Rich Purnell Maneuver risks six.Consider degree of risk, Teddy, Venkat said.Mitch is right.The crash lander is high risk.It could miss Mars, it could reenter wrong and burn up, it could crash too hard and destroy the food We estimate a thirty percent chance of success.A near Earth rendezvous with Hermes is more doable?Teddy asked.Much more doable, Venkat confirmed.With sub second transmission delays, we can control the probe directly from Earth rather than rely on automated systems.When the time comes to dock, Major Martinez can pilot it remotely from Hermes with no transmission delay at all.And Hermes has a human crew, able to overcome any hiccups that may happen.And we dont have to do a reentry; the supplies dont have to survive a three hundred meters per second impact.So, Bruce offered, we can have a high chance of killing one person, or a low chance of killing six people.Jeez.How do we even make this decision?We talk about it, then Teddy makes the decision, Venkat said.Not sure what else we can do.We could let Lewis Mitch began.Yeah, other than that, Venkat interrupted.Question, Annie said.What am I even here for?This seems like something for you nerds to discuss.You need to be in the loop, Venkat said.Were not deciding right now.Well need to quietly research the details internally.Something might leak, and you need to be ready to dance around questions.How long have we got to make a decision?Teddy asked.The window for starting the maneuver ends in thirty nine hours.All right, Teddy said.Everyone, we discuss this only in person or on the phone; never e mail.And dont talk to anyone about this, other than the people here.The last thing we need is public opinion pressing for a risky cowboy rescue that may be impossible.*  Beck:  Hey, man.How ya been?Now that Im in a dire situation, I dont have to follow social rules anymore.I can be honest with everyone.Bearing that in mind, I have to say dude you need to tell Johanssen how you feel.If you dont, youll regret it forever.I wont lie: It could end badly.I have no idea what she thinks of you.Or of anything.Shes weird.But wait till the missions over.Youre on a ship with her for another two months.Also, if you guys got up to anything while the mission was in progress, Lewis would kill you.*  Venkat, Mitch, Annie, Bruce, and Teddy met for the second time in as many days.Project Elrond had taken on a dark connotation throughout the Space Center, veiled in secrecy.Many people knew the name, none knew its purpose.Speculation ran rampant.Some thought it was a completely new program in the works.Others worried it might be a move to cancel Ares 4 and 5.Most thought it was Ares 6 in the works.It wasnt an easy decision, Teddy said to the assembled elite.But Ive decided to go with Iris 2.No Rich Purnell Maneuver.Mitch slammed his fist on the table.Well do all we can to make it work, Bruce said.If its not too much to ask, Venkat began, what made up your mind?Teddy sighed.Its a matter of risk, he said.Iris 2 only risks one life.Rich Purnell risks all six of them.I know Rich Purnell is more likely to work, but I dont think its six times more likely.You coward, Mitch said.Mitch Venkat said.You god damned coward, Mitch continued, ignoring Venkat.You just want to cut your losses.Youre on damage control.You dont give a shit about Watneys life.Of course I do, Teddy replied.And Im sick of your infantile attitude.You can throw all the tantrums you want, but the rest of us have to be adults.This isnt a TV show; the riskier solution isnt always the best.Space is dangerous, Mitch snapped.Its what we do here.If you want to play it safe all the time, go join an insurance company.And by the way, its not even your life youre risking.The crew can make up their own minds about it.No, they cant, Teddy fired back.Theyre too emotionally involved.Clearly, so are you.Im not gambling five additional lives to save one.Especially when we might save him without risking them at all.Bullshit!Mitch shot back as he stood from his chair.Youre just convincing yourself the crash lander will work so you dont have to take a risk.Youre hanging him out to dry, you chickenshit son of a bitch!He stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.After a few seconds, Venkat followed behind, saying, Ill make sure he cools off.Bruce slumped in his chair.Sheesh, he said nervously.Were scientists, for Christs sake.What the hell!?Annie quietly gathered her things and placed them in her briefcase.Teddy looked to her.Sorry about that, Annie, he said.What can I say?Sometimes men let testosterone take over  I was hoping hed kick your ass, she interrupted.What?I know you care about the astronauts, but hes right.You are a fucking coward.If you had balls, we might be able to save Watney.*  Lewis:  Hi, Commander.Between training and our trip to Mars, I spent two years working with you.I think I know you pretty well.So Im guessing you still blame yourself for my situation, despite my earlier e mail asking you not to.You were faced with an impossible scenario and made a tough decision.Thats what commanders do.And your decision was right.If youd waited any longer, the MAV would have tipped.Im sure youve run through all the possible outcomes in your head, so you know theres nothing you could have done differently (other than be psychic).You probably think losing a crewman is the worst thing that can happen.Not true.Losing the whole crew is worse.You kept that from happening.But theres something more important we need to discuss: What is it with you and disco?I can understand the 70s TV because everyone loves hairy people with huge collars.But disco?Disco!?*  Vogel checked the position and orientation of Hermes against the projected path.It matched, as usual.In addition to being the missions chemist, he was also an accomplished astrophysicist.Though his duties as navigator were laughably easy.The computer knew the course.It knew when to angle the ship so the ion engines would be aimed correctly.And it knew the location of the ship at all times (easily calculated from the position of the sun and Earth, and knowing the exact time from an on board atomic clock).Barring a complete computer failure or other critical event, Vogels vast knowledge of astrodynamics would never come into play.After completing the check, he ran a diagnostic on the engines.They were functioning at peak.He did all this from his quarters.All onboard computers could control all ships functions.Gone were the days of physically visiting the engines to check up on them.Having completed his work for the day, he finally had time to read e mail.Sorting through the messages NASA deemed worthy to upload, he read the most interesting first and responded when necessary.His responses were cached and would be sent to Earth with Johanssens next uplink.A message from his wife caught his attention.Titled unsere kinder (our children), it contained nothing but an image attachment.He raised an eyebrow.Several things stood out at once.First, kinder should have been capitalized.Helena, a grammar school teacher in Bremen, was very unlikely to make that mistake.Also, to each other, they affectionately called their kids die Affen.When he tried to open the image, his viewer reported that the file was unreadable.He walked down the narrow hallway.The crew quarters stood against the outer hull of the constantly spinning ship to maximize simulated gravity.Johanssens door was open, as usual.Johanssen.Good evening, Vogel said.The crew kept the same sleep schedule, and it was nearing bedtime.Oh, hello, Johanssen said, looking up from her computer.I have the computer problem, Vogel explained.I wonder if you will help.Sure, she said.You are in the personal time, Vogel said.Perhaps tomorrow when you are on the duty is better?Nows fine, she said.Whats wrong?It is a file.It is an image, but my computer cannot view.Wheres the file?she asked, typing on her keyboard.It is on my shared space.The name is kinder.jpg.Lets take a look, she said.Her fingers flew over her keyboard as windows opened and closed on her screen.Definitely a bad jpg header, she said.Probably mangled in the download.Lemme look with a hex editor, see if we got anything at all  After a few moments she said, This isnt a jpeg.Its a plain ASCII text file.Looks like well, I dont know what it is.Looks like a bunch of math formulae.She gestured to the screen.Does any of this make sense to you?Vogel leaned in, looking at the text.Ja, he said.It is a course maneuver for Hermes.It says the name is Rich Purnell Maneuver.Whats that?Johanssen asked.I have not heard of this maneuver.He looked at the tables.It is complicated very complicated  He froze.Sol 549!?he exclaimed.Mein Gott!*  The Hermes crew enjoyed their scant personal time in an area called the Rec.Consisting of a table and barely room to seat six, it ranked low in gravity priority.Its position amidships granted it a mere 0.2 g.   Still, it was enough to keep everyone in a seat as they pondered what Vogel told them.and then mission would conclude with Earth intercept two hundred and eleven days later, he finished up.Thank you, Vogel, Lewis said.Shed heard the explanation earlier when Vogel came to her, but Johanssen, Martinez, and Beck were hearing it for the first time.She gave them a moment to digest.Would this really work?Martinez asked.Ja.Vogel nodded.I ran the numbers.They all check out.It is brilliant course.Amazing.How would he get off Mars?Martinez asked.Lewis leaned forward.There was more in the message, she began.Wed have to pick up a supply near Earth, and hed have to get to Ares 4s MAV.Why all the cloak and dagger?Beck asked.According to the message, Lewis explained, NASA rejected the idea.Theyd rather take a big risk on Watney than a small risk on all of us.Whoever snuck it into Vogels e mail obviously disagreed.So, Martinez said, were talking about going directly against NASAs decision?Yes, Lewis confirmed, thats exactly what were talking about.If we go through with the maneuver, theyll have to send the supply ship or well die.We have the opportunity to force their hand.Are we going to do it?Johanssen asked.They all looked to Lewis.I wont lie, she said.Id sure as hell like to.But this isnt a normal decision.This is something NASA expressly rejected.Were talking about mutiny.And thats not a word I throw around lightly.She stood and paced slowly around the table.Well only do it if we all agree.And before you answer, consider the consequences.If we mess up the supply rendezvous, we die.If we mess up the Earth gravity assist, we die.If we do everything perfectly, we add five hundred and thirty three days to our mission.Five hundred and thirty three days of unplanned space travel where anything could go wrong.Maintenance will be a hassle.Something might break that we cant fix.If its life critical, we die.Sign me up!Martinez smiled.Easy, cowboy, Lewis said.You and I are military.Theres a good chance wed be court martialed when we got home.As for the rest of you, I guarantee theyll never send you up again.Martinez leaned against the wall, arms folded with a half grin on his face.The rest silently considered what their commander had said.If we do this, Vogel said, it would be over one thousand days of space.This is enough space for a life.I do not need to return.Sounds like Vogels in, Martinez grinned.Me, too, obviously.Lets do it, Beck said.If you think itll work, Johanssen said to Lewis, I trust you.Okay, Lewis said.If we go for it, whats involved?Vogel shrugged.I plot the course and execute it, he said.What else?Remote override, Johanssen said.Its designed to get the ship back if we all die or something.They can take over Hermes from Mission Control.But were right here, Lewis said.We can undo whatever they try, right?Not really, Johanssen said.Remote override takes priority over any onboard controls.It assumes theres been a disaster and the ships control panels cant be trusted.Can you disable it?Lewis asked.Hmm Johanssen pondered.Hermes has four redundant flight computers, each connected to three redundant comm systems.If any computer gets a signal from any comm system, Mission Control can take over.We cant shut down the comms; wed lose telemetry and guidance.We cant shut down the computers; we need them to control the ship.Ill have to disable the remote override on each system Its part of the OS; Ill have to jump over the code Yes.I can do it.Youre sure?Lewis asked.You can turn it off?Shouldnt be hard, Johanssen said.Its an emergency feature, not a security program.It isnt protected against malicious code.Malicious code?Beck smiled.So youll be a hacker?Yeah.Johanssen smiled back.I guess I will.All right, Lewis said.Looks like we can do it.But I dont want peer pressure forcing anyone into it.Well wait for twenty four hours.During that time, anyone can change their mind.Just talk to me in private or send me an e mail.Ill call it off and never tell anyone who it was.Lewis stayed behind as the rest filed out.Watching them leave, she saw they were smiling.All four of them.For the first time since leaving Mars, they were back to their old selves.She knew right then no ones mind would change.They were going back to Mars.*  Eeveryone knew Brendan Hutch would be running missions soon.Hed risen through NASAs ranks as fast as one could in the large, inertia bound organization.He was known as a diligent worker, and his skill and leadership qualities were plain to all his subordinates.Brendan was in charge of Mission Control from one a. m.  to nine a. m.  every night.Continued excellent performance in this role would certainly net him a promotion.It had already been announced hed be backup flight controller for Ares 4, and he had a good shot at the top job for Ares 5.Flight, CAPCOM, a voice said through his headset.Go, CAPCOM, Brendan responded.Though they were in the same room, radio protocol was observed at all times.Unscheduled status update from Hermes.With Hermes ninety light seconds away, back and forth voice communication was impractical.Other than media relations, Hermes would communicate via text until they were much closer.Roger, Brendan said.Read it out.I I dont get it, Flight, came the confused reply.No real status, just a single sentence.Whats it say?Message reads: Houston, be advised: Rich Purnell is a steely eyed missile man.What?Brendan asked.Who the hell is Rich Purnell?Flight, Telemetry, another voice said.Go, Telemetry, Brendan said.Hermes is off course.CAPCOM, advise Hermes theyre drifting.Telemetry, get a correction vector ready  Negative, Flight, Telemetry interrupted.Its not drift.They adjusted course.Instrumentation uplink shows a deliberate 27.812  degree rotation.What the hell?Brendan stammered.CAPCOM, ask them what the hell.Roger, Flight message sent.Minimum reply time three minutes, four seconds.Telemetry, any chance this is instrumentation failure?Negative, Flight.Were tracking them with SatCon.Observed position is consistent with the course change.CAPCOM, read your logs and see what the previous shift did.See if a massive course change was ordered and somehow nobody told us.Roger, Flight.Guidance, Flight, Brendan said.Go, Flight, was the reply from the guidance controller.Work out how long they can stay on this course before its irreversible.At what point will they no longer be able to intercept Earth?Working on that now, Flight.And somebody find out who the hell Rich Purnell is!*  Mitch plopped down on the couch in Teddys office.He put his feet up on the coffee table and smiled at Teddy.You wanted to see me?Whyd you do it, Mitch?Teddy demanded.Do what?You know damn well what Im talking about.Oh, you mean the Hermes mutiny?Mitch said innocently.You know, thatd make a good movie title.The Hermes Mutiny.Got a nice ring to it.We know you did it, Teddy said sternly.We dont know how, but we know you sent them the maneuver.So you dont have any proof.Teddy glared.No.Not yet, but were working on it.Really?Mitch said.Is that really the best use of our time?I mean, we have a near Earth resupply to plan, not to mention figuring out how to get Watney to Schiaparelli.Weve got a lot on our plates.Youre damn right we have a lot on our plates!Teddy fumed.After your little stunt, were committed to this thing.Alleged stunt, Mitch said, raising a finger.I suppose Annie will tell the media we decided to try this risky maneuver?And shell leave out the mutiny part?Of course, Teddy said.Otherwise wed look like idiots.I guess everyones off the hook then!Mitch smiled.Cant fire people for enacting NASA policy.Even Lewis is fine.What mutiny?And maybe Watney gets to live.Happy endings all around!You may have killed the whole crew, Teddy countered.Ever think of that?Whoever gave them the maneuver, Mitch said, only passed along information.Lewis made the decision to act on it.If she let emotion cloud her judgment, shed be a shitty commander.And shes not a shitty commander.If I can ever prove it was you, Ill find a way to fire you for it, Teddy warned.Sure.Mitch shrugged.But if I wasnt willing to take risks to save lives, Id He thought for a moment.Well, I guess Id be you.Chapter 17      LOG ENTRY: SOL 192  Holy shit!Theyre coming back for me!I dont even know how to react.Im choked up!And Ive got a shitload of work to do before I catch that bus home.They cant orbit.If Im not in space when they pass by, all they can do is wave.I have to get to Ares 4s MAV.Even NASA accepts that.And when the nannies at NASA recommend a 3200 kilometer overland drive, you know youre in trouble.Schiaparelli, here I come!Well not right away.I still have to do the aforementioned shitload of work.My trip to Pathfinder was a quick jaunt compared to the epic journey thats coming up.I got away with a lot of shortcuts because I only had to survive eighteen sols.This time, things are different.I averaged 80 kilometers per sol on my way to Pathfinder.If I do that well toward Schiaparelli, the tripll take forty sols.Call it fifty to be safe.But theres more to it than just travel.Once I get there, Ill need to set up camp and do a bunch of MAV modifications.NASA estimates theyll take thirty sols, forty five to be safe.Between the trip and the MAV mods, thats ninety five sols.Call it one hundred because ninety five cries out to be approximated.So Ill need to survive away from the Hab for a hundred sols.What about the MAV?I hear you ask (in my fevered imagination).Wont it have some supplies?Air and water at the very least?Nope.Its got dick all.It does have air tanks, but theyre empty.An Ares mission needs lots of O2, N2, and water anyway.Why send more with the MAV?Easier to have the crew top off the MAV from the Hab.Fortunately for my crewmates, the mission plan had Martinez fill the MAV tanks on Sol 1.The flyby is on Sol 549, so Ill need to leave by 449.That gives me 257 sols to get my ass in gear.Seems like a long time, doesnt it?In that time, I need to modify the rover to carry the Big Three: the atmospheric regulator, the oxygenator, and the water reclaimer.All three need to be in the pressurized area, but the rover isnt big enough.All three need to be running at all times, but the rovers batteries cant handle that load for long.The rover will also need to carry all my food, water, and solar cells, my extra battery, my tools, some spare parts, and Pathfinder.As my sole means of communication with NASA, Pathfinder gets to ride on the roof, Granny Clampett style.I have a lot of problems to solve, but I have a lot of smart people to solve them.Pretty much the whole planet Earth.NASA is still working on the details, but the idea is to use both rovers.One to drive around, the other to act as my cargo trailer.Ill have to make structural changes to that trailer.And by structural changes I mean cut a big hole in the hull.Then I can move the Big Three in and use Hab canvas to loosely cover the hole.Itll balloon out when I pressurize the rover, but itll hold.How will I cut a big chunk out of a rovers hull?Ill let my lovely assistant Venkat Kapoor explain further:  [14:38] JPL: Im sure youre wondering how to cut a hole in the rover.Our experiments show a rock sample drill can get through the hull.Wear and tear on the bit is minimal (rocks are harder than carbon composite).You can cut holes in a line, then chisel out the remaining chunks between them.I hope you like drilling.The drill bit is 1 cm wide, the holes will be 0.5 cm apart, and the length of the total cut is 11.4 m.  Thats 760 holes.And each one takes 160 seconds to drill.Problem: The drills werent designed for construction projects.They were intended for quick rock samples.The batteries only last 240 seconds.You do have two drills, but youd still only get 3 holes done before needing to recharge.And recharging takes 41 minutes.Thats 173 hours of work, limited to 8 EVA hours per day.Thats 21 days of drilling, and thats just too long.All our other ideas hinge on this cut working.If it doesnt, we need time to come up with new ones.So we want you to wire a drill directly to Hab power.The drill expects 28.8 V and pulls 9 amps.The only lines that can handle that are the rover recharge lines.Theyre 36 V, 10 amp max.Since you have two, were comfortable with you modifying one.Well send you instructions on how to step down the voltage and put a new breaker in the line, but Im sure you already know how.Ill be playing with high voltage power tomorrow.Cant imagine anything going wrong with that!LOG ENTRY: SOL 193  I managed to not kill myself today, even though I was working with high voltage.Well, its not as exciting as all that.I disconnected the line first.As instructed, I turned a rover charging cable into a drill power source.Getting the voltage right was a simple matter of adding resistors, which my electronics kit has in abundance.I had to make my own nine amp breaker.I strung three three amp breakers in parallel.Theres no way for nine amps to get through that without tripping all three in rapid succession.Then I had to rewire a drill.Pretty much the same thing I did with Pathfinder.Take out the battery and replace it with a power line from the Hab.But this time it was a lot easier.Pathfinder was too big to fit through any of my airlocks, so I had to do all the rewiring outside.Ever done electronics while wearing a space suit?Pain in the ass.I even had to make a workbench out of MAV landing struts, remember?Anyway, the drill fit in the airlock easily.Its only a meter tall, and shaped like a jackhammer.We did our rock sampling standing up, like Apollo astronauts.Also, unlike my Pathfinder hatchet job, I had the full schematics of the drill.I removed the battery and attached a power line where it used to be.Then, taking the drill and its new cord outside, I connected it to the modified rover charger and fired it up.Worked like a charm!The drill whirled away with happy abandon.Somehow, I had managed to do everything right the first try.Deep down, I thought Id fry the drill for sure.It wasnt even midday yet.I figured why not get a jump on drilling?[10:07] Watney: Power line modifications complete.Hooked it up to a drill, and it works great.Plenty of daylight left.Send me a description of that hole you want me to cut.[10:25] JPL: Glad to hear it.Starting on the cut sounds great.Just to be clear, these are modifications to Rover 1, which weve been calling the trailer.Rover 2 (the one with your modifications for the trip to Pathfinder) should remain as is for now.Youll be taking a chunk out of the roof, just in front of the airlock in the rear of the vehicle.The hole needs to be at least 2.5 m long and the full 2 m width of the pressure vessel.Before any cuts, draw the shape on the trailer, and position the trailer where Pathfinders camera can see it.Well let you know if you got it right.[10:43] Watney: Roger.Take a pic at 11:30, if you havent heard from me by then.The rovers are made to interlock so one can tow the other.That way you can rescue your crewmates if all hell breaks loose.For that same reason, rovers can share air via hoses you connect between them.That little feature will let me share atmosphere with the trailer on my long drive.Id stolen the trailers battery long ago; it had no ability to move under its own power.So I hitched it up to my awesomely modified rover and towed it into place near Pathfinder.Venkat told me to draw the shape I plan to cut, but he neglected to mention how.Its not like I have a Sharpie that can work out on the surface.So I vandalized Martinezs bed.The cots are basically hammocks.Lightweight string woven loosely into something thats comfortable to sleep on.Every gram counts when making stuff to send to Mars.I unraveled Martinezs bed and took the string outside, then taped it to the trailer hull along the path I planned to cut.Yes, of course duct tape works in a near vacuum.Duct tape works anywhere.Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.I can see what NASA has in mind.The rear of the trailer has an airlock that were not going to mess with.The cut is just ahead of it and will leave plenty of space for the Big Three to stand.I have no idea how NASA plans to power the Big Three for twenty four and a half hours a day and still have energy left to drive.I bet they dont know, either.But theyre smart; theyll work something out.[11:49] JPL: What we can see of your planned cut looks good.Were assuming the other side is identical.Youre cleared to start drilling.[12:07] Watney: Thats what she said.[12:25] JPL: Seriously, Mark?Seriously?First, I depressurized the trailer.Call me crazy, but I didnt want the drill explosively launched at my face.Then I had to pick somewhere to start.I thought itd be easiest to start on the side.I was wrong.The roof would have been better.The side was a hassle because I had to hold the drill parallel to the ground.This isnt your dads Black & Decker were talking about.Its a meter long and only safe to hold by the handles.Getting it to bite was nasty.I pressed it against the hull and turned it on, but it wandered all over the place.So I got my trusty hammer and screwdriver.With a few taps, I made a small chip in the carbon composite.That gave the bit a place to seat, so I could keep drilling in one place.As NASA predicted, it took about two and a half minutes to get all the way through.I followed the same procedure for the second hole and it went much smoother.After the third hole, the drills overheat light came on.The poor drill wasnt designed to operate constantly for so long.Fortunately, it sensed the overheat and warned me.So I leaned it against the workbench for a few minutes, and it cooled down.One thing you can say about Mars: Its really cold.The thin atmosphere doesnt conduct heat very well, but it cools everything, eventually.I had already removed the drills cowling (the power cord needed a way in).A pleasant side effect is the drill cools even faster.Though Ill have to clean it thoroughly every few hours as dust accumulates.By 17:00, when the sun began to set, I had drilled seventy five holes.A good start, but theres still tons to do.Eventually (probably tomorrow) Ill have to start drilling holes that I cant reach from the ground.For that Ill need something to stand on.I cant use my workbench.Its got Pathfinder on it, and the last thing Im going to do is mess with that.But Ive got three more MAV landing struts.Im sure I can make a ramp or something.Anyway, thats all stuff for tomorrow.Tonight is about eating a full ration for dinner.Awww yeah.Thats right.Im either getting rescued on Sol 549 or Im dying.That means I have thirty five sols of extra food.I can indulge once in a while.LOG ENTRY: SOL 194  I average a hole every 3.5 minutes.That includes the occasional breather to let the drill cool off.I learned this by spending all damn day drilling.
