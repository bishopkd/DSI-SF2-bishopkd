A yellow atmosphere warning light began rotating in the cockpit, and a ditone Klaxon sounded.Were hit, Holden said, his voice calm.Dumping the atmosphere.Hope everyone has their hat on tight.As Holden shut down the air system, the sounds of the ship faded until Bobbie could hear only her own breathing and the faint hiss of the 1MC channel on her headset.Wow, Amos said over the comm.Three hits.Small projectiles, probably PDC rounds.Managed to go right through us without hitting anything that mattered.It went through my room, the scientist, Prax, said.Bet that woke you up, Amos said, his voice a grin.I soiled myself, Prax replied without a hint of humor.Quiet, Holden said, but there was no malice in it.Stay off the channel, please.Bobbie let the rational, thinking part of her mind listen to the back and forth.She had no use for that part of her brain right now.The part of her mind that had been trained to acquire targets and fire torpedoes at them worked without her interference.The lizard was driving now.She didnt know how many torpedoes shed fired when there was an enormous flash of light and the camera display blacked out for a second.When it came back, one of the UN destroyers was torn in two, the rapidly separating pieces of hull spinning away from each other, trailing a faint gas cloud and small bits of jetsam.Some of those things flying out of the shattered ship would be UN sailors.Bobbie ignored that.The lizard rejoiced.The destruction of the first UN ship tipped the scales, and within minutes the other five were heavily damaged or destroyed.A UN captain sent out a distress call and immediately signaled surrender.Bobbie looked at her display.Three UN ships destroyed.Three heavily damaged.The Martians had lost two destroyers, and one of their cruisers was badly damaged.The Rocinante had three bullet wounds that had let all her air out, but no other damage.Theyd won.Holy shit, Alex said.Captain, we have got to get one of these.It took Bobbie a minute to realize he was talking about her.You have the gratitude of the UN government, Avasarala was saying to the Martian commander.Or at least the part of the UN government I run.Were going to Io to blow up some more ships and maybe stop the apocalypse.Want to come with?Bobbie opened a private channel to Avasarala.Were all traitors now.Ha!the old lady said.Only if we lose.Forty Four: Holden  From the outside, the damage to the Rocinante was barely noticeable.The three point defense cannon rounds fired by one of the UN destroyers had hit her just forward of the sick bay and, after a short diagonal trip through the ship, exited through the machine shop, two decks below.Along the way, one of them had passed through three cabins in the crew deck.Holden had expected the little botanist to be a wreck, especially after his crack about soiling himself.But when Holden had checked on him after the battle, hed been surprised by the nonchalant shrug the scientist had given.It was very startling, was all hed said.It would be easy to write it off as shell shock.The kidnapping of his daughter, followed by months of living on Ganymede as the social structure collapsed.Easy to see Praxs calm as the precursor to a complete mental and emotional breakdown.God knew the man had lost control of himself half a dozen times, and most of them inconvenient.But Holden suspected there was a lot more to Prax than that.There was a relentless forward motion to the man.The universe might knock him down over and over again, but unless he was dead, hed just keep getting up and shuffling ahead toward his goal.Holden thought he had probably been a very good scientist.Thrilled by small victories, undeterred by setbacks.Plodding along until he got to where he needed to be.Even now, just hours after nearly being cut in two by a highspeed projectile, Prax was belowdecks with Naomi and Avasarala, patching holes inside the ship.He hadnt even been asked.Hed just climbed out of his bunk and pitched in.Holden stood above one of the bullet entry points on the ships outer hull.The small projectile had left a perfectly round hole and almost no dimpling.It had passed through five centimeters of high tensile alloy armor so quickly it hadnt even dented it.Found it, Holden said.No light coming out, so it looks like theyve already patched it on the inside.Coming, Amos said, then clumped across the hull on magnetic boots, a portable welding torch in his hand.Bobbie followed in her fancy powered armor, carrying big sheets of patch material.While Bobbie and Amos worked on sealing up the outer hull breach, Holden wandered off to find the next hole.Around him, the three remaining Martian warships drifted along with the Rocinante like an honor guard.With their drives off, they were visible only as small black spots that moved across the star field.Even with the Roci telling his armor where to look, and with the HUD pointing the ships out, they were almost impossible to see.Holden tracked the Martian cruiser on his HUD until it passed across the bright splash of the Milky Ways ecliptic.For a moment, the entire ship was a black silhouette framed in the ancient white of a few billion stars.A faint cone of translucent white sprayed out from one side of the ship, and it drifted back into the star speckled black.Holden felt a desire to have Naomi standing next to him, looking up at the same sights, that bordered on a physical ache.I forget how beautiful it is out here, he said to her over their private channel instead.You daydreaming and letting someone else do all the work?she replied.Yeah.More of these stars have planets around them than dont.Billions of worlds.Five hundred million planets in the habitable zone was the last estimate.Think our great grandkids will get to see any of them?Our grandkids?When this is over.Also, Naomi said, at least one of those planets has the protomolecule masters on it.Maybe we should avoid that one.Honestly?Thats one Id like to see.Who made this thing?Whats it all for?Id love to be able to ask.And at the very least, they share the human drive to find every habitable corner and move in.We might have more in common than we think.They also kill whoever lived there first.Holden snorted.Weve been doing that since the invention of the spear.Theyre just scary good at it.You found that next hole yet?Amos said over the main channel, his voice an unwelcome intrusion.Holden pulled his gaze away from the sky and back to the metal beneath his feet.Using the damage map the Roci was feeding to his HUD, it took only a moment to find the next entry wound.Yeah, yeah, right here, he said, and Amos and Bobbie began moving his direction.Cap, Alex said, chiming in from the cockpit.The captain of that MCRN cruiser is lookin to talk to you.Patch him through to my suit.Roger, Alex said, and then the static on the radio shifted in tone.Captain Holden?I read you.Go ahead.This is Captain Richard Tseng of the MCRN Cydonia.Sorry we werent able to speak sooner.Ive been dealing with damage control and arranging for rescue and repair ships.I understand, Captain, Holden said, trying to spot the Cydonia again but failing.Im out on my hull patching a few holes myself.I saw you guys drive by a minute ago.My XO says youd asked to speak to me.Yes, and thank her on my behalf for all the help so far, Holden said.Listen, we burned through an awful lot of our stores in that skirmish.We fired fourteen torpedoes and nearly half of our point defense ammunition.Since this used to be a Martian ship, I thought maybe youd have reloads that would fit our racks.Sure, Captain Tseng said without a moments hesitation.Ill have the destroyer Sally Ride pull alongside for munitions transfer.Uh, Holden said, shocked by the instant agreement.Hed been prepared to negotiate.Thanks.Ill pass along my intel officers breakdown of the fight.Youll find it interesting viewing.But the short version is that first kill, the one that broke open the UN defense screen and ended the fight?That was yours.Guess they shouldnt have turned their backs on you.You guys can take credit for it, Holden said with a laugh.I had a Martian Marine gunnery sergeant doing the shooting.There was a pause; then Tseng said, When this is over, Id like to buy you a drink and talk about how a dishonorably discharged UN naval officer winds up flying a stolen MCRN torpedo bomber crewed by Martian military personnel and a senior UN politician.Its a damn good story, Holden replied.Say, speaking of Martians, Id like to get one of mine a present.Do you carry a Marine detachment on the Cydonia?Yes, why?Got any Force Recon Marines in that group?Yes.Again, why?Theres some equipment well need that youve probably got in storage.He told Captain Tseng what he was looking for, and Tseng said, Ill have the Ride give you one when we do the transfer.The MCRN Sally Ride looked like shed come through the fight without a scratch.When she pulled up next to the Rocinante, her dark flank looked as smooth and unmarred as a pool of black water.After Alex and the Rides pilot had perfectly matched course, a large hatch in her side opened up, dim red emergency lighting spilling out.Two magnetic grapples were fired across, connecting the ships with ten meters of cable.This is Lieutenant Graves, a girlish voice said.Prepared to begin cargo transfer on your order.Lieutenant Graves sounded like she should still be in high school, but Holden said, Go ahead.Were ready on this end.Switching channels to Naomi, he said, Pop the hatches, new fish coming aboard.A few meters from where he was standing, a large hatch that was normally flush with the hull opened up into a meter wide and eight meter long gap in the skin of the ship.A complicated looking system of rails and gears ran down the sides of the opening.At the bottom sat three of the Rocinantes remaining ship to ship torpedoes.Seven in here, Holden said, pointing at the open torpedo rack.And seven on the other side.Roger, said Graves.The long, narrow white shape of a plasma torpedo appeared in the Rides open hatch, with sailors wearing EVA packs flanking it.With gentle puffs of compressed nitrogen, they flew the torpedo down along the two guidelines to the Roci; then, with the help of Bobbies suit augmented strength, they maneuvered it into position at the top of the rack.First one in position, Bobbie said.Got it, Naomi replied, and a second later the motorized rails came to life and grabbed the torpedo, pulling it down into the magazine.Holden glanced at the elapsed time on his HUD.Getting all fourteen torpedoes transferred and loaded would take hours.Amos, he said.Where are you?Just finishing that last patch down by the machine shop, the mechanic replied.You need something?When youre done with that, grab a couple EVA packs.You and I will go get the other supplies.Should be three crates of PDC rounds and some sundries.Im done now.Naomi, pop the cargo door for me, wouldja?Holden watched Bobbie and the Rides sailors work, and they had two more torpedoes loaded by the time Amos arrived with two EVA packs.Lieutenant Graves, two crew from the Rocinante requesting permission to board and pick up the rest of the supplies.Granted, Rocinante.The PDC rounds came in crates of twenty thousand and at full gravity would have weighed more than five hundred kilos.In the microgravity of the coasting ships, two people with EVA packs could move one if they were willing to take their time and recharge their compressed nitrogen after every trip.Without a salvage mech or a small work shuttle available, there wasnt any other choice.Each crate had to be pushed slowly toward the aft of the Rocinante through a twenty second long burn from Amos EVA pack.When it got to the aft of the ship next to the cargo bay door, Holden would do an equally long thrust from his pack to bring the crate to a stop.Then the two of them would maneuver it inside and lock it to a bulkhead.The process was long, and at least for Holden, each trip had one heart racing moment when he was firing the brakes to stop the crate.Every time, he had a brief, panicky vision of his EVA pack failing and him and the crate of ammo drifting off into space while Amos watched.It was ridiculous, of course.Amos could easily grab a fresh EVA pack and come get him, or the ship could drop back, or the Ride could send a rescue shuttle, or any other of a huge number of ways hed be quickly saved.But humans hadnt been living and working in space nearly long enough for the primitive part of the brain not to say, Ill fall.Ill fall forever.The people from the Ride finished bringing over torpedoes about the time Holden and Amos had locked the last crate of PDC ammo into the cargo bay.Naomi, Holden called on the open channel.We all green?Everything looks good from here.All of the new torpedoes are talking to the Roci and reporting operational.Outstanding.Amos and I are coming in through the cargo bay airlock.Go ahead and seal the bay up.Alex, as soon as Naomi gives the all clear, let the Cydonia know we can do a fast burn to Io at the captains earliest pleasure.While the crew prepped the ship for the trip to Io, Holden and Amos stripped off their gear and stowed it in the machine shop.Six gray disks, three on each bulkhead across the compartment from each other, showed where the rounds had ripped through this part of the ship.Whats in that other box the Martians gave you?Amos asked, pulling off one oversized magnetic boot.A present for Bobbie, Holden said.Id like to keep it quiet until I give it to her, okay?Sure, no problem, Capn.If it turns out to be a dozen long stemmed roses, I dont want to be there when Naomi finds out.Plus, you know, Alex  No, its a lot more practical than roses  Holden started, then rewound the conversation in his head.Alex?What about Alex?Amos shrugged with his hands, like a Belter.I think he might have a wee bit of a thing for our ample marine.Youre kidding.Holden couldnt picture it.It wasnt as though Bobbie were unattractive.Far from it.But she was also very big, and quite intimidating.And Alex was such a quiet and mild guy.Sure, they were both Martians, and no matter how cosmopolitan a person got, there was something comforting in reminders of home.Maybe just being the only two Martians on the ship was enough.But Alex was pushing fifty, balding without complaint, and wore his love handles with the quiet resignation of a middle aged man.Sergeant Draper couldnt be more than thirty and looked like a comic book illustration, complete with muscles on her muscles.Unable to stop himself, his mind began trying to figure out how the two of them would fit together.It didnt work.Wow, was all he could say.Is it mutual?No idea, Amos replied with another shrug.The sergeant aint easy to read.But I dont think shed do him any deliberate harm, if thats what youre asking.Not that, you know, we could stop her.Scares you too, does she?Look, Amos said with a grin.When it comes to scrapes, Im what you might call a talented amateur.But Ive gotten a good look at that woman in and out of that fancy mechanical shell she wears.Shes a pro.Were not playing the same sport.Gravity began to return in the Rocinante.Alex was bringing up the drive, which meant they were beginning their run to Io.Holden stood up and took a moment to let his joints adjust to the sensation of weight again.He clapped Amos on the back and said, Well, youve got a full load of torpedoes and bullets, three Martian warships trailing you, one angry old lady in tea withdrawal, and a Martian Marine who could probably kill you with your own teeth.What do you do?You tell me, Captain.You find someone else for them to fight.Forty Five: Avasarala  As I see it, sir, Avasarala said, the die is already cast.We effectively have two courses of policy already in play.The question now is how we move forward.So far Ive been able to keep the information from getting out, but once it does, it will be devastating.And since it is all but certain that the artifact is able to communicate, the chances of an effective military usage of these protomolecule human hybrids is essentially nil.If we use this weapon, we will be creating a second Venus, committing genocide, and removing any moral argument against using weapons like accelerated asteroids against the Earth itself.I hope you will excuse the language, sir, but this was a cock up from the start.The damage done to human security is literally unimaginable.It seems clear at this point that the protomolecule project under way on Venus is aware of events in the Jovian system.Its plausible that the samples out here have the information gained from the destruction of the Arboghast.To say that makes our position problematic is to radically understate the case.If it had gone through the appropriate channels, we would not be in this position.As it stands, I have done all that is presently within my capabilities, given my situation.The coalition I have built between Mars, elements of the Belt, and the legitimate government of Earth are ready to take action.But the United Nations must distance itself from this plan and move immediately to isolate and defang the faction within the government that has been doing this weasel shit.Again, excuse the language.I have sent copies of the data included here to Admirals Souther and Leniki as well as to my team on the Venus problem.They are, of course, at your disposal to answer any questions if I am not available.Im very sorry to put you in the position, sir, but you are going to have to choose sides in this.And quickly.Events out here have developed a momentum of their own.If youre going to be on the right side of history on this, you must move now.If theres any history to be on the right side of, she thought.She tried to come up with something else that she could say, some other argument that would penetrate the layers of old growth wood that surrounded the secretary generals brain.There werent any, and repeating herself in simple storybook rhyme would probably come off as condescending.She stopped the recording, cut off the last few seconds of her looking into the camera in despair, and sent it off with every high priority flag there was and diplomatic encryption.So this was what it came to.All of human civilization, everything it had managed, from the first cave painting to crawling up the gravity well and pressing out into the antechamber of the stars, came down to whether a man whose greatest claim to fame was that hed been thrown in prison for writing bad poetry had the balls to back down Errinwright.The ship corrected under her, shifting like an elevator suddenly slipping its tracks.She tried to sit up, but the gimbaled couch moved.God, but she hated space travel.Is it going to work?The botanist stood in her doorway.He was stick thin, with a slightly larger head than looked right.He wasnt built as awkwardly as a Belter, but he couldnt be mistaken for someone whod grown to maturity living at a full gravity.Standing in her doorway, trying to find something to do with his hands, he looked awkward and lost and slightly otherworldly.I dont know, she said.If I were there, it would happen the way I want it to happen.I could go squeeze a few testicles until they saw it my way.From here?Maybe.Maybe not.You can talk to anyone from here, though, cant you?It isnt the same.He nodded, his attention shifting inward.Despite the differences in skin color and build, the man suddenly reminded her of Michael Jon.He had the same sense of being a half step back from everything.Only, Michael Jons detachment verged on autism, and Praxidike Meng was a little more visibly interested in the people around him.They got to Nicola, he said.They made her say those things about me.About Mei.Of course they did.Thats what they do.And if they wanted to, theyd have papers and police reports to back it all up, backdated and put in the databases of everywhere you ever lived.I hate it that people think I did that.Avasarala nodded, then shrugged.Reputation never has very much to do with reality, she said.I could name half a dozen paragons of virtue that are horrible, small souled, evil people.And some of the best men I know, youd walk out of the room if you heard their names.No one on the screen is who they are when you breathe their air.Holden, Prax said.Well.Hes the exception, she said.The botanist looked down and then up again.His expression was almost apologetic.Meis probably dead, he said.You dont believe that.Its been a long time.Even if they had her medicine, theyve probably turned her into one of these things.You still dont believe that, she said.The botanist leaned forward, frowning like shed given him a problem he couldnt immediately solve.Tell me its all right to bomb Io.I can have thirty nuclear warheads fired now.Turn off the engines, let them fly ballistic.They wont all get through, but some will.Say the word now, and I can have Io reduced to slag before we even get there.Youre right, Prax said.And then, a moment later: Why arent you doing that?Do you want the real reason, or my justification?Both?I justify it this way, she said.I dont know what is in that lab.I cant assume that the monsters are only there, and if I destroy the place, I might be slagging the records that will let me find the missing ones.I dont know everyone involved in this, and I dont have proof against some of the ones I do know.It may be down there.Ill go, Ill find out, and then I will reduce the lab to radioactive glass afterward.Those are good reasons.Theyre good justifications.I find them very convincing.But the reason is that Mei might still be alive.I dont kill children, she said.Not even when its the right thing to do.You would be surprised how often its hurt my political career.People used to think I was weak until I found the trick.The trick.If you can make them blush, they think youre a hard ass, she said.My husband calls it the mask.Oh, Prax said.Thank you.Waiting was worse than the fear of battle.Her body wanted to move, to get away from her chair and walk through the familiar halls.The back of her mind shouted for action, movement, confrontation.She paced the ship top to bottom and back again.Her mind went through trivia about all the people she met in the halls, the small detritus from the intelligence reports shed read.The mechanic, Amos Burton.Implicated in several murders, indicted, never tried.Took an elective vasectomy the day he was legally old enough to do so.Naomi Nagata, the engineer.Two masters degrees.Offered full ride scholarship for a PhD on Ceres Station and turned it down.Alex Kamal, pilot.Seven drunk and disorderlies when he was in his early twenties.Had a son on Mars he still didnt know about.James Holden, the man without secrets.The holy fool whod dragged the solar system into war and seemed utterly blind to the damage he caused.An idealist.The most dangerous kind of man there was.And a good man too.She wondered whether any of it mattered.The only real player near enough to talk to without lag turning the conversation utterly epistolary was Souther, and as he was still putatively on the same side as Nguyen and preparing to face battle with the ships protecting her, the opportunities were few and far between.Have you heard anything?he asked from her terminal.No, she said.I dont know whats taking the fucking bobble head so long.Youre asking him to turn his back on the man hes trusted the most.And how fucking long does that take?When I did it, it was over in maybe five minutes.Soren, I said.Youre a douche bag.Get out of my sight.It isnt harder than that.And if he doesnt come through?Souther asked.She sighed.Then I call you back and try talking you into going rogue.Ah, Souther said with a half smile.And how do you see that going?I dont like my chances, but you never know.I can be damned persuasive.An alert popped up.A new message.From Arjun.I have to go, she said.Keep an ear to the ground or whatever the hell you do out here where the ground doesnt mean anything.Be safe, Chrisjen, Souther said, and vanished into the green background of a dead connection.Around her, the galley was empty.Still, someone might come in.She lifted the hem of her sari and walked to her little room, sliding her door closed before she gave her terminal permission to open the file.Arjun was at his desk, his formal clothes on but undone at the neck and sleeves.He looked like a man just returned from a bad party.The sunlight streamed in behind him.Afternoon, then.It had been afternoon when hed sent it.And it might still be.She touched the screen, her fingertips tracing the line of his shoulder.So I understand from your message that you may not come home, he said.Im sorry, she said to the screen.As you imagine, I find the thought distressing, he said, and then a smile split his face, dancing in eyes she now saw were red with tears.But what can I do about it?I teach poetry to graduate students.I have no power in this world.That has always been you.And so I want to offer you this.Dont think about me.Dont take your mind from what youre doing on my account.And if you dont  Arjun took a deep breath.If life transcends death, then I will seek for you there.If not, then there too.He looked down and then up again.I love you, Kiki.And I will always love you, from whatever distance.The message ended.Avasarala closed her eyes.Around her, the ship was as close and confining as a coffin.The small noises of it pressed in against her until she wanted to scream.Until she wanted to sleep.She let herself weep for a moment.There was nothing else to be done.She had taken her best shot, and there was nothing to be done but meditate and worry.Half an hour later, her terminal chimed again, waking her from troubled dreams.Errinwright.Anxiety knotted her throat.She lifted a finger to begin the playback, and then paused.She didnt want to.She didnt want to go back into that world, wear her heavy mask.She wanted to watch Arjun again.Listen to his voice.Only, of course, Arjun had known what she would want.It was why hed said the things he had.She started the message.Errinwright looked angry.More than that, he looked tired.His pleasant demeanor was gone, and he was a man made entirely of salt water and threat.Chrisjen, he said.I know you wont understand this, but I have been doing everything in my power to keep you and yours safe.You dont understand what youve waded into, and you are fucking things up.I wish you had had the moral courage to come to me with this before you ran off like a horny sixteen year old with James Holden.Honestly, if there was a better way to destroy any professional credibility you once had, I cant think what it would have been.I put you on the Guanshiyin to take you off the board because I knew that things were about to go hot.Well, they are, only youre in the middle of them and you dont understand the situation.Millions of people stand in real danger of dying badly because of your egotism.Youre one of them.Arjuns another.And your daughter.All of them are in threat now because of you.In the image, Errinwright clasped his hands together, pressing his knuckles against his lower lip, the platonic ideal of a scolding father.If you come back now, I might might be able to save you.Not your career.Thats gone.Forget it.Everyone down here sees that youre working with the OPA and Mars.Everyone thinks youve betrayed us, and I cant undo that.Your life and your family.Thats all I can salvage.But you have to get away from this circus youve started, and you have to do it now.Times short, Chrisjen.Everything important to you hangs in the balance, and I cannot help you if you dont help yourself.Not with this.Its last chance time.Ignore me now, and the next time we talk, someone will have died.The message ended.She started it again, and then a third time.Her grin felt feral.She found Bobbie in the ops deck with the pilot, Alex.They stopped talking as she came in, a question in Bobbies expression.Avasarala held up a finger and switched the video feed to display on the ship monitors.Errinwright came to life.On the big screens, she could see his pores and the individual hairs in his eyebrows.As he spoke, Avasarala saw Alex and Bobbie grow sober, leaning in toward the screen as if they were all at a poker table and coming to the end of a high stakes hand.All right, Bobbie said.What do we do?We break out the fucking champagne, Avasarala said.What did he just tell us?There is nothing in that message.Nothing.He is walking around his words like theyve got poisoned spikes on them.And whats he got?Threats.No one makes threats.Wait, Alex said.That was a good sign?That was excellent, Avasarala said, and then something else, something small, fell into place in the back of her mind and she started laughing and cursing at the same time.What?What is it?If life transcends death, then I will seek for you there.If not, then there too, she said.Its a fucking haiku.That man has a one track mind and one train on it.Poetry.Save me from poetry.They didnt understand, but they didnt need to.The real message came five hours later.It came on a public newsfeed, and it was delivered by Secretary General Esteban Sorrento Gillis.The old man was brilliant at looking somber and energetic at the same time.If he hadnt been the executive of the largest governing body in the history of the human race, hed have made a killing promoting health drinks.The whole crew had gathered by now Amos, Naomi, Holden, Alex.Even Prax.They were sandwiched into the ops deck, their combined breaths just slightly overloading the recyclers and giving the deck a feeling of barn heat.All eyes were on the screen as the secretary general took the podium.I have come here tonight to announce the immediate formation of an investigative committee.Accusations have been made that some individuals within the governing body of the United Nations and its military forces have taken unauthorized and possibly illegal steps in dealing with certain private contractors.If these accusations are true, they must be addressed in the most expedient possible manner.And if unfounded, they must be dispelled and those responsible for spreading these lies called to account.I need not remind you all of the years I spent as a political prisoner.Oh fuck me, Avasarala said, clapping her hands in glee.Hes using the outsider speech.That mans asshole must be tight enough right now to bend space.I have dedicated my terms as secretary general to rooting out corruption, and as long as I have this gavel, I shall continue to do so.Our world and the solar system we all share must be assured that the United Nations honors the ethical, moral, and spiritual values that hold us all together as a species.On the feed, Esteban Sorrento Gillis nodded, turned, and strode away in a clamor of unacknowledged questions, and the commentators flowed into the space, talking over each other in all the political opinions of the spectrum.Okay, Holden said.So did he actually say anything?He said Errinwright is finished, Avasarala said.If he had any influence left at all, that announcement would never have been made.Goddamn, I wish I was there.Errinwright was off the board.All that left was Nguyen, Mao, Strickland or whoever he was, their half controlled protomolecule warriors, and the building threat of Venus.She let a long breath rattle through her throat and the spaces behind her nose.Ladies and gentlemen, she said, I have just solved our smallest problem.Forty Six: Bobbie  One of Bobbies most vivid memories was of the day she got her orders to report to the 2nd Expeditionary Force Spec War training facility.Force Recon.The top of the heap for a Martian ground pounder.In boot camp, theyd trained with a Force Recon sergeant.Hed been wearing a suit of gleaming red power armor, and theyd watched him demonstrate its use in a variety of tactical situations.At the end, hed told them that the top four boots from her class would be transferred to the Spec War facility on the slopes of Hecates Tholus and trained to wear the armor and join the baddest fighting unit in the solar system.She decided that meant her.Determined to win one of those four coveted slots, shed thrown herself into her boot camp training with everything she had.It turned out that was quite a lot.Not only did she make it into the top four, she was number one by an embarrassing margin.And then the letter came, ordering her to report to Hecate Base for recon training, and it was all worth it.She called her father and just screamed for two minutes.When he finally got her to calm down and tell him what she was calling about, he screamed back for even longer.Youre one of the best now, baby, hed said at the end, and the warmth those words put in her heart had never really faded.Even now, sitting on the gray metal deck in the dirty machine shop on a stolen Martian warship.Even with all her mates torn into pieces and scattered across the frozen surface of Ganymede.Even with her military status in limbo and her loyalty to her nation justifiably in question.Even with all that, Youre one of the best now, baby made her smile.She felt an ache to call her father and tell him what had happened.Theyd always been close, and when neither of her brothers had followed in his footsteps by choosing a military career, she had.It had just strengthened the connection.She knew hed understand what it was costing her to turn her back on everything she held sacred to avenge her team.And she had a powerful premonition shed never see him again.Even if they made it through to Jupiter with half the UN fleet hunting them, and even if when they got there, Admiral Nguyen and the dozen or more ships he controlled didnt immediately blow them out of the sky, and even if they managed to stop whatever was happening in orbit around Io with the Rocinante intact, Holden was still planning to land and save Praxs daughter.The monsters would be there.She knew it as surely as shed ever known anything in her life.Each night she dreamed of facing it again.The thing flexing its long fingers and staring at her with its too large glowing blue eyes, ready to finish what it had started all those months earlier on Ganymede.In her dream, she raised a gun that grew out of her hand, and started shooting it as it ran toward her, black spiderwebs spilling from holes that closed like water.She always woke before it reached her, but she knew how the dream would end: with her shattered body left cooling on the ice.She also knew that when Holden led his team down to the laboratories on Io where the monsters were made, shed go along with him.The scene from her dream would play out in real life.She knew it like she knew her fathers love.She welcomed it.On the floor around her lay the pieces of her armor.With weeks of travel on the way to Io, she had time to completely strip and refit it.The Rocinantes machine shop was well stocked, and the tools were of Martian make.It was the perfect location.The suit had seen a lot of use without much maintenance, but if she was being honest with herself, the distraction was the payoff.A suit of Martian reconnaissance armor was an incredibly complex machine, finely tuned to its wearer.Stripping and reassembling it wasnt a trivial task.It required full concentration.Every moment she spent working on it was another moment when she didnt think about the monster waiting to kill her on Io.Sadly, that distraction was over now.Shed finished with the maintenance, even finding the micro fracture in a tiny valve that was causing the slow but persistent leak of fluid in the suits knee actuator.It was time to just put it all back together.It had the feeling of ritual.A final cleansing before going out to meet death on the battlefield.Ive watched too many Kurosawa movies, she thought, but couldnt quite abandon the idea.The imagery was a lovely way of turning angst and suicidal ideation into honor and noble sacrifice.She picked up the torso assembly and carefully wiped it off with a damp cloth, removing the last bits of dust and machine oil that clung to the outside.The smell of metal and lubricant filled the air.And while she bolted armor plating back onto the frame, the red enameled surface covered with a thousand dings and scratches, she stopped fighting the urge to ritualize the task and just let it happen.She was very likely assembling her death shroud.Depending on how the final battle went, this ceramic and rubber and alloy might house her corpse for the rest of eternity.She flipped the torso assembly over and began working on the back.A long gouge in the enamel showed the violence of her passage across Ganymedes ice when the monster had self destructed right in front of her.She picked up a wrench, then put it back down, tapping on the deck with her knuckle.Why then?Why had the monster blown itself up at that moment?She remembered the way it had started to shift, new limbs bursting from its body as it watched her.If Prax was right, that was the moment the constraint systems that Maos scientists had installed failed.And theyd set the bomb up to detonate if the creature was getting out of their control.But that just pushed the question one level back.Why had their control over the creatures physiology failed at that precise moment?Prax said that regenerative processes were a good place for constraint systems to fail.And her platoon had riddled the creature with gunfire as it had charged their lines.It hadnt seemed to hurt it at the time, but each wound represented a sudden burst of activity inside the creatures cells, or whatever it had in place of cells, as the monster healed.Each was a chance for the new growth to slip the leash.Maybe that was the answer.Dont try to kill the monster.Just damage it enough that the program starts to break down and the self destruct kicks in.She wouldnt even have to survive, just last long enough to harm the monster beyond its ability to safely repair itself.All she needed was enough time to really hurt it.She put down the armor plate she was working on and picked up the helmet.The suits memory still had the gun camera footage of the fight on it.She hadnt watched it again after Avasaralas presentation to the crew of the Roci.She hadnt been able to.She pushed herself to her feet and hit the comm panel on the wall.Hey, Naomi?You in ops?Yep, Naomi said after a few seconds.You need something, Sergeant?Do you think you can tell the Roci to talk to my helmet?Ive got the radio on, but it wont talk to civilian stuff.This is one of our boats, so I figure the Roci has the keys and codes.There was a long pause, so Bobbie put the helmet on a worktable next to the closest wall monitor and waited.Im seeing a radio node that the Roci is calling MCR MR Goliath III 24397A15.Thats me, Bobbie said.Can you send control of that node down to the panel in the machine shop?Done, Naomi said after a second.Thanks, Bobbie said, and killed the comm.It took her a moment to re familiarize herself with the Martian military video software, and to convince the system to use out of date data unpacking algorithms.After a few false starts, the raw gun camera footage from her fight on Ganymede was playing on the screen.She set it to endless loop and sat back down on the deck with her suit.She finished bolting the back armor on and began attaching the torsos power supply and main hydraulic system during the first play through.She tried not to feel anything about the images on screen, nor to attach any significance to them or think of them as a puzzle to be solved.She just concentrated on her work on the suit with her mind and let her subconscious chew on the data from the screen.The distraction caused her to redo things occasionally as she worked, but that was fine.She wasnt on a deadline.She finished attaching the power supply and main motors.Green lights lit up on the hand terminal she had plugged into the suits brain.On the wall screen by her helmet, a UN soldier was hurled across the surface of Ganymede at her.A confusion of images as she dodged away.When the image steadied, both the UN Marine and her friend Tev Hillman were gone.Bobbie picked up an arm assembly and began reattaching it to the torso.The monster had picked up a soldier in a suit of armor comparable to her own and then thrown him with enough force to kill instantly.There was no defense against that kind of strength except not to get hit.She concentrated on putting the arm back together.When she looked up at the screen again, the feed had restarted.The monster was running across the ice, chasing the UN soldiers.It killed one of them.The Bobbie on the video began firing, followed by her entire platoon opening up.The creature was fast.But when the UN soldiers suddenly turned to open a firing lane for the Martians, the creature didnt react quickly.So maybe fast in a straight line, but not a lot of lateral speed.That might be useful.The video caught up again to the UN soldier being thrown into Private Hillman.The creature reacted to gunfire, to injuries, even though they didnt slow it down.She thought back to the video shed seen of Holden and Amos engaging the creature in the Rocinantes cargo hold.It had largely ignored them until Amos started shooting it, and then it had erupted into violence.But the first creature had attacked the UN troop station.So at least to some degree, they could be directed.Given orders.Once they no longer had orders, they seemed to lapse into a default state of trying to get increased energy and break the constraints.While in that state, they ignored pretty much everything but food and violence.The next time she ran into one, unless it had specifically been ordered to attack her, she could probably pick her own battleground, draw it to her where she wanted to be.That was useful too.She finished attaching the arm assembly and tested it.Greens across the board.Even if she wasnt sure whom she was working for, at least she hadnt forgotten how to do her job.On the screen, the monster ran up the side of the big mech Yojimbo and tore the pilots hatch off.Said, the pilot, was hurled away.Again with the ripping and throwing.It made sense.With a combination like enormous strength and virtual immunity to ballistic damage as your tool set, running straight at your opponent, then ripping them in two was a pretty winning strategy.Throwing heavy objects at lethal speeds went hand in hand with the strength.And kinetic energy was a bitch.Armor might deflect bullets or lasers, and it might help cushion impacts, but no one had ever made armor that could shrug off all the kinetic energy imparted by a large mass moving at high speed.At least not in something a human could wear.If you were strong enough, a garbage Dumpster was better than a gun.So when the monster attacked, it ran straight at its enemy, hoping to get a grip on them, which pretty much ended the fight.If it couldnt do that, it tried to hurl heavy objects at the opponent.The one in the cargo bay had nearly killed Jim Holden by throwing a massive crate.Unfortunately, her armor had a lot of the same restrictions it had.While it made her very fast when she wanted to be, it was not particularly good at lateral movement.Most things built for speed werent.Cheetahs and horses didnt do a lot of sideways running.She was strong in her suit, but not nearly as strong as it was.She did have an advantage with firearms in that she could run away from the creature while continuing to attack from range.The creature couldnt throw a massive object at her without stopping and anchoring itself.It might be ungodly strong, but it still only weighed what it weighed, and Newton had a few things to say about a light object throwing a heavy one.By the time shed finished assembling her suit, shed watched the video over a hundred times, and the tactics of the fight were starting to take shape in her head.In hand to hand combat training, shed been able to overpower most of her opponents.But the small and quick fighters, the ones who knew how to stick and move, gave her trouble.That was who shed be in this fight.Shed have to hit and run, never stopping for a moment.And even then shed need a lot of luck, because she was fighting way out of her weight class, and one shot from the monster was a guaranteed knockout.Her other advantage was that she didnt really have to win.She just had to do enough damage to make the monster kill itself.By the time shed climbed into her newly refurbished suit and let it close around her for a final test, she was pretty sure she could do that.Bobbie thought her newfound peace about the battle to come would finally let her sleep, but after three hours of tossing and turning in her rack, she gave up.Something still itched at the back of her head.She was trying to find her Bushido, and there were still too many things she couldnt let go of.Something wasnt giving her permission yet.So she pulled on a large fuzzy bathrobe shed stolen from the Guanshiyin, and rode the ladder lift up toward the ops deck.It was third watch, so the ship was deserted.Holden and Naomi had a cabin together, and she found herself envying that human contact right now.Something certain to cling to amid all the other uncertainty.Avasarala was in her borrowed cabin, probably sending messages to people back on Earth.Alex would be asleep in his room, and for a brief moment she considered waking him.She liked the gregarious pilot.He was genuine in a way she hadnt seen much of since leaving active duty.But she also knew that waking a man up at three a. m.  while in her bathrobe sent signals she didnt intend.Rather than try to explain that she just needed to talk to someone, she passed the crew deck by and kept going.Amos was sitting at a station in ops with his back to her, taking the late watch.To avoid startling him, she cleared her throat.He didnt move or react, so she walked to the comm station.Looking back at him, she saw that his eyes were closed and his breathing was very deep and regular.Sleeping on a duty watch would get you captains mast, at the least, on an MCRN ship.It seemed Holden had let discipline lapse a bit since his Navy days.Bobbie opened up the comms and found the closest relay for tightbeam traffic.First she called her father.Hi, Pop.Not sure you should try and answer this.The situation here is volatile and evolving rapidly.But you may hear a lot of crazy shit over the next few days.Some of it might be about me.Just know that I love you guys, and I love Mars.Everything I did was to try and protect you and my home.I might have lost my way a little bit, because things got complicated and hard to figure out.But I think I see a clear path now, and Im going to take it.I love you and Mom.Tell the boys they suck.Before she turned off the recording, she reached out and touched the screen.Bye, Dad.She pressed send, but something still felt incomplete.Outside her family, anyone whod tried to help her in the last three months was sitting on the same ship she was, so it didnt make sense.Except, of course, that it did.Because not everyone was on this ship.Bobbie punched up another number from memory and said, Hi, Captain Martens.Its me.I think I know what you were trying to help me see.I wasnt ready for it then, but it stuck with me.So you didnt waste your time.I get it now.I know this wasnt my fault.I know I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.Im going back to the start now because I understand.Not angry, not hurt, not blaming myself.Just my duty to finish the fight.Something loosened in her chest the moment she hit the send button.All the threads had been neatly tied up, and now she could go to Io and do what she needed to do without regret.She let out a long sigh and slid down in the crash couch until she was almost prone.She suddenly felt bone tired.Like she could sleep for a week.She wondered if anyone would get mad if she just crashed out in ops instead of going all the way back down the lift.She didnt remember having fallen asleep, but here she was stretched out in the comm stations crash couch, a small puddle of drool next to her head.To her relief, her robe seemed to have remained mostly in place, so at least she hadnt bare assed everyone walking through.Gunny?Holden said in a tone of voice that meant he was saying it again.He was standing over her, a concerned look on his face.Sorry, sorry, she said, sitting up and pulling her robe more tightly around her middle.I needed to send out some messages last night.Must have been more tired than I thought.Yeah, Holden said.Its no problem.Sleep wherever you like.Okay, Bobbie said, backing toward the crew ladder.With that, I think Ill go down and take a shower and try to turn back into a human.Holden nodded as she went, a strange smile on his face.Sure.Meet me in the machine shop when youre dressed.Roger that, she said, and bolted down the ladder.After a decadently long shower and a change into her clean red and gray utility uniform, she grabbed a cup of coffee from the galley and made her way back down to the machine shop.Holden was already there.He had a crate the size of a guitar case sitting on one of the workbenches, and a larger square crate next to his feet on the deck.When she entered the compartment, he patted the crate on the table.This is for you.I saw when you came on board that you seemed to be missing yours.Bobbie hesitated a moment, then walked over to the crate and flipped it open.Inside sat a 2mm electrically fired three barrel Gatling gun, of the type the Marines designated a Thunderbolt Mark V.  It was new and shiny and exactly the type that would fit into her suit.This is amazing, Bobbie said after catching her breath.But its just an awkward club without ammo.Holden kicked the crate on the floor.Five thousand rounds of two millimeter caseless.Incendiary tipped.Incendiary?You forget, Ive seen the monster up close too.Armor piercing doesnt help at all.If anything, it reduces soft tissue damage.But since the lab stuck an incendiary bomb into all of them, I figure that means they arent fireproof.Bobbie lifted the heavy weapon out of the crate and put it on the floor next to her newly reassembled suit.Oh, hell yes.Forty Seven: Holden  H olden sat at the combat control console on the operations deck and watched Ragnarok gather.Admiral Souther, who Avasarala had assured everyone was one of the good guys, had joined his ships with their small but growing fleet of Martians as they sped toward Io.Waiting for them in orbit around that moon were the dozen ships in Admiral Nguyens fleet.More Martian and UN ships sped toward that location from Saturn and the Belt.By the time everyone got there, there would be something like thirty five capital ships in the kill zone, and dozens of smaller interceptors and corvettes, like the Rocinante.Three dozen capital ships.Holden tried to remember if there had ever been a fleet action of this size, and couldnt think of one.Including Admiral Nguyens and Admiral Southers flagships, there would be four Truman class UN dreadnoughts in the final tally, and the Martians would have three Donnager class battleships of their own, any one of which could depopulate a planet.The rest would be a mix of cruisers and destroyers.Not quite the heavy hitters the battleships were, but plenty powerful enough to vaporize the Rocinante.Which, if he was being honest, was the part Holden was most worried about.On paper, his team had the most ships.With Souther and the Martians joining forces, they outnumbered the Nguyen contingent two to one.But how many Earth ships would be willing to fire on their own, just because one admiral and a banished politician said so?It was entirely possible that if actual shooting started, a lot of UN ships might have unexplained comm failures and wait to see how it all came out.And that wasnt the worst case.The worst case was that a number of Southers ships would switch sides once Martians starting killing Earthers.The fight could turn into a whole lot of people pointing guns at each other, with no one knowing whom to trust.It could turn into a bloodbath.We have twice as many ships, Avasarala said from her constant perch at the comm station.Holden almost objected but changed his mind.In the end, it wouldnt matter.Avasarala would believe what she wanted to believe.She needed to think all her efforts had been worthwhile, that they were about to pay off when the fleet arrived and this Nguyen clown surrendered to her obviously superior force.The truth was her version wasnt any more or less a fantasy than his.No one would know for sure until everyone knew for sure.How long now?Avasarala said, then sipped at the bulb of weak coffee shed started making for herself in place of tea.Holden considered pointing out the navigation information the Roci made available at every console, and then didnt.Avasarala didnt want him to show her how to find it herself.She wanted him to tell her.She wasnt accustomed to pressing her own buttons.In her mind, she outranked him.Holden wondered what the chain of command actually looked like in this situation.How many illegal captains of stolen ships did it take to equal one disgraced UN official?That could tie a courtroom up for a few decades.He also wasnt being fair to Avasarala.It wasnt about making him take her orders, not really.It was about being in a situation that she was utterly untrained for, where she was the least useful person in the room and trying to assert some control.Trying to reshape the space around her to fit with her mental image of herself.Or maybe she just needed to hear a voice.Eighteen hours now, Holden said.Most of the other ships that arent part of our fleet will beat us there.And the ones that dont wont show up until its over, so we can ignore them.Eighteen hours, Avasarala said.There was something like awe in her voice.Space is too fucking big.Its the same old story.Hed guessed right.She just wanted to talk, so he let her.What story?Empire.Every empire grows until its reach exceeds its grasp.We started out fighting over who got the best branches in one tree.Then we climb down and fight over a few kilometers worth of trees.Then someone starts riding horses, and you get empires of hundreds or thousands of kilometers.Ships open up empire expansion across the oceans.The Epstein drive gave us the outer planets  She trailed off and tapped out something on the comm panel.She didnt volunteer who she was sending messages to, and Holden didnt ask.When she was done, she said, But the story is always the same.No matter how good your technology is, at some point youll conquer territory that you cant hold on to.Youre talking about the outer planets?Not specifically, she said, her voice growing soft and thoughtful.Im talking about the entire fucking concept of empire.The Brits couldnt hold on to India or North America because why should people listen to a king whos six thousand kilometers away?Holden tinkered with the air circulation nozzle on his panel, aiming it at his face.The cool air smelled faintly of ozone and oil.Logistics is always a problem.No kidding.Taking a dangerous trip six thousand kilometers across the Atlantic so you can fight with colonists gives the enemy one hell of a home court advantage.At least, Holden said, we Earthers figured that out before we picked a fight with Mars.Its even further.And sometimes the sun is in the way.Some people have never forgiven us for not humbling Mars when we had the chance, Avasarala said.I work for a few of them.Fucking idiots.I thought the point of your story was that those people always lose in the end.Those people, she said, pushing herself to her feet and slowly heading toward the crew ladder, are not the real problem.Venus might be housing the advance party of the first empire whose grasp is as long as its reach.And this fucking protomolecule has exposed us for the petty, small town bosses we are.Were getting ready to trade our solar system away because we thought we could build airports out of bamboo and summon the cargo.Get some sleep, Holden said to her while she called up the ladder lift.Well defeat one empire at a time.Maybe, she said as she dropped out of sight, and the deck hatch banged shut behind her.Why isnt anyone shooting?Prax said.Hed come up to the operations deck trailing after Naomi like a lost child.Now he was sitting at one of the many unused crash couches.He stared up at the main screen, his face a mix of fear and fascination.The big tactical display showed a muddled mass of red and green dots representing the three dozen capital ships parked in orbit around Io.The Roci had marked all the Earth ships green and the Martian ships red.It created a confusing simplicity out of what was in actuality a far more complex situation.Holden knew that friend or foe identification was going to be a problem if anyone started shooting.For now, the various ships drifted quietly above Io, their enormous threat merely implied.They made Holden think of the crocodiles hed seen at the zoo as a child.Huge, armored, filled with teeth, but drifting on the surface of the water like statues.Not even their eyes blinking.When food had been thrown into the pen, theyd exploded out of the water with frightening speed.Were just waiting for some blood to hit the water.Why isnt anyone shooting?Prax repeated.Hey, Doc, Amos said.He was lounging in one of the crash couches next to Prax.He projected a calm laziness that Holden wished he himself felt.Remember how on Ganymede we were facing down those guys with guns and no one was shooting right up until you decided to cock your gun?Prax blanched.Holden guessed he was remembering the bloody aftermath of that fight.Yes, Prax said.I remember.This is like that, Amos said.Only no ones cocked their gun just yet.Prax nodded.Okay.If someone finally did break the whole situation loose, Holden knew that figuring out who was shooting at whom would be their first problem.Avasarala, any word yet on the political landscape?Theres a whole lot of green on that board.How many of those dots belong to us?Avasarala shrugged and went on listening to the ship to ship cross talk.Naomi?Holden said.Any ideas?So far Nguyens fleet is targeting only Martian ships, she replied, marking ships on the main tactical board for everyone to see.The Martian ships are targeting back.Southers ships arent targeting anyone, and Souther hasnt even opened his tubes.Im guessing hes still hoping for a peaceful resolution.Please send the intel officer on Southers ship my compliments, Holden said to Naomi.And ask him to get us some new IFF data so this doesnt turn into the solar systems biggest clusterfuck.Done, Naomi said, and made the call.Get everyone buttoned up in their suits, Amos, Holden continued.Do a hat check here before you go below.I hope we dont start shooting, but what I hope will happen and what actually happens are almost never the same.Roger, Amos said, then climbed out of his couch and began clumping around the deck on magnetic boots, checking the seals on everyones helmets.Test test test, Holden said over the crew radio.One by one everyone on the ship responded with the affirmative.Until someone with a higher pay grade than his decided which way things were going to go, there wasnt much else he could do.Wait, Avasarala said, then hit a button on her console, and an outside channel started playing on their suit radios.launch immediately against targets on Mars.We have a battery of missiles carrying a lethal biological weapon ready to fire.You have one hour to leave Io orbit or we will launch immediately against targets on Mars.We have a   Avasarala turned the channel off again.It seems a third party has joined the circle jerk, Amos said.No, Avasarala replied.Its Nguyen.Hes outnumbered, so hes ordered his Mao cronies on the surface to make the threat to back us off.Hell Oh, shit.She hit her panel again and a new voice spoke over the radio.This one was a womans voice with a cultured Martian accent.Io, this is Admiral Muhan of the Martian Congressional Republic Navy.You fire anything bigger than a bottle rocket and we will glass the whole fucking moon.Do you read me?Amos leaned over to Prax.Now, you see, all this is them cocking their guns.Prax nodded.Got it.This, Holden said, listening to the barely restrained fury in the Martian admirals voice, is about to get seriously out of hand.This is Admiral Nguyen aboard the UNN Agatha King, a new voice said.Admiral Souther is here illegally, at the behest of a civilian UN official with no military authority.I hereby order all ships under Admiral Southers command to immediately stand down.I further order that the captain of Southers flagship place the admiral under arrest for treason and   Oh, do shut up, Souther replied over the same channel.Im here as part of a legal fact finding mission regarding improper use of UN funds and material for a secret biological weapon project on Io.A project which Admiral Nguyen is directly responsible for in contravention of UN directives   Avasarala cut the link.Oh, this aint good, Alex said.Well, Avasarala said, then opened the faceplate on her helmet and let out a long sigh.She opened her purse and pulled a pistachio out of it.She cracked it and thoughtfully ate the meat, then put the shell in the nearby recycling chute.A tiny bit of the skin floated away in the microgravity.No, actually, it should be fine.This is all posturing.As long as they keep comparing dicks, no one will shoot.But we cant just wait here, Prax said, shaking his head.Amos was floating in front of him, checking his helmet.Prax shoved him away and tried to get to his feet.He drifted away from his crash couch but didnt think to turn on his boot mags.If Mei is down there, we have to go.Theyre talking about glassing the moon.We have to get there before they do it.There was a high violin string whine at the back of Praxs voice.The tension was getting to him.It was getting to all of them, but Prax was the one who was going to show it worst and first.Holden shot a look at Amos, but the big man just looked surprised at having been pushed away by the much smaller scientist.Theyre talking about destroying the base.We have to go down there!Prax continued, the panic in his voice starting to shine through.Were not doing anything, Holden said.Not until we have a better idea how this is going to shake out.We came all this way so that we can not do anything?Prax demanded.Doc, we dont want to be the ones to move first, Amos said, and put a hand on Praxs shoulder, pulling him back down to the deck.The little botanist violently shrugged it off without turning around, then shoved off his couch toward Avasarala.Give me the channel.Let me talk to them, Prax said, reaching for her comm panel.I can   Holden launched himself out of his crash couch, catching the scientist mid flight and hurling them both across the deck and into the bulkhead.The thick layer of anti spalling padding absorbed their impact, but Holden felt the air go out of Prax when his hip slammed into the smaller mans belly.Gah, Prax said, and curled up into a floating fetal ball.Holden kicked on his boot mags and pushed himself down to the deck.He grabbed Prax and pushed him across the compartment to Amos.Take him below, stuff him in his bunk, and sedate the shit out of him.Then get to engineering and get us ready for a fight.Amos nodded and grabbed the floating Prax.Okay.A moment later the two of them disappeared down the deck hatch.Holden looked around the room, seeing the shocked looks from Avasarala and Naomi but ignoring them.Praxs need for his daughter to take precedence over everything else had almost put them all in danger again.And while Holden intellectually understood the mans drive, having to stop him from killing them all every time Meis name came up was stress he didnt need right then.It left him angry and needing to snap at someone.Where the hell is Bobbie?he said to no one in particular.He hadnt seen her since they had put in to orbit around Io.Just saw her in the machine shop, Amos replied over the radio.She was fieldstripping my shotgun.I think shes doing all the guns and armor.Thats  Holden started, ready to yell about something.Thats actually really helpful.Tell her to button up her suit and turn her radio on.Things might be going south in a hurry here.He took a few seconds to breathe and calm himself down, then returned to the combat operations station.You okay?Naomi asked over their private channel.No, he said, chinning the button to make sure only she heard his reply.No, Im actually scared to death.I thought we were past that.Past being scared?No, she said, the smile audible in her voice.Past blaming yourself for it.Im scared too.I love you, Holden said, feeling that same electric thrill he always got when he told her, part fear, part boast.You should probably keep your eye on your station, she said, her tone teasing.She never told him she loved him when he said it first.Shed said that when people did it too often, it made the word lose all its power.He understood the argument, but hed kind of hoped shed break her rule this once.He needed to hear it.Avasarala was hunched over the comm station like an ancient mystic peering into a murky crystal ball.The space suit hung on her like a scarecrows oversized coveralls.Holden considered ordering her to button up her helmet, then shrugged.She was old enough to decide for herself the relative risks and rewards of eating during a battle.Periodically she reached into her purse and pulled out another nut.The air around her was a growing cloud of tiny pieces of pistachio skin.It was annoying to watch her cluttering up his ship, but no warship was built so fragile that a little airborne waste would break anything.Either the tiny pieces of shell would be sucked into the air recycling system and trapped by the filters, or theyd go under thrust and all the garbage would fall to the floor, where they could sweep it up.Holden wondered if Avasarala had ever had to clean anything in her life.While he watched her, the old lady cocked her head to one side, listening with sudden interest to something only she could hear.Her hand darted forward, bird quick, to tap at the screen.A new voice came over the ships radios, this one with the faint hiss transmissions picked up when traveling for millions of kilometers through space.eneral Esteban Sorrento Gillis.Some time ago, I announced the formation of an exploratory committee to look into possible misuse of UN resources for illegal biological weapon research.While that investigation is ongoing, and the committee is not prepared to bring charges at this time, in the interests of public safety and to better facilitate a thorough and comprehensive investigation, certain UN personnel in key positions are to be recalled to Earth for questioning.First, Admiral Augusto Nguyen, of the United Nations Navy.Second   Avasarala hit the panel to shut off the feed and stared at the console with her mouth open for several seconds.Oh, fuck me.All over the ship, alarms started blaring.Forty Eight: Avasarala  Ive got fast movers, Naomi said over the blaring alarms.The UN flagship is firing.Avasarala closed her helmet, watching the in suit display confirm the seal, then tapped at the communications console, her mind moving faster than her hands.Errinwright had cut a deal, and now Nguyen knew it.The admiral had just been hung out to dry, and he was taking it poorly.A flag popped up on the console: incoming high priority broadcast.She thumbed it, and Souther appeared on her terminal and every other one in the ops deck.This is Admiral Souther.I am hereby taking command of   Okay, Naomi said.I need my real screen back now.Got some work to do.Sorry, sorry, Avasarala said, tapping at the console.Wrong button.this task force.Admiral Nguyen is relieved of duty.Any hostilities will be    Avasarala switched the feed to her own screen and in the process switched to a different broadcast.Nguyen was flushed almost purple.He was wearing his uniform like a boast.illegal and unprecedented seizure.Admiral Souther is to be escorted to the brig until   Five incoming comm requests lit up, each listing a name and short form transponder ID.She ignored them all for the broadcast controls.As soon as the live button went active, she looked into the camera.This is Assistant Undersecretary Chrisjen Avasarala, representing the civilian government of Earth, she said.Legal and appropriate command of this force is given to Admiral Souther.Anyone rejecting or ignoring his orders will be subject to legal action.I repeat, Admiral Souther is in legally authorized command of   Naomi made a low grunting sound.Avasarala stopped the broadcast and turned.Okay, Holden said.That was bad.What?Avasarala said.What was bad?One of the Earth ships just took three torpedo hits.It that a lot?The PDCs arent stopping them, Naomi said.Those UN torpedoes all have transponder codes that mark them as friends, so theyre sailing right through.They typically dont expect to be getting shot at by other UN ships.Three is a lot, Holden said, strapping into the crash couch.She didnt see him touch any of the controls, but he must have, because when he spoke, it echoed through the ship as well as the speakers in her helmet.We have just gone live.Everyone has to the count of twenty to get strapped in someplace safe.Solid copy on that, Bobbie replied from wherever she was on the ship.Just got the doc strapped in and happy, Amos said.Im on my way to engineering.Are we heading into this?Alex asked.Weve got something like thirty five capital ships out there, all of them much, much bigger than us.How about we just try to keep anyone from shooting us full of holes.Yes, sir, Alex said from the pilots deck.Any vestige of democracy and vote taking was gone.That was a good thing.At least Holden had control when there had to be a single voice in command.I have two fast movers coming in, Naomi said.Someone still thinks were the bad guys.I blame Avasarala, Bobbie said.Before Avasarala could laugh, gravity ticked up and slewed to the side, the Rocinante taking action beneath her.Her couch shifted and creaked.The protective gel squeezed her and let her go.Alex?On em, Alex said.I wouldnt mind getting a real gunner, sir.Are we going to have enough time to get her up here safely?Nope, Alex said.Ive got three more incoming.I can take PDC control from here, sir, Bobbie said.Its not the real thing, but its something the rest of you wont have to do.Naomi, give the PDCs to the sergeant.PDC control transferred.Its all yours, Bobbie.Taking control, Bobbie said.Avasaralas screen was a tangle of incoming messages in a flickering array.She started going through them.The Kennedy was announcing that Southers command was illegal.The Tritons first officer was reporting that the captain had been relieved of duty, and requested orders from Souther.The Martian destroyer Iani Chaos was trying to reach Avasarala for clarification of which Earth ships it was permitted to shoot at.She pulled up the tactical display.Circles in red and green marked the swarm of ships; tiny silver threads showed what might have been streams of PDC fire or the paths of torpedoes.Are we red or green?Avasarala asked.Whos who on this fucking thing?Mars is red, Earth is green, Naomi said.And which Earth ones are on our side?Find out, Holden said as one of the green dots suddenly vanished.Alex?The Darius took the safeties off its PDCs, and now its spraying down everything in range whether its friend or foe.And shit.Avasaralas chair shifted again, seeming to rise from under her, pressing her back into the gel until it was hard to lift her arms.On the tactical screen, the cloud of ships, enemy and friendly and ambiguous, shifted slightly, and two golden dots grew larger, proximity notations beside them counting quickly down.Madam Assistant whatever you are, Holden said, you could respond to some of those comm requests now.Avasaralas gut felt like someone was squeezing it from below.The taste of salt and stomach acid haunted the back of her tongue.She was beginning to sweat in a way that had less to do with temperature than nausea.She forced her hands out to the control panel just as the two golden dots vanished.Thank you, Bobbie, Alex said.Im heading up.Gonna try to get the Martians between us and the fighting.She started making calls.In the heat of a battle, all she had to offer was this: making calls.Talking.The same things she always did.Something about it was actually reassuring.The Greenville was accepting Southers command.The Tanaka wasnt responding.The Dyson opened the channel, but the only sound was men shouting at each other.It was bedlam.A message came in from Souther, and she accepted it.It included a new IFF code, and she manually accepted the update.On the tactical, most of the green dots shifted to white.Thank you, Holden said.Avasarala swallowed her Youre welcome.The antinausea drugs seemed to be working for everyone else.She really, really didnt want to throw up inside her helmet.One of the six remaining green dots blinked out of existence and another turned suddenly to white.Ooh, right in the back, Alex said.That was cold.Southers ID showed up again on Avasaralas console, and she hit accept just as the Roci shifted again.the immediate surrender of the flagship King and Admiral Augusto Nguyen, Souther was saying.His shock of white hair was standing up off his head as if the low thrust gravity was letting it expand like a peacocks tail.His smile was sharp as a knife.Any vessel that still refuses to acknowledge my orders as legal and legitimate will forfeit this amnesty.You have thirty seconds from this mark.On the tactical display, the threads of silver and gold had, for the most part, vanished.The ships shifted positions, each moving along its own complex vectors.As she watched, all the remaining green dots turned to white.All except one.Dont be an asshole, Nguyen, Avasarala said.Its over.The ops deck was silent for a long moment, the tension almost unbearable.Naomis voice was the one to break it.Ive got more fast movers.Oh, Ive got a lot of them.Where?Holden snapped.From the surface.Avasarala didnt do anything, but her tactical display resized, pulling back until the cluster of ships, red and white and the single defiant green, were less than a quarter of their original size and the massive curve of the moons surface impinged on the lower edge of the display.Rising like a solid mass, hundreds of fine yellow lines.Get me a count, Holden said.I need a count here.Two hundred nineteen.No.Wait.Two hundred thirty.What the hell are they?Are those torpedoes?Alex asked.No, Bobbie said.Theyre monsters.They launched the monsters.Avasarala opened a broadcast channel.Her hair probably looked worse than Southers but she was well past vanity.That she could speak without fear of vomiting was blessing enough.This is Avasarala, she said.The launch you are all seeing right now is a new protomolecule based weapon that is being used as an unauthorized first strike against Mars.We need to shoot those fuckers out of the sky and do it now.Everyone.Weve got a coordination override request coming through from Southers flagship, Naomi said.Surrender control?The hell I will, Alex said.No, but track requests, Holden said.Im not handing control of my ship to a military fire control computer, but we still need to be part of the solution here.The Kings starting a hard burn, Alex said.I think hes trying to hightail it.On the display, the attack from the surface of Io was beginning to bloom, individual threads coming apart in unexpected angles, some corkscrewing, some reaching out in bent paths like an insects articulated legs.Any one of them was the death of a planet, and the acceleration data put them at ten, fifteen, twenty gs.Nothing human survived at a sustained twenty g.  Nothing human had to.Golden flickers of light appeared from the ships, drifting down to meet the threads of Io.The slow, stately pace of the display was undercut by the data.Plasma torpedoes burning full out, and yet it took long seconds for them to reach the main stem.Avasarala watched the first of them detonate, saw the column of protomolecule monsters split into a dozen different streams.Evasive action.Some of those are coming toward us, Cap, Alex said.I dont think theyre designed to hole a ships hull, but Im pretty damn sure theyd do it anyway.Lets get in there and do what we can.We cant let any of these   Okay, whered they go?On the tactical display, the attacking monsters were blinking out of existence, the threads vanishing.Theyre cutting thrust, Naomi said.And the RF transponders are going dark.Must have radar absorbing hull materials.Do we have tracking data?Can we anticipate where theyre going to be?The tactical display began to flicker.Fireflies.The monsters shifting in and out, thrusting in what looked like semi random directions, but the bloom of them always expanding.This is going to be a bitch, Alex said.Bobbie?Ive got some target locks.Get us in PDC range.Hang on, kids, Alex said.Were going for a ride.The Roci bucked hard, and Avasarala pressed back into her seat.The shuddering rhythm seemed to be her own trembling muscles and then the firing PDCs and then her body again.On the display, the combined forces of Earth and Mars spread out, running after the near invisible foes.Thrust gravity shifted, spinning her couch one way and then another without warning.She tried closing her eyes, but that was worse.Hmm.What, Naomi?Holden said.Hmm what?The King was doing something strange there.Huge activity from the maneuvering thrusters and Oh.Oh what?Nouns.I need nouns.Shes holed, Naomi said.One of the monsters holed her.Told you they could do that, Alex said.Hate to be on the ship right now.Still.Couldnt have happened to a nicer fella.His men arent responsible for his actions, Bobbie said.They may not even know Southers in command.Weve got to help them.We cant, Holden said.Theyll shoot at us.Would you all please shut the fuck up?Avasarala said.And stop moving the goddamned ship around.Just pick a direction and calm down for two minutes.Her comm request went ignored for five minutes.Then ten.When the Kings distress beacon kicked in, she still hadnt answered.A broadcast signal came in just after.This is Admiral Nguyen of the United Nations battleship Agatha King.I am offering to surrender to UN ships with the condition of immediate evacuation.Repeat: I am offering surrender to any United Nations military vessel on the condition of immediate evacuation.Souther answered on the same frequency.This is the Okimbo.Whats your situation?We have a possible biohazard, Nguyen said.His voice was so tight and high it sounded like someone was strangling him.On the tactical display, several white dots were already moving toward the green.Hold tight, King, Souther said.Were on our way.Like hell you are, Avasarala said, then cursed quietly as she opened a broadcast channel.Like hell you are.This is Avasarala.I am declaring a quarantine and containment order on the Agatha King.No vessel should dock with her or accept transfer of materiel or personnel.Any ship that does will be placed under a quarantine and containment order as well.Two of the white dots turned aside.Three others continued on.She opened the channel again.Am I the only one here who remembers Eros?What the fuck do you people think is loose on the King?Do not approach.The last of the white dots turned aside.When Nguyen answered her comm request, shed forgotten she still had it open.He looked like shit.She didnt imagine she looked much better.How many wars had ended this way?she wondered.Two exhausted, nauseated people staring at each other while the world burned around them.What more do you want from me?Nguyen said.Ive surrendered.I lost.My men shouldnt have to die for your spite.Its not spite, Avasarala said.We cant do it.The protomolecule gets loose.Your fancy control programs dont work.Its infectious.Thats not proven, he said, but the way he said it told her everything.Its happening, isnt it?she said.Turn on your internal cameras.Let us see.Im not going to do that.She felt the air go out of her.It had happened.I am so sorry, Avasarala said.Oh.I am so sorry.Nguyens eyebrows rose a millimeter.His lips pressed, bloodless and thin.She thought there were tears in his eyes, but it might have been only a transmission artifact.You have to turn on the transponders, Avasarala said.And then, when he didnt reply: We cant weaponize the protomolecule.We dont understand what it is.We cant control it.You just sent a death sentence to Mars.I cant save you, I cannot.But turn those transponders back on and help me save them.The moment hung in the air.Avasarala could feel Holdens and Naomis attention on her like warmth radiating from the heating grate.Nguyen shook his head, his lips twitching, lost in conversation with himself.Nguyen, she said.Whats happening?On your ship.How bad is it?Get me out of here, and Ill turn the transponders on, he said.Throw me in the brig for the rest of my life, I dont care.But get me off of this ship.Avasarala tried to lean forward, but it only made her crash couch shift.She looked for the words that would bring him back, the ones that would tell him that he had been wrong and evil and now he was going to die badly at the hands of his own weapon and somehow make it all right.She looked at this angry, small, shortsighted, frightened little man and tried to find the way to pull him back to simple human decency.She failed.I cant do that, she said.Then stop wasting my time, he said, and cut the connection.She lay back, her palm over her eyes.Im gettin some mighty strange readings off that battleship, Alex said.Naomi?You seeing this?Sorry.Give me a second.What have you got, Alex?Holden asked.Reactor activitys down.Internal radiation through the ships spiking huge.Its like theyre venting the reactor into the air recycling.That dont sound healthy, Amos said.The ops deck went silent again.Avasarala reached to open a channel to Souther but stopped.She didnt know what shed say.The voice that came over the ship channel was slushy and drugged.She didnt recognize Prax at first, and then he had to repeat himself twice before she could make out the words.Incubation chamber, Prax said.Its making the ship an incubation chamber.Like on Eros.It knows how to do that?Bobbie said.Apparently so, Naomi said.Were going to have to slag that thing, Bobbie said.Do we have enough firepower for that?Avasarala opened her eyes again.She tried to feel something besides great, oceanic sorrow.There had to be hope in there somewhere.Even Pandora got that much.Holden was the one who said what she was thinking.Even if we can, it wont save Mars.Maybe we got them all?Alex said.I mean, there were a shit load of those things, but maybe maybe we got em?Hard to tell when they were running ballistic, Bobbie said.If we missed just one, and it gets to Mars  It was all slipping away from her.She had been so close to stopping it, and now here she was, watching it all slip past.Her gut was a solid knot.But they hadnt failed.Not yet.Somewhere in all this there had to be a way.Something that could still be done.She forwarded her last conversation with Nguyen to Souther.Maybe hed have an idea.A secret weapon that could come out of nowhere and force the codes out.Maybe the great brotherhood of military men would draw some vestige of humanity out of Nguyen.Ten minutes later, a survival pod came loose from the King.Souther didnt bother contacting her before they shot it down.The ops deck was like a mourning chamber.Okay, Holden said.First things first.Weve got to get down to the base.If Meis there, we need to get her out.Im on that, Amos said.And we got to take the doc.He aint gonna outsource that one.Thats what I was thinking, Holden said.So you guys take the Roci down to the surface.Us guys?Naomi asked.Ill take the pinnace over to the battleship, Holden said.The transponder activation codes are going to be in the CIC.You?Avasarala asked.Only two people got off Eros, Holden said with a shrug.And Im the one thats left.Forty Nine: Holden  Dont do this, Naomi said.She didnt beg, or cry, or make demands.All the power of her request lay in its quiet simplicity.Dont do it.Holden opened the suit locker just outside the main airlock and reached for his Martian made armor.A sudden and visceral memory of radiation sickness on Eros stopped him.Theyve been pumping radiation into the King for hours now, right?Dont go over there, Naomi said again.Bobbie, Holden said over the comm.Here, she replied with a grunt.She was helping Amos prep their gear for the assault on the Mao science station.After his one encounter with the Mao protomolecule hybrid, he could only imagine they were going loaded for bear.What are these standard Martian armor suits rated for radiation wise?Like mine?Bobbie asked.No, not a powered suit.I know they harden you guys for close proximity blasts.Im talking about this stuff we pulled out of the MAP crate.About as much as a standard vacuum suit.Good enough for short walks outside the ship.Not so much for constant exposure to high radiation levels.Shit, Holden said.Then: Thanks.He killed the comm panel and closed the locker.Ill need a full on hazard suit.Which means Ill be better in the radiation, and not bullet resistant at all.How many times can you get yourself massively irradiated before it catches up with you?Naomi said.Same as last time.At least one more, Holden replied with a grin.Naomi didnt smile back.He hit the comm again and said, Amos, bring me up a hazard suit from engineering.Whatevers the hardest thing weve got on board.Okay, Amos replied.Holden opened his equipment locker and took out the assault rifle he kept there.It was large, black, and designed to be intimidating.It would immediately mark anyone who carried it as a threat.He put it back and decided on a pistol instead.The hazmat suit would make him fairly anonymous.It was the sort of thing any member of the damage control team might wear during an emergency.If he was wearing only a service pistol in a hip holster, it might keep anyone from singling him out as part of the problem.And with the protomolecule loose on the King, and the ship flooded with radiation, there would be a big problem.Because if Prax and Avasarala were right, and the protomolecule was linked even without a physical connection, then the goo on the King knew what the goo on Venus knew.Part of that was how human spaceships were put together, ever since it had disassembled the Arboghast.But it also meant it knew a lot about how to turn humans into vomit zombies.It had performed that trick a million times or so on Eros.It had practice.It was entirely possible that every single human on the King was now a vomit zombie.And sadly, that was the best case scenario.Vomit zombies were walking death to anyone with exposed skin, but to Holden, in his fully sealed and vacuum rated hazmat suit, they would be at worst a mild annoyance.The worst case scenario was that the protomolecule was so good at changing humans now, the ship would be full of lethal hybrids like the one hed fought in the cargo bay.That would be an impossible situation, so he chose to believe it wasnt true.Besides, the protomolecule hadnt made any soldiers on Eros.Miller hadnt really taken the time to describe what hed run into there, but hed spent a lot of time on the station looking for Julie and hed never reported being attacked by anything.The protomolecule was incredibly aggressive and invasive.It would kill a million humans in hours and turn them into spare parts for whatever it was working on.But it invaded at the cellular level.It acted like a virus, not an army.Just keep telling yourself that, Holden thought.It made what he was about to do seem possible.He took a compact semiautomatic pistol and holster out of the locker.Naomi watched while he loaded the weapons magazine and three spares, but she didnt speak.He had just pushed the last round into the final magazine when Amos floated into the compartment, dragging a large red suit behind him.This is our best, Cap, he said.For when shit has gone truly wrong.Should be plenty for the levels theyve got in that ship.Max exposure time is six hours, but the air supply only lasts two, so thats not an issue.Holden examined the bulky suit.The surface was a thick, flexible rubbery substance.It might deter someone attacking with their fingernails or teeth, but it wouldnt stop a knife or a bullet.The air supply was contained under the suits radiation resistant skin, so it made for a big, awkward lump on the wearers back.The difficulty he had pulling the suit to himself and then stopping it told him its mass was considerable.Wont be moving fast in this, will I?No, Amos said with a grimace.Theyre not made for a firefight.If the bullets start flying, youre fucked.Naomi nodded but said nothing.Amos, Holden said, grabbing the mechanics arm as he turned to leave.The gunnys in charge once you hit the surface.Shes a pro, and this is her show.But I need you to keep Prax safe, because hes kind of an idiot.The only thing I ask you to do is get that man and his little girl safely off the moon and back to this ship.Amos looked hurt for a moment.Of course I will, Captain.Anything that gets to him or that baby will already have killed me.And that aint easy to do.Holden pulled Amos to him and gave the big man a quick hug.I feel sorry for anything that tries.No one could ask for a better crewman, Amos.Just want you to know that.Amos pushed him away.You act like youre not coming back.Holden shot a look at Naomi, but her expression hadnt changed.Amos just laughed for a minute, then clapped Holden on the back hard enough to rattle his teeth.Thats bullshit, Amos said.Youre the toughest guy I know.Without waiting for Holden to reply, he headed out to the crew ladder, and then down to the deck below.Naomi pushed lightly against the bulkhead and drifted over to Holden.Air resistance brought her to a stop half a meter from him.She was still the most agile person in microgravity hed ever met, a ballerina of null g.  He had to stop himself from hugging her to him.The expression on her face told him it wasnt what she wanted.She just floated in front of him for a moment, not saying anything, then reached out and put one long, slender hand against his cheek.It felt cool and soft.Dont go, she said, and something in her voice told him it would be the last time.He backed up and began shrugging his way into the hazmat suit.Then who?Can you see Avasarala fighting through a mob of vomit zombies?She wouldnt know the CIC from the galley.Amos has to go get that little girl.You know he does, and you know why.Prax has to be there.Bobbie keeps them both alive.He got the bulky suit over his shoulders and sealed up the front but left the helmet lying against his back.The boot mags came on when he hit them with his heels, and he pushed down to the deck and stuck there.You?he asked Naomi.Do I send you?Id bet on you against a thousand zombies any day of the week.But you dont know the CIC any better than Avasarala does.How does that make sense?We just got right again, she said.Thats not fair.But, he said, tell the Martians that me saving their planet makes us even on this whole you stole our warship issue, okay?He knew he was making light of the moment and immediately hated himself for it.But Naomi knew him, knew how afraid he was, and she didnt call him on it.He felt a rush of love for her that sent electricity up his spine and made his scalp tingle.Fine, she said, her face hardening.But youre coming back.Ill be here on the radio the whole time.Well work through this together, every step.No hero bullshit.Brains instead of bullets, and we work the problems together.You give me that.You better give me that.Holden finally pulled her into his arms and kissed her.I agree.Please, please help me make it back alive.Id really like that.Flying the Razorback to the crippled Agatha King was like taking a race car to the corner market.The King was only a few thousand kilometers from the Rocinante.It seemed close enough for an EVA pack and a really strong push.Instead, he flew what was probably the fastest ship in the Jupiter system in teakettle mode at about 5 percent thrust through the debris of the recent battle.He could sense the Razorback straining at the leash, responding to his tiny bursts of steam with sullen reproach.The distance to the stricken flagship was short enough, and the path treacherous enough, that programming in a course would take more time than just flying by stick.But even at his languid pace, the Razorback seemed to have a hard time keeping its nose pointed at the King.You dont want to go there, the ship seemed to be saying.Thats an awful place.No, no, I really dont, he said, patting the console in front of him.But just get me there in one piece, okay, honey?A massive chunk of what must have once been a destroyer floated past, the ragged edges still glowing with heat.Holden tapped the stick and pushed the Razorback sideways to get a bit more distance from the floating wreckage.The nose drifted off course.Fight all you want, were still going to the same place.Some part of Holden was disappointed that the transit was so dangerous.Hed never flown to Io before, and the view of the moon at the edge of his screens was spectacular.A massive volcano of molten silicate on the opposite side of the moon was throwing particles so high into space he could see the trail it left in the sky.The plume cooled into a spray of silicate crystals, which caught Jupiters glow and glittered like diamonds scattered across the black.Some of them would drift off to become part of Jupiters faint ring system, blown right out of Ios gravity well.In any other circumstance, it would have been beautiful.But the hazardous flight kept his attention on his instruments and the screens in front of him.And always, the growing bulk of the Agatha King, floating alone at the center of the junk cloud.When he was within range, Holden signaled the ships automated docking system, but as hed suspected, the King didnt respond.He piloted up to the nearest external airlock and told the Razorback to maintain a constant distance of five meters.The racing ship was not designed to dock with another ship in space.It lacked even a rudimentary docking tube.His trip to the King would be a short spacewalk.Avasarala had gotten a master override code from Souther, and Holden had the Razorback transmit it.The airlock immediately cycled open.Holden topped off the hazmat suits air supply in the Razorbacks airlock.Once he got onto Nguyens flagship, he couldnt trust the air, even in the suit recharging stations.Nothing from the King could be allowed inside his suit.Nothing.When his stored air gauge read 100 percent, he turned on the radio and called Naomi.Im going in now.He kicked off his boot mags, and a sharp push against the inner airlock door sent him across the short gap to the King.Im getting a good picture, Naomi said.The video link light on his HUD was on.Naomi could see everything he could see.It was comforting and lonely at the same time, like making a call to a friend who lived very far away.Holden cycled the airlock.The two minutes while the King closed the outer door and then pumped air into the chamber seemed to last forever.
