So your request for Anything, oh God, ANYTHING but Disco is denied.Enjoy your boogie fever.Also, an uncomfortable side note NASA is putting together a committee.They want to see if there were any avoidable mistakes that led you to being stranded.Just a heads up.They may have questions for you later on.Keep us posted on your activities.Kapoor  My reply:  Venkat, tell the investigation committee theyll have to do their witch hunt without me.And when they inevitably blame Commander Lewis, be advised Ill publicly refute it.Im sure the rest of the crew will do the same.Also, please tell them that each and every one of their mothers is a prostitute.Watney  PS: Their sisters, too.The presupply probes for Ares 3 launched on fourteen consecutive days during the Hohmann Transfer Window.Presupply 309 was launched third.The 251 day trip to Mars was uneventful, needing only two minor course adjustments.After several aerobraking maneuvers to slow down, it made its final descent toward Acidalia Planitia.First, it endured reentry via a heat shield.Later, it released a parachute and detached the now expended shield.Once its onboard radar detected it was thirty meters from the ground, it cut loose the parachute and inflated balloons all around its hull.It fell unceremoniously to the surface, bouncing and rolling, until it finally came to rest.Deflating its balloons, the onboard computer reported the successful landing back to Earth.Then it waited twenty three months.LOG ENTRY: SOL 117  The water reclaimer is acting up.Six people will go through 18 liters of water per day.So its made to process 20.But lately, it hasnt been keeping up.Its doing 10, tops.Do I generate 10 liters of water per day?No, Im not the urinating champion of all time.Its the crops.The humidity inside the Hab is a lot higher than it was designed for, so the water reclaimer is constantly filtering it out of the air.Im not worried about it.If need be, I can piss directly onto the plants.The plants will take their share of water and the rest will condense on the walls.I could make something to collect the condensation, Im sure.Thing is, the water cant go anywhere.Its a closed system.Okay, technically Im lying.The plants arent entirely water neutral.They strip the hydrogen from some of it (releasing the oxygen) and use it to make the complex hydrocarbons that are the plant itself.But its a very small loss and I made like 600 liters of water from MDV fuel.I could take baths and still have plenty left over.NASA, however, is absolutely shitting itself.They see the water reclaimer as a critical survival element.Theres no backup, and they think Ill die instantly without it.To them, equipment failure is terrifying.To me, its Tuesday.So instead of preparing for my harvest, I have to make extra trips to and from the rover to answer their questions.Each new message instructs me to try some new solution and report the results back.So far as weve worked out its not the electronics, refrigeration system, instrumentation, or temperature.Im sure itll turn out to be a little hole somewhere, then NASA will have four hours of meetings before telling me to cover it with duct tape.Lewis and Beck opened Presupply 309.Working as best they could in their bulky EVA suits, they removed the various portions of Hab canvas and laid them on the ground.Three entire presupply probes were dedicated to the Hab.Following a procedure they had practiced hundreds of times, they efficiently assembled the pieces.Special seal strips between the patches ensured airtight mating.After erecting the main structure of the Hab, they assembled the three airlocks.Sheet AL102 had a hole perfectly sized for Airlock 1.Beck stretched the sheet tight to the seal strips on the airlocks exterior.Once all airlocks were in place, Lewis flooded the Hab with air and AL102 felt pressure for the first time.Lewis and Beck waited an hour.No pressure was lost; the setup had been perfect.LOG ENTRY: SOL 118  My conversation with NASA about the water reclaimer was boring and riddled with technical details.So Ill paraphrase it for you:  Me: This is obviously a clog.How about I take it apart and check the internal tubing?NASA: (after five hours of deliberation) No.Youll fuck it up and die.So I took it apart.Yeah, I know.NASA has a lot of ultra smart people and I should really do what they say.And Im being too adversarial, considering they spend all day working on how to save my life.I just get sick of being told how to wipe my ass.Independence was one of the qualities they looked for when choosing Ares astronauts.Its a thirteen month mission, most of it spent many light minutes away from Earth.They wanted people who would act on their own initiative.If Commander Lewis were here, Id do whatever she said, no problem.But a committee of faceless bureaucrats back on Earth?Sorry, Im just having a tough time with it.I was really careful.I labeled every piece as I dismantled it, and laid everything out on a table.I have the schematics in the computer, so nothing was a surprise.And just as Id suspected, there was a clogged tube.The water reclaimer was designed to purify urine and strain humidity out of the air (you exhale almost as much water as you piss).Ive mixed my water with soil, making it mineral water.The minerals built up in the water reclaimer.I cleaned out the tubing and put it all back together.It completely solved the problem.Ill have to do it again someday, but not for a hundred sols or so.No big deal.I told NASA what I did.Our (paraphrased) conversation was:  Me: I took it apart, found the problem, and fixed it.NASA: Dick.AL102 shuddered in the brutal storm.Withstanding forces far greater than it was designed for, it rippled violently against the airlock seal strip.Other sections of canvas undulated along their seal strips together, acting as a single sheet, but AL102 had no such luxury.The airlock barely moved, leaving AL102 to take the full force of the tempest.The layers of plastic, constantly bending, heated the resin from pure friction.The new, more yielding environment allowed the carbon fibers to separate.AL102 stretched.Not much.Only four millimeters.But the carbon fibers, usually 500 microns apart, now had a gap eight times that width in their midst.After the storm abated, the lone remaining astronaut performed a full inspection of the Hab.But he didnt notice anything amiss.The weak part of canvas was concealed by a seal strip.Designed for a mission of thirty one sols, AL102 continued well past its planned expiration.Sol after sol went by, with the lone astronaut traveling in and out of the Hab almost daily.Airlock 1 was closest to the rover charging station, so the astronaut preferred it to the other two.When pressurized, the airlock expanded slightly; when depressurized, it shrunk.Every time the astronaut used the airlock, the strain on AL102 relaxed, then tightened anew.Pulling, stressing, weakening, stretching      LOG ENTRY: SOL 119  I woke up last night to the Hab shaking.The medium grade sandstorm ended as suddenly as it began.It was only a category three storm with 50 kph winds.Nothing to worry about.Still, its a bit disconcerting to hear howling winds when youre used to utter silence.Im worried about Pathfinder.If the sandstorm damaged it, Ill have lost my connection to NASA.Logically, I shouldnt worry.The things been on the surface for decades.A little gale wont do any harm.When I head outside, Ill confirm Pathfinders still functional before moving on to the sweaty, annoying work of the day.Yes, with each sandstorm comes the inevitable Cleaning of the Solar Cells, a time honored tradition among hearty Martians such as myself.It reminds me of growing up in Chicago and having to shovel snow.Ill give my dad credit; he never claimed it was to build character or teach me the value of hard work.Snowblowers are expensive, he used to say.Youre free.Once, I tried to appeal to my mom.Dont be such a wuss, she suggested.In other news, its seven sols till the harvest, and I still havent prepared.For starters, I need to make a hoe.Also, I need to make an outdoor shed for the potatoes.I cant just pile them up outside.The next major storm would cause the Great Martian Potato Migration.Anyway, all that will have to wait.Ive got a full day today.After cleaning the solar cells, I have to check the whole solar array to make sure the storm didnt hurt it.Then Ill need to do the same for the rover.I better get started.*  Airlock 1 slowly depressurized to 0.006 atmospheres.Watney, wearing an EVA suit, stood inside it waiting for the cycle to complete.He had done it literally hundreds of times.Any apprehension he may have had on Sol 1 was long gone.Now it was merely a boring chore before exiting to the surface.As the depressurization continued, the Habs atmosphere compressed the airlock, and AL102 stretched for the last time.On Sol 119, the Hab breached.The initial tear was less than one millimeter.The perpendicular carbon fibers should have prevented the rip from growing.But countless abuses had stretched the vertical fibers apart and weakened the horizontal ones beyond use.The full force of the Habs atmosphere rushed through the breach.Within a tenth of a second, the rip was a meter long, running parallel to the seal strip.It propagated all the way around until it met its starting point.The airlock was no longer attached to the Hab.The unopposed pressure launched the airlock like a cannonball as the Habs atmosphere explosively escaped through the breach.Inside, the surprised Watney slammed against the airlocks back door with the force of the expulsion.The airlock flew forty meters before hitting the ground.Watney, barely recovered from the earlier shock, now endured another as he hit the front door, face first.His faceplate took the brunt of the blow, the safety glass shattering into hundreds of small cubes.His head slammed against the inside of the helmet, knocking him senseless.The airlock tumbled across the surface for a further fifteen meters.The heavy padding of Watneys suit saved him from many broken bones.He tried to make sense of the situation, but he was barely conscious.Finally done tumbling, the airlock rested on its side amid a cloud of dust.Watney, on his back, stared blankly upward through the hole in his shattered faceplate.A gash in his forehead trickled blood down his face.Regaining some of his wits, he got his bearings.Turning his head to the side, he looked through the back doors window.The collapsed Hab rippled in the distance, a junkyard of debris strewn across the landscape in front of it.Then, a hissing sound reached his ears.Listening carefully, he realized it was not coming from his suit.Somewhere in the phone boothsized airlock, a small breach was letting air escape.He listened intently to the hiss, then he touched his broken faceplate.Then he looked out the window again.You fucking kidding me?he said.Chapter 14      AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119  You know what!?Fuck this!Fuck this airlock, fuck that Hab, and fuck this whole planet!Seriously, this is it!Ive had it!Ive got a few minutes before I run out of air and Ill be damned if I spend them playing Marss little game.Im so god damned sick of it I could puke!All I have to do is sit here.The air will leak out and Ill die.Ill be done.No more getting my hopes up, no more self delusion, and no more problem solving.Ive fucking had it!AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (2)  Sigh okay.Ive had my tantrum and now I have to figure out how to stay alive.Again.Okay, lets see what I can do here  Im in the airlock.I can see the Hab out the window; its a good 50 meters away.Normally, the airlock is attached to the Hab.So thats a problem.The airlocks on its side, and I can hear a steady hiss.So either its leaking or there are snakes in here.Either way, Im in trouble.Also, during the whatever the fuck happened I got bounced around like a pinball and smashed my faceplate.Air is notoriously uncooperative when it comes to giant, gaping holes in your EVA suit.Looks like the Hab is completely deflated and collapsed.So even if I had a functional EVA suit to leave the airlock with, I wouldnt have anywhere to go.So that sucks.I gotta think for a minute.And I have to get out of this EVA suit.Its bulky, and the airlock is cramped.Besides, its not like its doing me any good.AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (3)  Things arent as bad as they seem.Im still fucked, mind you.Just not as deeply.Not sure what happened to the Hab, but the rovers probably fine.Its not ideal, but at least its not a leaky phone booth.I have a patch kit on my EVA suit, of course.The same kind that saved my life back on Sol 6.But dont get excited.It wont do the suit any good.The patch kit is a cone shaped valve with super sticky resin on the wide end.Its just too small to deal with a hole larger than eight centimeters.And really, if you have a nine centimeter hole, youre going to be dead way before you could whip out the kit.Still, its an asset, and maybe I can use it to stop the airlock leak.And thats my top priority right now.Its a small leak.With the faceplate gone, the EVA suit is effectively managing the whole airlock.Its been adding air to make up for the missing pressure.But itll run out eventually.I need to find the leak.I think its near my feet, judging by the sound.Now that Im out of the suit, I can turn around and get a look  I dont see anything I can hear it, but its down here somewhere, but I dont know where.I can only think of one way to find it: Start a fire!Yeah, I know.A lot of my ideas involve setting something on fire.And yes, deliberately starting a fire in a tiny, enclosed space is usually a terrible idea.But I need the smoke.Just a little wisp of it.As usual, Im working with stuff that was deliberately designed not to burn.But no amount of careful design by NASA can get around a determined arsonist with a tank of pure oxygen.Unfortunately, the EVA suit is made entirely of nonflammable materials.So is the airlock.My clothes are fireproof as well, even the thread.I was originally planning to check the solar array, doing repairs as needed after last nights storm.So I have my toolbox with me.But looking through it, I see its all metal or nonflammable plastic.I just realized I do have something flammable: my own hair.Itll have to do.Theres a sharp knife in the tool kit.Ill shave some arm hairs off into a little pile.Next step: oxygen.I dont have anything so refined as pure oxygen flow.All I can do is muck with the EVA suit controls to increase oxygen percentage in the whole airlock.I figure bumping it to 40 percent will do.All I need now is a spark.The EVA suit has electronics, but it runs on very low voltage.I dont think I could get an arc with it.Besides, I dont want to mess with the suit.I need it working to get from the airlock to the rover.The airlock itself has electronics, but it ran on Hab power.I guess NASA never considered what would happen if it was launched fifty meters.Lazy bums.Plastic might not burn, but anyone whos played with a balloon knows its great at building up static charge.Once I do that, I should be able to make a spark just by touching a metal tool.Fun fact: This is exactly how the Apollo 1 crew died.Wish me luck!AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (4)  Im in a box full of burning hair smell.Its not a good smell.On my first try, the fire lit, but the smoke just drifted randomly around.My own breathing was screwing it up.So I held my breath and tried again.My second try, the EVA suit threw everything off.Theres a gentle flow of air coming out of the faceplate as the suit constantly replaces the missing air.So I shut the suit down, held my breath, and tried again.I had to be quick; the pressure was dropping.My third try, the quick arm movements I used to set the fire messed everything up.Just moving around makes enough turbulence to send the smoke everywhere.The fourth time I kept the suit turned off, held my breath, and when the time came to light the fire, I did it very slowly.Then I watched as the little wisp of smoke drifted toward the floor of the airlock, disappearing through a hairline fracture.I have you now, little leak!I gasped for air and turned the EVA suit back on.The pressure had dropped to 0.9 atmospheres during my little experiment.But there was plenty of oxygen in the air for me and my hair fire to breathe.The suit quickly got things back to normal.Looking at the fracture, I see that its pretty tiny.It would be a cinch to seal it with the suits patch kit, but now that I think about it, thats a bad idea.Ill need to do some kind of repair to the faceplate.I dont know how just yet, but the patch kit and its pressure resistant resin are probably really important.And I cant do it bit by bit, either.Once I break the seal on the patch kit, the binary components of the resin mix and I have sixty seconds before it hardens.I cant just take a little to fix the airlock.Given time, I might be able to come up with a plan for the faceplate.Then, I could take a few seconds during that plan to scrape resin over the airlock fracture.But I dont have time.Im down to 40 percent of my N2 tank.I need to seal that fracture now, and I need to do it without using the patch kit.First idea: Little Dutch Boy.Im licking my palm and placing it over the crack.Okay I cant quite make a perfect seal, so theres airflow getting colder now getting pretty uncomfortable Okay, fuck this.On to idea number two.Tape!I have duct tape in my toolbox.Lets slap some on and see if it slows the flow.I wonder how long it will last before the pressure rips it.Putting it on now.There we go still holding  Lemme check the suit Readouts say the pressure is stable.Looks like the duct tape made a good seal.Lets see if it holds      AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (5)  Its been fifteen minutes, and the tape is still holding.Looks like that problem is solved.Sort of anticlimactic, really.I was already working out how to cover the breach with ice.I have two liters of water in the EVA suits hamster feeder.I could have shut off the suits heating systems and let the airlock cool to freezing.Then Id Well, whatever.Coulda done it with ice.Im just sayin.All right.On to my next problem: How do I fix the EVA suit?Duct tape might seal a hairline crack, but it cant hold an atmosphere of pressure against the size of my broken faceplate.The patch kit is too small, but still useful.I can spread the resin around the edge of where the faceplate was, then stick something on to cover the hole.Problem is, what do I use to cover the hole?Something that can stand up to a lot of pressure.Looking around, the only thing I see that can hold an atmosphere is the EVA suit itself.Theres plenty of material to work with, and I can even cut it.Remember when I was cutting Hab canvas into strips?Those same shears are right here in my tool kit.Cutting a chunk out of my EVA suit leaves it with another hole.But a hole I can control the shape and location of.Yeah I think I see a solution here.Im going to cut off my arm!Well, no.Not my arm.The EVA suits arm.Ill cut right below the left elbow.Then I can cut along its length, turning it into a rectangle.Itll be big enough to seal the faceplate, and itll be held in place by the resin.Material designed to withstand atmospheric pressure?Check.Resin designed to seal a breach against that pressure?Check.And what about the gaping hole on the stumpy arm?Unlike my faceplate, the suits material is flexible.Ill press it together and seal it with resin.Ill have to press my left arm against my side while Im in the suit, but therell be room.Ill be spreading the resin pretty thin, but its literally the strongest adhesive known to man.And it doesnt have to be a perfect seal.It just has to last long enough for me to get to safety.And where will that safety be?Not a damn clue.Anyway, one problem at a time.Right now Im fixing the EVA suit.AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (6)  Cutting the arm off the suit was easy; so was cutting along its length to make a rectangle.Those shears are strong as hell.Cleaning the glass off the faceplate took longer than Id expected.Its unlikely it would puncture EVA suit material, but Im not taking any chances.Besides, I dont want glass in my face when Im wearing it.Then came the tricky part.Once I broke the seal on the patch kit, I had sixty seconds before the resin set.I scooped it off the patch kit with my fingers and quickly spread it around the rim of the faceplate.Then I took what was left and sealed the arm hole.I pressed the rectangle of suit material onto the helmet with both hands while using my knee to keep pressure on the arms seam.I held on until Id counted 120 seconds.Just to be sure.It seemed to work well.The seal looked strong and the resin was rock hard.I did, however, glue my hand to the helmet.Stop laughing.In retrospect, using my fingers to spread the resin wasnt the best plan.Fortunately, my left hand was still free.After some grunting and a lot of profanities, I was able to reach the toolbox.Once I got a screwdriver, I chiseled myself free (feeling really stupid the whole time).It was a delicate process because I didnt want to flay the skin off my fingers.I had to get the screwdriver between the helmet and the resin.I freed my hand and didnt draw blood, so I call that a win.Though Ill have hardened resin on my fingers for days, just like a kid who played with Krazy Glue.Using the arm computer, I had the suit overpressurize to 1.2 atmospheres.The faceplate patch bowed outward but otherwise held firm.The arm filled in, threatening to tear the new seam, but stayed in one piece.Then I watched the readouts to see how airtight things were.Answer: Not very.It absolutely pissed the air out.In sixty seconds it leaked so much it pressurized the whole airlock to 1.2 atmospheres.The suit is designed for eight hours of use.That works out to 250 milliliters of liquid oxygen.Just to be safe, the suit has a full liter of O2 capacity.But thats only half the story.The rest of the air is nitrogen.Its just there to add pressure.When the suit leaks, thats what it backfills with.The suit has two liters of liquid N2 storage.Lets call the volume of the airlock two cubic meters.The inflated EVA suit probably takes up half of it.So it took five minutes to add 0.2 atmospheres to 1 cubic meter.Thats 285 grams of air (trust me on the math).The air in the tanks is around 1 gram per cubic centimeter, meaning I just lost 285 milliliters.The three tanks combined had 3000 milliliters to start with.A lot of that was used to maintain pressure while the airlock was leaking.Also, my breathing turned some oxygen into carbon dioxide, which was captured by the suits CO2 filters.Checking the readouts, I see that I have 410 milliliters of oxygen, 738 milliliters of nitrogen.Together, they make almost 1150 milliliters to work with.That, divided by 285 milliliters lost per minute  Once Im out of the airlock, this EVA suit will only last four minutes.Fuck.AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (7)  Okay, Ive been thinking some more.What good is going to the rover?Id just be trapped there instead.The extra room would be nice, but Id still die eventually.No water reclaimer, no oxygenator, no food.Take your pick; all of those problems are fatal.I need to fix the Hab.I know what to do; we practiced it in training.But itll take a long time.Ill have to scrounge around in the now collapsed canvas to get the spare material for patching.Then I have to find the breach and seal strip a patch in place.But itll take hours to repair, and my EVA suit is useless.Ill need another suit.Martinezs used to be in the rover.I hauled it all the way to the Pathfinder site and back, just in case I needed a spare.But when I returned, I put it back in the Hab.Damn it!All right, so Ill need to get another suit before going to the rover.Which one?Johanssens is too small for me (tiny little gal, our Johanssen).Lewiss is full of water.Actually, by now its full of slowly sublimating ice.The mangled, glued together suit I have with me is my original one.That leaves just Martinez, Vogel, and Becks.I left Martinezs near my bunk, in case I needed a suit in a hurry.Of course, after that sudden decompression, it could be anywhere.Still, its a place to start.Next problem: Im like 50 meters from the Hab.Running in 0.4 g while wearing a bulky EVA suit isnt easy.At best, I can trundle 2 meters per second.Thats a precious 25 seconds; almost an eighth of my four minutes.Ive got to bring that down.But how?AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (8)  Ill roll the damn airlock.Its basically a phone booth on its side.I did some experiments.I figured if I want it to roll, Ill need to hit the wall as hard as possible.And I have to be in the air at the time.I cant press against some other part of the airlock.The forces would cancel each other out and it wouldnt move at all.First I tried launching myself off one wall and slamming into the other.The airlock slid a little, but thats it.Next, I tried doing a super push up to get airborne (0.4 g yay!)then kicking the wall with both feet.Again, it just slid.The third time, I got it right.The trick was to plant both my feet on the ground, near the wall, then launch myself to the top of the opposite wall and hit with my back.When I tried that just now, it gave me enough force and leverage to tip the airlock and roll it one face toward the Hab.The airlock is a meter wide, so sigh I have to do it like fifty more times.Im gonna have a hell of a backache after this.AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 120  I have a hell of a backache.The subtle and refined hurl my body at the wall technique had some flaws.It worked only one out of every ten tries, and it hurt a lot.I had to take breaks, stretch out, and generally convince myself to body slam the wall again and again.It took all damn night, but I made it.Im ten meters from the Hab now.I cant get any closer, cause the debris from the decompression is all over the place.This isnt an all terrain airlock.I cant roll over that shit.It was morning when the Hab popped.Now its morning again.Ive been in this damn box for an entire day.But Im leaving soon.Im in the EVA suit now, and ready to roll.All right Okay Once more through the plan: Use the manual valves to equalize the airlock.Get out and hurry to the Hab.Wander around under the collapsed canvas.Find Martinezs suit (or Vogels if I run into it first).Get to the rover.Then Im safe.If I run out of time before finding a suit, Ill just run to the rover.Ill be in trouble, but Ill have time to think and materials to work with.Deep breath here we go!LOG ENTRY: SOL 120  Im alive!And Im in the rover!Things didnt go exactly as planned, but Im not dead, so its a win.Equalizing the airlock went fine.I was out on the surface within thirty seconds.Skipping toward the Hab (the fastest way to move in this gravity), I passed through the field of debris.The rupture had really sent things flying, myself included.It was hard to see; my faceplate was covered by the makeshift patch.Fortunately, my arm had a camera.NASA discovered that turning your whole EVA suited body to look at something was a strenuous waste of time.So they mounted a small camera on the right arm.The feed is projected on the inner faceplate.This allows us to look at things just by pointing at them.The faceplate patch wasnt exactly smooth or reflective, so I had to look at a rippled, messed up version of the camera feed.Still, it was enough to see what was going on.I beelined for where the airlock used to be.I knew there had to be a pretty big hole there, so Id be able to get in.I found it easily.And boy is it a nasty rip!Its going to be a pain in the ass to fix it.Thats when the flaws in my plan started to reveal themselves.I only had one arm to work with.My left arm was pinned against my body, while the stumpy arm of the suit bounced freely.So as I moved around under the canvas, I had to use my one good arm to hold the canvas up.It slowed me down.From what I could see, the interior of the Hab is chaos.Everythings moved.Entire tables and bunks are meters away from where they started.Lighter objects are wildly jumbled, many of them out on the surface.Everythings covered in soil and mangled potato plants.Trudging onward, I got to where Id left Martinezs suit.To my shock, it was still there!Yay!I naively thought.Problem solved.Unfortunately, the suit was pinned under a table, which was held down by the collapsed canvas.If Id had both arms, I could have pulled it free, but with only one, I just couldnt do it.Running low on time, I detached the helmet.Setting it aside, I reached past the table to get Martinezs patch kit.I found it with the help of the arm camera.I dropped it in the helmet and hauled ass out of there.I barely made it to the rover in time.My ears were popping from pressure loss just as the rovers airlock filled with wonderful 1 atmosphere air.Crawling in, I collapsed and panted for a moment.So Im back in the rover.Just like I was back on the Great Pathfinder Recovery Expedition.Ugh.At least this time it smells a little better.NASAs probably pretty worried about me by now.They probably saw the airlock move back to the Hab, so they know Im alive, but theyll want status.And as it happens, its the rover that communicates with Pathfinder.I tried to send a message, but Pathfinder isnt responding.Thats not a big surprise.Its powered directly from the Hab, and the Hab is offline.During my brief, panicked scramble outside, I saw that Pathfinder was right where I left it, and the debris didnt reach that far out.It should be fine, once I get it some power.As for my current situation, the big gain is the helmet.Theyre interchangeable, so I can replace my broken ass one with Martinezs.The stumpy arm is still an issue, but the faceplate was the main source of leaks.And with the fresh patch kit, I can seal the arm with more resin.But that can wait.Ive been awake for over twenty four hours.Im not in any immediate danger, so Im going to sleep.LOG ENTRY: SOL 121  Got a good nights sleep and made real progress today.First thing I did was reseal the arm.Last time, I had to spread the resin pretty thin; Id used most of it for the faceplate patch.But this time I had a whole patch kit just for the arm.I got a perfect seal.I still only had a one armed suit, but at least it didnt leak.Id lost most of my air yesterday, but I had a half hour of oxygen left.Like I said earlier, a human body doesnt need much oxygen.Maintaining pressure was the problem.With that much time, I was able to take advantage of the rovers EVA tank refill.Something I couldnt do with the leaky suit.The tank refill is an emergency measure.The expected use of the rover is to start with full EVA suits and come back with air to spare.It wasnt designed for long trips, or even overnighters.But, just in case of emergency, it has refill hoses mounted on the exterior.Inside space was limited already, and NASA concluded that most air related emergencies would be outdoors.But refilling is slow, slower than my suit was leaking.So it wasnt any use to me until I swapped helmets.Now, with a solid suit capable of holding pressure, refilling the tanks was a breeze.After refilling, and making sure the suit was still not leaking, I had a few immediate tasks to take care of.Much as I trust my handiwork, I wanted a two armed suit.I ventured back into the Hab.This time, not being rushed, I was able to use a pole to leverage the table off Martinezs suit.Pulling it loose, I dragged it back to the rover.After a thorough diagnostic to be sure, I finally had a fully functional EVA suit!It took me two trips to get it, but I got it.Tomorrow, Ill fix the Hab.LOG ENTRY: SOL 122  The first thing I did today was line up rocks near the rover to spell A okay.That should make NASA happy.I went into the Hab again to assess damage.My priority will be to get the structure intact and holding pressure.From there, I can work on fixing stuff that broke.The Hab is normally a dome, with flexible support poles maintaining the arch and rigid, folding floor material to keep its base flat.The internal pressure was a vital part of its support.Without it, the whole thing collapsed.I inspected the poles, and none of them had broken.Theyre just lying flat is all.Ill have to re couple a few of them, but thatll be easy.The hole where Airlock 1 used to be is huge, but surmountable.I have seal strips and spare canvas.Itll be a lot of work, but I can get the Hab together again.Once I do, Ill reestablish power and get Pathfinder back online.From there, NASA can tell me how to fix anything I cant figure out on my own.Im not worried about any of that.I have a much bigger problem.The farm is dead.With a complete loss of pressure, most of the water boiled off.Also, the temperature is well below freezing.Not even the bacteria in the soil can survive a catastrophe like that.Some of the crops were in pop tents off the Hab.But theyre dead, too.I had them connected directly to the Hab via hoses to maintain air supply and temperature.When the Hab blew, the pop tents depressurized as well.Even if they hadnt, the freezing cold would have killed the crops.Potatoes are now extinct on Mars.So is the soil bacteria.Ill never grow another plant so long as Im here.We had it all planned out.My farm would give me food till Sol 900.A supply probe would get here on Sol 856; way before I ran out.With the farm dead, that plan is history.The ration packs wont have been affected by the explosion.And the potatoes Ive already grown may be dead, but theyre still food.I was just about to harvest, so it was a good time for this to happen, I guess.The rations will last me till Sol 400.I cant say for sure how long the potatoes will last, until I see how many I got.But I can estimate.I had 400 plants, probably averaging 5 potatoes each: 2000 taters.At 150 calories each, Ill need to eat 10 per sol to survive.That means theyll last me 200 sols.Grand total: I have enough food to last till Sol 600.By Sol 856 Ill be long dead.Chapter 15   [08:12] WATNEY: Test.[08:25] JPL: Received!You gave us quite a scare there.Thanks for the A okay message.Our analysis of satellite imagery shows a complete detachment of Airlock 1.Is that correct?Whats your status?[08:39] WATNEY: If by detachment you mean shot me out like a cannon then yeah.Minor cut on my forehead.Had some issues with my EVA suit (Ill explain later).I patched up the Hab and repressurized it (main air tanks were intact).I just got power back online.The farm is dead.Ive recovered as many potatoes as I could and stored them outside.I count 1841.That will last me 184 days.Including the remaining mission rations, Ill start starving on Sol 584.[08:52] JPL: Yeah, we figured.Were working on solutions to the food issue.Whats the status of the Hab systems?[09:05] WATNEY: Primary air and water tanks were unharmed.The rover, solar array, and Pathfinder were out of the blast range.Ill run diagnostics on the Habs systems while I wait for your next reply.By the way, who am I talking to?[09:18] JPL: Venkat Kapoor in Houston.Pasadena relays my messages.Im going to handle all direct communication with you from now on.Check the oxygenator and water reclaimer first.Theyre the most important.[09:31] WATNEY: Duh.Oxygenator functioning perfectly.Water reclaimer is completely offline.Best guess is water froze up inside and burst some tubing.Im sure I can fix it.The Habs main computer is also functioning without any problems.Any idea what caused the Hab to blow up?[09:44] JPL: Best guess is fatigue on the canvas near Airlock 1.The pressurization cycle stressed it until it failed.From now on, alternate Airlock 2 and 3 for all EVAs.Also, well be getting you a checklist and procedures for a full canvas exam.[09:57] WATNEY: Yay, I get to stare at a wall for several hours!Let me know if you come up with a way for me to not starve.[10:11] JPL: Will do.*  Its Sol 122, Bruce said.We have until Sol 584 to get a probe to Mars.Thats four hundred and sixty two sols, which is four hundred and seventy five days.The assembled department heads of JPL furrowed their brows and rubbed their eyes.He stood from his chair.The positions of Earth and Mars arent ideal.The trip will take four hundred and fourteen days.Mounting the probe to the booster and dealing with inspections will take thirteen days.That leaves us with just forty eight days to make this probe.Sounds of whispered exasperation filled the room.Jesus, someone said.Its a whole new ball game, Bruce continued.Our focus is food.Anything else is a luxury.We dont have time to make a powered descent lander.Itll have to be a tumbler.So we cant put anything delicate inside.Say good bye to all the other crap wed planned to send.Wheres the booster coming from?asked Norm Toshi, who was in charge of the reentry process.The EagleEye 3 Saturn probe, Bruce said.It was scheduled to launch next month.NASA put it on hold so we can have the booster.I bet the EagleEye team was pissed about that, Norm said.Im sure they were, Bruce said.But its the only booster we have thats big enough.Which brings me to my next point: We only get one shot at this.If we fail, Mark Watney dies.He looked around the room and let that sink in.We do have some things going for us, he finally said.We have some of the parts built for the Ares 4 presupply missions.We can steal from them, and thatll save us some time.Also, were sending food, which is pretty robust.Even if theres a reentry problem and the probe impacts at high velocity, food is still food.And we dont need a precision landing.Watney can travel hundreds of kilometers if necessary.We just need to land close enough for him to reach it.This ends up being a standard tumble land presupply.All we have to do is make it quickly.So lets get to it.*  [08:02] JPL: Weve spun up a project to get you food.Its been in progress for a week or so.We can get it to you before you starve, but itll be tight.Itll just be food and a radio.We cant send an oxygenator, water reclaimer, or any of that other stuff without powered descent.[08:16] WATNEY: No complaints here!You get me the food, Ill be a happy camper.Ive got all Hab systems up and running again.The water reclaimer is working fine now that I replaced the burst hoses.As for water supply, I have 620 liters remaining.I started with 900 liters (300 to start with, 600 more from reducing hydrazine).So I lost almost 300 liters to sublimation.Still, with the water reclaimer operational again, its plenty.[08:31] JPL: Good, keep us posted on any mechanical or electronic problems.By the way, the name of the probe were sending is Iris.Named after the Greek goddess who traveled the heavens with the speed of wind.Shes also the goddess of rainbows.[08:47] WATNEY: Gay probe coming to save me.Got it.*  Rich Purnell sipped coffee in the silent building.He ran a final test on the software hed written.It passed.With a relieved sigh, he sank back in his chair.Checking the clock on his computer, he shook his head.3:42 a. m.   As an astrodynamicist, Rich rarely had to work late.His job was to find the exact orbits and course corrections needed for any given mission.Usually, it was one of the first parts of a project, all the other steps being based on the orbit.But this time, things were reversed.Iris needed an orbital path, and nobody knew when it would launch.Planets move as time goes by.A course calculated for a specific launch date will work only for that date.Even a single days difference would result in missing Mars entirely.So Rich had to calculate many courses.He had a range of twenty five days during which Iris might launch.He calculated one course for each.He began an e mail to his boss.Mike, he typed, Attached are the courses for Iris, in 1 day increments.We should start peer review and vetting so they can be officially accepted.And you were right, I was here almost all night.It wasnt that bad.Nowhere near the pain of calculating orbits for Hermes.I know you get bored when I go into the math, so Ill summarize: The small, constant thrust of Hermess ion drives is much harder to deal with than the large point thrusts of presupply probes.All 25 of the courses take 414 days, and vary only slightly in thrust duration and angle.The fuel requirement is nearly identical for the orbits and is well within the capacity of EagleEyes booster.Its too bad.Earth and Mars are really badly positioned.Heck, its almost easier to  He stopped typing.Furrowing his brow, he stared into the distance.Hmm, he said.He grabbed his coffee cup and went to the break room for a refill.*  Teddy scanned the crowded conference room.It was rare to see such an assembly of NASAs most important people all in one place.He squared a small stack of notes hed prepared and placed them neatly in front of him.I know youre all busy, Teddy said.Thank you for making time for this meeting.I need status on Project Iris from all departments.Venkat, lets start with you.The mission teams ready, Venkat said, looking at spreadsheets on his laptop.There was a minor turf war between the Ares 3 and Ares 4 presupply control teams.The Ares 3 guys said they should run it, because while Watneys on Mars, Ares 3 is still in progress.The Ares 4 team points out its their coopted probe in the first place.I ended up going with Ares 3.Did that upset Ares 4?Teddy asked.Yes, but theyll get over it.They have thirteen other presupply missions coming up.They wont have time to be pissy.Mitch, Teddy said to the flight controller, what about the launch?Mitch pulled the earpiece from his ear.Weve got a control room ready, he said.Ill oversee the launch, then hand cruise and landing over to Venkats guys.Media?Teddy said, turning to Annie.Im giving daily updates to the press, she said, leaning back in her chair.Everyone knows Watneys fucked if this doesnt work.The public hasnt been this engaged in ship construction since Apollo 11.CNNs The Watney Report has been the number one show in its time slot for the past two weeks.The attention is good, Teddy said.Itll help get us emergency funding from Congress.He looked up to a man standing near the entrance.Maurice, thanks for flying out on short notice.Maurice nodded.Teddy gestured to him and addressed the room.For those who dont know him, this is Maurice Stein from Cape Canaveral.He was the scheduled pad leader for EagleEye 3, so he inherited the role for Iris.Sorry for the bait and switch, Maurice.No problem, said Maurice.Glad I can help out.Teddy flipped the top page of his notes facedown beside the stack.Hows the booster?Its all right for now, said Maurice.But its not ideal.EagleEye 3 was set to launch.Boosters arent designed to stand upright and bear the stress of gravity for long periods.Were adding external supports that well remove before launch.Its easier than disassembly.Also the fuel is corrosive to the internal tanks, so we had to drain it.In the meantime, were performing inspections on all systems every three days.Good, thank you, Teddy said.He turned his attention to Bruce Ng, who stared back at him with heavy bloodshot eyes.Bruce, thank you for flying out, too.Hows the weather in California these days?I wouldnt know, Bruce said.I rarely see the outdoors.Subdued laughter filled the room for a few seconds.Teddy flipped another page.Time for the big question, Bruce.Hows Iris coming along?Were behind, Bruce said with a tired shake of his head.Were going as fast as we can, but its just not fast enough.I can find money for overtime, Teddy offered.Were already working around the clock.How far behind are we talking about?Teddy asked.Bruce rubbed his eyes and sighed.Weve been at it twenty nine days; so we only have nineteen left.After that, the Pad needs thirteen days to mount it on the booster.Were at least two weeks behind.Is that as far behind as youre going to get?Teddy asked, writing a note on his papers.Or will you slip more?Bruce shrugged.If we dont have any more problems, itll be two weeks late.But we always have problems.Give me a number, Teddy said.Fifteen days, Bruce responded.If we had another fifteen days, Im sure we could get it done in time.All right, Teddy said, taking another note.Lets create fifteen days.Turning his attention to the Ares 3 flight surgeon, Teddy asked, Dr.Keller, can we reduce Watneys food intake to make the rations last longer?Sorry, but no, Keller said.Hes already at a minimal calorie count.In fact, considering the amount of physical labor he does, hes eating far less than he should.And its only going to get worse.Soon his entire diet will be potatoes and vitamin supplements.Hes been saving protein rich rations for later use, but hell still be malnourished.Once he runs out of food, how long until he starves to death?Teddy asked.Presuming an ample water supply, he might last three weeks.Shorter than a typical hunger strike, but remember hell be malnourished and thin to begin with.Venkat raised a hand and caught their attention.Remember, Iris is a tumbler; he might have to drive a few days to get it.And Im guessing its hard to control a rover when youre literally starving to death.Hes right, Dr.Keller confirmed.Within four days of running out of food, hell barely be able to stand up, let alone control a rover.Plus, his mental faculties will rapidly decline.Hed have a hard time even staying awake.So the landing dates firm, Teddy said.Maurice, can you get Iris on the booster in less than thirteen days?Maurice leaned against the wall and pinched his chin.Well it only takes three days to actually mount it.The following ten are for testing and inspections.How much can you reduce those?With enough overtime, I could get the mounting down to two days.That includes transport from Pasadena to Cape Canaveral.But the inspections cant be shortened.Theyre time based.We do checks and rechecks with set intervals between them to see if something deforms or warps.If you shorten the intervals, you invalidate the inspections.How often do those inspections reveal a problem?Teddy asked.A silence fell over the room.Uh, Maurice stammered.Are you suggesting we dont do the inspections?No, said Teddy.Right now Im asking how often they reveal a problem.About one in twenty launches.Teddy wrote that down.And how often is the problem they find something that would have caused a mission failure?Im, uh, not sure.Maybe half the time?He wrote that down as well.So if we skip inspections and testing, we have a one in forty chance of mission failure?Teddy asked.Thats two point five percent, Venkat said, stepping in.Normally, thats grounds for a countdown halt.We cant take a chance like that.Normally was a long time ago, Teddy said.Ninety seven point five percent is better than zero.Can anyone think of a safer way to get more time?He scanned the room.Blank faces stared back.All right, then, he said, circling something on his notes.Speeding up the mounting process and skipping inspections buys us eleven days.If Bruce can pull a rabbit out of a hat and get done sooner, Maurice can do some inspections.What about the other four days?Venkat asked.Im sure Watney can stretch the food to last four extra days, malnutrition notwithstanding, Teddy said, looking to Dr.Keller.I Keller started.I cant recommend  Hang on, Teddy interrupted.He stood and straightened his blazer.Everyone, I understand your positions.We have procedures.Skipping those procedures means risk.Risk means trouble for your department.But now isnt the time to cover our asses.We have to take risks or Mark Watney dies.Turning to Keller, he said, Make the food last another four days.Keller nodded.*  Rich, said Mike.Rich Purnell concentrated on his computer screen.His cubicle was a landfill of printouts, charts, and reference books.Empty coffee cups rested on every surface; take out packaging littered the ground.Rich, Mike said, more forcefully.Rich looked up.Yeah?What the hell are you doing?Just a little side project.Something I wanted to check up on.Well thats fine, I guess, Mike said, but you need to do your assigned work first.I asked for those satellite adjustments two weeks ago and you still havent done them.I need some supercomputer time, Rich said.You need supercomputer time to calculate routine satellite adjustments?No, its for this other thing Im working on, Rich said.Rich, seriously.You have to do your job.Rich thought for a moment.Would now be a good time for a vacation?he asked.Mike sighed.You know what, Rich?I think now would be an ideal time for you to take a vacation.Great!Rich smiled.Ill start right now.Sure, Mike said.Go on home.Get some rest.Oh, Im not going home, said Rich, returning to his calculations.Mike rubbed his eyes.Okay, whatever.About those satellite orbits?Im on vacation, Rich said without looking up.Mike shrugged and walked away.*  [08:01] WATNEY: Hows my care package coming along?[08:16] JPL: A little behind schedule, but well get it done.In the meantime, we want you to get back to work.Were satisfied the Hab is in good condition.Maintenance only takes you twelve hours per week.Were going to pack the rest of your time with research and experiments.[08:31] WATNEY: Great!Im sick of sitting on my ass.Im going to be here for years.You may as well make use of me.[08:47] JPL: Thats what were thinking.Well get you a schedule as soon as the science team puts it together.Itll be mostly EVAs, geological sampling, soil tests, and weekly self administered medical tests.Honestly, this is the best bonus Mars time weve had since the Opportunity lander.[09:02] WATNEY: Opportunity never went back to Earth.[09:17] JPL: Sorry.Bad analogy.*  The JPL Spacecraft Assembly Facility, known as the clean room, was the little known birthplace of the most famous spacecraft in Mars exploration history.Mariner, Viking, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity, just to name a few, had all been born in this one room.Today, the room was abuzz with activity as technicians sealed Iris into the specially designed shipping container.The off duty techs watched the procedure from the observation deck.They had rarely seen their homes in the last two months; a makeshift bunk room had been set up in the cafeteria.Fully a third of them would normally be asleep at this hour, but they did not want to miss this moment.The shift leader tightened the final bolt.As he retracted the wrench, the engineers broke into applause.Many of them were in tears.After sixty three days of grueling work, Iris was complete.*  Annie took the podium and adjusted the microphone.The launch preparations are complete, she said.Iris is ready to go.The scheduled launch is 9:14 a. m.   Once launched, it will stay in orbit for at least three hours.During that time, Mission Control will gather exact telemetry in preparation for the trans Mars injection burn.When thats complete, the mission will be handed off to the Ares 3 presupply team, who will monitor its progress over the following months.It will take four hundred and fourteen days to reach Mars.About the payload, a reporter asked, I hear theres more than just food?Thats true.Annie smiled.We allocated one hundred grams for luxury items.There are some handwritten letters from Marks family, a note from the President, and a USB drive filled with music from all ages.Any disco?someone asked.No disco, Annie said, as chuckles cascaded through the room.CNNs Cathy Warner spoke up.If this launch fails, is there any recourse for Watney?There are risks to any launch, Annie said, sidestepping the question, but we dont anticipate problems.The weather at the Cape is clear with warm temperatures.Conditions couldnt be better.Is there any spending limit to this rescue operation?another reporter asked.Some people are beginning to ask how much is too much.Its not about the bottom line, Annie said, prepared for the question.Its about a human life in immediate danger.But if you want to look at it financially, consider the value of Mark Watneys extended mission.His prolonged mission and fight for survival are giving us more knowledge about Mars than the rest of the Ares program combined.*  Do you believe in God, Venkat?Mitch asked.Sure, lots of em, Venkat said.Im Hindu.Ask em all for help with this launch.Will do.Mitch stepped forward to his station in Mission Control.The room bustled with activity as the dozens of controllers each made final preparations for launch.He put his headset on and glanced at the time readout on the giant center screen at the front of the room.He turned on his headset and said, This is the flight director.Begin launch status check.Roger that, Houston was the reply from the launch control director in Florida.CLCDR checking all stations are manned and systems ready, he broadcast.Give me a go/no go for launch.Talker?Go was the response.Timer.Go, said another voice.QAM1.Go.Resting his chin on his hands, Mitch stared at the center screen.It showed the pad video feed.The booster, amid cloudy water vapor from the cooling process, still had EagleEye3 stenciled on the side.QAM2.Go.QAM3.Go.Venkat leaned against the back wall.He was an administrator.His job was done.He could only watch and hope.His gaze was fixated on the far walls displays.In his mind, he saw the numbers, the shift juggling, the outright lies and borderline crimes hed committed to put this mission together.It would all be worthwhile, if it worked.FSC.Go.Prop One.Go.Teddy sat in the VIP observation room behind Mission Control.His authority afforded him the very best seat: front row center.His briefcase lay at his feet and he held a blue folder in his hands.Prop Two.Go.PTO.Go.Annie Montrose paced in her private office next to the press room.Nine televisions mounted to the wall were each tuned to a different network; each network showed the launch pad.A glance at her computer showed foreign networks doing the same.The world was holding its breath.ACC.Go.LWO.Go.Bruce Ng sat in the JPL cafeteria along with hundreds of engineers who had given everything they had to Iris.They watched the live feed on a projection screen.Some fidgeted, unable to find comfortable positions.Others held hands.It was 6:13 a. m.  in Pasadena, yet every single employee was present.AFLC.Go.Guidance.Go.Millions of kilometers away, the crew of Hermes listened as they crowded around Johanssens station.The two minute transmission time didnt matter.They had no way to help; there was no need to interact.Johanssen stared intently at her screen, although it displayed only the audio signal strength.Beck wrung his hands.Vogel stood motionless, his eyes fixed on the floor.Martinez prayed silently at first, then saw no reason to hide it.Commander Lewis stood apart, her arms folded across her chest.PTC.Go.Launch Vehicle Director.Go.Houston, this is Launch Control, we are go for launch.Roger, Mitch said, checking the countdown.This is Flight, we are go for launch on schedule.Roger that, Houston, Launch Control said.Launch on schedule.Once the clock reached 00:00:15, the television networks got what they were waiting for.The timer controller began the verbal countdown.Fifteen, she said, fourteen thirteen twelve eleven  Thousands had gathered at Cape Canaveral, the largest crowd ever to watch an unmanned launch.They listened to the timer controllers voice as it echoed across the grandstands.ten nine eight seven  Rich Purnell, entrenched in his orbital calculations, had lost track of time.He didnt notice when his coworkers migrated to the large meeting room where a TV had been set up.In the back of his mind, he thought the office was unusually quiet, but he gave it no further thought.six five four  Ignition sequence start.three two one  Clamps released, the booster rose amid a plume of smoke and fire, slowly at first, then racing ever faster.The assembled crowd cheered it on its way.and liftoff of the Iris supply probe, the timer controller said.As the booster soared, Mitch had no time to watch the spectacle on the main screen.Trim?he called out.Trims good, Flight was the immediate response.Course?he asked.On course.Altitude one thousand meters, someone said.Weve reached safe abort, another person called out, indicating that the ship could crash harmlessly into the Atlantic Ocean if necessary.Altitude fifteen hundred meters.Pitch and roll maneuver commencing.Getting a little shimmy, Flight.Mitch looked over to the ascent flight director.Say again?A slight shimmy.Onboard guidance is handling it.Keep an eye on it, Mitch said.Altitude twenty five hundred meters.Pitch and roll complete, twenty two seconds till staging.*  When designing Iris, JPL accounted for catastrophic landing failure.Rather than normal meal kits, most of the food was cubed protein bar material, which would still be edible even if Iris failed to deploy its tumble balloons and impacted at incredible speed.Because Iris was an unmanned mission, there was no cap on acceleration.The contents of the probe endured forces no human could survive.But while NASA had tested the effects of extreme g forces on protein cubes, they had not done so with a simultaneous lateral vibration.Had they been given more time, they would have.The harmless shimmy, caused by a minor fuel mixture imbalance, rattled the payload.Iris, mounted firmly within the aeroshell atop the booster, held firm.The protein cubes inside Iris did not.At the microscopic level, the protein cubes were solid food particles suspended in thick vegetable oil.
