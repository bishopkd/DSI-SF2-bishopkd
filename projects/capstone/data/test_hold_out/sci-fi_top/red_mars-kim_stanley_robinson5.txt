But at that point it could have been falling for quite some time.Boone slowly walked around into the gap between the shaft wall and the pile of scrap.The truck had landed on its right side, and the left side was deformed but recognizable.Okakura climbed several steps up the wreckage, then pointed at a black area behind the left front tire.John followed him up, scraped at the metal with the claw on his right gloves forefinger.The black came away like soot.Ammonium nitrate explosion.The body of the truck was bent in there as if hammered.A good sized charge, John observed.Yes, Okakura said, and cleared his throat.He was frightened, that was sure.Well, the first man on Mars had almost been killed while in his care; and himself too, of course, but who knew which would scare him more?Enough to push truck off road.Well, like I said, theres been some sabotage reported.Okakura was frowning through his faceplate.But who?And why?I dont know.Anyone in your team seem to be having any psychological difficulties?No.Okakuras face was carefully blank.Every group larger than five had someone experiencing difficulties, and Okakuras little industrial town had a population of 500.This is the sixth case Ive seen, John said.Although none so close up.He laughed.The image of the birdlike dot in the pink sky came back to him.It would have been easy for someone to attach a bomb to a truck before it came down.Detonate it with a clock or an altimeter.Reds, you mean.Okakura was looking relieved.We have heard of them.But it is ...He shrugged.Crazy.Yes.John climbed gingerly off the wreck.They walked back across the floor of the shaft to the car they had come down in.Okakura was on another band, talking to people up top.John stopped by the central pit to have a final look around.The sheer size of the shaft was hard to grasp; the muted light and vertical lines reminded him of a cathedral, but all the cathedrals ever built would have sat like dollhouses at the bottom of this great hole.The surreal scale made him blink, and he decided he had tilted his head back too long.They drove up the road inscribed in the side wall to the first elevator, left the car and got in the cage.Up they went.Seven times they had to get out and walk across the wall road to the bottom of the next elevator.The ambient light grew to something more like ordinary daylight.Across the shaft he could see where the wall was scored by the double spiral of the two roads: thread marks in an enormous screw hole.The shafts bottom had disappeared into the murk, he couldnt even make out the truck.In the last two elevators they ascended through regolith; first the megaregolith, which looked like cracked bedrock, and then the regolith proper, its rock and gravel and ice all hidden behind a concrete retainer, a smooth curved wall that looked like a dam, and was angled so far back that the final elevator was actually a cog rail train.They cranked up the side of this enormous funnel Big Mans bathtub drain, Okakura had said on the way down and came finally to the surface, out into the sun.Boone got out of the cog train and looked back down.The regolith retainer looked like the inner wall of a very smooth crater, with a two laned road spiraling down it, but the crater had no floor.A mohole.He could see down the shaft a little way, but the wall was in shadow, and only the road spiraling down picked up any light, so that it appeared to be something like a freestanding staircase, descending through empty space to the planets core.Three of the giant dump trucks ground slowly up the last stretch of the road, full of black boulders.These days it took them five hours to make the trip from the bottom of the shaft, Okakura said.Very little supervision, like most of the project, in both manufacture and operation.The inhabitants of the town only had to see to programming, deployment, maintenance, and troubleshooting.And, now, security.The town, called Senzeni Na, was scattered over the floor of Thaumasia Fossaes deepest canyon.Nearest to the hole was the industrial park; here most of the excavation equipment was manufactured, and the rock from the hole processed for its trace amounts of valuable metals.Boone and Okakura stepped into the rim station, changed out of their pressure suits into coppery jumpers, and entered one of the clear walktubes that connected all the buildings in the town.It was cold and sunny in the tubes, and everyone in them wore clothing with an outer layer of copper colored foil, the latest in Japanese radproofing.Copper creatures, moving in clear tubes; it looked to Boone like a giant ant farm.Overhead the thermal cloud frosted into existence and shot up like steam from a valve, until it was caught by high winds and blown out in a long flattened contrail.The towns actual living quarters were built into the southeast wall of the canyon.A big rectangular section of the cliff had been replaced by glass; behind it was a tall open concourse, backed by five stories of terraced apartments.They walked through the concourse and Okakura led him up to the town offices, on the fifth floor.A small crowd of concerned looking people gathered in their wake, chattering to Okakura and among themselves.They all went through the office and out onto its balcony.John watched closely as Okakura described in Japanese what had happened.A number of his audience looked nervous, and most would not meet Johns eye.Had the near accident itself been enough to incur giri?It was important to make sure they didnt feel publicly shown up, or anything like it.Shame was strong stuff for the Japanese, and Okakura was beginning to look desperately unhappy, as if he were deciding it had been his fault.Look, it could just as easily have been outsiders as someone from here, John said boldly.He made some suggestions for future security.The rim is a perfect barrier.Set up an alarm system, and a few people at the rim station could keep an eye on both the system and the elevators.A waste of time, but I guess we have to do it.Diffidently Okakura asked him if he knew anything about who might be responsible for the sabotage.He shrugged.No idea, sorry.People opposed to the moholes, I guess.But the moholes are dug, one of them said.I know.I guess its symbolic.He grinned.But if a truck falls on someone, it would be a bad symbol.They nodded seriously.He wished he had Franks facility for languages it would help to be able to communicate better with these people.They were hard to read; inscrutable and all that.They wondered if he wanted to lie down.Im okay, he said.It missed us.Well have to look into it, but today lets just continue according to the schedule we had.So Okakura and several men and women led him on a tour of the town, and cheerfully he visited labs and meeting rooms, lounges and dining halls.He nodded and shook hands and said Hi until he was sure he had met over fifty percent of Senzeni Nas inhabitants.Most had not yet heard of the incident in the hole, and all were pleased to meet him, happy to shake his hand, to speak with him, to show him something, to look at him.It happened everywhere he went, reminding him unpleasantly of the fishbowl years between his first trip and his second.But he did his job.An hours work, then four hours of being The First Man On Mars: the usual ratio.And as afternoon darkened to evening, and the whole town gathered for a banquet in honor of his visit, he settled back and patiently played his part.That meant shifting into a good mood, no easy task that night.In fact he took a break and went back to the bathroom in his room to swallow a capsule manufactured by Vlads medical group in Acheron.It was a drug they had named omegendorph, a synthetic mix of all the endorphins and opiates they had found in the brains natural chemistry, and a better feel good drug than Boone would have imagined possible.He returned to the banquet much more relaxed.In fact filled with a little glow.He had escaped death, after all, and by running like a wild man!Some more endorphins were not inappropriate.He moved easily from table to table, asking questions as he went.This was what pleased people, what gave them the festival feeling that a meeting with John Boone should bring.John liked being able to do that, it was the part of his job that made celebrity tolerable; because when he asked questions, people leaped to answer like salmon in the stream.It was peculiar, really, as if people were seeking to right the imbalance they felt in the situation, in which they knew so much about him while he knew so little about them.So that with the right encouragement, often a single carefully judged prompt, they would erupt with the most astonishing spills of personal information: witnessing, testifying, confessing.So he spent the evening learning about life at Senzeni Na.(Means, what have we done?Quick grin. )And afterward he was led to his big guest suite, the rooms thick with live bamboo, the bed seemingly hacked out of a stand of it.When he was alone he connected his code box to the phone, and called Sax Russell.Russell was at Vlads new headquarters, a research complex built into a dramatic fin ridge in the Acheron Fossae north of Olympus Mons.Sax spent all his time there now, studying genetic engineering like an undergrad; he had become convinced that biotechnology was the key to terraforming, and he was determined to educate himself to the point where he could contribute actively to that part of the campaign, despite the fact that all his training was in physics.Modern biology was notoriously gooey, and a lot of physicists hated it, but the people at Acheron said Sax was a quick learner, and John believed it.Sax himself made little snicking noises at his own progress, but it was clear he was deep in.He talked about it all the time, Its the crux, he would say, we need the water and nitrogen out of the ground and the carbon dioxide out of the air, and its going to take biomass to do both.And so he slaved at the screens and in the labs.He listened to Boones report with his usual impassivity.Such a parody of the scientist, John thought.He even wore a lab coat.Seeing his characteristic blink made John think of a story he had heard one of Saxs assistants tell, to a laughing audience at a party: in a secret experiment gone awry, a hundred lab rats that had been injected with an intelligence booster became geniuses.They revolted, escaped from their cages, captured their principal investigator, and strapped him down and retro injected all their minds into his body, using a method they invented on the spot and that scientist was Saxifrage Russell, whitecoated, blinking, twitching, inquisitive, lab bound.His brain the sum of a hundred hyperintelligent rats, and named for a flower like lab rats are, its their little joke, see?It explained a lot.John smiled as he finished his report, and Sax cocked his head at him curiously.Do you think this truck was meant to kill you?I dont know.How do the people there seem?Scared.Think theyre in on it?John shrugged.I doubt it.Theyre probably just worried about what happens next.Sax flicked a hand out.Sabotage like that wont make the slightest dent in the project, he said mildly.I know.Whos doing this, John?I dont know.Could it be Ann, do you think?Has she become another prophet, like Hiroko or Arkady, with followers and a program and the like?You have followers and a program too, John reminded him.But Im not telling my followers to wreck things and try to kill people.Some people think youre trying to wreck Mars.And people will certainly die as a result of terraforming, in accidents.What are you saying?Just reminding you.Trying to get you to see why someone might do this.So you do think its Ann.Or Arkady, or Hiroko, or someone weve never heard of in one of the new colonies.There are a lot of people here now.A lot of factions.I know.Sax walked over to a countertop, drained his battered old coffee mug.Finally he said, Id like you to try to find out who it is.Go where you need to go.Go talk to Ann.Reason with her.There was a plaintive note in his voice: I cant even talk to her anymore.John stared at him, surprised at the display of emotion.Sax took this silence for reluctance, and went on: I know it isnt exactly your thing, but everyone will talk to you.Youre practically the only one left we can say that about.I know youre doing the mohole work, but you can get your team to do your part of that, and keep visiting the moholes as part of this inquiry.There really isnt anyone else who can do it.Theres no real police to turn to.Although if things keep happening, UNOMA will provide some.Or the transnationals.Boone considered it.The sight of that truck, falling out of the sky ...All right.Ill go talk to Ann, anyway.After that we should get together and talk about security for all the terraforming projects.If we can stop anything more from happening, that will keep UNOMA out.Thanks, John.Boone wandered out onto his suites balcony.The concourse was filled with Hokkaido pines, the chilled air stiff with resin.Copper figures walked below, among the tree trunks.Boone considered the new situation.For ten years now he had worked for Russell on terraforming, managing the moholes and doing PR and the like, and he enjoyed the work, but he wasnt on the cutting edge of any of the sciences involved, and so he was out of the decision making loop.He knew that many people thought of him as a figurehead only, a celebrity for consumption back on Earth, a dumb space jock who had gotten lucky once and was living off that for good.That didnt bother John; there were always knee high people hacking away, trying to get everyone down to their size.That was okay, especially since in his case they were wrong.His power was considerable, although perhaps only he could see the full extent of it, as it consisted of an endless succession of face to face meetings, of the influence he had over what people chose to do.Power wasnt a matter of job titles, after all.Power was a matter of vision, persuasiveness, freedom of movement, fame, influence.The figurehead stands at the front, after all, pointing the way.Despite all that, there was something to be said for this new task.He could feel that already.It would be problematic, difficult, perhaps risky ...above all, challenging.A new challenge; he liked that.Going back into his suite, getting into bed (John Boone Slept Here!)it occurred to him that now he was going to be not only the first man on Mars, but the first detective.He grinned at the thought, and the last action of the omegendorph set his nerves aglow.Ann Clayborne was doing a survey in the mountains surrounding the Argyre Basin, which meant John could check out a glider and fly from Senzeni Na to her.So early the next morning he took the elevator balloon up the mooring mast to the stationary dirigible floating over the town, exulting as he rose in the ever expanding view of the big Thaumasia canyons.From the dirigible he lowered himself into the cockpit of one of the gliders hooked to its underside.After securing himself he unhooked, and the glider dropped like a stone until he ran it into the mohole thermal, which tossed it violently upward.He fought for control and banked the big gossamer craft into a steep rising gyre, whooping as he battled the intense buffeting; it was like riding a soap bubble over a bonfire!At 5,000 meters the plume cloud flattened and spread out to the east.John swooped out of his spiral and headed southeast, playing with the glider as he went to get a feel for it.He would have to ride the winds carefully to make it to Argyre.He aimed into the suns smeary yellow blaze.Wind keened over the wings.The land below him was a dark rough orange, shading to a very light orange at the horizon.The southern highlands were wildly pocked in every direction, with the raw primordial lunar look that saturation cratering always had.John loved flying over it, and he piloted unconsciously, concentrating on the land below.It was precious to sit back and fly, feeling the wind as if under his elbows, watching the land and not thinking a thing.He was sixty four years old in this year 2047 (or M year 10 as he usually thought of it), and he had been the most famous man alive for almost thirty of those years; and nowadays he was happiest when he was alone, and flying.After an hour had passed, he started thinking about his new task.It was important not to get caught up in fantasies of magnifying glasses and cigar ash, or gumshoe with handgun; there was work he could do even as he flew.He called up Sax and asked if he could connect his AI into the UNOMA emigration and planetary travel records, without alerting UNOMA to the connection.After some investigation Sax got back to him and said that he could manage that, and so John sent a sequence of questions through, and then continued to fly.An hour and many craters later, Paulines red light blinked rapidly, indicating a downloading of raw data.John asked the AI to run the data through various analyses, and when she was done he studied the results on the screen.Patterns of movement were confusing, but he hoped that when matched with the sabotage incidents, something might turn up.Of course there were people moving around off the record, the hidden colony among them; and who knew what Hiroko and the others thought of the terraforming projects?Still, it was worth a look.The Nereidium Montes popped over the horizon ahead.Mars had never had much tectonic movement, and so mountain ranges were rare.Those that existed tended to be crater rims writ large, rings of ejecta thrown out by impacts so great that the debris fell in two or three concentric ranges, each many kilometers wide, and extremely rugged.Hellas and Argyre, being the biggest basins, therefore had the biggest ranges; and the only other major mountain range, the Phlegra Montes on the slope of Elysium, was probably the fragmentary remains of a basin impact later inundated by the Elysium volcanoes, or by an ancient Oceanus Borealis.Debate raged over that question, and Ann, Johns final authority in such matters, had never expressed an opinion on it.The Nereidium Montes made up the northern rim around Argyre, but currently Ann and her team were investigating the southern rim, the Charitum Montes.Boone adjusted his course southward, and in the early afternoon he soared low over the broad flat plain of the Argyre Basin.After the wild cratering of the highlands, the basin floor seemed smooth indeed, a flat yellowish plain bounded by the big curve of rim ridges.From his vantage he could see about ninety degrees of the arc of the rim, enough to give him a sense of the size of the impact that had formed Argyre; it was an amazing sight.Flying over thousands of Martian craters had given Boone a sense of the sizes they came in, and Argyre was simply off the scale.A quite big crater named Galle was no more than a pockmark in Argyres rim!A whole world must have crashed in here!Or, at the very least, a damn big asteroid.Inside the southeast curve of the rim, on the basin floor against the foothills of the Charitum, he spotted the thin white line of a landing strip.Easy to spot human constructs in such desolation, their regularity stood out like a beacon.Thermals were rising hard off the sun warmed hills, and he turned down into one, dropping with a vibratory humm, the crafts wings bouncing visibly as it stooped.Dropping like a rock, like that asteroid, John thought with a grin, and he pulled up for the landing with a dramatic last flourish, putting down with as much precision as he could muster, aware of his reputation as a hot flyer, which of course had to be reinforced at every opportunity.Part of the job  But it turned out there were only two people in the trailers by the strip, and neither of them had watched him land.They were inside watching TV news from Earth.They looked up when he came in the inner lock door, and jumped to their feet to greet him.Ann was up one of the mountain canyons with a team, they told him, probably no more than two hours drive away.John ate lunch with them, two Brit women with North accents, very tough and charming.Then he took a rover and followed the tracks up a cleft into the Charitum.An hours twisting climb up a flat bottomed arroyo brought him to a mobile trailer, with three rovers parked outside it.Together they gave it the look of a dessicated caf in the Mojave.The trailer was unoccupied.Footprints led away from the camp in many directions.After thinking it over Boone climbed a knoll west of camp, and sat down on its peak.He lay on the rock and slept until the cold penetrated his walker.Then he sat up and tongued a capsule of omegendorph, and watched the black shadows of the hills creep east.He thought about what had happened at Senzeni Na, running through his memories of the hours before and after the accident, the looks on peoples faces, what they had said.The image of the falling truck gave his pulse a little surge.Copper figures appeared in a cleft between hills to the west.He stood and descended the knoll, and met them down at the trailer.What are you doing here?Ann said over the first hundreds band.I want to talk.She grunted and switched off.The trailer would have been a bit crowded even without him.They sat in the main room knee to knee, while Simon Frazier heated spaghetti sauce and boiled water for pasta in the little kitchen nook.The trailers sole window faced east, and as they ate they watched the shadow of the mountains stretch out over the floor of the great basin.John had brought along a half liter bottle of Utopian cognac, and he broke it out after dinner to moans of approval.As the areologists sipped he cleaned the dishes (I want to) and asked how their investigation was going.They were looking for evidence of ancient glacial episodes, which if found would support a model of the planets early history that included oceans filling the low spots.But Ann, John thought as he listened to them; would she want to find evidence of an oceanic past?It was a model that tended to lend moral support to the terraforming project, implying as it did that they were only restoring an earlier state of things.So probably she would not want to find any such evidence.Would that disinclination bias her work?Well, sure.If not consciously, then deeper.Consciousness was just a thin lithosphere over a big hot core, after all.Detectives had to remember that.But everyone in the trailer seemed to agree that they werent finding any evidence for glaciation, and they were all good areologists.There were high basins that resembled cirques, and high valleys with the classic U shape of glacial valleys, and some dome and wall configurations that might have been the result of glacial plucking.All these features had been seen in satellite photos, along with one or two bright flashes that some people had thought might be reflections from glacial polish.But on the ground none of it was holding up.They had found no glacial polish, even in the most wind protected sections of the U shaped valleys; no moraines, lateral or butt; no signs of plucking, or of transition lines where nanatuks would have stuck out of even the highest levels of ancient ice.Nothing.It was another case of what they called sky areology, which had a history going back to the early satellite photos, and even to the telescopes.The canals had been sky areology, and many more bad hypotheses had been formulated in the same way, hypotheses that were only now being tested with the rigor of ground areology.Most collapsed under the weight of surface data, got tossed in the canal as they said.The glacial theory, however, and the oceanic model of which it was part, had always been more persistent than most.First, because almost every model of the planets formation indicated that there should have been a lot of water outgassing, and it had to have gone somewhere.And second, John thought, because there were a lot of people who would be comforted if the oceanic model were true; they would feel less uneasy about the morality of terraforming.Opponents to terraforming, therefore ...No, he was not surprised that Anns team was not finding anything.Feeling the cognac a bit, and irritated by her unfriendliness, he said from the kitchen, But if there were glaciers the most recent would have been, what, a billion years ago?That much time would take care of any of the superficial signs, I should think, glacial polish or moraines or nanatuks.Leaving nothing but the gross landforms, which is what you have.Right?Ann had been silent, but now she said, The landforms arent unique to glaciation.All of them are common in Martian ranges, because they were all formed by rock falling out of the sky.Every kind of formation you can think of is out here somewhere, bizarre shapes limited only by the angle of repose.She had refused any cognac, which surprised John, and now she stared at the floor with a disgusted look.Not U shaped valleys, surely, John said.Yes, U shaped valleys too.The problem is that the oceanic model isnt very falsifiable, Simon said quietly.You can keep failing to find good evidence for it, and we are, but that doesnt disprove it.The kitchen clean, John asked Ann to go out for a sunset walk.She hesitated, unwilling; but it was one of her rituals and everyone knew it, and with a quick grimace and a hard glance she agreed.Once outside he led her up to the same peak he had napped on.The sky was a plum colored arch over the black serrated ridges surrounding them, and stars were popping into existence in a flood, hundreds per eyeblink.He stood by her side; she stared away from him.The ragged skyline might have been a scene from Earth.She was a bit taller than him, a gaunt, angular silhouette.John liked her, but whatever reciprocal liking she may have had for him and they had had some good talks in years past had dissipated when he chose to work with Sax.He could have done anything he liked, her hard looks said, and yet he had chosen terraforming.Well, it was true.He put his hand before her, forefinger raised.She punched her wristpad and suddenly her breathing sighed in his ear.What, she said, without looking his way.Its about the sabotage incidents, he said.I thought so.I suppose Russell thinks Im behind them.Its not so much that  Does he think Im stupid?Does he imagine I think a little bit of vandalism will stop you from your boys games?Well, its more than little bits.Thereve been six major incidents now, and any of them could have killed people.Knocking mirrors out of orbit can kill people?If theyre doing maintenance on them.She hmphed.What else has happened.A truck was knocked off one of the mohole shaft roads yesterday, and almost landed on me.He heard her breath catch.Thats the third truck to go.And that mirror was knocked into a spin with a maintenance worker on it, and she had to do a free solo to a station.It took her more than an hour to get there, and she almost didnt make it.And then an explosives dump went off by accident at the Elysian mohole, a minute after a whole crew left it.And all the lichen at Underhill were killed by a virus that shut down the whole lab.Ann shrugged.What do you expect from GEMs?It could have been an accident, Im surprised it doesnt happen more often.It wasnt an accident.It all adds up to peanuts.Does Russell think Im stupid?You know he doesnt.But its a matter of tipping the balance.A lot of Terran money is being invested in the project, but it wouldnt take much bad publicity to get a lot of it to drop out.Maybe so, Ann said.But you ought to listen to yourself when you say things like that.You and Arkady are the biggest advocates of some kind of new Martian society, you two plus Hiroko, maybe.But the way Russell and Frank and Phyllis are bringing up Terran capital, the whole things going to be out of your hands.Itll be business as usual, and all your ideas will disappear.I tend to think we all want something similar here, John said.We want to do good work in a good place.We just emphasize different parts of the process of getting there, thats all.If we only coordinated our efforts, and worked as a team  We dont want the same things!Ann said.You want to change Mars, and I dont.Its as simple as that.Well ...John faltered before her bitterness.They were moving slowly around the hill, in a complicated dance that imitated the conversation, sometimes face to face, sometimes back to back; and always her voice was right in his ear, and his in hers.He liked that about walker conversations, and used it, that insidious voice in the ear which could be so persuasive, caressing, hypnotic.Its not that simple, even so.I mean, you ought to be helping those of us who are closest to your beliefs, and opposing those furthest away.I do that.Which is why I came to ask you what you know about these saboteurs.It makes sense, right?I know nothing about them.I wish them luck.In person?What?Ive traced your movements in the last couple of years, and youve always been near every incident, within a month or so before it happened.You were in Senzeni Na a few weeks ago on your way here, right?He listened to her breathe.She was angry.Using me as cover, she muttered, and something more he didnt catch.Who?She turned her back on him.You should ask the coyote about this stuff, John.The coyote?She laughed shortly.Havent you heard of him?He wanders around on the surface without a walker, people say.Pops up here and there, sometimes on both sides of the world in a single night.Knew Big Man himself, back in the good old days.And a big friend of Hirokos.And a big enemy of terraforming.Have you met him?She didnt reply.Look, he said after nearly a minute of their shared breathing, people are going to get killed.Innocent bystanders.Innocent bystanders are going to get killed when the permafrost melts and the ground collapses under our feet.I dont have anything to do with that either.I just do my work.Trying to catalog what was here before we came.Yes.But youre the most famous red of all, Ann.These people must have contacted you because of that, and I wish youd discourage them.It might save some lives.She turned to face him.Her helmets faceplate reflected the western skyline, purple above, black below, the border between the two colors jagged and raw.If you left the planet alone, it would save lives.Thats what I want.Id kill you if I thought it would help.After that there was little to say.On the way back down to the trailer, he tried another topic.What do you think happened to Hiroko and the rest of them?They disappeared.John rolled his eyes.She didnt talk to you about it?No.Did she talk to you?No.I dont think she talked to anyone but her group.Do you know where they went?No.Do you have any idea why they left?They probably wanted to get free of us.Make something new.What you and Arkady say you want, they really wanted.John shook his head.If they do it, theyll do it for twenty people.I mean to do it for everyone.Maybe theyre more realistic than you.Maybe.Well find out.Theres more than one way to do this, Ann.You have to learn that.She didnt reply.The others stared at them as they entered the trailer, and Ann, storming into the kitchen nook, was no help.John sat on the arm of the one couch and asked them more questions about their work, and about groundwater levels in Argyre and the southern hemisphere generally.The big basins were low in elevation, but had been dehydrated in the impacts that formed them, and in general it appeared that the planets water had mostly seeped north.Another part of the mystery: no one had ever explained why the northern and southern hemispheres were so different, it was the problem in areology, a solution to which might prove the key to explaining all the other enigmas of the Martian landscape, as tectonic plate theory had once explained so many different problems in geology.In fact some people wanted to use the tectonic explanation again, postulating that an old crust had slid over itself onto the southern half, leaving the north to form a new skin, then all of it freezing in position when planetary cooling stopped all tectonic movement.Ann thought that was ridiculous; in her opinion the northern hemisphere was simply the biggest impact basin of all, the ultimate bang of the Noachian.A similar sized strike had knocked the moon out of the Earth, probably around the same time.The areologists discussed various aspects of the problem for a while, and John listened, asking an occasional neutral question.They turned on the TV for news from Earth, and watched a short feature on the mining and oil drilling that was starting in Antarctica.Thats our doing you know, Ann said from the kitchen.They kept mining and oil out of Antarctica for almost a hundred years, ever since the IGY and the first treaty.But when terraforming began here it all collapsed.Theyre running out of oil down there, and the Southern Club is poor, and theres a whole continent of oil and gas and minerals right next to them, being treated like a national park by the rich northern countries.And then the south saw these same rich northern countries start to take Mars completely apart, and they said What the hell, you can tear a whole planet apart and were supposed to protect this iceberg weve got right next door with all these resources we desperately need?Forget it!So they broke the Antarctic Treaty, and there they are drilling and no ones done a thing about it.And now the last clean place on Earth is gone too.She walked over and sat before the screen, stuck her face in a mug of steaming hot chocolate.Theres more if you want, she said to John rudely.Simon gave him a sympathetic glance, and the others stared round eyed at the both of them, looking appalled to see a fight between two of the first hundred: what a joke that was!It almost made John laugh, and when he got up to pour a mug for himself, he leaned over impulsively and kissed Ann on the top of the head.She stiffened and he went on to the kitchen.We all want different things from Mars, he said, forgetting he had just said the opposite to Ann out on the hill.But here we are, and there arent that many of us, and its our place.We make what we want of it, like Arkady says.Now you dont like what Sax or Phyllis want, and they dont like what you want, and Frank doesnt like what anyone wants, and more people are coming every year supporting one position or another, even if they dont know it.So it could get ugly.In fact its started to get ugly already, with these attacks on equipment.Can you imagine that happening at Underhill?Hirokos group was ripping off Underhill the whole time they were there, Ann said.They had tove been, to take off like that.Yeah, maybe.But they werent endangering peoples lives.The image of the truck falling down the shaft came to him again, quick and vivid.He drank hot cocoa and scalded his mouth.Damn!Anyway, whenever I get discouraged about all this I try to remember that its natural.Its inevitable that people are going to fight, but now were fighting about Martian things.I mean people arent fighting over whether theyre American or Japanese or Russian or Arab, or some religion or race or sex or whatnot.Theyre fighting because they want one Martian reality or other.Thats all that matters now.So were already halfway there.He frowned at Ann, who stared at the floor.Do you see what I mean?She glanced at him.Its the second half that matters.All right, maybe so.You take too much for granted, but thats the way people are.But you have to realize that youre having your effect on us, Ann.Youve changed the way everyone thinks about what were doing here.Hell, Sax and a lot of others used to talk about doing anything possible to terraform as quick as possible driving a bunch of asteroids directly into the planet, using hydrogen bombs to try and start volcanoes whatever it took!Now all those plans have been scrapped because of you and your supporters.The whole vision of how to terraform and how far to go with it has changed.And I think we can eventually reach a compromise value, where we get some protection from radiation, and a biosphere and maybe air we can breathe, or at least not die in immediately and still leave it pretty much like it was before we came.Ann rolled her eyes at this, but he forged on: No ones talking about pumping it up into a jungle planet you know, even if they could!Itll always be cold, and the Tharsis Bulge will always stick right out into space, in effect, so therell be a huge part of the planet thats never touched.And thatll be partly because of you.But whos to say that with that first step done, you wont want more?Maybe some will.But I for one will try to stop them.I will!I may not be on your side, but I see your point.And when you fly over the highlands like I did today, you cant help but love it.People may try to change the planet, but all the while the planet will be changing them too.A sense of place, an aesthetics of landscape, all those things change with time.You know the people who first saw the Grand Canyon thought it was ugly as hell because it wasnt like the Alps.It took them a long time to see its beauty.They drowned most of it anyway, Ann said blackly.Yeah yeah.But who knows what our kids will think is beautiful?Its sure to be based on what they know, and this place will be the only place they know.So we terraform the planet; but the planet areoforms us.Areoforming, Ann said, and a rare little smile flashed over her face.Seeing it John felt his face flush; he hadnt seen her smile like that in years, and he loved Ann, he loved to see her smile.I like that word, she said now.She pointed a finger at him: But Ill hold you to it, John Boone!Ill remember what youve said tonight!Me too, he said.The rest of the evening was more relaxed.And the next day Simon saw him down to the airstrip, to the rover he was going to drive northward, and Simon, who usually would have seen him off with a smile and a handshake, at most a nice to see you, suddenly said to him, I really appreciate what you said last night.I think it really cheered her up.Especially what you said about kids.Shes pregnant, you see.What?John shook his head.She didnt tell me.Are you the, the father?Yeah.Simon grinned.How old is she now, sixty?Yeah.Its stretching things a bit, so to speak, but its been done before.They took an egg frozen about fifteen years ago, fertilized it and planted it in her.Well see how it goes.They say Hiroko stays pregnant all the time these days, just keeps popping them like an incubator, same C section over and over.They say a lot of things about Hiroko, but its all just stories.Well, but we heard this from someone who supposedly knows.The coyote?John said sharply.Simon raised his eyebrows.Im surprised she told you about him.John grunted, obscurely annoyed.No doubt his fame meant he missed out on a lot of gossip.Its good that she did.Well, anyway He extended his right hand and they shook, hooking their fingers in the stiff clasp that had developed in the old space days.Congratulations.Take care of her.Simon shrugged.You know Ann.She does what she wants.So Boone drove north from Argyre for three days, enjoying the countryside and the solitude, and spending a few hours each afternoon ransacking the planetary records to track peoples movement, looking for correlations with the sabotage incidents.Early on the fourth morning he reached the Marineris canyons, which were some 1,500 kilometers north of Argyre.He ran into a north south transponder road, and followed it up a short rise to the southern rim of Melas Chasma, and got out of the rover to have a proper look.He had never been to this part of the great canyon system; before the completion of the Marineris Transverse Highway it had been extremely hard to get to.It was dramatic, no doubt about it; the Melas cliff dropped a full 3,000 meters from rim to canyon floor, so that the rim had a kind of gliders view north.The other wall of the canyon was just visible out there, its rim peeking over the horizon; and between the two cliffs lay the spacious expanse of Melas Chasma, the heart of the whole Marineris complex.He could just make out the gaps in distant cliffs that marked the entrances to other canyons: Ius Chasma to the west, Candor to the north, Coprates to the east.John walked the broken rim for more than an hour, pulling his helmets binocular lenses down over his faceplate for long periods of time, taking in as much as he could of the greatest canyon on Mars, feeling the euphoria of red land.He threw rocks over the side and watched them disappear, he talked to himself and sang, he hopped on his toes in a clumsy dance.Then he got back in his rover, refreshed, and drove a short distance along the rim, to the start of the cliff road.Here the Transverse Highway became a single concrete lane, and switchbacked down the spine of an enormous rock ramp that extended down from the south rim to the canyon floor.This odd feature, called the Geneva Spur, pointed north almost perpendicularly from the cliff, straight toward Candor Chasma; it was so perfectly placed for their purposes that with the road on it, it looked like a ramp that the road builders had constructed.It was a steep spur, however, and the road had been forced to switchback all the way down, to keep the grade within reason.It was all visible from above, a thousand switchbacks snaking down the spine, looking like yellow thread stitched down a bump in a stained orange carpet.Boone drove down this marvel carefully, turning the rovers steering wheel left then right then left then right, time after time until he actually had to stop to rest his arms, and give himself a chance to look back and up at the southern wall behind him; it was steep indeed, fluted by a fractal pattern of deeply eroded ravines.Then it was off again for another half hours drive, hairpins left and right, again and again, until finally the road extended straight down the top of the flattening spur, which eventually spread out and merged into the canyon floor.And down there was a little cluster of vehicles.It turned out to be the Swiss team that had just finished building the road, and he ended up spending the night with them.They were a group of about eighty: mostly young, mostly married, speaking German and Italian and French and, for his benefit, English in several different accents.They had kids with them, and cats, and a portable greenhouse thick with herbs and garden vegetables.Soon they would be off like gypsies, in a caravan made up mostly of their earthmoving vehicles, traveling up to the west end of the canyon, to thread a road through Noctis Labyrinthus and onto the east flank of Tharsis.After that there would be other roads; perhaps one over the Tharsis Bulge between Arsia Mons and Pavonis Mons, perhaps one north to Echus Overlook.They werent sure yet, and Boone got the impression they didnt really care; they planned to spend the rest of their lives traveling around building roads, so it didnt much matter to them where they went next.Road gypsies forever.They made sure all their kids shook Johns hand, and after dinner he gave a short talk, rambling in his usual way about their new life on Mars.When I see you people out here it makes me really happy because its part of a new pattern to life, weve got the chance to create a new society out here, everythings changing on the technical level and the social level might as well follow.Im not exactly sure what the new society should be or should look like, thats the hard part after all, but I know that it should be done, and I think you and all the other small groups out on the surface are figuring it out on an empirical basis.And seeing you helps me to think about it.Which it did, though he was never much at doing it on his feet; so he just slithered along a bit more in his free associational way, plucking whatever stuck out of the bag of his thoughts.And their eyes shone in the lamplight as they listened to him.Later he sat with a few of them in a circle around a single lit lamp, and they stayed up through the night talking.The young Swiss asked him questions about his first trip, and about the first years in Underhill, both of which obviously had mythic dimensions for them, and he told them the real story, sort of, and made them laugh a lot; and asked them questions about Switzerland, how it worked, what they thought of it, why they were here rather than there.A blond woman laughed when he asked that.Do you know about the Bgen?she said, and he shook his head.Hes part of our Christmas.Sami Claus comes to all the houses one by one, you see, and he has an assistant, the Bgen, who wears a cloak and a hood and carries a big bag.Sami Claus asks the parents how the children have been that year, and the parents show him the ledger, the record you know.And if the children have been good, Sami Claus gives them presents.But if the parents say the children have been bad, the Bgen sweeps them up in his bag and carries them away, and theyre never seen again.What!John cried.That is what they tell you.That is Switzerland.And that is why I am here on Mars.The Bgen carried you here?They laughed, the woman too.Yes.I was always bad.She grew more serious.But we will have no Bgen here.They asked him what he thought of the debate between the reds and the greens, and he shrugged and summarized what he could of Ann and Saxs positions.I dont think they are either right, one of them said.His name was Jrgen and he was one of their leaders, an engineer who seemed some kind of cross between a burgermeister and a gypsy king, dark haired and sharp faced and serious.Both sides say they are in favor of nature, of course.One has to say this.The reds say that the Mars that is already here is nature.But it is not nature, because it is dead.It is only rock.The greens tell this, and say they will bring nature to Mars with their terraforming.But that is not nature either, that is only culture.A garden, you know.An artwork.So neither way gets nature.There isnt such a thing as nature possible on Mars.Interesting!John said.Ill have to tell Ann that, and see what she says.But....He thought about it.Then what do you call this?What do you call what youre doing?Jrgen shrugged, grinned.We dont call it anything.It is just Mars.Perhaps that was being Swiss, John thought.He had been meeting them more and more in his travels, and they all seemed like that.Do things, and dont worry too much about theory.Whatever seemed right.Later still, after they had drunk another few bottles of wine, he asked them if they had ever heard of the coyote.They laughed and one said, Hes the one who came here before you, right?They laughed again at his expression.A story only, one explained.Like the canals, or Big Man.Or Sami Claus.Driving north the next day across Melas Chasma, John wished (as he had before) that everyone on the planet was Swiss, or at least like the Swiss.Or more like the Swiss in certain ways, anyway.Their love of country seemed to be expressed by making a certain kind of life: rational, just, prosperous, scientific.They would work for that life anywhere, because to them it was the life that mattered, not a flag or a creed or a set of words, nor even that small rocky patch of land they owned on Earth.The Swiss road building crew back there was Martian already, having brought the life and left the baggage behind.He sighed, and ate lunch as his rover rolled past transponders north.It was not that simple, of course.The road building crew were traveling Swiss, gypsies of a sort, the kind of Swiss who spent most of their life out of Switzerland.There were a lot of those, but they were selected out by that choice, they were different.The Swiss who stayed at home were pretty intense about Swissness; still armed to the teeth, still willing to be the bagman for whoever brought them cash; still not a member of the U. N.  Although that fact, given the power UNOMA currently had over the local situation, made them even more interesting to John, as a model.That ability to be part of the world but to stand away from it at the same time; to use it, but hold it off; to be small but in control, to be armed to the teeth but never go to war; wasnt that one way of defining what he wanted for Mars?It seemed to him there were some lessons there, for any hypothetical Martian state.He spent a fair amount of his time alone thinking about that hypothetical state; it was a kind of obsession with him, and he found it very frustrating that he could not seem to come up with anything more than vague desires.And so now he thought hard about Switzerland and what it might tell him, he tried to be organized about it: Pauline, please call up an encyclopedia article on the Swiss government.The rover passed transponder after transponder as he read the article that came up on the screen.He was disappointed to find that there was nothing obviously unique about the Swiss system of government.Executive authority was given to a council of seven, elected by the assembly.No charismatic president, which some part of Boone did not like very much.The assembly, aside from selecting the federal council, appeared to do little; it was caught between the power of the executive council and the power of the people, as exercised in direct initiatives and referendums, an idea they had gotten in the nineteenth century from California of all places.And then there was the federal system; the cantons in all their diversity were supposed to have a great deal of independence, which also weakened the assembly.But cantonal power had been eroding for generations, the federal government wresting away more and more.What did it add up to?Pauline, please call up my constitution file.He added a few notes to the file he had just recently begun: Federal council, direct initiatives, weak assembly, local independence, particularly in cultural matters.Something to think over, anyway.More data to add to the stew of his ideas.It helped somehow to write it down.He drove on, remembering the road builders calmness, their strange mixture of engineering and mysticism.The warmth of their welcome, which wasnt something Boone took for granted; it didnt always happen.In the Arab and Israeli settlements, for instance, he was received very stiffly, perhaps because he was seen as being antireligion, perhaps because Frank had been spreading tales against him.He had been amazed to discover an Arabic caravan whose members believed he had forbidden the building of a mosque on Phobos, and they had only stared at him when he denied even hearing about such a plan.He was pretty sure that was Franks doing, word got back to him through Janet and others that Frank was prone to undercutting him in that way.So yes, there were definitely groups that greeted him coolly: the Arabs, the Israelis, the nuclear reactor teams, some of the transnational executives ...groups with their own intense and parochial programs, people who objected to his larger perspective.Unfortunately there were a lot of them.He came out of his reverie and looked around, and was surprised to discover that out in the middle of Melas it looked exactly as if he were out on the northern plains somewhere.The great canyon was 200 kilometers wide at this point, and the curvature of the planet was so sharp that the north and south canyon walls, all three vertical kilometers of them, were completely under the horizons.Not until the following morning did the northern horizon double, and then separate out into the canyon floor and the great northern wall, which was cut in two by the gap of a short north south canyon connecting Melas and Candor.It was only when he drove into that wide slot that he had the kind of view people thought of when they imagined being down in Marineris: truly giant walls flanked him on both sides, dark brown slabs riven by a fractal infinity of gullies and ridges.At the foot of the walls lay the huge spills of ancient rockfall, or the broken terracing of fossil beaches.In this gap the Swiss road was a line of green transponders, snaking past mesas and arroyos, so that it looked as if Monument Valley had been relocated at the bottom of a canyon twice as deep and five times as wide as the Grand Canyon.The sight was too astonishing for John to be able to concentrate on anything else, and for the first time in his journey he drove all day with Pauline off.North of the transverse gap, he drove into the huge sink of Candor Chasma, and now it was as if he were in a gigantic replica of the Painted Desert, with great deposition layers everywhere, bands of purple and yellow sediment, orange dunes, red erratics, pink sands, indigo gullies truly a fantastic, extravagant landscape, disorienting to the eye because all the wild colors made it hard to figure out what was what, and how big it was, and how far away.Giant plateaus that seemed about to block his way would turn out to be curving strata on a distant cliff; small boulders next to the transponders would turn out to be enormous mesas half a days drive away.And in the sunset light all the colors blazed, the whole Martian spectrum revealed and blazing as if color was bursting out of the rock, everything from pale yellow to dark bruised purple.Candor Chasma!He was going to have to come back some time and explore it.The day after that, he drove up the steady slope of the north Ophir road, which the Swiss crew had completed the previous year.Up and up and up, and then, without ever seeing a distinct rim, he was out of the canyons, rolling past the domed holes of Ganges Catena, and then over the old familiar plain, following a wide road, over the tight horizon past Chernobyl and Underhill; then on for another day west to Echus Overlook, Saxs new terraforming headquarters.His journey had taken a week, and crossed 2,500 kilometers.Sax Russell was back from Acheron, in his own place.He was a power now and no doubt about it, having been named by UNOMA a decade before as scientific head of the terraforming effort.And of course that decade of power had had its effect on him.He had solicited U. N.  and transnational aid to build a whole town to serve as headquarters for the terraforming effort, and he had placed this town about 500 kilometers due west of Underhill, on the edge of the cliff that formed the eastern wall of Echus Chasma.Echus was one of the narrowest and deepest canyons on the planet, and its eastern wall was even taller than south Melas; the section they had chosen to build the town into was a vertical basalt cliff four thousand meters high.At the top of the cliff there was very little sign of the new town; the land behind the rim was almost unmarked, only a concrete pillbox here and there, and to the north the plume of a Rickover.But when John climbed out of his rover into one of the rim pillboxes, and got in one of the big elevators inside it, the extent of the town began to come clear; the elevators went down fifty floors.And when he descended fifty stories, he got out and found other elevators that would take him even lower, a whole series of them, descending right down to the floor of Echus Chasma.Say a story was ten meters; that meant there was room in the cliff for 400 stories.Actually not that much of the room had been used yet, and most of the rooms built so far were clustered up in the highest twenty floors.Saxs offices, for instance, were very near the top.His meeting room was a big open chamber, with a continuous floor to ceiling window as its western wall.When John walked into the room looking for Sax, it was still mid morning, and the window was almost clear; far, far below lay the chasm floor, still half in shadow, and there out in the sunlight stood the much lower western wall of Echus, and beyond that the great slope of the Tharsis Bulge, rising higher and higher to the south.Out in the middle distance was the low bump of Tharsis Tholus, and to the left of it, just poking over the horizon, lay the purple flat topped cone of Ascraeus Mons, the northernmost of the great prince volcanoes.But Sax was not in the meeting room, and he never looked out this window as far as John could tell.He was next door in a lab, more lab rat than ever, hunch shouldered and twitch whiskered, gazing around at the floor, speaking in a voice that sounded like an AI.He led John through a whole sequence of labs, leaning forward to peer into screens or at inching graph paper, talking to John over a shoulder, in a state of distraction.The rooms they passed through were jammed with computers, printers, screens, books, rolls and stacks of paper, disks, GC mass specs, incubators, fume hoods, long apparatus filled lab tables, whole libraries; and placed on every precarious surface were potted plants, most of them unrecognizable bulges, armored succulents and the like, so that at a glance it looked like a virulent mold had sprung up and covered everything.Your labs are getting kind of messy, John said.The planet is the lab, Sax replied.John laughed, moved a bright yellow surarctic cactus from a countertop and sat down.It was said Sax never left these rooms anymore.What are you simming today?Atmospheres.Of course.It was a problem that gave Sax a serious case of the blinks.All the heat they were releasing or applying to the planet was thickening the atmosphere, but all their CO2 fixing strategies were thinning it; and as the chemical composition of the air slowly shifted to something less poisonous it became less greenhouse gassed as well, so that things cooled back down and the process slowed.Negative feedback countering positive feedback, all over the place.Juggling all these factors into any meaningful extrapolative program was more than anyone had yet accomplished to Saxs satisfaction, so he had resorted to his usual solution; he was trying to do it himself.He paced the narrow aisles left between equipment, moving chairs out of his way.Theres just too much carbon dioxide.In the old days the modelers swept that under the rug.I think Im going to have to have robots feed the southern polar cap into Sabatier factories.What we can process wont sublime, and we can release the oxygen and make bricks of the carbon, I guess.Well have more carbon blocks than well know what to do with.Black pyramids to go along with the white.Pretty.Uhn.The Crays and the two new Schillers hummed away behind him, providing his monotonal recitative with a ground bass.These computers spent all their time running through one set of conditions after another, Sax said; but the results, while never the same, were seldom encouraging.The air was going to be cold and poisonous for a good while yet.Sax wandered down the hall, and John followed him into what looked like another lab, although there was a bed and a refrigerator in one corner.Violently disarranged bookscapes were overgrown with potted plants, bizarre Pleistocene growths that looked as deadly as the air outside.John sat in the lone empty chair.Sax stood and looked down at a seashell shrub as John described his meeting with Ann.Do you think shes involved?Sax said.I think she may know who is.She mentioned someone called the coyote.Ah yes.Sax glanced briefly at John at his feet, to be precise.Shes siccing us onto a legendary character.Hes supposed to have been on the Ares with us, you know.Hidden by Hiroko.John was so surprised that Sax had heard of the coyote that it took him a while to figure out what else was disturbing about what he had said.But then it came to him.One night Maya had told him that she had seen a face, the face of a stranger.The voyage out had been hard on Maya, and he had discounted the tale.But now ...Sax was wandering around turning on lights, peering at screens, muttering about security measures.He opened the refrigerator door briefly and John caught a glimpse of more spiky growths; either he kept experiments in there, or else his snack food had suffered a truly virulent eruption of mold.John said, You can see why most of the attacks have been on the moholes.Theyre the easiest project to attack.Sax tilted his head to the side.Are they?Think about it.Your little windmills are everywhere, theres nothing to be done about them.People are disabling them.Weve had reports.What, a dozen?And how many are out there, a hundred thousand?Theyre junk, Sax.Litter.Your worst idea.And nearly fatal to his project, in fact, because of the algae dishes Sax had hidden in some of them.All of that algae had died, apparently but if it hadnt, and if anyone had been able to prove Sax had been responsible for its dissemination, he could have lost his job.It was yet another indication that Saxs logical manner was a front.Now his nose was wrinkled.They add up to a terawatt a year.And knocking a few apart wont do anything to that.As for the other physical operations, the black snow algae is on the northern polar cap, and cant be removed.The dawn and dusk mirrors are in orbit, and its not so easy to knock them out.Someone did it to Pythagoras.True, but we know who it was, and theres a security team following her.She may never lead them to anyone else.They may be able to afford to expend a person per act, I wouldnt be surprised.Yeah, but some simple changes in screening personnel would make it impossible for anyone to smuggle any tools aboard.They could use whats out there.Sax shook his head.The mirrors are vulnerable.Okay.More than some projects, anyway.Those mirrors are adding thirty calories per square centimeter per sol, Sax said.And more all the time.Almost all the freighters from Earth were sunsailers now, and when they arrived in the Martian system they were linked to large collections of earlier arrivals parked in areosynchronous orbit, and programmed to swivel so that they reflected their light onto the terminators, adding a little bit of energy to each days dawn and dusk.The whole arrangement had been coordinated by Saxs office, and he was proud of it.Well increase security for all the maintenance crews, John said.So.Increased security on the mirrors and at the moholes.Yes.But thats not all.Sax sniffed.What do you mean?Well, the problem is that it isnt just the terraforming projects per se that are potential targets.I mean, the nuclear reactors are part of the project too in their way; they provide a lot of your power, and theyre pumping out heat like the furnaces they are.If one of them were to go, it would cause all kinds of fallout, more political even than physical.The vertical lines between Saxs eyes reached up nearly to his hairline.John held out his palms.Not my fault.Thats just the way it is.Sax said, AI, take a note.Look into reactor security.Note taken, one of the Schillers said, sounding just like Sax.And thats not the worst, John said.Sax twitched, glared furiously at the floor.The bioengineering labs.Saxs mouth became a tight line.New organisms are being cooked up daily, John went on, and it might be possible to create something that would kill everything else on the planet.Sax blinked.Lets hope none of these people think like you.Im just trying to think like them.AI, take a note.Biolab security.Of course Vlad and Ursula and their group have stuck suicide genes into everything theyve made, John said.But those are meant to stop oversuccess, or mutational accidents.If someone were to deliberately circumvent them, and concoct something that fed on oversuccess, we could be in trouble.I see that.So.The labs, the reactors, the moholes, the mirrors.It could be worse.Sax rolled his eyes.Im glad you think so.Ill talk to Helmut about it.Ill be seeing him soon anyway.It looks like theyre going to approve Phylliss elevator at the next UNOMA session.That will cut the costs of terraforming tremendously.Eventually it will, but the initial investment must be huge.Sax shrugged.Push an Amor asteroid into orbit, set up a robot factory, let it go to work.Its not as expensive as you might think.John rolled his eyes.Sax, whos paying for all this?Sax tilted his head, blinked.The sun.John stood, suddenly hungry.Then the sun calls the shots.Remember that.Mangalavid broadcast six hours of local amateur video every evening, a weird grab bag of stuff that John watched every chance he got.So after building a big green salad in the kitchen he went to the window room on the dorm floor, and watched while eating, glancing from time to time at the florid sunset over Ascraeus.The first ten minutes of that evenings broadcast had been shot by a sanitary engineer working on a waste processing plant in Chasma Borealis.Her voice over was enthusiastic but boring, Whats nice is we can pollute all we want with certain materials, oxygen, ozone, nitrogen, argon, steam, some biota which gives us leeway we didnt have back home, we just keep grinding what they give us till we can let it loose.Back home, John said to himself.A newcomer.After her there was an attempt at a karate bout, both hilarious and beautiful at the same time; and then twenty minutes of some Russians staging Hamlet in pressure suits at the bottom of the Tyrrhena Patera mohole, a production that struck John as crazy until Hamlet caught sight of Claudius kneeling to pray, and the camera tilted up to show the mohole as cathedral walls, rising above Claudius to an infinitely distant shaft of sunlight, like the forgiveness he would never receive.John shut off the TV and took the elevator down to the dorm.He got into bed and relaxed.Karate as ballet.The newcomers were all still engineers, construction workers, scientists of all kinds.But they didnt seem as single minded as the first hundred, and that was probably good.They still had a scientific mindset and worldview, they were practical, empirical, rational; one could hope that the selection process on Earth was still working against fanaticism, sending up people with a kind of traveling Swiss sensibility, practical but open to new possibilities, able to form new loyalties and beliefs.Or so he hoped.He knew by now it was a bit nave.You only had to look at the first hundred to realize scientists could become as fanatical as anybody else, maybe more so; educations too narrowly focused, perhaps.Hirokos team disappearing....Out there in the wild rock somewhere, lucky bastards....He fell asleep.He worked at Echus Overlook a few days more, then got a call from Helmut Bronski in Burroughs, who wanted to confer with him about the new arrivals from Earth.John decided to take the train to Burroughs and see Helmut in person.The night before his departure, he went to see Sax in his labs.When he walked in Sax said in his monotone, Weve found an Amor asteroid thats ninety percent ice, in an orbit that will bring it near Mars in three years.Just what Ive been looking for, in fact.His plan was to place a robot controlled mass driver on an ice asteroid and push it into an aerobraking orbit around Mars, thus burning it up in the atmosphere.This would satisfy UNOMA protocols forbidding the kind of mass destruction that a direct impact would cause, but it would still add huge quantities of water and separated hydrogen and oxygen to the atmosphere, thickening it with precisely the gases they needed most.It could raise the atmospheric pressure by as much as fifty milli bars.Youre kidding!The pre arrival average at the datum had been between seven and ten millibars (Earths sea level averaged 1,013), and all their efforts so far had only raised the average to around fifty.One iceball will double the atmospheric pressure?Thats what the simulations indicate.Of course with the initial level so low, doubling is not as impressive as it sounds.Still, thats great, Sax.And itll be hard to sabotage.But Sax didnt want to be reminded of that.He frowned slightly, and slipped away.John laughed at his skittishness, and went to the door.Then he stopped to think, and looked up and down the hall.Empty.And no video monitors in Saxs offices.He went back in, grinning at his own furtive tiptoes, and glanced around at the paper chaos on Saxs desk.Where to start?Presumably his AI would be the repository of anything interesting, but probably it would only respond to Saxs voice, and would surely keep a record of any other inquiries.Quietly he opened a desk drawer.Empty.All the drawers in the desk were empty; he almost laughed out loud, stifled it.There was a stack of correspondence on a lab bench, and he picked through it.Mostly notes from the biologists at Acheron.At the bottom of the stack was a single sheet of unsigned mail, with no return address or origin code.Saxs printer had spit it out without any identification that John could see.The message was brief:  1.We use suicide genes to curb proliferation.2.There are so many heat sources now on the surface that we dont think anyone can tell our exhaust from the rest of it.3.We simply agreed we wanted to get off and work on our own, without interference.Im sure you understand now.After a minute of staring at this John whipped his head up and looked around.Still alone.He glanced at the note again, put it back where he had found it and walked quietly out of Saxs offices, back to the guest quarters.Sax, he said admiringly, you tricky congress of rats!The train to Burroughs carried mostly freight, thirty narrow cars of it, with two passenger cars up front, running over a superconducting magnetic piste so quickly and smoothly that it was hard to believe the view; after Johns endless plods cross country in rovers, it was almost frightening.The only thing to do was flood the pleasure centers in the old brain with omegendorph and sit back and enjoy it, looking out at what appeared to be some kind of terrain following supersonic flight.The piste had been routed roughly parallel to the 10  N latitude; eventually the plan was to ring the planet, but so far only the hemisphere between Echus and Burroughs had been finished.Burroughs had become the biggest town in the far hemisphere; the original settlement had been built by an American based consortium using a French led EC design, and was located at the upper end of Isidis Planitia, which was in effect a huge trough where the northern plains made a deep indentation into the southern highlands.The sides and head of the trough counteracted the planets curvature in such a way that the landscape around the town had something like Terran horizons, and as the train flew down the great trough Boone could see across mesa dotted dark plains to horizons some sixty kilometers away.Burroughss buildings were almost all cliff dwellings, cut into the sides of five low mesas that were grouped together on a rise in the bend of an ancient curving channel.Big sections of the mesas vertical sides had been filled by rectangles of mirrored glass, as if postmodern skyscrapers had been turned on their sides and shoved into the hills.A startling sight, in fact, and far more impressive than Underhill, or even Echus Overlook, which had a great view but could not be seen.No, the glass sided mesas of Burroughs, on their rise over a channel that seemed to be begging for water, with a view out to distant hills; these features combined to give the new town a quickly growing reputation as the most beautiful city on Mars.Its western train station was inside one of the excavated mesas, a glass walled room sixty meters high.John stepped out into this grand space and made his way through the crowds of people, head craned back like a hick in Manhattan.Train crews were dressed in blue jumpers, prospecting teams in walker green, UNOMA bureaucrats in suits, construction workers in work jumpers, colored like rainbows to suggest sportswear.UNOMA headquarters had been located in Burroughs three years before, causing a real building boom; it was a close thing whether there were more UNOMA bureaucrats or construction workers in the station.At the far end of the great room John found a subway entrance, and took a little subway car to the UNOMA headquarters.In the car he shook hands with a few people who recognized and approached him, feeling the old weirdness of the fishbowl return.He was back among strangers.In a city.That night he had dinner with Helmut Bronski.They had met many times before, and John was impressed by the man, a German millionaire who had gotten into politics: tall, beefy, blond and red faced, impeccably groomed, dressed in an expensive gray suit.He had been the ECs minister of finance when he took the UNOMA post.Now he told John the latest news, in a very urbane British English, eating roast beef and potatoes rapidly between bursts of sentences, holding his silverware in the workmanlike German fashion.We are going to award a prospecting contract in Elysium to the transnational consortium Armscor.They will be shipping up their own equipment.But Helmut, John said, wont that violate the Mars treaty?Helmut made a wide gesture with the hand holding the fork; they were men of the world, his look said, they understood these kinds of things.The treaty is superannuated, this is obvious to everyone dealing with the situation.But its scheduled revision is ten years away.In the meantime, we have to try to anticipate certain aspects of the revision.Thats why we give some concessions now.There is no rational reason to delay, and if we tried there would be trouble in the General Assembly.But the General Assembly cant be happy that youve given the first concession to an old South African weapons manufacturer!Helmut shrugged.Armscor has very little relation to its origins.It is just a name.When South Africa became Azania, the company moved its home offices to Australia, and then to Singapore.And now of course it has become very much more than an aerospace firm.It is a true transnational, one of the new tigers, with banks of its own, and controlling interest in about fifty of the old Fortune 500.Fifty of them?John said.Yes.And Armscor is one of the smallest of the transnationals, that is why we picked it.But it still has a bigger economy than any but the largest twenty countries.As the old multinationals coalesce into transnationals, you see, they really gather quite a bit of power, and they have influence in the General Assembly.When we give one a concession, some twenty or thirty countries profit by it, and get their opening on Mars.And for the rest of the countries, that serves as a precedent.And so pressure on us is reduced.Uh huh.John thought it over.Tell me, who negotiated this agreement?Well, it was a number of us, you know.Helmut ate on, serenely ignoring Johns steady gaze.John pursed his lips, looked away.He understood suddenly that he was talking with a man who, though a functionary, considered himself to be vastly more important on the planet than Boone.Genial, smooth faced (and who cut his hair?), Bronski leaned back and ordered them after dinner drinks.His assistant, their waitress for the evening, scurried off to oblige.I dont believe Ive been waited on before on Mars, John observed.Helmut met his gaze calmly, but his beefy color had heightened.John almost smiled.The UNOMA factor wanted to seem menacing, the representative of powers so sophisticated that Johns little weather station mentality couldnt even comprehend them.But John had found in the past that a few minutes of his First Man On Mars routine was usually enough to crush that kind of attitude; so he laughed, and drank, and told tales, and alluded to secrets only the first hundred were privy to, and made it clear to the assistant waitress that he was the one in command at the table, and so on behaving in general in an unconcerned, knowing, arrogant manner and by the time they were finished with their sherbet and brandy Bronski was loud and blustery himself, clearly nervous and on the defensive.Functionaries.John had to laugh.But he was curious concerning the ultimate point of their conference, which still wasnt clear to him.Perhaps Bronski had wanted to see in person how news of the new concession would affect one of the first hundred perhaps to gauge the reaction of the rest?That would be silly, for to get a good gauge on the first hundred you would need to poll eighty of them at least; but that didnt mean it wasnt true.John was used to being taken for a representative of things, for a symbol.The figurehead again.It could definitely be a waste of time.He wondered if he could salvage something of his own from the evening, and as they were walking back to his guest suite, he said, Have you ever heard of the coyote?An animal?He grinned, left it at that.In his room he lay on his bed, Mangalavid on the TV, thinking things over.Brushing his teeth before going to sleep, he looked his mirror image in the eye and scowled.He waved his toothbrush in the expansive gesture: Vell, he said in an unfair parody of Helmuts slight accent, ziss is business, you know!Business as usual!The next morning he had a few hours before his first meeting, and so he spent the time with Pauline, going over what he could find out about Helmut Bronskis doings in the last six months.Could Pauline get into the UNOMA diplomatic pouch?Had Helmut ever been to Senzeni Na, or any of the other sabotage sites?While Pauline ran through her search algorithms John swallowed an omegendorph to kill his hangover, and thought about what lay behind this inspiration to search Helmuts records.UNOMA constituted the ultimate authority on Mars these days, at least according to the letter of the law.In practice, as last night had made clear, it had the U. N. s usual toothlessness before national armies and transnational money.Unless it did their bidding it was helpless, it could not succeed against their desires and probably would never even try, as it was their tool.So what did they want, the national governments and the transnational boards of directors?If enough sabotages occurred, would that constitute a reason to bring in more of their own security?Would it tend to increase their control?He made a disgusted noise.Apparently the only result of his investigation so far was that the list of suspects had tripled.Pauline said, Excuse me, John, and the information came up on her screen.The diplomatic pouch, she had found, was coded in one of the new unbreakable encryptions; youd have to get the decryptions to enter it.Helmuts movements, on the other hand, were easily traceable.He had been to Pythagoras, the mirror station that had been spun out of orbit, ten weeks ago.And to Senzeni Na two weeks before Johns visit.And yet no one at Senzeni Na had mentioned his appearance.Most recently, he had just returned from the mining complex being set up at a place called Bradbury Point.Two days later John left to visit it.Bradbury Point was located some 800 kilometers north of Burroughs, at the easternmost extension of the Nilosyrtis Mensae.The mensae were a series of long mesas, like islands of the southern highlands standing out in the shallows of the northern plains.The island mesas of Nilosyrtis had recently been found to be a rich metallogenic province, with deposits of copper, silver, zinc, gold, platinum and other metals.Concentrations of ore like this had been discovered in several locations on the so called Great Escarpment, where the southern highlands dropped to the northern lowlands.Some areologists were going so far as to label the entire escarpment region a metallogenic province, banding the planet like the stitching on a baseball.It was another odd fact to add to the great north south mystery, and a fact that was, of course, getting more than its share of attention.Excavations accompanied by intensive areological studies were being conducted by scientists working for UNOMA and, John discovered as he checked new arrivals employment records, the transnationals all trying to find clues that would enable them to locate more deposits.But even on Earth the geology of mineral formation was not well understood, which was why prospecting still had large elements of chance in it; and on Mars, it was more mysterious yet.The recent finds on the Great Escarpment had been mostly an accident, and only now was the region becoming the main focus for prospecting.The discovery of the Bradbury Point complex had accelerated this hunt, as it was turning out to be as big as the largest Terran complexes, perhaps the equal of the Bushveldt Complex of Azania.So, a gold rush in Nilosyrtis.And Helmut Bronski had visited the scene.Which turned out to be small and utilitarian, a mere beginning; a Rickover and some refineries, next to a mesa hollowed out and filled by a habitat.The mines were scattered in the lowlands between mesas.Boone drove up to the habitat, coupled to the garage, then ducked through the locks.Inside a welcoming committee greeted him, and took him up to a window walled conference room to talk.There were, they said, about 300 people in Bradbury, all employees of UNOMA, and trained by the transnational Shellalco.When they took John on a brief tour, he found they were a mix of ex South Africans, Australians, and Americans, all happy to shake his hand; about three quarters men, pale and clean, looking more like lab techs than the blackened trolls John envisioned when he heard the word miner.Most of them were working on two year contracts, they told him, and keeping track of the time they had left, by the week or even by the day.They ran the mines mostly by teleoperation, and looked shocked when Boone asked to go down into a mine for a look around.Its just a hole, one said.Boone stared at them innocently, and after another moments hesitation, they scrambled to gather an escort team to take him out.It took them two hours to get into walkers and out a lock.They drove to the rim of a mine, and then down a ramp road into a terraced oval pit some two kilometers long.There they got out, and followed John as he walked around.Surrounded by big robotic dozers and dump trucks and earthmovers, his four escorts faceplates were all eyes on the alert for a behemoth on the loose, John guessed.He stared at them, amazed at their timidity; it made him realize, all of a sudden, that Mars could be just another version of the hardship assignment, a hellish combination of Siberia, the interior of Saudi Arabia, the South Pole in winter, and Novy Mir.Or else they just thought he was a dangerous man to be around.Which gave him a start.Everyone had no doubt heard of the falling dump truck; maybe it was just that.But could it be something more?Might these people be aware of something that he wasnt?Reflecting on this for a while, John found his own eyes beginning to press glass.He had been thinking of the falling truck as an accident, or at least something that could only happen once.But his movements were easy to trace, everyone knew where he was.And every time you went outdoors you were only a walker away, as they said.And in a pit mine there were a lot of behemoths about....But they got back in without incident.And that night they had the usual dinner and party in his honor, a hard drinking party, with a lot of omegendorph consumption and loud raucous talk: a bunch of young tough engineers, pleased to find that John Boone was actually a fun guy to party with.A fairly common reaction among newcomers, especially younger men.John chatted them up, and had a good time, and slipped his inquiries into the flow pretty unnoticeably, he thought.They had not heard of the coyote, which was interesting, as they did know about Big Man, and the hidden colony.Apparently the coyote was not in that category of tale; he was some kind of insider thing, known, so far as John could tell, only to some of the first hundred.The miners had had a recent unusual visit, however; an Arab caravan had come by, traveling the edge of Vastitas Borealis.And, they said, the Arabs had claimed to have been visited by some of the lost colonists, as they called them.Interesting, John said.It seemed unlikely to him that Hiroko or any of her crew would reveal themselves, but who could tell?He might as well go check it out; after all, there was only so much he could do at Bradbury Point.Very little detective work, he was noticing, could be accomplished before a crime occurred.So he spent a couple more days observing the mining, but that only reinforced his shock at the scale of the operation, at how much robotic earthmovers could tear away.What are you going to do with all the metal?he asked, after taking a look down into another great open pit mine, located twenty five kilometers to the west of the habitat.Getting it to Earth will cost more than its worth, wont it?The chief of operations, a black haired man with a hatchet face, grinned.Well hold onto it until its worth more.Or until they build that space elevator.You believe in that?Oh yeah, the materials are there!Graphite whisker reinforced with diamond spirals, why you could almost build one on Earth with that.Here it would be easy.John shook his head.That afternoon they drove for an hour back to the habitat, past raw pits and slag heaps, toward the distant plume of the refineries on the other sides of the habitat mesa.He was used to seeing the land torn up for building purposes, but this ...It was amazing what a few hundred people could do.Of course it was the same technology that was allowing Sax to build a vertical town the whole height of the Echus Overlook, the same technology that allowed all the new towns to be built so quickly; but still, wreaking such havoc just to strip away metals, destined for Earths insatiable demand....The next day he gave the operations chief a fiendishly tight security regimen, to be followed for two months.Then he drove out into the wind eroded tracks of the Arab caravan, and followed them north and east.It turned out that Frank Chalmers was traveling with this Arab caravan.But he had not seen or heard of any visitation by Hirokos people, and none of the Arabs would admit to being the one who had told the story at Bradbury Point.A false lead, then.Or else one that Frank was helping the Arabs to eliminate; and if so, how would John find that out?Though the Arabs had only recently arrived on Mars, they were already Franks allies, no doubt about it; he lived with them, he spoke their language, and now, naturally, he was the constant mediator between them and John.Not a chance of an independent investigation, except what Pauline could do in the records, which she could do as well away from the caravan as in it.Nevertheless, John traveled with them for a while as they roamed the great dune sea, doing areology and a bit of prospecting.Frank was only there briefly himself, to talk to an Egyptian friend; he was too busy to stay anywhere for long.His job as U. S.  Secretary made him as much of a globe trotter as John, and they crossed paths pretty frequently.Frank had managed to keep his position as the American department head now through three administrations, even though it was a cabinet post a remarkable feat, even without considering his distance from Washington.And so he was now overseeing the introduction of investment by the American based transnationals, a responsibility that made him manic with overwork and puffed up with power, what John thought of as the business version of Sax, always moving, always gesturing with his hands as if conducting the music of his speech, which had shifted over the years to full tilt Chamber of Commerce overdrive, Got to stake a claim on the Escarpment before the transnats and the Germans snap everything up, lotta work to be done!which was his constant refrain, often said while pointing for illustration at the little globe he carried with him in his lectern pocket.Look at your moholes, I just entered them last week, one near the North Pole, three in the sixties north and south, four along the equator, four bracketing the South Pole, all of them nicely placed west of volcanic rises to catch their updrafts, its beautiful.He spun the globe and the blue dots marking the moholes blurred for a moment into blue lines.Its good to see you finally doing something useful.Finally.Look, heres the new habitat factory in Hellas.Theyre manufacturing starter units at a rate thatll enable them to handle some three thousand emigrants per ell ess ninety, and given the new fleet of round trip shuttles, thats just barely enough.He saw Johns expression and said quickly, All heat in the end, John, so it helps the terraforming with more than just money and labor, I mean think about it.But do you ever wonder whats going to come of it all?John asked.What do you mean?You know, this deluge of people and equipment, while things are falling apart on Earth.Things are always going to be falling apart on Earth, you might as well get used to it.Yeah, but whos going to own what up here?Whos going to call the shots?Frank just made a face at Johns navet, at the very nature of the question.One look at his grimace and John could read it all, the whole complex of disgust and impatience and amusement.A part of John was pleased at this instant recognition; he knew his old friend better than he had ever known any of his family, so that the swarthy pale eyed face glowering at him was like that of a brother, a twin that he couldnt ever remember not knowing.On the other hand, he was annoyed with Frank for his condescension.People are wondering about it, Frank.Its not just me, and its not just Arkady.You cant just shrug it off and act like its a stupid question, like theres nothing to be decided.The U. N.  decides, Frank said brusquely.Theres ten billion of them, and ten thousand of us.Thats a million to one.If you want to influence those kind of odds you ought to have become the UNOMA factor like I told you to when they set up the position.But you didnt listen to me.You just shrugged it off.You could have really done something, but now what are you?Saxs assistant in charge of publicity.And development, and security, and Terran affairs, and the moholes.Ostrich!Frank pounced.Head in a hole!Come on, lets go eat.John agreed and they went off to a dinner in the Arabs biggest rover, a meal of basted lamb and dill flavored yogurt, delicious and exotic.But John found himself still irritated at Franks scorn, which never let up.The old rivalry, sharp as ever; and no First Man routine would ever make a dent in Franks sneery arrogance.Thus when Maya Toitovna showed up unexpectedly the next day, traveling west on her way to Acheron, John gave her a longer hug than he might have otherwise, and by the time that nights dinner was over, he had made certain that she would spend the night in his rover a matter of a particular attentiveness, a certain laugh, a certain look, the nearly accidental brushing of arms together as they stood trying sherbets, talking to the happy men of the caravan, who clearly found her fascinating....All their old code of conciliation and seduction, established through the years.And Frank could only watch, deadpan, talking in Arabic to his Egyptian friends.And that night, as John and Maya made love in Johns rover bed, John pulled up from her briefly and looked down at her white body, and thought, So much for political power Frank buddy!That deadpan look had told it all, the fierce desire for Maya still there, still burning.Frank, like most of the men in the caravanserai that night, would have loved to have been in Johns place at that moment; once or twice in the past he no doubt had been; but not when John was around.No, tonight Frank would be reminded what real power was made of.Distracted by such nastiness, it took John a while to pay any real attention to Maya herself.It had been almost five years since he and she had slept together, and in the intervening time he had had several other partners, and knew she had lived for a time with an engineer in Hellas.It was strange to begin again, as they knew each other intimately and yet didnt.Her turning face flickering under him in the dim light, sister then stranger, sister then stranger....Something happened, then, something turned in him; all that exterior business fell away, all those games.Something in her face, in the way she was all there, the way she would give her whole self to him when they made love.He didnt know anyone else who was quite like that.And thus the old flame sparked again, uncertainly at first, as it had not been there at all in their first lovemaking.But then, after an hours quiet talk, they had started kissing and rolled together and suddenly it was ablaze and they were inside it.Lit up by Maya as usual, he had to admit it.She made him pay attention.Sex for her was not (as it tended to be for John) some kind of extension of sport; it was a grand passion to her, a transcendent state of being, and she was so tigerish when she got going that she always surprised him, woke him up, brought him up to her level, reminded him what sex could be.And it was wonderful to be reminded again, to learn that again really wonderful.Omegendorph was nothing to it, how could he have forgotten, why did he keep wandering away from her as if she werent, somehow, irreplaceable?He crushed her with a hug and they twisted together, bit at each other, panted and moaned; came together as they had so often before, Maya pulling him over the edge with her.Their ritual.And even afterward, just talking, he somehow felt very much more fond of her.He had started things just to irk Frank, it was true; he had been completely careless of her.But now, lying beside her, he could feel how much he had missed her presence in the previous five years, how bland life had seemed.How much he had missed her!New feelings they always surprised him, he kept assuming he was too old for them, that he had more or less stopped changing.And then something would happen.And so often that something (thinking back over the years) was a meeting with Maya....She was still the same Maya Toitovna, however: mercurial, full of her own thoughts and plans, full of herself.She had no idea what John was doing out there on the dunes, and would never think to ask.And she would slash him to ribbons if he accidentally crossed her mood, he could tell that just in the sultry set of her shoulders, just in the way she padded off to the toilet.But he knew all that already, it was old news, something from the first years at Underhill, so long ago; and the sheer familiarity of it was pleasing even her irritability was pleasing!Like Frank and his scorn.Well, he was getting old, and they were family.He almost laughed, he almost said something to set her off, then thought better of it.Just knowing was enough, no need for another demonstration, Lord!At that thought he did laugh, and she smiled to hear it, and came back to bed and shoved him in the chest.Laughing at me again I see!Because of my fat bottom is it?You know your bottom is perfect.She shoved him again, insulted at what she considered a gross lie, and their wrestling drew them back into the reality of skin and salt, into the world of sex.At some point in the long lazy session he found himself thinking I love you, wild Maya, I really do.It was a disconcerting thought, a dangerous thought.Not something he would risk saying.But it felt true.So a couple of days later, when she left to visit the Acheron group, and asked him to join her there, he was pleased.Maybe in a couple of months.No, no.Her face was serious.Come sooner, I want you there with me sooner.And when he agreed, on a whim, she grinned like a girl with a secret.You wont be sorry.With a kiss she was off, driving south to Burroughs to catch the train west.After that, there was less chance than ever of learning anything from the Arabs.He had offended Frank, and the Arabs closed ranks behind their friend, as was only right.Hidden colony?they said.What was that?He sighed and gave up on it, and decided to leave.Stocking his rover the night before his departure (the Arabs were punctilious about filling his hold with supplies), he pondered what he had accomplished so far in his investigation of the sabotages.Sherlock Holmes was in no danger, that was sure.Worse than that, there was now a whole society on Mars that was basically impenetrable to him.Moslems, what were they exactly?He read Pauline that evening after he was done stocking, and then he rejoined his hosts and watched them as closely as he was able, asking questions all that night long....He knew asking questions was the key to peoples souls, infinitely more useful than wit; but in this case it didnt seem to make any difference.Coyote?Some kind of wild dog was it?Baffled, he left the caravan the next morning and drove west, on the southern border of the dune sea.It would be a long journey to Acheron to join Maya, 5,000 kilometers of dune after dune; but he preferred driving to going down to Burroughs and taking the train.He needed time to think.And really it was a habit now, driving cross country, or flying gliders getting away, traveling slowly across the land.He had been on the road for years now, crisscrossing the northern hemisphere and making long excursions into the south, inspecting moholes or doing favors for Sax or Helmut or Frank, or looking into things for Arkady, or cutting ribbons at the opening of one thing or another a town, a well, a weather station, a mine, a mohole and always talking, talking in public speeches or private conversations, talking to strangers, old friends, new acquaintances, talking almost as fast as Frank did, and all in an attempt to inspire the people on the planet to figure out a way to forget history, to build a functioning society.To create a scientific system designed for Mars, designed to their specifications, fair and just and rational and all those good things.To point the way to a new Mars!And yet after every year that passed it seemed less likely to happen the way he had envisioned it.A place like Bradbury Point showed how rapidly things were changing, and people like the Arabs confirmed the impression; events were out of his control, and more than that, out of anyones control.There was no plan.He rolled west on autopilot, up and down over dune after dune, not seeing a thing, sunk deep in an attempt to understand what exactly history was, and how it worked.And it seemed to him as he drove on day after day that history was like some vast thing that was always over the tight horizon, invisible except in its effects.It was what happened when you werent looking an unknowable infinity of events, which although out of control, controlled everything.After all, he had been here from the very beginning!He had been the beginning, the first person to step on this world, and then he had returned against all the odds, and helped to build it from scratch!And yet now, despite all that, it was spinning away from him.Contemplating that fact made him tense with disbelief, and sometimes with a sudden furious frustration; to think that the whole thing was accelerating not only beyond his control, but even beyond his ability to comprehend it wasnt right, he had to fight it!And yet how?Social planning of some sort ...clearly they had to have it.This flailing about without a plan, in violation of even the flimsy plan people had made back at the beginning with the Mars treaty ...well, societies without a plan, that was history so far; but history so far had been a nightmare, a huge compendium of examples to be avoided.No.They needed a plan.They had a chance at a new start here, they needed a vision.Helmut the oily functionary, Frank with his cynical acceptance of the status quo, his acceptance of the breakdown of the treaty, as if they were in a kind of gold rush Frank was wrong.Wrong as usual!But his own rushing about was probably wrong, too.He had been operating on the unarticulated theory that if he only saw more of the planet, visited one more settlement, talked to one more person, that he would somehow (without really thinking too hard) get it and that his holistic understanding would then flow back from him to everybody else, spreading out through all the new settlers and changing things.Now he was pretty sure that this feeling had been nave; there were so many people on the planet these days he could never hope to connect with them, to become the articulator of all their hopes and desires.And not only that, but few of the newcomers seemed much like the first hundred in regard to their reasons for coming.Well, that wasnt entirely true; there were still scientists coming up, and people like the Swiss road building gypsies.But he didnt know them like he did the first hundred, and he never would.That little band had formed him, really, they had shaped his opinions and ideas, had taught him; they were his family, he trusted them.And he wanted their help, he needed it now more than ever.Perhaps it was this which explained the sudden new intensity of his feeling for Maya.And perhaps it was this which made him so angry with Hiroko he wanted to talk to her, he needed her help!And she had abandoned them.Vlad and Ursula had relocated their biotech complex to a finlike ridge in the Acheron Fossae, a narrow prominence which looked like the conning tower of a vast submerged submarine.They had honeycombed the upper part of it with excavations that extended from cliff to cliff; some of the rooms were a kilometer wide, and glass walled on both sides.The windows on the south side had a view of Olympus Mons, some 600 kilometers away; north facing windows looked down onto the pale tan sands of Arcadia Planitia.John drove up a wide ledge to the bottom of the fin, and plugged into the garage lock door, noticing as he did that the ground in the narrow canyon south of the settlement was lumpy with heaps of what appeared to be melted brown sugar.Its a new kind of cryptogamic crust, Vlad said when John asked him about it.A symbiosis of cyanobacteria and Florida platform bacteria.The platform bacteria goes very deep, and converts sulfates in the rock to sulfides, which then feed a variant of Microcoleus.The top layers of that grow in filaments, which bind to sand and clay in big dendritic formations, so its like little forest sylvanols with really long bacterial root systems.It looks like these root systems will keep on going right down through the regolith to bedrock, melting the permafrost as they go.And youve released this stuff?John said.Sure.We need something to bust up the permafrost, right?Is there anything to stop it from growing planetwide?Well, it has the usual array of suicide genes in case it begins to overwhelm the rest of the biomass, but if it keeps to its niche ...Wow.Its not too unlike the first life forms that covered the Terran continents, we think.Weve just enhanced its speed of growth, and its root systems.The funny thing is that I think at first its going to cool the atmosphere, even though its warming things underground.Because itll really increase chemical weathering of the rock, and all those reactions absorb CO2 from the air, so the air pressure is going to drop.Maya had come up and joined them with a big hug for John, and now she said, But wont the reactions release oxygen as fast as they absorb CO2, and keep air pressure up?Vlad shrugged.Maybe.Well see.John laughed.Sax is a long term thinker.Hell probably be pleased.Oh yes.He authorized the release.And hes coming to study here again when spring comes.They had dinner in a hall located high on the fin, just under the crest.Skylights opened above to the greenhouse on the crest itself, and windows ran the length of the north and south walls; stands of bamboo filled the walls to east and west.All the residents of Acheron were there for dinner, holding to an Underhill custom as they did in many other ways.The discussion at John and Mayas table ranged widely, but kept returning to the current work, which involved trying to solve problems caused by the need to implant safeguards in all the GEMs they were releasing.Double suicide genes in every GEM was a practice the Acheron group had initiated on its own, and it was now going to be codified as U. N.  law.Thats all well and good for legal GEMs, Vlad said.But if some fools try something on their own and blow it, we could be in big trouble anyway.After dinner, Ursula said to John and Maya, Since youre here you ought to get your physicals.Its been a while for both of you.John, who hated physicals and indeed all medical attention of any kind, demurred.But Ursula hounded him, and eventually he gave in, and visited her clinic a couple of days later.There he was put through a battery of diagnostic tests that seemed even more intensive than usual, most of them run by imaging machines and computers with too relaxing voices, telling him to move this way and then that, while John in complete ignorance did what he was told.Modern medicine.But after all that, he was poked and prodded and tapped in time honored fashion by Ursula herself.And when it was over he was lying on his back with a white sheet over him, while she stood at his side, looking at read outs and humming absently.Youre looking good, she told him after several minutes of that.Some of the usual gravity related problems, but nothing we cant deal with.Great, John said, feeling relieved.That was the thing about physicals; any news was bad news, one wanted an absence of news.Getting that was somehow a victory, and more so every time; but still, a negative accomplishment.Nothing had happened to him, great!So do you want the treatment?Ursula asked, her back to him, her voice casual.The treatment?Its a kind of gerontological therapy.An experimental procedure.Somewhat like an inoculation, but with a DNA strengthener.Repairs broken strands, and restores cell division accuracy to a significant degree.John sighed.And what does that mean?Well, you know.Ordinary aging is mostly caused by cell division error.After a number of generations, ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands depending which kind of cells youre talking about, errors in reproduction start to increase, and everything gets weaker.The immune system is one of the first to weaken, and then other tissues, and then finally something goes wrong, or the immune system gets overwhelmed by a disease, and thats it.And youre saying you can stop these errors?Slow them down, anyway, and fix the ones that are already broken.A mix, really.The division errors are caused by breaks in DNA strands, so we wanted to strengthen DNA strands.To do it we would read your genome, and then build an auto repair genomic library of small segments that will replace the broken strands  Auto repair?She sighed.All Americans think that is funny.Anyhow we push this auto repair library into the cells, where they bind to the original DNA and help keep them from breaking.She began to draw double and quadruple helixes as she talked, shifting inexorably into biotech jargon, until John could only catch the general drift of the argument, which apparently had its origins in the genome project and the field of genetic abnormality correction, with application methods taken from cancer therapy and GEM technique.Aspects of these and many other different technologies had been combined by the Acheron group, Ursula explained.And the result seemed to be that they could give him an infection of bits of his own genome, an infection which would invade every cell in his body except for parts of his teeth and skin and bones and hair; and afterward he would have nearly flawless DNA strands, repaired and reinforced strands that would make subsequent cell division more accurate.How accurate?he asked, trying to grasp what it all meant.Well, about like if you were ten years old.Youre kidding.No, no.Weve all done it to ourselves, back around Ls ten of this year, and so far as we can tell, its working.Does it last forever?Nothing lasts forever, John.How long then?We dont know.We ourselves are the experiment, we figure well find out as we go along.It seems possible we might be able to do the therapy again when the rate of division error begins to increase again.If that is successful, it could mean you would last for quite a while.Like how long?he insisted.Well, we dont know, do we.Longer than we live now, thats pretty sure.Possibly a lot longer.John stared at her.She smiled at the expression on his face, and he could feel that his jaw was slack with amazement.No doubt he looked less than brilliant, but what did she expect?It was...it was ...He was following his thoughts with difficulty as they skittered around.Who have you told about this?he asked.Well, we have asked everyone in the first hundred, when they get a check up with us.And everyone here at Acheron has tried it.And the thing is, weve only combined methods, that everyone has, so it wont be long before others try putting it all together too.So were writing it up for publication, but were going to send the articles first to be reviewed by the World Health Organization.Political fallout, you know.Um, John said, considering it.News of a longevity drug loose on Mars, back among the teeming billions...my Lord, he thought.Is it expensive?Not extremely.Reading your genome is the most expensive part, and it takes time.But its just a procedure, you know, its just computer time.Its very possible you could inoculate everyone on Earth.But the population problem down there is already critical as it is.Theyd have to institute some pretty intense population control, or else theyd go Malthusian really fast.We thought wed better leave the decisions to the authorities down there.But word is sure to get out.Is that true?They might try to put a clamp on it.Maybe even a comprehensive clamp, I dont know.Wow.But you folks...you just went ahead and did it?We did.She shrugged.So what do you say?Want to do it?Let me think about it.He went for a walk on the crest of the fin, up and down the long greenhouse stuffed with bamboo and food crops.Walking west he had to shield his eyes from the glare of the afternoon sun, even through the filtered glass; walking back east, he could look out at the broken slopes of lava stretching up to Olympus Mons.It was hard to think.He was sixty six years old, born in 1982, and what was it back on Earth now, 2048?M 11, eleven long hi rad Martian years.And he had spent thirty five months in space, including three trips between Earth and Mars, which was still the record.He had taken on 195 rems in those trips alone, and he had low blood pressure and a bad HDL to LDL ratio, and his shoulders ached when he swam and he felt tired a lot.He was getting old.He didnt have all that many years left, weird though it was to think of it; and he had a lot of faith in the Acheron group, who, now that he looked at them, were wandering around their aerie working and eating and playing soccer and swimming and so on with little smiles of absorbed concentration, with a kind of humming.Not like ten year olds, certainly not; but with an aura of suffused, absorbed happiness.Of health, and more than health.He laughed out loud, and went back down into Acheron looking for Ursula.When she saw him she laughed too.Its not really that hard a choice, is it.No.He laughed with her: I mean, what have I got to lose?So he agreed to it.They had his genome in their records, but it would take a few days to synthesize the collection of repair strands and clip them onto plasmids and clone millions more.Ursula told him to come back in three days.When he got back to the guest rooms Maya was already there, looking as shocked as he felt, wandering nervously from dresser to sink to window, touching things and looking around as if she had never seen such a room before.Vlad had told her about it after her physical, just as Ursula had with John.Immortality plague!she exclaimed, and laughed strangely.Can you believe it?Longevity plague, he corrected her.And no, I cant.Not really.He felt a little dizzy, and he could see she hadnt heard him.Her agitation made him nervous.They heated soup, ate in a daze.Vlad had told Maya to come to Acheron, and intimated what it was all about; that was why she had insisted that John accompany her to Acheron.When she told him that, he felt a shiver of fondness for her.Standing next to her washing the dishes, observing her hands shake as she spoke, he felt exceptionally close to her; it was as if they knew each others thoughts, as if, after all the years, in the face of this bizarre development, there were no need for words, only for each others presence.That night in the warm dark of their bed she whispered hoarsely, Wed better do it twice tonight.While its still us.Three days later they both got the treatment.John lay back on a medical couch in a small room, and stared at an intravenous plug in the back of his hand.An IV feed shot, just like all those hed had before.Except this time he could feel a strange heat rising up his arm, flushing his chest, pouring down his legs.Was it real?Was he imagining it?For a second he felt extremely odd all over, as if his ghost had walked through him.Then he was just very hot.Should I be this hot?he asked Ursula anxiously.Its like a fever at first, she said.Then we put a small shock through you to push the plasmids into your cells.After that its more chills than fever, as the new strands bond to the old.
