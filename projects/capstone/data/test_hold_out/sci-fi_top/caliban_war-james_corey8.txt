Her suit warned her that she was being targeted, and changed the HUD so that the normally invisible infrared beams aimed at her became faint red lines.Half a dozen were painting her chest, all coming from compact black weapons held by Mao Kwik security personnel at the other end of the room.Bobbie stood up.To their credit, the security goons didnt back up.Her HUD ran through the weapons database and informed her that the men were armed with 5mm submachine guns with a standard ammo capacity of three hundred rounds and a cyclic rate of ten rounds per second.Unless they were using high explosive armor piercing rounds, unlikely with the ships hull right behind her, the suit rated their danger level as low.Bobbie made sure her external speakers were still on and said, Okay, fellas, lets   They opened fire.For one long second, the entire galley was in chaos.High impact plastic rounds bounced off her armor, deflected off the bulkheads, and skipped around the room.They blew apart containers of dried goods, hurled pots and pans off their magnetic hooks, and flung smaller utensils into the air in a cloud of stainless steel and plastic shards.One round took a particularly unlucky bounce and hit one of the security guards in the center of his nose, punching a hole into his head and dropping him to the floor with an almost comic look of surprise on his face.Before two seconds could tick by, Bobbie was in motion, launching herself across the steel island in the center of the room and plowing into all five remaining guards with her arms outstretched, like a football player going in for a tackle.They were hurled against the far bulkhead with a meaty thud, then slumped to the ground motionless.Her suit started to put up life sign indicators on her HUD for them, but she shut it off without looking.She didnt want to know.One of the men stirred, then started to raise his gun.Bobbie gently shoved him, and he flew across the room to crumple against the far bulkhead.He didnt move again.She glanced around the room, looking for cameras.She couldnt find one but hoped it was there anyway.If theyd seen this, maybe they wouldnt throw any more of their people at her.At the keel ladder, she discovered that theyd blocked the elevator by jamming the floor hatch open with a crowbar.Basic ship safety protocols wouldnt allow the elevator to move to another deck unless the deck above was sealed.Bobbie yanked out the crowbar and threw it across the room, then hit the call button.The lift climbed up the ladder shaft to her level and stopped.She jumped on and hit the button that would take her to the bridge, eight decks up.Eight more pressure hatches.Eight more possible ambushes.She tightened her hands into fists until the knuckles stretched painfully inside her gauntlets.Bring it.Three decks up the elevator stopped, the panel informing her that all the pressure hatches between her and the bridge had been overridden and forced open.They were willing to risk a hole in the ship emptying out half the ships air rather than let her up to the bridge.It was sort of gratifying to be scarier than sudden decompression.She climbed off the lift onto a deck that appeared to be mostly crew quarters, though it must have been evacuated.There wasnt a soul in sight.A quick tour revealed twelve small crew cabins and two bathrooms that could reasonably be called heads.No gold plating on the fixtures for the crew.No open bar.No twenty four hour a day food service.Looking at the fairly Spartan living conditions of the average crew member on the Guanshiyin brought home Avasaralas last words to her.These were just sailors.None of them deserved to die for what had happened on Ganymede.Bobbie found herself glad she didnt have a gun.She found another access hatch in the head and tore it open.But to her surprise, the service corridor ended just a few feet above her head.Something in the structure of the ship was cutting her off.Having never seen the Guanshiyin from the outside, she had no idea what it might be.But she needed to get another five decks up, and she wasnt about to let this stop her.A ten minute search turned up a service hatch through the outer hull.Shed torn off two inner hull hatches on two different decks, so if she got it open, those two decks would lose their air.But the central ladder corridor was sealed at Avasaralas deck, so her people would be fine.And the whole reason she was doing this was the sealed hatch to the upper decks, which seemed to be where most of the crew was.She thought about the six men down in the galley and felt a pang.Sure, theyd shot first, but if any of them were still alive, she had no desire to asphyxiate them in their sleep.It turned out not to be a problem.The hatch led into a small airlock chamber, about the size of a closet.A minute later it had cycled through and she climbed out onto the outer hull of the ship.Triple hulled.Of course.The lord of the Mao Kwik empire wasnt going to trust his expensive skin to anything that wasnt the safest humans could build.And the ostentatious design of the ship extended to her outer hull as well.While most military ships were painted a flat black that made them hard to spot visually in space, most civilian ships either were left an unpainted gray or were painted in basic corporate colors.The Guanshiyin had a mural painted on it in vivid colors.Bobbie was too close to see what it was, but under her feet were what appeared to be grass and the hoof of a giant horse.Mao had the hull of his ship painted with a mural that included horses and grass.When almost no one would ever see it.Bobbie made sure her boot and glove mags were set strong enough to handle the quarter g thrust the ship was still under, and started climbing up the side.She quickly reached the spot where the dead end between the hulls began, and saw that it was an empty shuttle bay.If only Avasarala had let her do this before Mao had run off with the shuttle.Triple hulls, Bobbie thought.Maximum redundancy.On a hunch, she crawled across the ship to the other side.Sure enough, there was a second shuttle bay.But the ship in it wasnt a standard short flight shuttle.It was long and sleek, with an engine housing twice as large as that of a normal ship its size.Written in proud red letters across the bow of the ship was the name Razorback.A racing pinnace.Bobbie crawled back around to the empty cargo bay and used the airlock there to enter the ship.The military override codes her suit sent to the locked door worked, to her surprise.The airlock led to the deck just below the bridge, the one used for shuttle supply storage and maintenance.The center of the deck was taken up by a large machine shop.Standing in it were the captain of the Guanshiyin and his senior staff.There were no security personnel or weapons in sight.The captain tapped his ear in an ancient can you hear me?gesture.Bobbie nodded one fist at him, then turned the external speakers back on and said, Yes.We are not military personnel, the captain said.We cant defend ourselves from military hardware.But Im not going to turn this vessel over to you without knowing your intentions.My XO is on the deck above us, prepared to scuttle the ship if we cant come to terms.Bobbie smiled at him, though she didnt know if he could see it through her helmet.Youve illegally detained a high level member of the UN government.Acting in my role as a member of her security team, I have come to demand that you deliver her immediately to the port of her choosing, at best possible speed.She shrugged with her hands in the Belter way.Or, you can blow yourselves up.Seems like a drastic overreaction to having to give the undersecretary her radio privileges back.The captain nodded and relaxed visibly.Whatever happened next, it wasnt like he had any choice.And since he didnt have any choice, he didnt have any responsibility.We were following orders.Youll note that in the log when you take command.Ill see that she knows.The captain nodded again.Then the ship is yours.Bobbie opened her radio link to Cotyar.We win.Put Her Majesty on, will you?While she waited for Avasarala, Bobbie said to the captain, There are six injured security people down below.Get a medical team down there.Bobbie?Avasarala said over the radio.The ship is yours, madam.Great.Tell the captain we need to make best possible speed to intercept Holden.Were getting to him before Nguyen does.Uh, this is a pleasure yacht.Its built to run at low g for comfort.Id bet it can do a full g if it needs to, but I doubt it does much more than that.Admiral Nguyen is about to kill everyone that actually might know what the fuck is going on.Avasarala didnt quite yell.We dont have time to cruise around like were trying to pick up fucking rent boys!Huh, Bobbie said.Then, a moment later: If this is a race, I know where theres a racing ship     Thirty Nine: Holden  Holden pulled himself a cup of coffee from the galley coffeepot, and the strong smell filled the room.He could feel the eyes of the crew on his back with an almost physical force.Hed called them all there, and once theyd assembled and taken their seats, hed turned his back on them and started making coffee.Im stalling for time, because I forgot how I wanted to say this.He put some sugar in his coffee even though he always drank it black, just because stirring took a few more seconds.So.Who are we?he said as he stirred.His question was met with silence, so he turned around and leaned back against the countertop, holding his unwanted cup of coffee and continuing to stir.Seriously, he said.Who are we?Its the question I keep coming back to.Uh, Amos said, and shifted in his seat.My names Amos, Cap.You feeling okay?No one else spoke.Alex was staring at the table in front of him, his dark scalp shining through his thinning hair under the harsh white of the galley lights.Prax was sitting on the counter next to the sink and looking at his hands.He flexed them periodically as though trying to figure out what they were for.Only Naomi was looking at him.Her hair was pulled up into a thick tail, and her dark, almond shaped eyes were staring right into his.It was fairly disconcerting.Ive recently figured out something about myself, Holden continued, not letting Naomis unblinking stare throw him off.Ive been treating you all like you owe me something.And none of you do.And that means Ive been treating you like shit.No, Alex started without looking up.Yes, Holden said, and stopped until Alex looked up at him.Yes.You maybe more than anyone else.Because Ive been scared to death and cowards always look for an easy target.And youre about the nicest person I know, Alex.So I treated you badly because I could get away with it.And I hope you forgive me for that, because I really hate that I did it.Sure, I forgive you, Cap, Alex said with a smile and his heavy drawl.Ill try to earn it, Holden answered, bothered by the easy reply.But Alex said something else to me recently that Ive been thinking about a lot.He reminded me that none of you are employees.Were not on the Canterbury.We dont work for PurnKleen anymore.And I dont own this ship any more than any of you do.We took contracts from the OPA in exchange for pocket money and ship expenses, but we never talked about how to handle the excess.You opened that account, Alex said.Yeah, theres a bank account with all of the extra money in it.Last I checked, there was just under eighty grand in there.I said wed keep it for ship expenses, but who am I to make that decision for the rest of you?Thats not my money.Its our money.We earned it.But youre the captain, Amos said, then pointed at the coffeepot.While Holden fixed him a cup, he said, Am I?I was the XO on the Canterbury.It made sense for me to be the captain after the Cant got nuked.He handed the cup to Amos and sat down at the table with the rest of the crew.But we havent been those guys for a long time now.Who we are now is four people who dont actually work for anyone   Prax cleared his throat at this, and Holden nodded an apology at him.Anyone long term, lets say.There is no corporation or government granting me authority over this crew.Were just four people who sort of own a ship that Mars will probably try to take back the first chance they get.This is legitimate salvage, Alex said.And I hope the Martians find that compelling when you explain it to them, Holden replied.But it doesnt change my point: Who are we?Naomi nodded a fist at him.I see where youre going.Weve left a lot of this kind of stuff just up in the air because weve been running full tilt since the Canterbury.And this, Holden said, is the perfect time to figure that stuff out.Weve got a contract to help Prax find his little girl, and hes paying us so we can afford to run the ship.Once we find Mei, how do we find the next job?Do we go looking for a next job?Do we sell the Roci to the OPA and retire on Titan?I think we need to know those things.No one spoke.Prax pushed himself off the counter and started rummaging through the cabinets.After a minute or two, he pulled out a package that read CHOCOLATE PUDDING on the side and said, Can I make this?Naomi laughed.Alex said, Knock yourself out, Doc.Prax pulled a bowl out and began mixing ingredients into it.Oddly enough, because the botanist was paying attention to something else, it created a sense of intimacy for the crew.The outsider was doing outside things, leaving them to talk among themselves.Holden wondered if Prax knew that and was doing it on purpose.Amos slurped down the last of his coffee and said, So, you called this meeting, Cap.You have something in mind?Yeah, Holden said, taking a moment to think.Yeah, kind of.Naomi put a hand on his arm and smiled at him.Were listening.I think we get married, he said with a wink at Naomi.Make it all nice and legal.Wait, she said.The look on her face was more horrified than Holden would have hoped.No, no, thats sort of a joke, Holden said.But only sort of.See, I was thinking about my parents.They formed their initial collective partnership because of the farm.They were all friends, they wanted to buy the property in Montana, and so they made a group large enough to afford it.It wasnt sexual.Father Tom and Father Caesar were already sexual partners and monogamous.Mother Tamara was single.Fathers Joseph and Anton and Mothers Elise and Sophie were already a polyamorous civil unit.Father Dimitri joined a month later when he started dating Tamara.They formed a civil union to own the property jointly.They wouldnt have been able to afford it if they were all paying taxes for separate kids, so they had me as a group.Earth, Alex said, is a weird freakin place.Eight parents to a baby aint exactly common, Amos said.But it makes a lot of economic sense with the baby tax, Holden said.So its not unheard of, either.What about people making babies without paying the tax?Alex asked.Its tougher to get away with than you think, Holden said.Unless you never go to a doctor or only use black markets.Amos and Naomi shared a quick look that Holden pretended not to see.Okay, Holden continued.Forget babies for a minute.What Im talking about is incorporating.If we plan to stick together, lets make it legal.We can draft up incorporation papers with one of the independent outer planets stations, like Ceres or Europa, and become joint owners of this enterprise.What, Naomi said, does our little company do?Exactly, Holden said in triumph.Uh, Amos said again.No, I mean, thats exactly what Ive been asking, Holden continued.Who are we?What do we want to do?Because when this contract with Prax is over, the bank account will be well padded, well own a high tech warship, and well be free to do whatever we damn well want to do.Jesus, Cap, Amos said.I just got half a hard on.I know, right?Holden replied with a grin.Prax stopped mixing things in his bowl and stuck it in the refrigerator.He turned and looked at them with the careful movements of someone who feared hed be asked to leave if anyone noticed him.Holden moved over to him and put an arm around his shoulder.Our friend Prax here cant be the only guy who needs to hire a ship like this, right?Were faster and meaner than just about anything a civvy can dig up, Alex said with a nod.And when we find Mei, it will be as high profile as you could hope for, Holden said.What better advertising could we get than that?Admit it, Cap, Amos said.You just kind of like being famous.If it gets us jobs, sure.Were much more likely to wind up broke, out of air, and drifting through space dead, Naomi said.Thats always a possibility, Holden admitted.But, man, arent you ready to be your own boss for a change?If we find we cant make it on our own, we can always sell the ship for a giant sack of money and go our separate ways.We have an escape plan.Yeah, Amos said.Fuck yeah.Lets do this.How do we start?Well, Holden said.Thats another new thing.I think we have to vote.No one of us owns the ship, so I think we vote on important stuff like this from now on.Amos said, All in favor of making ourselves into a company to own the ship, raise your hand.To Holdens delight, they all raised their hands.Even Prax started to, realized he was doing it, and then put it back down.Ill get us an attorney on Ceres and start the paperwork, Holden said.But that leads to something else.A company can own a ship, but a company cant be the registered captain.Well need to vote for whoever holds that title.Amos started laughing.Gimme a fucking break.Raise your hand if Holden isnt the captain.No hands went up.See?Amos said.Holden started to speak but stopped when something uncomfortable happened in his throat and behind his sternum.Look, Amos said, his face kind.Youre just that guy.Naomi nodded and smiled at Holden, which only made the ache in his chest pleasantly worse.Im an engineer, she said.There isnt a program on this ship I havent tweaked or rewritten, and I could probably take her apart and put her back together by myself at this point.But I cant bluff at cards.And Im never going to be the one that stares down the joint navies of the inner planets and says, Back the hell off.Roger that, Alex said.And I just want to fly my baby.Thats all and thats it.If I get to do that, Im happy.Holden started to speak, but to his surprise and embarrassment, the minute his mouth opened, his eyes teared up.Amos saved him.Im just a grease monkey, he said.I push tools.And I mostly wait for Naomi to tell me when and where to push em.I got no desire to run anything bigger than that machine shop.Youre the talker.Ive seen you face down Fred Johnson, UN naval captains, OPA cowboys, and drugged up space pirates.You talk out your ass better than most people do using their mouth and sober.Thank you, Holden finally said.I love you guys.You know that, right?Plus which, Amos continued, no one on this ship will try harder to jump in front of a bullet for me than you will.I find that appealing in a captain.Thanks, Holden said again.Sounds settled to me, Alex said, getting up and heading toward the ladder.Gonna go make sure were not aimed at a rock or somethin.Holden watched him go and was gratified to see him wiping his eyes as soon as he got out of the room.It was okay to be a weepy little kid as long as everyone else was being a weepy little kid.Prax gave him an awkward pat on the shoulder and said, Come back to the galley in an hour.Pudding will be ready.Then he wandered out and into his cabin.He was already reading messages on his hand terminal as he closed the door.Okay, Amos said.What now?Amos, Naomi said, getting up and walking over to stand in front of Holden.Please take ops for me for a while.Roger that, Amos said, the grin existing only in his voice.He climbed the ladder up and out of sight, the pressure hatch opening for him, then slamming behind him when he went.Hi, Holden said.Was that right?She nodded.I feel like I got you back.I was worried Id never see you again.If you hadnt yanked me out of that hole I was digging for myself, neither of us would have.Naomi leaned forward to kiss him, and he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her tight.When they stopped to breathe, he said, Is this too soon?She said, Shut up, and kissed him again.Without breaking the kiss, she pulled her body away from his and began fumbling with the zipper of his jumpsuit.Those ridiculous Martian military jumpsuits that had come with the ship, TACHI stenciled across the back.Now that they were going to have their own company, theyd need to get something better.Jumpsuits made a lot of sense for shipboard life, with changing gravities and oily mechanical parts.But something actually tailored to fit them all, and in their own colors.ROCINANTE on the back.Naomis hand got inside the jumpsuit and under his T shirt, and he lost all thought of fashion choices.My bunk or yours?he said.You have your own bunk?Not anymore.Making love to Naomi had always been different than with anyone else.Some of it was physical.She was the only Belter hed ever been with, and that meant she was physiologically different in some ways.But that wasnt the most notable part for him.What made Naomi different was that theyd been friends for five years before theyd slept together.It wasnt a flattering testament to his character, and it made him cringe when he thought about it now, but hed always been pretty shallow when it came to sex.Hed picked out potential sexual partners within minutes of meeting a new woman, and because he was pretty and charming, he usually got the ones he was interested in.Hed always been quick to allow himself to mistake infatuation for genuine affection.One of his most painful memories was the day Naomi had called him on it.Exposed for him the little game he played in which he convinced himself he genuinely cared for the women he was sleeping with so that he wouldnt feel like a user.But he had been.The fact that the women were using him in turn didnt make him feel better about it.Because Naomi was so physically different from the ideal that growing up on Earth had created, he had just not seen her as a potential sexual partner when theyd first met.And that meant hed grown to know her as a person without any of the sexual baggage he usually carried.When his feelings for her grew beyond friendship, he was surprised.And somehow, that changed everything about sex.The movements might all be the same, but the desire to communicate affection rather than demonstrate prowess changed what everything meant.After their first time together, hed lain in bed for hours feeling like hed been doing it wrong for years and only just realized it.He was doing that again now.Naomi slept on her side next to him, her arm thrown across his chest and her thigh across his, her belly against his hip and her breast against his ribs.It had never been like this with anyone before her, and this was what it was supposed to be like.This sense of complete ease and contentment.He could imagine a future in which he hadnt been able to prove hed changed, and in which she never came back to him.He could see years and decades of sexual partners, always trying to recapture this feeling and never being able to because, of course, it wasnt really about the sex.Thinking about it made his stomach hurt.Naomi talked in her sleep.Her mouth whispered something mysterious into his neck, and the sudden tickle woke him up enough to realize hed been drifting off to sleep.He hugged her head to his chest and kissed the top of it, then rolled over onto his side and let himself fade.The wall monitor over the bed buzzed.Who is it?he said, suddenly as tired as he could remember ever having been.Hed just closed his eyes a second earlier, and he knew hed never be able to open them now.Me, Cap, Alex said.Holden wanted to shout at him but couldnt find the energy.Okay.You need to see this, was all Alex said, but something in his voice woke Holden up.He sat up, moving Naomis arm out of the way.She said something in sleep talk but didnt wake.Okay, he said again, turning on the monitor.A white haired older woman with very strange facial features looked out at him.It took his addled mind a second to recognize that she wasnt deformed, just being crushed by a heavy burn.With a voice distorted by g forces mashing down on her throat, she said, My name is Chrisjen Avasarala.Im the UN assistant undersecretary of executive administration.A UN admiral has dispatched six Munroe class destroyers from the Jupiter system to destroy your ship.Track this transponder code and come meet me or you and everyone on your ship will die.This is not a fucking joke.Forty: Prax  Thrust pressed him into the crash couch.It was only four g, but even a single full g called for very nearly the full medical cocktail.He had lived in a place that kept him weak.Hed known that, of course, but mostly in terms of xylem and phloem.He had taken the normal low g medical supplements to encourage bone growth.He had exercised as much as the guidelines asked.Usually.But always in the back of his mind, hed thought it was idiocy.He was a botanist.Hed live and die in the familiar tunnels, with their comfortable low gravity less than a fifth of Earths.An Earth he would never have reason to go to.There was even less reason he would ever need to suffer through a high g burn.And yet here he lay in the gel like he was at the bottom of an ocean.His vision was blurred, and he fought for every inhalation.When his knee hyper extended, he tried to scream but couldnt catch his breath.The others would be better.Theyd be used to things like this.They knew that theyd survive.His hindbrain wasnt at all sure.Needles dug into the flesh of his thigh, injecting him with another cocktail of hormones and paralytics.Cold like the touch of ice spread from the injection points, and a paradoxical sense of ease and dread filled his mind.At this point, it was a balancing act between keeping his blood vessels elastic enough that they wouldnt burst and robust enough that they wouldnt collapse.His mind slid out from under him, leaving something calculating and detached in its place.It was like pure executive function without a sense of self.What had been his mind knew what he had known, remembered the things he remembered, but wasnt him.In this altered state of consciousness, he found himself taking inventory.Would it be okay to die now?Did he want to live, and if he did, on what terms?He considered the loss of his daughter as if it were a physical object.Loss was the soft pink of crushed sea shell, where once it had been the red of old, scabby blood.The red of an umbilical cord waiting to drop free.He remembered Mei, what she had looked like.The delight in her laugh.She wasnt like that anymore.If she was alive.But she was probably dead.In his gravity bent mind, he smiled.Of course, his lips couldnt react.Hed been wrong.All along, hed been wrong.The hours of sitting by himself, telling himself that Mei was dead.Hed thought he was toughening himself.Preparing himself for the worst.That wasnt right at all.Hed said it, hed tried to believe it, because the thought was comforting.If she was dead, she wasnt being tortured.If she was dead, she wasnt scared.If she was dead, then the pain would be all his, entirely his, and she would be safe.He noticed without pleasure or pain that it was a pathological mental frame.But hed had his life and his daughter taken from him, had survived in near starvation while the cascade effect ate what was left of Ganymede, had been shot at, had faced a half alien killing machine, and was now known throughout the solar system as a wife beater and pedophile.He had no reason to be sane.It wouldnt help him.And on top of that, his knee really hurt.Somewhere far, far away, in a place with light and air, something buzzed three times, and the mountain rolled off his sternum.Coming back to himself was like rising from the bottom of a pool.Okay, yall, Alex said across the ships system.Were callin this dinner.Take a couple minutes for your livers to crawl up off your spinal cords, and well meet up in the galley.Weve only got fifty minutes, so enjoy it while you can.Prax took a deep breath, blowing it out between his teeth, and then sat up.His whole body felt bruised.His hand terminal claimed the thrust was at one third g, but it felt like more and less than that.He swung his legs over the edge, and his knee made a wet, grinding pop.He tapped at his terminal.Um, Im not sure I can walk, he said.My knee.Hang tight, Doc.Amos voice came from the speaker.Ill come take a look at it.Im pretty much the closest thing weve got to a medic unless you wanna hand it over to the med bay.Just dont try to weld him back together, Holden said.It doesnt work.The link went silent.While he waited, Prax checked his incoming messages.The list was too long for the screen, but that had been true since the initial message had gone out.The message titles had changed.BABY RAPERS SHOULD BE TORTURED TO DEATH DONT LISTEN TO THE HATERS I BELIEVE YOU MY FATHER DID THE SAME THING TO ME TURN TO JESUS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE  He didnt open them.He checked the newsfeeds under his own name and Meis and had seven thousand active feeds with those keywords.Nicolas only had fifty.There had been a time that hed loved Nicola, or thought that he had.Hed wanted to have sex with her as badly as hed wanted anything before in his life.He told himself there had been good times.Nights theyd spent together.Mei had come from Nicolas body.It was hard to believe that something so precious and central to his life had also been part of a woman who, by the evidence, hed never really known.Even as the father of her child, he hadnt known the woman who could have made that recording.He opened the hand terminals recording fields, centered the camera on himself, and licked his lips.Nicola  Twenty seconds later, he closed the field and erased the recording.He had nothing to say.Who are you, and who do you think I am?came closest, and he didnt care about the answer to either one.He went back to the messages, filtering on the names of the people whod been helping him investigate.There was nothing new since the last time.Hey, Doc, Amos said, lumbering into the small room.Im sorry, Prax said, putting his terminal back into its holder beside the crash couch.It was just that during that last burn  He gestured to his knee.It was swollen, but not as badly as hed expected.Hed thought it would be twice its normal size, but the anti inflammatories that had been injected into his veins were doing their job.Amos nodded, put a hand on Praxs sternum, and pushed him back into the gel.I got a toe that pops out sometimes, Amos said.Little tiny joint, but get it at the wrong angle on a fast burn, hurts like a bitch.Try not to tense up, Doc.Amos bent the knee twice, feeling the joint grind.This aint that bad.Here, straighten it out.Okay.Amos wrapped one hand around Praxs ankle, braced the other on the frame of the couch, and pulled slowly and irresistibly.Praxs knee bloomed with pain, and then a deep, wet pop and a nauseating sensation of tendons shifting against bone.There you go, Amos said.We go back into burn, make sure you got that leg in the right place.Hyperextend that again right now, well pop your kneecap off, okay?Right, Prax said, starting to sit up.Im sorry as hell to do this, Doc, Amos said, putting a hand on his chest, pushing him back down.I mean, youre having a lousy day and all.But you know how it is.Prax frowned.Every muscle in his face felt bruised.What is it?All this bullshit theyre saying about you and the kid?Thats all just bullshit, right?Of course, Prax said.Because you know, sometimes things happen, you didnt even mean them to.Have a hard day, lose your temper, maybe?Or shit, you get drunk.Some of the things Ive done when I really tied one on?I dont even know about until later.Amos smiled.Im just saying if theres a grain of truth, something thats getting all exaggerated, itd be better if we knew it now, right?I never did anything that she said.Its okay to tell me the truth, Doc.I understand.Sometimes guys do stuff.Doesnt make em bad.Prax pushed Amos hand aside and brought himself up to sitting.His knee felt much better.Actually, he said, it does.That makes them bad.Amos expression relaxed, his smile changed in a way Prax couldnt quite understand.All right, Doc.Like I said, Im sorry as hell.But I did have to ask.Its okay, Prax said, standing up.For a moment, the knee seemed like it might give, but it didnt.Prax took a tentative step, then another.It would work.He turned toward the galley, but the conversation wasnt finished.If I had.If I had done those things, that would have been okay with you?Oh, fuck no.Id have broken your neck and thrown you out the airlock, Amos said, clapping him on the shoulder.Ah, Prax said, a gentle relief loosening in his chest.Thank you.Anytime.The other three were in the galley when Prax and Amos got there, but it still felt half full.Less.Naomi and Alex were sitting across the table from each other.Neither of them looked as ruined as Prax felt.Holden turned from the wall with a formed foam bowl in either hand.The brown slurry in them smelled of heat and earth and cooked leaves.As soon as it caught his nose, Prax was ravenous.Lentil soup?Holden asked as Prax and Amos sat on either side of Alex.That would be wonderful, Prax said.Ill just take a tube of goo, Amos said.Lentils give me gas, and I cant see popping an intestine next time we accelerate being fun for anyone.Holden put a fresh bowl in front of Prax and handed a white tube with a black plastic nipple to Amos, then sat beside Naomi.They didnt touch, but the connection between them was unmistakable.He wondered whether Mei had ever wanted him to reconcile with Nicola.Impossible now.Okay, Alex, Holden said.Whatve we got?Same thing we had before, Alex said.Six destroyers burning like hell toward us.A matching force burning after them, and a racing pinnace heading away from us on the other side.Wait, Prax said.Away from us?Theyre matching our course.Already did the turnaround, and theyre getting up to speed to join us.Prax closed his eyes, picturing the vectors.Were almost there, then?he said.Very nearly, Alex said.Eighteen, twenty hours.Hows it going to play out?Are the Earth ships going to catch us?Theyre gonna catch the hell out of us, Alex said, but not before we get that pinnace.Call it four days after, maybe.Prax took a spoonful of the soup.It tasted just as good as it smelled.Green, dark leaves were mixed in with the lentils, and he spread one open with his spoon, trying to identify it.Spinach, maybe.The stem margin didnt look quite right, but it had been cooked, after all  How sure are we this isnt a trap?Amos asked.We arent, Holden said.But I dont see how it would work.If they want us in custody instead of dead, Naomi suggested.We are talking about opening our airlock for someone way high up in the Earth government.So she is who she says she is?Prax asked.Looks like it, Holden said.Alex raised a hand.Well, if its talk to some little gramma from the UN or get my ass shot off by six destroyers, Im thinkin we can break out the cookies and tea, right?It would be late in the game to go for another plan, Naomi said.It makes me damn uncomfortable having Earth saving me from Earth, though.Structures are never monolithic, Prax said.Theres more genetic variation within Belters or Martians or Earthers than there is between them.Evolution would predict some divisions within the group structures and alliances with out members.You see the same thing in ferns.Ferns?Naomi asked.Ferns can be very aggressive, Prax said.A soft chime interrupted them: three rising notes, like bells gently struck.Okay, suck it down, Alex said.Thats the fifteen minute warning.Amos made a prodigious sucking sound, the white tube withering at his lips.Prax put down his spoon and lifted the soup bowl to his lips, not wanting to leave a drop of it.Holden did the same, then started gathering up the used bowls.Anyone needs to hit the head, this is the time, he said.Well talk again in  Eight hours, Alex said.Eight hours, Holden repeated.Prax felt his chest go tight.Another round of crushing acceleration.Hours of the couchs needles propping up his failing metabolism.It sounded like hell.He rose from the table, nodded to everyone, and went back to his bunk.His knee was much better.He hoped it would still be when he next got up.The ten minute chime sounded.He lay down on the couch, trying to align his body perfectly, then waited.Waited.He rolled over and grabbed his hand terminal.Seven new incoming messages.Two of them supportive, three hateful, one addressed to the wrong person, and one a financial statement from the charity fund.He didnt bother reading them.He turned on the camera.Nicola, he said.I dont know what they told you.I dont know if you really think all those things that you said.But I know I never touched you in anger, even at the end.And if you really felt afraid of me, I dont know why it was.Mei is the one thing that I love more than anything in life.Id die before I let anyone hurt her.And now half the solar system thinks I hurt her  He stopped the recording and began again.Nicola.Honestly, I didnt think we had anything left between us to betray.He stopped.The five minute warning chimed as he ran his fingers through his hair.Each individual follicle ached.He wondered if this was why Amos kept his head shaved.There were so many things about being on a ship that didnt occur to you until you were actually there.Nicola  He erased all the recordings and logged into the charity bank account interface.There was a secure request format that could encrypt and send an authorized transfer as soon as light speed delivered it to the banks computers.He filled it all out quickly.The two minute warning sounded, louder and more insistent.With thirty seconds left, he sent her money back.There was nothing else for them to say.He put the hand terminal in place and lay back.The computer counted backward from twenty, and the mountain rolled back over him.Hows the knee?Amos asked.Pretty good, Prax said.I was surprised.I thought thered be more damage.Didnt hyperextend this time, Amos said.Did okay with my toe too.A deep tone rang through the ship, and the deck shifted under Prax.Holden, standing just to Praxs right, moved the rifle to his left hand and touched a control panel.Alex?Yeah, it was little rough.Sorry about that, but Hold on.Yeah, Cap.Weve got seal.And theyre knocking.Holden shifted the rifle back to his other hand.Amos also had a weapon at the ready.Naomi stood beside him, nothing in her hands but a terminal linked to ship operations.If something went wrong, being able to control ship functions might be more useful than a gun.They all wore the articulated armor of the Martian military that had come with the ship.The paired ships were accelerating at a third of a g.  The Earth destroyers still barreled down toward them.So Im guessing the firearms mean youre thinking trap, Capn?Amos asked.Nothing wrong with an honor guard, Holden said.Prax held up his hand.You dont ever get one again, Holden said.No offense.No, I was just I thought honor guards were usually on the same side as the people theyre guarding?We may be stretching the definitions a little here, Naomi said.Her voice had just a trace of tension in it.Shes just a little old politician, Holden said.And that pinnace cant hold more than two people.Weve got her outnumbered.And if things get ugly, Alex is watching from the pilots seat.You are watching, right?Oh yeah, Alex said.So if there are any surprises, Naomi can pop us loose and Alex can get us out of here.That wont help with the destroyers, though, Prax said.Naomi put a hand on his arm, squeezing him gently.Im not sure youre helping, Prax.The outer airlock cycled open with a distant hum.The lights clicked from red to green.Whoa, Alex said.Problem?Holden snapped.No, its just   The inner door opened, and the biggest person Prax had seen in his entire life stepped into the room wearing a suit of some sort of strength augmenting armor.If it werent for the transparent faceplate, he would have thought it was a two meter tall bipedal robot.Through the faceplate, Prax saw a womans features: large dark eyes and coffee with cream skin.Her gaze raked them with the palpable threat of violence.Beside him, Amos took an unconscious step back.Youre the captain, the woman said, the suits speakers making her voice sound artificial and amplified.It didnt sound like a question.I am, Holden said.Ive got to say, you looked a little different on screen.The joke fell flat and the giant stepped into the room.Planning to shoot me with that?she asked, pointing toward Holdens gun with a massive gauntleted fist.Would it work?Probably not, the giant said.She took another small step forward, her armor whining when she moved.Holden and Amos took a matching step back.Call it an honor guard, then, Holden said.Im honored.Will you put them away now?sure.Two minutes later, the guns were stowed, and the huge woman, who still hadnt given her name, tapped something inside the helmet with her chin and said, Okay.Youre clear.The airlock cycled again, red to green, with the hum of the opening doors.The woman who came in this time was smaller than any of them.Her gray hair was spiking out in all directions, and the orange sari she wore hung strangely in the low thrust gravity.Undersecretary Avasarala, Holden said.Welcome aboard.If theres anything I can   Youre Naomi Nagata, the wizened little woman said.Holden and Naomi exchanged glances, and Naomi shrugged.I am.How the fuck do you keep your hair like that?I look like a hedgehogs been humping my skull.Um   Looking the part is half of whats going to keep you all alive.We dont have time to screw around.Nagata, you get me looking pretty and girlish.Holden   Im an engineer, not a damned hairstylist, Naomi said, anger creeping into her voice.Maam, Holden said, this is my ship and my crew.Half of us arent even Earth citizens, and we dont just take your commands.All right.Ms.Nagata, if were going to keep this ship from turning into an expanding ball of hot gas, we need to make a press statement, and Im not prepared to do that.Would you please assist me?Okay, Naomi said.Thank you.And, Captain?You need a fucking shave.Forty One: Avasarala  A fter the Guanshiyin, the Rocinante seemed dour, mean, and utilitarian.There was no plush carpeting, only fabric covered foam to soften corners and angles where soldiers might be thrown when the ship maneuvered violently.Instead of cinnamon and honey, the air had the plastic and heat smell of military air recyclers.And there were no expansive desk, no wide solitaire ready bed, and no private space apart from a captains lounge the size of a public toilet stall.Most of the footage theyd taken had been in the cargo bays, angled so that no ammunition or weaponry was in the image.Someone who knew Martian military vessels could tell where they were.To everyone else, it would be an open space with cargo crates in the background.Naomi Nagata had helped put the release together she was a surprisingly good visual editor and when it became clear that none of the men could manage a professional sounding voice over, shed done that too.The crew assembled in the medical bay, where the mechanic Amos Burton had changed the feed to display from her hand terminal.Now he was sitting on one of the patient beds, his legs crossed, smiling amiably.If Avasarala hadnt seen the intelligence files on Holdens crew, shed never have guessed what the man was capable of.The others were spread out in a rough semicircle.Bobbie was sitting beside Alex Kamal, the Martians unconsciously grouping together.Praxidike Meng stood at the back of the room.Avasarala couldnt tell if her presence made him uncomfortable or if he was always like that.Okay, she said.Last chance for feedback.Wish I had some popcorn, Amos said, and the medical scanner flashed once, showed a broadcast code and then white block letters: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.Avasarala and Holden appeared on the screen.She was speaking, her hands out before her as if illustrating a point.Holden, looking sober, leaned toward her.Naomi Nagatas voice was calm, strong, and professional.In a surprising development, the deputy to Undersecretary of Executive Administration Sadavir Errinwright met with OPA representative James Holden and a representative of the Martian military today to address concerns over the potentially earth shattering revelations surrounding the devastating attack on Ganymede.The image cut to Avasarala.She was leaning forward to make her neck longer and hide the loose skin under her chin.Long practice made her look natural, but she could almost hear Arjun laughing.A runner at the bottom of the screen identified her by name and title.I expect to be traveling with Captain Holden to the Jovian system, Avasarala said.The United Nations of Earth feel very strongly that a multilateral investigation into this is the best way to restore balance and peace to the system.The image shifted to Holden and Avasarala sitting in the galley with the botanist.This time the little scientist was talking and she and Holden pretended to listen.The voice over came again.When asked about the accusations leveled against Praxidike Meng, whose search for his daughter has become the human face of the tragedy on Ganymede, the Earth delegation was unequivocal.Then back to Avasarala, her expression now sorrowful.Her head shaking in an almost subliminal negation.Nicola Mulko is a tragic figure in this, and I personally condemn the irresponsibility of these raw newsfeeds that allow statements from mentally ill people to be presented as if they were verified fact.Her abandonment of her husband and child is beyond dispute, and her struggles with her psychological issues deserve a more dignified and private venue.From off camera, Nagata asked, So you blame the media?Absolutely, Avasarala said as the image shifted to a picture of a toddler with smiling black eyes and dark pigtails.We have absolute faith in Dr.Mengs love and dedication to Mei, and we are pleased to be part of the effort to bring her safely home.The recording ended.All right, Avasarala said.Any comments?I dont actually work for the OPA anymore, Holden said.Im not authorized to represent the Martian military, Bobbie said.Im not even sure Im still supposed to be working with you.Thank you for that.Are there any comments that matter?Avasarala asked.There was a moments silence.Worked for me, Praxidike Meng said.There was one way that the Rocinante was infinitely more expansive than the Guanshiyin, and it was the only one that she cared about.The tightbeam was hers.Lag was worse and every hour took her farther from Earth, but knowing that the messages she sent were getting off the ship without being reported to Nguyen and Errinwright gave her the feeling of breathing free.What happened once they reached Earth, she couldnt control, but that was always true.That was the game.Admiral Souther looked tired, but on the small screen it was hard to tell much more than that.Youve kicked the beehive, Chrisjen, he said.Its looking an awful lot like you just made yourself a human shield for a bunch of folks that dont work for us.And Im guessing that was the plan.I did what you asked, and yes, Nguyen took meetings with Jules Pierre Mao.First one was just after his testimony on Protogen.And yes, Errinwright knew about them.But that doesnt mean very much.Ive met with Mao.Hes a snake, but if you stopped dealing with men like him, you wouldnt have much left to do.The smear campaign against your scientist friend came out of the executive office, which, Ive got to say, makes a damn lot of us over here in the armed forces a bit twitchy.Starts looking like theres divisions inside the leadership, and it gets a little murky whose orders were supposed to be following.If it gets there, our friend Errinwright still outranks you.Him or the secretary general comes to me with a direct order, Im going to have to have a hell of a good reason to think its illegal.This whole thing smells like skunk, but I dont have that reason yet.You know what Im saying.The recording stopped.Avasarala pressed her fingers to her lips.She understood.She didnt like it, but she understood.She levered herself up from her couch.Her joints still ached from the race to the Rocinante, and the way the ship would sometimes shift beneath her, course corrections moving gravity a degree or two, left her vaguely nauseated.Shed made it this far.The corridor that led to the galley was short, but it had a bend just before it entered.The voices carried well enough that Avasarala walked softly.The low Martian drawl was the pilot, and Bobbies vowels and timbre were unmistakable.that tellin the captain where to stand and how to look.I thought Amos was going to toss her in the airlock a couple of times.He could try, Bobbie said.And you work for her?I dont know who the hell I work for anymore.I think Im still pulling a salary from Mars, but all my dailies are out of her office budget.Ive pretty much been playing it all as it comes.Sounds rough.Im a marine, Bobbie said, and Avasarala paused.The tone was wrong.It was calm, almost relaxed.Almost at peace.That was interesting.Does anyone actually like her?the pilot asked.No, Bobbie said almost before the question was done being asked.Oh hell no.And she keeps it like that.That shit she pulled with Holden, marching on his ship and ordering him around like she owned it?Shes always like that.The secretary general?She calls him a bobble head to his face.And whats with the potty mouth?Part of her charm, Bobbie said.The pilot chuckled, and there was a little slurp as he drank something.I may have misunderstood politics, he said.And a moment later: You like her?I do.Mind if I ask why?We care about the same things, Bobbie said, and the thoughtful note in her voice made Avasarala feel uncomfortable eavesdropping.She cleared her throat and walked into the galley.Wheres Holden?she asked.Probably sleeping, the pilot said.The way weve been keepin the ships cycle, its about two in the morning.Ah, Avasarala said.For her, it was mid afternoon.That was going to be a little awkward.Everything in her life seemed to be about lag right now, waiting for the messages to get through the vast blackness of the vacuum.But at least she could prepare.Im going to want a meeting with everyone on board as soon as theyre up, she said.Bobbie, youll need your formal wear again.It took Bobbie only a few seconds to understand.Youll show them the monster, she said.And then were going to sit here and talk until we figure out what exactly it is they know on this ship.It has the bad guys worried enough they were willing to send their boys to kill them, she said.Yeah, about that, the pilot said.Those destroyers cut back to a cruising acceleration, but they arent turning back yet.Doesnt matter, Avasarala said.Everybody knows Im on this ship.No ones going to shoot at it.In the local morning and Avasaralas subjective early evening, the crew gathered again.Rather than bring the whole powered suit into the galley, shed copied the stored video and given it to Naomi.The crew members were bright and well rested apart from the pilot, who had stayed up entirely too late talking to Bobbie, and the botanist, who looked like he might just be permanently exhausted.Im not supposed to show this to anyone, Avasarala said, looking pointedly at Holden.But on this ship, right now, I think we all need to put our cards on the table.And Im willing to go first.This is the attack on Ganymede.The thing that started it all off.Naomi?Naomi started the playback, and Bobbie turned away and stared at the bulkhead.Avasarala didnt watch it either, her attention on the faces of the others.As the blood and carnage played out behind her, she studied them and learned a little more about the people she was dealing with.The engineer, Amos, watched with the calm reserve of a professional killer.No surprise there.At first Holden, Naomi, and Alex were horrified, and she watched as Alex and Naomi slid into a kind of shock.There were tears in the pilots eyes.Holden, on the other hand, curled in.His shoulders bent outward from each other, and an expression of banked rage smoldered in his eyes and around the corners of his mouth.That was interesting.Bobbie wept openly with her back to the screen, and her expression was melancholy, like a woman at a funeral.A memorial service.Praxidike everyone else called him Prax was the only one who seemed almost happy.When at the segments end, the monstrosity detonated, he clapped his hands and squealed in pleasure.That was it, he said.You were right, Alex.Did you see how it was starting to grow more limbs?Catastrophic restraint failure.It was a fail safe.Okay, Avasarala said.Why dont you try that again with an antecedent.What was a fail safe?The other protomolecule form ejected the explosive device from its body before it could detonate.You see, these things protomolecule soldiers or whatever are breaking their programming, and I think Merrian knows about it.He hasnt found a way to stop it, because the constraints fail.Whos Marion, and what does she have to do with anything?Avasarala said.You wanted more nouns, Gramma, Amos said.Let me take this from the top, Holden said, and recounted the attack by the stowaway beast, the damage to the cargo door, Praxs scheme to lure it out of the ship and reduce it to its component atoms with the drives exhaust.Avasarala handed over the data she had about the energy spikes on Venus, and Prax grabbed that data, looking it over while talking about his determination of a secret base on Io where the things were being produced.It left Avasaralas head spinning.And they took your kid there, Avasarala said.They took all of them, Prax said.Why would they do that?Because they dont have immune systems, Prax said.And so theyd be easier to reshape with the protomolecule.There would be fewer physiological systems fighting against the new cellular constraints, and the soldiers would probably last a lot longer.Jesus, Doc, Amos said.Theyre going to turn Mei into one of those fucking things?Probably, Prax said, frowning.I only just figured that out.But why do it at all?Holden said.It doesnt make sense.In order to sell them to a military force as a first strike weapon, Avasarala said.To consolidate power before well, before the fucking apocalypse.Point of clarification, Alex said, raising his hand.We have an apocalypse comin?Was that a thing we knew about?Venus, Avasarala said.Oh.That apocalypse, Alex said, lowering his hand.Right.Soldiers that can travel without ships, Naomi said.You could fire them off at high g for a little while, then cut engines and let them go ballistic.How would you find them?But it wont work, Prax said.Remember?They escape constraint.And since they can share information, theyre going to get harder to hold to any kind of new programming.The room went silent.Prax looked confused.They can share information?Avasarala said.Sure, Prax said.Look at your energy spikes.The first one happened while the thing was fighting Bobbie and the other marines on Ganymede.The second spike came when the other one got loose in the lab.The third spike was when we killed it with the Rocinante.Every time one of them has been attacked, Venus reacted.Theyre networked.Id assume that any critical information could be shared.Like how to escape constraints.If they use them against people, Holden said, there wont be any way to stop them.Theyll ditch the fail safe bombs and just keep going.The battles wont end.Um.No, Prax said.Thats not the problem.Its the cascade again.Once the protomolecule gets a little freedom, it has more tools to erode other constraints, which gets it more tools to erode more constraints and on and on like that.The original program or something like it will eventually swamp the new program.Theyll revert.Bobbie leaned forward, her head canted a few degrees to the right.Her voice was quiet, but it had a threat of violence that was louder than shouting.So if they set those things loose on Mars, they stay soldiers like the first one for a while.And then they start dropping the bombs out like your guy did.And then they turn Mars into Eros?Well, worse than Eros, Prax said.Any decent sized Martian city is going to have an order of magnitude more people than Eros did.The room was quiet.On the monitor, Bobbies suit camera looked up at star filled sky while battleships killed each other in orbit.Ive got to send some messages out, Avasarala said.These half human things youve made?They arent your servants.You cant control them, Avasarala said.Jules Pierre Mao sold you a bill of goods.I know why you kept me out of this, and I think youre a fucking moron for it, but put it aside.It doesnt matter now.Just do not pull that fucking trigger.Do you understand what Im saying?Dont.You will be personally responsible for the single deadliest screwup in the history of humankind, and Im on a ship with Jim fucking Holden, so the bars not low.The full recording clocked in at almost half an hour.The security footage from the Rocinante with its stowaway was attached.A fifteen minute lecture by Prax had to be scrapped when he reached the part about his daughter being turned into a protomolecule soldier, and this time broke into uncontrollable weeping.Avasarala did her best to recapitulate it, but she wasnt at all certain she had the details right.Shed considered bringing Jon Michael into it, but decided against it.Better to keep it in the family.She sent the message.If she knew Errinwright, he wouldnt get back to her immediately.There would be an hour or two of evaluation, weighing what shed said, and then when shed been left to stew for a while, hed reply.She hoped hed be sane about it.He had to.She needed to sleep.She could feel the fatigue gnawing at the edges of her mind, slowing her, but when she lay down, rest felt as far away as home.As Arjun.She thought about recording a message for him, but it would only have left her feeling more powerfully isolated.After an hour, she pulled herself up and walked through the halls.Her body told her it was midnight or later, and the activity on board music ringing out of the machine shop, a loud conversation between Holden and Alex about the maintenance of the electronics systems, even Praxidikes sitting in the galley by himself, apparently grooming a box of hydroponics cuttings had a surreal late night feeling.She considered sending another message to Souther.The lag time would be much less to him, and she was hungry enough for a response that anything would do.When the answer came, it wasnt a message.Captain, Alex said over the ship wide comm.You should come up to ops and look at this.Something in his voice told Avasarala that this wasnt a maintenance question.She found the lift to ops just as Holden went up, and pulled herself up the ladder rather than wait.She wasnt the only one whod followed the call.Bobbie was in a spare seat, her eyes on the same screen as Holdens.The blinking tactical data scrolled down the screen, and a dozen bright red dots displayed changes.She didnt understand most of what she saw, but the gist was obvious.The destroyers were on the move.Okay, Holden said.Whatre we seeing?All the Earth destroyers hit high burn.Six g, Alex said.Are they going to Io?Oh, hell no.This was Errinwrights answer.No messages.No negotiations.Not even an acknowledgment that shed asked him to restrain himself.Warships.The despair only lasted for a moment.Then came the anger.Bobbie?Yeah.That part where you told me I didnt understand the danger I was in?And you told me that I didnt how the game was played.That part.I remember.What about it?If you wanted to say I told you so, this looks like the right time.Forty Two: Holden  Holden had spent a month at the Diamond Head Electronic Warfare Lab on Oahu as his first posting after officer candidate school.During that time, hed learned he had no desire to be a naval intelligence wonk, really disliked poi, and really liked Polynesian women.Hed been far too busy at the time to actively chase one, but hed thoroughly enjoyed spending his few spare moments down at the beach looking at them.Hed had a thing for curvy women with long black hair ever since.The Martian Marine was like one of those cute little beach bunnies that someone had used editing software on and blown up to 150 percent normal size.The proportions, the black hair, the dark eyes, everything was the same.Only, giant.It short circuited his neural wiring.The lizard living at the back of his brain kept jumping back and forth between Mate with it!and Flee from it!What was worse, she knew it.She seemed to have sized him up and decided he was only worth a tired smirk within moments of their meeting.Do you need me to go over it again?she said, the smirk mocking him.They were sitting together in the galley, where shed been describing for him the Martian intelligence on the best way to engage the Munroe class light destroyer.No!he wanted to yell.I heard you.Im not a freak.I have a lovely girlfriend that Im totally committed to, so stop treating me like some kind of bumbling teenage boy whos trying to look down your dress!But then hed look up at her again, and his hindbrain would start bouncing back and forth between attraction and fear, and his language centers would start misfiring.Again.No, he said, staring at the neatly organized list of bullet points shed forwarded to his hand terminal.I think this information is very informative.He saw the smirk widen out of the corner of his eye and focused more intently on the list.Okay, Bobbie said.Im going to go catch some rack time.With your permission, of course.Captain.Permission granted, Holden said.Of course.Go.Rack.She pushed herself to her feet without touching the arms of the chair.Shed grown up in Martian gravity.She had to mass a hundred kilos at one g, easy.She was showing off.He pretended to ignore it, and she left the galley.Shes something, isnt she?Avasarala said, coming into the galley and collapsing into the recently vacated chair.Holden looked up at her and saw a different kind of smirk.One that said the old lady saw right through him to the warring lizards at the back of his head.But she wasnt a giant Polynesian woman, so he could vent his frustration on her.Yeah, shes a peach, he said.But were still going to die.What?When those destroyers catch us, which they will, we are going to die.The only reason they arent raining torpedoes down on us already is because they know our PDC network can take out anything fired at this range.Avasarala leaned back in her chair with a heavy sigh, and the smirk shifted into a tired but genuine smile.I dont suppose theres any chance you could find an old woman a cup of tea, could you?Holden shook his head.Im sorry.No tea drinkers on the crew.Lots of coffee, though, if youd like a cup.Im actually tired enough to do that.Lots of cream, lots of sugar.How about, Holden said, pulling her a cup, lots of sugar, lots of a powder thats called whitener.Sounds like piss.Ill take it.Holden sat down and pushed the sweetened and whitened cup of coffee across to her.She took it and grimaced through several long swallows.Explain, she said after another drink, everything you just said.Those destroyers are going to kill us, Holden repeated.The sergeant says you refuse to believe that UN ships will fire on you, but I agree with her.Thats naive.Okay, but whats a PDC network?Holden tried not to frown.Hed expected any number of things from the woman, but ignorance hadnt been one.Point defense cannons.If those destroyers fire torpedoes at us from this distance, the targeting computer for the PDCs wont have any trouble shooting them down.So theyll wait until they get close enough that they can overwhelm us.I give it three days before they start.I see, Avasarala said.And whats your plan?Holden barked out a laugh with no humor in it.Plan?My plan is to die in a ball of superheated plasma.There is literally no way that a single fast attack corvette, which is us, can successfully fight six light destroyers.We arent in the same weight class as even one of them, but against one, a lucky shot maybe.Against six?No chance.We die.Ive read your file, Avasarala said.You faced down a UN corvette during the Eros incident.Yeah, one corvette.We were a match for her.And I got her to back down by threatening the unarmed science ship she was escorting.This isnt even remotely the same thing.So what does the infamous James Holden do at his last stand?He was silent for a while.He rats, Holden said.We know whats going on.We have all the pieces now.Mao Kwik, the protomolecule monsters, where theyre taking the kids everything.We put all the data in a file and broadcast it to the universe.They can still kill us if they want to, but we can make it a pointless act of revenge.Keep it from actually helping them.No, Avasarala said.Uh, no?You might be forgetting whose ship youre on.Im sorry, did I seem to give a fuck that this is your ship?If I did, really, I was just being polite, Avasarala said, giving him a withering glare.You arent going to fuck up the whole solar system just because youre a one trick pony.We have bigger fish to fry.Holden counted to ten in his head and said, Your idea is?Send it to these two UN admirals, she said, then tapped something on her terminal.His buzzed with the received file.Souther and Leniki.Mostly Souther.I dont like Leniki, and he hasnt been in the loop on this, but hes a decent backup.You want my last act before being killed by a UN admiral to be sending all of the vital information I have to a UN admiral.Avasarala leaned back into her chair and rubbed her temples with her fingertips.Holden waited.Im tired, she said after a few moments.And I miss my husband.Its like an ache in my arms that I cant hold him right now.Do you know what thats like?I know exactly what that ache feels like.So I want you to understand that Im sitting here, right now, coming to terms with the idea that I wont see him again.Or my grandchildren.Or my daughter.My doctors said I probably had a good thirty years left in me.Time to watch my grandkids grow up, maybe even see a great grandchild or two.But instead, Im going to be killed by a limp dick, whiny sonofabitch like Admiral Nguyen.Holden could feel the massive weight of those six destroyers bearing down on them, murder in their hearts.It felt like having a pistol pushed into his ribs from behind.He wanted to shake the old woman and tell her to hurry up.She smiled at him.My last act in this universe isnt going to be fucking up everything I did right up to now.Holden made a conscious effort to ignore his frustration.He got up and opened the refrigerator.Hey, theres leftover pudding.Want some?Ive read your psych profile.I know all about your everyone should know everything naive bullshit.But how much of the last war was your fault, with your goddamned endless pirate broadcasts?Well?None of it, Holden said.Desperate psychotic people do desperate psychotic things when theyre exposed.I refuse to grant them immunity from exposure out of fear of their reaction.When you do, the desperate psychos wind up in charge.She laughed.It was a surprisingly warm sound.Anyone who understands whats going on is at least desperate and probably psychotic to boot.Dissociative at the least.Let me explain it this way, Avasarala said.You tell everyone, and yeah, youll get a reaction.And maybe, weeks, or months, or years from now, it will all get sorted out.But you tell the right people, and we can sort it out right now.Amos and Prax walked into the galley together.Amos had his big thermos in his hand and headed straight toward the coffeepot.Prax followed him and picked up a mug.Avasaralas eyes narrowed and she said, Maybe even save that little girl.Mei?Prax said immediately, putting the mug down and turning around.Oh, that was low, Holden thought.Even for a politician.Yes, Mei, Avasarala replied.Thats what this is about, right, Jim?Not some personal crusade, but trying to save a little girl from very bad people?Explain how  Holden started, but Avasarala kept talking right over the top of him.The UN isnt one person.It isnt even one corporation.Its a thousand little, petty factions fighting against each other.Their sides got the floor, but thats temporary.Thats always temporary.I know people who can move against Nguyen and his group.They can cut off his support, strip him of ships, even recall and court martial him given enough time.But they cant do any of that if were in a shooting war with Mars.And if you toss everything you know into the wind, Mars wont have time to wait and figure out the subtleties; theyll have no choice but to preemptively strike against Nguyens fleet, Io, whats left of Ganymede.Everything.Io?Prax said.But Mei   So you want me to give all the info to your little political cabal back on Earth, when the entire reason for this problem is that there are little political cabals back on Earth.Yes, Avasarala said.And Im the only hope shes got.You have to trust me.I dont.Not even a little bit.I think youre part of the problem.I think you see all of this as political maneuvering and power games.I think you want to win.So no, I dont trust you at all.Hey, uh, Cap?Amos said, slowly screwing the top onto his thermos.Aint you forgetting something?What, Amos?What am I forgetting?Dont we vote on shit like this now?Dont pout, Naomi said.She was stretched out on a crash couch next to the main operations panel on the ops deck.Holden was seated across the room from her at the comm panel.Hed just sent out Avasaralas data file to her two UN admirals.His fingers itched with the desire to dump it into a general broadcast.But theyd debated the issue for the crew, and shed won the vote.The whole voting thing had seemed like such a good idea when hed first brought it up.After losing his first vote, not so much.Theyd all be dead in two days, so at least it probably wouldnt happen again.If we get killed, and Avasaralas pet admirals dont actually do anything with the data we just sent, this was all for nothing.You think theyll bury it?Naomi said.I dont know, and thats the problem.I dont know what theyll do.We met this UN politician two days ago and shes already running the ship.So send it to someone else too, Naomi said.Someone who you can trust to keep it quiet, but can get the word out if the UN guys turn out to be working for the wrong team.Thats not a bad idea.Fred, maybe?No.Holden laughed.Fred would see it as political capital.Hed use it to bargain with.It needs to be someone that has nothing to gain or lose by using it.Ill have to think about it.Naomi got up, then came over to straddle his legs and sit on his lap facing him.And were all about to die.Thats not making any of this any easier.Not all of us.Naomi, gather the crew up, the marine and Avasarala too.The galley, I guess.I have some last business to announce.Ill meet you guys there in ten minutes.She kissed him lightly on the nose.Okay.Well be there.When she disappeared from sight down the crew ladder, Holden opened up the chief of the watchs locker.Inside were a set of very out of date codebooks, a manual of Martian naval law, and a sidearm and two magazines of ballistic gel rounds.He took out the gun, loaded it, and strapped the belt and holster around his waist.Next he went back to the comm station and put Avasaralas data package into a tightbeam transmission that would bounce from Ceres to Mars to Luna to Earth, using public routers all the way.It would be unlikely to send up any red flags.He hit the video record button and said, Hi, Mom.Take a look at this.Show it to the family.I have no idea how youll know when the right time to use it is, but when that time comes, do with it whatever seems best.I trust you guys, and I love you.Before he could say anything else or think better of the whole thing, he hit the transmit key and turned the panel off.He called up the ladder lift, because riding it would take longer than climbing the ladder and he needed time to think out exactly how to play the next ten minutes.When he reached the crew deck, he still didnt have it all figured out, but he squared his shoulders and walked into the galley anyway.Amos, Alex, and Naomi were sitting on one side of the table, facing him.Prax was in his usual perch on the counter.Bobbie and Avasarala sat sideways on the other side of the table so that they could see him.That put the marine less than two meters away, with nothing between her and him.Depending on how this went, that might be a problem.He dropped his hand to the butt of the gun at his hip to make sure everyone saw it, then said, We have about two days before elements of the UN Navy get close enough to overwhelm our defenses with a torpedo salvo and destroy this ship.Alex nodded, but no one spoke.But we have the Mao racing pinnace that brought Avasarala to us attached to the hull.It holds two.Were going to stick two people on it and get them away.Then were going to turn around and head straight for those UN ships to buy the pinnace time.Who knows, we may even take one with us.Get ourselves a few servants in the afterlife.Fucking A, Amos said.I can support that, Avasarala said.Whore the lucky bastards?And how do we stop the UN ships from just killing it after they kill this ship?Prax and Naomi, Holden said immediately, before anyone else could speak.Prax and Naomi go on the ship.Okay, Amos said, nodding.Why?Naomi and Avasarala said at the same moment.Prax because hes the face of this whole thing.Hes the guy who figured it all out.And because when someone finally rescues his little girl, itd be nice if her daddy was there, Holden said.Then, tapping the butt of the gun with his fingers: And Naomi because I fucking said so.Questions?Nope, Alex said.Works for me.Holden was watching the marine closely.If someone tried to take the gun from him, it would be her.And she worked for Avasarala.If the old lady decided she wanted to be on the Razorback when it left, the marine would be the one who tried to make that happen.But to his surprise, she didnt move except to raise her hand.Sergeant?Holden said.Two of those six Martian ships that are tailing the UN boys are new Raptor class fast cruisers.They can probably catch the Razorback if they really want to.Would they?Holden asked.It was my impression that they were there to keep an eye on the UN ships and nothing else.Well, probably not, but She drifted off mid sentence with a distant look in her eyes.So thats the plan, Holden said.Prax, Naomi, get whatever supplies you need packed up and get on the Razorback.Everyone else, Id appreciate it if you waited here while they did that.Hold on a minute  Naomi protested, her voice angry.Before Holden could respond, Bobbie spoke again.Hey, you know?I just had an idea.Forty Three: Bobbie  They were all missing something.It was like someone knocking at the back of her mind, demanding to be let in.Bobbie went over it in her head.Sure, that prick Nguyen showed every sign he was willing to kill the Rocinante, ranking UN politician on board or not.Avasarala had made a gamble that her presence would back the UN ships off.It seemed she was about to lose that bet.There were still six UN destroyers bearing down on them.But there were six more ships tailing them.Including, as shed just pointed out to Holden, two Raptor class fast attack cruisers.Top of the line Martian military hardware, and more than a match for any UN destroyer.Along with the two cruisers were four Martian destroyers.They might or might not be better than their UN counterparts, but with the two cruisers in their wing, they had a significant tonnage and firepower advantage.And they were following the UN ships to see that they werent about to do something to escalate the shooting war.Like killing the one UN politician who wasnt straining at the leash for a war with Mars.Hey, you know?Bobbie said before she realized she was going to say anything.I just had an idea  The galley fell silent.Bobbie had a sudden and uncomfortable memory of speaking up in the UN conference room and wrecking her military career in the process.Captain Holden, the cute one who was a little too full of himself, was staring at her, a not particularly flattering gape on his face.He looked like a very angry person whod lost his train of thought mid rant.And Avasarala was staring at her too.Though, having learned to read the old ladys expression better, she didnt see anger there.Just curiosity.Well, Bobbie said, clearing her throat.There are six Martian ships following those UN ships.And the Martian ships outclass them.Both navies are at high alert.No one moved or spoke.Avasaralas curiosity had turned to a frown.So, Bobbie continued, they might be willing to back us up.Avasaralas frown had only gotten deeper.Why, she said, would the Martians give a fuck about protecting me from being killed by my own damn Navy?Would it hurt to ask?No, Holden said.Im thinking no.Is everyone else here thinking it wouldnt hurt?Whod make the call?Avasarala asked.You?The traitor?The words were like a gut punch.But Bobbie realized what the old lady was doing.She was hitting Bobbie with the worst possible Martian response.Gauging her reaction to it.Yeah, Id open the door, Bobbie said.But youre the one that will have to convince them.Avasarala stared at her for one very long minute, then said, Okay.Repeat that, Rocinante, the Martian commander said.The connection was as clear as if they were standing in the room with the man.It wasnt the sound quality that was throwing him.Avasarala spoke slowly, enunciating carefully, all the same.This is Assistant Undersecretary Chrisjen Avasarala of the United Nations of Earth, Avasarala said again.I am about to be attacked by a rogue element of the UN Navy while on my way to a peacekeeping mission in the Jupiter system.Fucking save me!I will reward you by talking my government out of glassing your planet.Im going to have to send this up the chain, the commander said.They werent using a video link, but the grin was audible in his voice.Call whoever you need to call, Avasarala said.Just make a decision before these cunts start raining missiles down on me.All right?Ill do my best, maam.The skinny one her name was Naomi killed the connection and swiveled to look at Bobbie.Why would they help us, again?Mars doesnt want a war, Bobbie replied, hoping she wasnt talking completely out her ass.If they find out that the UNs voice of reason is on a ship thats about to be killed by rogue UN war hawks, it only makes sense for them to step in.Kind of sounds like youre talking out your ass there, Naomi said.Also, Avasarala said, I just gave them permission to shoot at the UN Navy without political repercussions.Even if they help, Holden said, theres no way they can completely stop the UN ships from taking some shots at us.Well need an engagement plan.We just got this damn thing put back together, Amos said.I still say we stick Prax and Naomi on the Razorback, Holden said.Im starting to think thats a bad idea, Avasarala said.She took a sip of coffee and grimaced.The old lady was definitely missing her five cups of tea a day.Explain, Holden said.Well, if the Martians decide theyre on our side, that changes the whole landscape for those UN ships.They cant beat all seven of us, if I understand the math right.Okay, Holden said.That makes it in their interest not to be called a rogue element in the history books.If Nguyens cabal fails, everyone on his team gets at minimum a court martial.The best way to make sure that doesnt happen is to make sure I dont survive this fight, no matter who wins.Which means theyll be shooting at the Roci, Naomi said.Not the pinnace.Of course not, Avasarala said with a laugh.Because of course Ill be on the pinnace.You think for a second theyll believe that youre desperately trying to protect an escape craft that Im not on?And I bet the Razorback doesnt have those PDCs you were talking about.Does it?To Bobbies surprise, Holden was nodding as Avasarala spoke.Shed sort of pegged him as a know it all who fell in love only with his own ideas.Yeah, Holden said.Youre absolutely right.Theyll fling everything theyve got at the Razorback as she tries to get away, and shell have no defense.Which means we all live or we all die, right here on this ship, Naomi said with a sigh.As usual.So, again, Holden said.We need an engagement plan.This is a pretty thin crew, Bobbie said now that the conversation had moved back to her area of expertise.Wheres everyone usually sit?Operations officer, Holden said, pointing at Naomi.She also does electronic warfare and countermeasures.And shes a savant, considering shed never worked it before we got this ship.Mechanic  Holden started, pointing at Amos.Grease monkey, Amos said, cutting him off.I do my best to keep the ship from falling apart when theres holes in it.I usually man the combat ops board, Holden said.Whos the gunner?Bobbie asked.Yo, said Alex, pointing at himself.You fly and do target acquisition?Bobbie said.Im impressed.Alexs already dark skin grew a shade darker.His aw shucks Mariner Valley drawl had started to go from annoying to charming.And the blush was sweet.Aw, no.The capn does acquisition from combat ops, generally.But I have to manage fire control.Well, there you go, Bobbie said, turning to Holden.Give me weps.No offense, Sergeant Holden said.Gunny, Bobbie replied.Gunny, Holden agreed with a nod.But are you qualified to operate fire control on a naval vessel?Bobbie decided not to be offended and grinned at him instead.I saw your armor and the weapons you were carrying in the airlock.You found a MAP in the cargo bay, right?Map?Avasarala asked.Mobile assault package.Marine assault gear.Not as good as my Force Recon armor, but full kit for half a dozen ground pounders.Yeah, Holden said.Thats where we got it.Thats because this is a multi role fast attack ship.Torpedo bomber is just one of them.Boarding party insertion is another.And gunnery sergeant is a rank with a very specific meaning.Yeah, Alex said.Equipment specialist.Im required to be proficient in all of the weapons systems my platoon or company might need to operate during a typical deployment.Including the weapons systems on an assault boat like this.I see  Holden started, but Bobbie cut him off with a nod.Im your gunner.Like most things in Bobbies life, the weapons officers chair had been made for someone smaller than her.The five point harness was digging into her hips and her shoulders.Even at its farthest setting, the fire control console was just a bit too close for her to comfortably rest her arms on the crash couch while using it.All of which would be a problem if they had to do any really high g maneuvering.Which, of course, they would once the fight started.She tucked her elbows in as close as she could to keep her arms from wrenching out of their sockets at high g, and fidgeted with the harness.It would have to be good enough.From his seat behind and above her, Alex said, Thisll be over quick one way or the other.You probably wont have time to get too uncomfortable.Thats reassuring.Over the 1MC Holden said, Were inside the maximum effective weapon range now.They could fire immediately or twenty hours from now.So stay belted in.Only leave your station in life threatening emergency and at my direct order.I hope everyone got their catheter on right.Mines too tight, Amos said.Alex spoke behind her, and it was echoed a split second later over the comm channel.Its a condom catheter, partner.It goes on the outside.Bobbie couldnt help laughing and held one hand up behind her until Alex slapped it.Holden said, We have greens across the board down here in ops.Everyone check in with go/no go status.All green at flight control, Alex said.Green at electronic warfare, Naomi said.Were go down here, Amos said.Weapons are green and hot, Bobbie said last.Even strapped into a chair two sizes too small for her, on a stolen Martian warship captained by one of the most wanted men in the inner planets, it felt really goddamned good to be there.Bobbie restrained a whoop of joy and instead pulled Holdens threat display up.Hed already marked the six pursuing UN destroyers.Bobbie tagged the lead ship and let the Rocinante try to come up with a target solution on it.The Roci calculated the odds of a hit at less than.1 percent.She jumped from target to target, getting a feel for the response times and controls.She tapped a button to pull up target info and looked over the UN destroyer specs.When reading ship specs bored her, she pulled out to the tactical view.One tiny green dot pursued by six slightly larger red dots, which were in turn pursued by six blue dots.That was wrong.The Earth ships should be blue, and the Martians red.She told the Roci to swap the color scheme.The Rocinante was oriented toward the pursuing ships.On the map, it looked like they were flying directly at each other.But in reality, the Rocinante was in the middle of a deceleration burn, slowing down to let the UN ships catch up faster.All thirteen of the ships in this particular engagement were hurtling sunward.The Roci was just doing it ass first.Bobbie glanced at the time and saw that her noodling with the controls had burned less than fifteen minutes.I hate waiting for a fight.You and me both, sister, Alex said.Got any games on this thing?Bobbie asked, tapping on her console.I spy with my little eye, Alex replied, something that begins with D.   Destroyer, Bobbie said.Six tubes, eight PDCs, and a keel mounted rapid fire rail gun.Good guess.Your turn.I fucking hate waiting for a fight.When the battle began, it began all at once.Bobbie had expected some early probing shots.A few torpedoes fired from extreme range, just to see if the crew of the Rocinante had full control of all the weapon systems and everything was in working order.Instead, the UN ships had closed the distance, the Roci slamming on the brakes to meet them.Bobbie watched the six UN ships creep closer and closer to the red line on her threat display.The red line that represented the point at which a full salvo from all six ships would overwhelm the Rocis point defense network.Meanwhile, the six Martian ships moved closer to the green line on her display that represented their optimal firing range to engage the UN ships.It was a big game of chicken, and everyone was waiting to see who would flinch first.Alex was juggling their deceleration thrust to try to make sure the Martians got in range before the Earthers did.When the shooting started, he would put the throttle down and try to move through the active combat zone as quickly as possible.It was why they were going to meet the UN ships in the first place.Running away would just have kept them in range a lot longer.Then one of the red dots a Martian fast attack cruiser crossed the green line, and alarms started going off all over the ship.Fast movers, Naomi said.The Martian cruiser has fired eight torpedoes!Bobbie could see them.Tiny yellow dots shifting to orange as they took off at high g.  The UN ships immediately responded.Half of them spun around to face the pursuing Martian ships and opened up with their rail guns and point defense cannons.The space on the tactical display between the two groups was suddenly filled with yellow orange dots.Incoming!Naomi yelled.Six torpedoes on a collision course!Half a second later, the torpedoes vector and speed information popped up on Bobbies PDC control display.Holden had been right.The skinny Belter was good at this.Her reaction times were astonishing.Bobbie flagged all six torpedoes for the PDCs, and the ship began to vibrate as they fired in a rapid staccato.Juice coming, Alex said, and Bobbie felt her couch prick her in half a dozen places.Cold pumped into her veins, quickly becoming white hot.She shook her head to clear the threatening tunnel vision while Alex said, Three two  He never said one.The Rocinante smashed into Bobbie from behind, crushing her into her crash couch.She remembered at the last second to keep her elbows lined up, and avoided having her arms broken as every part of her tried to fly backward at ten gravities.On her threat display, the initial wave of six torpedoes fired at them winked out one by one as the Roci tracked and shot them down.More torpedoes were in the air, but now the entire Martian wing had opened up on the Earthers, and the space around the ships had become a confusion of drive tails and detonations.Bobbie told the Roci to target anything on an approach vector and shoot at it with the point defenses, leaving it up to Martian engineering and the universes good graces.She switched one of the big displays to the forward cameras, turning it into a window on the battle.Ahead of her the sky was filled with bright white flashes of light and expanding clouds of gas as torpedoes detonated.The UN ships had decided that the Martians were the real threat, and all six of them had spun to face the enemy ships head on.Bobbie tapped a control to throw a threat overlay onto the video image, and suddenly the sky was full of impossibly fast blobs of light as the threat computer put a glowing outline on every torpedo and projectile.The Rocinante was coming up fast on the UN destroyers, and the thrust dropped to two g.  Here we go, Alex said.Bobbie pulled up the torpedo targeting system and targeted the drive cones of two of the ships.Two away, she said, releasing her first two fish into the water.Bright drive trails lit the sky as they streaked off.The ready to fire indicator went red as the ship reloaded the tubes.Bobbie was already selecting the drive cones of the next two UN ships.The instant the ready indicator went green, she fired them both.She targeted the last two destroyers, then checked on the progress of her first two torpedoes.They were both gone, shot down by the destroyers aft PDCs.A wave of fast moving blobs of light hurtled toward them, and Alex threw the ship sideways, dancing out of the line of fire.It wasnt enough.
