The closest marine took a half step forward, but that was all.My theory is, Amos said, that to avoid that whole problem, they just go ahead and cut off all those parts that might get caught up in your suit.And it has the added benefit of reducing your temptation to diddle each other during those long cold nights on the ship.The marine took another step, and Amos immediately took one of his own to close the distance.With his nose so close to the marines armored faceplate that his breath fogged the glass, Amos said, So be straight with me, Joe.The outside of those suits, thats anatomically correct, aint it?There was a long, tense silence that was finally broken when someone cleared his throat at the hatch, and the lieutenant came into the corridor.There a problem here?Amos smiled and stepped back.Nope.Just getting to know the fine men and women my tax dollars help pay for.Sergeant?the lieutenant said.The marine stepped back.No, sir.No problem.The lieutenant turned around and shook Naomis hand.Captain Estancia, it has been a pleasure.Our people will be radioing you with landing clearance shortly.Im sure the people of Ganymede will be grateful for the supplies youre bringing.Happy to help, Naomi said, and gave the young officer a brilliant smile.When the UN troops had cycled back through the airlock and flown away in their skiff, Naomi let out a long breath and began massaging her cheeks.If I had to smile one second longer, my face was going to crack apart.Holden grabbed Amos by the sleeve.What.The.Fuck, he said through gritted teeth, was that all about?What?Naomi said.Amos here did just about everything he could to piss the marines off while you were gone.Im surprised they didnt shoot him, and then me half a second later.Amos glanced down at Holdens hand, still gripping his arm, but made no move to pull free.Cap, youre a good guy, but youd be a shitty smuggler.What?Naomi said again.The captain here was so nervous even I started to think he was up to something.So I kept the marines attention until you got back, Amos said.Oh, and they cant shoot you unless you actually touch them or draw a weapon.You were a UN Navy boy.You should remember the rules.So Holden started.So, Amos interrupted.If the lieutenant asks them about us, theyll have a story to tell about the asshole engineer who got in their faces, and not the nervous guy with the patchy beard who kept trying to hide in the corner.Shit, Holden said.Youre a good captain, and you can have my back in a fight anytime.But youre a crap criminal.You just dont know how to act like anyone but yourself.Wanna be captain again?Naomi said.That job sucks.Ganymede tower, this is Somnambulist repeating our request for a pad assignment, Naomi said.Weve been cleared by the UN patrols, and youve had us holding in low orbit for three hours now.Naomi flicked off her mic and added, Asshole.The voice that replied was different from the one theyd been requesting landing clearance from for the last few hours.This one was older and less annoyed.Sorry, Somnambulist, well get you into the pattern as soon as possible.But weve had launches nonstop for the last ten hours, and we still have a dozen ships to get off of the ground before we start letting people land.Holden turned on his mic and said, We talking to the supervisor now?Yep.Senior supervisor Sam Snelling if youre making notes for a complaint.Thats Snelling with two Ls.No, no, Holden replied.Not a complaint.Weve been watching the outgoing ships flying by.Are these refugee ships?With the tonnage weve seen lifting off, it looks like half the moon is leaving.Nope.We do have a few charters and commercial liners taking people off, but most of the ships leaving right now are food freighters.Food freighters?We ship almost a hundred thousand kilos of food a day, and the fighting trapped a lot of those shipments on the surface.Now that the blockade is letting people through, theyre on their way out to make their deliveries.Wait, Holden said.Im waiting to land with relief food supplies for people starving on Ganymede, and youre launching a hundred thousand kilos of food off the moon?Closer to half a million, what with the backup, Sam said.But we dont own this food.Most of the food production on Ganymede is owned by corporations that arent headquartered here.Lot of money tied up in these shipments.Every day it sat on the ground here, people were losing a fortune.I Holden started, then after a pause said, Somnambulist out.Holden turned his chair around to face Naomi.Her expression was closed in a way that meant she was as angry as he was.Amos, lounging near the engineering console and eating an apple hed stolen from their relief supplies, said, This surprises you why, Captain?An hour later, they got permission to land.Seen from low orbit and their descent path, the surface of Ganymede didnt look much different than it ever had.Even at its best, the Jovian moon was a wasteland of gray silicate rock and slightly less gray water ice, the entire thing pocked with craters and flash frozen lakes.It had looked like a battlefield long before humanitys ancestors crawled up onto dry land for the first time.But humans, with their great creativity and industriousness in the domain of destruction, had found ways to make their mark.Holden spotted the almost skeletal remains of a destroyer stretched across the landscape at the end of a long black scar.The shock wave of its impact had flattened smaller domes as far as ten kilometers away.Tiny rescue ships flitted about its corpse, looking less for survivors than for bits of information or technology that had survived the crash and couldnt be allowed to fall into enemy hands.The worst damage visible was the complete loss of one of the enormous greenhouse domes.The agricultural domes were gigantic structures of steel and glass with hectares of carefully cultivated soil and meticulously bred and tended crops beneath them.To see one crushed beneath the twisted metal of what looked like a fallen mirror array was shocking and demoralizing.The domes fed the outer planets with their specially bred crops.The most advanced agricultural science in history happened inside them.And the orbiting mirrors were marvels of engineering that helped make it possible.Slamming one into the other, and leaving both lying in ruins, struck Holden as being as stupidly shortsighted as shitting in your water supply to deny your enemy a drink.By the time the Somnambulist had set her creaking bones to rest on their assigned landing pad, Holden had lost all patience with human stupidity.So, of course, it came out to meet him.The customs inspector was waiting for them when they stepped out of the airlock.He was a stick thin man with a handsome face and an egg shaped bald head.He was accompanied by two men in nondescript security guard uniforms with Tasers in holsters at their belts.Hello, my name is Mr.Vedas.I am the customs inspector for port eleven, pads A14 through A22.Your manifest, please.Naomi, once again playing captain, stepped forward and said, The manifest was transmitted to your office prior to landing.I ont   Holden saw that Vedas wasnt holding an official cargo inspection terminal, nor were the guards with him wearing Ganymede Port Authority uniforms.He got the tingling premonition of a bad con job about to be played out.He moved up and waved Naomi off.Captain, Ill take care of this.Customs inspector Vedas looked him up and down and said, And you are?You can call me Mr.Not putting up with your bullshit.Vedas scowled, and the two security guards shuffled closer.Holden smiled at them, then reached behind his back and under his coat and pulled out a large pistol.He held it at the side of his leg, pointed at the ground, but they stepped back anyway.Vedas blanched.I know this shakedown, Holden said.You ask to look at our manifest; then you tell us which items we have mistakenly included on it.And while we are retransmitting to your office with our newly amended manifest, you and your goons take the plum items and sell them on what Im guessing is a thriving black market for food and medicine.I am a legally vested administrator of Ganymede Station, Vedas squeaked.You think you can bully me with your gun?Ill have port security arrest you and impound your entire ship if you think   No, Im not going to bully you, Holden said.But I have had it right up to here with idiots profiting from misery, and Im going to make myself feel better by having my big friend Amos here beat you senseless for trying to steal food and medicine from refugees.Aint bullying so much as stress relief, Amos said amiably.Holden nodded at Amos.How angry does it make you that this guy wants to steal from refugees, Amos?Pretty fucking angry, Captain.Holden patted his pistol against his thigh.The gun is just to make sure port security there doesnt interfere until Amos has fully worked out his anger issues.Mr.Vedas, customs inspector for port eleven, pads A14 through A22, turned and ran as though his life depended on it, with his rent a cops in hot pursuit.You enjoyed that, Naomi said.Her expression was odd and evaluating, her voice in the no mans land between accusing and not.Holden holstered his gun.Lets go find out what the hell happened here.Seven: Prax  The security center was on the third layer down from the surface.The finished walls and independent power supply seemed like luxury items compared with the raw ice of other places on the station, but really they were important signals.The way some plants advertised their poisons by bright foliage, the security center advertised its impregnability.It wasnt enough that it was impossible to tunnel through the ice and sneak a friend or a lover out of the holding cells.Everyone had to know that it was impossible know just by looking or else someone would try it.In all his years on Ganymede, Prax had been there only once before, and then as a witness.As a man there to help the law, not to ask help from it.Hed been back twelve times in the last week, waiting in the long, desperate line, fidgeting and struggling with the almost overpowering sense that he needed to be somewhere else doing something, even if he didnt know what exactly it was.Im sorry, Dr.Meng, the woman at the public information counter said from behind her inch thick wire laced window.She looked tired.More than tired, more than exhausted even.Shell shocked.Dead.Nothing today either.Is there anyone I can talk to?There has to be a way to   Im sorry, she said, and her eyes looked past him to the next desperate, frightened, unbathed person that she wouldnt be able to help.Prax walked out, teeth grinding in impotent rage.The line was two hours long; men and women and children stood or leaned or sat.Some were weeping.A young woman with red rimmed eyes smoked a marijuana cigarette, the smell of burning leaves over the stink of close packed bodies, the smoke curling up past the NO SMOKING sign on the wall.No one protested.All of them had the haunted look of refugees, even the ones whod been born here.In the days since the official fighting had stopped, the Martian and Earth militaries had retreated back behind their lines.The breadbasket of the outer planets found itself reduced to a wasteland between them, and the collected intelligence of the station was bent to a single task: getting away.The ports had started out under lockdown by two military forces in conflict, but theyd soon left the surface for the safety of their ships, and the depth of panic and fear in the station could no longer be contained.The few passenger ships that were permitted out were packed with people trying to get anywhere else.The fares for passage were bankrupting people whod worked for years in some of the highest paying material science positions outside Earth.The poorer people were left sneaking out in freight drones or tiny yachts or even space suits strapped onto modified frames and fired off toward Europa in hopes of rescue.Panic drove them from risk to risk until they wound up somewhere else or in the grave.Near the security stations, near the ports, even near the abandoned military cordons set up by Mars and the UN, the corridors were thick with people scrambling for anything they could tell themselves was safety.Prax wished he was with them.Instead, his world had fallen into a kind of rhythm.He woke at his rooms, because he always went home at night so that he would be there if Mei came back.He ate whatever he could find.The last two days, there hadnt been anything left in his personal storage, but a few of the ornamental plants in the parkways were edible.He wasnt really hungry anyway.Then he checked the body drops.The hospital had maintained a scrolling video feed of the recovered dead to help in identification for the first week.Since then, hed had to go look at the actual bodies.He was looking for a child, so he didnt have to go through the vast majority of the dead, but the ones he did see haunted him.Twice hed found a corpse sufficiently mutilated that it might have been Mei, but the first had a stork bite birthmark at the back of her neck and the others toenails were the wrong shape.Those dead girls were someone elses tragedies.Once hed assured himself that Mei wasnt among the lists of the dead, he went hunting.The first night shed been gone, hed taken out his hand terminal and made a list.People to contact who had official power: security, her doctors, the warring armies.People to contact who might have information: the other parents at her school, the other parents in his medical support group, her mother.Favorite places to check: her best friends home, the common space parks she liked best, the sweet shop with the lime sherbet she always asked for.Places someone might go to buy a stolen child for sex: a list of bars and brothels off a cached copy of the station directory.The updated directory would be on the system, but it was still locked down.Every day, he crossed as many off the list as he could, and when they were all gone, he started over.From a list, theyd become a schedule.Security every other day, alternating with whoever would talk to him from the Martian forces or the UN on the other days.The parks in the morning after the body checks.Meis best friend and her family had made it out, so there was nothing to check there.The sweet shop had been burned out in a riot.Finding her doctors was the hardest.Dr.Astrigan, her pediatrician, had made all the right concerned noises and promised him that she would call him if she heard anything and then, when he checked again three days later, didnt remember having spoken to him.The surgeon whod helped drain the abscesses along her spine when shed first been diagnosed hadnt seen her.Dr.Strickland from the support and maintenance group was missing.Nurse Abuakar was dead.The other families from the group had their own tragedies to work through.Mei wasnt the only child missing.Katoa Merton.Gabby Solyuz.Sandro Ventisiete.Hed seen the fear and desperation that shrieked in the back of his head mirrored in the faces of the other parents.It made those visits harder than looking at bodies.It made the fear hard to forget.He did it anyway.Basia Merton KatoaDaddy, Mei called him was a thick necked man who always smelled of peppermint.His wife was pencil thin with a nervous twitch of a smile.Their home was six chambers near the water management complex five levels down from the surface, decorated in spun silk and bamboo.When Basia opened the door, he didnt smile or say hello; he only turned and walked in, leaving the way open.Prax followed him.At the table, Basia poured Prax a glass of miraculously unspoiled milk.It was the fifth time Prax had come since Mei had gone missing.No sign, then?Basia said.It wasnt really a question.No news, Prax said.So theres that, at least.From the back of the house, a young girls voice rose in outrage, matched by a younger boys.Basia didnt even turn to look.Nothing here either.Im sorry.The milk tasted wonderful, smooth and rich and soft.Prax could almost feel the calories and nutrients being sucked in through the membranes in his mouth.It occurred to him that he might technically be starving.Theres still hope, Prax said.Basia blew out his breath like the words had been a punch in the gut.His lips were pressed thin and he was staring at the table.The shouting voices in the back resolved into a low boyish wail.Were leaving, Basia said.My cousin works on Luna for Magellan Biotech.Theyre sending relief ships, and when they put off the medical supplies, theres going to be room for us.Its all arranged.Prax put down the glass of milk.The chambers around them seemed to go quiet, but he knew that was an illusion.A strange pressure bloomed in his throat, down into his chest.His face felt waxy.He had the sudden physical memory of his wife announcing that shed filed for divorce.Betrayed.He felt betrayed.after that, another few days, Basia was saying.Hed been talking, but Prax hadnt heard him.But what about Katoa?Prax managed to say around the thickness in his throat.Hes here somewhere.Basias gaze flickered up and then away, fast as a birds wing.Hes not.Hes gone, brother.Boy had a swamp where his immune system shouldve been.You know that.Without his medicine, he used to start feeling really sick in three, maybe four days.I have to take care of the two kids I still got.Prax nodded, his body responding without him.He felt like a flywheel had come loose somewhere in the back of his head.The grain of the bamboo table seemed unnaturally sharp.The smell of ice melt.The taste of milk going sour on his tongue.You cant know that, he said, trying to keep his voice soft.He didnt do a great job.I pretty much can.Whoever whoever took Mei and Katoa, they arent useful to them dead.They knew.They had to know that theyd need medicine.And so it only makes sense that theyd take them somewhere they could get it.No one took them, brother.They got lost.Something happened.Meis teacher said   Meis teacher was scared crazy.Her whole world was making sure toddlers dont spit in each others mouths too much, and theres a shooting war outside her room.Who the hell knows what she saw?She said Meis mother and a doctor.She said a doctor   And come on, man.Not useful if theyre dead?This station is ass deep in dead people, and I dont see anyone getting useful.Its a war.Fuckers started a war.There were tears in his wide, dark eyes now, and sorrow in his voice.But there was no fight.People die in a war.Kids die.You gotta ah shit.You got to keep moving.You dont know, Prax said.You dont know that theyre dead, and until you know, youre abandoning them.Basia looked down at the floor.There was a flush rising under the mans skin.He shook his head, the corners of his mouth twitching down.You cant go, Prax said.You have to stay and look for him.Dont, Basia said.And I mean do not shout at me in my own home.These are our kids, and you dont get to walk away from them!What kind of father are you?I mean, Jesus   Basia was leaning forward now, hunched over the table.Behind him, a girl on the edge of womanhood looked in from the hallway, her eyes wide.Prax felt a deep certainty rising in him.Youre going to stay, he said.The silence lasted three heartbeats.Four.Five.Its arranged, Basia said.Prax hit him.He didnt plan it, didnt intend it.His arm rolled through the shoulder, balled fist shooting out of its own accord.His knuckles sank into the flesh of Basias cheek, snapping his head to the side and rocking him back.The big man boiled across the room at him.The first blow hit just below Praxs collarbone, pushing him back, the next one was to his ribs, and the one after that.Prax felt his chair slide out from under him, and he was falling slowly in the low g but unable to get his feet beneath him.Prax swung wild, kicked out.He felt his foot connect with something, but he couldnt tell if it was the table or Basia.He hit the floor, and Basias foot came down on his solar plexus.The world went bright, shimmering, and painful.Somewhere a long way away, a woman was shouting.He couldnt make out the words.And then, slowly, he could.Hes not right.He lost a baby too.Hes not right.Prax rolled over, forced himself up to his knees.There was blood on his chin he was pretty sure came from him.No one else there was bleeding.Basia stood by the table, hands in fists, nostrils flared, breath fast.The daughter stood in front of him, interposed between her enraged father and Prax.All he could really see of her was her ass and her ponytail and her hands, flat out at her father in the universal gesture for stop.She was saving his life.Youd be better off gone, brother, Basia said.Okay, Prax said.He got to his feet slowly and stumbled to the door, still not quite breathing right.He let himself out.The secret of closed system botanical collapse was this: Its not the thing that breaks you need to watch out for.Its the cascade.The first time hed lost a whole crop of G.  kenon, it had been from a fungus that didnt hurt soybeans at all.The spores had probably come in with a shipment of ladybugs.The fungus took hold in the hydroponic system, merrily taking up nutrients that werent meant for it and altering the pH.That weakened the bacteria Prax had been using to fix nitrogen to the point that they were vulnerable to a phage that wouldnt have been able to take them out otherwise.The nitrogen balance of the system got out of whack.By the time the bacteria recovered to their initial population, the soybeans were yellow, limp, and past repair.That was the metaphor he used when he thought about Mei and her immune system.The problem was tiny, really.A mutant allele produced a protein that folded left instead of right.A few base pairs difference.But that protein catalyzed a critical step in signal transduction to the T cells.She could have all the parts of an immune system standing ready to fight off a pathogen, but without twice daily doses of an artificial catalyzing agent, the alarm would never sound.Myers Skelton Premature Immunosenescence they called it, and the preliminary studies still hadnt even been able to tell if it was more common outside the well of Earth because of an unknown low g effect or just the high radiation levels increasing mutations rates generally.It didnt matter.However shed gotten there, Mei had developed a massive spinal infection when she was four months old.If theyd been anywhere else in the outer planets, shed have died of it.But everyone came to Ganymede to gestate, so the child health research all happened there.When Dr.Strickland saw her, he knew what he was looking at, and he held back the cascade.Prax walked down the corridors toward home.His jaw was swelling.He didnt remember being hit in the jaw, but it was swelling, and it hurt.His ribs had a sharp pain on the left that hurt if he breathed in too deep, so he kept his breath shallow.He stopped at one of the parks, scrounging a few leaves for dinner.He paused at a large stand of Epipremnum aureum.The wide spade shaped leaves looked wrong.They were still green, but thicker, and with a golden undertone.Someone had put distilled water in the hydroponic supply instead of the mineral rich solution long stability hydroponics needed.They could get away with it for another week.Maybe two.Then the air recycling plants would start to die, and by the time that happened, the cascade would be too far gone to stop.And if they couldnt get the right water to the plants, he couldnt imagine theyd be able to set all the mechanical air recyclers going.Someone was going to have to do something about that.Someone else.In his rooms, his one small G.  kenon held its fronds up to the light.Without any particular conscious thought, he put his finger in the soil, testing it.The rich scent of well balanced soil was like incense.It was doing pretty well, all things considered.He glanced at the time stamp on his hand terminal.Three hours had passed since hed come home.His jaw had gone past aching into a kind of constantly rediscovered pain.Without her medicine, the normal flora of her digestive system would start overgrowing.The bacteria that normally lived benignly in her mouth and throat would rise against her.After two weeks, maybe she wouldnt be dead.But even in the best case, shed be so sick that bringing her back would be problematic.It was a war.Kids died in wars.It was a cascade.He coughed, and the pain was immense and it was still better than thinking.He needed to go.To get out.Ganymede was dying around him.He wasnt going to do Mei any good.She was gone.His baby girl was gone.Crying hurt worse than coughing.He didnt sleep so much as lose consciousness.When he woke, his jaw was swollen badly enough that it clicked when he opened his mouth too wide.His ribs felt a degree better.He sat on the edge of his bed, head in his hands.Hed go to the port.Hed go to Basia and apologize and ask to go along.Get out of the Jovian system entirely.Go someplace and start over without his past.Without his failed marriage and shattered work.Without Mei.He switched to a slightly less dirty shirt.Swabbed his armpits with a damp cloth.Combed his hair back.Hed failed.It was pointless.He had to come to terms with the loss and move on.And maybe someday he would.He checked his hand terminal.That day was checking the Martian body drop, walking the parks, checking with Dr.Astrigan, and then a list of five brothels he hadnt been to, where he could ask after the illicit pleasures of pedophilia, hopefully without being gutted by some right thinking, civic minded thug.Thugs had children too.Some probably loved them.With a sigh, he keyed in a new entry: MINERALIZE PARK WATER.Hed need to find someone with physical plant access codes.Maybe security could help with that at least.And maybe, somewhere along the way, hed find Mei.There was still hope.Eight: Bobbie  The Harman Dae Jung was a Donnager class dreadnought, half a kilometer in length, and a quarter million tons dry weight.Her interior docking bay was large enough to hold four frigate class escort ships and a variety of lighter shuttles and repair craft.Currently, it held only two ships: the large and almost opulent shuttle that had ferried the Martian ambassadors and state officials up for the flight to Earth, and the smaller and more functional Navy shuttle Bobbie had ridden up from Ganymede.Bobbie was using the empty space to jog.The Dae Jungs captain was being pressured by the diplomats to get them to Earth as quickly as possible, so the ship was running at a near constant one g acceleration.While this made most of the Martian civilians uncomfortable, it suited Bobbie just fine.The corps trained at high g all the time and did lengthy endurance drills at one g at least once a month.No one ever said it was to prepare for the possibility of having to fight a ground war on Earth.No one had to.Her recent tour on Ganymede hadnt allowed her to get in any high g exercise, and the long trip to Earth seemed like an excellent opportunity to get back into shape.The last thing she wanted was to appear weak to the natives.Anything you can do I can do better, she sang to herself in a breathless falsetto as she ran.I can do anything better than you.She gave her wristwatch a quick glance.Two hours.At her current leisurely pace, that meant twelve miles.Push for twenty?How many people on Earth regularly ran for twenty miles?Martian propaganda would have her believe that half of the people on Earth didnt even have jobs.They just lived off the government dole and spent their meager allowances on drugs and stim parlors.But probably some of them could run for twenty miles.Shed bet Snoopy and his gang of Earther marines could have run twenty miles, the way they were running from   Anything you can do I can do better, she sang, then concentrated on nothing but the sound of her shoes slapping on the metal deck.She didnt see the yeoman enter the docking bay, so when he called out to her, she twisted in surprise and tripped over her own feet, catching herself with her left hand just before she would have dashed her brains out on the deck.She felt something pop in her wrist, and her right knee bounced painfully off the floor as she rolled to absorb the impact.She lay on her back for a few moments, moving her wrist and knee to see if there was any serious damage.Both hurt, but neither had any grating sensation in it.Nothing broken, then.Barely out of the hospital and already looking for ways to bang herself up again.The yeoman ran up to her and dropped into a crouch at her side.Jesus, Gunny, you took a hell of a spill!the Navy boy said.A hell of a spill!He touched her right knee where the bruise was already starting to darken the bare skin below her jogging shorts, then seemed to realize what he was doing and yanked his hand back.Sergeant Draper, your presence is requested at a meeting in conference room G at fourteen fifty hours, he said, squeaking a little as he rattled off his message.How come you dont carry your terminal with you?Theyve had trouble tracking you down.Bobbie pushed herself back up to her feet, gingerly testing her knee to see if it would hold her weight.You just answered your own question, kid.Bobbie arrived at the conference room five minutes early, her red and khaki service uniform sharply pressed and marred only by the white wrist brace the company medic had given her for what turned out to be a minor sprain.A marine in full battle dress and armed with an assault rifle opened the door for her and gave her a smile as she went by.It was a nice smile, full of even white teeth, below almond shaped eyes so dark they were almost black.Bobbie smiled back and glanced at the name on his suit.Corporal Matsuke.Never knew who youd run into in the galley or the weight room.It didnt hurt to make a friend or two.She was pulled the rest of the way into the room by someone calling her name.Sergeant Draper, Captain Thorsson repeated, gesturing impatiently toward a chair at the long conference table.Sir, Bobbie said, and snapped off a salute before taking the seat.She was surprised by how few people were in the room.Just Thorsson from the intelligence corps and two civilians she hadnt met.Gunny, were going over some of the details in your report; wed appreciate your input.Bobbie waited a moment to be introduced to the two civilians in the room, but when it became clear Thorsson wasnt going to do it, she just said, Yes, sir.Whatever I can do to help.The first civilian, a severe looking redheaded woman in a very expensive suit, said, Were trying to create a better timeline of the events leading up to the attack.Can you show us on this map where you and your fire team were when you received the radio message to return to the outpost?Bobbie showed them, then went step by step through the events of that day.Looking at the map theyd brought, she saw for the first time how far shed been flung across the ice by the impact of the orbital mirror.It looked like it had been a matter of centimeters between that and being smashed into dust like the rest of her platoon    Sergeant, Thorsson said, his tone of voice letting her know hed said it a couple of times before.Sir, sorry, looking at these photos sent me woolgathering.It wont happen again.Thorsson nodded, but with a strange expression Bobbie couldnt read.What were trying to pinpoint is precisely where the Anomaly was inserted prior to the attack, the other civilian, a chubby man with thinning brown hair, said.The Anomaly they called it now.You could hear them capitalize the word when they said it.Anomaly, like something that just happens.A strange random event.It was because everyone was still afraid to call it what it really was.The Weapon.So, the chubby guy said, based on how long you had radio contact, and information regarding loss of radio signal from other installations around that area, we are able to pinpoint the source of the jamming signal as the Anomaly itself.Wait, Bobbie said, shaking her head.What?The monster cant have jammed our radios.It had no tech.It wasnt even wearing a damned space suit to breathe!How could it be carrying jamming equipment?Thorsson patted her hand paternally, a move that irritated Bobbie more than it calmed her.The data doesnt lie, Sergeant.The zone of radio blackout moved.And always at its center was the thing.The Anomaly, Thorsson said, then turned away from her to speak to the chubby guy and the redhead.Bobbie sat back, feeling the energy move away from her in the room, like she was the one person at the dance without a date.But since Thorsson hadnt dismissed her, she couldnt just leave.Redhead said, Based on our radio loss data, that puts insertion here she pointed at something on the map and the path to the UN outpost is along this ridge.Whats in that location?Thorsson said with a frown.Chubby pulled up a different map and pored over it for a few seconds.Looks like some old service tunnels for the domes hydro plant.This says they havent been used in decades.So, Thorsson said.The kind of tunnels one might use to transport something dangerous that needs to be kept secret.Yes, Redhead said, maybe they were delivering it to that Marine outpost and it got loose.The marines cut and ran when they saw it was out of control.Bobbie gave a dismissive laugh before she could stop herself.You have something to add, Sergeant Draper?Thorsson said.Thorsson was looking at her with his enigmatic smile, but Bobbie had worked with him long enough now to know that what he hated most was bullshit.If you spoke up, he wanted to make sure you actually had something useful to say.The two civilians were looking at her with surprise, as though she were a cockroach that had suddenly stood up on two legs and started speaking.She shook her head.When I was a boot, you know what my drill sergeant said was the second most dangerous thing in the solar system, after a Martian Marine?The civvies continued to stare at her, but Thorsson nodded and mouthed the words along with her as she next spoke.A UN Marine.Chubby and Redhead shared a look and Redhead rolled her eyes for him.But Thorsson said, So you dont think the UN soldiers were running from something that got out of their control.Not a fucking chance, sir.Then give us your take on it.That UN outpost was staffed by a full platoon of Marines.Same strength as our outpost.When they finally started running, there were six left.Six.They fought almost to the last man.When they ran to us, they werent trying to disengage.They were coming so we could help them continue the fight.Chubby picked a leather satchel up off the floor and started rummaging in it.Redhead watched, as though what he was doing was far more interesting than anything Bobbie had to say.If this were some secret UN thing that those Marines were tasked to deliver or protect, they wouldnt have come.Theyd have died doing it rather than abandon their mission.Thats what we would have done.Thank you, Thorsson said.I mean, it wasnt even our fight, and we fought to the last marine to stop that thing.You think the UN Marines would do less?Thank you, Sergeant, Thorsson said again, louder.I tend to agree, but we have to explore all possibilities.Your comments are noted.Chubby finally found what he was looking for.A small plastic box of mints.He took one out, then held the box out to Redhead to take one.The sickly sweet smell of spearmint filled the air.Around a mouthful of mint, Chubby said, Yes, thank you, Sergeant.I think we can proceed here without taking up more of your time.Bobbie stood up, snapped another salute at Thorsson, and left the room.Her heart was going fast.Her jaw ached where she was grinding her teeth.Civvies didnt get it.No one did.When Captain Martens came into the cargo bay, Bobbie had just finished disassembling the gun housing on her combat suits right arm.She removed the three barrel Gatling gun from its mount and placed it on the floor next to the two dozen other parts shed already stripped off.Next to them sat a can of gun cleaner and a bottle of lubricant, along with the various rods and brushes shed use to clean the parts.Martens waited until she had the gun on the cleaning mat, then sat down on the floor next to her.She attached a wire brush to the end of one of the cleaning rods, dipped it in the cleaner, and began running the brush through the gun, one barrel at a time.Martens watched.After a few minutes, she replaced the brush with a small cloth and swabbed the remaining cleanser out of the barrels.Then a fresh cloth soaked in gun lubricant to oil them.When she was applying lube to the complex mesh of gears that composed the Gatling mechanism and ammo feed system, Martens finally spoke.You know, he said, Thorsson is naval intelligence right from the start.Straight into officer training, top of his class at the academy, and first posting at fleet command.Hes never done anything but be an intelligence wonk.The last time he fired a gun was his six weeks as a boot, twenty years ago.Hes never led a fire team.Or served in a combat platoon.That, Bobbie said, putting down her lubricant then standing up to put the gun back together, is a fascinating story.I really appreciate you sharing it.So, Martens continued, not missing a beat.How fucked up do you have to be before Thorsson starts asking me if maybe you arent a little shell shocked?Bobbie dropped the wrench she was holding, but caught it with her other hand before it could hit the deck.Is this an official visit?Because if not, you can f   Me now?Im not a wonk, Martens said.Im a marine.Ten years as an enlisted man before I was offered OCS.Got dual degrees in psychology and theology.The end of Bobbies nose itched, and she scratched it without thinking.The sudden smell of gun oil let her know that shed just rubbed lubricant all over her face.Martens glanced at it but didnt stop talking.She tried to drown him out by putting the gun together as noisily as possible.Ive done combat drills, CQB training, war games, he said, speaking a little louder.Did you know I was a boot at the same camp where your father was first sergeant?Sergeant Major Draper is a great man.He was like a god to us boots.Bobbies head snapped up and her eyes narrowed.Something about this headshrinker acting like he knew her father felt dirty.Its true.And if he were here right now, hed be telling you to listen to me.Fuck you, Bobbie said.She imagined her father wincing at the use of obscenity to hide her fear.You dont know shit.I know that when a gunnery sergeant with your level of training and combat readiness almost gets taken out by a yeoman still at the tail end of puberty, something is goddamned wrong.Bobbie threw the wrench at the ground, knocking over the gun oil, which began to spread across her mat like a bloodstain.I fucking fell down!We were at a full g, and I just I fell down.And in the meeting today?Yelling at two civilian intelligence analysts about how Marines would rather die than fail?I didnt yell, Bobbie said, not sure if that was the truth.Her memories of the meeting had become confused once she was out of the room.How many times have you fired that gun since you cleaned it yesterday?What?Bobbie said, feeling nauseated and not sure why.For that matter, how many times had you fired it since you cleaned it the day before that?Or the one before that?Stop it, Bobbie said, waving one hand limply at Martens and looking for a place to sit back down.Have you fired that gun even once since youve come on board the Dae Jung?Because I can tell you that youve cleaned it every single day youve been on board, and several times youve cleaned it twice in one day.No, I  Bobbie said, finally sitting down with a thump on an ammo canister.She had no memory of having cleaned the gun before that day.I didnt know that.This is post traumatic stress disorder, Bobbie.Its not a weakness or some kind of moral failure.Its what happens when you live through something terrible.Right now youre not able to process what happened to you and your men on Ganymede, and youre acting irrationally because of it, Martens said, then moved over to crouch in front of her.She was afraid for a moment that hed try to take her hand, because if he did, shed hit him.He didnt.Youre ashamed, he said, but theres nothing to be ashamed of.Youre trained to be tough, competent, ready for anything.They taught you that if you just do your job and remember your training, you can deal with any threat.Most of all, they taught you that the most important people in the world are the ones standing next to you on the firing line.Something twitched in her cheek just under her eye, and Bobbie rubbed at the spot hard enough to make stars explode in her vision.Then you ran into something that your training couldnt prepare you for, and against which you had no defense.And you lost your teammates and friends.Bobbie started to reply and realized shed been holding her breath, so instead of speaking, she exhaled explosively.Martens didnt stop talking.We need you, Roberta.We need you back.I havent been where you are, but I know a lot of people who have, and I know how to help you.If you let me.If you talk to me.I cant take it away.I cant cure you.But I can make it better.Dont call me Roberta, Bobbie said so quietly that she could barely hear herself.She took a few short breaths, trying to clear her head, trying not to hyperventilate.The scents of the cargo bay washed over her.The smell of rubber and metal from her suit.The acrid, competing scents of gun oil and hydraulic fluid, old and aged right into the metal no matter how many times the Navy boys swabbed the decks.The thought of thousands of sailors and marines passing through this same space, working on their equipment and cleaning these same bulkheads, brought her back to herself.She moved over to her reassembled gun and picked it up off the mat before the spreading pool of gun oil could touch it.No, Captain, talking to you is not whats going to get me better.Then what, Sergeant?That thing that killed my friends, and started this war?Somebody put that thing on Ganymede, she said, and seated the gun in its housing with a sharp metallic click.She gave the triple barrels a spin with her hand, and they turned with the fast oily hiss of high quality bearings.Im going to find out who.And Im going to kill them.Nine: Avasarala  The report was more than three pages long, but Soren had managed to find someone with the balls to admit it when he didnt know everything.Strange things were happening on Venus, stranger than Avasarala had known or guessed.A network of filaments had nearly encased the planet in a pattern of fifty kilometer wide hexagons, and apart from the fact that they seemed to carry superheated water and electrical currents, no one knew what they were.The gravity of the planet had increased by 3 percent.Paired whirlwinds of benzene and complex hydrocarbons were sweeping the impact craters like synchronized swimmers where the remains of Eros Station had smashed into the planetary surface.The best scientific minds of the system were staring at the data with their jaws slack, and the reason no one was panicking yet was that no one could agree on what they should panic about.On one hand, the Venusian metamorphosis was the most powerful scientific tool ever.Whatever happened did so in plain sight of everyone.There were no nondisclosure agreements or anti competition treaties to be concerned with.Anyone with a scanner sensitive enough could look down through the clouds of sulfuric acid and see what was going on today.Analyses were confidential, follow up studies were proprietary, but the raw data was orbiting the sun for anyone to see.Only, so far, it was like a bunch of lizards watching the World Cup.Politely put, they werent sure what they were looking at.But the data was clear.The attack on Ganymede and the spike in the energy expended on Venus had come at exactly the same time.And no one knew why.Well, thats worth shit, she said.Avasarala closed down her hand terminal and looked out the window.Around them the commissary murmured softly, like the best kind of restaurant, only without the ugly necessity of paying for anything.The tables were real wood and arranged carefully so that everyone had a view and no one could be overheard unless they wanted to be.It was raining that day.Even if the raindrops hadnt been pelting the windows, blurring city and sky, shed have known by the smell.Her lunch cold sag aloo and something that was supposed to be tandoori chicken sat on the table, untouched.Soren was still sitting across from her, his expression polite and alert as a Labrador retrievers.Theres no data showing a launch, Soren said.Whatevers on Venus would have to have gotten out to Ganymede, and theres no sign of that at all.Whatevers on Venus thinks inertias optional and gravity isnt a constant.We dont know what a launch would look like.As far as we know, they could walk to Jupiter.The boys nod conceded the point.Where do we stand on Mars?Theyve agreed to meet here.Theyve got ships on the way with the diplomatic delegation, including their witness.The marine?Draper?Yes, maam.Admiral Nguyen is in charge of the escort.Hes playing nice?So far.All right, where do we go from here?Avasarala asked.Jules Pierre Maos waiting in your office, maam.Run him down for me.Anything you thinks important.Soren blinked.Lightning lit the clouds from within.I sent the briefing  She felt a stab of annoyance that was half embarrassment.Shed forgotten that the background on the man was in her queue.There were thirty other documents there too, and shed slept poorly the night before, troubled by dreams in which Arjun had died unexpectedly.Shed had widowhood nightmares since her son had died in a skiing accident, her mind conflating the only two men shed ever loved.Shed meant to review the information before breakfast.Shed forgotten.But she wasnt going to admit it to some European brat just because he was smart, competent, and did everything she said.I know whats in the briefing.I know everything, she said, standing up.This is a fucking test.Im asking what you think is important about him.She walked away, moving toward the carved oak doors with a deliberate speed that made Soren scramble a little to keep up.Hes the corporate controlling interest of Mao Kwikowski Mercantile, Soren said, his voice low enough to carry to her and then die.Before the incident, they were one of Protogens major suppliers.The medical equipment, the radiation rooms, the surveillance and encryption infrastructure.Almost everything Protogen put on Eros or used to construct their shadow station came from a Mao Kwik warehouse and on a Mao Kwik freighter.And hes still breathing free air because?she said, pushing through the doors and into the hallway beyond.No evidence that Mao Kwik knew what the equipment was for, Soren said.After Protogen was exposed, Mao Kwik was one of the first to turn over information to the investigation committee.If they and by they, I mean he hadnt turned over a terabyte of confidential correspondence, Gutmansdottir and Kolp might never have been implicated.A silver haired man with a broad Andean nose walking the other way in the hall looked up from his hand terminal and nodded to her as they drew near.Victor, she said.Im sorry about Annette.The doctors say shell be fine, the Andean said.Ill tell her you asked.Tell her I said to get the hell out of bed before her husband starts getting dirty ideas, she said, and the Andean laughed as they passed.Then, to Soren: Was he cutting a deal?Cooperation for clemency?That was one interpretation, but most people assumed it was personal vengeance for what happened to his daughter.She was on Eros, Avasarala said.She was Eros, Soren said as they stepped into the elevator.She was the initial infection.The scientists think the protomolecule was building itself using her brain and body as a template.The elevator doors closed, the car already aware of who she was and where she was going.It dropped smoothly as her eyebrows rose.So when they started negotiating with that thing   They were talking to what was left of Jules Pierre Maos daughter, Soren said.I mean, they think they were.Avasarala whistled low.Did I pass the test, maam?Soren asked, keeping his face empty and impassive except for a small twinkle in the corners of his eyes that said he knew shed been bullshitting him.Despite herself, she grinned.No one likes a smart ass, she said.The elevator stopped; the doors slid open.Jules Pierre Mao sat at her desk, radiating a sense of calm with the faintest hint of amusement.Avasaralas eyes flickered over him, taking in the details: well tailored silk suit that straddled the line between beige and gray, receding hairline unmodified by medical therapies, startling blue eyes that he had probably been born with.He wore his age like a statement that fighting the ravages of time and mortality was beneath his notice.Twenty years earlier, hed just have been devastatingly handsome.Now he was that and dignified too, and her first, animal impulse was that she wanted to like him.Mr.Mao, she said, nodding to him.Sorry to make you wait.Ive worked with government before, he said.He had a European accent that would have melted butter.I understand the constraints.What can I do for you, Assistant Undersecretary?Avasarala lowered herself into her chair.The Buddha smiled beatifically from his place by the wall.The rain sheeted down the window, shadows giving the near subliminal impression that Mao was weeping.She steepled her fingers.You want some tea?No, thank you, Mao said.Soren!Go get me some tea.Yes, maam, the boy said.Soren.Maam?Dont hurry.Of course not, maam.The door closed behind him.Maos smile looked weary.Should I have brought my attorneys?Those rat fuckers?No, she said, the trials are all done with.Im not here to reopen any of the legal wrangling.Ive got real work to do.I can respect that, Mao said.I have a problem, Avasarala said.And I dont know what it is.And you think I do?Its possible.Ive been through a lot of hearings about one damn thing and another.Most of the time theyre exercises in ass covering.If the unvarnished truth ever came out at one, it would be because someone screwed up.The bright blue eyes narrowed.The smile grew less warm.You think my executives and I were less than forthcoming?I put powerful men in prison for you, Assistant Undersecretary.I burned bridges.Distant thunder mumbled and complained.The rain redoubled its angry tapping at the pane.Avasarala crossed her arms.You did.But that doesnt make you an idiot.There are still things you say under oath and things you dance around.This room isnt monitored.This is off the record.I need to know anything you can tell me about the protomolecule that didnt come out in the hearings.The silence between them stretched.She watched his face, his body, looking for signs, but the man was unreadable.Hed been doing this too long, and he was too good at it.A professional.Things get lost, Avasarala said.There was one time during the finance crisis that we found a whole auditing division that no one remembered.Because thats how you do it.You take part of a problem and you put it somewhere, get some people working on it, and then you get another part of the problem and get other people working on that.And pretty soon you have seven, eight, a hundred different little boxes with work going on, and no one talking to anyone because it would break security protocol.And you think?We killed Protogen, and you helped.Im asking whether you know of any little boxes lying around somewhere.And Im very much hoping you say yes.Is this from the secretary general or Errinwright?No.Just me.Ive already said everything I know, he said.I dont believe that.The mask of his persona slipped.It lasted less than a second, nothing more than a shift in the angle of his spine and a hardness in his jaw, here and gone again.It was anger.That was interesting.They killed my daughter, he said softly.Even if Id had something to hide, I wouldnt have.How did it come to be your girl?Avasarala asked.Did they target her?Was somebody using her against you?It was bad luck.She was out in the deep orbits, trying to prove something.She was young and rebellious and stupid.We were trying to get her to come home but she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.Something tickled at the back of Avasaralas mind.A hunch.An impulse.She went with it.Have you heard from her since it happened?I dont understand.Since Eros Station crashed into Venus, have you heard from her?It was interesting watching him pretend to be angry now.It was almost like the real thing.She couldnt have said what about it was inauthentic.The intelligence in his eyes, maybe.The sense that he was more present than he had been before.Real rage swept people away.This was rage as a gambit.My Julie is dead, he said, his voice shaking theatrically.She died when that bastard alien thing went down to Venus.She died saving the Earth.Avasarala countered soft.She lowered her voice, let her face take on a concerned, grandmotherly expression.If he was going to play the injured man, she could play the mother.Something lived, she said.Something survived that impact, and everybody knows that it did.I have reason to think that it didnt stay there.If some part of your daughter made it through that change, she might have reached out to you.Tried to contact you.Or her mother.There is nothing I want more than to have my little girl back, Mao said.But shes gone.Avasarala nodded.All right, she said.Is there anything else?Again, the false anger.She ran her tongue against the back of her teeth, thinking.There was something here, something beneath the surface.She didnt know what she was looking at with Mao.You know about Ganymede?she said.Fighting broke out, he said.Maybe more than that, she said.The thing that killed your daughter is still out there.It was on Ganymede.Im going to find out how and why.He rocked back.Was the shock real?Ill help if I can, he said, his voice small.Start with this.Is there anything you didnt say during the hearings?A business partner you chose not to mention.A backup program or auxiliary staff you outfitted.If it wasnt legal, I dont care.I can get you amnesty for just about anything, but I need to hear it now.Right now.Amnesty?he said as if shed been joking.If you tell me now, yes.If I had it, I would give it to you, he said.Ive said everything I know.All right, then.Im sorry to have taken your time.And Im sorry to open old wounds.I lost a son.Charanpal was fifteen.Skiing accident.Im sorry, Mao said.If you find out something more, bring it to me, she said.I will, he said, rising from his seat.She let him get almost to the doorway before she spoke again.Jules?Turning to glance over his shoulder, he looked like a still frame from a film.If I find out that you knew something and you didnt tell me, I wont take it well, she said.Im not someone you want to fuck with.If I didnt know that when I came in, I do now, Mao said.It was as good a parting line as any.The door closed behind him.Avasarala sighed, leaning back in her chair.She shifted to look at the Buddha.Fat lot of help you were, you smug bastard, she said.The statue, being only a statue, didnt reply.She thumbed down the lights and let the gray of the storm fill the room.Something about Mao didnt sit well with her.It might only have been the practiced control of a high level corporate negotiator, but she had the sense of being cut out of the loop.Excluded.That was interesting too.She wondered if he would try to counter her, maybe go over her head.It would be worth telling Errinwright to expect an angry call.She wondered.It was a stretch to believe there was anything human down on Venus.The protomolecule, as well as anyone understood it, had been designed to hijack primitive life and remake it into something else.But if If the complexity of a human mind had been too much for it to totally control, and the girl had in some sense survived the descent, if shed reached out to her daddy  Avasarala reached for her hand terminal and opened a connection to Soren.Maam?When I said dont hurry, I didnt mean you should take the whole fucking day off.My tea?Coming, maam.I got sidetracked.I have a report for you that might be interesting.Less interesting if the teas cold, she said, and dropped the channel.Putting any kind of real surveillance on Mao would probably be impossible.Mao Kwikowski Mercantile would have its own communications arrays, its own encryption schemes, and several rival companies at least as well funded as the United Nations already bent on ferreting out corporate secrets.But there might be other ways to track communications coming off Venus and going to Mao Kwik installations.Or messages going down that well.Soren came in carrying a tray with a cast iron teapot and an earthenware cup with no handle.He didnt comment on the darkness, but walked carefully to her desk, set down the tray, poured out a smoky, dark cupful of still steaming tea, and put his hand terminal on the desk beside it.You could just send me a fucking copy, Avasarala said.More dramatic this way, maam, Soren said.Presentation is everything.She snorted and pointedly picked up the cup, blowing across the dark surface before she looked at the terminal.The date stamp at the lower right showed it as coming from outside Ganymede seven hours earlier and the identification code of the associated report.The man in the picture had the stocky bones of an Earther, unkempt dark hair, and a peculiar brand of boyish good looks.Avasarala frowned at the image as she sipped her tea.What happened to his face?she asked.The reporting officer suggested the beard was intended as a disguise.She snorted.Well, thank God he didnt put on a pair of glasses, we might never have figured it out.What the fuck is James Holden doing on Ganymede?Its a relief ship.Not the Rocinante.We have confirmation on that?You know those OPA bastards can fake registration codes.The reporting officer did a visual inspection of the interior layout and checked the record when he got back.Also, the crew didnt include Holdens usual pilot, so we assume theyve got it parked and dark somewhere in tightbeam range, Soren said.He paused.There is a standing detain on sight for Holden.Avasarala turned the lights back on.The windows became dark mirrors again; the storm was pressed back outside.Tell me we didnt enforce it, Avasarala said.We didnt enforce it, Soren said.We have a surveillance detail on him and his team, but the situation on the station isnt conducive to a close watch.Plus which, it doesnt look like Mars knows hes there yet, so were trying to keep that to ourselves.Good that someone out there knows how to run an intelligence operation.Any idea what hes doing?So far, it looks a lot like a relief effort, Soren said with a shrug.We havent seen him meeting with anybody of special interest.Hes asking questions.Almost got into a fight with some opportunists whove been shaking down relief ships, but the other guys backed down.Its early, though.Avasarala took another sip of tea.She had to give it to the boy; he could brew a fine pot of tea.Or he knew someone who could, which was just as good.If Holden was there, that meant the OPA was interested in the situation on Ganymede.And that they didnt have someone already on the ground to report to them.Wanting the intelligence didnt in itself mean much.Even if it had been just a bunch of idiot ground pounders getting trigger happy, Ganymede was a critical station for the Jovian system and the Belt.The OPA would want their own eyes on the scene.But to send Holden, the only survivor of Eros Station, seemed more than coincidental.They dont know what it is, she said aloud.Maam?They smuggled in someone with experience in the protomolecule for a reason.Theyre trying to figure out what the hells going on.Which means they dont know.Which means She sighed.Which means it wasnt them.Which is a fucking pity, since theyve got the only live sample we know about.What would you like the surveillance team to do?Surveillance, she snapped.Watch him, see who he talks to and what he does.Daily reports back if its boring, real time updates if it runs hot.Yes, maam.Do you want him brought in?Pull him and his people in when they try to leave Ganymede.Otherwise stay out of their way and try not to get noticed.Holdens an idiot, but hes not stupid.If he realizes hes being watched, hell start broadcasting pictures of all our Ganymede sources or something.Do not underestimate his capacity to fuck things up.Anything else?Another flash of lightning.Another roll of thunder.Another storm among trillions of storms that had assaulted the Earth since back in the beginning, when something had first tried to end all life on the planet.Something that was on Venus right now.And spreading.Find a way for me to get a message to Fred Johnson without Nguyen or the Martians finding out, she said.We may need to do some back channel negotiation.Ten: Prax  Pas kirrup es Im to this, the boy sitting on the cot said.Pinche salad, sa sa?Ten thousand, once was.He couldnt have been more than twenty.Young enough, technically, to be his son, just as Mei could have been the boys daughter.Colt thin from adolescent growth and a life in low g, his thinness was improbable to begin with.And hed been starving besides.I can write you a promissory note if you want, Prax said.The boy grinned and made a rude gesture.From his professional work, Prax knew that the inner planets thought of Belter slang as a statement about location.He knew from living as a food botanist on Ganymede that it was also about class.He had grown up with tutors in accent free Chinese and English.Hed spoken with men and women from everywhere in the system.From the way someone said allopolyploidy, he could tell if they came from the universities around Beijing or Brazil, if theyd grown up in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains or Olympus Mons or in the corridors of Ceres.Hed grown up in microgravity himself, but Belt patois was as foreign to him as to anyone fresh up the well.If the boy had wanted to speak past him, it would have been effortless.But Prax was a paying customer, and he knew the boy was making an effort to dial it back.The programming keyboard was twice as large as a standard hand terminal, the plastic worn by use and time.A progress bar was slowly filling along the side, notations in simplified Chinese cycling with each movement.The hole was a cheap one near the surface of the moon.No more than ten feet wide, four rough rooms inched into the ice from a public corridor hardly wider or better lit.The old plastic walls glittered and wept with condensation.They were in the room farthest from the corridor, the boy on his cot and Prax standing hunched in the doorway.No promise for the full record, the boy said.What is, is, sabe?Anything you can get would be great.The boy nodded once.Prax didnt know his name.It wasnt the sort of thing to ask.The days it had taken to track down someone willing to break through the security system had been a long dance between his own ignorance of Ganymede Stations gray economy and the increasing desperation and hunger in even the most corrupt quarters.A month before, the boy might have been skimming commercial data to resell or hold hostage for easily laundered private credit.Today he was looking for Mei in exchange for enough leafy greens to make a small meal.Agricultural barter, the oldest economy in humanitys record, had come to Ganymede.Authcopys gone, the boy said.Sucked into servers, buried ass deep.So if you cant break the security servers    Dont have to.Camera got memory, memory got cache.Since the lockdown, its just filling and filling.No one watching.Youre kidding, Prax said.The two biggest armies in the system are staring each other down, and theyre not watching the security cameras?Watching each other.No one half humps for us.The progress bar filled completely and chimed.The boy pulled open a list of identifying codes and started paging through them, muttering to himself.From the front room, a baby complained weakly.It sounded hungry.Of course it did.Your kid?The boy shook his head.Collateral, he said, and tapped twice on a code.A new window opened.A wide hall.A door half melted and forced open.Scorch marks on the walls and, worse, a puddle of water.There shouldnt be free water.The environmental controls were getting further and further away from their safe levels.The boy looked up at Prax.Cest la?Yes, Prax said.Thats it.The boy nodded and hunched back over his console.I need it before the attack.Before the mirror came down, Prax said.Hokay, boss.Waybacking.Tod a frames con null delta.Only see when something happens, que si?Fine.Thats fine.Prax moved forward, leaning to look over the boys shoulder.The image jittered without anything on the screen changing except the puddle, slowly getting smaller.They were going backward through time, through the days and weeks.Toward the moment when it had all fallen apart.Medics appeared in the screen, appearing to walk backward in the inverted world as they brought a dead body to lay beside the door.Then another draped over it.The two corpses lay motionless; then one moved, pawing gently at the wall, then more strongly until, in an eyeblink, he staggered to his feet and was gone.There should be a girl.Im looking for who brought out a four year old girl.Sa day care, no?Should be a thousand of them.I only care about the one.The second corpse sat up and then stood, clutching her belly.A man stepped into the frame, a gun in his hand, healing her by sucking the bullet from her guts.They argued, grew calm, parted peaceably.Prax knew he was seeing it all in reverse, but his sleep and calorie starved brain kept trying to make the images into a narrative.A group of soldiers crawled backward out of the ruined door, like a breech birth, then huddled, backed away in a rush.A flash of light, and the door had made itself whole, thermite charges clinging to it like fruit until a soldier in a Martian uniform rushed forward to collect them safely.Their technological harvest complete, the soldiers all backed rapidly away, leaving a scooter behind them, leaning against the wall.And then the door slid open, and Prax saw himself back out.He looked younger.He beat on the door, hands popping off the surface in staccato bursts, then leapt awkwardly onto the scooter and vanished backward.The door went quiet.Motionless.He held his breath.Walking backward, a woman carrying a five year old boy on her hip went to the door, vanished within, and then reappeared.Prax had to remind himself that the woman hadnt been dropping her son off, but retrieving him.Two figures backed down the corridor.No.Three.Stop.Thats it, Prax said, his heart banging against his ribs.Thats her.The boy waited until all three figures were caught in the cameras eye, stepping out into the corridor.Meis face was petulant; even in the low resolution of the security camera, he knew the expression.And the man holding her  Relief warred with outrage in his chest, and relief won.It was Dr.Strickland.Shed gone with Dr.Strickland, who knew about her condition, about the medicine, about all the things that needed to be done to keep Mei alive.He sank to his knees, his eyes closed and weeping.If hed taken her, she wasnt dead.His daughter wasnt dead.Unless, a thin demonic thought whispered in his brain, Strickland was too.The woman was a stranger.Dark haired with features that reminded Prax of the Russian botanists hed worked with.She was holding a roll of paper in her hand.Her smile might have been one of amusement or impatience.He didnt know.Can you follow them?he asked.See where they went?The boy looked at him, lips curled.For salad?No.Box of chicken and atche sauce.I dont have any chicken.Then you got what you got, the boy said with a shrug.His eyes had gone dead as marbles.Prax wanted to hit him, wanted to choke him until he dug the images out of the dying computers.But it was a fair bet the boy had a gun or something worse, and unlike Prax, he likely knew how to use it.Please, Prax said.Got your favor, you.No epressa me, si?Humiliation rose in the back of his throat, and he swallowed it down.Chicken, he said.Si.Prax opened his satchel and put a double handful of leaves, orange peppers, and snow onions on the cot.The boy snatched up a half of it and stuffed it into his mouth, eyes narrowing in animal pleasure.Ill do what I can, Prax said.He couldnt do anything.The only edible protein still on the station was either coming in a slow trickle from the relief supplies or walking around on two feet.People had started trying Praxs strategy, grazing off the plants in the parks and hydroponics.They hadnt bothered with the homework, though.Inedibles were eaten all the same, degrading the air scrubbing functions and throwing the balance of the stations ecosystem further off.One thing was leading to another, and chicken couldnt be had, or anything that might substitute for it.And even if there was, he didnt have time to solve that problem.In his own home, the lights were dim and wouldnt go bright.The soybean plant had stopped growing but didnt fade, which was an interesting datapoint, or would have been.Sometime during the day, an automated system had clicked into a conservation routine, limiting energy use.In the big picture, it might be a good sign.Or it might be the fever break just before the catastrophe.It didnt change what he had to do.As a boy, hed entered the schools young, shipping up with his family to the sunless reaches of space, chasing a dream of work and prosperity.He hadnt taken the change well.Headaches and anxiety attacks and constant, bone deep fatigue had haunted those first years when he needed to impress his tutors, be tracked as bright and promising.His father hadnt let him rest.The window is open until the window is closed, hed say, and then push Prax to do a little more, to find a way to think when he was too tired or sick or in pain to think.Hed learned to make lists, notes, outlines.By capturing his fleeting thoughts, he could drag himself to clarity like a mountain climber inching toward a summit.Now, in the artificial twilight, he made lists.The names of all the children he could remember from Meis therapy group.He knew there were twenty, but he could only remember sixteen.His mind wandered.He put the image of Strickland and the mystery woman on his hand terminal, staring at it.The confusion of hope and anger swirled in him until it faded.He felt like he was falling asleep, but his pulse was racing.He tried to remember if tachycardia was a symptom of starvation.For a moment, he came to himself, clear and lucid in a way he only then realized he hadnt been in days.He was starting to crash.His own personal cascade was getting ahead of him, and he wouldnt be able to keep up his investigation much longer without rest.Without protein.He was already half zombie.He had to get help.His gaze drifted to the list of childrens names.He had to get help, but first hed check, just check.Hed go to go to  He closed his eyes, frowned.He knew the answer.He knew that he knew.The security station.Hed go there and ask about each of them.He opened his eyes, writing security station down under the list, capturing the thought.Then UN outreach station.Mars outreach.All the places hed been before, day after day, only now with new questions.It would be easy.And then, when he knew, there was something else he was supposed to do.It took a minute to figure out what it was, and then he wrote it at the bottom of the page.Get help.Theyre all gone, Prax said, his breath ghosting white in the cold.Theyre all his patients, and theyre all gone.Sixteen out of sixteen.Do you know the probability of that?Its not random.The security man hadnt shaved in days.A long, angry ice burn reddened his cheek and neck, the wound fresh and untreated.His face must have touched an uninsulated piece of Ganymede.He was lucky to still have skin.He wore a thick coat and gloves.There was frost on the desk.I appreciate the information, sir, and Ill see it gets out to the relief stations    No, you dont understand, he took them.Theyre sick, and he took them.Maybe he was trying to keep them safe, the security man said.His voice was a gray rag, limp and weary.There was a problem with that.Prax knew there was a problem with that, but he couldnt remember what it was.The security man reached out, gently moving him aside, and nodded to the woman behind him.Prax found himself staring at her like he was drunk.I want to report a murder, she said, her voice shaking.The security man nodded, neither surprise nor disbelief in his eyes.Prax remembered.He took them first, he said.He took them before the attack happened.Three men broke into my apartment, the woman said.They My brother was with me and he tried to stop them.When did this happen, maam?Before the attack, Prax said.A couple hours ago, the woman said.Fourth level.Blue sector.Apartment 1453.Okay, maam.Im going to take you over to a desk here.I need you to fill out a report.My brothers dead.They shot him.And Im very sorry about that, maam.I need you to fill out a report so we can catch the men who did this.Prax watched them walk away.He turned back to the line of the traumatized and desperate waiting their turns to beg for help, for justice, for law.A flash of anger lit him, then flickered.He needed help, but there wasnt any to be had here.He and Mei were a pebble in space.They didnt signify.The security man was back, talking to a tall pretty woman about something horrible.Prax hadnt noticed the man returning, hadnt heard the beginning of the womans tale.He was starting to lose time.That wasnt good.The small sane part of his brain whispered that if he died, no one would look for Mei.Shed be lost.It whispered that he needed food, that hed needed it for days.That he didnt have very much time left.I have to go to the relief center, he said aloud.The woman and the security man didnt seem to hear.Thanks anyway.Now that he had started to notice his own condition, Prax was astonished and alarmed.His gait was a shuffle; his arms were weak and ached badly, though he couldnt remember having done anything to earn the pain.He hadnt lifted anything heavy or gone climbing.He hadnt done his daily exercise routine any time that he could remember.He didnt remember the last time hed eaten.He remembered the shudder of the falling mirror, the death of his dome, like it was something that had happened in a previous lifetime.No wonder he was falling apart.The corridors by the relief center were packed like a slaughterhouse.Men and women, many of them who looked stronger and healthier than he was, pushed against each other, making even the widest spaces feel narrow.The closer he got to the port, the more light headed he felt.The air was almost warm here, the barn hot of bodies.It stank of keytone acrid breath.Saints breath, his mother called it.The smell of protein breakdown, of bodies eating their own muscles to survive.He wondered how many people in the crowd knew what that scent was.People were yelling.Shoving.The crowd around him surged back and forth the way he imagined waves might press against a beach.Then open the doors and let us look!a woman shouted, far ahead of him.Oh, Prax thought.This is a food riot.He pushed for the edges, trying to get out.Trying to get away.Ahead of him, people were shouting.Behind him, they pushed.Banks of LEDs in the ceiling glowed white and gold.The walls were industrial gray.He put a hand out.Hed gotten to a wall.Somewhere, the dam burst, and the crowd flowed suddenly forward, the collective movement threatening to pull him swirling away into the flow.He kept a hand on the wall.The crowd thinned, and Prax staggered forward.The loading bay doors stood open.Beside them Prax saw a familiar face but couldnt place it.Someone from the lab, maybe?The man was thick boned and muscular.An Earther.Maybe someone hed seen in his travels through the failing station.Had he seen the man grubbing for food?But no, he looked too well fed.There was no gauntness to his cheeks.He was like a friend and also a stranger.Someone Prax knew and also didnt.Like the secretary general or a famous actor.Prax knew he was staring, but he couldnt stop.He knew that face.He knew it.It had to do with the war.Prax had a sudden flashbulb memory.He was in his apartment, holding Mei in his arms, trying to calm her.She was barely a year old, not walking, the doctors still tinkering to find the right pharmaceutical cocktail to keep her alive.Over her colic wail, the news streams were a constant alarmed chatter.A mans face played over and over.My name is James Holden and my ship, the Canterbury, was just destroyed by a warship with stealth technology and what appear to be parts stamped with Martian Navy serial numbers.That was him.That was why he recognized the face and felt that hed never seen it before.Prax felt a tug from somewhere near the center of his chest and found himself stepping forward.He paused.Beyond the loading doors, someone whooped.Prax took out his hand terminal, looked at his list.Sixteen names, sixteen children gone.And at the bottom of the page, in simple block characters: Get help.Prax turned toward the man whod started wars and saved planets, suddenly shy and uncertain.Get help, he said, and walked forward.Eleven: Holden  Santichai and Melissa Supitayaporn were a pair of eighty year old earthborn missionaries from the Church of Humanity Ascendant, a religion that eschewed supernaturalism in all forms, and whose theology boiled down to Humans can be better than they are, so lets do that.They also ran the relief depot headquarters with the ruthless efficiency of natural born dictators.Minutes after arriving, Holden had been thoroughly dressed down by Santichai, a frail wisp of a man with thinning white hair, about his altercation with customs officials at the port.After several minutes of trying to explain himself, only to be shouted down by the tiny missionary, he finally just gave up and apologized.Dont make our situation here any more precarious, Santichai repeated, apparently mollified by the apology but needing to drive this point home.He shook a sticklike brown finger in Holdens face.Got it, Holden said, holding up his hands in surrender.The rest of his crew had vanished at Santichais first angry outburst, leaving Holden to deal with the man alone.He spotted Naomi across the large open warehouse space of the relief depot, talking calmly to Melissa, Santichais hopefully less volatile wife.Holden couldnt hear any shouting, though with the voices of several dozen people and the grinding gears and engine whine and reverse alerts of three lift trucks, Melissa could have been flinging grenades at Naomi and he probably wouldnt have heard it.Looking for an opportunity to escape, Holden pointed at Naomi across the room and said, Excuse me, I   Santichai cut him off with a curt wave of one hand that sent his loose orange robes swirling.Holden found himself unable to disobey the tiny man.This, Santichai said, pointing in the direction of the crates being brought in from the Somnambulist, is not enough.I   The OPA promised us twenty two thousand kilos of protein and supplements by last week.This is less than twelve thousand kilos, Santichai said, punctuating his statement with a sharp poke at Holdens bicep.Im not in charge of   Why would they promise us things they have no intention of delivering?Promise twelve thousand if that is what you have.Do not promise twenty two thousand and then deliver twelve, he said, accompanied by more poking.I agree, Holden said, backing out of poke range with his hands up.I totally agree.Ill call my contact on Tycho Station immediately to find out where the rest of the promised supplies are.Im sure theyre on the way.Santichai shrugged in another swirl of orange.See that you do, he said, then steamed off toward one of the lift trucks.You!You!Do you see the sign that says medicine?Why are you putting things that are not medicine in that place?Holden used this distraction to make good his escape, and jogged over to Naomi and Melissa.Naomi had a form open on her terminal and was completing some paperwork while Melissa watched.Holden glanced around the warehouse space while Naomi worked.The Somnambulist was just one of almost twenty relief ships that had landed in the last twenty four hours, and the massive room was quickly filling up with crates of supplies.The chill air smelled of dust and ozone and hot oil from the lift trucks, but under it there was a vaguely unpleasant smell of decay, like rotting vegetation.As he watched, Santichai darted across the warehouse floor, shouting instructions to a pair of workers carrying a heavy crate.Your husband is something else, maam, Holden said to Melissa.Melissa was both taller and heavier than her tiny husband, but she had the same shapeless cloud of thinning white hair he had.She also had bright blue eyes that nearly disappeared in her face when she smiled.As she was doing now.Ive never met anyone else in my life who cared more about other peoples welfare, and less about their feelings, she said.But at least hell make sure everyone is well fed before he tells them all the many things they did wrong.I think that does it, Naomi said, hitting the key to send the filled out form to Melissas terminal, a charmingly outdated model she pulled out of a pocket in her robe when it chimed receipt.Mrs.Supitayaporn, Holden said.Melissa.Melissa, how long have you and your husband been on Ganymede?Almost, she said, tapping her finger against her chin and staring off into the distance, ten years?Can it be that long?It must be, because Dru had just had her baby, and he   Im wondering because the one thing no one outside of Ganymede seems to know is how this Holden gestured around him all got started.The station?The crisis.Well, the UN and Martian soldiers started shooting at each other; then we started seeing system failures    Yes, Holden said, cutting in again.I understand that.But why?Not one shot during the entire year that Earth and Mars have jointly held this moon.We had a war before the whole Eros thing, and they didnt bring it here.Then all at once everyone everywhere is shooting?What kicked that off?Melissa looked puzzled, another expression that made her eyes almost disappear in a mass of wrinkles.I dont know, she said.Id assumed they were shooting each other everywhere in the system.We dont get much news right now.No, Holden said.Its just here, and it was just for a couple of days.And then it stopped, with no explanation.That is odd, Melissa said, but I dont know that it matters.Whatever happened, it doesnt change what we need to do now.I suppose not, Holden agreed.Melissa smiled, embraced him warmly, then went off to check someone elses paperwork.Naomi hooked her arm through Holdens, and they started toward the warehouse exit into the rest of the station, dodging crates of supplies and aid workers as they went.How can they have had a whole battle here, she said, and no one knows why?They know, Holden said.Someone knows.The station looked worse on the ground than from space.The vital, oxygen producing plants that lined the corridor walls were turning an unhealthy shade of yellow.Many corridors didnt have lights, and the automatic pressure doors had been hand cranked and then wedged open; if one area of the station suddenly lost pressure, many adjoining sections would as well.The few people they ran into either avoided their eyes or stared at them with open hostility.Holden found himself wishing he were wearing his gun openly, rather than in a concealed holster at the small of his back.Whos our contact?Naomi asked quietly.Hmmmm?I assume Fred has people here, she replied under her breath as she smiled and nodded at a passing group of men.All of them openly carried weapons, though most were of the stabbing and clubbing variety.They stared back at her with speculative looks on their faces.Holden moved his hand under his coat and toward his gun, but the men moved on, only giving them a few backward glances before they turned a corner and disappeared from view.He didnt arrange for us to meet someone?Naomi finished in a normal voice.He gave me some names.But communication with this moon has been so spotty he wasnt able to   Holden was cut off by a loud bang from another part of the port.The explosion was followed by a roar that gradually resolved into people shouting.The few people in the corridor with them began to run, some toward the noise, but most away from it.Should we Naomi said, looking at the people running toward the commotion.Were here to see whats going on, Holden replied.So lets go see.They quickly became lost in the twisting corridors of Ganymedes port, but it didnt matter as long as they kept moving toward the noise and along with the growing wave of people running in the same direction.A tall, stocky man with spiked red hair ran alongside them for a while.He was carrying a length of black metal pipe in each hand.He grinned at Naomi and tried to hand her one.She waved it off.Bout fookin time, he yelled in an accent Holden couldnt place.He held his extra club out to Holden when Naomi didnt take it.What is?Holden asked, taking the club.Fookin bastahds flingin the victuals up, and the prols jus gotta shove, wut?Well, fook that, ya mudder humpin spunk guzzlas!Spiky Redhead howled and waved his club in the air, then took off at a faster run and disappeared into the crowd.Naomi laughed and howled at his back as he ran.When Holden shot her a look, she just smiled and said, Its infectious.A final bend in the corridor brought them to another large warehouse space, looking almost identical to the one ruled over by the Supitayaporns, except that this room was filled with a mob of angry people pushing toward the loading dock.The doors to the dock were closed, and a small group of port security officers were trying to hold the mob back.When Holden arrived, the crowd was still cowed by the security officers Tasers and shock prods, but from the rising tension and anger in the air, he could tell that wouldnt last long.Just behind the front line of rent a cops, with their nonlethal deterrents, stood a small clump of men in dark suits and sensible shoes.They carried shotguns with the air of men who were just waiting for someone to give them permission.That would be the corporate security, then.Looking over the room, Holden felt the scene snap into place.Beyond that closed loading bay door was one of the few remaining corporate freighters loaded down with the last food being stripped from Ganymede.And this crowd was hungry.Holden remembered trying to escape a casino on Eros when it went into security lockdown.Remembered angry crowds facing down men with guns.Remembered the screams and the smells of blood and cordite.Before he knew hed made a decision, he found himself pushing his way to the front of the crowd.Naomi followed, murmuring apologies in his wake.She grabbed his arm and stopped him for a moment.Are you about to do something really stupid?she asked.Im about to keep these people from being shot for the crime of being hungry, he said, wincing at the self righteous tone even as he said it.Dont, Naomi said, letting him go, pull your gun on anyone.They have guns.Guns plural.You have gun singular, which is why you will keep yours in your holster, or youll do this by yourself.Thats the only way you ever do anything.By yourself.It was the kind of thing Detective Miller would have said.For him, it had been true.That was a strong enough argument against doing it that way.Okay.Holden nodded, then resumed pushing his way to the front.By the time he reached it, two people had become the focus of the conflict.A gray haired port security man wearing a white patch with the word supervisor printed on it and a tall, thin dark skinned woman who could pass for Naomis mother were yelling at each other while their respective groups looked on, shouting agreements and insults.Just open the damn door and let us look!yelled the woman in a tone that let Holden know this was something she was repeating again and again.You wont get anything by yelling at me, the gray haired supervisor yelled back.Beside him, his fellow security guards held their shock sticks in white knuckled grips and the corporate boys held their shotguns in a loose cradle that Holden found far more threatening.The woman stopped shouting when Holden pushed his way up to the supervisor, and stared at him instead.Who?she said.Holden climbed up onto the loading dock next to the supervisor.The other guards waved their shock prods around a little, but no one jabbed him.The corporate thugs just narrowed their eyes and shifted their stances a bit.Holden knew that their confusion about who he was would only last so long, and when they finally got past it, he was probably going to get uncomfortably intimate with one of those cattle prods, if not just blasted in the face with a shotgun.Before that could happen, he thrust his hand out to the supervisor and said in a loud voice that would carry to the crowd, Hi there, Im Walter Philips, an OPA rep out of Tycho Station, and here as personal representative of Colonel Frederick Johnson.The supervisor shook his hand like a man in a daze.The corporate gorillas shifted again and held their guns more firmly.Mr.Philips, the supervisor said.The OPA has no authority  Holden ignored him and turned to the woman hed been shouting at.Maam, whats all the fuss?That ship, she said, pointing at the door, has almost ten thousand kilos of beans and rice on it, enough to feed the whole station for a week!The crowd murmured agreement at her back and shuffled forward a step or two.Is that true?Holden asked the supervisor.As I said, the man replied, holding up his hands and making pushing motions at the crowd as though he could drive them back through sheer force of will, we are not allowed to discuss the cargo manifests of privately owned   Then open the doors and let us look!the woman shouted again.While she yelled and the crowd picked up her chant  let us look, let us look  Holden took the security supervisor by the elbow and pulled his head close.In about thirty seconds, that mob is going to tear you and your men to pieces trying to get into that ship, he said.I think you should let them have it before this turns violent.Violent!The man gave a humorless laugh.Its already violent.The only reason the ship isnt long gone is because one of them set off a bomb and blew up the docking clamp release mechanism.If they try to take the ship, well   They will not take the ship, said a gravelly voice, and a heavy hand came down on Holdens shoulder.When he turned around, one of the corporate goons was standing behind him.This ship is Mao Kwikowski Mercantile property.Holden pushed the mans hand off his shoulder.A dozen guys with Tasers and shotguns isnt going to stop them, he said, pointing out at the chanting mob.Mr.the goon looked him up and down once  Philips.I dont give a drippy shit what you or the OPA thinks about anything, and especially not my chances of doing my job.So why dont you fuck off before the shooting starts?Well, hed tried.Holden smiled at the man and began to reach for the holster at the small of his back.He wished that Amos were here, but he hadnt seen him since they had gotten off the ship.Before he reached the pistol, his hand was enveloped by long slender fingers and squeezed tightly.How about this, Naomi said, suddenly at Holdens side.How about we skip past the posturing and I just tell you how this is actually going to work?Both Holden and the goon turned to look at Naomi in surprise.She held up one finger in a wait a minute gesture and pulled out her hand terminal.She called someone and turned on the external speaker.Amos, she said, still holding her finger up.Yep, came the reply.A ship is trying to leave from port 11, pad B9.Its full of food we could really use here.If it makes it off the ground, do we have an OPA gunship close enough to intercept?There was a long pause; then, with a chuckle, Amos said, You know we do, boss.Whom I actually saying this to?Call that ship and have them disable the freighter.Then have an OPA team secure it, strip it of everything, and scuttle it.Amos just said, You got it.Naomi closed up the terminal and put it back into her pocket.Dont test us, boy, she said to the goon, a hint of steel in her voice.Not one word of that was empty threat.Either you give these people the cargo, or well take the whole damned ship.Your choice.The goon stared at her for a moment, then motioned to his team and walked away.Port security followed, and Holden and Naomi had to dodge out of the way of the crowd rushing up the dock and to the loading bay doors.When they were out of danger of being trampled, Holden said, That was pretty cool.Getting shot standing up for justice probably seemed very heroic to you, she said, the steel not quite gone from her voice.But I want to keep you around, so stop being an idiot.Smart play, threatening the ship, Holden said.You were acting like that asshole Detective Miller, so I just acted like you used to.What I said was the kind of thing you say when youre not in a hurry to wave your gun around.I wasnt acting like Miller, he said, the accusation stinging, because it was true.You werent acting like you.Holden shrugged, noticing only afterward that it was another imitation of Miller.Naomi looked down at the captains patches on the shoulder of her Somnambulist jumpsuit.Maybe I should keep these  A small, unkempt looking man with salt and pepper hair, Chinese features, and a weeks growth of beard walked up to them and nodded nervously.He was literally wringing his hands, a gesture Holden had been pretty sure only little old ladies in ancient cinema made.He gave them another small nod and said, You are James Holden?Captain James Holden?From the OPA?Holden and Naomi glanced at each other.Holden tugged at his patchy beard.Is this actually helping at all?Be honest.Captain Holden, my name is Prax, Praxidike Meng.Im a botanist.Holden shook the mans hand.Nice to meet you, Prax.Im afraid we have to   You have to help me, Prax said.Holden could see that the man had been through a rough couple of months.His clothes hung off him like a starving mans, and his face was covered with yellowing bruises from a fairly recent beating.Sure, if youll see the Supitayaporns at the aid station, tell them I said   No!Prax shouted.I dont need that.I need you to help me!Holden shot a glance at Naomi.She shrugged.Your call.Okay, Holden said.Whats the problem?Twelve: Avasarala  Asmall house is a deeper kind of luxury, her husband said.To live in a space entirely our own, to remember the simple pleasures of baking bread and washing our own dishes.This is what your friends in high places forget.It makes them less human.He was sitting at the kitchen table, leaning back in a chair of bamboo laminate that had been distressed until it looked like stained walnut.The scars from his cancer surgery were two pale lines in the darkness of his throat, barely visible under the powdering of white stubble.His forehead was broader than when shed married him, his hair thinner.The Sunday morning sun spilled across the table, glowing.Thats crap, she said.Just because you pretend to live like a dirt farmer doesnt make Errinwright or Lus or any of the others less human.Theres smaller houses than this with six families living in them, and the people in those are a hundred times closer to animals than anyone I work with.You really think that?Of course I do.Otherwise why would I go to work in the morning?If someone doesnt get those half feral bastards out of the slums, who are you university types going to teach?An excellent point, Arjun said.What makes them less human is they dont fucking meditate.A small house isnt a luxury, she said, then paused.A small house and a lot of money, maybe.Arjun grinned at her.He had always had the most beautiful smile.She found herself smiling back at him, even though part of her wanted to be cross.Outside, Kiki and Suri shrieked, their small half naked bodies bolting across the grass.Their nurse trotted along a half second behind them, her hand to her side like she was easing a stitch.A big yard is a luxury, Avasarala said.It is.
