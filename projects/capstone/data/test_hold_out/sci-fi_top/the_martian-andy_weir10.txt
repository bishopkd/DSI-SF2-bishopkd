All working within tolerance, Vogel said.I am now doing a diagnostic on the reactor.I am thinking that Johanssen is busy with the launching training.So perhaps I do this diagnostic for her.Good idea, Lewis said.And hows our course?All is well, Vogel said.No adjustments necessary.We are still on track to planned trajectory within four meters.Keep me posted if anything changes.Ja, Commander.Floating to the other side of the core, Lewis took the other ladder out, again gaining gravity as she went down.She made her way to the Airlock 2 ready room.Beck held a coil of metal wire in one hand and a pair of work gloves in the other.Heya, Commander.Whats up?Id like to know your plan for recovering Mark.Easy enough if the intercept is good, Beck said.I just finished attaching all the tethers we have into one long line.Its two hundred and fourteen meters long.Ill have the MMU pack on, so moving around will be easy.I can get going up to around ten meters per second safely.Any more, and I risk breaking the tether if I cant stop in time.Once you get to Mark, how fast a relative velocity can you handle?I can grab the MAV easily at five meters per second.Ten meters per second is kind of like jumping onto a moving train.Anything more than that and I might miss.So, including the MMU safe speed, we need to get the ship within twenty meters per second of his velocity.And the intercept has to be within two hundred and fourteen meters, Beck said.Pretty narrow margin of error.Weve got a lot of leeway, Lewis said.The launch will be fifty two minutes before the intercept, and it takes twelve minutes.As soon as Marks S2 engine cuts out, well know our intercept point and velocity.If we dont like it, well have forty minutes to correct.Our engines two millimeters per second may not seem like much, but in forty minutes it can move us up to 5.7 kilometers.Good, Beck said.And two hundred and fourteen meters isnt a hard limit, per se.Yes it is, Lewis said.Nah, Beck said.I know Im not supposed to go untethered, but without my leash I could get way out there  Not an option.Lewis said.But we could double or even triple our safe intercept range  Were done talking about this, Lewis said sharply.Aye, Commander.LOG ENTRY: SOL 526  There arent many people who can say theyve vandalized a three billion dollar spacecraft, but Im one of them.Ive been pulling critical hardware out of the MAV left and right.Its nice to know that my launch to orbit wont have any pesky backup systems weighing me down.First thing I did was remove the small stuff.Then came the things I could disassemble, like the crew seats, several of the backup systems, and the control panels.Im not improvising anything.Im following a script sent by NASA, which was set up to make things as easy as possible.Sometimes I miss the days when I made all the decisions myself.Then I shake it off and remember Im infinitely better off with a bunch of geniuses deciding what I do than I am making shit up as I go along.Periodically, I suit up, crawl into the airlock with as much junk as I can fit, and dump it outside.The area around the MAV looks like the set of Sanford and Son.I learned about Sanford and Son from Lewiss collection.Seriously, that woman needs to see someone about her seventies problem.LOG ENTRY: SOL 529  Im turning water into rocket fuel.Its easier than youd think.Separating hydrogen and oxygen only requires a couple of electrodes and some current.The problem is collecting the hydrogen.I dont have any equipment for pulling hydrogen out of the air.The atmospheric regulator doesnt even know how.The last time I had to get hydrogen out of the air (back when I turned the Hab into a bomb) I burned it to turn it into water.Obviously that would be counterproductive.But NASA thought everything through and gave me a process.First, I disconnected the rover and trailer from each other.Then, while wearing my EVA suit, I depressurized the trailer and back filled it with pure oxygen at one fourth of an atmosphere.Then I opened a plastic box full of water and put a couple of electrodes in.Thats why I needed the atmosphere.Without it, the water would just boil immediately and Id be hanging around in a steamy atmosphere.The electrolysis separated the hydrogen and oxygen from each other.Now the trailer was full of even more oxygen and also hydrogen.Pretty dangerous, actually.Then I fired up the atmospheric regulator.I know I just said it doesnt recognize hydrogen, but it does know how to yank oxygen out of the air.I broke all the safeties and set it to pull 100 percent of the oxygen out.After it was done, all that was left in the trailer was hydrogen.Thats why I started out with an atmosphere of pure oxygen, so the regulator could separate it later.Then I cycled the rovers airlock with the inner door open.The airlock thought it was evacuating itself, but it was actually evacuating the whole trailer.The air was stored in the airlocks holding tank.And there you have it, a tank of pure hydrogen.I carried the airlocks holding tank to the MAV and transferred the contents to the MAVs hydrogen tanks.Ive said this many times before, but: Hurray for standardized valve systems!Finally, I fired up the fuel plant, and it got to work making the additional fuel Id need.Ill need to go through this process several more times as the launch date approaches.Im even going to electrolyze my urine.Thatll make for a pleasant smell in the trailer.If I survive this, Ill tell people I was pissing rocket fuel.*  [19:22] JOHANSSEN: Hello, Mark.[19:23] MAV: Johanssen!?Holy crap!They finally letting you talk to me directly?[19:24] JOHANSSEN: Yes, NASA gave the OK for direct communication an hour ago.Were only 35 light seconds apart, so we can talk in near real time.I just set up the system and Im testing it out.[19:24] MAV: What took them so long to let us talk?[19:25] JOHANSSEN: The psych team was worried about personality conflicts.[19:25] MAV: What?Just cause you guys abandoned me on a godforsaken planet with no chance of survival?[19:26] JOHANSSEN: Funny.Dont make that kind of joke with Lewis.[19:27] MAV: Roger.So uh thanks for coming back to get me.[19:27] JOHANSSEN: Its the least we could do.How is the MAV retrofit going?[19:28] MAV: So far, so good.NASA put a lot of thought into the procedures.They work.Thats not to say theyre easy.I spent the last 3 days removing Hull Panel 19 and the front window.Even in Mars g theyre heavy motherfuckers.[19:29] JOHANSSEN: When we pick you up, I will make wild, passionate love to you.Prepare your body.[19:29] JOHANSSEN: I didnt type that!That was Martinez!I stepped away from the console for like 10 seconds![19:29] MAV: Ive really missed you guys.LOG ENTRY: SOL 543  Im done?I think Im done.I did everything on the list.The MAV is ready to fly.And in six sols, thats just what itll do.I hope.It might not launch at all.I did remove an engine, after all.I could have fucked up all sorts of things during that process.And theres no way to test the ascent stage.Once you light it, its lit.Everything else, however, will go through tests from now until launch.Some done by me, some done remotely by NASA.Theyre not telling me the failure odds, but Im guessing theyre the highest in history.Yuri Gagarin had a much more reliable and safe ship than I do.And Soviet ships were death traps.*  All right, Lewis said, tomorrows the big day.The crew floated in the Rec.They had halted the rotation of the ship in preparation for the upcoming operation.Im ready, Martinez said.Johanssen threw everything she could at me.I got all scenarios to orbit.Everything other than catastrophic failures, Johanssen corrected.Well yeah, Martinez said.Kind of pointless to simulate an ascent explosion.Nothing we can do.Vogel, Lewis said.Hows our course?It is perfect, Vogel said.We are within one meter of projected path and two centimeters per second of projected velocity.Good, she said.Beck, how about you?Everythings all set up, Commander, Beck said.The tethers are linked and spooled in Airlock 2.My suit and MMU are prepped and ready.Okay, the battle plan is pretty obvious, Lewis said.She grabbed a handhold on the wall to halt a slow drift she had acquired.Martinez will fly the MAV, Johanssen will sysop the ascent.Beck and Vogel, I want you in Airlock 2 with the outer door open before the MAV even launches.Youll have to wait fifty two minutes, but I dont want to risk any technical glitches with the airlock or your suits.Once we reach intercept, itll be Becks job to get Watney.He might be in bad shape when I get him, Beck said.The stripped down MAV will get up to twelve gs during the launch.He could be unconscious and may even have internal bleeding.Just as well youre our doctor, Lewis said.Vogel, if all goes according to plan, youre pulling Beck and Watney back aboard with the tether.If things go wrong, youre Becks backup.Ja, Vogel said.I wish there was more we could do right now, Lewis said.But all we have left is the wait.Your work schedules are cleared.All scientific experiments are suspended.Sleep if you can, run diagnostics on your equipment if you cant.Well get him, Commander, Martinez said as the others floated out.Twenty four hours from now, Mark Watney will be right here in this room.Lets hope so, Major, Lewis said.*  Final checks for this shift are complete, Mitch said into his headset.Timekeeper.Go, Flight, said the timekeeper.Time until MAV launch?Sixteen hours, nine minutes, forty seconds mark.Copy that.All stations: Flight director shift change.He took his headset off and rubbed his eyes.Brendan Hutch took the headset from him and put it on.All stations, Flight director is now Brendan Hutch.Call me if anything happens, Mitch said.If not, Ill see you tomorrow.Get some sleep, Boss, Brendan said.Venkat watched from the observation booth.Why ask the timekeeper?he mumbled.Its on the huge mission clock in the center screen.Hes nervous, Annie said.You dont often see it, but thats what Mitch Henderson looks like when hes nervous.He double  and triple checks everything.Fair enough, Venkat said.Theyre camping out on the lawn, by the way, Annie said.Reporters from all over the world.Our press rooms just dont have enough space.The media loves a drama.He sighed.Itll be over tomorrow, one way or another.Whats our role in all this?Annie said.If something goes wrong, what can Mission Control do?Nothing, Venkat said.Not a damned thing.Nothing?Its all happening twelve light minutes away.That means it takes twenty four minutes for them to get the answer to any question they ask.The whole launch is twelve minutes long.Theyre on their own.So were completely helpless?Yes, Venkat said.Sucks, doesnt it?LOG ENTRY: SOL 549  Id be lying if I said I wasnt shitting myself.In four hours, Im going to ride a giant explosion into orbit.This is something Ive done a few times before, but never with a jury rigged mess like this.Right now, Im sitting in the MAV.Im suited up because theres a big hole in the front of the ship where the window and part of the hull used to be.Im awaiting launch instructions.Really, Im just awaiting launch.I dont have any part in this.Im just going to sit in the acceleration couch and hope for the best.Last night, I ate my final meal pack.Its the first good meal Ive had in weeks.Im leaving forty one potatoes behind.Thats how close I came to starvation.I carefully collected samples during my journey.But I cant bring any of them with me.So I put them in a container a few hundred meters from here.Maybe someday theyll send a probe to collect them.May as well make them easy to pick up.This is it.Theres nothing after this.There isnt even an abort procedure.Why make one?We cant delay the launch.Hermes cant stop and wait.No matter what, were launching on schedule.I face the very real possibility that Ill die today.Cant say I like it.It wouldnt be so bad if the MAV blew up.I wouldnt know what hit me, but if I miss the intercept, Ill just float around in space until I run out of air.I have a contingency plan for that.Ill drop the oxygen mixture to zero and breathe pure nitrogen until I suffocate.It wouldnt feel bad.The lungs dont have the ability to sense lack of oxygen.Id just get tired, fall asleep, then die.I still cant quite believe that this is really it.Im really leaving.This frigid desert has been my home for a year and a half.I figured out how to survive, at least for a while, and I got used to how things worked.My terrifying struggle to stay alive became somehow routine.Get up in the morning, eat breakfast, tend my crops, fix broken stuff, eat lunch, answer e mail, watch TV, eat dinner, go to bed.The life of a modern farmer.Then I was a trucker, doing a long haul across the world.And finally, a construction worker, rebuilding a ship in ways no one ever considered before this.Ive done a little of everything here, because Im the only one around to do it.Thats all over now.I have no more jobs to do, and no more nature to defeat.Ive had my last Martian potato.Ive slept in the rover for the last time.Ive left my last footprints in the dusty red sand.Im leaving Mars today, one way or another.About fucking time.Chapter 26   They gathered.Everywhere on Earth, they gathered.In Trafalgar Square and Tiananmen Square and Times Square, they watched on giant screens.In offices, they huddled around computer monitors.In bars, they stared silently at the TV in the corner.In homes, they sat breathlessly on their couches, their eyes glued to the story playing out.In Chicago, a middle aged couple clutched each others hands as they watched.The man held his wife gently as she rocked back and forth out of sheer terror.The NASA representative knew not to disturb them, but stood ready to answer any questions, should they ask.Fuel pressure green, Johanssens voice said from a billion televisions.Engine alignment perfect.Communications five by five.We are ready for preflight checklist, Commander.Copy.Lewiss voice.CAPCOM.Go, Johanssen responded.Guidance.Go, Johanssen said again.Remote Command.Go, said Martinez.Pilot.Go, said Watney from the MAV.A mild cheer coruscated through the crowds worldwide.*  Mitch sat at his station in Mission Control.The controllers monitored everything and were ready to help in any way they could, but the communication latency between Hermes and Earth rendered them powerless to do anything but watch.Telemetry, Lewiss voice said over the speakers.Go, Johanssen responded.Recovery, she continued.Go, said Beck from the airlock.Secondary Recovery.Go, said Vogel from beside Beck.Mission Control, this is Hermes Actual, Lewis reported.We are go for launch and will proceed on schedule.We are T minus four minutes, ten seconds to launch mark.Did you get that, Timekeeper?Mitch said.Affirmative, Flight was the response.Our clocks are synched with theirs.Not that we can do anything, Mitch mumbled, but at least well know whats supposedly happening.*  About four minutes, Mark, Lewis said into her mic.How you doing down there?Eager to get up there, Commander, Watney responded.Were going to make that happen, Lewis said.Remember, youll be pulling some pretty heavy gs.Its okay to pass out.Youre in Martinezs hands.Tell that asshole no barrel rolls.Copy that, MAV, Lewis said.Four more minutes, Martinez said, cracking his knuckles.You ready for some flying, Beth?Yeah, Johanssen said.Itll be strange to sysop a launch and stay in zero g the whole time.I hadnt thought of it that way, Martinez said, but yeah.Im not going to be squashed against the back of my seat.Weird.*  Beck floated in the airlock, tethered to a wall mounted spool.Vogel stood beside him, his boots clamped to the floor.Both stared through the open outer door at the red planet below.Didnt think Id be back here again, Beck said.Yes, Vogel said.We are the first.First what?We are the first to visit Mars twice.Oh yeah.Even Watney cant say that.He cannot.They looked at Mars in silence for a while.Vogel, Beck said.Ja.If I cant reach Mark, I want you to release my tether.Dr.Beck, Vogel said, the commander has said no to this.I know what the commander said, but if I need a few more meters, I want you to cut me loose.I have an MMU, I can get back without a tether.I will not do this, Dr.Beck.Its my own life at risk, and I say its okay.You are not the commander.Beck scowled at Vogel, but with their reflective visors down, the effect was lost.Fine, Beck said.But I bet youll change your mind if push comes to shove.Vogel did not respond.*  T minus ten, said Johanssen, nine eight  Main engines start, said Martinez.seven six five Mooring clamps released  About five seconds, Watney, Lewis said to her headset.Hang on.See you in a few, Commander, Watney radioed back.four three two  *  Watney lay in the acceleration couch as the MAV rumbled in anticipation of liftoff.Hmm, he said to nobody.I wonder how much longer  The MAV launched with incredible force.More than any manned ship had accelerated in the history of space travel.Watney was shoved back into his couch so hard he couldnt even grunt.Having anticipated this, he had placed a folded up shirt behind his head in the helmet.As his head drove ever deeper into the makeshift cushion, the edges of his vision became blurry.He could neither breathe nor move.Directly in his field of view, the Hab canvas patch flapped violently as the ship exponentially gained speed.Concentration became difficult, but something in the back of his mind told him that flapping was bad.*  Velocity seven hundred and forty one meters per second, Johanssen called out.Altitude thirteen hundred and fifty meters.Copy, Martinez said.Thats low, Lewis said.Too low.I know, Martinez said.Its sluggish; fighting me.What the fuck is going on?Velocity eight hundred and fifty, altitude eighteen hundred and forty three, Johanssen said.Im not getting the power I need!Martinez said.Engine power at a hundred percent, Johanssen said.Im telling you its sluggish, Martinez insisted.Watney, Lewis said to her headset.Watney, do you read?Can you report?*  Watney heard Lewiss voice in the distance.Like someone talking to him through a long tunnel.He vaguely wondered what she wanted.His attention was briefly drawn to the fluttering canvas ahead of him.A rip had appeared and was rapidly widening.But then he was distracted by a bolt in one of the bulkheads.It only had five sides.He wondered why NASA decided that bolt needed five sides instead of six.It would require a special wrench to tighten or loosen.The canvas tore even further, the tattered material flapping wildly.Through the opening, Watney saw red sky stretching out infinitely ahead.Thats nice, he thought.As the MAV flew higher, the atmosphere grew thinner.Soon, the canvas stopped fluttering and simply stretched toward Mark.The sky shifted from red to black.Thats nice, too, Mark thought.As consciousness slipped away, he wondered where he could get a cool five sided bolt like that.*  Im getting more response now, Martinez said.Back on track with full acceleration, Johanssen said.Must have been drag.MAVs out of the atmosphere now.It was like flying a cow, Martinez grumbled, his hands racing over his controls.Can you get him up?Lewis asked.Hell get to orbit, Johanssen said, but the intercept course may be compromised.Get him up first, Lewis said.Then well worry about intercept.Copy.Main engine cutoff in fifteen seconds.Totally smooth now, Martinez said.Its not fighting me at all anymore.Well below target altitude, Johanssen said.Velocity is good.How far below?Lewis said.Cant say for sure, Johanssen said.All I have is accelerometer data.Well need radar pings at intervals to work out his true final orbit.Back to automatic guidance, Martinez said.Main shutdown in four, Johanssen said,  three two one Shutdown.Confirm shutdown, Martinez said.Watney, you there?Lewis said.Watney?Watney, do you read?Probably passed out, Commander, Beck said over the radio.He pulled twelve gs on the ascent.Give him a few minutes.Copy, Lewis said.Johanssen, got his orbit yet?I have interval pings.Working out our intercept range and velocity  Martinez and Lewis stared at Johanssen as she brought up the intercept calculation software.Normally, orbits would be worked out by Vogel, but he was otherwise engaged.Johanssen was his backup for orbital dynamics.Intercept velocity will be eleven meters per second she began.I can make that work, Beck said over the radio.Distance at intercept will be Johanssen stopped and choked.Shakily, she continued.Well be sixty eight kilometers apart.She buried her face in her hands.Did she say sixty eight kilometers!?Beck said.Kilometers!?God damn it, Martinez whispered.Keep it together, Lewis said.Work the problem.Martinez, is there any juice in the MAV?Negative, Commander, Martinez responded.They ditched the OMS system to lighten the launch weight.Then well have to go to him.Johanssen, time to intercept?Thirty nine minutes, twelve seconds, Johanssen said, trying not to quaver.Vogel, Lewis continued, how far can we deflect in thirty nine minutes with the ion engines?Perhaps five kilometers, he radioed.Not enough, Lewis said.Martinez, what if we point our attitude thrusters all the same direction?Depends on how much fuel we want to save for attitude adjustments on the trip home.How much do you need?I could get by with maybe twenty percent of whats left.All right, if you used the other eighty percent  Checking, Martinez said, running the numbers on his console.Wed get a delta v of thirty one meters per second.Johanssen, Lewis said.Math.In thirty nine minutes wed deflect Johanssen quickly typed, seventy two kilometers!There we go, Lewis said.How much fuel  Use seventy five point five percent of remaining attitude adjust fuel, Johanssen said.Thatll bring the intercept range to zero.Do it, Lewis said.Aye, Commander, Martinez said.Hold on, Johanssen said.Thatll get the intercept range to zero, but the intercept velocity will be forty two meters per second.Then we have thirty nine minutes to figure out how to slow down, Lewis said.Martinez, burn the jets.Aye, Martinez said.*  Whoa, Annie said to Venkat.A lot of shit just happened really fast.Explain.Venkat strained to hear the audio feed over the murmur of the VIPs in the observation booth.Through the glass, he saw Mitch throw his hands up in frustration.The launch missed badly, Venkat said, looking past Mitch to the screens beyond.The intercept distance was going to be way too big.So theyre using the attitude adjusters to close the gap.What do attitude adjusters usually do?They rotate the ship.Theyre not made for thrusting it.Hermes doesnt have quick reaction engines.Just the slow, steady ion engines.So problem solved?Annie said hopefully.No, Venkat said.Theyll get to him, but theyll be going forty two meters per second when they get there.How fast is that?Annie asked.About ninety miles per hour, Venkat said.Theres no hope of Beck grabbing Watney at that speed.Can they use the attitude adjusters to slow down?They needed a lot of velocity to close the gap in time.They used all the fuel they could spare to get going fast enough.But now they dont have enough fuel to slow down.Venkat frowned.So what can they do?I dont know, he said.And even if I did, I couldnt tell them in time.Well fuck, Annie said.Yeah, Venkat agreed.*  Watney, Lewis said Do you read?Watney?she repeated.Commander, Beck radioed.Hes wearing a surface EVA suit, right?Yeah.It should have a bio monitor, Beck said.And itll be broadcasting.Its not a strong signal; its only designed to go a couple hundred meters to the rover or Hab.But maybe we can pick it up.Johanssen, Lewis said.On it, Johanssen said.I have to look up the frequencies in the tech specs.Gimme a second.Martinez, Lewis continued.Any idea how to slow down?He shook his head.I got nothin, Commander.Were just going too damn fast.Vogel?The ion drive is simply not strong enough, Vogel replied.Theres got to be something, Lewis said.Something we can do.Anything.Got his bio monitor data, Johanssen said.Pulse fifty eight, blood pressure ninety eight over sixty one.Thats not bad, Beck said.Lower than Id like, but hes been in Mars gravity for eighteen months, so its expected.Time to intercept?Lewis asked.Thirty two minutes, Johanssen replied.*  Blissful unconsciousness became foggy awareness which transitioned into painful reality.Watney opened his eyes, then winced at the pain in his chest.Little remained of the canvas.Tatters floated along the edge of the hole it once covered.This granted Watney an unobstructed view of Mars from orbit.The red planets crater pocked surface stretched out seemingly forever, its thin atmosphere a slight blur along the edge.Only eighteen people in history had personally seen this view.Fuck you, he said to the planet below.Reaching toward the controls on his arm, he winced.Trying again, more slowly this time, he activated his radio.MAV to Hermes.Watney!?came the reply.Affirmative.That you, Commander?Watney said.Affirmative.Whats your status?Im on a ship with no control panel, he said.Thats as much as I can tell you.How do you feel?My chest hurts.I think I broke a rib.How are you?Were working on getting you, Lewis said.There was a complication in the launch.Yeah, Watney said, looking out the hole in the ship.The canvas didnt hold.I think it ripped early in the ascent.Thats consistent with what we saw during the launch.How bad is it, Commander?he asked.We were able to correct the intercept range with Hermess attitude thrusters.But theres a problem with the intercept velocity.How big a problem.Forty two meters per second.Well shit.*  Hey, at least hes okay for the moment, Martinez said.Beck, Lewis said, Im coming around to your way of thinking.How fast can you get going if youre untethered?Sorry, Commander, Beck said.I already ran the numbers.At best I could get twenty five meters per second.Even if I could get to forty two, Id need another forty two to match Hermes when I came back.Copy, Lewis said.Hey, Watney said over the radio, Ive got an idea.Of course you do, Lewis said.What do you got?I could find something sharp in here and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit.I could use the escaping air as a thruster and fly my way to you.The source of thrust would be on my arm, so Id be able to direct it pretty easily.How does he come up with this shit?Martinez interjected.Hmm, Lewis said.Could you get forty two meters per second that way?No idea, Watney said.I cant see you having any control if you did that, Lewis said.Youd be eyeballing the intercept and using a thrust vector you can barely control.I admit its fatally dangerous, Watney said.But consider this: Id get to fly around like Iron Man.Well keep working on ideas, Lewis said.Iron Man, Commander.Iron Man.Stand by, Lewis said.She furrowed her brow.Hmm Maybe its not such a bad idea  You kidding, Commander?Martinez said.Its a terrible idea.Hed shoot off into space  Not the whole idea, but part of it, she said.Using atmosphere as thrust.Martinez, get Vogels station up and running.Okay, Martinez said, typing at his keyboard.The screen changed to Vogels workstation.Martinez quickly changed the language from German to English.Its up.What do you need?Vogels got software for calculating course offsets caused by hull breaches, right?Yeah, Martinez said.It estimates course corrections needed in the event of  Yeah, yeah, Lewis said.Fire it up.I want to know what happens if we blow the VAL.Johanssen and Martinez looked at each other.Um.Yes, Commander, Martinez said.The vehicular airlock?Johanssen said.You want to open it?Plenty of air in the ship, Lewis said.Itd give us a good kick.Ye es Martinez said as he brought up the software.And it might blow the nose of the ship off in the process.Also, all the air would leave, Johanssen felt compelled to add.Well seal the bridge and reactor room.We can let everywhere else go vacuo, but we dont want explosive decompression in here or near the reactor.Martinez entered the scenario into the software.I think well just have the same problem as Watney, but on a larger scale.We cant direct that thrust.We dont have to, Lewis said.The VAL is in the nose.Escaping air would make a thrust vector through our center of mass.We just need to point the ship directly away from where we want to go.Okay, I have the numbers, Martinez said.A breach at the VAL, with the bridge and reactor room sealed off, would accelerate us twenty nine meters per second.Wed have a relative velocity of thirteen meters per second afterward, Johanssen supplied.Beck, Lewis radioed.Have you been hearing all this?Affirmative, Commander, Beck said.Can you do thirteen meters per second?Itll be risky, Beck replied.Thirteen to match the MAV, then another thirteen to match Hermes.But its a hell of a lot better than forty two.Johanssen, Lewis said.Time to intercept?Eighteen minutes, Commander.What kind of jolt will we feel with that breach?Lewis asked Martinez.The air will take four seconds to evacuate, he said.Well feel a little less than one g.   Watney, she said to her headset, we have a plan.Yay!A plan!Watney replied.*  Houston, Lewiss voice rang through Mission Control.Be advised we are going to deliberately breach the VAL to produce thrust.What?Mitch said.What!?Oh my god, Venkat said in the observation room.Fuck me raw, Annie said, getting up.I better get to the press room.Any parting knowledge before I go?Theyre going to breach the ship, Venkat said, still dumbfounded.Theyre going to deliberately breach the ship.Oh my god  Got it, Annie said, jogging to the door.*  How will we open the airlock doors?Martinez asked.Theres no way to open them remotely, and if anyones nearby when it blows  Right, Lewis said.We can open one door with the other shut, but how do we open the other?She thought for a moment.Vogel, she radioed.I need you to come back in and make a bomb.Um.Again, please, Commander?Vogel replied.A bomb, Lewis confirmed.Youre a chemist.Can you make a bomb out of stuff on board?Ja, Vogel said.We have flammables and pure oxygen.Sounds good, Lewis said.It is of course dangerous to set off an explosive device on a spacecraft, Vogel pointed out.So make it small, Lewis said.It just needs to poke a hole in the inner airlock door.Any hole will do.If it blows the door off, thats fine.If it doesnt, the air will get out slower, but for longer.The momentum change is the same, and well get the acceleration we need.Pressurizing Airlock 2, Vogel reported.How will we activate this bomb?Johanssen?Lewis said.Uh Johanssen said.She picked up her headset and quickly put it on.Vogel, can you run wires into it?Ja, Vogel said.I will use threaded stopper with a small hole for the wires.It will have little effect on the seal.We could run the wire to Lighting Panel 41, Johanssen said.Its next to the airlock, and I can turn it on and off from here.Theres our remote trigger, Lewis said.Johanssen, go set up the lighting panel.Vogel, get in here and make the bomb.Martinez, go close and seal the doors to the reactor room.Yes, Commander, Johanssen said, kicking off her seat toward the hallway.Commander, Martinez said, pausing at the exit, you want me to bring back some space suits?No point, Lewis said.If the seal on the bridge doesnt hold, well get sucked out at close to the speed of sound.Well be jelly with or without suits on.Hey, Martinez, said Beck over the radio.Can you move my lab mice somewhere safe?Theyre in the bio lab.Its just one cage.Copy, Beck, said Martinez.Ill move them to the reactor room.Are you back in yet, Vogel?Lewis asked.I am just reentering now, Commander.Beck, Lewis said to her headset.Ill need you back in, too.But dont take your suit off.Okay, Beck said.Why?Were going to have to literally blow up one of the doors, Lewis explained.Id rather we kill the inner one.I want the outer door unharmed, so we keep our smooth aerobraking shape.Makes sense, Beck responded as he floated back into the ship.One problem, Lewis said.I want the outer door locked in the fully open position with the mechanical stopper in place to keep it from being trashed by the decompress.You have to have someone in the airlock to do that, Beck said.And you cant open the inner door if the outer door is locked open.Right, Lewis said.So I need you to come back inside, depressurize the VAL, and lock the outer door open.Then youll need to crawl along the hull to get back to Airlock 2.Copy, Commander, Beck said.There are latch points all over the hull.Ill move my tether along, mountain climber style.Get to it, Lewis said.And Vogel, youre in a hurry.You have to make the bomb, set it up, get back to Airlock 2, suit up, depressurize it, and open the outer door, so Beck can get back in when hes done.Hes taking his suit off right now and cant reply, Beck reported, but he heard the order.Watney, how you doing?Lewiss voice said in his ear.Fine so far, Commander, Watney replied.You mentioned a plan?Affirmative, she said.Were going to vent atmosphere to get thrust.How?Were going to blow a hole in the VAL.What!?Watney said.How!?Vogels making a bomb.I knew that guy was a mad scientist!Watney said.I think we should just go with my Iron Man idea.Thats too risky, and you know it, she replied.Thing is, Watney said, Im selfish.I want the memorials back home to be just for me.I dont want the rest of you losers in them.I cant let you guys blow the VAL.Oh, Lewis said, well if you wont let us thenWait wait a minute Im looking at my shoulder patch and it turns out Im the commander.Sit tight.Were coming to get you.Smart ass.*  As a chemist, Vogel knew how to make a bomb.In fact, much of his training was to avoid making them by mistake.The ship had few flammables aboard, due to the fatal danger of fire.But food, by its very nature, contained flammable hydrocarbons.Lacking time to sit down and do the math, he estimated.Sugar has 4000 food calories per kilogram.One food calorie is 4184 Joules.Sugar in zero g will float and the grains will separate, maximizing surface area.In a pure oxygen environment, 16.7 million joules will be released for every kilogram of sugar used, releasing the explosive force of eight sticks of dynamite.Such is the nature of combustion in pure oxygen.Vogel measured the sugar carefully.He poured it into the strongest container he could find, a thick glass beaker.The strength of the container was as important as the explosive.A weak container would simply cause a fireball without much concussive force.A strong container, however, would contain the pressure until it reached true destructive potential.He quickly drilled a hole in the beakers stopper, then stripped a section of wire.He ran the wire through the hole.Sehr gefhrlich, he mumbled as he poured liquid oxygen from the ships supply into the container, then quickly screwed the stopper on.In just a few minutes, he had made a rudimentary pipe bomb.Sehr, sehr, gefhrlich.He floated out of the lab and made his way toward the nose of the ship.*  Johanssen worked on the lighting panel as Beck floated toward the VAL.She grabbed his arm.Be careful crawling along the hull.He turned to face her.Be careful setting up the bomb.She kissed his faceplate then looked away, embarrassed.That was stupid.Dont tell anyone I did that.Dont tell anyone I liked it.Beck smiled.He entered the airlock and sealed the inner door.After depressurizing, he opened the outer door and locked it in place.Grabbing a handrail on the hull, he pulled himself out.Johanssen watched until he was no longer in view, then returned to the lighting panel.She had deactivated it earlier from her workstation.After pulling a length of the cable out and stripping the ends, she fiddled with a roll of electrical tape until Vogel arrived.He showed up just a minute later, carefully floating down the hall with the bomb held in both hands.I have used a single wire for igniting, he explained.I did not want to risk two wires for a spark.It would be dangerous to us if we had static while setting up.How do we set it off?Johanssen said.The wire must reach a high temperature.If you short power through it, that will be sufficient.Ill have to pin the breaker, Johanssen said, but itll work.She twisted the lighting wires onto the bombs and taped them off.Excuse me, Vogel said.I have to return to Airlock 2 to let Dr.Beck back in.Mm, Johanssen said.*  Martinez floated back into the bridge.I had a few minutes, so I ran through the aerobrake lockdown checklist for the reactor room.Everythings ready for acceleration and the compartments sealed off.Good thinking, Lewis said.Prep the attitude correction.Roger, Commander, Martinez said, drifting to his station.The VALs propped open, Becks voice said over the comm.Starting my traverse across the hull.Copy, Lewis said.This calculation is tricky, Martinez said.I need to do everything backward.The VALs in front, so the source of thrust will be exactly opposite to our engines.Our software wasnt expecting us to have an engine there.I just need to tell it we plan to thrust toward Mark.Take your time and get it right, Lewis said.And dont execute till I give you the word.Were not spinning the ship around while Becks out on the hull.Roger, he said.After a moment, he added Okay, the adjustments ready to execute.Stand by, Lewis said.*  Vogel, back in his suit, depressurized Airlock 2 and opened the outer door.Bout time, Beck said, climbing in.Sorry for the delay, Vogel said.I was required to make a bomb.This has been kind of a weird day, Beck said.Commander, Vogel and I are in position.Copy was Lewiss response.Get up against the fore wall of the airlock.Its going to be about one g for four seconds.Make sure youre both tethered in.Copy, Beck said as he attached his tether.The two men pressed themselves against the wall.*  Okay, Martinez, Lewis said, point us the right direction.Copy, said Martinez, executing the attitude adjustment.Johanssen floated into the bridge as the adjustment was performed.The room rotated around her as she reached for a handhold.The bombs ready, and the breakers jammed closed, she said.I can set it off by remotely turning on Lighting Panel 41.Seal the bridge and get to your station, Lewis said.Copy, Johanssen said.Unstowing the emergency seal, she plugged the entrance to the bridge.With a few turns of the crank, the job was done.She returned to her station and ran a quick test.Increasing bridge pressure to 1.03 atmospheres Pressure is steady.We have a good seal.Copy, Lewis said.Time to intercept?Twenty eight seconds, Johanssen said.Wow, Martinez said.We cut that pretty close.You ready, Johanssen?Lewis asked.Yes, Johanssen said.All I have to do is hit enter.Martinez, hows our angle?Dead on, Commander, Martinez reported.Strap in, Lewis said.The three of them tightened the restraints of their chairs.Twenty seconds, Johanssen said.*  Teddy took his seat in the VIP room.Whats the status?Fifteen seconds till they blow the VAL, Venkat said.Where have you been?On the phone with the President, Teddy said.Do you think this will work?I have no idea, Venkat said.Ive never felt this helpless in my life.If its any consolation, Teddy said, pretty much everyone in the world feels the same way.On the other side of the glass, Mitch paced to and fro.*   Five four three Johanssen said.Brace for acceleration, Lewis said.two one Johanssen continued.Activating Lighting Panel 41.She pressed enter.Inside Vogels bomb, the full current of the ships internal lighting system flowed through a thin, exposed wire.It quickly reached the ignition temperature of the sugar.What would have been a minor fizzle in Earths atmosphere became an uncontrolled conflagration in the containers pure oxygen environment.In under one hundred milliseconds, the massive combustion pressure burst the container, and the resulting explosion ripped the airlock door to shreds.The internal air of Hermes rushed through the open VAL, blasting Hermes in the other direction.Vogel and Beck were pressed against the wall of Airlock 2.Lewis, Martinez, and Johanssen endured the acceleration in their seats.It was not a dangerous amount of force.In fact it was less than the force of Earths surface gravity.But it was inconsistent and jerky.After four seconds, the shaking died down and the ship returned to weightlessness.Reactor room still pressurized, Martinez reported.Bridge seal holding, Johanssen said.Obviously.Damage?Martinez said.Not sure yet, Johanssen said.I have External Camera 4 pointed along the nose.I dont see any problems with the hull near the VAL.Worry about that later, Lewis said.Whats our relative velocity and distance to MAV?Johanssen typed quickly.Well get within twenty two meters and were at twelve meters per second.We actually got better than expected thrust.Watney, Lewis said, it worked.Becks on his way.Score!Watney responded.Beck, Lewis said, youre up.Twelve meters per second.Close enough!Beck replied.*  Im going to jump out, Beck said.Should get me another two or three meters per second.Understood, Vogel said, loosely gripping Becks tether.Good luck, Dr.Beck.Placing his feet on the back wall, Beck coiled and leaped out of the airlock.Once free, he got his bearings.A quick look to his right showed him what he could not see from inside the airlock.I have visual!Beck said.I can see the MAV!The MAV barely resembled a spacecraft as Beck had come to know them.The once sleek lines were now a jagged mess of missing hull segments and empty anchor points where noncritical components used to be.Jesus, Mark, what did you do to that thing?You should see what I did to the rover, Watney radioed back.Beck thrust on an intercept course.He had practiced this many times.The presumption in those practice sessions was that hed be rescuing a crewmate whose tether had broken, but the principle was the same.Johanssen, he said, you got me on radar?Affirmative, she replied.Call out my relative velocity to Mark every two seconds or so.Copy.Five point two meters per second.Hey Beck, Watney said, the fronts wide open.Ill get up there and be ready to grab at you.Negative, interrupted Lewis.No untethered movement.Stay strapped to your chair until youre latched to Beck.Copy, Watney said.Three point one meters per second, Johanssen reported.Going to coast for a bit, Beck said.Gotta catch up before I slow it down.He rotated himself in preparation for the next burn.Eleven meters to target, Johanssen said.Copy.Six meters, Johanssen said.Aaaaand counter thrusting, Beck said, firing the MMU thrusters again.The MAV loomed before him.Velocity?he asked.One point one meters per second, Johanssen said.Good enough, he said, reaching for the ship.Im drifting toward it.I think I can get my hand on some of the torn canvas  The tattered canvas beckoned as the only handhold on the otherwise smooth ship.Beck reached, extending as best he could, and managed to grab hold.Contact, Beck said.Strengthening his grip, he pulled his body forward and lashed out with his other hand to grab more canvas.Firm contact!Dr.Beck, Vogel said, we have passed closest approach point and you are now getting further away.You have one hundred and sixty nine meters of tether left.Enough for fourteen seconds.Copy, Beck said.Pulling his head to the opening, he looked inside the compartment to see Watney strapped to his chair.Visual on Watney!he reported.Visual on Beck!Watney reported.How ya doin, man?Beck said, pulling himself into the ship.I I just Watney said.Give me a minute.Youre the first person Ive seen in eighteen months.We dont have a minute, Beck said, kicking off the wall.Weve got eleven seconds before we run out of tether.Becks course took him to the chair, where he clumsily collided with Watney.The two gripped each others arms to keep Beck from bouncing away.Contact with Watney!Beck said.Eight seconds, Dr.Beck, Vogel radioed.Copy, Beck said as he hastily latched the front of his suit to the front of Watneys with tether clips.Connected, he said.Watney released the straps on his chair.Restraints off.Were outa here, Beck said, kicking off the chair toward the opening.The two men floated across the MAV cabin to the opening.Beck reached out his arm and pushed off the edge as they passed through.Were out, Beck reported.Five seconds, Vogel said.Relative velocity to Hermes: twelve meters per second, Johanssen said.Thrusting, Beck said, activating his MMU.The two accelerated toward Hermes for a few seconds.Then the MMU controls on Becks heads up display turned red.Thats it for the fuel, Beck said.Velocity?Five meters per second, Johanssen replied.Stand by, Vogel said.Throughout the process, he had been feeding tether out of the airlock.Now he gripped the ever shrinking remainder of the rope with both hands.He didnt clamp down on it; that would pull him out of the airlock.He simply closed his hands over the tether to create friction.Hermes was now pulling Beck and Watney along, with Vogels use of the tether acting as a shock absorber.If Vogel used too much force, the shock of it would pull the tether free from Becks suit clips.If he used too little, the tether would run out before they matched speeds, then jerk to a hard stop at the end, which would also rip it out of Becks suit clips.Vogel managed to find the balance.After a few seconds of tense, gut feel physics, he felt the force on the tether abate.Velocity zero!Johanssen reported excitedly.Reel em in, Vogel, Lewis said.Copy, Vogel said.Hand over hand, he slowly pulled his crewmates toward the airlock.After a few seconds, he stopped actively pulling and simply took in the line as they coasted toward him.They floated into the airlock, and Vogel grabbed them.Beck and Watney both reached for handholds on the wall as Vogel worked his way around them and closed the outer door.Aboard!Beck said.Airlock 2 outer door closed, Vogel said.Yes!Martinez yelled.Copy, Lewis said.*  Lewiss voice echoed across the world: Houston, this is Hermes Actual.Six crew safely aboard.The control room exploded with applause.Leaping from their seats, controllers cheered, hugged, and cried.The same scene played out all over the world, in parks, bars, civic centers, living rooms, classrooms, and offices.The couple in Chicago clutched each other in sheer relief, then pulled the NASA representative in for a group hug.Mitch slowly pulled off his headset and turned to face the VIP room.Through the glass, he saw various well suited men and women cheering wildly.He looked at Venkat and let out a heavy sigh of relief.Venkat put his head in his hands and whispered, Thank the gods.Teddy pulled a blue folder from his briefcase and stood.Annie will be wanting me in the press room.Guess you dont need the red folder today, Venkat said.Honestly, I didnt make one.As he walked out he added, Good work, Venk.Now, get them home.LOG ENTRY: MISSION DAY 687  That 687 caught me off guard for a minute.On Hermes, we track time by mission days.It may be Sol 549 down on Mars, but its Mission Day 687 up here.And you know what?It doesnt matter what time it is on Mars because Im not there!Oh my god.Im really not on Mars anymore.I can tell because theres no gravity and there are other humans around.Im still adjusting.If this were a movie, everyone would have been in the airlock, and there would have been high fives all around.But it didnt pan out that way.I broke two ribs during the MAV ascent.They were sore the whole time, but they really started screaming when Vogel pulled us into the airlock by the tether.I didnt want to distract the people who were saving my life, so I muted my mic and screamed like a little girl.Its true, you know.In space, no one can hear you scream like a little girl.Once they got me into Airlock 2, they opened the inner door and I was finally aboard again.Hermes was still in vacuo, so we didnt have to cycle the airlock.Beck told me to go limp and pushed me down the corridor toward his quarters (which serve as the ships sick bay when needed).Vogel went the other direction and closed the outer VAL door.Once Beck and I got to his quarters, we waited for the ship to repressurize.Hermes had enough spare air to refill the ship two more times if needed.Itd be a pretty shitty long range ship if it couldnt recover from a decompression.After Johanssen gave us the all clear, Dr.Bossy Beck made me wait while he first took off his suit, then took off mine.After he pulled my helmet off, he looked shocked.I thought maybe I had a major head wound or something, but it turns out it was the smell.Its been a while since I washed anything.After that, it was X rays and chest bandages while the rest of the crew checked the ship for damage.Then came the (painful) high fives, followed by people staying as far away from my stench as possible.We had a few minutes of reunion before Beck shuttled everyone out.He gave me painkillers and told me to shower as soon as I could move my arms.So now Im waiting for the drugs to kick in.I think about the sheer number of people who pulled together just to save my sorry ass, and I can barely comprehend it.My crewmates sacrificed a year of their lives to come back for me.Countless people at NASA worked day and night to invent rover and MAV modifications.All of JPL busted their asses to make a probe that was destroyed on launch.Then, instead of giving up, they made another probe to resupply Hermes.The China National Space Administration abandoned a project theyd worked on for years just to provide a booster.The cost for my survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars.All to save one dorky botanist.Why bother?Well, okay.I know the answer to that.Part of it might be what I represent: progress, science, and the interplanetary future weve dreamed of for centuries.But really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out.It might not seem that way sometimes, but its true.If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search.If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood.If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies.This is so fundamentally human that its found in every culture without exception.Yes, there are assholes who just dont care, but theyre massively outnumbered by the people who do.And because of that, I had billions of people on my side.Pretty cool, eh?Anyway, my ribs hurt like hell, my vision is still blurry from acceleration sickness, Im really hungry, itll be another 211 days before Im back on Earth, and, apparently, I smell like a skunk took a shit on some sweat socks.This is the happiest day of my life.
