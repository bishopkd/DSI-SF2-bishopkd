Order in Council, this date, etcetera, etcetera. ""What of the Ixian concern about the tax, m'Lord?"Stilgar asked.Paul forced his attention away from the brooding, angry look on Korba's face, said: "You've a proposal, Stil?""We must have control of taxes, Sire. ""Our price to the Guild for my signature on the Tupile Treaty," Paul said, "is the submission of the Ixian Confederacy to our tax.The Confederacy cannot trade without Guild transport.They'll pay. ""Very good, m'Lord. "Stilgar produced another folder, cleared his throat."The Qizarate's report on Salusa Secundus.Irulan's father has been putting his legions through landing maneuvers. "Irulan found something of interest in the palm of her left hand.A pulse throbbed at her neck."Irulan," Paul asked, "do you persist in arguing that your father's one legion is nothing more than a toy?""What could he do with only one legion?"she asked.She stared at him out of slitted eyes."He could get himself killed," Chani said.Paul nodded."And I'd be blamed. ""I know a few commanders in the Jihad," Alia said, "who'd pounce if they learned of this. ""But it's only his police force!"Irulan protested."Then they have no need for landing maneuvers," Paul said."I suggest that your next little note to your father contain a frank and direct discussion of my views about his delicate position. "She lowered her gaze."Yes, m'Lord.I hope that will be the end of it.My father would make a good martyr. ""Mmmmmm," Paul said."My sister wouldn't send a message to those commanders she mentioned unless I ordered it. ""An attack on my father carries dangers other than the obvious military ones," Irulan said."People are beginning to look back on his reign with a certain nostalgia. ""You'll go too far one day," Chani said in her deadly serious Fremen voice."Enough!"Paul ordered.He weighed Irulan's revelation about public nostalgia   ah, now!that'd carried a note of truth.Once more, Irulan had proved her worth."The Bene Gesserit send a formal supplication," Stilgar said, presenting another folder."They wish to consult you about the preservation of your bloodline. "Chani glanced sideways at the folder as though it contained a deadly device."Send the Sisterhood the usual excuses," Paul said."Must we?"Irulan demanded."Perhaps...this is the time to discuss it," Chani said.Paul shook his head sharply.They couldn't know that this was part of the price he had not yet decided to pay.But Chani wasn't to be stopped."I have been to the prayer wall of Sietch Tabr where I was born," she said."I have submitted to doctors.I have knelt in the desert and sent my thoughts into the depths where dwells Shai hulud.Yet"   she shrugged   "nothing avails. "Science and superstition, all have failed her, Paul thought.Do I fail her, too, by not telling her what bearing an heir to House Atreides will precipitate?He looked up to find an expression of pity in Alia's eyes.The idea of pity from his sister repelled him.Had she, too, seen that terrifying future?"My Lord must know the dangers to his realm when he has no heir," Irulan said, using her Bene Gesserit powers of voice with an oily persuasiveness."These things are naturally difficult to discuss, but they must be brought into the open.An Emperor is more than a man.His figure leads the realm.Should he die without an heir, civil strife must follow.As you love your people, you cannot leave them thus?"Paul pushed himself away from the table, strode to the balcony windows.A wind was flattening the smoke of the city's fires out there.The sky presented a darkening silver blue softened by the evening fall of dust from the Shield Wall.He stared southward at the escarpment which protected his northern lands from the coriolis wind, and he wondered why his own peace of mind could find no such shield.The Council sat silently waiting behind him, aware of how close to rage he was.Paul sensed time rushing upon him.He tried to force himself into a tranquility of many balances where he might shape a new future.Disengage...disengage...disengage, he thought.What would happen if he took Chani, just picked up and left with her, sought sanctuary on Tupile?His name would remain behind.The Jihad would find new and more terrible centers upon which to turn.He'd be blamed for that, too.He felt suddenly fearful that in reaching for any new thing he might let fall what was most precious, that even the slightest noise from him might send the universe crashing back, receding until he never could recapture any piece of it.Below him, the square had become the setting for a band of pilgrims in the green and white of the hajj.They wended their way like a disjointed snake behind a striding Arrakeen guide.They reminded Paul that his reception hall would be packed with supplicants by now.Pilgrims!Their exercise in homelessness had become a disgusting source of wealth for his Imperium.The hajj filled the spaceways with religious tramps.They came and they came and they came.How did I set this in motion?he asked himself.It had, of course, set itself in motion.It was in the genes which might labor for centuries to achieve this brief spasm.Driven by that deepest religious instinct, the people came, seeking their resurrection.The pilgrimage ended here   "Arrakis, the place of rebirth, the place to die. "Snide old Fremen said he wanted the pilgrims for their water.What was it the pilgrims really sought?Paul wondered.They said they came to a holy place.But they must know the universe contained no Eden source, no Tupile for the soul.They called Arrakis the place of the unknown where all mysteries were explained.This was a link between their universe and the next.And the frightening thing was that they appeared to go away satisfied.What do they find here?Paul asked himself.Often in their religious ecstasy, they filled the streets with screeching like some odd aviary.In fact, the Fremen called them "passage birds. "And the few who died here were "winged souls. "With a sigh, Paul thought how each new planet his legions subjugated opened new sources of pilgrims.They came out of gratitude for "the peace of Muad'dib. "Everywhere there is peace, Paul thought.Everywhere...except in the heart of Muad'dib.He felt that some element of himself lay immersed in frosty hoar darkness without end.His prescient power had tampered with the image of the universe held by all mankind.He had shaken the safe cosmos and replaced security with his Jihad.He had out fought and out thought and out predicted the universe of men, but a certainty filled him that this universe still eluded him.This planet beneath him which he had commanded be remade from desert into a water rich paradise, it was alive.It had a pulse as dynamic as that of any human.It fought him, resisted, slipped away from his commands...A hand crept into Paul's.He looked down to see Chani peering up at him, concern in her eyes.Those eyes drank him, and she whispered: "Please, love, do not battle with your ruh self. "An outpouring of emotion swept upward from her hand, buoyed him."Sihaya," he whispered."We must go to the desert soon," she said in a low voice.He squeezed her hand, released it, returned to the table where he remained standing.Chani took her seat.Irulan stared at the papers in front of Stilgar, her mouth a tight line."Irulan proposes herself as mother of the Imperial heir," Paul said.He glanced at Chani, back to Irulan, who refused to meet his gaze."We all know she holds no love for me. "Irulan went very still."I know the political arguments," Paul said."It's the human arguments which concern me.I think if the Princess Consort were not bound by the commands of the Bene Gesserit, if she did not seek this out of desires for personal power, my reaction might be very different.As matters stand, though, I reject this proposal. "Irulan took a deep, shaky breath.Paul, resuming his seat, thought he had never seen her under such poor control.Leaning toward her, he said: "Irulan, I am truly sorry. "She lifted her chin, a look of pure fury in her eyes."I don't want your pity!"she hissed.And turning to Stilgar: "Is there more that's urgent and dire?"Holding his gaze firmly on Paul, Stilgar said: "One more matter, m'Lord.The Guild again proposes a formal embassy here on Arrakis. ""One of the deep space kind?"Korba asked, his voice full of fanatic loathing."Presumably," Stilgar said."A matter to be considered with the utmost care, m'Lord," Korba warned."The Council of Naibs would not like it, an actual Guildsman here on Arrakis.They contaminate the very ground they touch. ""They live in tanks and don't touch the ground," Paul said, letting his voice reveal irritation."The Naibs might take matters into their own hands, m'Lord," Korba said.Paul glared at him."They are Fremen, after all, m'Lord," Korba insisted."We well remember how the Guild brought those who oppressed us.We have not forgotten the way they blackmailed a spice ransom from us to keep our secrets from our enemies.They drained us of every  "  "Enough!"Paul snapped."Do you think I have forgotten?"As though he had just awakened to the import of his own words, Korba stuttered unintelligibly, then: "M'lord, forgive me.I did not mean to imply you are not Fremen.I did not... ""They'll send a Steersman," Paul said."It isn't likely a Steersman would come here if he could see danger in it. "Her mouth dry with sudden fear, Irulan said: "You've...seen a Steersman come here?""Of course I haven't seen a Steersman," Paul said, mimicking her tone."But I can see where one's been and where one's going.Let them send us a Steersman.Perhaps I have a use for such a one. ""So ordered," Stilgar said.And Irulan, hiding a smile behind her hand, thought: It's true then.Our Emperor cannot see a Steersman.They are mutually blind.The conspiracy is hidden.= = = = = =   "Once more the drama begins. "The Emperor Paul Muad'dib on his ascension to the Lion Throne   Alia peered down from her spy window into the great reception hall to watch the advance of the Guild entourage.The sharply silver light of noon poured through clerestory windows onto a floor worked in green, blue and eggshell tiles to simulate a bayou with water plants and, here and there, a splash of exotic color to indicate bird or animal.Guildsmen moved across the tile pattern like hunters stalking their prey in a strange jungle.They formed a moving design of gray robes, black robes, orange robes   all arrayed in a deceptively random way around the transparent tank where the Steersman Ambassador swam in his orange gas.The tank slid on its supporting field, towed by two gray robed attendants, like a rectangular ship being warped into its dock.Directly beneath her, Paul sat on the Lion Throne on its raised dais.He wore the new formal crown with its fish and fist emblems.The jeweled golden robes of state covered his body.The shimmering of a personal shield surrounded him.Two wings of bodyguards fanned out on both sides along the dais and down the steps.Stilgar stood two steps below Paul's right hand in a white robe with a yellow rope for a belt.Sibling empathy told her that Paul seethed with the same agitation she was experiencing, although she doubted another could detect it.His attention remained on an orange robed attendant whose blindly staring metal eyes looked neither to right nor to left.This attendant walked at the right front corner of the Ambassador's troupe like a military outrider.A rather flat face beneath curly black hair, such of his figure as could be seen beneath the orange robe, every gesture shouted a familiar identity.It was Duncan Idaho.It could not be Duncan Idaho, yet it was.Captive memories absorbed in the womb during the moment of her mother's spice change identified this man for Alia by a rihani decipherment which cut through all camouflage.Paul was seeing him, she knew, out of countless personal experiences, out of gratitudes and youthful sharing.It was Duncan.Alia shuddered.There could be only one answer: this was a Tleilaxu ghola, a being reconstructed from the dead flesh of the original.That original had perished saving Paul.This could only be a product of the axolotl tanks.The ghola walked with the cock footed alertness of a master swordsman.He came to a halt as the Ambassador's tank glided to a stop ten paces from the steps of the dais.In the Bene Gesserit way she could not escape, Alia read Paul's disquiet.He no longer looked at the figure out of his past.Not looking, his whole being stared.Muscles strained against restrictions as he nodded to the Guild Ambassador, said: "I am told your name is Edric.We welcome you to our Court in the hope this will bring new understanding between us. "The Steersman assumed a sybaritic reclining pose in his orange gas, popped a melange capsule into his mouth before meeting Paul's gaze.The tiny transducer orbiting a corner of the Guildsman's tank reproduced a coughing sound, then the rasping, uninvolved voice: "I abase myself before my Emperor and beg leave to present my credentials and offer a small gift. "An aide passed a scroll up to Stilgar, who studied it, scowling, then nodded to Paul.Both Stilgar and Paul turned then toward the ghola standing patiently below the dais."Indeed my Emperor has discerned the gift," Edric said."We are pleased to accept your credentials," Paul said."Explain the gift. "Edric rolled in the tank, bringing his attention to bear on the ghola."This is a man called Hayt," he said, spelling the name."According to our investigators, he has a most curious history.He was killed here on Arrakis...a grievous head wound which required many months of regrowth.The body was sold to the Bene Tleilax as that of a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz School.It came to our attention that this must be Duncan Idaho, the trusted retainer of your household.We bought him as a gift befitting an Emperor. "Edric peered up at Paul."Is it not Idaho, Sire?"Restraint and caution gripped Paul's voice."He has the aspect of Idaho. "Does Paul see something I don't?Alia wondered.No!It's Duncan!The man called Hayt stood impassively, metal eyes fixed straight ahead, body relaxed.No sign escaped him to indicate he knew himself to be the object of discussion."According to our best knowledge, it's Idaho," Edric said."He's called Hayt now," Paul said."A curious name. ""Sire, there's no divining how or why the Tleilaxu bestow names," Edric said."But names can be changed.The Tleilaxu name is of little importance. "This is a Tleilaxu thing, Paul thought.There's the problem.The Bene Tleilax held little attachment to phenomenal nature.Good and evil carried strange meanings in their philosophy.What might they have incorporated in Idaho's flesh   out of design or whim?Paul glanced at Stilgar, noted the Fremen's superstitious awe.It was an emotion echoed all through his Fremen guard.Stilgar's mind would be speculating about the loathsome habits of Guildsmen, of Tleilaxu and of gholas.Turning toward the ghola, Paul said: "Hayt, is that your only name?"A serene smile spread over the ghola's dark features.The metal eyes lifted, centered on Paul, but maintained their mechanical stare."That is how I am called, my Lord: Hayt. "In her dark spy hole, Alia trembled.It was Idaho's voice, a quality of sound so precise she sensed its imprint upon her cells."May it please my Lord," the ghola added, "if I say his voice gives me pleasure.This is a sign, say the Bene Tleilax, that I have heard the voice...before. ""But you don't know this for sure," Paul said."I know nothing of my past for sure, my Lord.It was explained that I can have no memory of my former life.All that remains from before is the pattern set by the genes.There are, however, niches into which once familiar things may fit.There are voices, places, foods, faces, sounds, actions   a sword in my hand, the controls of a 'thopter...  "Noting how intently the Guildsmen watched this exchange, Paul asked: "Do you understand that you're a gift?""It was explained to me, my Lord. "Paul sat back, hands resting on the arms of the throne.What debt do I owe Duncan's flesh?he wondered.The man died saving my life.But this is not Idaho, this is a ghola.Yet, here were body and mind which had taught Paul to fly a 'thopter as though the wings grew from his own shoulders.Paul knew he could not pick up a sword without leaning on the harsh education Idaho had given him.A ghola.This was flesh full of false impressions, easily misread.Old associations would persist.Duncan Idaho.It wasn't so much a mask the ghola wore as it was a loose, concealing garment of personality which moved in a way different from whatever the Tleilaxu had hidden here."How might you serve us?"Paul asked."In any way my Lord's wishes and my capabilities agree. "Alia, watching from her vantage point, was touched by the ghola's air of diffidence.She detected nothing feigned.Something ultimately innocent shone from the new Duncan Idaho.The original had been worldly, devil may care.But this flesh had been cleansed of all that.It was a pure surface upon which the Tleilaxu had written...what?She sensed the hidden perils in this gift then.This was a Tleilaxu thing.The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created.Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions.They boasted they could make anything from the proper human raw material   devils or saints.They sold killer mentats.They'd produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions against the taking of human life to do it.Their wares included willing menials, pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an occasional moralist.Paul stirred, looked at Edric."How has this gift been trained?"he asked."If it please my Lord," Edric said, "it amused the Tleilaxu to train this ghola as a mentat and philosopher of the Zensunni.Thus, they sought to increase his abilities with the sword. ""Did they succeed?""I do not know, my Lord. "Paul weighed the answer.Truthsense told him Edric sincerely believed the ghola to be Idaho.But there was more.The waters of Time through which this oracular Steersman moved suggested dangers without revealing them.Hayt.The Tleilaxu name spoke of peril.Paul felt himself tempted to reject the gift.Even as he felt the temptation, he knew he couldn't choose that way.This flesh made demands on House Atreides   a fact the enemy well knew."Zensunni philosopher," Paul mused, once more looking at the ghola."You've examined your own role and motives?""I approach my service in an attitude of humility, Sire.I am a cleansed mind washed free of the imperatives from my human past. ""Would you prefer we called you Hayt or Duncan Idaho?""My Lord may call me what he wishes, for I am not a name. ""But do you enjoy the name Duncan Idaho?""I think that was my name, Sire.It fits within me.Yet...it stirs up curious responses.One's name, I think, must carry much that's unpleasant along with the pleasant. ""What gives you the most pleasure?"Paul asked.Unexpectedly, the ghola laughed, said: "Looking for signs in others which reveal my former self. ""Do you see such signs here?""Oh, yes, my Lord.Your man Stilgar there is caught between suspicion and admiration.He was friend to my former self, but this ghola flesh repels him.You, my Lord, admired the man I was...and you trusted him. ""Cleansed mind," Paul said."How can a cleansed mind put itself in bondage to us?""Bondage, my Lord?The cleansed mind makes decisions in the presence of unknowns and without cause and effect.Is this bondage?"Paul scowled.It was a Zensunni saying, cryptic, apt   immersed in a creed which denied objective function in all mental activity.Without cause and effect!Such thoughts shocked the mind.Unknowns?Unknowns lay in every decision, even in the oracular vision."You'd prefer we called you Duncan Idaho?"Paul asked."We live by differences, my Lord.Choose a name for me. ""Let your Tleilaxu name stand," Paul said."Hayt   there's a name inspires caution. "Hayt bowed, moved back one step.And Alia wondered: How did he know the interview was over?I knew it because I know my brother.But there was no sign a stranger could read.Did the Duncan Idaho in him know?Paul turned toward the Ambassador, said: "Quarters have been set aside for your embassy.It is our desire to have a private consultation with you at the earliest opportunity.We will send for you.Let us inform you further, before you hear it from an inaccurate source, that a Reverend Mother of the Sisterhood, Gaius Helen Mohiam, has been removed from the heighliner which brought you.It was done at our command.Her presence on your ship will be an item in our talks. "A wave of Paul's left hand dismissed the envoy."Hayt," Paul said, "stay here. "The Ambassador's attendants backed away, towing the tank.Edric became orange motion in orange gas   eyes, a mouth, gently waving limbs.Paul watched until the last Guildsman was gone, the great doors swinging closed behind them.I've done it now, Paul thought.I've accepted the ghola.The Tleilaxu creation was bait, no doubt of it.Very likely the old hag of a Reverend Mother played the same role.But it was the time of the tarot which he'd forecast in an early vision.The damnable tarot!It muddied the waters of Time until the prescient strained to detect moments but an hour off.Many a fish took the bait and escaped, he reminded himself.And the tarot worked for him as well as against him.What he could not see, others might not detect as well.The ghola stood, head cocked to one side, waiting.Stilgar moved across the steps, hid the ghola from Paul's view.In Chakobsa, the hunting language of their sietch days, Stilgar said: "That creature in the tank gives me the shudders, Sire, but this gift!Send it away!"In the same tongue, Paul said: "I cannot. ""Idaho's dead," Stilgar argued."This isn't Idaho.Let me take its water for the tribe. ""The ghola is my problem, Stil.Your problem is our prisoner.I want the Reverend Mother guarded most carefully by the men I trained to resist the wiles of Voice. ""I like this not, Sire. ""I'll be cautious, Stil.See that you are, too. ""Very well, Sire. "Stilgar stepped down to the floor of the hall, passed close to Hayt, sniffed him and strode out.Evil can be detected by its smell, Paul thought.Stilgar had planted the green and white Atreides banner on a dozen worlds, but remained superstitious Fremen, proof against any sophistication.Paul studied the gift."Duncan, Duncan," he whispered."What have they done to you?""They gave me life, m'Lord," Hayt said."But why were you trained and given to us?"Paul asked.Hayt pursed his lips, then: "They intend me to destroy you. "The statement's candor shook Paul.But then, how else could a Zensunni mentat respond?Even in a ghola, a mentat could speak no less than the truth, especially out of Zensunni inner calm.This was a human computer, mind and nervous system fitted to the tasks relegated long ago to hated mechanical devices.To condition him also as a Zensunni meant a double ration of honesty...unless the Tleilaxu had built something even more odd into this flesh.Why, for example, the mechanical eyes?Tleilaxu boasted their metal eyes improved on the original.Strange, then, that more Tleilaxu didn't wear them out of choice.Paul glanced up at Alia's spy hole, longed for her presence and advice, for counsel not clouded by feelings of responsibility and debt.Once more, he looked at the ghola.This was no frivolous gift.It gave honest answers to dangerous questions.It makes no difference that I know this is a weapon to be used against me, Paul thought."What should I do to protect myself from you?"Paul asked.It was direct speech, no royal "we," but a question as he might have put it to the old Duncan Idaho."Send me away, m'Lord. "Paul shook his head from side to side."How are you to destroy me?"Hayt looked at the guards, who'd moved closer to Paul after Stilgar's departure.He turned, cast his gaze around the hall, brought his metal eyes back to bear on Paul, nodded."This is a place where a man draws away from people," Hayt said."It speaks of such power that one can contemplate it comfortably only in the remembrance that all things are finite.Did my Lord's oracular powers plot his course into this place?"Paul drummed his fingers against the throne's arms.The mentat sought data, but the question disturbed him."I came to this position by strong decisions...not always out of my other...abilities. ""Strong decisions," Hayt said."These temper a man's life.One can take the temper from fine metal by heating it and allowing it to cool without quenching. ""Do you divert me with Zensunni prattle?"Paul asked."Zensunni has other avenues to explore, Sire, than diversion and display. "Paul wet his lips with his tongue, drew in a deep breath, set his own thoughts into the counterbalance poise of the mentat.Negative answers arose around him.It wasn't expected that he'd go haring after the ghola to the exclusion of other duties.No, that wasn't it.Why a Zensunni mentat?Philosophy...words...contemplation...inward searching...He felt the weakness of his data."We need more data," he muttered."The facts needed by a mentat do not brush off onto one as you might gather pollen on your robe while passing through a field of flowers," Hayt said."One chooses his pollen carefully, examines it under powerful amplification. ""You must teach me this Zensunni way with rhetoric," Paul said.The metallic eyes glittered at him for a moment, then: "M'Lord, perhaps that's what was intended. "To blunt my will with words and ideas?Paul wondered."Ideas are most to feared when they become actions," Paul said."Send me away, Sire," Hayt said, and it was Duncan Idaho's voice full of concern for "the young master. "Paul felt trapped by that voice.He couldn't send that voice away, even when it came from a ghola."You will stay," he said, "and we'll both exercise caution. "Hayt bowed in submission.Paul glanced up at the spy hole, eyes pleading for Alia to take this gift off his hands and ferret out its secrets.Gholas were ghosts to frighten children.He'd never thought to know one.To know this one, he had to set himself above all compassion...and he wasn't certain he could do it.Duncan...Duncan...Where was Idaho in this shaped to measure flesh?It wasn't flesh...it was a shroud in fleshly shape!Idaho lay dead forever on the floor of an Arrakeen cavern.His ghost stared out of metal eyes.Two beings stood side by side in this revenant flesh.One was a threat with its force and nature hidden behind unique veils.Closing his eyes, Paul allowed old visions to sift through his awareness.He sensed the spirits of love and hate spouting there in a rolling sea from which no rock lifted above the chaos.No place at all from which to survey turmoil.Why has no vision shown me this new Duncan Idaho?he asked himself.What concealed Time from an oracle?Other oracles, obviously.Paul opened his eyes, asked: "Hayt, do you have the power of prescience?""No, m'Lord. "Sincerity spoke in that voice.It was possible the ghola didn't know he possessed this ability, of course.But that'd hamper his working as a mentat.What was the hidden design?Old visions surged around Paul.Would he have to choose the terrible way?Distorted Time hinted at this ghola in that hideous future.Would that way close in upon him no matter what he did?Disengage...disengage...disengage...The thought tolled in his mind.In her position above Paul, Alia sat with chin cupped in left hand, stared down at the ghola.A magnetic attraction about this Hayt reached up to her.Tleilaxu restoration had given him youth, an innocent intensity which called out to her.She'd understood Paul's unspoken plea.When oracles failed, one turned to real spies and physical powers.She wondered, though, at her own eagerness to accept this challenge.She felt a positive desire to be near this new man, perhaps to touch him.He's a danger to both of us, she thought.= = = = = =   Truth suffers from too much analysis.Ancient Fremen Saying   "Reverend Mother, I shudder to see you in such circumstances," Irulan said.She stood just inside the cell door, measuring the various capacities of the room in her Bene Gesserit way.It was a three meter cube carved with cutterays from the veined brown rock beneath Paul's Keep.For furnishings, it contained one flimsy basket chair occupied now by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, a pallet with a brown cover upon which had been spread a deck of the new Dune Tarot cards, a metered water tap above a reclamation basin, a Fremen privy with moisture seals.It was all sparse, primitive.Yellow light came from anchored and caged glowglobes at the four corners of the ceiling."You've sent word to the Lady Jessica?"the Reverend Mother asked."Yes, but I don't expect her to lift one finger against her firstborn," Irulan said.She glanced at the cards.They spoke of the powerful turning their backs on supplicants.The card of the Great Worm lay beneath Desolate Sand.Patience was counseled.Did one require the tarot to see this?she asked herself.A guard stood outside watching them through a metaglass window in the door.Irulan knew there'd be other monitors on this encounter.She had put in much thought and planning before daring to come here.To have stayed away carried its own perils, though.The Reverend Mother had been engaged in prajna meditation interspersed with examinations of the tarot.Despite a feeling that she would never leave Arrakis alive, she had achieved a measure of calm through this.One's oracular powers might be small, but muddy water was muddy water.And there was always the Litany Against Fear.She had yet to assimilate the import of the actions which had precipitated her into this cell.Dark suspicions brooded in her mind (and the tarot hinted at confirmations).Was it possible the Guild had planned this?A yellow robed Qizara, head shaved for a turban, beady eyes of total blue in a bland round face, skin leathered by the wind and sun of Arrakis, had awaited her on the heighliner's reception bridge.He had looked up from a bulb of spice coffee being served by an obsequious steward, studied her a moment, put down the coffee bulb."You are the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?"To replay those words in her mind was to bring that moment alive in the memory.Her throat had constricted with an unmanageable spasm of fear.How had one of the Emperor's minions learned of her presence on the heighliner?"It came to our attention that you were aboard," the Qizara said."Have you forgotten that you are denied permission to set foot on the holy planet?""I am not on Arrakis," she said."I'm a passenger on a Guild heighliner in free space. ""There is no such thing as free space, Madame. "She read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone."Muad'dib rules everywhere," he said."Arrakis is not my destination," she insisted."Arrakis is the destination of everyone," he said.And she feared for a moment that he would launch into a recital of the mystical itinerary which pilgrims followed.(This very ship had carried thousands of them. )But the Qizara had pulled a golden amulet from beneath his robe, kissed it, touched it to his forehead and placed it to his right ear, listened.Presently, he restored the amulet to its hidden place."You are ordered to gather your luggage and accompany me to Arrakis. ""But I have business elsewhere!"In that moment, she suspected Guild perfidy...or exposure through some transcendent power of the Emperor or his sister.Perhaps the Steersman did not conceal the conspiracy, after all.The abomination, Alia, certainly possessed the abilities of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother.What happened when those powers were coupled with the forces which worked in her brother?"At once!"the Qizara snapped.Everything in her cried out against setting foot once more on that accursed desert planet.Here was where the Lady Jessica had turned against the Sisterhood.Here was where they'd lost Paul Atreides, the kwisatz haderach they'd sought through long generations of careful breeding."At once," she agreed."There's little time," the Qizara said."When the Emperor commands, all his subjects obey. "So the order had come from Paul!She thought of protesting to the heighliner's Navigator Commander, but the futility of such a gesture stopped her.What could the Guild do?"The Emperor has said I must die if I set foot on Dune," she said, making a last desperate effort."You spoke of this yourself.You are condemning me if you take me down there. ""Say no more," the Qizara ordered."The thing is ordained. "That was how they always spoke of Imperial commands, she knew.Ordained!The holy ruler whose eyes could pierce the future had spoken.What must be must be.He had seen it, had He not?With the sick feeling that she was caught in a web of her own spinning, she had turned to obey.And the web had become a cell which Irulan could visit.She saw that Irulan had aged somewhat since their meeting on Wallach IX.New lines of worry spread from the corners of her eyes.Well...time to see if this Sister of the Bene Gesserit could obey her vows."I've had worse quarters," the Reverend Mother said."Do you come from the Emperor?"And she allowed her fingers to move as though in agitation.Irulan read the moving fingers and her own fingers flashed an answer as she spoke, saying: "No   I came as soon as I heard you were here. ""Won't the Emperor be angry?"the Reverend Mother asked.Again, her fingers moved: imperative, pressing, demanding."Let him be angry.You were my teacher in the Sisterhood, just as you were the teacher of his own mother.Does he think I will turn my back on you as she has done?"And Irulan's finger talk made excuses, begged.The Reverend Mother sighed.On the surface, it was the sigh of a prisoner bemoaning her fate, but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on Irulan.It was futile to hope the Atreides Emperor's precious gene pattern could be preserved through this instrument.No matter her beauty, this Princess was flawed.Under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more interested in words than in actions.Irulan was still a Bene Gesserit, though, and the Sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out.Beneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother sister crossbreeding must be explored.(Irulan almost broke at receiving this command. )"I must have my chance!"Irulan's fingers pleaded."You've had your chance," the Reverend Mother countered.And she was explicit in her instructions: Was the Emperor ever angry with his concubine?His unique powers must make him lonely.To whom could he speak in any hope of being understood?To the sister, obviously.She shared this loneliness.The depth of their communion must be exploited.Opportunities must be created to throw them together in privacy.Intimate encounters must be arranged.The possibility of eliminating the concubine must be explored.Grief dissolved traditional barriers.Irulan protested.If Chani were killed, suspicion would fasten immediately upon the Princess Consort.Besides, there were other problems.Chani had fastened upon an ancient Fremen diet supposed to promote fertility and the diet eliminated all opportunity for administering the contraceptive drugs.Lifting the suppressives would make Chani even more fertile.The Reverend Mother was outraged and concealed it with difficulty while her fingers flashed their demands.Why had this information not been conveyed at the beginning of their conversation?How could Irulan be that stupid?If Chani conceived and bore a son, the Emperor would declare the child his heir!Irulan protested that she understood the dangers, but the genes might not be totally lost.Damn such stupidity!the Reverend Mother raged.Who knew what suppressions and genetic entanglements Chani might introduce from her wild Fremen strain?The Sisterhood must have only the pure line!And an heir would renew Paul's ambitions, spur him to new efforts in consolidating his Empire.The conspiracy could not afford such a setback.Defensively, Irulan wanted to know how she could have prevented Chani from trying this diet?But the Reverend Mother was in no mood for excuses.Irulan received explicit instructions now to meet this new threat.If Chani conceived, an abortifact must be introduced into her food or drink.Either that, or she must be killed.An heir to the throne from that source must be prevented at all costs.An abortifact would be as dangerous as an open attack on the concubine.Irulan objected.She trembled at the thought of trying to kill Chani.Was Irulan deterred by danger?The Reverend Mother wanted to know, her finger talk conveying deep scorn.Angered, Irulan signaled that she knew her value as an agent in the royal household.Did the conspiracy wish to waste such a valuable agent?Was she to be thrown away?In what other way could they keep this close a watch on the Emperor?Or had they introduced another agent into the household?Was that it?Was she to be used now, desperately, and for the last time?In a war, all values acquired new relationships, the Reverend Mother countered.Their greatest peril was that House Atreides should secure itself with an Imperial line.The Sisterhood could not take such a risk.This went far beyond the danger to the Atreides genetic pattern.Let Paul anchor his family to the throne and the Sisterhood could look forward to centuries of disruption for its programs.Irulan understood the argument, but she couldn't escape the thought that a decision had been made to spend the Princess Consort for something of great value.Was there something she should know about the ghola?Irulan ventured.The Reverend Mother wanted to know if Irulan thought the Sisterhood composed of fools.When had they ever failed to tell Irulan all she should know?It was no answer, but an admission of concealment, Irulan saw.It said she would be told no more than she needed to know.How could they be certain the ghola was capable of destroying the Emperor?Irulan asked.She could just as well have asked if melange were capable of destruction, the Reverend Mother countered.It was a rebuke with a subtle message, Irulan realized.The Bene Gesserit "whip that instructs" informed her that she should have understood long ago this similarity between the spice and the ghola.Melange was valuable, but it exacted a price   addiction.It added years to a life   decades for some   but it was still just another way to die.The ghola was something of deadly value.The obvious way to prevent an unwanted birth was to kill the prospective mother before conception, the Reverend Mother signaled, returning to the attack.Of course, Irulan thought.If you decide to spend a certain sum, get as much for it as you can.The Reverend Mother's eyes, dark with the blue brilliance of her melange addiction, stared up at Irulan, measuring, waiting, observing minutiae.She reads me clearly, Irulan thought with dismay.She trained me and observed me in that training.She knows I realize what decision has been taken here.She only observes now to see how I will take this knowledge.Well, I will take it as a Bene Gesserit and a princess.Irulan managed a smile, pulled herself erect, thought of the evocative opening passage of the Litany Against Fear:  "I must not fear.Fear is the mind killer.Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear...  "When calmness had returned, she thought: Let them spend me.I will show them what a princess is worth.Perhaps I'll buy them more than they expected.After a few more empty vocalizations to bind off the interview.Irulan departed.When she had gone, the Reverend Mother returned to her tarot cards, laying them out in the fire eddy pattern.Immediately, she got the Kwisatz Haderach of the Major Arcana and the card lay coupled with the Eight of Ships: the sibyl hoodwinked and betrayed.These were not cards of good omen: they spoke of concealed resources for her enemies.She turned away from the cards, sat in agitation, wondering if Irulan might yet destroy them.= = = = = =   The Fremen see her as the Earth Figure, a demigoddess whose special charge is to protect the tribes through her powers of violence.She is Reverend Mother to their Reverend Mothers.To pilgrims who seek her out with demands that she restore virility or make the barren fruitful, she is a form of antimentat.She feeds on that proof that the "analytic" has limits.She represents ultimate tension.She is the virgin harlot   witty, vulgar, cruel, as destructive in her whims as a coriolis storm.St.Alia of the Knife as taken from The Irulan Report   Alia stood like a black robed sentinel figure on the south platform of her temple, the Fane of the Oracle which Paul's Fremen cohorts had built for her against a wall of his stronghold.She hated this part of her life, but knew no way to evade the temple without bringing down destruction upon them all.The pilgrims (damn them!)grew more numerous every day.The temple's lower porch was crowded with them.Vendors moved among the pilgrims, and there were minor sorcerers, haruspices, diviners, all working their trade in pitiful imitation of Paul Muad'dib and his sister.Red and green packages containing the new Dune Tarot were prominent among the vendors' wares, Alia saw.She wondered about the tarot.Who was feeding this device into the Arrakeen market?Why had the tarot sprung to prominence at this particular time and place?Was it to muddy Time?Spice addiction always conveyed some sensitivity to prediction.Fremen were notoriously fey.Was it an accident that so many of them dabbled in portents and omens here and now?She decided to seek an answer at the first opportunity.There was a wind from the southeast, a small leftover wind blunted by the scarp of the Shield Wall which loomed high in these northern reaches.The rim glowed orange through a thin dust haze underlighted by the late afternoon sun.It was a hot wind against her cheeks and it made her homesick for the sand, for the security of open spaces.The last of the day's mob began descending the broad greenstone steps of the lower porch, singly and in groups, a few pausing to stare at the keepsakes and holy amulets on the street vendors' racks, some consulting one last minor sorcerer.Pilgrims, supplicants, townfolk, Fremen, vendors closing up for the day   they formed a straggling line that trailed off into the palm lined avenue which led to the heart of the city.Alia's eyes picked out the Fremen, marking the frozen looks of superstitious awe on their faces, the half wild way they kept their distance from the others.They were her strength and her peril.They still captured giant worms for transport, for sport and for sacrifice.They resented the offworld pilgrims, barely tolerated the townfolk of graben and pan, hated the cynicism they saw in the street vendors.One did not jostle a wild Fremen, even in a mob such as the ones which swarmed to Alia's Fane.There were no knifings in the Sacred Precincts, but bodies had been found...later.The departing swarm had stirred up dust.The flinty odor came to Alia's nostrils, ignited another pang of longing for the open bled.Her sense of the past, she realized, had been sharpened by the coming of the ghola.There'd been much pleasure in those untrammeled days before her brother had mounted the throne   time for joking, time for small things, time to enjoy a cool morning or a sunset, time...time...time...Even danger had been good in those days   clean danger from known sources.No need then to strain the limits of prescience, to peer through murky veils for frustrating glimpses of the future.Wild Fremen said it well: "Four things cannot be hidden   love, smoke, a pillar of fire and a man striding across the open bled. "With an abrupt feeling of revulsion, Alia retreated from the platform into the shadows of the Fane, strode along the balcony which looked down into the glistening opalescence of her Hall of Oracles.Sand on the tiles rasped beneath her feet.Supplicants always tracked sand into the Sacred Chambers!She ignored attendants, guards, postulants, the Qizarate's omnipresent priest sycophants, plunged into the spiral passage which twisted upward to her private quarters.There, amidst divans, deep rugs, tent hangings and mementos of the desert, she dismissed the Fremen amazons Stilgar had assigned as her personal guardians.Watchdogs, more likely!When they had gone, muttering and objecting, but more fearful of her than they were of Stilgar, she stripped off her robe, leaving only the sheathed crysknife on its thong around her neck, strewed garments behind as she made for the bath.He was near, she knew   that shadow figure of a man she could sense in her future, but could not see.It angered her that no power of prescience could put flesh on that figure.He could be sensed only at unexpected moments while she scanned the lives of others.Or she came upon a smoky outline in solitary darkness when innocence lay coupled with desire.He stood just beyond an unfixed horizon, and she felt that if she strained her talents to an unexpected intensity she might see him.He was there   a constant assault on her awareness: fierce, dangerous, immoral.Moist warm air surrounded her in the tub.Here was a habit she had learned from the memory entities of the uncounted Reverend Mothers who were strung out in her awareness like pearls on a glowing necklace.Water, warm water in a sunken tub, accepted her skin as she slid into it.Green tiles with figures of red fish worked into a sea pattern surrounded the water.Such an abundance of water occupied this space that a Fremen of old would have been outraged to see it used merely for washing human flesh.He was near.It was lust in tension with chastity, she thought.Her flesh desired a mate.Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend Mother who had presided at the sietch orgies.The tau awareness of her other selves could supply any detail her curiosity required.This feeling of nearness could be nothing other than flesh reaching for flesh.Need for action fought lethargy in the warm water.Abruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet and naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom.The chamber, oblong and skylighted, contained the gross and subtle instruments which toned a Bene Gesserit adept into ultimate physical and mental awareness / preparedness.There were mnemonic amplifiers, digit mills from lx to strengthen and sensitize fingers and toes, odor synthesizers, tactility sensitizers, temperature gradient fields, pattern betrayers to prevent her falling into detectable habits, alpha wave response trainers, blink synchronizers to tone abilities in light / dark / spectrum analysis...In ten centimeter letters along one wall, written by her own hand in mnemonic paint, stood the key reminder from the Bene Gesserit Creed:  "Before us, all methods of learning were tainted by instinct.We learned how to learn.Before us, instinct ridden researchers possessed a limited attention span   often no longer than a single lifetime.Projects stretching across fifty or more lifetimes never occurred to them.The concept of total muscle / nerve training had not entered awareness. "As she moved into the training room, Alia caught her own reflection multiplied thousands of times in the crystal prisms of a fencing mirror swinging in the heart of a target dummy.She saw the long sword waiting on its brackets against the target, and she thought: Yes!I'll work myself to exhaustion   drain the flesh and clear the mind.The sword felt right in her hand.She slipped the crysknife from its sheath at her neck, held it sinister, tapped the activating stud with the sword tip.Resistance came alive as the aura of the target shield built up, pushing her weapon slowly and firmly away.Prisms glittered.The target slipped to her left.Alia followed with the tip of the long blade, thinking as she often did that the thing could almost be alive.But it was only servomotors and complex reflector circuits designed to lure the eyes away from danger, to confuse and teach.It was an instrument geared to react as she reacted, an anti self which moved as she moved, balancing light on its prisms, shifting its target, offering its counter blade.Many blades appeared to lunge at her from the prisms, but only one was real.She countered the real one, slipped the sword past shield resistance to tap the target.A marker light came alive: red and glistening among the prisms...more distraction.Again the thing attacked, moving at one marker speed now, just a bit faster than it had at the beginning.She parried and, against all caution, moved into the danger zone, scored with the crysknife.Two lights glowed from the prisms.Again, the thing increased speed, moving out on its rollers, drawn like a magnet to the motions of her body and the tip of her sword.Attack   parry   counter.Attack   parry   counter...She had four lights alive in there now, and the thing was becoming more dangerous, moving faster with each light, offering more areas of confusion.Five lights.Sweat glistened on her naked skin.She existed now in a universe whose dimensions were outlined by the threatening blade, the target, bare feet against the practice floor, senses / nerves / muscles   motion against motion.Attack   parry   counter.Six lights.
