There was no way to know what would be on the other side of the inner airlock door when it finally opened.Holden put his hand on the butt of his pistol with a nonchalance he didnt feel.The inner door slid open.The sudden screech of his hazmat suits radiation alarm nearly gave him a heart attack.He chinned the control that killed the audible alarm, though he kept the outside radiation level meter running.It wasnt data that actually did him any good, but the suit was reassuring him that it could handle the current levels, and that was nice.Holden stepped out of the airlock into a small compartment filled with storage lockers and EVA equipment.It looked empty, but a small noise from one of the lockers alerted him, and he turned just in time to see a man in a UN naval uniform burst out of the locker and swing a heavy wrench at his head.The bulky hazmat suit kept him from moving quickly, and the wrench struck a ringing blow off the side of his helmet.Jim!Naomi yelled over the radio.Die, you bastard!the Navy man yelled at the same time.He took a second swing, but he wasnt wearing mag boots, and without the push off the bulkhead to give him momentum, the swing did little more than start spinning the man around in the air.Holden grabbed the wrench out of his hand and threw it away.He caught the man to stop his spinning with his left hand and drew his pistol with his right.If you cracked my suit, Im going to throw you out that airlock, Holden said.He began flipping through suit status screens while keeping his pistol pointed at the wrench enthusiast.It looks okay, Naomi said, relief evident in her voice.No reds or yellows.That helmet is tougher than it looks.What the hell were you doing in that locker?Holden asked the man.I was working here when the it came on board, the man said.He was a compact looking Earther, with pale skin and flaming red hair cut close to the scalp.A patch on his suit said LARSON.All the doors sealed up during emergency lockdown.I was trapped in here, but I could watch what was happening on the internal security system.I was hoping to grab a suit and get out the airlock, but it was sealed too.Say, howd you get in here?I have admiralty level overrides, Holden said to him.Quietly, to Naomi he said, At current radiation levels, whats survival odds for our friend here?Not bad, Naomi said.If we get him into sick bay in the next couple of hours.To Larson he said, Okay, youre coming with me.Were going to CIC.Get me there fast, and youve got a ride off this tub.Yes, sir!Larson said with a salute.He thinks youre an admiral.Naomi laughed.Larson, put on an environment suit.Do it fast.Sir, yes sir!The suits they had in the airlock storage lockers would at least have their own air supplies.That would cut down on damage from the radiation the young sailor was absorbing.And an airtight suit would reduce the risk of protomolecule infection as they made their way through the ship.Holden waited until Larson had shrugged into a suit, then transmitted the override code to the hatch and it slid open.After you, Larson.Command information center, as fast as you can.If we run into anyone, especially if theyre throwing up, stay away and let me deal with them.Yes, sir, Larson said, his voice fuzzy over the static filled radio, then pushed off into the corridor.He took Holden at his word and led him on a fast trip through the crippled Agatha King.They stopped only when a sealed hatch blocked their way, and then only long enough for Holdens suit to convince it to open.The areas of the ship they moved through didnt look damaged at all.The bioweapon pod had hit farther aft, and the monster had headed straight to the reactor room.According to Larson, it had killed a number of people on the way, including the ships entire contingent of Marines when they tried to stop it.But once it had entered engineering, it mostly ignored the rest of the crew.Larson said that shortly after it got into engineering, the shipwide security camera system had gone off line.With no way to know where the monster was, and no way out of the airlock storage room, Larson had hidden in a locker to wait it out.When you came in, all I could see was this big, lumpy red thing, Larson explained.I thought maybe you were another one of those monsters.The lack of visible damage was a good thing.It meant all the hatches and other systems they came across still worked.The lack of a monster rampaging through the ship was even better.The thing that had Holden worried was the lack of people.A ship this size had over a thousand crew persons.At least some of them should be in the areas of the ship they were passing through, but so far they hadnt run across a single one.The occasional puddle of brown goo on the floor was not an encouraging sign.Larson stopped at a locked hatch to let Holden catch his breath.The heavy hazmat suit was not built for long treks, and it was starting to fill up with the stink of his own sweat.While he took a minute to rest and let the suits cooling systems try to bring his temperature down, Larson said, Well be going past the forward galley to one of the elevator bays.The CIC is on the deck just above.Five, ten minutes tops.Holden checked his air supply and saw that he had burned nearly half of it.He was rapidly approaching the point of no return.But something in Larsons voice caught his ear.It was the way he said galley.Is there something I should know about the galley?Larson said, Im not sure.But after the cameras went out, I kept hoping someone was going to come get me.So I started trying to call people on the comm.When that didnt work, I started having the King do location checks on people I knew.After a while, no matter who I asked about, the answer was always the forward galley.So, Holden said.There might be upwards of a thousand infected Navy people crammed into that galley?Larson gave a shrug barely visible in his environment suit.Maybe the monster killed them and put them there.Oh, I think thats exactly what happened, Holden said, taking out his gun and working the slide to chamber a round.But I seriously doubt they stayed dead.Before Larson could ask what he meant, Holden had his suit unlock the hatch.When I open this door, you head to the elevator as fast as you can.Ill be right behind you.Dont stop no matter what.You have to get me to that CIC.Are we clear?Larson nodded inside his helmet.Good.On three.Holden began counting, one hand on the hatch, the other holding his gun.When he hit three, he shoved the hatch open.Larson put his feet against a bulkhead and pushed off down the corridor on the other side.Tiny blue flickers floated in the air around them like fireflies.Like the lights Miller had reported when he was on Eros the second time.The time he didnt come back from.The fireflies were here now too.At the end of the corridor, Holden could see the elevator door.He began clumping after Larson on his magnetic boots.When Larson was halfway down the corridor, he passed an open hatch.The young sailor started screaming.Holden ran as fast as the clumsy hazmat suit and his magnetic boots would let him go.Larson kept flying down the corridor, but he was screaming and flailing at the air like a drowning man trying to swim.Holden was almost to the open hatch when something crawled out of it and into his path.At first he thought it was the kind of vomit zombie hed run into on Eros.It moved slowly, and the front of its Navy uniform was covered in brown vomit.But when it turned to look at Holden, its eyes glowed with a faint inner blue.And there was an intelligence in them the Eros zombies hadnt had.The protomolecule had learned some lessons on Eros.This was the new, improved version of the vomit zombie.Holden didnt wait to see what it was going to do.Without slowing his pace, he raised his pistol and shot it in the head.To his relief, the light went out of its eyes, and it spun away from the deck, spraying brown goo in an arc as it rotated.When he passed the open hatch, he risked a glance inside.It was full of the new vomit zombies.Hundreds of them.All their disconcertingly blue eyes were aimed at him.Holden turned back to the corridor and ran.From behind, he heard a rising wave of sounds as the zombies moaned as one and began climbing along the bulkheads and deck after him.Go!Get in the elevator!he screamed at Larson, cursing at how much the heavy hazmat suit slowed him down.God, what was that?Naomi said.Hed forgotten she was watching.He didnt waste breath answering.Larson had come out of his panic induced fugue and was busily working the elevator doors open.Holden ran up to him and then turned around to look behind.Dozens of the blue eyed vomit zombies filled the corridor behind him, crawling on the bulkheads, ceiling, and deck like spiders.The floating blue lights swirled on air currents Holden couldnt feel.Go faster, he said to Larson, sighting down his pistol at the lead zombie and putting a bullet in its head.It floated off the wall, spraying goo as it went.The zombie behind it shoved it out of the way, which sent it spinning down the corridor toward them.Holden moved in front of Larson to protect him, and a spray of brown slime hit his chest and visor.If they hadnt both been wearing sealed suits, it would have been a death sentence.He repressed a shudder and shot two more zombies.The rest didnt even slow down.Behind him, Larson cursed as the partially opened doors snapped shut again, pinning his arm.The sailor worked them back open, pushing them with his back and one leg.Were in!Larson yelled.Holden began backing up toward the elevator shaft, emptying the rest of his magazine as he went.Half a dozen more zombies spun away, spraying goo; then he was in the shaft and Larson shoved the doors shut.Up one level, Larson said, panting with fear and exertion.He pushed off the bulkhead and floated up to the next set of doors, then levered them open.Holden followed, replacing the magazine in his gun.Directly across from the elevator was a heavily armored hatch with cic stenciled in white on the metal.Holden moved toward it, having his suit transmit the override code.Behind him, Larson let the elevator doors slam shut.The howling of the zombies echoed up the elevator shaft.We should hurry, Holden said, hitting the button to open the CIC and bulling his way in before the hatch had finished cycling open.Larson floated through after him.There was a single man still in the CIC: a squat, powerfully built Asian man with an admirals uniform and a large caliber pistol in one shaky hand.Stay where you are, the man said.Admiral Nguyen!Larson blurted out.Youre alive!Nguyen ignored him.Youre here for the bioweapon launch vehicle remote codes.I have them here.He held up a hand terminal.Theyre yours in exchange for a ride off of this ship.Hes taking us, Larson said, pointing at Holden.He said hed take me too.No fucking way, Holden said to Nguyen.Not a chance.Either give me those codes because theres a scrap of humanity left in you, or give them to me because youre dead.I dont give a shit either way.You decide.Nguyen looked back and forth from Larson to Holden, clutching the hand terminal and the pistol so tightly that his knuckles were white.No!You have to   Holden shot him in the throat.Somewhere in his brain stem, Detective Miller nodded in approval.Start working on an alternate route back to my ship, Holden said to Larson as he walked across the room to grab the hand terminal floating by Nguyens corpse.It took him a moment to find the Kings self destruct switch hidden behind a locked panel.Southers override code gave him access to that too.Sorry, Holden said quietly to Naomi as he opened it.I know I sort of agreed not to do that anymore.But I didnt have time to   No, Naomi said, her voice sad.That bastard deserved to die.And I know youll feel like shit about it later.Thats good enough for me.The panel opened, and a simple button lay on the other side.It wasnt even red, just a plain industrial white.This is what blows the ship?No timer, Naomi said.Well, this is an anti boarding fail safe.If someone opens this panel and presses this button, its because the ship is lost.They dont want it on a timer someone can just disarm.This is an engineering problem, Naomi said.She already knew what he was thinking, and she was trying to get an answer out before he could say it.We can solve this.We cant, Holden said, waiting to feel the sorrow but instead feeling a sort of quiet peace.There are a couple hundred very angry zombies trying to get up the elevator shaft right now.We wont come up with a solution that doesnt leave me stranded in here anyway.A hand squeezed his shoulder.He looked up, and Larson said, Ill press it.No, you dont have to   Larson held out his arm.The sleeve of his environment suit had a tiny tear where the elevator doors had closed on it.Around the tear was a palm sized brown stain.Just rotten fucking luck, I guess.But I watched the Eros feeds like everyone else, Larson said.You cant risk taking me.Pretty soon I might be He paused and pointed back toward the elevator with his head.Might be one of those.Holden took Larsons hand in his.The thick gloves made it impossible to feel anything.Im very sorry.Hey, you tried, Larson said with a sad smile.At least now I wont die of thirst in a suit locker.Admiral Souther will know about this, Holden said.Ill make sure everyone knows.Seriously, Larson said, floating next to the button that would turn the Agatha King into a small star for a few seconds.He pulled off his helmet and took a long breath.Theres another airlock three decks up.If they arent in the elevator shaft yet, you can make it.Larson, I   You should go away now.Holden had to strip off his suit in the Kings airlock.It was covered in the goo, and he couldnt risk taking it onto the Razorback.He absorbed a few rads while he stole another UN vac suit from one of the lockers and put it on instead.It looked exactly like the one Larson was wearing.As soon as he was back on the Razorback, he sent the remote command codes to Southers ship.He was nearly back to the Rocinante when the King vanished in a ball of white fire.Fifty: Bobbie  The captain just left, Amos said to Bobbie when he came back into the machine shop.She floated half a meter above the deck inside a small circle of deadly technology.Behind her sat her cleaned and refitted recon suit, a single barrel of the newly installed gun gleaming inside the port on its right arm.To her left floated the recently reassembled auto shotgun Amos favored.The rest of the circle was formed by pistols, grenades, a combat knife, and a variety of weapon magazines.Bobbie took one last mental inventory and decided shed done all she could do.He thinks maybe hes not coming back from this one, Amos continued, then bent down to grab the auto shotgun.He looked it over with a critical eye, then gave her an appreciative nod.Going into a fight where you know you arent coming back gives you a sort of clarity, Bobbie said.She reached out and grabbed her armor, pulling herself into it.Not an easy thing to do in microgravity.She had to twist and shimmy to get her legs down into the suit before she could start sealing up the chest.She noticed Amos watching her.He had a dopey grin on his face.Seriously.Now?she said.Were talking about your captain going off to his death, and all thats going through your head right now is Ooh, boobies!Amos continued to grin, not chastened at all.That bodysuit dont leave a lot to the imagination.Thats all.Bobbie rolled her eyes.Believe me, if I could wear a bulky sweater inside my fully articulated, power assisted combat suit, I still wouldnt.Because that would be stupid.She hit the controls to seal the suit, and her armor folded around her like a second skin.She closed the helmet, using the suits external speakers to talk to Amos, knowing it would make her voice robotic and inhuman.Better put your big boy pants on, she said, the sound echoing around the room.Amos took an unconscious step back.The captain isnt the only one that might not be coming back.Bobbie climbed onto the ladder lift and let it take her all the way up to the ops deck.Avasarala was belted into her couch at the comm station.Naomi was in Holdens usual spot at the tactical panel.Alex would be up in the cockpit already.Bobbie opened her visor to speak using her normal voice.We cleared?she asked Avasarala.The old lady nodded and held up one hand in a wait gesture while she spoke to someone on her headset mic.The Martians have already dropped a full platoon, she said, pushing the mic away from her face.But their orders are to set up a perimeter and seal the base while someone further up the food chain decides what to do.Theyre not going to  Bobbie started, but Avasarala cut her off with a dismissive wave of her hand.Fuck no, she said.Im further up the food chain, and Ive already decided were going to glass this abattoir as soon as youre off the surface.Im letting them think were still discussing it so you have time to go get the kids.Bobbie nodded her fist at Avasarala.Recon Marines were trained to use the Belters physical idiom when in their combat armor.Avasarala just looked baffled at the gesture and said, So stop playing with your hand and go get the fucking kids.Bobbie headed back to the ladder lift, connecting to the ships 1MC as she went.Amos, Prax, meet me in the airlock in five minutes, geared up and ready to go.Alex, put us on the deck in ten.Roger that, Alex replied.Good hunting, soldier.She wondered if they might have become friends, given enough time.It was a pleasant thought.Amos was waiting for her outside the airlock when she arrived.He wore his Martian made light armor and carried his oversized gun.Prax rushed into the compartment a few minutes later, still struggling to get into his borrowed gear.He looked like a boy wearing his fathers shoes.While Amos helped him get buttoned up, Alex called down to the airlock and said, Heading down.Hang on to something.Bobbie turned her boot mags to full, locking herself to the deck while the ship shifted under her.Amos and Prax both sat down on chairs that pulled out from the wall, and belted in.Lets go over the plan one more time, she said, calling up the aerial photos theyd shot of the facility.She patched into the Roci and threw the pictures onto a wall monitor.This airlock is our entrance.If its locked, Amos will blast it with explosives to open the outer door.We need to get inside fast.Your armor isnt going to protect you from the vicious radiation belt Io orbits in for long.Prax, you have the radio link Naomi rigged, so once were inside, you start looking for a network node to plug it into.We have no information about the layout of the base, so the faster we can get Naomi hacking their system, the faster we can find those kids.I like the backup plan better, Amos said.Backup plan?Prax asked.The backup plan is I grab the first guy we see, and beat him until he tells us where the kids are.Prax nodded.Okay.I like that one too.Bobbie ignored the macho posturing.Everyone dealt with pre combat jitters in their own way.Bobbie preferred obsessive list making.But flexing and threats were good too.Once we have a location, you guys move with all haste to the kids, while I ensure a clear path of egress.Sounds good, Amos said.Make no mistake, Bobbie said.Io is one of the worst places in the solar system.Tectonically unstable and radioactive as hell.Easy to see why they hid here, but do not underestimate the peril that just being on this shit moon carries.Two minutes, Alex said over the comm.Bobbie took a deep breath.And that isnt the worst.These assholes launched a couple hundred human protomolecule hybrids at Mars.We can hope that they shot their entire wad, but I have a feeling they didnt.We might very well run into one of those monsters once we get inside.She didnt say, Ive seen it in my dreams.It seemed counterproductive.If we see one, I deal with it.Amos, you almost got your captain killed blasting away at the one you found in the cargo bay.You try that shit with me, Ill snap your arm off.Dont test me.Okay, chief, Amos replied.Dont get your panties in a twist.I heard you.One minute, Alex said.There are Martian Marines controlling the perimeter, but theyve been given the okay to let us in.If someone escapes past us, no need to apprehend them.The Marines will pick them up before they get far.Thirty seconds.Get ready, Bobbie said, then pulled up her HUDs suit status display.Everything was green, including the ammo indicator, which showed two thousand incendiary rounds.The air sucked out of the airlock in a long, fading hiss, leaving only a thin wisp of atmosphere that would be the same density as Ios own faint haze of sulfur.Before the ship hit the deck, Amos jumped up out of his chair and stood on his toes to put his helmet against hers.He yelled, Give em hell, marine.The outer airlock door slid open, and Bobbies suit blatted a radiation alarm at her.It also helpfully informed her that the outside atmosphere was not capable of supporting life.She shoved Amos toward the open lock and then pushed Prax after him.Go, go, go!Amos took off across the ground in a weird, hopping run, his breath panting in her ears over the radio link.Prax stayed close behind him and seemed more comfortable in the low gravity.He had no trouble keeping up.Bobbie climbed out of the Roci and then jumped in a long arc that took her about seven meters above the surface at its apex.She visually scanned the area while her suit reached out with radar and EM sensors, trying to pinpoint targets.Neither she nor it found any.She hit the ground next to the lumbering Amos and hopped again, beating them both to the airlock door.She tapped the button and the outer door cycled open.Of course.Who locks their door on Io?No one is going to hike across a wasteland of molten silicon and sulfur to steal the family silver.Amos plowed past her into the airlock, stopping for breath only once he was inside.Bobbie followed Prax in a second later, and she was about to tell Amos to cycle the airlock when her radio died.She spun around, looking out across the surface of the moon for movement.Amos came up behind her and put his helmet against her back armor.When he yelled, it was barely audible.What is it?Instead of yelling back, she stepped outside the airlock and pointed to Amos, then pointed at the inner door.She mimed a person walking with her fingers.Amos nodded at her with one hand, then moved back into the airlock and shut the outer door.Whatever happened inside, it was up to Amos and Prax now.She wished them well.She spotted the movement before her suit did.Something shifting against the sulfurous yellow background.Something not quite the same color.She tracked it with her eyes and had the suit hit it with a targeting laser.She wouldnt lose track of it now.It might gobble radio waves, but the fact that she could see it meant that light bounced off it just fine.It moved again.Not quickly, and staying close to the ground.If she hadnt been looking right at it, shed have missed the motion entirely.Being sneaky.Which probably meant it didnt know shed spotted it.Her suits laser range finder marked it as just over three hundred meters away.According to her theory, once it realized it had been spotted, it would charge her, moving in a straight line to try to grab and rip.If it couldnt reach her quickly, it would try to throw things at her.And all she needed to do was hurt it until its program failed and it self destructed.Lots of theories.Time to test them out.She aimed her gun at it.The suit helped her correct for deflection based on the range, but she was using ultrahigh velocity rounds on a moon with fractional gravity.Bullet drop at three hundred meters would be trivial.Even though there was no way the creature could see it through her helmets darkened visor, she blew it a kiss.Im back, sweetie.Come say hi to momma.She tapped the trigger on her gun.Fifty rounds streaked downrange, crossing the distance from her gun to the creature in less than a third of a second.All fifty slammed into it, shedding very little of their kinetic energy as they passed through.Just enough to burst the tip of each round open and ignite the self oxidizing flammable gel they carried.Fifty trails of short lived but very intense flame burned through the monster.Some of the black filament bursting from the exit wounds actually caught fire, disappearing with a flash.The monster launched itself toward Bobbie at a dead run that should have been impossible in low gravity.Each push of its limbs should have launched it high into the air.It stuck to the silicate surface of Io as though it were wearing magnetic boots on a metal deck.Its speed was breathtaking.Its blue eyes blazed like lightning.The long, improbable hands reached out for her, clenching and grasping at nothing as it ran.It was all just like in her dreams.And for a split second, Bobbie just wanted to stand perfectly still and let the scene play out to the conclusion shed never gotten to see.Another part of her mind expected her to wake up, soaking with sweat, as she had so many times before.Bobbie watched as it ran toward her, and noted with pleasure the burnt black injuries the incendiary bullets had cut through its body.No sprays of black filament and then the wounds closing like water.Not this time.Shed hurt it, and she wanted to go on hurting it.She turned away and took off in a bounding run at a ninety degree angle to its path.Her suit kept the targeting laser locked on to the monster, so she could track its location even without turning around to look.As shed suspected, it turned to follow her, but it lost ground.Fast on the straightaways, Bobbie said to it.But you corner like shit.When the creature realized she wasnt going to just stand still and let it get close to her, it stopped.Bobbie stumbled to a stop, turning to watch it.It reached down and tore up a big chunk of ancient lava bed, then reached down to grip the ground with its other hand.Here it comes, Bobbie said to herself.She threw herself to the side as the creatures arm whipped forward.The rock missed her by centimeters as she hurtled sideways.She hit the moons surface and skidded, already returning fire.This time she fired for several seconds, sending hundreds of rounds into and through the creature.Anything you can do I can do better, she sang under her breath.I can do anything better than you.The bullets tore great flaming chunks out of the monster and nearly severed its left arm.The creature spun around and collapsed.Bobbie bounced back to her feet, ready to run again if the monster got back up.It didnt.Instead, it rolled over onto its back and shook.Its head began to swell, and the blue eyes flashed even brighter.Bobbie could see things moving beneath the surface of its chitinous black skin.Boom, motherfucker!she yelled at it, waiting for the bomb to go off.Instead, it bounced suddenly to its feet, tore a portion of its own abdomen off, and threw it at her.By the time Bobbie realized what had just happened, the bomb was only a few meters from her.It detonated and blew her off her feet.She went skidding across Ios surface, her armor blaring warnings at her.When she finally came to a stop, her HUD was flashing a Christmas display of red and green lights.She tried to move her limbs, but they were as heavy as stone.The suits motion control processor, the computer that interpreted her bodys movements and turned them into commands for the suits actuators, had failed.The suit was trying to reboot it while simultaneously trying to reroute and run the program in a different location.A flashing amber message on the HUD said PLEASE STAND BY.Bobbie couldnt turn her head yet, so when the monster leaned down over her, it took her completely by surprise.She stifled a scream.It wouldnt have mattered.The sulfur atmosphere on Io was far too thin for sound waves to travel in.The monster couldnt have heard her.But while the new Bobbie was at peace with the idea of dying in battle, enough of the old Bobbie remained that she was not going to go out screaming like a baby.It leaned down to look at her; its overlarge and curiously childlike eyes glowed bright blue.The damage her gun had done seemed extensive, but the creature appeared not to notice.It poked at her chest armor with one long finger, then convulsed and vomited a thick spray of brown goo all over her.Oh, thats disgusting, she yelled at it.If her suit had been opened up to the outside, getting that protomolecule shit on her would have been the least of her problems.But still, how the hell was she going to wash this crap off?It cocked its head and regarded her curiously.It poked again at her armor, one finger wriggling into gaps, trying to find a way in to her skin.Shed seen one of these things rip a nine ton combat mech apart.If it wanted into her suit, it was coming in.But it seemed reluctant to damage her for some reason.As she watched, a long, flexible tube burst out of its midsection and began probing at her armor instead of the finger.Brown goo dribbled out of this new appendage in a constant stream.Her gun status light flickered from red to green.She spun up the barrels to test it and it worked.Of course, her suit was still telling her to please stand by when it came to actually moving.Maybe if the monster got bored and wandered in front of her gun, she could get some shots off.The tube was probing at her armor more insistently now.It pushed its way into gaps, periodically shooting brown liquid into them.It was as repulsive as it was frightening.It was like being threatened by a serial killer that was also fumbling at her clothing with a teenagers horny insistence.Oh, to hell with this, she said to it.She was about through with letting this thing grope her while she lay helpless on her back.The suits right arm was heavy, and the actuators that made her strong when it was working also resisted movement when it was not.Pushing her arm up was like doing a one arm bench press while wearing a lead glove.She pressed up anyway until she felt something pop.It might have been in the suit.It might have been in her arm.She couldnt tell yet, because she was too wired for pain to set in.But when it popped, her arm came up, and she pushed her fist up against the monsters head.Buh bye, she said.The monster turned to look curiously at her hand.She held down the trigger until the ammo counter read zero and the gun stopped spinning.The creature had ceased to exist from the shoulders up.She dropped her arm back to the ground, exhausted.REROUTE SUCCESSFUL, her suit told her.REBOOTING, it said.When the subliminal hum came back, she started laughing and found she couldnt stop.She shoved the monsters corpse off her and sat up.Good thing.Its a really long walk back to the ship.Fifty One: Prax  Prax ran.Around him, the station walls formed angles at the center to make an elongated hexagon.The gravity was barely higher than Ganymede standard, and after weeks at a full g burn, Prax had to pay attention to keep himself from rising to the ceiling with each step.Amos loped beside him, every stride low, long, and fast.The shotgun in the mans hands remained perfectly level.At a T intersection ahead, a woman appeared.Dark hair and skin.Not the one whod taken Mei.Her eyes went wide and she darted off.They know were coming, Prax said.He was panting a little.That probably wasnt their first clue, Doc, Amos said.His voice was perfectly conversational, but there was an intensity in it.Something like anger.At the intersection, they paused, Prax leaning over and resting elbows on knees to catch his breath.It was an old, primitive reflex.In less than.2 g, the blood return wasnt significantly increased by putting his head even with his heart.Strictly speaking, he would have been better off standing and keeping his posture from narrowing any of his blood vessels.He forced himself to stand.Where should I plug in this radio link for Naomi?he asked Amos.Amos shrugged and pointed at the wall.Maybe we can just follow the signs instead.There was a legend on the wall with colored arrows pointing in different directions, ENV CONTROL and CAFETERIA and PRIMARY LAB.Amos tapped PRIMARY LAB with the barrel of his shotgun.Sounds good to me, Prax said.You good to go?I am, Prax said, though he probably wasnt.The floor seemed to shift under him, followed immediately by a long, ominous rumbling that he could feel in the soles of his feet.Naomi?You there?I am.I have to keep track of the captain on the other line.I might pop in and out.Everything all right?Might be stretching the point, Amos said.We got something sounded like someone shooting at us.They aint shooting at the base, are they?They arent, Naomi said from the ship, her voice pressed thin and tinny by the attenuated signal.It looks like some of the locals are mounting a defense, but so far our Marines arent returning fire.Tell em to calm that shit down, Amos said, but he was already moving down the corridor toward the primary lab.Prax jumped after him, misjudged, and cracked his arm against the ceiling.Soon as they ask me, Naomi said.The corridors were a maze, but it was the kind of maze Prax had been running through his whole life.The institutional logic of a research facility was the same everywhere.The floor plans were different; budget concerns could change how richly appointed the details were; the fields being supported determined what equipment was present.But the soul of the place was the same, and it was Praxs home.Twice more, they caught sight of people scattering through the halls with them.The first was a young Belter woman in a white lab coat.The second was a massively obese dark skinned man with the squat build of Earth.He was wearing a crisp suit, the signature of the administrative class everywhere.Neither one tried to stop them, so Prax forgot about them almost as soon as he saw them.The imaging suite was behind a set of negative pressure seals.When Prax and Amos went through, the gust of air seemed to push them faster, urging them on.The rumble came again, louder this time and lasting almost fifteen seconds.It could be fighting.It could be a volcano forming nearby.No way to know.Prax knew this base would have to have been built with tectonic instability in mind.He wondered what the safeguards were for a moment, then put it out of his mind.Nothing he could do about it anyway.The labs imaging suite was at least the equal of the one hed shared on Ganymede, with everything from the spidery full resonance displays to the inferential gravity lens.In the corner, a squat orange table showed a holographic image of a colony of rapidly dividing cells.Two doors led out apart from the one theyd come through.Somewhere nearby, people were shouting at each other.Prax pointed at one of the doors.This one, he said.Look at the hinges.Its built to allow a gurney through.The passageway on the other side was warmer and the air was more humid.It wasnt quite greenhouse level, but near to it.It opened into a long gallery with five meter ceilings.Fitted tracks on the ceiling and floor allowed for moving high mass equipment and containment cages.Bays lined it, each, it seemed, with a research bench not so different from the ones Prax had used as an undergraduate: smart table, wall display, inventory control box, specimen cages.The shouting voices were louder now.He was about to say as much, but Amos shook his head and pointed down the gallery toward one of the farther bays.A mans voice came from that direction, his tone high and tight and angry.not an evacuation if theres no place to evacuate to, he was saying.Im not giving up the one bargaining chip I have left.You dont have that option, a woman said.Put the gun down, and lets talk this through.Ive been handling you for seven years, and I will keep you in business for seven more, but you do not   Are you delusional?You think theres a tomorrow after this?Amos pointed forward with his shotgun, then began a slow, deliberate advance.Prax followed, trying to be silent.It had been months since hed heard Dr.Stricklands voice, but the shouting man could be him.It was possible.Let me make this perfectly clear, the man said.We have nothing.Nothing.The only hope of negotiation is if we have a card to play.That means them.Why do you think theyre alive?Carlos, the woman said as Prax came to the corner of the bay.We can have this conversation later.Theres a hostile enemy force on the base right now, and if youre still here when they come through that hatch   Yeah, Amos interrupted, what happens then?The bay was just like the others.Strickland it was unmistakably Strickland stood beside a gray metal transport crate that went from the floor to just above his hip.In the specimen cages, a half dozen children lay motionless, sleeping or drugged.Strickland also had a small gun in his hand, pointed at the woman from the video.She was in a harshly cut uniform, the sort of thing that security forces adopted to make their staff look hard and intimidating.It worked for her.We came in the other hatch, Prax said, pointing back over his shoulder.Da?One syllable, spoken softly.It rang out from the transport cart louder than all the weeks of explosions and gauss rounds and screams of the wounded and dying.Prax couldnt breathe; he couldnt move.He wanted to tell them all to put the guns away, to be careful.There was a child.His child.Stricklands pistol barked, and some sort of high explosive round destroyed the womans neck and face in a spray of blood and cartilage.She tried to scream once, but with significant portions of her larynx already compromised, what she managed was more of a powerful, wet exhalation.Amos lifted the shotgun, but Strickland Merrian, whatever his name was put his pistol on the top of the crate and seemed almost to sag with relief.The woman drifted to the floor, blood and flesh fanning out and falling gently to the ground like a blanket of red lace.Thank God you came, the doctor said.Oh, thank God you came.I was stalling her as long as I could.Dr.Meng, I cant imagine how hard this has been for you.I am so, so sorry.Prax stepped forward.The woman took another jerking breath, her nervous system firing at random now.Strickland smiled at him, the same reassuring smile he recognized from any number of doctors visits over the previous years.Prax found the transports control pad and knelt to open it.The side panel clicked as the magnetic locks gave up their grip.The panel rolled up, disappearing into the carts frame.For a terrible, breathless moment, it was the wrong girl.She had the black, lustrous hair, the egg brown skin.She could have been Meis older sister.And then the child moved.It wasnt much more than shifting her head, but it was all that his brain needed to see his baby in this older girls body.All the months on Ganymede, all the weeks to Tycho and back, shed been growing up without him.Shes so big, he said.Shes grown so much.Mei frowned, tiny ridges popping into being just above her brow.It made her look like Nicola.And then her eyes opened.They were blank and empty.Prax yanked at the release on his helmet and lifted it off.The station air smelled vaguely of sulfur and copper.Meis gaze fastened on him and she smiled.Da, she said again, and put out one hand.When he reached for her, she took his finger in her fist and pulled herself into his arms.He held her to his chest; the warmth and mass of her small body no longer tiny, only small was overwhelming.The void between the stars was smaller than Mei was at that moment.Shes sedated, Strickland said.But her health is perfect.Her immune system has been performing at peak.My baby, Prax said.My perfect girl.Meis eyes were closed, but she smiled and made a small, animal grunt of satisfaction.I cant tell you how sorry I am for all this, Strickland said.If I had any way of reaching you, of telling you what was happening, I swear to you I would have.This has been beyond a nightmare.So youre saying they kept you prisoner here?Amos asked.Almost all the technical staff was here against their will, Strickland said.When we signed on, we were promised resources and freedom of a kind most of us had only dreamed about.When I started, I thought I could make a real difference.I was terribly, terribly wrong, and I will never be able to apologize enough.Praxs blood was singing.A warmth spread from the center of his body, radiating out to his hands and feet.It was like being dosed with the most perfect euphoric in the history of pharmacy.Her hair smelled like the cheap lab shampoo hed used to wash dogs in the laboratories of his youth.He stood too quickly, and her mass and momentum pulled him a few centimeters off the floor.His knees and feet were slick, and it took him a moment to realize hed been kneeling in blood.What happened to these kids?Are there others somewhere else?Amos asked.These are the only ones I was able to save.Theyve all been sedated for evacuation, Strickland said.But right now, we need to leave.Get off the station.I have to get to the authorities.And why do you need to do that?Amos asked.I have to tell them whats been going on here, Strickland said.I have to tell everyone about the crimes that were committed here.Yeah, okay, Amos said.Hey, Prax?You think you could get that?He pointed his shotgun at something on a nearby crate.Prax turned to look at Amos.It was almost a struggle to remember where he was and what they were doing.Oh, he said.Sure.Holding Mei against him with one arm, he took Stricklands gun and trained it on the man.No, Strickland said.You dont you dont understand.Im the victim here.I had to do all this.They forced me.She forced me.You know, Amos said, maybe Im coming across as what a guy like you might call working class.Doesnt mean Im stupid.Youre one of Protogens pet sociopaths, and I aint buying any damn thing youre trying to sell.Stricklands face turned to cold rage like a mask had fallen away.Protogens dead, he said.There is no Protogen.Yeah, Amos said.I got the brand name wrong.Thats the problem here.Mei murmured something, her hand reaching up behind Praxs ear to grip his hair.Strickland stepped back, his hands in fists.I saved her, he said.That girls alive because of me.She was slated for the second generation units, and I pulled her off the project.I pulled all of them.If it wasnt for me, every child here would be worse than dead right now.Worse than dead.It was the broadcast, wasnt it?Prax said.You saw that we might find out, so you wanted to make sure that you had the girl from the screen.The one everyone was looking for.Youd rather I hadnt?Strickland said.It was still me that saved her.Actually, I think that makes it Captain Holden, Prax said.But I take your point.Stricklands pistol had a simple thumb switch on the back.He pressed it to turn the safety on.My home is gone, Prax said, speaking slowly.My job is gone.Most of the people Ive ever known are either dead or scattered through the system.A major government is saying I abuse women and children.Ive had more than eighty explicit death threats from absolute strangers in the last month.And you know what?I dont care.Strickland licked his lips, his eyes shifting from Prax to Amos and back again.I dont need to kill you, Prax said.I have my daughter back.Revenge isnt important to me.Strickland took a deep breath and let it out slowly.Prax could see the mans body relax, and something on the dividing line of relief and pleasure appeared at the corners of his mouth.Mei twitched once when Amos auto shotgun fired, but she lay back down against Praxs shoulder without crying or looking around.Stricklands body drifted slowly to the ground, the arms falling to the sides.The space where the head had been gouted bright arterial blood against the walls, each pulse smaller than the one before.Amos shrugged.Or that, Prax said.So you got any ideas how we   The hatch behind them opened and a man ran in.What happened?I heard   Amos raised the auto shotgun.The new man backpedaled, a thin whine of fear escaping from him as he retreated.Amos cleared his throat.Any idea how we get these kids out of here?Putting Mei back in the transport cart was one of the hardest things Prax had ever done.He wanted to carry her against him, to press his face against hers.It was a primate reaction, the deepest centers of his brain longing for the reassurance of physical contact.But his suit wouldnt protect her from the radiation or near vacuum of Ios sulfuric atmosphere, and the transport would.He nestled her gently against two other children while Amos put the other four in a second cart.The smallest of them was still in newborn diapers.Prax wondered if she had come from Ganymede too.The carts glided against the station flooring, only rattling when they crossed the built in tracks.You remember how to get back to the surface?Amos asked.I think so, Prax said.Uh, Doc?You really want to put your helmet back on.Oh!Right.Thank you.At the T intersection, half a dozen men in security uniforms had built a barricade, preparing to defend the lab against attack.Because Amos tossed in his grenades from the rear, the cover was less effective than the locals had anticipated, but it still took a few minutes to clear the bodies and the remains of the barricade to let the carts roll through.There was a time, Prax knew, that the violence would have bothered him.Not the blood or bodies.Hed spent more than enough time doing dissections and even autonomous limb vivisection to be able to wall off what he was seeing from any particular sense of visceral horror.But that it was something done in anger, that the men and women hed just seen blown apart hadnt donated their bodies or tissues, would have affected him once.The universe had taken that from him, and he couldnt say now exactly when it had happened.Part of him was numb, and maybe it always would be.There was a feeling of loss in that, but it was intellectual.The only emotions he felt were a glowing, transforming relief that Mei was here and alive and a vicious animal protectiveness that meant he would never let her leave his sight, possibly until she left for university.On the surface, the transports were rougher, the wheels less suited to the uneven surface of the land.Prax followed Amos example, turning the boxes around to pull them rather than push.Looking at the vectors, it made sense, but it wouldnt have occurred to him if he hadnt seen Amos doing it.Bobbie was walking slowly toward the Rocinante.Her suit was charred and stained and moving poorly.A clear fluid was leaking down the back.Dont get close to me, she said.Ive got protomolecule goo all over this thing.Thats bad, Amos said.You got a way to clean that off?Not really, she replied.Howd the extraction go?Got enough kids to start a singing group, but a little shy of a baseball team, Amos said.Meis here, Prax said.Shes all right.Im glad to hear that, Bobbie said, and even though she was clearly exhausted, she sounded like she meant it.At the airlock, Amos and Prax got in and nestled the transports against the back wall while Bobbie stood on the rough ground outside.Prax checked the transport indicators.There was enough onboard air to last another forty minutes.All right, Amos said.Were ready.Going for emergency blow, Bobbie said, and her armored suit came apart around her.It was a strange sight, the hard curves and layers of combat plate peeling themselves back, blooming out like a flower and then falling apart, and the woman, eyes closed and mouth open, being revealed.When she put her hand out for Amos to pull her in, the gesture reminded Prax of Mei seeing him again.Now, Doc, Amos said.Cycling, Prax said.He closed the outer door and started fresh air coming into the lock.Ten seconds later, Bobbies chest started to pump like a bellows.Thirty seconds, and they were at seven eighths of an atmosphere.Where do we stand, guys?Naomi asked as Prax opened the transport.The children were all asleep.Mei was sucking on her first two fingers, the way she had when she was a baby.He couldnt get past how much older she looked.Were solid, Amos said.I say we get the fuck out of here and glass the place.A fucking men, Avasaralas voice said in the background.Copy that, Naomi said.Were prepping for launch.Let me know when youve got all our new passengers safely in.Prax pulled off his helmet and sat beside Bobbie.In the black sheath of her base garments, she looked like someone just coming back from the gym.She could have been anybody.Glad you got your kid back, she said.Thank you.Im sorry you lost the suit, he said.She shrugged.At this point, it was mostly a metaphor anyway, she said, and the inner airlock opened.Cycles done, Naomi, Amos said.Were home.Fifty Two: Avasarala  It was over, except that it wasnt.It never was.Were all friends now, Souther said.Talking to him without lag was a luxury she was going to miss.But if we all limp back to our corners, were more likely to stay that way.Im thinking its going to be a question of years before either of our fleets are back up to what we were.There was a lot of damage.The children?Processing them.My medical officers in communication with a list of doctors who deal with pediatric immune problems.Its just about finding their parents and getting them all home now.Good, she said.Thats what I like to hear.And the other thing?Souther nodded.He looked younger in low gravity.They both did.Skin didnt sag when there was nothing to tug it down, and she could see what hed looked like as a boy.Weve got transponder locks on a hundred and seventy one packages.Theyre all moving sunward pretty fast, but theyre not accelerating or evading.Pretty much were standing back and letting them get close enough to Mars that disposal is trivial.You sure thats a good idea?By close, I mean still weeks away at current speed.Space is big.There was a pause that meant something other than distance.I wish youd ride back on one of ours, Souther said.And be stuck out here for another few weeks with the paperwork?Not going to happen.And besides, heading back with James Holden and Sergeant Roberta Draper and Mei Meng?It has all the right symbolism.Press will eat it up.Earth, Mars, the Outer Planets, and whatever the hell Holden is now.Celebrity, Souther said.A nation of its own.Hes not that bad once you get past the self righteousness.And anyway, this is the ship Im on, and theres nothing its waiting to repair before it starts its burn.And Ive already hired him.No ones giving me any shit about discretionary spending right now.All right, Souther said.Then Ill see you back down the well.See you there, she said, and cut the connection.She pulled herself up and launched gently across the ops deck.It would have been easy to push down the crew ladder shaft, flying the way shed dreamed of as a child.It tempted.In practice, she figured shed either push too hard and slam into something or else too gently and have air resistance stop her with nothing solid close enough to reach.She used the handholds and pulled herself slowly down toward the galley.Pressure doors opened at her approach and closed behind her with soft hydraulic hisses and metallic bangs.When she reached the crew deck, she heard the voices before she could make out the words, and the words before she saw the people.have to shut it down, Prax was saying.I mean, its false pretenses now.You dont think I could be sued, do you?You can always be sued, Holden said.Chances are they wouldnt win.But I dont want to be sued in the first place.We have to shut it down.I put a notice on the site so it gives a status update and asks for confirmation before any more money gets moved.She pulled herself into the galley.Prax and Holden were floating near the coffee machine.Prax wore a stunned expression, whereas Holden looked slightly smug.They both had bulbs of coffee, but Prax seemed to have forgotten his.The botanists eyes were wide and his mouth hung open, even in the microgravity.Whos getting sued?Avasarala asked.Now that we have Mei, Holden said, Prax wants people to stop giving him money.Its too much, the botanist said, looking at her as if he expected her to do something about it.I mean  Surplus funds?Avasarala asked.He cant quite retire on what hes got, Holden said.Not in luxury, anyway.But its yours, Prax said, turning to Holden with something like hope.You set up the account.I took the Rocinantes fees already.Trust me, you paid us generously, Holden said, hand out in a gesture of refusal.Whats still in theres all yours.Well, yours and Meis.Avasarala scowled.That changed her personal calculus a little.Shed thought this would be the right time to lock Prax into a contract, but Jim Holden had once again ridden in at the last moment and screwed everything up.Congratulations, Avasarala said.Has either of you seen Bobbie?I need to talk to her.Last I saw, she was heading for the machine shop.Thanks, Avasarala said, and kept pulling herself along.If Praxidike Meng was independently wealthy, that made him less likely to take on the job of rebuilding Ganymede for purely financial reasons.She could probably work the civic pride angle.He and his daughter were the face of the tragedy there, and having him running the show would mean more to people than all the facts and figures of how screwed theyd all be without the food supplies back online.He might be the kind of man whod be swayed by that.She needed to think about it.Once again, she was moving slowly and carefully enough that she heard the voices before she reached the machine shop.Bobbie and Amos, both of them laughing.She couldnt believe that she was walking in on an intimate moment, but it had that tickle fight sound to it.Then Mei shrieked with delight, and Avasarala understood.The machine shop was the last place in the ship, with the possible exception of engineering, that Avasarala would have thought about playing with a little girl, but there she was, arms and legs flailing through the air.Her shoulder length black hair flowed around her in a whirl, following the gentle end over end spin of her body.Her face was bright with pleasure.Bobbie and Amos stood at opposite ends of the shop.As Avasarala watched, Bobbie caught the little girl out of the air and launched her back toward Amos.Soon, Avasarala thought, the girl would start losing her milk teeth.She wondered how much of all this Mei would remember when she was an adult.Are you people crazy?Avasarala said as Amos caught the girl.This isnt a playground.Hey there, Amos said, we werent planning on staying long.The captain and the doc needed a minute, so I figured Id haul the kiddo down here.Give her the tour.When they send you to play catch with a child, they dont mean that shes the f that shes the ball, Avasarala said, moving across to him.Give that child to me.None of you people has any idea how to take care of a little girl.Its amazing you all lived to adulthood.Aint wrong about that, Amos said amiably, holding out the kid.Come to your nana, Avasarala said.Whats a nana?Mei asked.Im a nana, Avasarala said, gathering the child to her.Her body wanted to put the girl against her hip, to feel the weight bearing down on her.In microgravity holding a child felt odd.Good, but odd.Mei smelled of wax and vanilla.How much longer before we can get some thrust?I feel like a f like a balloon floating around in here.Soon as Alex and Naomi finish maintenance on the drive computers, were out of here, Amos said.Wheres my daddy?Mei asked.Good, Avasarala said.Weve got a schedule to keep, and Im not paying you people for floating lessons.Your daddys talking to the captain, Mei Mei.Where?the girl demanded.Where is he?I want my da!Ill get you back to him, kiddo, Amos said, holding out a massive hand.He shifted his attention to Avasarala.Shes good for about five minutes, then its Wheres Daddy?Good, Avasarala said.They deserve each other.Yeah, the big mechanic said.He pulled the child close to his center of gravity and launched up toward the galley.No handhold for him.Avasarala watched him go, then turned to Bobbie.Bobbie floated, her hair sprayed softly out around her.Her face and body were more relaxed than Avasarala remembered ever having seen them.It should have made her seem at peace, but all she could think was that the girl looked drowned.Hey, Bobbie said.Did you hear back from your tech guys on Earth?I did, Avasarala said.There was another energy spike.Bigger than the last ones.Prax was right.They are networked, and worse than that, they dont suffer lag.Venus reacted before the information about the battle could have reached it.Okay, Bobbie said.Thats bad, right?Its weird as tits on a bishop, but who knows if it means anything?Theyre talking about spin entanglement webs, whatever the hell those are.The best theory weve got is that its like a little adrenaline rush for the protomolecule.Some part of it is involved with violence, and the rest goes on alert until its clear the dangers passed.Well, then its scared of something.Nice to know it might have a vulnerability somewhere.They were silent for a moment.Somewhere far off in the ship, something clanged and Mei shrieked.Bobbie tensed, but Avasarala didnt.It was interesting to see people who hadnt been around a child react to Mei.They couldnt tell the difference between pleasure and alarm.Avasarala found that on this ship, she and Prax were the only experts in childrens screaming.I was looking for you, Avasarala said.Im here, Bobbie said, shrugging.Is that a problem?I dont follow.Is what a problem?That youre here?She looked away, her expression closing down.It was what Avasarala had expected.You were going down there to die, only the universe fucked you over again.You won.Youre alive.None of the problems go away.Some of them do, Bobbie said.Just not all.And at least we won your game.Avasaralas cough of a laugh was enough to set her spinning slightly.She reached out to the wall and steadied her drift.Thats the game I play.You never win.You just dont lose yet.Errinwright?He lost.Soren.Nguyen.I took them out of the game and I stayed in, but now?Errinwrights going to retire with extreme prejudice, and Im going to be given his job.Do you want it?It doesnt matter if I want it.Ill be offered it because if the bobble head doesnt offer it, people will think hes slighting me.And Ill take it because if I dont, people will think Im not hungry enough to be afraid of any longer.Ill be answering directly to the secretary general.Ill have more power, more responsibility.More friends and more enemies.Its the price of playing.Seems like there should be an alternative.There is.I could retire.Why dont you?Oh, I will, Avasarala said.The day my son comes home.What about you?Are you looking to quit?You mean am I still planning to get myself killed?Yes, that.There was a pause.That was good.It meant Bobbie was actually thinking about her answer.No, she said.I dont think so.Going down in a fights one thing.I can be proud of that.But just getting out to get out.I cant do that.Youre in an interesting position, Avasarala said.You think about what to do with it.And what position is that?Ronin?A traitor to your government and a patriotic hero.A martyr who didnt die.A Martian whose best and only friend is about to run the government of Earth.Youre not my only friend, Bobbie said.Bullshit.Alex and Amos dont count.They only want to get into your pants.And you dont?Avasarala laughed again.Bobbie was at least smiling.It was more than shed done since shed come back.Her sigh was deep and melancholy.I still feel haunted, she said.I thought it would go away.I thought if I faced it, it would all go away.It doesnt go away.Ever.But you get better at it.At what?At being haunted, Avasarala said.Think about what you want to do.Think about who you want to become.And then see me, and I will make it happen for you if I can.Why?Bobbie asked.Seriously, why?Im a soldier.I did the mission.And yes, it was harder and stranger than anything Ive ever done, but I got it done.I did it because it needed doing.You dont owe me anything.Avasarala hoisted an eyebrow.Political favors are how I express affection, she said.Okay, people, Alexs voice said across the ships PA.Were back up and commencing burn in thirty seconds unless someone says otherwise.Everybody get ready to weigh something.I appreciate the offer, Bobbie said.But it may be a while before I know if I want to take it.What will you do, then?Next, I mean.Im going home, she said.I want to see my family.My dad.I think Ill stay there for a while.Figure out who I am.How to start over.Like that.The doors open, Bobbie.Whenever you want it, the door is open.The flight back to Luna was a pain in the ass.Avasarala spent seven hours a day in her crash couch, sending messages back and forth against different levels of lag.On Earth, Sadavir Errinwright was quietly celebrated, his career with the UN honored with a small and private ceremony, and then he went off to spend more time with his family or farm chickens or whatever he was going to do with the remaining decades until death.Whatever it was, it wouldnt involve wielding political power.The investigation into the Io base was ongoing, and heads were quietly rolling on Earth.But not on Mars.Whoever in the Martian government had been bidding against Errinwright, they were going to get away with it.By losing the most powerful biological weapon in human history, theyd saved their own careers.Politics was full of little ironies like that.Avasarala put together her own new office in absentia.By the time she stepped into it, it would already have been running for a month.It felt like driving a car while sitting in the backseat.She hated it.In addition, Mei Meng had decided she was funny, and spent part of each day monopolizing her attention.She didnt have time to play with a little girl, except that of course she did.So she did.And she had to exercise so that they wouldnt have to put her in a nursing home when she got back to a full g.  The steroid cocktail gave her hot flashes and made it hard to sleep.Both her granddaughters had birthdays she could attend only on a screen.One had twenty minutes lag; one had four.When they passed the cloud of protomolecule monsters speeding in toward the sun, she had nightmares for two nights running, but they gradually stopped.Every one of them was being tracked by two governments, and Errinwrights little packets of death were all quiescent and speeding quietly and happily toward their own destruction.She couldnt wait to be home.When they docked on Luna, it was like a starving woman with a slice of apple touched to her lips, but not allowed to bite.The soft blue and white of the daylight planet, the black and gold of night.It was a beautiful world.Unmatched in the solar system.Her garden was down there.Her office.Her own bed.But Arjun was not.He was waiting for her on the landing pad in his best suit with a spray of fresh lilacs in his hand.The low gravity made him look younger too, if a little bloodshot about the eyes.She could feel the curiosity of Holden and his crew as she walked toward him.Who was this man that he could stand to be married to someone as abrasive and hard as Chrisjen Avasarala?Was this her master or her victim?How would that even work?Welcome home, Arjun said softly as she leaned into his arms.He smelled like himself.She put her head against his shoulder, and she didnt need Earth so badly any longer.This was home enough.Fifty Three: Holden  Hi, Mom.Were on Luna!The light delay from Luna was less than six seconds for a round trip, but it was enough to add an awkward pause before each response.Mother Elise stared out at him from his hotel rooms video screen for five long heartbeats; then her face lit up.Jimmy!Are you coming down?She meant down the well.Coming home.Holden felt an ache to do exactly that.It had been years since hed been to the farm in Montana that his parents owned.But this time he had Naomi with him, and Belters didnt go to Earth.No, Mom, not this time.But I want all of you to come meet me up here.The shuttle ride is my treat.And UN Undersecretary Avasarala is hosting, so the accommodations are pretty posh.When there was comm lag, it was difficult not to ramble on.The other person never sent the subtle physical cues that signaled it was their turn to talk.Holden forced himself to stop babbling and wait for a reply.Elise stared at the screen, waiting out the lag.Holden could see how much shed aged in the years since his last trip home.Her dark brown, almost black, hair was streaked with gray, and the laugh lines around her eyes and mouth had deepened.After five seconds, she waved a hand at the screen in a dismissive gesture.Oh, Tom will never ride a shuttle to Luna.You know that.He hates microgravity.Just come down and see us here.Well throw a party.You can bring your friends here.Holden smiled at her.Mom, I need you guys to come up here because I have someone I want you to meet.Remember the woman?Naomi Nagata, the one I told you about?I told you Ive been seeing her.I think it might be more than that.In fact, Im kind of sure about it now.And now well be on Luna while a whole lot of political bullshit gets straightened out.I really want you guys to come up.See me, meet Naomi.It was almost too subtle to catch, the way his mother flinched five seconds later.She covered it with a big smile.More than that?What does that mean?Like, getting married?I always thought youd want kids of your own someday She trailed off, maintaining an uncomfortably stiff smile.Mom, Holden said.Earthers and Belters can have kids just fine.Were not a different species.Sure, she said a few seconds later, nodding too quickly.But if you have children out there   She stopped, her smile fading a bit.Then theyll be Belters, Holden said.Yeah, you guys are just going to have to be okay with that.After five seconds, she nodded.Again, too quickly.Then I guess we better come up and meet this woman youre willing to leave Earth behind for.She must be very special.Yeah, Holden said.She is.Elise shifted uncomfortably for a second; then her smile came back, far less forced.Ill get Tom on that shuttle if I have to drag him by the hair.I love you, Mom, Holden said.His parents had spent their whole lives on Earth.The only outer planets types they knew were the caricature villains that showed up on bad entertainment feeds.He didnt hold their ingrained prejudices against them, because he knew that meeting Naomi would be the cure for it.A few days spent in her company and they wouldnt be able to help falling in love with her.Oh, one last thing.That data I sent you a while back?Hang on to that for me.Keep it quiet, but keep it.Depending on how things fall out over the next couple of months, I may need it.My parents are racists, Holden said to Naomi later that night.She lay curled against his side, her face against his ear.One long brown leg thrown across his hips.Okay, she whispered.The hotel suite Avasarala had provided for them was luxurious to the point of opulence.The mattress was so soft that in the lunar gravity it was like floating on a cloud.The air recycling system pumped in subtle scents handcrafted by the hotels in house perfumer.That nights selection was called Windblown Grass.It didnt exactly smell like grass to Holden, but it was nice.Just a hint of earthiness to it.Holden had a suspicion that all perfumes were named randomly, anyway.He also suspected that the hotel ran the oxygen just a little higher than normal.He felt a little too good.Theyre worried our babies will be Belters, he said.No babies, Naomi whispered.Before Holden could ask what she meant, she was snoring in his ear.The next day, he woke before Naomi, dressed in the best suit he owned, and headed out into the station.There was one last thing he had to do before he could call this whole bloody affair truly over.He had to see Jules Mao.Avasarala had told him that Mao was one of several dozen high ranking politicians, generals, and corporate leaders rounded up in the mass of arrests following Io.He was the only one Avasarala was going to see personally.And, since theyd caught him on his L5 station frantically trying to get on a fast ship to the outer planets, shed just had him brought to her on Luna.That day was the day of their meeting.Hed asked Avasarala if he could be there, expecting a no.Instead, she laughed a good, long time and said, Holden, there is literally nothing I can think of that will be more humiliating to that man than having you watch me dismantle him.Fuck yes, you can come.So Holden hurried out of the hotel and onto the streets of Lovell City.A quick pedicab ride got him to the tube station, and a twenty minute tube ride took him to the New Hague United Nations complex.A perky young page was waiting for him when he arrived, and he was escorted efficiently through the complexs twisty maze of corridors to a door marked CONFERENCE ROOM 34.You can wait inside, sir, the perky page chirped at him.No, you know?Holden said, clapping the boy on the shoulder.I think Ill wait out here.The page dipped his head slightly and bustled off down the corridor, already looking at his hand terminal for whatever his next task was.Holden leaned against the corridor wall and waited.In the low gravity, standing was hardly any more effort than sitting, and he really wanted to see Mao perp walked down the hallway to his meeting.His terminal buzzed, and he got a short text message from Avasarala.It said ON OUR WAY.Less than five minutes later, Jules Pierre Mao climbed off an elevator into the corridor, flanked by two of the largest military police officers Holden had ever seen.Mao had his hands cuffed in front of him.Even wearing a prisoners jumpsuit, hands in restraints, and with armed guards escorting him, he managed to look arrogant and in control.As they approached, Holden stood up straight and stepped in their way.One of the MPs yanked on Maos arm to stop him and gave Holden a subtle nod.It seemed to say, Im down for whatever with this guy.Holden had a sense that if he yanked a pistol out of his pants and shot Mao right there in the corridor, the two MPs would discover they had both been struck with blindness at the same moment and failed to see anything.But he didnt want to shoot Mao.He wanted what he always seemed to want in these situations.He wanted to know why.Was it worth it?Even though they were the same height, Mao managed to frown down at him.You are?Awww, come on, Holden said with a grin.You know me.Im James Holden.I helped bring down your pals at Protogen, and now Im about to finish that job with you.Im also the one that found your daughter after the protomolecule had killed her.So Ill ask again: Was it worth it?Mao didnt answer.A dead daughter, a company in ruins, millions of people slaughtered, a solar system that will probably never have peaceful stability again.Was it worth it?Why are you here?Mao finally asked.He looked smaller when he said it.He wouldnt make eye contact.I was there, in the room, when Dresden got his and Im the man who killed your pet admiral.I just feel like theres this wonderful symmetry in being there when you get yours.Antony Dresden, Mao said, was shot in the head three times execution style.Is that what passes for justice with you?Holden laughed.Oh, I doubt Chrisjen Avasarala is going to shoot you in the face.Do you think whats coming will be better?Mao didnt reply, and Holden looked at the MP and gestured toward the conference room door.They almost looked disappointed as they pushed Mao into the room and attached his restraints to a chair.Well be waiting out here, sir, if you need us, the larger of the two MPs said.They took up flanking positions next to the door.Holden went into the conference room and took a chair, but he didnt say anything else to Mao.A few moments later, Avasarala shuffled into the room, talking on her hand terminal.I dont give a fuck whose birthday it is, you make this happen before my meeting is over or Ill have your nuts as paperweights.She paused as the person on the other end said something.She grinned at Mao and said, Well, go fast, because I have a feeling my meeting will be short.Good talking to you.She sank into a chair directly across the table from Mao.She didnt look at Holden or acknowledge him at all.He suspected that the record would never reflect his presence in the room.Avasarala put her terminal on the tabletop and leaned back in her chair.She didnt speak for several tense seconds.When she did, it was to Holden.She still didnt look at him.Youve gotten paid for hauling me back here?Payments cleared, Holden said.Thats good.I wanted to ask you about a longer term contract.It would be civilian, of course, but   Mao cleared his throat.Avasarala smiled at him.I know youre there.Ill be right with you.Ive already got a contract, Holden said.Were escorting the first reconstruction flotilla to Ganymede.And after that, Im thinking well probably be able to get another escort gig from there.Still a lot of people relocating whod rather not get stopped by pirates along the way.Youre sure?Maos face was white with humiliation.Holden let himself enjoy it.Ive just gotten done working for a government, Holden said.I didnt wear it well.Oh please.You worked for the OPA.Thats not a government, its a rugby scrum with a currency.Yes, Jules, what is it?You need to go to the potty?This is beneath you, Mao said.I didnt come here to be insulted.Avasaralas smile was incandescent.Youre sure about that?Let me ask, do you remember what I said the first time we met?You asked me to tell you about any involvement I might have had with the protomolecule project run by Protogen.No, Avasarala replied.I mean, yes, I did ask that.But thats not the part that you should be caring about right now.You lied to me.Your involvement with weaponizing the Protogen project is fully exposed, and that question is like asking what color Tuesday was.Its meaningless.Lets get down to brass tacks, Mao said.I can   No, Avasarala interrupted.The part you should be caring about is what I said just before you left.Do you remember that?He looked blankly up at her.I didnt think so.I told you that if I found out later youd hidden something from me, I wouldnt take it well.Your exact words, Mao said with a mocking grin, were I am not someone you want to fuck with.So you do remember, she said, not a hint of humor in her tone.Good.This is where you get to find out what that means.I have additional information that could be of benefit   Shut the fuck up, Avasarala said, real anger creeping into her voice for the first time.Next time I hear your voice, I have those two big MPs in the hallway hold you down and beat you with a fucking chair.Do you understand me?Mao didnt reply, which showed that he did.You dont have any idea what youve cost me, she said.Im being promoted.The economic planning council?I run it now.The public health service?I never had to worry about it because that was Errinwrights pain in the ass.Its mine now.The committee on financial regulation?Mine.Youve fucked up my calendar for the next two decades.This is not a negotiation, Avasarala continued.This is me gloating.Im going to drop you into a hole so deep even your wife will forget you ever existed.Im going to use Errinwrights old position to dismantle everything you ever built, piece by piece, and scatter it to the winds.Ill make sure you get to watch it happening.The one thing your hole will have is twenty four hour news.And since you and I will never meet again, I want to make sure my name is on your mind every time I destroy something else you left behind.I am going to erase you.Mao stared back defiantly, but Holden could see it was just a shell.Avasarala had known exactly where to hit him.Because men like him lived for their legacy.They saw themselves as the architects of the future.What Avasarala was promising was worse than death.Mao shot a quick look at Holden, and it seemed to say, Ill take those three shots to the head now, please.Holden smiled at him.Fifty Four: Prax  Mei sat on Praxs lap, but her attention was focused with a laser intensity to her left.She put her hand up to her mouth and gently, deliberately deposited a wad of half chewed spaghetti into her palm, then held it out toward Amos.Its yucky, she said.The big man chuckled.Well, if it wasnt before, it sure is now, pumpkin, he said, unfolding his napkin.Why dont you put that right here?Im sorry, Prax said.Shes just   Shes just a kid, Doc, Amos said.This is what shes supposed to do.They didnt call the dinner a dinner.It was a reception sponsored by the United Nations at the New Hague facilities on Luna.Prax couldnt tell if the wall was a window or an ultrahigh definition screen.On it, Earth glowed blue and white on the horizon.The tables were spread around the room in a semi organic array that Avasarala had explained was the current fashion.Makes it look like some asshole just put them up anywhere.The room was almost equally people he knew and people he didnt, and watching them segregate was fascinating in its way.To his right, several small tables were filled with short, stocky men and women in professional suits and military uniforms orbiting around Avasarala and her amused looking husband, Arjun.They gossiped about funding system analysis and media relations control.Every outer planets hand they shook was an inclusion that their subjects of conversation denied.To his left, the scientific group was dressed in the best clothes they had, dress jackets that had fit ten years before, and suits representing at least half a dozen different design seasons.Earthers and Martians and Belters all mixed in that group, but the talk was just as exclusionary: nutrient grades, adjustable permeability membrane technologies, phenotypic force expressions.Those were both his people from the past and his future.The shattered and reassembled society of Ganymede.If it hadnt been for the middle table with Bobbie and the crew of the Rocinante, he would have been there, talking about cascade arrays and non visible feeding chloroplasts.But in the center, isolated and alone, Holden and his crew were as happy and at peace as if theyd been in their own galley, burning through the vacuum.And Mei, who had taken a fancy to Amos, still wouldnt be physically parted from Prax without starting to yell and cry.Prax understood exactly how the girl felt, and didnt see it as a problem.So living on Ganymede, you know a lot about low gravity childbearing, right?Holden said.Its not really that much riskier for Belters, is it?Prax swallowed a mouthful of salad and shook his head.Oh, no.Its tremendously difficult.Especially if its just a shipboard situation without extensive medical controls.If you look at naturally occurring pregnancies, theres a developmental or morphological abnormality five times out of six.Five Holden said.Most of them are germ line issues, though, Prax said.Nearly all of the children born on Ganymede were implanted after a full genetic analysis.If theres a lethal equivalent, they just drop the zygote and start over.Non germ line abnormalities are only twice as common as on Earth, though, so thats not so bad.Ah, Holden said, looking crestfallen.Why do you ask?No reason, Naomi said.Hes just making conversation.Daddy, I want tofu, Mei said, grabbing his earlobe and yanking it.Wheres tofu?Lets see if we cant find you some tofu, Prax said, pushing his chair back from the table.Come on.As he walked across the room, scanning the crowd for a dark, formal suit belonging to a waiter as opposed to a dark, formal suit belonging to a diplomat, a young woman came up to him with a drink in one hand and a flush on her cheeks.Youre Praxidike Meng, she said.You probably dont remember me.Um.No, he said.Im Carol Kiesowski, she said, touching her collarbone as if to clarify what she meant by I.  We wrote to each other a couple of times right after you put out the video about Mei.Oh, right, Prax said, trying desperately to remember anything about the woman or the comments she might have left.I just want to say I think both of you are just so, so brave, the woman said, nodding.It occurred to Prax that she might be drunk.Son of a fucking whore, Avasarala said, loud enough to cut through the background buzz of conversations.The crowd turned to her.She was looking at her hand terminal.Whats a whore, Daddy?Its a kind of frost, honey, Prax said.Whats going on?Holdens old boss beat us to the punch, Avasarala said.I guess we know what happened to all those fucking missiles he stole.Arjun touched his wifes shoulder and pointed at Prax.She actually looked abashed.Sorry for the language, she said.I forgot about her.Holden appeared at Praxs shoulder.My boss?Fred Johnson just put on a display, Avasarala said.Nguyens monsters?Weve been waiting for them to come closer to Mars before we took them down.Transponders are all chirping away, and weve got them all tracked tighter than a flys Well, they crossed into the Belt, and he nuked them.All of them.Thats good, though, Prax said.I mean, isnt that good?Not if hes doing it, Avasarala said.Hes flexing muscles.Showing that the Belts got an offensive arsenal now.A man in uniform to Avasaralas left started talking at the same time as a woman just behind her, and in a moment, the need to declaim had spread through the whole group.Prax pulled away.The drunk woman was pointing at a man and talking rapidly, Prax and Mei forgotten.He found a waiter at the edge of the room, extracted a promise of tofu, and went back to his seat.Amos and Mei immediately started playing at who could blow their nose the hardest, and Prax turned to Bobbie.Are you going to go back to Mars, then?he asked.It seemed like a polite, innocuous question until Bobbie pressed her lips tight and nodded.I am, she said.Turns out my brothers getting married.Im going to try to get there in time to screw up his bachelor party.What about you?Taking the old ladys position?Well, I think so, Prax said, a little surprised that Bobbie had heard about Avasaralas offer.It hadnt been made public yet.I mean, all of the basic advantages of Ganymede are still there.The magnetosphere, the ice.If even some of the mirror arrays can be salvaged, it would still be better than starting again from nothing.I mean, the thing you have to understand about Ganymede  Once he started on the subject, it was hard for him to stop.In many ways, Ganymede had been the center of civilization in the outer planets.All the cutting edge plant work had been there.All the life sciences issues.But it was more than that.There was something exciting about the prospect of rebuilding that was, in its fashion, even more interesting than the initial growth.To do something the first time was an exploration.To do it again was to take all the things they had learned, and refine, improve, perfect.It left Prax a little bit giddy.Bobbie listened with a melancholy smile on her face.And it wasnt only Ganymede.All of human civilization had been built out of the ruins of what had come before.Life itself was a grand chemical improvisation that began with the simplest replicators and grew and collapsed and grew again.Catastrophe was just one part of what always happened.It was a prelude to what came next.You make it sound romantic, Bobbie said, and the way she said it was almost an accusation.I dont mean to   Prax began, and something cold and wet wriggled its way into his ear.He pulled back with a yelp, turning to face Meis bright eyes and brilliant smile.Her index finger dripped with saliva, and beyond her Amos was laughing himself crimson, one hand grasping at his belly and the other slapping the table hard enough to make the plates rattle.What was that?Hi, Daddy.I love you.Here, Alex said, passing Prax a clean napkin.Youre gonna want that.The startling thing was the silence.He didnt know how long it had been going on, but the awareness of it washed over him like a wave.The political half of the room was still and quiet.Through the forest of their bodies, he saw Avasarala bending forward, her elbows on her knees, her hand terminal inches in front of her face.When she stood up, they parted before her.She was such a small woman, but she commanded the room just by walking out of it.Thats not good, Holden said, rising to his feet.Without another word, Prax and Naomi, Amos and Alex and Bobbie all followed after her.The politicians and the scientists came too, all of them mixing at last.The meeting room was across a wide hall and set up in the model of an ancient Greek amphitheater.The podium at the front stood before a massive high definition screen.Avasarala marched down to a seat, talking fast and low into her hand terminal.The others trailed in after her.The sense of dread was physical.The screen went black and someone dimmed the lights.In the darkness of the screen, Venus stood in near silhouette against the sun.It was an image Prax had seen hundreds of times before.The feed could have come from any of a dozen monitoring stations.The time stamp on the lower left said they were looking back in time forty seven minutes.A ship name, the Celestine, floated beneath the numbers.Every time the protomolecule soldiers had been involved in violence, Venus had reacted.The OPA had just destroyed a hundred of its half human soldiers.Prax felt himself caught between excitement and dread.The image scattered and re formed, some kind of interference confusing the sensors.Avasarala said something sharp that could have been show me.A few seconds later, the image stopped and reframed.A detail screen showing a gray green ship.A heads up display marked it the Merman.The image scattered again, and when it re formed, the Merman had moved half an inch to the left and was spinning end over end, tumbling.Avasarala spoke again.A few seconds lag, and the screen went back to its original image.Now that Prax knew to look, he could see the tiny dot of the Merman moving near the penumbra.There were other tiny specks like it.The dark side of Venus pulsed like a sudden, planetary flash of lightning under the obscuring clouds.And then it glowed.Vast filaments thousands of kilometers long like spokes on a wheel lit white and vanished.The clouds of Venus shifted, disturbed from below.Prax had the powerful memory of seeing a wake on the surface of a water tank when a fish passed close underneath.Vast and glowing, it rose through the cloud cover.Spoke like strands of iridescence arced with vast lightning storms, coming together like the arms of an octopus but connected to a rigid central node.Once it had climbed out of Venus thick cloud cover, it launched itself away from the sun, toward the viewing ship, but passing it.The other ships in its path were scattered and hurled away.A long plume of displaced Venusian atmosphere caught the sun and glowed like snowflakes and slivers of ice.Prax tried to make sense of the scale.As large as Ceres Station.As large as Ganymede.Larger.It folded its arms its tentacles together, accelerating without any visible drive plume.It swam in the void.His heart was racing, but his body was still as stone.Mei patted his cheek with her open palm and pointed to the screen.Whats that?she asked.Epilogue: Holden  Holden started the replay again.The wall screen in the Rocinantes galley was too small to really catch all the details of the high resolution imagery the Celestine had taken.But Holden couldnt stop watching it no matter what room he was in.An ignored cup of coffee cooled on the table in front of him next to the sandwich he hadnt eaten.Venus flashed with light in an intricate pattern.The heavy cloud cover swirled as though caught in a planetwide storm.And then it rose from the surface, pulling a thick contrail of Venus atmosphere in its wake.Come to bed, Naomi said, then leaned forward in her chair and took his hand.Get some sleep.Its so big.And the way it swatted all those ships out of the way.Effortless, like a whale swimming through a school of guppies.Can you do anything about it?This is the end, Naomi, Holden said, pulling his eyes away from the screen to look at her.What if this is the end?This isnt some alien virus anymore.This thing is what the protomolecule came here to make.This is what it was going to hijack all life on the Earth to make.It could be anything.Can you do anything about it?she repeated.Her words were harsh, but her voice was kind and she squeezed his fingers affectionately.Holden turned back to the screen, restarting the image.A dozen ships blew away from Venus as though a massive wind had caught them and sent them spinning like leaves.The surface of the atmosphere began to roil and twist.Okay, Naomi said, standing up.Im going to bed.Dont wake me when you come in.Im exhausted.Holden nodded to her without looking away from the video feed.The massive shape folded itself into a streamlined dart, like a piece of wet cloth plucked up from the center, then flew away.The Venus it left behind looked diminished, somehow.As though something vital had been stolen from it to construct the alien artifact.And here it was.After all the fighting, with human civilization left in chaos just from its presence, the protomolecule had finished the job it came billions of years before to do.Would humanity survive it?Would the protomolecule even notice them, now that it had finished its grand work?It wasnt the ending of one thing that left Holden terrified.It was the prospect of something beginning that was utterly outside the human experience.Whatever happened next, no one could be prepared for it.It scared the hell out of him.Behind him, a man cleared his throat.Holden turned reluctantly away from the image on the screen.The man stood next to the galley refrigerator as if hed always been there, rumpled gray suit and dented porkpie hat.A bright blue firefly flew off his cheek, then hung in the air beside him.He waved it away like it was a gnat.His expression was one of discomfort and apology.Hey, Detective Miller said.We gotta talk.
