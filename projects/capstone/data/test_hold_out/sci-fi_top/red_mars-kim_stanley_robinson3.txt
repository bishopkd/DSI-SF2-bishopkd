It blurred for Nadia, she was always busy.The interior construction of the vaulted chambers was complicated, and the robots couldnt help much with plumbing, heating, gas exchange, locks, and kitchens.Nadias team had all the fixtures and tools, and could work in pants and sweatshirts, but still it took an amazing amount of time.Work work work, day after day!One evening, just before sunset, Nadia trudged across torn up dirt to the trailer park, feeling hungry and beat and extremely relaxed, totally at ease, not that you didnt have to be careful at the end of a day, she had torn a centimeter hole in the back of a glove the other evening being careless, and the cold hadnt been so bad, about minus 50 degrees Centigrade, nothing compared to some Siberian winter days but the low air pressure had sucked out a blood bruise instantly, and then that had started to freeze up, which made the bruise smaller no doubt, but slower to heal as well.Anyway, you had to be careful, but there was something so fluid about tired muscles at the end of a days construction work, the low rust sunlight slanting across the rocky plain, and all of a sudden she could feel that she was happy.Arkady called in from Phobos at just that moment, and she greeted him cheerily.I feel just like a Louis Armstrong solo from 1947.Why 1947?he asked.Well, that was the year he sounded the most happy.Most of his life his tone has a sharp edge to it, really beautiful, but in 1947 it was even more beautiful because it has this relaxed fluid joy, you never hear it in him before or after.A good year for him, I take it?Oh yes!An amazing year!After twenty years of horrible big bands, you see, he got back to a little group like the Hot Five, that was the group he headed when he was young, and there it was, the old songs, even some of the old faces and all of it better than the first time, you know, the recording technology, the money, the audiences, the band, his own power....It must have felt like the fountain of youth, I tell you.Youll have to send up some recordings, Arkady said.He tried to sing: I cant give you anything but love, baby!Phobos was about over the horizon, he had just been calling to say hi.So this is your 1947, he said before he went.Nadia put her tools away, singing the song correctly.And she understood that what Arkady had said was true; something had happened to her similar to what had happened to Armstrong in 1947 because despite the miserable conditions, her youthful years in Siberia had been the happiest of her life, they really had.And then she had endured twenty years of big band cosmonautics, bureaucracy, simulations, an indoor life all to get here.And now suddenly she was out in the open again, building things with her hands, operating heavy machinery, solving problems a hundred times a day, just like Siberia only better.It was just like Satchmos return!Thus when Hiroko came up and said, Nadia, this crescent wrench is absolutely frozen in this position, Nadia sang to her, Thats the only thing Im thinking of baby!and took the crescent wrench and slammed it against a table like a hammer, and twiddled the dial to show Hiroko it was unstuck, and laughed at her expression.The engineers solution, she explained, and went humming into the lock, thinking how funny Hiroko was, a woman who held their whole ecosystem in her head, but couldnt hammer a nail straight.And that night she talked over the days work with Sax, and spoke to Spencer about glass, and in the middle of that conversation crashed on her bunk and snuggled her head into her pillow, feeling totally luxurious, the glorious final chorus of Aint Misbehavin   chasing her off to sleep.But things change as time passes; nothing lasts, not even stone, not even happiness.Do you realize its ell ess one seventy already?Phyllis said one night.Didnt we land at ell ess seven?So they had been on Mars for half a Martian year.Phyllis was using the calendar devised by planetary scientists; among the colonists it was becoming more common than the Terran system.Marss year was 668.6 local days long, and to tell where they were in this long year it took the Ls calendar.This system declared the line between the sun and Mars at its northern spring equinox to be O, and then the year was divided into 360 degrees, so that Ls = 0   90 was the northern spring, 9  180 the northern summer, 18   270 the fall, and 27   360 (or 0 again) the winter.This simple situation was complicated by the eccentricity of the Martian orbit, which is extreme by Terran standards, for at perihelion Mars is about forty three million kilometers closer to the sun than it is at aphelion, and thus receiving about 45 percent more sunlight.This fluctuation makes the southern and northern seasons quite unequal.Perihelion arrives every year at Ls = 250, late in the southern spring; so southern springs and summers are much hotter than northern springs and summers, with peak temperatures as much as thirty degrees higher.Southern autumns and winters are colder, however, occurring as they do near aphelion so much colder that the southern polar cap is mostly carbon dioxide, while the northern one is mostly water ice.So the south was the hemisphere of extremes, the north that of moderation.And the orbital eccentricity caused one other feature of note; planets move faster the closer they are to the sun, so the seasons near perihelion are shorter than those near aphelion; Marss northern autumn is 143 days long, for instance, while northern spring is 194.Spring fifty one days longer than autumn!Some claimed this alone made it worth settling in the north.In any case in the north they were, and summer had passed.The days got shorter by a little bit every day, and the work went on.The area around the base got more cluttered, more crisscrossed with tracks.They had laid a cement road to Chernobyl, and the base itself was now so big that from the trailer park it extended over the horizon in all directions: the alchemists quarter and the Chernobyl road to the east, the permanent habitat to the north, the storage area and the farm to the west, and the biomed center to the south.The Martian Calendar    Year 1 (2027 AD)      669 total Martain days in 1 Martain year    24 months =    21 months at 28 days    3 months (every eighth) at 27 days    Eventually everyone moved into the finished chambers of the permanent habitat.The nightly conferences there were shorter and more routinized than they had been in the trailer park, and days went by when Nadia got no calls for help.There were some people she saw only once in a while; the biomed crew in its labs, Phylliss prospecting unit, even Ann.One night Ann flopped on her bed next to Nadias, and invited her to go along on an exploration to Hebes Chasma, some 130 kilometers to the southwest.Obviously Ann wanted to show her something outside the base area, but Nadia declined.Ive got too much work to do, you know.And seeing Anns disappointment: Maybe next trip.And then it was back to work on the interiors of the chambers, and the exteriors of a new wing.Arkady had suggested making the line of chambers the first of four, arranged in a square, and Nadia was going to do it; as Arkady pointed out, it would then be possible to roof the area enclosed by the square.Thats where those magnesium beams will come in handy, Nadia said.If only we could make stronger glass panes....They had finished two sides of the square, twelve chambers entirely done, when Ann and her team returned from Hebes.Everyone spent that evening looking at their videotapes.These showed the expeditions rovers rolling over rocky plains; then ahead there appeared a break extending all the way across the screen, as if they were approaching the edge of the world.Strange little meter high cliffs finally stopped the rovers, and the pictures bounced as one explorer got out and walked with helmet camera turned on.Then abruptly the shot was from the rim, a one eighty pan shot of a canyon that was so much bigger than the sinkholes of Ganges Catena that it was hard to grasp.The walls of the far side of the chasm were just visible on the distant horizon.In fact they could see walls all the way around, for Hebes was an almost enclosed chasm, a sunken ellipse about two hundred kilometers long and a hundred across.Anns party had come to the north rim in late afternoon, and the eastern curve of the wall was clearly visible, flooded by sunset light; out to the west the wall was just a low dark mark.The floor of the chasm was generally flat, with a central dip.If you could float a dome over the chasma, Ann said, youd have a nice big enclosure.Youre talking miracle domes, Ann, Sax said.Thats about ten thousand square kilometers.Well, it would make a good big enclosure.And then you could leave the rest of the planet alone.The weight of a dome would collapse the canyon walls.Thats why I said youd have to float it.Sax just shook his head.Its no more exotic than this space elevator you talk about.I want to live in a house located right where you took this video, Nadia interrupted.What a view!Just wait till you get up on one of the Tharsis volcanoes, Ann said, irritated.Then youll get a view.There were little spats like that all the time now.It reminded Nadia unpleasantly of the last months on the Ares.Another example: Arkady and his crew sent down videos of Phobos, with his commentary.The Stickney impact almost broke this rock in pieces, and its chondritic, almost twenty percent water, so a lot of the water outgassed on impact and filled the fracture system and froze in a whole system of ice veins.Fascinating stuff, but all it did was cause an argument between Ann and Phyllis, their two top geologists, as to whether this was the real explanation for the ice.Phyllis even suggested shipping water down from Phobos, which was silly, even if their supplies were low and their demand increasing.Chernobyl took a lot of water, and the farmers were ready to start a little swamp in their biosphere, and Nadia wanted to install a swimming complex in one of the vaulted chambers, including a lap pool, three whirlpool baths, and a sauna.Each night people asked Nadia how it was coming along, because everyone was sick of washing with sponges and still being dusty, and of never really getting warm.They wanted a bath in their old aquatic dolphin brains, down below the cerebrums, down where desires were primal and fierce, they wanted back into water.So they needed more water, but the seismic scans were finding no evidence of ice aquifers underground, and Ann thought there werent any in the region.They had to continue to rely on the air miners, or scrape up regolith and load it into the soil water distilleries.But Nadia didnt like to overwork the distilleries, because they had been manufactured by a French Hungarian Chinese consortium, and were sure to wear out if used for bulk work.But that was life on Mars; it was a dry place.Shikata ga nai.There are always choices, Phyllis said to that.This was why she had suggested filling landing vehicles with Phobos ice, and bringing it on down.But Ann thought that was a ridiculous waste of energy, and they were off again.It was especially irritating to Nadia because she herself was in such a good mood.She saw no reason to quarrel, and it disturbed her that the others didnt feel the same.Why did the dynamics of a group fluctuate so?Here they were on Mars, where the seasons were twice as long as Earths, and every day was forty minutes longer: why couldnt people relax?Nadia had a sense that there was time for things even though she was always busy, and the extra thirty nine and a half minutes per day was probably the most important component of this feeling; human circadian biorhythms had been set over millions of years of evolution, and now suddenly to have extra minutes of day and night, day after day, night after night no doubt it had effects.Nadia was sure of it, because despite the hectic pace of every days work, and the way she passed out in sheer exhaustion every night, she always woke rested.That strange pause on the digital clocks, when at midnight the figures hit 12:00:00 and suddenly stopped, and the unmarked time passed, passed, passed, sometimes it seemed for a very long time indeed; and then snapped on to 12:00:01, and began its usual inexorable flicker well, the Martian timeslip was something special.Often Nadia was asleep through it, as were most of the rest of them.But Hiroko had a chant that she chanted during it when she was up, and she and the farm team, and many of the rest of them, spent every Saturday night partying and chanting that chant through the timeslip something in Japanese, Nadia never learned what, though she sometimes hummed along, sitting enjoying the vault and her friends.But one Saturday night when she sat there, nearly comatose, Maya came over and sat against her shoulder for a talk.Maya with her beautiful face, always well groomed, always the latest in chicarnost even in their everyday jumpsuits, looking distraught.Nadia, you have to do me a favor, please, please.What.I need you to tell something to Frank for me.Why dont you do it yourself?I cant have John seeing us talk!I have to get a message to him, and please, Nadezhda Francine, youre my only way.Please.Nadia made a disgusted noise.It was suprising how much Nadia would have rather been talking to Ann, or Samantha, or Arkady.If only Arkady would come down from Phobos!But Maya was her friend.And that desperate look on her face: Nadia couldnt stand it.What message?Tell him that Ill meet him tonight in the storage area, Maya said imperiously.At midnight.To talk.Nadia sighed.But later she went to Frank, and gave him the message.He nodded without meeting her eye, embarrassed, grim, unhappy.Then a few days later Nadia and Maya were cleaning up the brick floor of the latest chamber to be pressurized, and Nadias curiosity got the best of her; she broke her customary silence on the topic, and asked Maya what was going on.Well, its John and Frank, Maya said querulously.Theyre very competitive.Theyre like brothers, and theres a lot of jealousy there.John got to Mars first, and then he got permission to come back again, and Frank doesnt think it was fair.Frank did a lot of the work in Washington to get the colony funded, and he thinks John has always taken advantage of his work.And now, well.John and I are good together, I like him.Its easy with him.Easy, but maybe a little ...I dont know.Not boring.But not exciting.He likes to walk around, hang out with the farm crew.He doesnt like to talk that much!Frank, now, we could talk forever.Argue forever, maybe, but at least were talking!And you know, we had a very brief affair on the Ares, back at the beginning, and it didnt work out, but he still thinks it could.Why would he think that?Nadia mouthed.So he keeps trying to talk me into leaving John and being with him, and John suspects thats what hes doing, so theres a lot of jealousy between them.Im just trying to keep them from each others throats, thats all.Nadia decided to stick to her resolve and not ask about it again.But now she was involved despite herself.Maya kept coming to her to talk, and to ask her to convey messages to Frank for her.Im not a go between!Nadia kept protesting, but she kept doing it, and once or twice when she did she got into long conversations with Frank, about Maya of course; who she was, what she was like, why she acted the way she did.Look, Nadia said to him, I cant speak for Maya.I dont know why she does what she does, you have to ask her yourself.But I can tell you, she comes out of the old Moscow Soviet culture, university and CP for both her mother and her grandmother.And men were the enemies for Mayas babushka, and for her mother too, it was a matrioshka.Mayas mother used to say to her, Women are the roots, men are just the leaves.There was a whole culture of mistrust, manipulation, fear.Thats where Maya comes from.And at the same time we have this tradition of amicochonstvo, a kind of intense friendship where you learn the very tiniest details of your friends life, you invade each others lives in a sense, and of course thats impossible and it has to end, usually badly.Frank was nodding at this description, recognizing something in it.Nadia sighed and went on.These are the friendships that lead to love, and then love has the same sort of trouble only magnified, especially with all that fear at the bottom of it.And Frank tall, dark, and somehow handsome, bulky with power, spinning with his own internal dynamo, the American politician, now wrapped around the finger of a neurotic Russian beauty Frank nodded humbly and thanked her, looking discouraged.As well he should.Nadia did her best to ignore all that.But it seemed everything else had turned problematic as well.Vlad had never approved of how much time they were spending on the surface in the daytime, and now he said, We ought to stay under the hill most of the time, and bury all the labs as well.Outdoors work should be restricted to an hour in the early mornings and another in the late afternoons, when the sun is low.Ill be damned if I stay indoors all day, Ann said, and many agreed with her.Weve got a lot of work to do, Frank pointed out.But most of it could be done by teleoperation, Vlad said.And it should be.What we are doing is the equivalent of standing ten kilometers from an atomic explosion  So?Ann said.Soldiers did that   every six months, Vlad finished, and stared at her.Would you do that?Even Ann looked subdued.No ozone layer, no magnetic field to speak of; they were getting fried by radiation almost as badly as if they were in interplanetary space, to the tune of 10 rems per year.And so Frank and Maya ordered them to ration their time outdoors.There was a lot of interior work to be done under the hill, getting the last row of chambers finished; and it was possible to dig some cellars below the vaults, giving them some more space protected from radiation.And many of the tractors were equipped to be teleoperated from indoor stations, their decision algorithms handling the details while the human operators watched screens below.So it could be done; but no one liked the life that resulted.Even Sax Russell, who was content to work indoors most of the time, looked a bit perplexed.In the evenings a number of people began to argue for immediate terraforming efforts, and they made the case with renewed intensity.Thats not our decision to make, Frank told them sharply.The U. N.  decides that one.Besides its a longterm solution, on the scale of centuries at best.Dont waste time talking about it!Ann said, Thats all true, but I dont want to waste my time down here in these caves, either.We should live our lives the way we want.Were too old to worry about radiation.Arguments again, arguments that made Nadia feel as if she had floated off the good solid rock of her planet back into the tense weightless reality of the Ares.Carping, complaining, arguing until people got bored, or tired, and went to sleep.Nadia started leaving the room whenever it began, looking for Hiroko and a chance to discuss something concrete.But it was hard to avoid these matters, to stop thinking about them.Then one night Maya came to her crying.There was room in the permanent habitat for private talks, and Nadia went with her down to the northeast corner of the vaults, where they were still working on interiors, and sat by her arm to arm, shivering and listening to her, and occasionally putting an arm over her shoulder and giving her a hug.Look, Nadia said at one point, why dont you just decide?Why dont you quit playing one off against the other?But I have decided!Its John I love, its always been John.But now hes seen me with Frank and he thinks Ive betrayed him.Its really petty of him!Theyre like brothers, they compete in everything, and this time its just a mistake!Nadia resisted learning the details, she didnt want to hear it.She sat there listening anyway.And then John was standing there before them.Nadia got up to leave, but he didnt appear to notice.Look, he said to Maya.Im sorry, but I cant help it.Its over.Its not over, Maya said, instantly composed.I love you.Johns smile was rueful.Yes.And I love you.But I want things simple.It is simple!No it isnt.I mean, you can be in love with more than one person at the same time.Anyone can, thats just the way it is.But you can only be loyal to one.And I want ...I want to be loyal.To someone who is loyal to me.Its simple, but ...He shook his head; he couldnt find the phrase.He walked back into the eastern row of chambers, disappeared through a door.Americans, Maya said viciously.Fucking children!Then she was up through the door after him.But soon she came back.He had retreated to a group in one of the lounges, and wouldnt leave.Im tired, Nadia tried to say, but Maya wouldnt hear it, she was getting more and more upset.For over an hour they discussed it, over and over.Eventually Nadia agreed to go to John and ask him to come to Maya and talk it over.Nadia walked grimly through the chambers, oblivious to the brick and the colorful nylon hangings.The go between that nobody noticed.Couldnt they get robots to do this?She found John, who apologized for ignoring her earlier.I was upset, Im sorry.I figured youd hear it all eventually anyway.Nadia shrugged.No problem.But look, you have to go talk to her.Thats the way it is with Maya.We talk, talk, talk; if you contract to be in a relationship, you have to talk your way all the way through it, and all the way out of it.If you dont it will be worse for you in the long run, believe me.That got to him.Sobered, he went off to find Maya.Nadia went to bed.The next day she was out working late on a trencher.It was the third job of the day, and the second had been trouble; Samantha had tried to carry a load on the earthmover blade while making a turn, and the thing had taken a nosedive and twisted the rods of the blade lifters out of their casings, spilling hydraulic fluid over the ground, where it had frozen before it even flattened out.They had had to set jacks under the airborne back end of the tractor, and then decouple the entire blade attachment and lower the vehicle on the jacks, and every step of the operation had been a pain.Then as soon as that was finished, Nadia had been called over to help with a Sandvik Tubex boring machine, which they were using to drill cased holes through large boulders they ran into while laying a water line from the alchemists to the permanent habitat.The down the hole pneumatic hammer had apparently frozen at full extension, as stuck as an arrow shot most of the way through a tree.Nadia stood looking down at the hammer shaft.Do you have any suggestions for freeing the hammer without breaking it?Spencer asked.Break the boulder, Nadia said wearily, and walked over and got in a tractor with a backhoe already attached.She drove it over, dug down to the top of the boulder, and then got out to attach a little Allied hydraulic impact hammer to the backhoe.She had just set it in position on the top of the boulder when the down the hole hammer suddenly jerked its drill back, pulling the boulder with it and catching the outside of her left hand against the underside of the Allied Hy Ram.Instinctively she pulled back, and pain lanced up her arm and into her chest.Fire filled that side of her body and her vision went white.There were shouts in her ears: Whats wrong?What happened?She must have screamed.Help, she grated.She was sitting, her crushed hand still pinned between rock and hammer.She pushed at the front wheel of the tractor with her foot, shoved with all her might and felt the hammer rasp her bones over rock.Then she was flopped on her back, the hand free.The pain was blinding, she felt sick to her stomach and thought she might faint.Pushing onto her knees with her good hand, she saw that the crushed hand was bleeding heavily, the glove ripped apart, the little finger apparently gone.She groaned and hunched over it, pressed it to her and then jammed it against the ground, ignoring the flash of pain.Even bleeding as it was, the hand would freeze in ...how long?Freeze, damn you, freeze, she cried.She shook tears out of her eyes and forced herself to look at it.Blood all over, steaming.She pushed the hand into the ground as hard as she could stand.Already it hurt less.Soon it would be numb, she would have to be careful not to freeze the whole hand!Frightened, she prepared to pull it back into her lap; then people were there, lifting her, and she fainted.After that she was maimed.Nadia Nine Fingers, Arkady called her over the phone.He sent her lines by Yevtushenko, written to mourn the death of Louis Armstrong: Do as you did in the past/And play.How did you find that?Nadia asked him.I cant imagine you reading Yevtushenko.Of course I read him, its better than McGonagall!No, this was in a book on Armstrong.Ive taken your advice and been listening to him while we work, and lately reading some books on him at night.I wish youd come down here, Nadia said.Vlad had done the surgery.He told her it would be all right.It caught you clean.The ring finger is a bit impaired, and will act like the little finger used to, probably.But ring fingers never do much anyway.The two main fingers will be strong as ever.Everyone came by to visit.Nevertheless she spoke more with Arkady than anyone else, in the hours of the night when she was alone, in the four and a half hours between Phoboss rising in the west and its setting in the east.He called in almost every night, at first, and often thereafter.Pretty soon she was up and around, hand in a cast that was suspiciously slender.She went out to troubleshoot or consult, hoping to keep her mind occupied.Michel Duval never came by at all, which she thought was strange.Wasnt this what psychologists were for?She couldnt help feeling depressed; she needed her hands for her work, she was a hand laborer.The cast got in the way and she cut off the part around the wrist, with shears from her tool kit.But she had to keep both hand and cast in a box when outside, and there wasnt much she could do.It really was depressing.Saturday night arrived, and she sat in the newly filled whirlpool bath, nursing a glass of bad wine and looking around at her companions, splashing and soaking in their bathing suits.She wasnt the only one to have been injured, by any means; they were all a bit battered now, after so many months of physical work.Almost everyone had frostburn marks, patches of black skin that eventually peeled, leaving pink new skin, garish and ugly in the heat of the pools.And several others wore casts, on hands, wrists, arms, even legs; all for breaks or sprains.Actually they were lucky no one had gotten killed yet.All these bodies, and none for her.They knew each other like family, she thought; they were each others physicians, they slept in the same rooms, dressed in the same locks, bathed together; an unremarkable group of human animals, eyecatching in the inert world they occupied, but more comforting than exciting, at least most of the time.Middle aged bodies.Nadia herself was as round as a pumpkin, a plump tough muscular short woman, squarish and yet rounded.And single.Her closest friend these days was only a voice in her ear, a face on the screen.When he came down from Phobos ...well, hard to say.He had had a lot of girlfriends on the Ares, and Janet Blyleven had gone to Phobos to be with him.People were arguing again, there in the shallows of the lap pool.Ann, tall and angular, leaning down to snap something at Sax Russell, short and soft.As usual, he didnt appear to be listening.She would hit him one day if he didnt watch out.It was strange how the group was changing again, how the feel of it was changing.She could never get a fix on it; the real nature of the group was a thing apart, with a life of its own, somehow distinct from the characters of the individuals that constituted it.It must make Michels job as their shrink almost impossible.Not that one could tell with Michel; he was the quietest and most unobtrusive psychiatrist she had ever met.No doubt an asset, in this crowd of shrink atheists.But she still thought it was odd he hadnt come by to see her after the accident.One evening she left the dining chambers and walked down to the tunnel they were digging from the vaulted chambers to the farm complex, and there at the tunnels end were Maya and Frank, arguing in a vicious undertone that carried down the tunnel not their meaning but their feeling Franks face was contorted with anger, and Maya as she turned from him was distraught, weeping; she turned back to shout at him, It was never like that, and then ran blindly toward Nadia, her mouth twisted into a snarl, Franks face a mask of pain.Maya saw Nadia standing there and ran right by her.Shocked, Nadia turned and walked back to the living chambers.She went up magnesium stairs to the living room in chamber two, and turned on the TV to watch a twenty four hour news program from Earth, something she very rarely did.After a while she turned down the sound, and looked at the pattern of bricks in the barrel vault overhead.Maya came in and started to explain things to her: there was nothing between her and Frank, it was in Franks mind only, he just wouldnt give up on it even though it had been nothing to begin with; she wanted only John, and it wasnt her fault that John and Frank were on such bad terms now, it was because of Franks irrational desire, it wasnt her fault, but she felt so guilty because the two men had once been such close friends, like brothers.And Nadia listened with a careful show of patience, saying Da, da, and I see, and the like, until Maya was lying flat on her back on the floor, crying, and Nadia was sitting on the edge of a chair staring at her, wondering how much of it was true.And what the argument had really been about.And whether she was a bad friend to distrust her old companions story so completely.But somehow the whole thing felt like Maya covering her tracks, practicing another manipulation.It was just this: those two distraught faces she had seen down the tunnel had been the clearest evidence possible of a fight between intimates.So Mayas explanation was almost certainly a lie.Nadia said something soothing to her and went off to bed, thinking, you already have taken too much of my time and energy and concentration with these games, you cost me a finger with them, you bitch!It was a new year, getting toward the end of the long northern spring, and they still had no good supply of water, so Ann proposed to make an expedition to the cap and set up a robot distillery, along the way establishing a route that rovers could follow on automatic pilot.Come with us, she said to Nadia.You havent seen anything of the planet yet, just the stretch between here and Chernobyl, and thats nothing.You missed Hebes and Ganges, and youre not doing anything new here.Really, Nadia, I cant believe what a grub youve been.I mean why did you come to Mars, after all?Why?Yes, why?I mean theres two kinds of activities here, theres the exploration of Mars and then theres the life support for that exploration.And here youve been completely immersed in the life support, without paying the slightest attention to the reason we came in the first place!Well, its what I like to do, Nadia said uneasily.Fine, but try to keep some perspective on it!What the hell, you could have stayed back on Earth and been a plumber!You didnt have to come all this way to drive a goddamn bulldozer!Just how long are you going to go on grubbing away here, installing toilets, programming tractors?All right, all right, Nadia said, thinking of Maya and all the rest.The square of vaults was almost finished, anyway.I could use a vacation.They took off in three big long range rovers: Nadia and five of the geologists, Ann, Simon Frazier, George Berkovic, Phyllis Boyle, and Edvard Perrin.George and Edvard were friends of Phylliss from their NASA days, and they supported her in advocating applied geological studies, meaning prospecting for rare metals.Simon on the other hand was a quiet ally of Anns, committed to pure research and a hands off attitude.Nadia knew all this even though she had spent very little time alone with any of these people, except for Ann.But talk was talk; she could have named all the allegiances of everyone at base if she had to.The expedition rovers were each composed of two four wheeled modules, coupled by a flexible frame; they looked a bit like giant ants.They had been built by Rolls Royce and a multinational aerospace consortium, and had a beautiful sea green finish.The forward modules contained the living quarters and had tinted windows on all four sides; the aft modules contained the fuel tanks, and sported a number of black rotating solar panels.The eight wire mesh wheels were two and a half meters high, and very broad.As they headed north across Lunae Planum they marked their route with little green transponders, dropping one every few kilometers.They also cleared rocks from their path that might disable a robot driven rover, using the snowplow attachment or the little crane at the front end of the first rover.So in effect they were building a road.But they seldom had to use the rock moving equipment on Lunae; they drove northeast at nearly their full speed of thirty kilometers an hour, for several days straight.They were heading northeast to avoid the canyon systems of Tempe and Mareotis, and this route took them down Lunae to the long slope of Chryse Planitia.Both these regions looked much like the land around their base camp, bumpy and strewn with small rocks, but because they were heading downhill they often had much longer views than they were used to.It was a new pleasure to Nadia, to drive on and on and see new countryside continually pop over the horizon: hillocks, dips, enormous isolated boulders, the occasional low round mesa that was the outside of a crater.When they had descended to the lowlands of the northern hemisphere, they turned and drove straight north across the immense Acidalia Planitia, and again ran straight for several days.Their wheel tracks stretched behind them like the first cut of a lawnmower through grass, and the transponders gleamed bright and incongruous among the rocks.Phyllis, Edvard and George talked about making a few side trips, to investigate some indications seen in satellite photos that there were unusual mineral outcroppings near Perepelkin Crater.Ann reminded them irritably of their mission.It made Nadia sad to see that Ann was nearly as distant and tense out here as she was back at base; whenever the rovers were stopped she was outside walking around alone, and she was withdrawn when they sat together in Rover One to eat dinner.Occasionally Nadia tried to draw her out: Ann, how did all these rocks get scattered around like this?Meteors.But where are the craters?Most are in the south.But how did the rocks get here, then?They flew.Thats why theyre so small.Its only smaller rocks could be tossed so far.But I thought you told me that these northern plains were relatively new, while the heavy cratering was relatively old.Thats right.The rocks you see here come from late meteor action.The total accumulation of loose rock from meteor strikes is much greater than what we can see, thats what gardened regolith is.And the regolith is a kilometer deep.Its hard to believe, Nadia said.I mean, thats so many meteors.Ann nodded.Its billions of years.Thats the difference between here and Earth, the age of the land goes from millions of years to billions.Its such a big difference its hard to imagine.But seeing stuff like this can help.Midway across Acidalia they began running into long, straight, steep walled, flat bottomed canyons.They looked, as George noted more than once, like the dry beds of the legendary canals.The geological name for them was fossae, and they came in clusters.Even the smallest of these canyons were impassable to rovers, and when they came on one they had to turn and run along its rim, until its floors rose or its walls drew together, and they could continue north over the flat plain again.The horizon ahead was sometimes twenty kilometers off, sometimes three.Craters became rare, and the ones they passed were surrounded by low mounds that rayed out from the rims splosh craters, where meteors had landed in permafrost that had turned to hot mud in the impact.Nadias companions spent a day wandering eagerly over the splayed hills around one of these craters.The rounded slopes, Phyllis said, indicated ancient water as clearly as the grain in petrified wood indicated the original tree.By the way she spoke Nadia understood that this was another of her disagreements with Ann; Phyllis believed in the long wet past model, Ann in the short wet past.Or something like that.Science was many things, Nadia thought, including a weapon with which to hit other scientists.Farther north, around latitude 54, they drove into the weird looking land of thermokarsts, hummocky terrain spotted by a great number of steep sided oval pits, called alases.These alases were a hundred times bigger than their Terran analogues, most of them two or three kilometers across, and about sixty meters deep.A sure sign of permafrost, the geologists all agreed; seasonal freezing and thawing of the soil caused it to slump in this pattern.Pits this big indicated that water content in the soil must have been high, Phyllis said.Unless it was yet another manifestation of Martian time scales, Ann replied.Slightly icy soil, slumping ever so slightly, for eons.Irritably Phyllis suggested that they try collecting water from the ground, and irritably Ann agreed.They found a smooth slope between depressions, and stopped to install a permafrost water collector.Nadia took charge of the operation with a feeling of relief; the trips lack of work had begun to get to her.It was a good days job: she dug a ten meter long trench with the lead rovers little backhoe; laid the lateral collector gallery, a perforated stainless steel pipe filled with gravel; checked the electric heating elements running in strips along the pipe and filters; then filled in the trench with the clay and rocks they had dug out earlier.Over the lower end of the gallery was a sump and pump, and an insulated transport line leading to a small holding tank.Batteries would power the heating elements, and solar panels charge the batteries.When the holding tank was full, if there was enough water to fill it, the pump would shut off and a solenoid valve would open, allowing the water in the transport line to drain back into the gallery, after which the heating elements would shut off as well.Almost done, Nadia declared late in the day, as she started to bolt the transport pipe onto the last magnesium post.Her hands were dangerously cold, and her maimed hand throbbed.Maybe someone could start dinner, she said.Im almost done here.The transport pipe had to be packed in a thick cylinder of white polyurethane foam, then fitted into a larger protective pipe.Amazing how insulation complicated a simple piece of plumbing.Hex nut, washer, cotter pin, a firm tug on the wrench.Nadia walked along the line, checking the coupling bands at the joints.Everything firm.She lugged her tools over to Rover One, looked back at the result of the days work: a tank, a short pipe on posts, a box on the ground, a long low mound of disturbed soil running uphill, looking raw but otherwise not unusual in this land of lumps.Well drink some fresh water on our way back, she said.They had driven north for over two thousand kilometers, and finally rolled down onto Vastitas Borealis, an ancient cratered lava plain that ringed the northern hemisphere between latitudes 60 and 70.Ann and the other geologists spent a couple of hours every morning out on the bare dark rock of this plain, taking samples, after which they would drive north for the rest of the day, discussing what they had found.Ann seemed more absorbed in the work, happier.One evening Simon pointed out that Phobos was running just over the low hills to the south; the next days drive would put it under the horizon.It was a remarkable demonstration of just how low the little moons orbit was they were only at latitude 69 !But Phobos was only some 5,000 kilometers above the planets equator.Nadia waved good bye to it with a smile, knowing she would still be able to talk to Arkady using the newly arrived areosynchronous radio satellites.Three days later the bare rock ended, running under waves of blackish sand.It was just like coming on the shore of a sea.They had reached the great northern dunes, which wrapped the world in a band between Vastitas and the polar cap; where they were going to cross, the band was about 800 kilometers wide.The sand was a charcoal color, tinged with purple and rose, a rich relief to the eye after all the red rubble of the south.The dunes trended north and south, in parallel crests that occasionally broke or merged.Driving over them was easy; the sand was hard packed, and they only had to pick a big dune and run along its humpbacked western side.After a few days of this, however, the dunes got bigger, and became what Ann called barchan dunes.These looked like huge frozen waves, with faces a hundred meters tall, and backs a kilometer wide, and the crescent that each wave made was several kilometers long.As with so many other Martian landscape features, they were a hundred times larger than their Terran analogues in the Sahara and Gobi.The expedition kept a level course over the backs of these great waves by contouring from one wave back to the next, their rovers like tiny boats, paddle wheeling over a black sea that had frozen at the height of a titanic storm.One day on this petrified sea, Rover Two stopped.A red light on the control panel indicated the problem was in the flexible frame between the modules; and in fact the rear module was tilted to the left, shoving the left side wheels into the sand.Nadia got into a suit and went back to have a look.She took the dust cover off the joint where the frame connected to the module chassis, and found that the bolts holding them together were all broken.This is going to take a while, Nadia said.You guys might as well have another look around.Soon the suited figures of Phyllis and George emerged, followed by Simon and Ann and Edvard.Phyllis and George took a transponder from Rover Three and set it out three meters to the right of their road.Nadia went to work on the broken frame, handling things as little as possible; it was a cold afternoon, perhaps seventy below, and she could feel the diamond chill right down to the bone.The ends of the bolts wouldnt come out of the side of the module, so she got out a drill and started drilling new holes.She began to hum The Sheik of Araby.Ann and Edvard and Simon were discussing sand.It was so nice, Nadia thought, to see ground that wasnt red.To hear Ann absorbed in her work.To have some work to do herself.They had almost reached the arctic circle, and it was Ls = 84, with the northern summer solstice only two weeks away; so the days were getting long.Nadia and George worked through the evening while Phyllis heated supper, and then after the meal Nadia went back out to finish the job.The sun was red in a brown haze, small and round even though it was near setting; there wasnt enough atmosphere for oblation to enlarge and flatten it.Nadia finished, put her tools away, and had opened the outer lock door of Rover One, when Anns voice spoke in her ear.Oh Nadia, are you going in already?Nadia looked up.Ann was on the ridge of the dune to the west, waving down at her, a black silhouette against a blood colored sky.That was the idea, Nadia said.Come on up here just a second.I want you to see this sunset, its going to be a good one.Come on, itll only take a minute, youll be glad you did it.There are clouds to the west.Nadia sighed and closed the outer lock door.The east face of the dune was steep.Nadia carefully stepped in the prints Ann had made in her ascent.The sand there was packed and held firm most of the time.Near the crest it got steeper, and she leaned forward and dug in with her fingers.Then she was clambering onto the broad rounded crest, and could straighten up and have a look around.Only the crests of the tallest dunes were still in sunlight; the world was a black surface, marred by short scimitar curves of steely gray.Horizon about five kilometers off.Ann was crouching, a scoop of sand in her palm.Whats it made of?Nadia asked.Dark solid mineral particles.Nadia snorted.I could have told you that.Not before we got here you couldnt.It might have been fines aggregated with salts.But its bits of rock instead.Why so dark?Volcanic.On Earth sand is mostly quartz, you see, because theres a lot of granite there.But Mars doesnt have much granite.These grains are probably volcanic silicates.Obsidian, flint, some garnet.Beautiful, isnt it?She held out a handful of sand for Nadias inspection.Perfectly serious of course.Nadia peered through her faceplate at the black grit.Beautiful, she said.They stood and watched the sun set.Their shadows went right out to the eastern horizon.The sky was a dark red, murky and opaque, only slightly lighter in the west over the sun.The clouds Ann had mentioned were bright yellow streaks, very high in the sky.Something in the sand caught at the light, and the dunes were distinctly purplish.The sun was a little gold button, and above it shone two evening stars: Venus, and the Earth.Theyve been getting closer every night lately, Ann said softly.The conjunction should be really brilliant.The sun touched the horizon, and the dune crests faded to shadow.The little button sun sank under the black line to the west.Now the sky was a maroon dome, the high clouds the pink of moss campion.Stars were popping out everywhere, and the maroon sky shifted to a vivid dark violet, an electric color that was picked up by the dune crests, so that it seemed crescents of liquid twilight lay across the black plain.Suddenly Nadia felt a breeze swirl through her nervous system, running up her spine and out into her skin; her cheeks tingled, and she could feel her spinal cord thrum.Beauty could make you shiver!It was a shock to feel such a physical response to beauty, a thrill like some kind of sex.And this beauty was so strange, so alien.Nadia had never seen it properly before, or never really felt it, she realized that now; she had been enjoying her life as if it were a Siberia made right, so that really she had been living in a huge analogy, understanding everything in terms of her past.But now she stood under a tall violet sky on the surface of a petrified black ocean, all new, all strange; it was absolutely impossible to compare it to anything she had seen before; and all of a sudden the past sheered away in her head and she turned in circles like a little girl trying to make herself dizzy, without a thought in her head.Weight seeped inward from her skin, and she didnt feel hollow anymore; on the contrary she felt extremely solid, compact, balanced.A little thinking boulder, set spinning like a top.They glissaded down the steep face of the dune on their boot heels.At the bottom Nadia gave Ann an impulsive hug: Oh Ann, I dont know how to thank you for that.Even through the tinted faceplates she could see Ann grin.A rare sight.After that things looked different to Nadia.Oh she knew it was in herself, that it was a matter of paying attention in a new way, of looking.But the landscape conspired in this sensation, feeding her new attentiveness; because the very next day they left the black dunes, and drove on to what her companions called layered or laminate terrain.This was the region of flat sand that in winter would lie under the CO2 skirt of the polar cap.Now in midsummer it lay revealed, a landscape made entirely of curvilinear patterns.They drove up broad flat washes of yellow sand that were bounded by long sinuous flat topped plateaus; the sides of the plateaus were stepped and benched, laminated both finely and grossly, looking like wood that had been cut and polished to show a handsome grain.None of them had ever seen any land remotely like it, and they spent the mornings taking samples and borings, and hiking around in a loping Martian ballet, talking a blue streak, Nadia as excited as any of them.Ann explained to her that each winters frost caught a lamina on the surface.Then wind erosion had cut arroyos, and stripped away at their sides, and each stratum was stripped back farther than the one below it, so that the arroyo walls consisted of hundreds of narrow terraces.Its like the land is a contour map of itself, Simon said.They drove during the days, and went out every evening, in purply dusks that lasted until just before midnight.They drilled borings, and came up with cores that were gritty and icy, laminated for as far down as they could drill.One evening Nadia was climbing with Ann up a series of parallel terraces, half listening to her explain about the precession of aphelion and perihelion, when she looked back across the arroyo and saw that it was glowing like lemons and apricots in the evening light, and that above the arroyo were pale green lenticular clouds, mimicking perfectly the terrains French curves.Look!she exclaimed.Ann looked back and saw it, and was still.They watched the low banded clouds float overhead.Finally a dinner call from the rovers brought them back.And walking down over the contoured terraces of sand, Nadia knew that she had changed that, or else the planet was getting much more strange and beautiful as they traveled north.Or both.They rolled over flat terraces of yellow sand, sand so fine and hard and clear of rocks that they could go at full speed, slowing down only to shift up or down from one bench to another.Occasionally the rounded slope between terraces gave them some trouble, and once or twice they even had to backtrack to find a way.But usually a route north could be found without difficulty.On their fourth day in the laminate terrain, the plateau walls flanking their flat wash curved together, and they drove up the cleavage onto a higher plane; and there before them on the new horizon was a white hill, a great rounded thing, like a white Ayers Rock.A white hill it was ice!A hill of ice, a hundred meters high and a kilometer wide and when they drove around it, they saw that it continued over the horizon to the north.It was the tip of a glacier, perhaps a tongue of the polar cap itself.In the other cars they were shouting, and in the noise and confusion Nadia could only hear Phyllis, crying Water!Water!Water indeed.Though they had known it was going to be there, it was still startling in the extreme to run into a whole great white hill of it, in fact the tallest hill they had seen in the entire 5,000 kilometers of their voyage.It took them all that first day to get used to it: they stopped the rovers, pointed, chattered, got out to have a look, took surface samples and borings, touched it, climbed up it a ways.Like the sand around it, the ice hill was horizontally laminated, with lines of dust about a centimeter apart.Between the lines the ice was pocked and granular; in this atmospheric pressure it sublimed at almost all temperatures, leaving pitted, rotten side walls to a depth of a few centimeters; under that it was solid, and hard.This is a lot of water, they all said at one point or another.Water, on the surface of Mars.The next day the glacier hill formed their right horizon, a wall that ran on beside them for the whole days drive.Then it really began to seem like a lot of water, especially as over the course of the day the wall got taller, rising to a height of about 300 meters.A kind of white mountain ridge, in fact, walling off their flat bottomed valley on its east side.And then, over the horizon to the northwest, there appeared another white hill, the top of another ridge poking over the horizon, the base remaining beneath it.Another glacier hill, walling them in to the west, some thirty kilometers away.So they were in Chasma Borealis, a wind carved valley that cut north into the ice cap for some 500 kilometers, more than half the distance to the Pole.The chasms floor was flat sand, hard as concrete, and often crunchy with a layer of CO2 frost.The chasms ice walls were tall, but not vertical; they lay back at an angle less than forty five degrees, and like the hillsides in the laminate terrain, they were terraced, the terraces ragged with wind erosion and sublimation, the two forces that over tens of thousands of years had cut the whole length of the chasm.Rather than driving up to the head of the valley, the explorers crossed to the western wall, aiming toward a transponder that had been included in a drop of ice mining equipment.The sand dunes mid chasm were low and regular, and the rovers rolled over the corrugated land, up and down, up and down.Then as they crested a sand wave they spotted the drop, no more than two kilometers from the foot of the northwest ice wall: bulky lime green containers on skeletal landing modules, a strange sight in this world of whites and tans and pinks.What an eyesore!Ann exclaimed, but Phyllis and George were cheering.During the long afternoon, the shadowed western ice side took on a variety of pale colors: the purest water ice was clear and bluish, but most of the hillside was a translucent ivory, copiously tinted by pink and yellow dust.Irregular patches of CO2 ice were a bright pure white; the contrast between dry ice and water ice was vivid, and made it impossible to read the actual contours of the hillside.And foreshortening made it hard to tell how tall the hill really was; it seemed to go up forever, and was probably somewhere between three and five hundred meters above the floor of Borealis.This is a lot of water, Nadia exclaimed.And theres more underground, Phyllis said.Our borings show that the cap actually extends many degrees of latitude farther south than we see, buried under the layered terrain.So we have more water than well ever need!Ann pursed her mouth unhappily.The drop of the mining equipment had determined the site of the ice mining camp: the west wall of Chasma Borealis, at longitude 41, latitude 83 N.  Deimos had just recently followed Phobos under the horizon; they wouldnt see it again until they returned south of 82 N.  The summer nights consisted of an hours purple twilight; the rest of the time the sun wheeled around, never more than twenty degrees above the horizon.The six of them spent long hours outside, moving the ice miner to the wall and then setting it up.The main component was a robotic tunnel borer, about the size of one of their rovers.The borer cut into the ice, and passed back cylindrical drums one and a half meters in diameter.When they turned the borer on it made a loud, low buzz, which was louder still if they put their helmets to the ice, or even touched it with their hands.After a while white ice drums thumped into a hopper, and then a small robot forklift carried them to a distillery, which would melt the ice and separate out its considerable load of dust, then refreeze the water into one meter cubes more suitable for packing in the holds of the rovers.Robot freight rovers would then be perfectly capable of driving to the site, loading up and returning to base on their own, and base would then have a regular water supply, larger than they could ever use.Around four or five million cubic kilometers in the visible polar cap, Edvard calculated, though there were a lot of guesses in the calculation.They spent several days testing the miner, and deploying an array of solar panels to power it.In the long evenings after dinner Ann would climb the ice wall, ostensibly to take more borings, although Nadia knew she just wanted away from Phyllis and Edvard and George.And naturally she wanted to climb all the way to the top, to get on the polar cap and look around, and take borings of the most recent layers of ice.So one day when the miner had passed all the test routines, she and Nadia and Simon got up at dawn just after two a. m.  and went out into the supercold morning air and climbed, their shadows like big spiders climbing before them.The slope of the ice was about thirty degrees, steepening and then letting off time after time as they ascended the rough benches in the hills layered side.It was seven a. m.  when the slope lay back and they walked onto the surface of the polar cap.To the north was a plain of ice that extended as far as they could see, to a high horizon some thirty kilometers away.Looking back to the south they could see a great distance over the geometric swirls of the layered terrain; it was the longest view Nadia had ever had on Mars.The ice of the plateau was layered much like the laminated sand below them, with wide bands of dirty pink contouring across cleaner stuff.The other wall of Chasma Borealis lay off to the east, looking almost vertical from their point of view, long, tall, massive: So much water!Nadia said again.Its more than well ever need.That depends, Ann said absently, screwing the frame of the little borer into the ice.Her darkened faceplate turned up at Nadia.If the terraformers have their way, this will all go like dew on a hot morning.Into the air to make pretty clouds.Would that be so bad?Nadia asked.Ann stared at her.Through the tinted faceplate her eyes looked like ball bearings.That night at dinner she said, We really ought to make a run up to the pole.Phyllis shook her head.We dont have the food or air.Call for a drop.Edvard shook his head.The polar cap is cut by valleys almost as deep as Borealis!Not so, Ann said.You could drive straight to it.The swirl valleys look dramatic from space, but thats because of the difference in albedo between the water and the CO2.The actual slopes are never more than six degrees off the horizontal.Its just more layered terrain, really.George said, But what about getting onto the cap in the first place?We drive around to one of the tongues of ice that drop to the sand.Theyre like ramps up to the central massif, and once there, we drive right to the pole!Theres no reason to go, Phyllis said.Itll just be more of what we see here.And it means more exposure to radiation.And, George added, we could use what food and air we do have to check out some of the sites we passed on the way up here.So that was their point.Ann scowled.Im the head of the geological survey, she said sharply.Which may have been true, but she was a horrible politician, especially compared to Phyllis, who had any number of friends in Houston and Washington.But theres no geological reason to go to the pole, Phyllis said now with a smile.Itll be the same ice as here.You just want to go.Well?Ann said.Say I do!There are still scientific questions to be answered up there.Is the ice the same composition, how much dust everywhere we go up here we collect valuable data.But were up here to get water.Were not up here to fool around.Its not fooling around!Ann snapped.We obtain water to allow us to explore, we dont explore just to obtain water!Youve got it backwards!I cant believe how many people in this colony do that!Nadia said, Lets see what they say at base.They might want us to help with something there, or they might not be able to send a drop, you never know.Ann groaned.Well end up asking permission from the U. N. , I swear.She was right.Frank and Maya didnt like the idea, John was interested but noncommittal.Arkady supported it when he heard of it, and declared he would send a supply drop from Phobos if necessary, which given its orbit was impractical at best.But at that point Maya called Mission Control in Houston and Baikonur, and the argument rippled outward.Hastings opposed the plan, but Baikonur, and a lot of the scientific community, liked it.Finally Ann got on the phone, her voice very curt and arrogant, though she looked scared.Im the geological head here, and I say it needs to be done.There wont be any better opportunity to get onsite data on the original condition of the polar cap.Its a delicate system, and any change in the atmosphere is going to impact it heavily.And youve got plans to do that, right?Sax, are you still working on those windmill heaters?Sax had not been part of the discussion, and he had to be called to the phone.Sure, he said when the question was repeated.He and Hiroko had come up with the idea of manufacturing small windmills, to be dropped from dirigibles all over the planet.The constant westerlies would spin the windmills, and the spin would be converted to heat in coils in the base of the mills, and this heat would simply be released into the atmosphere.Sax had already designed a robotic factory to manufacture the windmills; he hoped to make them by the thousands.Vlad pointed out that the heat gained would come at the price of winds slowed down you couldnt get something for nothing.Sax immediately argued that that would be a side benefit, given the severity of the global dust storms the wind sometimes caused.A little heat for a little wind is a great trade off.So, a million windmills, Ann said now.And thats just the start.You talked about spreading black dust on the polar caps, didnt you, Sax?It would thicken the atmosphere faster than practically any other action we could take.So if you get your way, Ann said, the caps are doomed.Theyll evaporate and then were going to say, I wonder what they were like?And we wont know.Do you have enough supplies, enough time?John asked.Well drop you supplies, Arkady said again.Theres four more months of summer, Ann said.You just want to go to the pole!Frank said, echoing Phyllis.So?Ann replied.You may have come here to play office politics, but I plan to see a bit of this place.Nadia grimaced.That ended that line of conversation, and Frank would be angry.Which was never a good idea.Ann, Ann....The next day the Terran offices weighed in with the opinion that the polar cap ought to be sampled in its aboriginal condition.No objections from base, though Frank did not get back on the line.Simon and Nadia cheered: North to the Pole!Phyllis just shook her head.I dont see the point.George and Edvard and I will stay down here as a back up, and make sure the ice miner is working right.So Ann and Nadia and Simon took Rover Three and drove back down Chasma Borealis and around to the west, where one of the glaciers curling away from the cap thinned to a perfect rampway.The mesh of the rovers big wheels caught like a snowmobiles drivetrain, running well over all the various surfaces of the cap, over patches of exposed granular dust, low hills of hard ice, fields of blinding white CO2 frost, and the usual lace of sublimed water ice.Shallow valleys swirled outward in a clockwise pattern from the pole; some of these were very broad.Crossing these they would drive down a bumpy slope that curved away to right and left over both horizons, all of it covered by bright dry ice; this could last for twenty kilometers, until the whole visible world was bright white.Then before them a rising slope of the more familiar dirty red water ice would appear, striated by contour lines.As they crossed the bottom of the trough the world would be divided in two, white behind, dirty pink ahead.Driving up the south facing slopes, they found the water ice more rotten than elsewhere, but as Ann pointed out, every winter a meter of dry ice sat on the permanent cap to crush the previous summers rotten filigree, so the potholes were filled on an annual schedule; and the rovers big wheels crunched cleanly along.Beyond the swirl valleys they found themselves on a smooth white plain, extending to the horizon in every direction.Behind the polarized and tinted glass of the rovers windows the whiteness was unmarred and pure.Once they passed a low ring hill, the mark of some relatively recent meteor impact, filled in by subsequent ice deposition.They stopped to take borings, of course.Nadia had to restrict Ann and Simon to four borings a day, to save time and keep the rovers trunks from being overloaded.And it wasnt just borings: often they would pass black isolated rocks, resting on the ice like Magritte sculptures meteorites.They collected the smallest of these and took samples from the larger ones, and once passed one that was as big as the rover.They were nickel iron for the most part, or stony chondrites.Chipping away at one of these, Ann said to Nadia, You know theyve found meteorites on Earth that came from Mars.The reverse happens too, although much less often.It takes a really big impact to jack rocks out of Earths gravitational field fast enough to get them out here delta V of fifteen kilometers per second, at least.Ive heard it said that about two percent of the material ejected out of Earths field would end up on Mars.But only from the biggest impacts, like the KT boundary impact.It would be strange to find a chunk of the Yucatan here, wouldnt it?But that was sixty million years ago, Nadia said.It would be buried under the ice.True.Later, walking back to the rover, she said, Well, if they melt these caps then well find some.Well have a whole museum of meteorites, sitting around on the sand.They crossed more swirl valleys, falling again into the up and down pattern of a boat over waves, this time the largest waves yet, forty kilometers from crest to crest.They used the clocks to keep on a schedule, and parked from ten p. m.  to five a. m.  on hillocks or buried crater rims, to give themselves a view during their stops; and they blacked the windows with double polarization to help them to get some sleep at night.Then one morning as they crunched along, Ann turned on the radio and began to run GPS checks with the areosynchronous satellites.Its not easy to find the pole, she said as she worked.The early Terran explorers had a hell of a time in the north, they were always up there in summertime and couldnt see the stars, and they had no satellite checks.So how did they do it?Nadia asked, suddenly curious.Ann thought about it and smiled.I dont know.Not very well, I suspect.Probably dead reckoning.Nadia became intrigued by the problem, and started working on it on a sketchpad.Geometry had never been her strong point, but presumably at the north pole on midsummers day, the sun would inscribe a perfect circle around the horizon, never getting higher or lower.If you were near the Pole, then, and it was near midsummers day, you might be able to use a sextant to make timed checks on the suns height above the horizon....Was that right?This is it, Ann said.What?They stopped the rover, looked around.The white plain undulated to the nearby horizon, featureless except for a couple of broad red contour lines.The lines did not form bulls eye circles around them, and it didnt look like they were at the top of anything.Where, exactly?Nadia asked.Well, somewhere just north of here.Ann smiled again.Within a kilometer or so.Maybe that way.She pointed off to the right.Well have to go over there a ways and check with the satellite again.A little bit of simple GPS and we should be able to hit it on the nose.Plus or minus a meter, anyway.If we just took the time, we could make it plus or minus a centimeter!Simon said enthusiastically.Lets pin it down!So they drove for a minute, consulted the radio, turned to right angles and drove again, made another consultation.Finally Ann declared they were there, or close enough.Simon instructed the computer to keep working on it, and they suited up and went out and wandered around a bit, to make sure they had stepped on it.Ann and Simon drilled a boring.Nadia kept walking, in a spiral that expanded away from the car.A reddish white plain, the horizon some four kilometers away; too close; it came to her in a rush, as during the black dune sunset, that this was alien a sharp awareness of the tight horizon, the dreamy gravity, a world just so big and no bigger ...and now she was standing right on its north pole.It was L8 = 92, about as near midsummer as you could ask, so if she stood facing the sun, and didnt move, the sun would stay level and circle around her for all the rest of the day, or the rest of the week for that matter!It was strange.She was spinning like a top.If she stood still long enough, would she feel it?Her polarized faceplate reduced the suns glare on the ice to an arc of crystalline rainbow points.It wasnt very cold.She could just feel a breeze against her upraised palm.A graceful red streak of depositional laminae ran over the horizon like a longitude line.She laughed at the thought.There was a very faint ice ring around the sun, big enough that its lower arc just touched the horizon.Ice was subliming off the polar cap and gleaming in the air above, providing the crystals in the ring.Grinning, she stomped her boot prints into the north pole of Mars.That evening they aligned the polarizers so that a very dimmed down image of the white desert stood around them in the module windows.Nadia sat back with an empty food tray in her lap, sipping a cup of coffee.The digital clock flicked from 11:59:59 to 0:00:00, and stopped.Its stillness accentuated the quietness in the car.Simon was asleep; Ann sat in the drivers seat, staring out at the scene, her dinner half eaten.No sound but the whoosh of the ventilator.Im glad you got us up here, Nadia said.Its been great.Someone should enjoy it, Ann said.When she was angry or bitter her voice became flat and distant, almost as if she were being matter of fact.It wont be here long.Are you sure, Ann?Its five kilometers deep here, isnt that what you said?Do you really think it will completely disappear just because of black dust on it?Ann shrugged.Its a question of how warm we make it.And of how much total water there is on the planet, and how much of the water in the regolith will surface when we heat the atmosphere.We wont know any of those things until they happen.But I suspect that since this cap is the primary exposed body of water, itll be the most sensitive to change.It could sublime away almost entirely before any significant part of the permafrost has gotten within fifty degrees of melting.Entirely?Oh, some will be deposited every winter, sure.But theres not that much water, when you put it in the global perspective.This is a dry world, the atmosphere is superarid, it makes Antarctica look like a jungle, and remember how that place used to suck us dry?So if temperatures go up high enough, the ice will sublime at a really rapid rate.This whole cap will shift into the atmosphere and blow south, where itll frost out at nights.So in effect itll be redistributed more or less evenly over the whole planet, as frost about a centimeter thick.She grimaced.Less than that, of course, because most of it will stay in the air.But then if it gets hotter still, the frost will melt, and it will rain.Then weve got rivers and lakes, right?If the atmospheric pressure is high enough.Liquid surface water depends on air pressure as well as temperature.If both rise, we could be walking around on sand here in a matter of decades.Itd be quite a meteorite collection, Nadia said, trying to lighten Anns mood.It didnt work.Ann pursed her lips, stared out the window, shook her head.Her face could be so bleak; it couldnt be explained entirely by Mars, there had to be something more to it, something that explained that intense internal spin, that anger.Bessie Smith land.It was hard to watch.When Maya was unhappy it was like Ella Fitzgerald singing a blues, you knew it was a put on, the exuberance just poured through it.But when Ann was unhappy, it hurt to watch it.Now she picked up her dish of lasagna, leaned back to stick it in the microwave.Beyond her the white waste gleamed under a black sky, as if the world outside were a photo negative.The clockface suddenly read 0:00:01.Four days later they were off the ice.As they retraced their route back to Phyllis and George and Edvard, the three travelers rolled over a rise and came to a halt.There was a structure on the horizon.Out on the flat sediment of the chasma floor there stood a classical Greek temple, six Dorian columns of white marble, capped by a round flat roof.What the hell?When they got closer they saw that the columns were made of ice drums from the miner, stacked on top of each other.The disk that served as roof was rough hewn.Georges idea, Phyllis said over the radio.I noticed the ice cylinders were the same size as the marble drums the Greeks used for their pillars, George said, still pleased with himself.After that it was obvious.And the miner is running perfectly, so we had some time to kill.It looks great, Simon said.And it did: alien monument, dream visitation, it glowed like flesh in the long dusk, as if blood ran under its ice.A temple to Ares.To Neptune, corrected George.We dont want to invoke Ares too often, I dont think.Especially given the crowd at base camp, Ann said.As they drove south their road of tracks and transponders ran ahead of them, as distinct as any highway of paved concrete.It did not take Ann to point out how much this changed the feel of their travel; they were no longer exploring untouched land, and the nature of the landscape itself was altered, split left and right by the parallel lines of crosshatched wheel tracks, and by the green canisters slightly dimmed by a rime of dust, all marking the way.It wasnt wilderness anymore; that was the point of road building, after all.They could leave the driving to Rover Three automatic pilot, and often did.So they were trundling along at thirty kph, with nothing to do but look at the bisected view, or talk, which they did infrequently, except on the morning they got into a heated discussion about Frank Chalmers Ann maintaining that he was a complete Machiavellian, Phyllis insisting that he was no worse than anyone else in power, and Nadia, remembering her talks with him about Maya, knowing it was more complex than either of those views.But it was Anns lack of discretion that appalled her, and as Phyllis went on about how Frank had held them together in the last months of the voyage out, Nadia glared at Ann, trying to convey to her by looks that she was talking in the wrong crowd.Phyllis would use her indiscretions against her later on, that was obvious.But Ann was bad at seeing looks.Then suddenly the rover braked and slowed to a stop.No one had been watching, and they all jumped to the front window.There before them was a flat white sheet, covering their road for nearly a hundred meters.What is it?George cried.Our permafrost pump, Nadia said, pointing.It must have broken.Or worked too well!Simon said.Thats water ice!They switched the rover to manual, drove nearer.The spill covered the road like a wash of white lava.They struggled into their walkers and got out of the module, walked over to the edge of the spill.Our own ice rink, Nadia said, and went to the pump.She unhooked the insulation pad and had a look inside.Ah ha a gap in the insulation water froze right here, and jammed the stopcock in the open position.A good head of pressure, Id say.Ran till it froze thick enough to stop it.A tap from a hammer might get us our own little geyser.She went to her tool cabinet in the underside of the module, took out a pick.Watch out!She struck a single blow at the white mass of ice, where the pump joined the tank feeder pipe.A thick bolt of water squirted a meter into the air.Wow!It splashed down onto the white sheet of ice, steaming even though it froze within seconds, making a white lobate leaf on top of the ice already there.Look at that!The hole too froze over, and the stream of water stopped, and the steam blew away.Look how fast it froze!Looks just like those splosh craters, Nadia remarked, grinning.It had been a beautiful sight, water spilling out and steaming like mad as it froze.Nadia chipped away at the ice around the stopvalve while Ann and Phyllis argued about migration of permafrost and quantities of water at this latitude, etc.etc.One would think theyd get sick of it.But they really did dislike each other, and so they were helpless to stop.It would be the last trip they ever took together, no doubt about it.Nadia herself would be disinclined to travel with Phyllis and George and Edvard anymore, they were too complacent, too much a little in group of their own.But Ann was alienated from quite a few other people as well; if she didnt watch out, shed be without anyone at all to accompany her on trips.Frank, for instance that comment to him the other night, and then telling Phyllis of all people how horrible he was incredible.And if she alienated everyone but Simon, she would be hurting for conversation, for Simon Frazier was the quietest man in the whole hundred.He had hardly said twenty sentences the entire length of the trip, it was uncanny, like traveling with a deaf mute.Except maybe he talked to Ann when they were alone, who knew?Nadia worked the valve into its stop position, then shut the whole pump down.Well have to use thicker insulation this far north, she said to no one in particular as she took her tools back to the rover.She was tired of all the sniping, anxious to get back to base camp and her work.She wanted to talk with Arkady; he would make her laugh.And without trying, or even knowing exactly how, she would make him laugh too.They put a few chunks of the ice spill in among the rest of the samples, and set out four transponders to guide robot pilots around the spill.Although it may sublime away, right?Nadia said.Ann, lost in thought, didnt hear the question.Theres a lot of water up here, she muttered to herself, sounding worried.Youre damned right there is, Phyllis exclaimed.Now why dont we have a look at those deposits weve spotted at the north end of Mareotis?As they got closer to base Ann became more closemouthed and solitary, her face held tight as a mask.Whats the matter?Nadia asked one evening, when they were out together near sunset, fixing a defective transponder.I dont want to go back, Ann said.She was kneeling by an isolated rock, chipping at it.I dont want this trip to end.Id like to keep traveling all the time, down into the canyons, up to the volcano rims, into the chaos and the mountains around Hellas.I dont ever want to stop.She sighed.But ...Im part of the team.So I have to climb back into the hovel with everyone else.Is it really that bad?Nadia said, thinking of her beautiful barrel vaults, of the steaming whirlpool bath and a glass of icy vodka.You know it is!Twenty four and a half hours a day, underground in those little rooms, with Maya and Frank running their political schemes, and Arkady and Phyllis fighting over everything, which I understand now, believe me and George complaining and John floating in a fog and Hiroko obsessed by her little empire Vlad too, Sax too....I mean, what a crowd!Theyre no worse than any other.No worse and no better.You have to get along.You couldnt be here all by yourself.No.But it feels like Im not here anyway, when Im at the base.Might as well be back on the ship!No, no, Nadia said.Youre forgetting.She kicked the rock Ann was working on, and Ann looked up in surprise.You can kick rocks, see?Were here, Ann.Here on Mars, standing on it.And every day you can go out and run around.And youll be taking as many trips as anyone, with your position.Ann looked away.It just doesnt seem like enough, sometimes.Nadia stared at her.Well.Ann.Its radiation keeping us underground more than anything.What youre saying in effect is that you want the radiation to go away.Which means thickening the atmosphere, which means terraforming.I know.Her voice was tight, so tight that suddenly the careful matter of fact tone was lost and forgotten.Dont you think I know?She stood and waved the hammer.But it isnt right!I mean I look at this land and, and I love it.I want to be out on it traveling over it always, to study it and live on it and learn it.But when I do that, I change it I destroy what it is, what I love in it.This road we made, it hurts me to see it!And base camp is like an open pit mine, in the middle of a desert never touched since time began.So ugly, so I dont want to do that to all of Mars, Nadia, I dont.Id rather die.Let the planet be, leave it wilderness and let radiation do what it will.Its only a statistical matter anyway, I mean if it raises my chance of cancer to one in ten, then nine times out of ten Im all right!Fine for you, Nadia said.Or for any individual.But for the group, for all the living things here the genetic damage, you know.Over time it would cripple us.So, you know, you cant just think of yourself.Part of a team, Ann said dully.Well, you are.I know.She sighed.Well all say that.Well all go on and make the place safe.Roads, cities.New sky, new soil.Until its all some kind of Siberia or Northwest Territories, and Mars will be gone and well be here, and well wonder why we feel so empty.Why when we look at the land we can never see anything but our own faces.On the sixty second day of their expedition they saw plumes of smoke over the southern horizon, strands of brown, gray, white and black rising and mixing, billowing into a flat topped mushroom cloud that wisped off to the east.Home again home again, Phyllis said cheerily.Their tracks from the trip out, half filled by dust, led them back toward the smoke: through the freight landing zone, across ground crisscrossed with treadmarks, across ground trampled to light red sand, past ditches and mounds, pits and piles, and finally to the great raw mound of the permanent habitat, a square earthen redoubt now topped by a silvery network of magnesium beams.That sight piqued Nadias interest, but as they rolled on in she could not help noticing the litter of frames, crates, tractors, cranes, spare part dumps, garbage dumps, windmills, solar panels, water towers, concrete roads leading east, west and south, air miners, the low buildings of the alchemists quarter, their smokestacks emitting the plumes they had seen; the stacks of glass, the round cones of gray gravel, the big mounds of raw regolith next to the cement factory, the small mounds of regolith scattered everywhere else.It had the disordered, functional, ugly look of Chelyabinsk 65 or any of the rest of the other Stalinist heavy industry cities in the Urals, or the oil camps of Yakut.They rolled through a good five kilometers of this devastation, and as they did Nadia did not dare to look at Ann, who sat silently beside her, emanating disgust and loathing.Nadia too was shocked, and surprised at the change in herself; this had all seemed perfectly normal before the trip, indeed had pleased her very much.Now she was slightly nauseated, and afraid Ann might do something violent, especially if Phyllis said anything more.But Phyllis kept her mouth shut, and they rolled into the tractor lot outside the northern garage and stopped.The expedition was over.One by one they plugged the rovers into the wall of the garage and crawled through the doors.Familiar faces crowded around, Maya and Frank and Michel and Sax and John and Ursula and Spencer and Hiroko and all the rest, like brothers and sisters really, but so many of them that Nadia was overwhelmed, she shriveled like a touched anemone, and had trouble talking.She wanted to grasp something she could feel escaping her, she looked around for Ann and Simon, but they were trapped by another group and seemed stunned, Ann stoical, a mask of herself.Phyllis told their story for them.It was nice, really spectacular, the sun shone all the time, and the ice is really there, weve got access to a lot of water, its like the Arctic when youre up on that polar cap....Did you find any phosphorus?Hiroko asked.Wonderful to see Hirokos face, worried about the shortage of phosphorus for her plants.Ann told her that she had found drifts of sulphates in the light material around the craters in Acidalia, so they went off together to look at the samples.Nadia followed the others down the concrete walled underground passageway to the permanent habitat, thinking about a real shower and fresh vegetables, half listening to Maya give her the latest news.She was home.Back to work; and as before, it was unrelenting and many faceted, an endless list of things to do, and never enough time, because even though some tasks took much less human time than Nadia had expected, being robot adequate, everything else took much more.And none of it gave her the same joy as building the barrel vault chambers had, even if it was interesting in the technical sense.If they wanted the central square under the dome to be of any use, they had to lay a foundation that from bottom to top was composed of gravel, concrete, gravel, fiberglass, regolith, and finally treated soil.The dome itself would be made of double panes of thick treated glass, to hold the pressure and to cut down on UV rays, and a certain percentage of cosmic radiation.When all of it was done, they would have a central garden atrium of 10,000 square meters, really quite an elegant and satisfying plan.But as Nadia worked on the various aspects of the structure she found her mind wandering, her stomach tense.Maya and Frank were no longer speaking to one another in their official capacities, which indicated that their private relationship was going poorly indeed; and Frank did not seem to want to talk to John either, which was a shame.The broken affair between Sasha and Yeli had turned into a kind of civil war between their friends, and Hirokos band, Iwao and Paul and Ellen and Rya and Gene and Evgenia and the rest, perhaps in reaction to all this, spent every day out in the atrium or in the greenhouses, living together out there, more withdrawn than ever.Vlad and Ursula and the rest of the medical team were absorbed in research almost to the exclusion of clinical work with the colonists, which made Frank furious, and the genetic engineers spent all their time out in the converted trailer park, in the labs.And yet Michel was behaving as if nothing were abnormal, as if he were not the psychological officer for the colony.He spent a lot of time watching French TV.When Nadia asked him about Frank and John, he only looked blankly at her.They had been on Mars for 420 days, and the first seconds of their universe were past.They no longer gathered to plot the next days work, or discuss what they were doing.Too busy, people said to Nadia when she asked.Well, its too involved to describe, you know, itd put you to sleep.It does me.And so on.And then at odd moments she would see in her minds eye the black dunes, the white ice, the silhouetted figures against a sunset sky.She would shiver and come to with a sigh.Ann had already arranged another trip and was gone, this time south to the northernmost arms of great Valles Marineris, to see more unimaginable marvels.But Nadia was needed at base camp, whether she wanted to be out with Ann in the canyons or not.Maya complained about how much Ann was away.Its clear she and Simon have started something and are just out there having a honeymoon while we slave away in here.That was Mayas way of looking at things, that would be what it would take to make Maya as happy as Ann sounded in her calls.But Ann was in the canyons, and that was all that was needed to make her sound that way.If she and Simon had started something it would only be a natural extension of that, and Nadia hoped it was true, she knew that Simon loved Ann, and she had felt the presence of an immense solitude in Ann, something that needed a human contact.If only she could join them again!But she had to work.So she worked, she bossed people around the construction sites, she stalked the building sites and snapped at her friends sloppy work.Her injured hand had regained some strength during the trip, so she was able to drive tractors and bulldozers again; she spent long days doing that, but it just wasnt the same anymore.At Ls = 208 Arkady came down to Mars for the first time.Nadia went out to the new spaceport and stood on the edge of the broad expanse of dusty cement to watch the arrival, hopping from foot to foot.The burnt sienna cement was already marked by the yellow and black stains of earlier landings.Arkadys pod appeared in the pink sky, a white dot and then a yellow flame like an inverted gas burnoff stack.Eventually it resolved into a geodesic hemisphere with rockets and legs below, drifting down on a column of fire, and landing with unearthly delicacy right on the centerpoint dot.Arkady had been working on the descent program, apparently with good results.He climbed out of the landers hatch about twenty minutes later, and stood upright on the top step, looking around.He descended the staircase confidently, and once on the ground bounced experimentally on the tips of his toes, took a few steps, then spun around, arms wide.Nadia had a sudden sharp memory of how it had felt, that hollow sensation.Then he fell over.She hurried over to him, and he saw her and stood and made straight for her and tripped again across the rough Portland cement.She helped pull him back to his feet, and they met in a hug and staggered, him in a big pressurized suit, her in a walker.His hairy face looked shockingly real through their faceplates; the video had made her forget the third dimension and all the rest that made reality so vivid, so real.He banged his faceplate lightly against hers, grinning his wild grin.She could feel the stretch of a similar smile on her face.He pointed at his wrist console and switched to their private band, 4224, and she did the same.Welcome to Mars.Alex and Janet and Roger had come down with Arkady, and when they were all out of the lander they climbed into the open carriage of one of the Model Ts, and Nadia drove them back to base, over the wide paved road at first, and then shortcutting through the Alchemists Quarter.She told them about each building they passed, aware that they already recognized them all.Suddenly she was nervous, remembering what it had looked like to her after the trip to the pole.They stopped at the garage lock and she led them inside.There it was another family reunion.Later that day Nadia led Arkady around the square of vaulted chambers, through door after door, room after furnished room, all twenty four of them, and then out into the atrium.The sky was a ruby color through the glass panels, and the magnesium struts gleamed like tarnished silver.Well?Nadia said at last, unable to stop herself: What do you think?Arkady laughed and gave her a hug.He was still in his spacesuit, his head looking small in the open neck hole; he felt padded and bulky, and she wanted him out of it.Well, some of it is good and some of it is bad.But why is it so ugly?Why is it so sad?Nadia shrugged, irritated.Weve been busy.So were we on Phobos, but you should see it!Weve walled all the galleries in panels of nickel striped with platinum, and scored the panel surfaces with iterated patterns that the robots run at night, Escher reproductions, mirrors offset for infinite regress, scenes from Earth, you should see it!You can put a candle in some of the chambers and it looks like the stars in the sky, or a room on fire.Every room is a work of art, wait till you see it!I look forward to it.Nadia shook her head, smiling at him.That evening they had a big communal dinner in the four connected chambers that formed the largest room in the complex.They ate chicken and soyburgers and large salads, and everyone talked at once, so that it was reminiscent of the best months on the Ares, or even of Antarctica.Arkady stood to tell them about the work on Phobos.I am glad to be in Underhill at last.They were nearly done doming Stickney, he told them, and under it long galleries had been drilled into the fractured and brecciated rock, following ice veins right through the moon.If it werent for the lack of gravity, it would be a great place, Arkady concluded.But thats one we cant solve.We spent most of our free time on Nadias gravity train, but its cramped, and meanwhile all the work is in Stickney or below it.So we spent too much time weightless or exercising, and even so we lost strength.Even Martian g makes me tired now, Im dizzy right now.Youre always dizzy!So we must rotate crews there, or run it by robot.We are thinking of all coming down for good.Weve done our part up there, a functioning space station is now available for those who follow.Now we want our reward down here!He raised his glass.Frank and Maya frowned.No one would want to go up to Phobos, and yet Houston and Baikonur wanted it manned at all times.Maya had that look on her face familiar from the Ares, the one that said it was all Arkadys fault; when Arkady saw it he burst out laughing.The next day Nadia and several others took him on a more detailed tour of Underhill and the surrounding facilities, and he spent the whole time nodding his head with that pop eyed look of his that made you want to nod back while he said, Yes, but, yes, but, and went into one detailed critique after another, until even Nadia began to get annoyed with him.Although it was hard to deny that the Underhill area was battered, thrashed to the horizon in every direction, so that it seemed as if it continued outward over the whole planet.Its easy to color bricks, Arkady said.Add manganese oxide from the magnesium smelting and you have pure white bricks.Add carbon left over from the Bosch process for black.You can get any shade of red you want by altering the amount of ferric oxides, including some really stunning scarlets.Sulphur for yellows.And there must be something for greens and blues, I dont know what but Spencer might, maybe some polymer based on the sulphur, I dont know.But a bright green would look marvelous in such a red place.It will have a blackish shade to it from the sky, but it will still be green and the eye is pulled to it.And then with these colored bricks, you build walls that are all mosaics.Its beautiful to do it.Everyone can have their own wall or building, whatever they want.All the factories in the Alchemists Quarter look like outhouses or discarded sardine tins.Brick around them would help insulate them, so there is a good scientific reason for it, but truthfully its just as important that they look good, that it looks like home here.Ive already lived too long in a country that thought only of utility.We must show that we value more than that here, yes?No matter what we do to the buildings, Maya pointed out sharply, the ground around them will still be all ripped up.But not necessarily!Look, when construction is over, it would be very possible to grade the ground right back to its original configuration, and then cast loose rock over the surface in a way that would imitate the aboriginal plain.Dust storms would deposit the required fines soon enough, and then if people walked on pathways, and vehicles ran on roads or tracks, soon it would have the look of the original ground, occupied here and there by colorful mosaic buildings, and glass domes stuffed with greenery, and yellow brick roads or whatnot.Of course we must do it!It is a matter of spirit!And thats not to say it could have been done earlier, the infrastructure had to be installed, thats always messy, but now we are ready for the art of architecture, the spirit of it.He waved his hands around, stopped suddenly, popped his eyes at the dubious expressions framed in the faceplates around him.Well, its an idea, yes?Yes, Nadia thought, looking around with interest, trying to visualize it.Perhaps that kind of process would bring back her pleasure in the work?Perhaps it would look different to Ann then?More ideas from Arkady, as Maya put it in the pool that night, looking sour.Just what we need.But theyre good ideas, Nadia said.She got out, showered, put on a jumper.Later that night she met Arkady again, and took him to see the northwest corner chamber of Underhill, which she had left bare walled so she could show him the structural detail.Its very elegant, he said, rubbing a hand over the bricks.Really, Nadia, all of Underhill is magnificent.I can see your hand everywhere on it.Pleased, she went to a screen and called up the plans she had been working on for a larger habitat.Three rows of vaulted chambers stacked underground, in one wall of a very deep trench; mirrors on the opposite wall of the trench, to direct sunlight down into the rooms....Arkady nodded and grinned and pointed at the screen, asking questions and making suggestions: An arcade between the rooms and the wall of the trench for open space.And each story laid back a bit from the one below it, so each has a balcony overlooking the arcade....Yes, that should be possible....And they tapped at the computer screen, altering the architectural sketch as they spoke.Later they walked in the domed atrium.They stood under tall clusters of black bamboo leaves, the plants still in pots while the ground was prepared.It was quiet and dark.We could perhaps lower this area one story, Arkady said softly.Cut windows and doors into your vaults, and lighten them up.Nadia nodded.We thought of that, and were going to do it, but its slow getting so much dirt out through locks.She looked at him.But what about us, Arkady?So far youve only talked about the infrastructure.I should have thought that beautifying buildings would be pretty low down on your list of things to do.Arkady grinned.Well, maybe all the things higher on the list are already done.What?Did I hear Arkady Nikelyovich say that?Well, you know I dont complain just to complain, Ms.Nine Fingers.And the way things have been going down here, its very close to what I was calling for during the voyage out.Close enough that it would be stupid to complain.I must admit you surprise me.Do I?But think about how you all have been working together here, this last year.Half a year.He laughed.Half a year.And for all that time we have had no leaders, really.Those nightly meetings when everyone has their say, and the group decides what needs doing most; thats how it should be.And no one is wasting time buying or selling, because there is no market.Everything here belongs to all equally.And yet none of us can exploit anything that we own, for theres no one outside us to sell it to.Its been a very communal society, a democratic group.All for one and one for all.Nadia sighed.Things have changed, Arkady.Its not like that anymore.And its changing more all the time.So it wont last.Why do you say that?he cried.It will last if we decide that it will.She glanced at him skeptically.You know it isnt so simple.Well, no.Not simple.But within our power!Maybe.She sighed, thinking of Maya and Frank, of Phyllis and Sax and Ann.Theres an awful lot of fighting going on.Thats all right, as long as we agree on certain basic things.She shook her head, rubbed her scar with the fingers of her other hand.Her absent finger was itching, and suddenly she felt depressed.Overhead the long bamboo leaves were defined by occluded stars; they looked like sprays of a giant bacillus.They walked along the path between crop trays.Arkady picked up her maimed hand and peered at the scar, until it made her uncomfortable and she tried to pull it back.He drew it up, gave the newly exposed knuckle at the base of the ring finger a kiss.Youve got strong hands, Ms.Nine Fingers.I did before this, she said, making a fist and holding it up.Someday Vlad will grow you a new finger, he said, and took the fist and opened it, then held the hand as they continued to walk.This reminds me of the arboretum in Sebastopol, he said.Mmm, Nadia said, not really listening, intent on the warm heft of his hand in hers, in the tight intermingling of their fingers.He had strong hands too.She was fifty one years old, a round little Russian woman with gray hair, a construction worker with a missing finger.So nice to feel the warmth of another body; it had been too long, and her hand soaked up the feeling like a sponge, until the poor thing tingled, full and warm.It must feel odd to him, she thought, then gave up on it.Im glad youre here, she said.Having Arkady at Underhill made it like the hour before a thunderstorm.He made people think about what they were doing; habits that they had fallen into without thought came under scrutiny, and under this new pressure some became defensive, others aggressive.All the standing arguments got a bit more intense.Naturally this included the terraforming debate.Now this debate was in no sense a single event but was rather an ongoing process, a topic that kept coming up, a matter of casual exchanges between individuals, out working, eating meals, falling asleep.Any number of things could bring it up: the sight of the white frost plume over Chernobyl; the arrival of a robot driven rover, laden with water ice from the polar station; clouds in the dawn sky.Seeing these or many other phenomena someone would say, Thatll add some BTUs to the system, or Isnt that hexafluoroethane a good greenhouse gas, and perhaps a discussion of the technical aspects of the problem would follow.Sometimes the subject would come back up in the evenings back in Underhill, leading from the technical to the philosophical, and sometimes this led to long and heated arguments.The debate was not, of course, confined to Mars.Position papers were being churned out by policy centers in Houston, Baikonur, Moscow, Washington, and the U.

Office for Martian Affairs in New York, as well as in government bureaus, newspaper editorial offices, corporate board rooms, university campuses, and bars and homes all over the world.In the arguments on Earth, many people began to use the colonists names as a kind of shorthand for the various positions, so that watching the Terran news the colonists themselves would see people saying that they backed the Clayborne position, or were in favor of the Russell program.This reminder of their enormous fame on Earth, their existence as characters in an ongoing TV drama, was always peculiar and unsettling; after the flurry of TV specials and interviews following touchdown, they had tended to forget the ongoing video transmissions, absorbed in the daily reality of their lives.But the video cameras were still shooting tape to send back home; and there were a lot of people on Earth who were fans of the show.So nearly everyone had an opinion.Polls showed that most supported the Russell program, an informal name for Saxs plans to terraform the planet by all means possible, as fast as they could.But the minority who backed Anns hands off attitude tended to be more vehement in their belief, insisting that it had immediate applications to the Antarctic policy, and indeed to all Terran environmental policy.Meanwhile different poll questions made it clear that many people were fascinated by Hiroko and the farming project, while others called themselves Bogdanovists; Arkady had been sending back lots of video from Phobos, and Phobos was good video, a real spectacle of architecture and engineering.New Terran hotels and commercial complexes were already imitating some of its features, there was an architectural movement called Bogdanovism, as well as other movements interested in him that were more concentrated on social and economic reforms in the world order.But terraforming was near the center of all these debates, and the colonists disagreements about it were played out on the largest possible public stage.Some of them reacted by avoiding the cameras and requests for interviews; Its just what I came to get away from, Hirokos assistant Iwao said, and quite a few agreed with him.Most of the rest didnt care one way or the other; a few seemed actually to like it.Phylliss weekly program, for instance, was carried by both Christian cable stations and business analysis programs all over the world.But no matter how they dealt with it, it was becoming clear that most people on Earth and on Mars assumed that terraforming would take place.It was not a question of whether but of when, and how much.Among the colonists themselves this was nearly the universal view.Very few sided with Ann: Simon of course; perhaps Ursula and Sasha; perhaps Hiroko; in his way John, and now in her way Nadia.There were more of these reds back on Earth, but they necessarily held the position as a theory, an aesthetic judgment.The strongest point to their arguments, and thus the one that Ann emphasized most often in her communiqus back to Earth, was the possibility of indigenous life.If there is Martian life here, Ann would say, the radical alteration of the climate might kill it off.We cannot intrude on the situation while the status of life on Mars is unknown; its unscientific, and worse, its immoral.Many agreed with that, including a lot of the Terran scientific community, which influenced the UNOMA committee charged with overseeing the colony.But every time Sax heard the argument he blinked rapidly.Theres no sign of life on the surface, he would say mildly.If it does exist it has to be underground, near volcanic vents I suppose.But even if there is life down there, we could search for ten thousand years and never find it, nor eliminate the possibility it isnt down there somewhere else, somewhere we havent looked.So waiting until we know for sure that there is no life which was a fairly common position among moderateseffectively means waiting forever.For a remote possibility which terraforming wouldnt immediately endanger anyway.Of course it would, Ann would retort.Maybe not immediately, but eventually the permafrost would melt, there would be movement through the hydrosphere, and contamination of all of it by warmer water and Terran lifeforms, bacteria, viruses, algae.It might take a while, but it would surely happen.And we cant risk that.Sax would shrug.First, its postulated life, very low probability.Second, it wouldnt be endangered for centuries.We could presumably locate it and protect it in that time.But we may not be able to find it.So we stop for low probability life we can never actually find?Ann shrugged.We have to, unless you want to argue that its okay to destroy life on other planets, as long as we cant find it.And dont forget, indigenous life on Mars would be the biggest story of all time.It would have implications for the galactic frequency of life that are impossible to exaggerate.Looking for life is one of the main reasons were here!Well, Sax would say, in the meantime, life that we are quite sure exists is being exposed to an extraordinarily high amount of radiation.If we dont do something to lessen it, we may not be able to stay here.We need a thicker atmosphere to cut down on radiation.This was not a reply to Anns point but the substitution of another one, and it was an argument that was very influential.Millions on Earth wanted to come to Mars, to the new frontier, where life was an adventure again; waiting lists for emigration both real and fake were massively oversubscribed.But no one wanted to live in a bath of mutagenic radiation, and the practical desire to make the planet safe for humans was stronger in most people than the desire to preserve the lifeless landscape already there, or to protect a postulated indigenous life that many scientists assured them did not exist.So it did seem, even among those urging caution, that terraforming was going to happen.A subcommittee of UNOMA had been convened to study the issue, and on Earth it was now in the nature of a given, an unavoidable part of progress, a natural part of the order of things.A manifest destiny.On Mars, however, the issue was both more open and more pressing, not so much a matter of philosophy as of daily life, of frigid poisonous air and the radiation being taken; and among those in favor of terraforming, a significant group was clustering around Sax a group that not only wanted to do it, but to do it as fast as possible.What this meant in practice no one was sure; estimates of the time it would take to get to a human viable surface ranged from a century to 10,000 years, with extreme opinions on either end, from thirty years (Phyllis) to 100,000 years (Iwao).Phyllis would say, God gave us this planet to make in our image, to create a new Eden.Simon would say, If the permafrost melts wed be living on a collapsing landscape, and a lot of us would be killed.Arguments wandered over a wide range of issues: salt levels, peroxide levels, radiation levels, the look of the land, possibly lethal mutations of genetically engineered microorganisms, and so on.We can try to model it, Sax said, but the truth is well never be able to model it adequately.Its too big, and there are too many factors, many of them unknown.But what we will learn from it will be useful in controlling Earths climate, in avoiding global warming or a future ice age.Its an experiment, a big one, and it will always be an ongoing experiment, with nothing guaranteed or known for sure.But thats what science is.People would nod at this.Arkady as always was thinking of the political point of view.We can never be self sufficient unless we do terraforming, he pointed out.We need to terraform in order to make the planet ours, so that we will have the material basis for independence.People would roll their eyes at this.But it meant that Sax and Arkady were allies of a sort, and that was a powerful combination.And so the arguments would go around, again and again and again, endlessly.And now Underhill was nearly complete, a functioning and in most ways a self sufficient village.Now it was possible to act further; now they had to decide what to do next.And most of them wanted to terraform.Any number of projects had been proposed to begin the process, with advocates for each, usually those who would be responsible for doing it.This was an important part of terraformings attraction; every discipline could contribute to the enterprise in one way or another, so it had broad based support.The alchemists talked about physical and mechanical means to add heat to the system; the climatologists debated influencing the weather; the biosphere team talked about ecological systems theories to be tested.The bioengineers were already working on new microorganisms: shifting, clipping and recombining genes from algae, methanogens, cyanobacteria, and lichens, trying to come up with organisms that would survive on the present Martian surface, or under it.One day they invited Arkady to take a look at what they were doing, and Nadia went along with him.They had some of their prototype GEMs in Mars jars, the largest of which was one of the old habitats in the trailer park.They had opened it up, shoveled regolith onto the floor, and sealed it again.They worked inside it by teleoperation, and viewed the results from the next trailer over, where instrument gauges took readings, and video screens showed what the various dishes were producing.Arkady looked at every screen closely, but there wasnt that much to see: their old quarters, covered with plastic cubicles filled with red dirt, robot arms extending from their bases against the walls.There were visible growths on part of the soil, a bluish furze.Thats our champion so far, Vlad said.But still only slightly areophylic.They were selecting for a number of extreme characteristics, including resistance to cold and dehydration and UV radiation, tolerance for salts, little need for oxygen, a habitat of rock or soil.No single Terran organism had all these traits, and those that had them individually were usually very slow growers, but the engineers had started what Vlad called a mix and match program, and recently they had come up with a variant of the cyanophyte that was sometimes called bluegreen algae.It is not precisely thriving, but it does not die so fast, let us put it that way.They had named it areophyte primares, its common name becoming Underhill algae.They wanted to make a field trial with it, and had prepared a proposal to send down to UNOMA.Arkady left the trailer park excited by the visit, Nadia could see, and that night he said to the dinner group, We should make the decision on our own, and if we decide in favor, act.Maya and Frank were outraged by this, and clearly most of the rest were uncomfortable as well.Maya insisted on a change of subject, and awkwardly the dinner conversation shifted.The next morning Maya and Frank came to Nadia, to talk about Arkady.The two leaders had already tried to reason with him, late the night before.He laughs in our face!Maya exclaimed.Its useless to try to reason with him!What he proposes could be very dangerous, Frank said.If we explicitly disregard a directive from the U. N. , they could conceivably come here and round us up and ship us home, and replace us with people who will pay attention to the law.I mean, biological contamination of this environment is simply illegal at this point, and we dont have the right to ignore that.Its international treaty.Its how humanity in general wants to treat this planet at this time.Cant you talk to him?Maya asked.I can talk to him, Nadia said.But I cant say that it will do any good.Please, Nadia.Just try.Weve got enough problems as it is.Ill try, sure.So that afternoon she talked to Arkady.They were out on Chernobyl Road, walking back toward Underhill.She brought it up, and suggested that patience was in order.It will only be a matter of time before the U. N.  comes around to your view anyway.He stopped and lifted her maimed hand.How long do you think we have?he said.He pointed at the setting sun.How long do you suggest we wait?For our grandchildren?Our great grandchildren?Our great great grandchildren, blind as cave fish?Come on, Nadia said, pulling her hand free.Cave fish.Arkady laughed.Still, its a serious question.We dont have forever, and it would be nice to see things start to change.Even so, why not wait a year?A Terran year or a Martian year?A Martian year.Get readings on all the seasons, give the U. N.  time to come around.We dont need the readings, theyve been taken now for years.Have you talked to Ann about that?No.Well, sort of.But she doesnt agree.A lot of people dont agree.I mean maybe they will eventually, but you have to convince them.You cant just run roughshod over opposing opinions, otherwise youre just as bad as the people back home that youre always criticizing.Arkady sighed.Yeah yeah.Well, arent you?You damned liberals.I dont know what that means.It means youre too soft hearted to ever actually do anything.But they were now within sight of the low mound of Underhill, looking like a fresh squarish crater, its ejecta scattered around it.Nadia pointed at it.I did that.You damned radicals she jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow, hardyou hate liberalism because it works.He snorted.It does!It works in increments, over time, after hard labor, without fireworks or easy dramatics or people getting hurt.Without your sexy revolutions and all the pain and hatred they bring.It only works.Ah, Nadia.He put his arm over her shoulders, and they started walking again toward base.Earth is a perfectly liberal world.But half of it is starving, and always has been, and always will be.Very liberally.Still, Nadia seemed to have affected him.He quit calling for a unilateral decision to release the new GEMs onto the surface, and he confined the agitprop to his beautification program, spending much of his time in the Quarter, trying to make colored bricks and glass.Nadia joined him for a swim before breakfast on most days, and along with John and Maya they took over a lane in the shallow pool that filled all of one of the vaulted chambers, and swam a brisk workout of one or two thousand meters.John led the sprint sets, Maya led the distance sets, Nadia followed in everything, hampered by her bad hand, and they churned through the extra splashy water like a line of dolphins, staring through their goggles down at the sky blue concrete of the pool bottom.The butterfly was made for this g, John would say, grinning at the way they could practically fly out of the water.Breakfasts afterward were pleasant if brief, and the rest of the days were the usual round of work; Nadia seldom saw Arkady again till evenings at dinner, or afterward.Then Sax and Spencer and Rya finished setting up the robot factory for making Saxs windmill heaters, and they applied to UNOMA for permission to distribute a thousand of them around the equatorial regions, to test their warming effect.All of them together were only expected to add about twice the heat to the atmosphere that Chernobyl did, and there were even questions as to whether they would be able to distinguish the added heat from background seasonal fluctuations but as Sax said, they wouldnt know until they tried.And so the terraforming argument flared again.And suddenly Ann flew into violent action, taping long messages that she sent to the members of UNOMAs executive committee, and to the national offices for Martian affairs for all the countries that were currently on the committee, and finally to the U. N.  General Assembly.These appearances were given enormous amounts of attention, from the most serious policy making levels all the way down to the tabloid press and TV, media that regarded it as the newest episode of the red soap opera.Ann had taped and sent her messages in private, so the colonists learned of them when excerpts were shown on Terran TV.The reaction in the days that followed included debates in government, a rally in Washington that drew 20,000, endless amounts of editorial space, and commentary in the scientific nets.It was a bit shocking to see the strength of these responses, and some colonists felt that Ann had gone behind their backs.Phyllis for one was outraged.Besides, it doesnt make sense, Sax said, blinking rapidly.Chernobyl is already releasing almost as much heat into the atmosphere as these windmills, and she never complained about that.Yes she did, Nadia said.She just lost the vote.Hearings were held at UNOMA, and while they were going on a group of the materials scientists confronted Ann after dinner.
