Naomi, you werent there, you didnt see    I saw it, Jim, through Amos suitcam.I know what it is.I know how much it scares you.It scares the hell out of me too.No, Holden said, his voice surprising him with its anger.No you dont.You werent on Eros when it got out, you never   Hey, I was there.Maybe not for the worst of it.Not like you, Naomi said, her voice still calm.But I did help carry what was left of you and Miller to the med bay.And I watched you try to die there.We cant just accuse Fred of   Right now and I mean right now  Ganymede could be changing.No   Yes.Yes it could.We could be leaving a couple million dead people behind right now who dont know it yet.Melissa and Santichai?Remember them?Now think of them stripped down to whatever pieces the protomolecule finds most useful at the moment.Think of them as parts.Because if that bug is loose on Ganymede, then thats what they are.Jim, Naomi said, a warning in her voice now.This is what Im talking about.The intensity of your feelings isnt evidence.You are about to accuse a man whos been your friend and patron for the last year of maybe killing an entire moon full of people.That isnt the Fred we know.And you owe him better than that.Holden pushed up to a sitting position, part of him wanting to physically distance himself from Naomi, the part of him that was angry with her for not sympathizing enough.I gave Fred the last of it.I gave it to him, and he swore right to my face hed never use it.But thats not what I saw down there.You call him my friend, but Fred has only ever done what would advance his own cause.Even helping us was just another move in his political game.Experiments on kidnapped children?Naomi said.A whole moon one of the most important in the outer planets put at risk and maybe killed outright?Does that make any sense to you?Does that sound like Fred Johnson?The OPA wants Ganymede even more than either inner planet does, Holden said, finally admitting the thing hed feared since theyd found the black filament.And they wouldnt give it to him.Stop, Naomi said.Maybe hes trying to drive them off, or he sold it to them in exchange for the moon.That would at least explain the heavy inner planets traffic weve been seeing   No.Stop, she said.I dont want to sit here and listen to you talk yourself into this.Holden started to speak, but Naomi sat up facing him and gently put her hand over his mouth.I didnt like this new Jim Holden youve been turning into.The guy whod rather reach for his gun than talk?I know being the OPAs bagman has been a shitty job, and I know weve had to do a lot of pretty rotten things in the name of protecting the Belt.But that was still you.I could still see you lurking there under the surface, waiting to come back.Naomi, he said, pulling her hand away from his face.This guy who cant wait to go all High Noon in the streets of Tycho?Thats not Jim Holden at all.I dont recognize that man, she said, then frowned.No.Thats not right.I do recognize him.But his name was Miller.For Holden, the most awful part was how calm she was.She never raised her voice, never sounded angry.Instead, infinitely worse, there was only a resigned sadness.If thats who you are now, you need to drop me off somewhere.I cant go with you anymore, she said.Im out.Twenty Three: Avasarala  Avasarala stood at her window, looking out at the morning haze.In the distance, a transport lifted off.It rode an exhaust plume that looked like a pillar of bright white cloud, and then it was gone.Her hands ached.She knew that some of the photons striking her eyes right now had come from explosions light minutes away.Ganymede Station, once the safest place without an atmosphere, then a war zone, and now a wasteland.She could no more pick out the light of its death than pluck a particular molecule of salt from the ocean, but she knew it was there, and the fact was like a stone in her belly.I can ask for confirmation, Soren said.Nguyen should be filing his command report in the next eighteen hours.Once we have that   Well know what he said, Avasarala snapped.I can tell you that right now.The Martian forces took a threatening position, and he was forced to respond aggressively.La la fucking la.Where did he get the ships?Hes an admiral, Soren said.I thought he came with them.She turned.The boy looked tired.Hed been up since the small hours of the morning.They all had.His eyes were bloodshot, and his skin pallid and clammy.I took apart that command group myself, she said.I pared it down until you could have drowned it in a bathtub.And hes out there now with enough firepower to take on the Martian fleet?Apparently, Soren said.She fought the urge to spit.The rumble of the transport engines finally reached her, the sound muffled by distance and the glazing.The light was already gone.To her sleep deprived mind, it was exactly like playing politics in the Jovian system or the Belt.Something happened she could see it happen but she heard it only after the fact.When it was too late.Shed made a mistake.Nguyen was a war hawk.The kind of adolescent boy who still thought any problem could be solved by shooting it enough.Everything hed done was as subtle as a lead pipe to the kneecap, until this.Now hed reassembled his command without her knowing it.And hed had her pulled from the Martian negotiations.Which meant that he hadnt done any of it.Nguyen had either a patron or a cabal.She hadnt seen that he was a bit player, so whoever called his tune had surprised her.She was playing against shadows, and she hated it.More light, she said.Excuse me?Find out how he got those ships, she said.Do it before you go to sleep.I want a full accounting.Where the replacement ships came from, who ordered them, how they were justified.Everything.Would you also like a pony, maam?Youre fucking right I would, she said, and sagged against her desk.You do good work.Someday you might get a real job.Im looking forward to it, maam.Is she still around?At her desk, Soren said.Should I send her in?You better had.When Bobbie came into the room, a film of cheap paper in her fist, it struck Avasarala again how poorly the Martian fit in.It wasnt only her accent or the difference in build that spoke of a childhood in the lower Martian gravity.In the halls of politics, the womans air of physical competence stood out.She looked like shed been rousted out of bed in the middle of the night, just like all of them; it was only that it looked good on her.Might be useful, might not, but certainly it was worth remembering.What have you got?Avasarala asked.The marines frown was all in her forehead.Ive gotten through to a couple of people in the command.Most of them dont know who the hell I am, though.I probably spent as much time telling them I was working for you as I did talking about Ganymede.Its a lesson.Martian bureaucrats are stupid, venal people.What did they say?Long story?Short.You shot at us.Avasarala leaned back in her chair.Her back hurt, her knees hurt, and the knot of sorrow and outrage that was always just under her heart felt brighter than usual.Of course we did, she said.The peace delegation?Already gone, Bobbie said.Theyll be releasing a statement sometime tomorrow about how the UN was negotiating in bad faith.Theyre still fighting out the exact wording.Whats the hold?Bobbie shook her head.She didnt understand.What words are they fighting over, and which side wants which words?Avasarala demanded.I dont know.Does it matter?Of course it mattered.The difference between The UN has been negotiating in bad faith and The UN was negotiating in bad faith could be measured in hundreds of lives.Thousands.Avasarala tried to swallow her impatience.It didnt come naturally.All right, she said.See if theres anything else you can get me.Bobbie held out the paper.Avasarala took it.The hell is this?she asked.My resignation, Bobbie said.I thought youd want all the paperwork in place.Were at war now, so Ill be shipping back.Getting my new assignment.Who recalled you?No one, yet, Bobbie said.But   Will you please sit down?I feel like Im at the bottom of a fucking well, talking to you.The marine sat.Avasarala took a deep breath.Do you want to kill me?Avasarala asked.Bobbie blinked, and before she could answer, Avasarala lifted her hand, commanding silence.I am one of the most powerful people in the UN.Were at war.So do you want to kill me?Iguess so?You dont.You want to find out who killed your men and you want the politicians to stop greasing the wheels with Marine blood.And holy shit!What do you know?I want that too.But Im active duty Martian military, Bobbie said.If I stay working for you, Im committing treason.The way she said it wasnt complaint or accusation.They havent recalled you, Avasarala said.And theyre not going to.The wartime diplomatic code of contact is almost exactly the same for you as it is for us, and its ten thousand pages of nine point type.If you get orders right now, I can put up enough queries and requests for clarifications that youll die of old age in that chair.If you just want to kill someone for Mars, youre not going to get a better target than me.If you want to stop this idiotic fucking war and find out whos actually behind it, get back to your desk and find out who wants what wording.Bobbie was silent for a long moment.You mean that as a rhetorical device, she said at last, but it would make a certain amount of sense to kill you.And I can do it.A tiny chill hit Avasaralas spine, but she didnt let it reach her face.Ill try not to oversell the point in the future.Now get back to work.Yes, sir, Bobbie said, then stood and walked out of the room.Avasarala blew out a breath, her cheeks ballooning.She was inviting Martian Marines to slaughter her in her own office.She needed a fucking nap.Her hand terminal chimed.An unscheduled high status report had just come through, the deep red banner overriding her usual display settings.She tapped it, ready for more bad news from Ganymede.It was about Venus.Until seven hours earlier, the Arboghast had been a third generation destroyer, built at the Bush Shipyards thirteen years before and later refitted as a military science vessel.For the last eight months, shed been orbiting Venus.Most of the active scanning data that Avasarala had relied on had come from her.The event she was watching had been captured by two lunar telescopic stations with broad spectrum intelligence feeds that happened to be at the correct angles, and about a dozen shipborne optical observers.The dataset they collected agreed perfectly.Play it again, Avasarala said.Michael Jon de Uturbe had been a field technician when shed first met him, thirty years before.Now he was the de facto head of the special sciences committee and married to Avasaralas roommate from university.In that time, his hair had fallen out or grown white, his dark brown skin had taken to draping a bit off of his bones, and he hadnt changed the brand of cheap floral cologne he wore.He had always been an intensely shy, almost antisocial, man.In order to maintain the connection, she knew not to ask too much of him.His small, cluttered office was less than a quarter of a mile from hers, and she had seen him five times in the last decade, each of them moments when she needed to understand something obscure and complex quickly.He tapped his hand terminal twice, and the images on the display reset.The Arboghast was whole once more, floating in false color detail above the haze of Venusian cloud.The time stamp started moving forward, one second per second.Walk me through, she said.Um.Well.We start from the spike.Its just like the one we saw that last time Ganymede started going to hell.Splendid.Thats two datapoints.This came before the fighting, he said.Maybe an hour.A little less.It had come during Holdens firefight.Before she could bring him in.But how could Venus be responding to Holdens raid on Ganymede?Had Bobbies monsters been part of that fight?Then the radio ping.Right he froze the display here.Massive sweep in three second by seven second grid.It was looking, but it knew where to look.All those active scans, Id assume.Called attention.All right.He started the playback again.The resolution went a few degrees grainier, and he made a pleased sound.This was interesting, he said, as if the rest were not.Radiative pulse of some kind.Interfered with all the telescopy except a strictly visible spectrum kit on Luna.Only lasted a tenth of a second, though.The microwave burst after it was pretty normal active sensor scanning.You sound disappointed perched at the back of Avasaralas tongue, but the dread and anticipation of what would come next stopped it.The Arboghast, with 572 souls aboard her, came apart like a cloud.Hull plates peeled away in neat, orderly rows.Super structural girders and decks shifted apart.The engineering bays detached, slipping away.In the image before her, the full crew had been exposed to hard vacuum.In the moment she was looking at now, they were all dying and not yet dead.That it was like watching a construction plan animation crew quarters here, the engineering section here, the plates cupping the drive thus and so only made it more monstrous.Now this is especially interesting, Michael Jon said, stopping the playback.Watch what happens when we increase magnification.Dont show them to me, Avasarala wanted to say.I dont want to watch them die.But the image he moved in on wasnt a human being, but a knot of complicated ducting.He advanced it slowly, frame by frame, and the image grew misty.Its ablating?she asked.What?No, no.Here, Ill bring you closer.The image jumped in again.The cloudiness was an illusion created by a host of small bits of metal: bolts, nuts, Edison clamps, O rings.She squinted.It wasnt a loose cloud either.Like iron filings under the influence of a magnet, each tiny piece was held in line with the ones before and behind it.The Arboghast wasnt torn apart, he said.It was disassembled.It looks as though there were about fifteen separate waves, each one undoing another level of the mechanism.Stripped the whole thing down to the screws.Avasarala took a deep breath, then another, then another, until the sound lost its ragged edge and the awe and fear grew small enough that she could push it to the back of her mind.What does this?she said at last.Shed meant it as a rhetorical question.Of course there was no answer.No force known to humanity could do what had just been done.That wasnt the meaning he took.Graduate students, he said brightly.My Industrial Design final was just the same.They gave us all machines and we had to take them apart and figure out what they did.Extra credit was to deliver an improved design.And a moment later, his voice melancholy: Of course we also had to put them back together, yes?On the display, the rigidity and order of the floating bits of metal stopped, and the bolts and girders, vast ceramic plates and minute clamps began to drift, set in chaotic motion by the departure of whatever had been holding them.Seventy seconds from first burst to the end.A little over a minute, and not a shot fired in response.Not even something clearly to be shot.The crew?Took their suits apart.Didnt bother disassembling the bodies.Might have interpreted them as a logical unit or might already know all it needs to about human anatomy.Whos seen this?Michael Jon blinked, then shrugged, then blinked again.This this, or a version of this?Were the only one with both high def feeds, but its Venus.Everyone who was looking saw it.Not like its in a sealed lab.She closed her eyes, pressing her fingers against the bridge of her nose as if she were fighting a headache while she struggled to keep the mask in place.Better to seem in pain.Better to seem impatient.The fear shook her like a seizure, like something happening to somebody else.Tears welled up in her eyes, and she bit her lip until they went away.She pulled up the personnel locator on her hand terminal.Nguyen was out of the question even if hed been in conversational range.Nettleford was with a dozen ships burning toward Ceres Station, and she wasnt entirely certain of him.Souther.Can you send this version to Admiral Souther?Oh, no.Its not cleared for release.Avasarala looked at him, her expression empty.Are you clearing it for release?I am clearing it for release to Admiral Souther.Please send it immediately.Michael Jon bobbed a quick nod, tapping with the tips of both pinkies.Avasarala took out her own hand terminal and sent a simple message to Souther.WATCH AND CALL ME.When she stood, her legs ached.It was good seeing you again, Michael Jon said, not looking at her.We should all have dinner sometime.Lets, Avasarala said, and left.The womens restroom was cold.Avasarala stood at the sink, her palms flat against the granite.She wasnt used to fear or awe.Her life had been about control, talking and bullying and teasing whoever needed it until the world turned the direction she wanted it to.The few times the implacable universe had overwhelmed her haunted her: an earthquake in Bengal when shed been a girl, a storm in Egypt that had trapped her and Arjun in their hotel room for four days as the food supplies failed, the death of her son.Each one had turned her constant pretense of certainty and pride against her, left her curled in her bed at night for weeks afterward, her fingers bent in claws, her dreams nightmares.This was worse.Before, she could comfort herself with the idea that the universe was empty of intent.That all the terrible things were just the accidental convergences of chance and mindless forces.The death of the Arboghast was something else.It was intentional and inhuman.It was like seeing the face of God and finding no compassion there.Shaking, she pulled up her hand terminal.Arjun answered almost immediately.From the set of his jaw and the softness of his eyes, she knew he had seen some version of the event.And his thought hadnt been for the fate of mankind, but for her.She tried to smile, but it was too much.Tears ran down her cheeks.Arjun sighed gently and looked down.I love you very much, Avasarala said.Knowing you has let me bear the unbearable.Arjun grinned.He looked good with wrinkles.He was a more handsome man now that he was older.As if the round faced, comically earnest boy whod snuck to her window to read poems in the night had only been waiting to become this.I love you, I have always loved you, if we are born into new lives, I will love you there.Avasarala sobbed once, wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, and nodded.All right, then, she said.Back to work?Back to work.I may be home late.Ill be here.You can wake me.They were silent for a moment; then she released the connection.Admiral Souther hadnt called.Errinwright hadnt called.Avasaralas mind was leaping around like a terrier attacking a troop transport.She rose to her feet, forced herself to put one foot in front of the other.The simple physical act of walking seemed to clear her head.Little electric carts stood ready to whisk her back to her office, but she ignored them, and by the time she reached it, she was almost calm again.Bobbie sat hunched at her desk, the sheer physical bulk of the woman making the furniture seem like something from grade school.Soren was elsewhere, which was fine.His training wasnt military.So youre in an entrenched position with a huge threat coming down onto you, right?Avasarala said, sitting down on the edge of Sorens desk.Say youre on a moon and some third party has thrown a comet at you.Massive threat, you understand?Bobbie looked at her, confused for a moment, and then, with a shrug, played along.All right, the marine said.So why do you choose that moment to pick a fight with your neighbors?Are you just frightened and lashing out?Are you thinking that the other bastards are responsible for the rock?Are you just that stupid?Were talking about Venus and the fighting in the Jovian system, Bobbie said.Its a pretty fucking thin metaphor, yes, Avasarala said.So why are you doing it?Bobbie leaned back in her chair, plastic creaking under her.The big womans eyes narrowed.She opened her mouth once, closed it, frowned, and began again.Im consolidating power, Bobbie said.If I use my resources stopping the comet, then as soon as that threats gone, I lose.The other guy catches me with my pants down.Bang.If I kick his ass first, then when its over, I win.But if you cooperate   Then you have to trust the other guy, Bobbie said, shaking her head.Theres a million tons of ice coming thats going to kill you both.Why the hell wouldnt you trust the other guy?Depends.Is he an Earther?Bobbie said.Weve got two major military forces in the system, plus whatever the Belters can gin up.Thats three sides with a lot of history.When whatevers going to happen on Venus actually happens, someone wants to already have all the cards.And if both sides Earth and Mars are making that same calculation, were going to spend all our energy getting ready for the war after next.Yep, Bobbie said.And yes, thats how we all lose together.Twenty Four: Prax  Prax sat in his cabin.For sleeping space on a ship, he knew it was large.Spacious, even.Altogether, it was smaller than his bedroom on Ganymede had been.He sat on the gel filled mattress, the acceleration gravity pressing him down, making his arms and legs feel heavier than they were.He wondered whether the sense of suddenly weighing more specifically the discontinuous change of space travel triggered some evolutionary cue for fatigue.The feeling of being pulled to the floor or the bed was so powerfully like the sensation of bone melting tiredness it was easy to think that sleeping a little more would fix it, would make things better.Your daughter is probably dead, he said aloud.Waited to see how his body would react.Mei is probably dead.He didnt start sobbing this time, so that was progress.Ganymede was a day and a half behind him and already too small to pick out with the naked eye.Jupiter was a dim disk the size of a pinky nail, kicking back the light of a sun that was little more than an extremely bright star.Intellectually, he knew that he was falling sunward, heading in from the Jovian system toward the Belt.In a week, the sun would be close to twice the size it was now, and it would still be insignificant.In a context of such immensity, of distances and speeds so far above any meaningful human experience, it seemed like nothing should matter.He should be agreeing that he hadnt been there when God made the mountains, whether it meant the ones on Earth or on Ganymede or somewhere farther out in the darkness.He was in a tiny metal and ceramic box that was exchanging matter for energy to throw a half dozen primates across a vacuum larger than millions of oceans.Compared to that, how could anything matter?Your daughter is probably dead, he said again, and this time the words caught in his throat and started to choke him.It was, he thought, something about the sense of being suddenly safe.On Ganymede, hed had fear to numb him.Fear and malnutrition and routine and the ability at any moment to move, to do something even if it was utterly useless.Go check the boards again, go wait in line at security, trot along the hallways and see how many new bullet holes pocked them.On the Rocinante, he had to slow down.He had to stop.There was nothing for him to do here but wait out the long sunward fall to Tycho Station.He couldnt distract himself.There was no station not even a wounded and dying one to hunt through.There were only the cabin hed been given, his hand terminal, a few jumpsuits a half size too big for him.A small box of generic toiletries.That was everything he had left.And there was enough food and clean water that his brain could start working again.Each passing hour felt like waking up a little more.He knew how badly his body and mind had been abused only when he got better.Every time, he felt like this had to be back to normal, and then not long after, hed find that, no, there had been more.So he explored himself, probing at the wound at the center of his personal world like pressing the tip of his tongue into a dry socket.Your daughter, he said through the tears, is probably dead.But if she isnt, you have to find her.That felt better or, if not better, at least right.He leaned forward, his hands clasped, and rested his chin.Carefully, he imagined Katoas body, laid out on its table.When his mind rebelled, trying to think about something anything else, he brought it back and put Mei in the boys place.Quiet, empty, dead.The grief welled up from a place just above his stomach, and he watched it like it was something outside himself.During his time as a graduate student, he had done data collection for a study of Pinus contorata.Of all the varieties of pine to rise off Earth, lodgepole pine had been the most robust in low g environments.His job had been to collect the fallen cones and burn them for the seeds.In the wild, lodgepole pine wouldnt geminate without fire; the resin in the cones encouraged a hotter fire, even when it meant the death of the parental tree.To get better, it had to get worse.To survive, the plant had to embrace the unsurvivable.He understood that.Mei is dead, he said.You lost her.He didnt have to wait for the idea to stop hurting.It would never stop hurting.But he couldnt let it grow so strong it overwhelmed him.He had the sense of doing himself permanent spiritual damage, but it was the strategy he had.And from what he could tell, it seemed to be working.His hand terminal chimed.The two hour block was up.Prax wiped the tears away with the back of his hand, took a deep breath, blew it back out, and stood.Two hours, twice a day, hed decided, would be enough time in the fire to keep him hard and strong in this new environment of less freedom and more calories.Enough to keep him functional.He washed his face in the communal bathroom the crew called it the head and made his way to the galley.The pilot Alex, his name was stood at the coffee machine, talking to a comm unit on the wall.His skin was darker than Praxs, his thinning hair black, with the first few stray threads of white.His voice had the odd drawl some Martians affected.Im seein eight percent and falling.The wall unit said something cheerful and obscene.Amos.Im tellin you, the seals cracked, Alex said.I been over it twice, Amos said from the comm.The pilot took a mug with the word Tachi printed on it from the coffee machine.Third times the charm.Arright.Stand by.The pilot took one long, lip smacking sip from the mug, then, noticing Prax, nodded.Prax smiled uncomfortably.Feelin better?Alex asked.Yes.I think so, Prax said.I dont know.Alex sat at one of the tables.The design of the room was military all soft edges and curves to minimize damage if someone was caught out of place by an impact or a sudden maneuver.The food inventory control had a biometric interface that had been disabled.Built for high security, but not used that way.The name ROCINANTE was on the wall in letters as broad as his hand, and someone had added a stencil of a spray of yellow narcissus.It looked desperately out of place and very appropriate at the same time.When he thought about it that way, it seemed to fit most things about the ship.Her crew, for instance.You settlin in all right?You need anything?Im fine, Prax said with a nod.Thank you.They beat us up pretty good gettin out of there.Ive been through some ugly patches of sky, but that was right up there.Prax nodded and took a food packet from the dispenser.It was textured paste, sweet and rich with wheat and honey and the subterranean tang of baked raisins.Prax sat down before he thought about it, and the pilot seemed to take it as an invitation to continue the conversation.How long have you been on Ganymede?Most of my life, Prax said.My family went out when my mother was pregnant.Theyd been working on Earth and Luna, saving up to get to the outer planets.They had a short posting on Callisto first.Belters?Not exactly.They heard that the contracts were better out past the Belt.It was the whole make a better future for the family idea.My fathers dream, really.Alex sipped at his coffee.And so, Praxidike.They named you after the moon?They did, Prax said.They were a little embarrassed to find out it was a womans name.I never minded it, though.My wife my ex wife thought it was endearing.Its probably why she noticed me in the first place, really.It takes something to stand out a little, and you cant swing a dead cat on Ganymede without hitting five botany PhDs.Or, well, you couldnt.The pause was just long enough that Prax knew what was coming and could steel himself for it.I heard your daughter went missing, Alex said.Im sorry about that.Shes probably dead, Prax said, just the way hed practiced.It had to do with that lab yall found down there, did it?I think so.It must have.They took her just before the first incident.Her and several of the others in her group.Her group?She has an immune disorder.Myers Skelton Premature Immunosenescence.Always has had.My sister had a brittle bone disorder.Hard, Alex said.Is that why they took her?I assume so, Prax said.Why else would you steal a child like that?Slave labor or sex trade, Alex said softly.But cant see why youd pick out kids with a medical condition.It true you saw protomolecule down there?Apparently, Prax said.The food bulb was cooling in his hand.He knew he should eat more he wanted to, as good as it tasted but something was turning at the back of his mind.Hed thought this all through before, when hed been distracted and starving.Now, in this civilized coffin hurtling through the void, all the old familiar thoughts started to touch up against each other.Theyd specifically targeted the children from Meis group.Immunocompromised children.And theyd been working with the protomolecule.The captain was on Eros, Alex said.It must have been a loss for him when it happened, Prax said to have something to say.No, I dont mean he lived there.He was on the station when it happened.We all were, but he was on it the longest.He actually saw it starting.The initial infected.That.Really?Changed him, some.Ive been flyin with him since we were just fartin around on this old ice bucket running from Saturn to the Belt.He didnt used to like me, I suspect.Now were family.Its been a hell of a trip.Prax took a long pull from his food bulb.Cool, the paste tasted less of wheat and more of honey and raisin.It wasnt as good.He remembered the look of fear on Holdens face when theyd found the dark filaments, the sound of controlled panic in his voice.It made sense now.And as if summoned by the thought, Holden appeared in the doorway, a formed aluminum case under his arm with electromagnetic plates along the base.A personal footlocker designed to stay put even under high g.  Prax had seen them before, but hed never needed one.Gravity had been a constant for him until now.Capn, Alex said with a vestigial salute.Everything all right?Just moving some things to my bunk, Holden said.The tightness in his voice was unmistakable.Prax had the sudden feeling that he was intruding on something private, but Alex and Holden didnt give any further sign.Holden only moved off down the hall.When he was out of earshot, Alex sighed.Trouble?Prax asked.Yeah.Dont worry.Its not about you.This has been brewin for a while now.Im sorry, Prax said.Had to happen.Best to get it over with one way or the other, Alex said, but there was an unmistakable dread in his voice.Prax felt himself liking the man.The wall terminal chirped and then spoke in Amos voice.Whatve you got now?Alex pulled the terminal close, the articulated arm bending and twisting on complicated joints, then tapped on it with the fingers of one hand while keeping hold of the coffee with the other.The terminal flickered, datasets converting to graphs and tables in real time.Ten percent, Alex said.No.Twelve.Were moving up.Whatd you find?Cracked seal, Amos said.And yeah, youre very fucking clever.What else we got?Alex tapped on the terminal and Holden reappeared from the hallway, now without his case.Port sensor array took a hit.Looks like we burned out a few of the leads, Alex said.All right, Amos said.Lets get those bad boys swapped out.Or maybe we can do something that doesnt involve crawling on the outside of a ship under thrust, Holden said.I can get it done, Cap, Amos said.Even through the tinny wall speaker, he sounded affronted.Holden shook his head.One slip, and the exhaust cooks you down to component atoms.Lets leave that for the techs on Tycho.Alex, what else have we got?Memory leak in the navigation system.Probably a fried network that grew back wrong, the pilot said.The cargo bays still in vacuum.The radio arrays as dead as a hammer for no apparent reason.Hand terminals arent talking.And one of the medical pods is throwing error codes, so dont get sick.Holden went to the coffee machine, talking over his shoulder as he keyed in his preferences.His cup said Tachi too.Prax realized with a start that they all did.He wondered who or what a Tachi was.Does the cargo bay need EVA?Dont know, Alex said.Lemme take a look.Holden took his coffee mug out of the machine with a little sigh and stroked the brushed metal plates like he was petting a cat.On impulse, Prax cleared his throat.Excuse me, he said.Captain Holden?I was wondering, if the radio gets fixed or theres a tightbeam available, if maybe there was a way I could use some time on the communications array?Were kind of trying to be quiet right now, Holden said.What are you wanting to send?I need to do some research, Prax said.The data we got on Ganymede from when they took Mei.There are images of the woman who was with them.And if I can find what happened to Dr.Strickland Ive been on a security locked system since the day she went missing.Even if it was just the public access databases and networks, it would be a place to start.And its that or sit around and stew until we get to Tycho, Holden said.All right.Ill ask Naomi to get you an access account for the Rocis network.I dont know if therell be anything in the OPA files, but you might as well check them too.Really?Sure, Holden said.Theyve got a pretty decent face recognition database.Its inside their secure perimeter, so you might need to have one of us make the request.And that would be all right?I dont want to get you in trouble with the OPA.Holdens smile was warm and cheerful.Really, dont worry about that, he said.Alex, whatve we got?Looks like cargo doors not sealin, which we knew.We may have taken a hit, blown a hole in her.Weve got the video feed back up hold on  Holden shifted to peer over Alexs shoulder.Prax took another swallow of his food and gave in to curiosity.An image of a cargo bay no wider than Praxs palm took up one corner of the display.Most of the cargo was on electromagnetic pallets, stuck to the plates nearest the wide bay door, but some had broken loose, pressed by thrust gravity to the floor.It gave the room an unreal, Escher like appearance.Alex resized the image, zooming in on the cargo door.In one corner, a thick section of metal was bent inward, bright metal showing where the bend had cracked the external layers.A spray of stars showed through the hole.Well, at least it aint subtle, Alex said.What hit it?Holden said.Dont know, Cap, Alex said.No scorching as far as I can see.But a gauss round wouldnt have bent the metal in like that.Just would have made a hole.And the bay isnt breached, so whatever did it didnt make a hole on the other side.The pilot increased the magnification again, looking closely at the edges of the wound.It was true there were no scorch marks, but thin black smudges showed against the metal of the door and the deck.Prax frowned.He opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again.Holden said what Prax had been thinking.Alex?Is that a handprint?Looks like one, Cap, but  Pull out.Look at the decking.They were small.Subtle.Easy to overlook on the small image.But they were there.A handprint, smeared in something dark that Prax had the strong suspicion had once been red.The unmistakable print of five naked toes.A long smear of darkness.The pilot followed the trail.That bays in hard vacuum, right?Holden asked.Has been for a day and a half, sir, Alex said.The casual air was gone.They were all business now.Track right, Holden said.Yes, sir.Okay, stop.Whats that?The body was curled into a fetal ball, except where its palms were pressed against the bulkhead.It lay perfectly still, as if they were under high g and it was held against the deck, crushed by its own weight.The flesh was the black of anthracite and the red of blood.Prax couldnt tell if it had been a man or a woman.Alex, do we have a stowaway?Pretty sure that aint on the cargo manifest, sir.And did that fellow there bend his way through my ship with his bare hands?Looks like maybe, sir.Amos?Naomi?Im looking at it too.Naomis voice came from the terminal a moment before Amos low whistle.Prax thought back to the mysterious sounds of violence in the lab, the bodies of guards they hadnt fought, the shattered glass and its black filament.Here was the experiment that had slipped its leash back at that lab.It had fled to the cold, dead surface of Ganymede and waited there until a chance came to escape.Prax felt the gooseflesh crawling up his arms.Okay, Holden said.But its dead, right?I dont think so, Naomi said.Twenty Five: Bobbie  Bobbies hand terminal began playing reveille at four thirty a. m.  local time: what she and her mates might have grumbled and called oh dark thirty back when shed been a marine and had mates to grumble with.Shed left her terminal in the living room, lying next to the pull down cot she used as a bed, the volume set high enough to have left her ears ringing if shed been in there with it.But Bobbie had already been up for an hour.In her cramped bathroom, the sound was only annoying, bouncing around her tiny apartment like radio in a deep well.The echoes were a sonic reminder that she still didnt have much furniture or any wall hangings.It didnt matter.Shed never had a guest.The reveille was a mean spirited little joke Bobbie was playing on herself.The Martian military had formed hundreds of years after trumpets and drums had been a useful means of transmitting information to troops.Martians lacked the nostalgia the UN military had for such things.The first time Bobbie had heard a morning reveille, shed been watching a video on military history.Shed been happy to realize that no matter how annoying the Martian equivalent a series of atonal electronic blats was, it would never be as annoying as what the Earth boys woke up to.But now Bobbie wasnt a Martian Marine anymore.I am not a traitor, Bobbie said to her reflection in the mirror.Mirror Bobbie looked unconvinced.After the blaring trumpet calls third repetition, her hand terminal beeped once and fell into a sullen silence.Shed been holding her toothbrush for the last half hour.The toothpaste had started to grow a hard skin.She ran it under warm water to soften it back up and started brushing her teeth.Im not a traitor, she said to herself, the toothbrush making the words unintelligible.Not.Not even standing here in the bathroom of her UN provided apartment, brushing her teeth with UN toothpaste and rinsing the sink with UN provided water.Not while she clutched her good Martian toothbrush and scrubbed until her gums bled.Not, she said again, daring mirror Bobbie to disagree.She put the toothbrush back into her small toiletry case, carried it into the living room, and placed it in her duffel.Everything she owned stayed in the duffel.Shed need to move fast when her people called her home.And they would.Shed get a priority dispatch on her terminal, the red and gray border of the MCRN CINCCOM flashing around it.Theyd tell her that she needed to return to her unit immediately.That she was still one of them.That she wasnt a traitor for staying.She straightened her uniform, slid her now quiet terminal into her pocket, and checked her hair in the mirror next to the door.It was pulled into a bun so tight it almost gave her a face lift, not one single hair out of place.Im not a traitor, she said to the mirror.Front hallway mirror Bobbie seemed more open to this idea than bathroom mirror Bobbie had.Damn straight, she said, then slammed the door behind her when she left.She hopped on one of the little electric bikes the UN campus made available everywhere, and was in the office three minutes before five a. m.  Soren was already there.No matter what time she came in, Soren always beat her.Either he slept at his desk or he was spying on her to see what time she set her alarm for each morning.Bobbie, he said, his smile not even pretending to be genuine.Bobbie couldnt bring herself to respond, so she just nodded and collapsed into her chair.One glance at the darkened windows in Avasaralas office told her the old lady wasnt in yet.Bobbie pulled up her to do list on the desktop screen.She had me add a lot of people, Soren said, referring to the list of people Bobbie was supposed to call in her role as Martian military liaison.She really wants to get a hold of an early draft of the Martian statement on Ganymede.Thats your top priority for the day.Okay?Why?Bobbie said.The actual statement came out yesterday.We both read it.Bobbie, Soren said with a sigh that said he was tired of explaining simple things to her, but a grin that said he really wasnt.This is how the game is played.Mars releases a statement condemning our actions.We go back channel and find an early draft.If it was harsher than the actual statement that was released, then someone in the dip corps argued to tone it down.That means theyre trying to avoid escalating.If it was milder in the early draft, then theyre deliberately escalating to provoke a response.But since they know youll get those early drafts, then thats meaningless.Theyll just make sure you get leaks that give you the impression they want you to have.See?Now youre getting it, Soren said.What your opponent wants you to think is useful data in figuring out what they think.So get the early draft, okay?Do it before the end of the day.But no one talks to me anymore because now Im the UNs pet Martian, and even though Im not a traitor, it is entirely possible that everyone else thinks I am.Okay.Bobbie pulled up the newly revised list and made the first connection request of the day.Bobbie!Avasarala yelled from her desk.There was any number of electronic means for getting Bobbies attention, but she almost never saw Avasarala use them.She yanked her earbud free and stood up.Sorens smirk was of the psychic variety; his face didnt change at all.Maam?Bobbie said, taking a short step into Avasaralas office.You bellowed?No one likes a smart ass, Avasarala said, not looking up from her desk terminal.Wheres my first draft of that report?Its almost lunchtime.Bobbie stood a little straighter and clasped her arms behind her back.Sir, I regret to inform you that I have been unable to find anyone willing to release the early draft of the report to me.Are you standing at attention?Avasarala said, looking up at her for the first time.Jesus.Im not about to march you out to the firing squad.Did you try everyone on the list?Yes, I  Bobbie stopped for a moment and took a deep breath, then took a few more steps into the office.Quietly she said, No one talks to me.The old woman lifted a snow white eyebrow.Thats interesting.It is?Bobbie said.Avasarala smiled at her, a warm, genuine smile, then poured tea out of a black iron pot into two small teacups.Sit down, she said, waving at a chair next to her desk.When Bobbie remained standing, Avasarala said, Seriously, sit the fuck down.Five minutes talking to you and I cant tilt my head forward again for an hour.Bobbie sat, hesitated, and took one of the small teacups.It wasnt much larger than a shot glass, and the tea inside it was very dark and smelled unpleasant.She took a small sip and burned her tongue.Its a Lapsang souchong, Avasarala said.My husband buys it for me.What do you think?I think it smells like hobo feet, Bobbie replied.No shit, but Arjun loves it and its not bad once you get used to drinking it.Bobbie nodded and took another sip but didnt reply.Okay, so, Avasarala said, youre the Martian who was unhappy and got tempted over to the other side by a powerful old lady with lots of shiny prizes to offer.Youre the worst kind of traitor, because ultimately everything thats happened to you since you came to Earth was because you were pouting.I   Shut the fuck up now, dear, the grown up is talking.Bobbie shut up and drank her awful tea.But, Avasarala continued, the same sweet smile on her wrinkled face, if I were on the other team, you know who Id send misinformation leaks to?Me, Bobbie said.You.Because youre desperate to prove your value to your new boss, and they can send you blatantly false information and not really care if they fuck your shit up in the long run.If I were the Martian counterespionage wonks, Id have already recruited one of your closest friends back home and be using them to funnel a mountains worth of false data your direction.My closest friends are all dead, Bobbie thought.But no one   Is talking to you from back home.Which means two things.They are still trying to figure out my game in keeping you here, and they dont have a misinformation campaign in place because theyre as confused as we are.Youll be contacted by someone in the next week or so.Theyll ask you to leak information from my office, but theyll ask it in such a way that winds up giving you a whole lot of false information.If youre loyal and spy for them, great.If not and you tell me what they asked for, also great.Maybe theyll get lucky and youll do both.Bobbie put the teacup back on the desk.Her hands were in fists.This, Bobbie said, is why everyone hates politicians.No.They hate us because we have power.Bobbie, this isnt how your mind likes to work, and I respect that.I dont have time to explain things to you, Avasarala said, the smile disappearing like it had never been.So just assume I know what Im doing, and that when I ask you to do the impossible, its because even your failure helps our cause somehow.Our cause?Were on the same team here.Team Lets Not Lose Together.That is us, isnt it?Yes, Bobbie said, glancing at the Buddha in his shrine.He smiled at her serenely.Just one of the team, his round face seemed to say.Yes it is.Then get the fuck back out there and start calling everyone all over again.This time take detailed notes on who refuses to help you and the exact words they use in their refusal.Okay?Solid copy on that, maam.Good, Avasarala said, smiling gently again.Get out of my office.Familiarity might breed contempt, but Bobbie hadnt much liked Soren right from the start.Sitting next to him for several days had ratcheted up her dislike to a whole new level.When he wasnt ignoring her, he was condescending.He talked too loud on his phone, even when she was trying to carry on a conversation of her own.Sometimes he sat on her desk, talking to visitors.He wore too much cologne.The worst thing was he ate cookies all day.It was impressive, given his rail thin build, and Bobbie was not generally the kind of person who cared at all about other peoples dietary habits.But his preferred brand of cookie came out of the break room vending machine in a foil packet that crinkled every time he reached into it.At first, this had only been annoying.But after a couple of days of the Crinkle, Crunch, Chomp, and Smack Radio Theater, shed had enough.She dropped her latest pointless connection and turned to stare at him.He ignored her and tapped on his desk terminal.Soren, she said, meaning to ask him to dump the damn cookies out on a plate or a napkin so she didnt have to hear that infuriating crinkle sound anymore.Before she could get more than his name out, he held up a finger to shush her and pointed at his earbud.No, he said, not really a good   Bobbie wasnt sure if he was talking to her or someone on the phone, so she got up and moved over to his desk, sitting on the edge of it.He gave her a withering glare, but she just smiled and mouthed, Ill wait.The edge of his desk creaked a little under her weight.He turned his back to her.I understand, he said.But this is not a good time to discuss  I see.I can probably  I see, yes.Foster wont  Yes.Yes, I understand.Ill be there.He turned back around and tapped his desk, killing the connection.What?I hate your cookies.The constant crinkle of the package is driving me insane.Cookies?Soren said, a baffled expression on his face.Bobbie thought that it might be the first honest emotion shed ever seen there.Yeah, can you put them on a  Bobbie started, but before she could finish, Soren grabbed up the package and tossed them into the recycling bin next to his desk.Happy?Well   I dont have time for you right now, Sergeant.Okay, Bobbie said, and went back to her desk.Soren kept fidgeting like he had more to say, so Bobbie didnt call the next person on her list.She waited for him to speak.Probably the cookie thing had been a mistake on her part.Really, it wasnt a big deal.If she werent under so much pressure, it wasnt the sort of thing shed probably even notice.When Soren finally spoke up, shed apologize for being so pushy about it and then offer to buy him a new package.Instead of speaking, he stood up.Soren, I  Bobbie started, but Soren ignored her and unlocked a drawer on his desk.He pulled out a small bit of black plastic.Probably because shed just heard him say the name Foster, Bobbie recognized it as the memory stick Avasarala had given him a few days earlier.Foster was the data services guy, so she assumed he was finally getting around to taking care of that little task, which would at least get him away from the office for a few minutes.Until he turned and headed for the elevators.Bobbie had done a little gofer work running things back and forth to data services and knew that their office was on the same floor and in the opposite direction of the elevators.Huh.She was tired.She was half sick with guilt and she wasnt even all that sure what she felt guilty about.She disliked the man anyway.The hunch that popped into her head was almost certainly a result of her own paranoia and addled image of the world.She got up, following him.This is really stupid, she said to herself, smiling and nodding at a page who hurried by.She was over two meters tall on a planet of short people.She wasnt going to blend.Soren climbed into an elevator.Bobbie stopped outside the doors and waited.Through the aluminum and ceramic doors, she heard him ask someone to press one.Going all the way to the street level, then.She hit the down button and took the next elevator to the bottom floor.Of course, he wasnt in sight when she got there.A giant Martian woman running around the lobby of the UN building would draw a little attention, so she scrapped that as a plan.A wave of uncertainty, failure, and despair lapped at the shoreline of her mind.Forget that it was an office building.Forget that there were no armed enemy, no squad behind her.Forget that, and look at the logic of the situation on the ground.Think tactically.Be smart.I need to be smart, she said.A short woman in a red suit who had just come up and pressed the elevator call button overheard her and said, What?I need to be smart, Bobbie told her.Cant go running off half cocked.Not even when doing something insane and stupid.I see, the woman said, then pushed the elevator call button again several times.Next to the elevator control panel was a courtesy terminal.If you cant find the target, restrict the targets degrees of freedom.Make them come to you.Right.Bobbie hit the button for the lobby reception desk.An automated system with an extremely realistic and sexually ambiguous voice asked how it could assist her.Please page Soren Cottwald to the lobby reception desk, Bobbie said.The computer on the other end of the line thanked her for using the UN automated courtesy system and dropped the connection.Soren might not have his terminal on, or it could be set to ignore incoming pages.Or he might ignore this one all on his own.She found a couch with a sight line to the desk and shifted a ficus to provide her cover.Two minutes later, Soren trotted up to the reception desk, his hair more windblown than usual.He must have already been all the way outside when he got the page.He began talking to one of the human receptionists.Bobbie moved across the lobby to a little coffee and snack kiosk and hid as best she could.After typing on her desk for a moment, the receptionist pointed at the terminal next to the elevators.Soren frowned and took a few steps toward it, then looked around nervously and headed toward the building entrance.Bobbie followed.Once Bobbie was outside, her height was both an advantage and a disadvantage.Being a head and a half taller than most everyone around her meant that she could afford to stay pretty far behind Soren as he hurried along the sidewalk.She could spot the top of his head from half a city block away.At the same time, if he looked behind him, he couldnt miss her face sticking up a good third of a meter out of the crowd.But he didnt turn around.In fact, he appeared to be in something of a hurry, pushing his way through the knots of people on the busy sidewalks around the UN campus with obvious impatience.He didnt look around or pause by a good reflective surface or backtrack.Hed been nervous answering the page, and he was being pointedly, angrily not nervous now.Whistling past the graveyard.Bobbie felt her muscles soften, her joints grow loose and easy, her hunch slip a centimeter closer to certainty.After three blocks he turned and went into a bar.Bobbie stopped a half block away and considered.The front of the bar, a place creatively named Petes, was darkened glass.If you wanted to duck in somewhere and see if people were following you, it was the perfect place to go.Maybe hed gotten smart.Maybe he hadnt.Bobbie walked over to the front door.Getting caught following him had no consequences.Soren already hated her.The most ethically suspect thing she was doing was cutting out early to pop into a neighborhood bar.Who was going to rat on her?Soren?The guy who cut out just as early and went to the same damn bar?If he was in there and doing nothing more than grabbing an early beer, shed just walk up to him, apologize for the cookie thing, and buy him his second round.She pushed the door open and went inside.It took her eyes a moment to adjust from the early afternoon sunlight outside to the dimly lit bar.Once the glare had faded, she saw a long bamboo bar top manned by a human bartender, half a dozen booths with about as many patrons, and no Soren.The air smelled of beer and burnt popcorn.The patrons gave her one look and then carefully went back to their drinks and mumbled conversations.Had Soren ducked out the back to ditch her?She didnt think hed seen her, but she wasnt exactly trained for tailing people.She was about to ask the bartender if hed seen a guy run through, and where that guy might have gone, when she noticed a sign at the back of the bar that said POOL TABLES with an arrow pointing left.She walked to the back of the bar, turned left, and found a smaller, second room with four pool tables and two men.One of them was Soren.They both looked up as she turned the corner.Hi, she said.Soren was smiling at her, but he was always smiling.Smiling, for him, was protective coloration.Camouflage.The other man was large, fit, and wearing an excessively casual outfit that tried too hard to look like it belonged in a seedy pool hall.It clashed with the mans military haircut and ramrod straight posture.Bobbie had a feeling shed seen his face before, but in a different setting.She tried to picture him with a uniform on.Bobbie, Soren said, giving his companion one quick glance and then looking away.You play?He picked up a pool cue that had been lying on one of the tables, and began chalking the tip.Bobbie didnt point out that there were no balls on any of the tables, and that a sign just behind Soren said RENTAL BALLS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.His companion said nothing but slid something into his pocket.Between his fingers Bobbie caught a glimpse of black plastic.She smiled.She knew where shed seen the second man before.No, she said to Soren.Its not popular where I come from.Slate, I guess, he replied.His smile became a bit more genuine and a lot colder.He blew the chalk dust off the pool cues tip and moved a step to the side, shifting toward her left.Too heavy for the early colony ships.Makes sense, Bobbie said, moving back until the doorway protected her flanks.Is this a problem?Sorens companion said, looking at Bobbie.Before Soren could reply, Bobbie said, You tell me.You were at that late night meeting in Avasaralas office when Ganymede went to shit.Nguyens staff, right?Lieutenant something or other.Youre digging a hole, Bobbie, Soren said, the pool cue held lightly in his right hand.And, she continued, I know Soren handed you something his boss had asked him to take to data services a couple days ago.I bet you dont work in data services, do you?Nguyens flunky took a menacing step toward her, and Soren shifted to her left again.Bobbie burst out laughing.Seriously, she said, looking at Soren.Either stop jerking that pool cue off or take it somewhere private.Soren looked down at the cue in his hand as though surprised to see it there, then dropped it.And you, Bobbie said to the flunky.You trying to come through this door would literally be the high point of my month.Without moving her feet she shifted her weight forward and flexed her elbows slightly.The flunky looked her in the eye for one long moment.She grinned back.Come on, she said.Im gonna get blue balls you keep teasing me like this.The flunky put up his hands.Something halfway between a fighting stance and a gesture of surrender.Never taking his eyes off Bobbie, he turned his face slightly toward Soren and said, This is your problem.Handle it.He backed up two slow steps, then turned and walked across the room and into a hallway Bobbie couldnt see from where she was standing.A second later, she heard a door slam.Shit, Bobbie said.I bet Id have scored more points with the old lady if Id gotten that memory stick back.Soren began to shuffle toward the back door.Bobbie crossed the space between them like a cat, grabbing the front of his shirt and pulling him up until their noses were almost touching.Her body felt alive and free for the first time in a long time.What are you going to do, he said through a forced smirk, beat me up?Naw, Bobbie replied, shifting to an exaggerated Mariner Valley drawl.Im gonna tell on you, boy.Twenty Six: Holden  Holden watched the monster quiver as it huddled against the cargo bay bulkhead.On the video monitor, it looked small and washed out and grainy.He concentrated on his breathing.Long slow breath in, fill up the lungs all the way to the bottom.Long slow breath out.Pause.Repeat.Do not lose your shit in front of the crew.Well, Alex said after a minute.Theres your problem.He was trying to make a joke.Had made a joke.Normally, Holden would have laughed at his exaggerated drawl and comic obviousness.Alex could be very funny, in a dry, understated sort of way.Right now, Holden had to clench his hands to stop from strangling the man.Amos said, Im coming up, at the same moment Naomi said, Im coming down.Alex, Holden said, pretending a calm he didnt feel.Whats the status of the cargo bay airlock?Alex tapped twice on the terminal and said, Airtight, Cap.Zero loss.Which was good, because as frightened of the protomolecule as he was, Holden also knew that it wasnt magic.It had mass and it occupied space.If not even a molecule of oxygen could sneak out through the airlock seal, then he was pretty sure none of the virus could get in.But  Alex, crank up the O2, Holden said.As rich as we can get it without blowing the ship up.The protomolecule was anaerobic.If any of it did somehow get in, he wanted the environment as hostile as possible.And get up to the cockpit, he continued.Seal yourself in.If the goo somehow gets loose on the ship, I need your finger on the reactor overrides.Alex frowned and scratched his thin hair.That seems a little extreme   Holden grabbed him by the upper arms, hard.Alexs eyes went wide and his hands came up in an automatic gesture of surrender.Beside him, the botanist blinked in confusion and alarm.This was not the best way to instill confidence.In other circumstances, Holden might have cared.Alex, Holden said, not able to stop himself from shaking even while clutching the pilots arms.Can I count on you to blow this ship into gas if that shit gets in here?Because if I cant, consider yourself relieved of duty and confined to quarters immediately.Alex surprised him, not by reacting in anger, but by reaching up and putting his hands on Holdens forearms.Alexs face was serious, but his eyes were kind.Seal myself into the cockpit and prepare to scuttle the ship.Aye, aye, sir, he said.Whats the stand down order?Direct order from myself or Naomi, Holden replied with a hidden sigh of relief.He didnt have to say, If that thing gets in here and kills us, youre better off going up with the ship.He let go of Alexs arms and the pilot took one step back, his broad dark face wrinkled with concern.The panic that threatened to overwhelm Holden might get out of his control if he allowed anyone to feel sympathy for him, so he said, Now, Alex.Do it now.Alex nodded once, looked like he wanted to say something else, then spun on his heel and went to the crew ladder and up toward the cockpit.Naomi descended the same ladder a few moments later, and Amos came up from below a short time after that.Naomi spoke first.Whats the plan?Theyd been intimate long enough for Holden to recognize the barely concealed fear in her voice.Holden paused to take two more long breaths.Amos and I will go see if we cant drive it out the cargo bay doors.Get them open for us.Done, she said, and headed up the ladder to ops.Amos was watching him, a speculative look in his eyes.So, Cap, how do we drive it out those doors?Well, Holden replied.I was thinking we shoot the shit out of it and then take a flamethrower to any pieces that fall off.So we better gear up.Amos nodded.Damn.I feel like I just took that shit off.Holden was not claustrophobic.No one who chose long flight space travel as a career was.Even if a person could somehow con their way past the psychological profiles and simulation runs, one trip was usually enough to separate those who could handle long periods in confined spaces from those who went bugfuck and had to be sedated for the trip home.As a junior lieutenant Holden had spent days in scout ships so small that you literally could not bend over to scratch your feet.Hed climbed around between the inner and outer hulls of warships.Hed once been confined to his crash couch for twenty one days during a fast burn trip from Luna to Saturn.He never had nightmares of being crushed or being buried alive.For the first time in his decade and a half of nearly constant space travel, the ship he was on felt too small.Not just cramped, but terrifyingly constricted.He felt trapped, like an animal in a snare.Less than twelve meters away from where he stood, someone infected with the protomolecule was sitting in his cargo bay.And there was nowhere he could go to get away from it.Putting on his body armor didnt help this feeling of confinement.The first thing that went on was what the grunts called the full body condom.It was a thick black bodysuit, made of multiple layers of Kevlar, rubber, impact reactive gel, and the sensor network that kept track of his injury and vitals status.Over that went the slightly looser environment suit, with its own layers of self sealing gel to instantly repair tears or bullet holes.And finally, the various pieces of strap on armor plating that could deflect a high velocity rifle shot or ablate the outer layers to shed the energy of a laser.To Holden, it felt like wrapping himself in his own death shroud.But even with all its layers and weight, it still wasnt as frightening as the powered armor that recon Marines wore would have been.What the Navy boys called walking coffins.The idea behind the name being that anything powerful enough to break the armor would liquefy the marine inside, so you didnt bother to open it.You just tossed the whole thing into the grave.This was hyperbole, of course, but the idea of going into that cargo bay wearing something that he wouldnt even be able to move without the power enhanced strength would have scared the shit out of him.What if the batteries died?Of course, a nice suit of strength augmenting armor might be handy when trying to throw monsters off the ship.Thats on backward, Amos said, pointing at Holdens thigh.Shit, Holden said.Amos was right.Hed been so far up his own ass that hed screwed up the buckles on his thigh armor.Sorry, Im having a hard time staying focused here.Scared shitless, Amos said with a nod.Well, I wouldnt say   Wasnt talking about you, Amos said.Me.Im scared shitless of walking into the cargo bay with that thing in there.And I didnt watch Eros turn into goo at close range.So I get it.Right there with you, Jim.It was the first time in Holdens memory that Amos had called him by his first name.Holden nodded back at him, then went about straightening out his thigh armor.Yeah, he said.I just yelled at Alex for not being scared enough.Amos had finished with his armor and was pulling his favorite auto shotgun out of his locker.No shit?Yeah.He made a joke and Im scared out of my skull, so I yelled at him and threatened to relieve him.Can you do that?Amos asked.Hes kind of our only pilot.No, Amos.No, I cant kick Alex off the ship any more than I can kick you or Naomi off the ship.Were not even a skeleton crew.Were whatever you have when you dont have a skeleton.Worried about Naomi leaving?Amos said.He kept his voice light, but his words hit like hammer blows.Holden felt the air go out of him, and had to focus on breathing again for a minute.No, he said.I mean, yes, of course I am.But thats not what has me freaked out right now.Holden picked up his assault rifle and looked at it, then put it back in his locker and took out a heavy recoilless pistol instead.The self contained rockets that were its ammunition wouldnt impart thrust and send him flying all over the place if he fired it in zero g.   I watched you die, he said, not looking at Amos.Huh?I watched you die.When that kidnap team, whoever the hell they were, took us.I saw one of them shoot you in the back of the head, and I saw you drop face first on the floor.There was blood everywhere.Yeah, but I   I know it was a nonlethal round.I know they wanted us alive.I know the blood was your broken nose when your head slammed into the floor.I know all of that now.At the time, what I knew was that youd just been shot in the head and killed.Amos slid a magazine into his shotgun and racked a round but, other than that, didnt make a sound.All of this is really fragile, Holden said, waving around at Amos and the ship.This little family we have.One fuckup, and something irreplaceable gets lost.Amos was frowning at him now.This is still about Naomi, right?No!I mean, yes.But no.When I thought you were dead, it knocked all the wind out of me.And right now, I need to focus on getting that thing off the ship, and all I can think about is losing one of the crew.Amos nodded, slung the shotgun over his shoulder, and sat down on the bench next to his locker.I get it.So what do you want to do?I want, Holden said, sliding a magazine into his pistol, to get that fucking monster off my ship.But please promise me you wont die doing it.That would help a lot.Cap, Amos said with a grin.Anything that kills me has already killed everyone else.I was born to be the last man standing.You can count on it.The panic and fear didnt leave Holden.They squatted on his chest now just the way they had before.But at least he didnt feel so alone with them.Then lets go get rid of this stowaway.The wait inside the cargo bay airlock was endless as the inner door sealed, the pumps sucked all the air out of the room, and then the outer door cycled open.Holden fidgeted and rechecked his gun half a dozen times while he waited.Amos stood in a relaxed slump, his huge shotgun cradled loosely in his arms.The upside, if there was an upside to the wait, was that with the cargo bay in vacuum, the airlock could make as much noise as it wanted without alerting the creature to their presence.The last of the external noise disappeared, and Holden could hear only himself breathing.A yellow light came on near the outer airlock door, warning them of the null atmosphere on the other side.Alex, Holden said, plugging a hardline into the airlock terminal.Radio was still dead all over the ship.Were about to go in.Kill the engines.Roger that, Alex replied, and the gravity dropped away.Holden kicked the slide controls on his heels to turn up his magnetic boots.The cargo bay on the Rocinante was cramped.Tall and narrow, it occupied the starboard side of the ship, crammed into the unused space between the outer hull and the engineering bay.On the port side, the same space was filled with the ships water tank.The Roci was a warship.Any cargo it carried would be an afterthought.The downside to this was that while under thrust, the cargo bay turned into a well with the cargo doors at the bottom.The various crates that occupied the space latched on to mounts on the bulkheads or in some cases were attached with electromagnetic feet.With thrust gravity threatening to send a person tumbling seven meters straight down to the cargo doors, it would be an impossible place to fight effectively.In microgravity, it became a long hallway with lots of cover.Holden entered the room first, walking along the bulkhead on magnetic boots, and took cover behind a large metal crate filled with extra rounds for the ships point defense cannons.Alex followed, taking up a position behind another crate two meters away.Below them, the monster seemed to be asleep.It huddled motionless against the bulkhead that separated the cargo bay from engineering.Okay, Naomi, go ahead and open it up, Holden said.He jiggled the trailing line of cable to get it unhooked from a corner of the crate and gave it a little slack.Doors opening now, she replied, her voice thin and fuzzy in his helmet.The cargo doors at the bottom of the room silently swung open, exposing several square meters of star filled blackness.The monster either didnt notice the doors opening or didnt care.They hibernate sometimes, right?Amos said, the cable running from his suit to the airlock looking like a high tech umbilical cord.Like Julie did when she got the bug.Hibernated in that hotel room on Eros for a couple weeks.Maybe, Holden replied.How do you want to approach this?Im almost thinking we should just go down there, grab the thing, and toss it out the door.But I have strong reservations about touching it.Yeah, wouldnt want to take our suits back inside with us, Amos agreed.Holden had a sudden memory of coming in after playing outside, and taking all his clothes off in the mudroom before Mother Tamara would let him into the rest of the house.This would be pretty much the same, only a lot colder.I find myself wishing we had a really long stick, Holden said, looking around at the various objects stored in the cargo bay, hoping to find one that suited his need.Uh, Capn?Amos said.Its looking at us.Holden turned back around and saw Amos was right.The creature hadnt moved anything but its head, but it was definitely staring up at them now, its eyes a creepy illuminated from within blue.Well, okay, Holden said.Its not hibernating.You know, if I can knock it off that bulkhead with a shot or two, and Alex kicks on the engine, it might just tumble right out the back door and into the exhaust plume.That oughta take care of it.Lets think about  Holden said, but before he could finish his thought, the room strobed several times with the muzzle flash of Amos shotgun.The monster was hit multiple times and knocked into a spinning lump floating toward the door.Alex, just  Amos said.The monster blurred into action.It flung one arm toward the bulkhead, the limb actually seeming to get longer to reach it, and yanked down hard enough to bend the steel plates.The creature hurtled up to the top of the cargo bay so fast that when it hit the crate Holden was hiding behind, the magnetic feet lost their seal.The cargo bay seemed to spin as the impact threw Holden back.The crate, just behind him, matched his velocity.Holden slammed against the bulkhead a split second before the crate did, and the magnetic pallet snapped onto the new wall, trapping Holdens leg beneath it.Something in his knee bent badly, and the pain turned the world red for a moment.Amos began firing his gun into the monster at close range, but it casually backhanded him and threw him into the cargo airlock hard enough to bend the inner door.The outer door slammed shut the second the inner door was compromised.Holden tried to move but his leg was pinned by the crate, and with electromagnets rated to hold a quarter ton of weight under a ten g burn, he wouldnt be moving it anytime soon.The crate controls that would shut the magnets off showed the orange glow of a full seal ten centimeters beyond his reach.The monster turned back to look at him.Its blue eyes were far too large for its head, giving the creature a curious, childlike look.It reached out one oversized hand.Holden fired into it until his gun was empty.The miniature, self contained rockets the recoilless gun used as ammunition exploded in tiny puffs of light and smoke as they hit the creature, each one pushing it farther back and tearing large chunks of its torso away.Black filaments sprayed out and across the room like a line drawing representation of blood splatter.When the last rocket hit, the monster was blown off the bulkhead and thrown down the cargo bay toward the open doors.The black and red body tumbled toward the vast swatch of stars and darkness, and Holden let himself hope.Less than a meter from the doors, it reached out one long arm and caught the edge of a crate.Holden had seen what kind of strength was in those hands, and knew it wouldnt lose its grip.Captain, Amos was yelling in his ear.Holden, are you still with us?Here, Amos.In a little trouble.As he spoke, the monster pulled itself up onto the crate it had caught and sat motionless.A hideous gargoyle turned suddenly to stone.Gonna hit the override and get you, Amos said.The inner door is fucked, so well lose some atmo, but not too much   Okay, but do it soon, Holden said.Im pinned.I need you to cut the mags on this crate.A moment later, the airlock door opened in a puff of atmosphere.Amos started to step out into the bay when the monster jumped off the crate it was sitting on, grabbed the heavy plastic container with one hand and the bulkhead with the other, and threw the container at him.It slammed into the bulkhead hard enough that Holden felt the vibration through his suit.It missed taking Amos head off by centimeters.The big mechanic fell back with a curse and the airlock doors shot closed again.Sorry, Amos said.Panicked.Let me get this open   No!Holden yelled.Stop opening the damn door.Im trapped behind two goddamn crates now.And one of these times, the door is going to cut my cable.I really dont want to be stuck in here without a radio.With the airlock closed, the monster moved back over to the bulkhead next to the engine room and curled up into a ball again.The tissue in the gaping wounds caused by Holdens gun pulsed wetly.I can see it, Cap, Alex said.If I stomp on the gas, I think I can knock it right out those doors.No, Naomi and Amos said at almost the same time.No, Naomi repeated.Look where Holden is under those crates.If we go high g, itll break every bone in his body, even if he somehow isnt thrown out the door too.Yeah, shes right, Amos said.That planll kill the captain.Its off the table.Holden listened for a few moments to his crew argue about how to keep him alive, and watched the creature snuggle itself up the bulkhead and seem to go back to sleep.Well, Holden said, breaking into their discussion.A high g burn would almost certainly break me into tiny pieces right now.But that doesnt necessarily take it off the table.The new words that came over the channel seemed like a thing from another world.Holden didnt even recognize the botanists voice at first.Well, Prax said.Thats interesting.Twenty Seven: Prax  When Eros died, everyone watched.The station had been designed as a scientific data extraction engine, and every change, death, and metamorphosis had been captured, recorded, and streamed out to the system.What the governments of Mars and Earth had tried to suppress had leaked out in the weeks and months that followed.How people viewed it had more to do with who they were than the actual footage.To some people, it had been news.For others, evidence.For more than Prax liked to think, it had been an entertainment of terrible decadence a Busby Berkeley snuff flick.Prax had watched it too, as had everyone on his team.For him, it had been a puzzle.The drive to apply the logic of conventional biology to the effects of the protomolecule had been overwhelming and, for the most part, fruitless.Individual pieces were tantalizing the spiral curves so similar to nautilus shell, the heat signature of the infected bodies shifting in patterns that almost matched certain hemorrhagic fevers.But nothing had come together.Certainly someone, somewhere, was getting the grant money to study what had happened, but Praxs work wouldnt wait for him.Hed turned back to his soybeans.Life had gone on.It hadnt been an obsession, just a well known conundrum that someone else was going to have to solve.Prax hung weightless at an unused station in ops and watched the security camera feed.The creature reached out for Captain Holden, and Holden shot it and shot it and shot it.Prax watched the filamentous discharge from the creatures back.That was familiar, certainly.It had been one of the hallmarks of the Eros footage.The monster began to tumble.Morphologically, it wasnt very far off from human.One head, two arms, two legs.No autonomous structures, no hands or rib cages repurposed to some other function.Naomi, at the controls, gasped.It was odd, hearing it only through the actual air they shared and not through the comm channel.It seemed intimate in a way that left him a little uncomfortable, but there was something more important.His mind had a fuzzy feeling, like his head was full of cotton ticking.He recognized the sensation.He was thinking something that he wasnt yet aware of.Im pinned, Holden said.I need you to cut the mags on this crate.The creature was at the far end of the cargo bay.As Amos went in, it braced itself with one hand, throwing a large crate with the other.Even in the poor quality feed, Prax could see its massive trapezius and deltoids, the muscles enlarged to a freakish degree.And yet not particularly relocated.So the protomolecule was working under constraints.Whatever the creature was, it wasnt doing what the Eros samples had done.The thing in the cargo bay was unquestionably the same technology, but harnessed for some different application.The cotton ticking shifted.No!Stop opening the damn door.Im trapped behind two goddamn crates now.The creature moved back to the bulkhead, near where it had first been at rest.It huddled there, the wounds in its body pulsing visibly.But it hadnt settled there.With the engines off line, there wasnt even a trace of gravity to pull it back in place.If it was comfortable there, there had to be a reason.No!Naomi said.Her hands were on the support rings by the controls.Her face had an ashy color.No.Look where Holden is under those crates.If we go high g, itll break every bone in his body, even if he somehow isnt thrown out the door too.Yeah, shes right, Amos said.He sounded tired.Maybe that was how he expressed sorrow.That planll kill the captain.Its off the table.Well.A high g burn would almost certainly break me into tiny pieces right now.But that doesnt necessarily take it off the table.On the bulkhead, the creature moved.It wasnt much, but it was there.Prax zoomed in on it as best he could.One massive clawed hand clawed but still with four fingers and a thumb braced it, and the other tore at the bulkhead.The first layer was fabric and insulation and it came off in rubbery strips.Once it was gone, the creature attacked the armored steel underneath.Tiny curls of metal floated in the vacuum beside it, catching the light like little stars.Now why was it doing that?If it was trying to do structural damage, there was any number of better ways.Or maybe it was trying to tunnel through the bulkhead, trying to reach something, following some signal  The cotton ticking disappeared, resolving into the image of a pale, new root springing from a seed.He felt himself smile.Well, thats interesting.What is, Doc?Amos asked.Prax realized he must have spoken aloud.Um, Prax said, trying to gather the words that would explain what hed seen.Its trying to move up a radiation gradient.I mean the version of the protomolecule that was loose on Eros fed off radiation energy, and so I guess it makes sense that this one would too   This one?Alex asked.What one?This version.I mean, this ones obviously been engineered to repress most of the changes.Its hardly changed the host body at all.There have to be novel constraints on it, but it still seems to need a source of radiation.Why, Doc?Amos asked.He was trying to be patient.Why do we think it needs radiation?Oh, Prax said.Because we shut down the drive, and so the reactor is running at maintenance level, and now its trying to dig through to the core.There was a pause, and then Alex said something obscene.Okay, Holden said.Theres no choice.Alex, you need to get that thing out of here before it gets through the bulkhead.We dont have time to build a new plan.Captain, Alex said.Jim   Ill be in one second after its gone, Amos said.If you arent there, its been an honor serving with you, Cap.Prax waved his hands, as if the gesture could get their attention.The movement sent him looping slowly through the operations deck.Wait.No.That is the new plan, he said.Its moving up a radiation gradient.Its like a root heading toward water.Naomi had turned to look at him as he spun.She seemed to spin, and Praxs brain reset to feeling that she was below him, spiraling away.He closed his eyes.Youre going to have to walk us through this, Holden said.Quickly.How can we control it?Change the gradient, Prax said.How long would it take to put together a container with some unshielded radioisotopes?Depends, Doc, Amos said.How much do we need?Just more than is leaking through from the reactor right now, Prax said.Bait, Naomi said, catching hold of him and pulling him to a handhold.You want to make something that looks like better food and lure that thing out the door with it.I just said that.Didnt I just say that?Prax asked.Not exactly, no, Naomi said.On the screen, the creature was slowly building a cloud of metal shavings.Prax wasnt sure, because the resolution of the image wasnt actually all that good, but it seemed like its hand might be changing shape as it dug.He wondered how much the constraints placed on the protomolecules expression took damage and healing into account.Regenerative processes were a great opportunity for constraining systems to fail.Cancer was just cell replication gone mad.If it was starting to change, it might not stop.Regardless, Prax said, I think we should probably hurry.The plan was simple enough.Amos would reenter the cargo bay and free the captain as soon as the bay doors had shut behind the intruder.Naomi, in ops, would trigger the doors to close the moment the creature had gone after the radioactive bait.Alex would fire the engines as soon as doing so wouldnt kill the captain.And the bait a half kilo cylinder with a thin case of lead foil to keep it from attracting the beast too early would be walked out through the main airlock and tossed into the vacuum by the only remaining crewman.Prax floated in the airlock, bait trap in the thick glove of the environment suit.Regrets and uncertainty flooded through his mind.Maybe it would be better if Amos did this part, Prax said.Ive never actually done any extravehicular anything before.Sorry, Doc.Ive got a ninety kilo captain to haul, Amos said.Couldnt we automate this?A lab waldo could   Prax, Naomi said, and the gentleness of the syllable carried the weight of a thousand get your ass out theres.Prax checked the seals on his suit one more time.Everything reported good.The suit was much better than the one hed worn leaving Ganymede.It was twenty five meters from the personnel airlock near the front of the ship to the cargo bay doors at the extreme aft.He wouldnt even have to go all the way there.He tested the radio tether to make sure it was clipped tightly into the airlocks plug.That was another interesting question.Was the radio jamming effect a natural output of the monster?Prax tried to imagine how such a thing could be generated biologically.Would the effect end when the monster left the ship?When it was burned up by the exhaust?Prax, Naomi said.Now is good.All right, he said.Im going out.The outer airlock door cycled open.His first impulse was to push out into the darkness the way he would into a large room.His second was to crawl on his hands and knees, keeping as much of his body against the skin of the ship as humanly possible.Prax took the bait in one hand and used the toe rings to lift himself up and out.The darkness around him was overwhelming.The Rocinante was a raft of metal and paint on an ocean.More than an ocean.The stars wrapped around him in all directions, the nearest ones hundreds of lifetimes away, and then more past those and more past those.The sense of being on a tiny little asteroid or moon looking up at a too wide sky flipped and he was at the top of the universe, looking down into an abyss without end.It was like a visual illusion flipping between a vase and then two faces, then back again at the speed of perception.Prax grinned up, spreading his arms into the nothingness even as the first taste of nausea crawled up the back of his tongue.Hed read accounts of extravehicular euphoria, but the experience was unlike anything hed imagined.He was the eye of God, drinking in the light of infinite stars, and he was a speck of dust on a speck of dust, clipped by his mag boots to the body of a ship unthinkably more powerful than himself, and unimportant before the face of the abyss.His suits speakers crackled with background radiation from the birth of the universe, and eerie voices whispered in the static.Uh, Doc?Amos said.There a problem out there?Prax looked around, expecting to see the mechanic beside him.The milk white universe of stars was all that met him.With so many, it seemed like they should sum to brightness.Instead, the Rocinante was dark except for the EVA lights and, toward the rear of the ship, a barely visible white nebula where atmosphere had blown out from the cargo bay.No, Prax said.No problems.He tried to take a step forward, but his suit didnt budge.He pulled, straining to lift his foot from the plating.His toe moved forward a centimeter and stopped.Panic flared in his chest.Something was wrong with the mag boots.At this rate, hed never make it to the cargo bay door before the creature dug through and into engineering and the reactor itself.Um.I have a problem, he said.I cant move my feet.What are the slide controls set to?Naomi asked.Oh, right, Prax said, moving the boot settings down to match his strength.Im fine.Never mind.Hed never actually walked with mag boots before, and it was a strange sensation.For most of the stride, his leg felt free and almost uncontrolled, and then, as he brought his foot toward the hull, there would be a moment, a critical point, when the force took hold and slammed him to the metal.He made his way floating and being snatched down, step by step.He couldnt see the cargo bay doors, but he knew where they were.From his position looking aft, they were to the left of the drive cone.But on the right side of the ship.No, starboard side.They call it starboard on ships.He knew that just past the dark metal lip that marked the edge of the ship, the creature was digging at the walls, clawing through the flesh of the ship toward its heart.If it figured out what was going on if it had the cognitive capacity for even basic reasoning it could come boiling up out of the bay at him.Vacuum didnt kill it.Prax imagined himself trying to clomp away on his awkward magnetic boots while the creature cut him apart; then he took a long, shuddering breath and lifted the bait.Okay, he said.Im in position.No time like the present, Holden said, his voice strained with pain but attempting to be light.Right, Prax said.He pressed the small timer, hunched close to the hull of the ship, and then, with every muscle in his body, uncurled and flung the little cylinder into nothing.It flew out, catching the light from the cargo bay interior and then vanishing.Prax had the nauseating certainty that hed forgotten a step, and that the lead foil wouldnt come off the way it was supposed to.Its moving, Holden said.It smelled it.Its going out.And there it was, long black fingers folding up from the ship, the dark body pulling itself up to the ships exterior like it had been born to the abyss.Its eyes glowed blue.Prax heard nothing but his own panicked breathing.Like an animal in the ancient grasslands of Earth, he had the primal urge to be still and silent, though through the vacuum, the creature wouldnt have heard him if hed shrieked.The creature shifted; the eerie eyes closed, opened again, closed; and then it leapt.The un twinkling stars were eclipsed by its passage.Clear, Prax said, shocked by the firmness of his voice.Its clear of the ship.Close the cargo doors now.Check, Naomi said.Closing doors.Im coming in, Capn, Amos said.Im passing out, Amos, Holden said, but there was enough laughter in the words that Prax was pretty sure he was joking.In the darkness, a star blinked out and then came back.Then another.Prax mentally traced the path.Another star eclipsed.Im heating her back up, Alex said.Let me know when youre all secure, right?Prax watched, waited.
