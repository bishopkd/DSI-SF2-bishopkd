A lot of the rest of them were there to witness this confrontation; Underhills main dining hall filled four chambers, whose dividing walls had been removed and replaced by load bearing pillars; it was a big room, filled with chairs and potted plants and the descendants of the Ares birds, and most recently lit by windows installed high across the northern wall, through which they saw the ground level crops of the atrium.A big space; and at least half the colonists were in it eating when the meeting took place.Why didnt you discuss this with us?Spencer asked her.Anns glare forced Spencer to look away.Why should I discuss it with you?she said, turning her gaze on Sax.Its clear what you all think about this, weve gone over it many times before, and nothing Ive said makes any difference to you.Here you sit in your little holes running your little experiments, making things like kids with a chemistry set in a basement, while the whole time an entire world sits outside your door.A world where the landforms are a hundred times larger than their equivalents on Earth, and a thousand times older, with evidence concerning the beginning of the solar system scattered all over, as well as the whole history of a planet, scarcely changed in the last billion years.And youre going to wreck it all.And without ever honestly admitting what youre doing, either.Because we could live here and study the planet without changing it we could do that with very little harm or even inconvenience to ourselves.All this talk of radiation is bullshit and you know it.Theres simply not a high enough level of it to justify this mass alteration of the environment.You want to do that because you think you can.You want to try it out and see as if this were some big playground sandbox for you to build castles in.A big Mars jar!You find your justifications where you can, but its bad faith, and its not science.Her face had gone bright red during this tirade; Nadia had never seen her anywhere near as angry as this.The usual matter of fact facade that she placed over her bitter anger had shattered, and she was almost speechless with fury, she was shuddering.The whole room had gone deadly quiet.Its not science, I say!Its just playing around.And for that game youre going to wreck the historical record, destroy the polar caps, and the outflow channels, and the canyon bottoms destroy a beautiful pure landscape, and for nothing at all.The room was as still as a tableau, they were like stone statues of themselves.The ventilators hummed.People began to eye one another warily.Simon took a step toward Ann, his hand outstretched; she stopped him dead with a glance, he might as well have stepped outside in his underwear and frozen stiff.His face reddened, and he cracked his posture and sat back down.Sax Russell rose to his feet.He looked the same as ever, perhaps a bit more flushed than usual, but mild, small, blinking owlishly, his voice calm and dry, as if lecturing on some textbook point of thermodynamics, or enumerating the periodic table.The beauty of Mars exists in the human mind, he said in that dry factual tone, and everyone stared at him amazed.Without the human presence it is just a collection of atoms, no different than any other random speck of matter in the universe.Its we who understand it, and we who give it meaning.All our centuries of looking up at the night sky and watching it wander through the stars.All those nights of watching it through the telescopes, looking at a tiny disk trying to see canals in the albedo changes.All those dumb sci fi novels with their monsters and maidens and dying civilizations.And all the scientists who studied the data, or got us here.Thats what makes Mars beautiful.Not the basalt and the oxides.He paused to look around at them all.Nadia gulped; it was strange in the extreme to hear these words come out of the mouth of Sax Russell, in the same dry tone that he would use to analyze a graph.Too strange!Now that we are here, he went on, it isnt enough to just hide under ten meters of soil and study the rock.Thats science, yes, and needed science too.But science is more than that.Science is part of a larger human enterprise, and that enterprise includes going to the stars, adapting to other planets, adapting them to us.Science is creation.The lack of life here, and the lack of any finding in fifty years of the SETI program, indicates that life is rare, and intelligent life even rarer.And yet the whole meaning of the universe, its beauty, is contained in the consciousness of intelligent life.We are the consciousness of the universe, and our job is to spread that around, to go look at things, to live everywhere we can.Its too dangerous to keep the consciousness of the universe on only one planet, it could be wiped out.And so now were on two, three if you count the moon.And we can change this one to make it safer to live on.Changing it wont destroy it.Reading its past might get harder, but the beauty of it wont go away.If there are lakes, or forests, or glaciers, how does that diminish Marss beauty?I dont think it does.I think it only enhances it.It adds life, the most beautiful system of all.But nothing life can do will bring Tharsis down, or fill Marineris.Mars will always remain Mars, different from Earth, colder and wilder.But it can be Mars and ours at the same time.And it will be.There is this about the human mind: if it can be done, it will be done.We can transform Mars and build it like you would build a cathedral, as a monument to humanity and the universe both.We can do it, so we will do it.So he held up a palm, as if satisfied that the analysis had been supported by the data in the graph as if he had examined the periodic table, and found that it still held truewe might as well start.He looked at Ann, and all eyes followed her.Anns mouth was tight, her shoulders slumped.She knew she was beaten.She shrugged, as if she were shrugging a hooded cape back over her head and body, a heavy carapace that weighed her down, and covered her entirely from them.In the flat dead tone that she usually employed when she was upset, she said, I think you value consciousness too high, and rock too little.We are not lords of the universe.Were one small part of it.We may be its consciousness, but being the consciousness of the universe does not mean turning it all into a mirror image of us.It means rather fitting into it as it is, and worshiping it with our attention.She met Saxs mild gaze, and one final flare of her anger jetted out: Youve never even seen Mars.And she left the room.Janet had had her camera specs on, and videotaped this exchange.Phyllis sent a copy back to Earth.A week later the UNOMA committee on environmental alterations approved the dissemination of the heater windmills.The plan was to drop them from dirigibles.Arkady immediately claimed the right to pilot one, as a sort of reward for his work on Phobos.Maya and Frank were not unhappy at the thought of Arkady disappearing from Underhill for another month or two, so they immediately assigned him one of the craft.He would drift east in the prevailing winds, descending to place windmills in channel beds and on the outer flanks of craters, both places where winds tended to be strong.Nadia first heard of the expedition when Arkady skipped through the chambers to her and told her about it.Sounds nice, she said.Want to come along?he asked.Why yes, she said.Her ghost finger was tingling.Their dirigible was the biggest ever made, a planetary model built back in Germany by Friedrichshafen Noch Einmal, and shipped up in 2029, so that it had just recently arrived.It was called the Arrowhead, and it measured 120 meters across the wings, a hundred meters front to back, and forty meters tall.It had an internal ultralite frame, and turboprops at each wingtip and under the gondola; these were driven by small plastic engines whose batteries were powered by solar cells arrayed on the upper surface of the bag.The pencil shaped gondola extended most of the length of the underside, but it was smaller inside than Nadia had expected, because much of it was temporarily filled with their cargo of windmills; at takeoff their clear space consisted of nothing more than the cockpit, two narrow beds, a tiny kitchen, an even smaller toilet, and the crawlspace necessary to move among these.It was pretty tight, but happily both sides of the gondola were walled with windows, and though somewhat blocked by windmills these still gave them a lot of light, and good visibility.Takeoff was slow.Arkady released the lines extending from the three mooring masts with the flip of a cockpit toggle; the turboprops ran hard, but they were dealing with air that was only twelve millibars thick.The cockpit bounced up and down in slow motion, flexing with the internal frame: and every up bounce was a little higher off the ground.For someone used to rocket launches it was comical.Lets take a three sixty and see Underhill before we go, Arkady said when they were fifty meters high.He banked the ship and they made a slow wide turn, looking out Nadias window.Tracks, pits, mounds of regolith, all dark red against the dusty orange surface of the plain it looked as if a dragon had reached down with a great taloned claw, and drawn blood time after time.Underhill sat at the center of the wounds, and by itself was a pretty sight, a square dark red setting for a shiny glass and silver jewel, with green just visible under the dome.Extending away from it were the roads east to Chernobyl and north to the spacepads.And over there were the long bulbs of the greenhouses, and there was the trailer park  The Alchemists Quarter still looks like something out of the Urals, Arkady said.We really have to do something about that.He brought the dirigible out of its turn and headed east, moving with the wind.Should I run us over Chernobyl and catch the updraft?Why dont we see what this thing can do unassisted, Nadia said.She felt light, as if the hydrogen in the ballonets had filled her as well.The view was stupendous, the hazy horizon perhaps a hundred kilometers away, the contours of the land all clearly visible the subtle bumps and hollows of Lunae, the more prominent hills and canyons of the channeled terrain to the east.Oh, this is going to be wonderful!Yes.It was remarkable, in fact, that they had not done anything like this before.But flying on Mars was no easy thing, because of the thin atmosphere.They were in the best solution: a dirigible as big and light as possible, filled with hydrogen, which in Martian air was not only not flammable, but also even lighter relative to its surroundings than it would have been on Earth.Hydrogen and the latest in superlight materials gave them the lift to carry a cargo like their windmills, but with such a cargo aboard they were ludicrously sluggish.And so they drifted along.All that day they crossed the rolling plain of Lunae Planum, pushed southeast by the wind.For an hour or two they could see Juventa Chasm on the southern horizon, a gash of a canyon that looked like a giant pit mine.Farther east the land turned yellowish; there was less surface rubble, and the underlying bedrock was more rumpled.There were also many more craters, craters big and small, crisp rimmed or nearly buried.This was Xanthe Terra, a high region that was topographically similar to the southern uplands, here sticking into the north between the low plains of Chryse and Isidis.They would be over Xanthe for some days, if the prevailing westerlies held true.They were progressing at a leisurely ten kilometers per hour.Most of the time they flew at an altitude of about a hundred meters, which put the horizons about fifty kilometers away.They had time to look closely at anything they wanted to, although Xanthe was proving to be little more than a steady succession of craters.Late that afternoon Nadia tilted the nose of the dirigible down and circled into the wind, dropping until they were within ten meters of the ground and then releasing their anchor.The ship rose, jerked on its line, and settled downwind of the anchor, tugging at it like a fat kite.Nadia and Arkady twisted down the length of the gondola, to what Arkady called the bomb bay.Nadia lifted a windmill onto the bays winch hook.The windmill was a little thing, a magnesium box with four vertical vanes on a rod projecting from its top.It weighed about five kilos.They closed the bay door on it, sucked out the air, and opened the bottom doors.Arkady operated the winch, looking through a low window to see what he was doing.The windmill dropped like a plumb and bumped onto hardened sand, on the southern flank of a small unnamed crater.He released the winch hook and reeled it back into the bay, and closed the bomb doors.They returned to the cockpit, and looked down again to see if the windmill was working.There it stood, a small box on the outside slope of a crater, somewhat tilted, the four broad vertical blades spinning merrily.It looked like an anemometer from a kids meteorology kit.The heating element, an exposed metal coil that would radiate like a stovetop, was on one side of the base.In a good wind the element might get up to 200 degrees Centigrade, which wasnt bad, especially in that ambient temperature.Still ...Its going to take a lot of those to make any difference, Nadia remarked.Sure, but every little bit helps, and in a way its free heat.Not only the wind powering the heaters, but the sun powering the factories making the windmills.I think theyre a good idea.They stopped once more that afternoon to set out another one, then anchored for the night in the lee of a crisp young crater.They microwaved a meal in the tiny kitchen, and then retired to their narrow bunks.It felt odd to rock on the wind, like a boat at its mooring: tug and float, tug and float.But it was very relaxing when you got used to it, and soon Nadia was asleep.The next morning they woke before dawn, cast off, and motored up into the sunlight.From a hundred meters height they could watch the shadowed landscape below turn to bronze as the terminator rolled by and clear daylight followed, illuminating a fantastic jumble of bright rocks and long shadows.The morning wind ran right to left across their bow, so they were pushed northeast toward Chryse, humming along with the props on full power.Then the land fell away below them, and they were over the first of the outflow channels they would pass, a sinuous unnamed valley west of Shalbatana Vallis.This little arroyos S shape was unmistakably water cut.Later that day they lofted out over the deeper and much wider canyon of Shalbatana, and the signs were even more obvious: tear shaped islands, curving channels, alluvial plains, scablands; there were signs everywhere of a massive flood, a flood that had created a canyon so huge that the Arrowhead suddenly looked like a butterfly.The outflow canyons and the high land between them reminded Nadia of the landscape of American cowboy movies, with washes and mesas and isolated ship rocks, as in Monument Valley except here it lasted for four days, as they passed in succession over the unnamed channel, Shalbatana, Simud, Tiu, and then Ares.And all of them had been caused by giant floods, which had burst onto the surface and flowed for months, at rates 10,000 times that of the Mississippi.Nadia and Arkady talked about that as they looked down into the canyons under them, but it was very hard to imagine floods so huge.Now the big empty canyons funneled nothing but wind.They did that quite well, however, so Arkady and Nadia descended into them a number of times per day, to drop more windmills.Then east of Ares Vallis they floated back over the densely cratered terrain of Xanthe.Again the land was everywhere marred by craters: big craters, little craters, old craters, new craters, craters with rims marred by newer craters, craters with floors punctured by three or five smaller craters; craters as fresh as if they had been struck yesterday, craters that just barely showed, at dawn and dusk, as buried arcs in the old plateau.They passed over Schiaparelli, a giant old crater a hundred kilometers across.When they floated over its central uplift knob, its crater walls formed their horizon, a perfect ring of hills around the edge of the world.After that winds blew from the south for several days.They caught a glimpse of Cassini, another great old crater, and passed over hundreds of smaller ones.They dropped several windmills per day, but the flight was giving them a stronger sense of the size of the planet, and the project began to seem like a joke, as if they flew over Antarctica and tried to melt the ice by setting down a number of camping stoves.Youd have to drop millions to make any difference, Nadia said as they climbed up from another drop.True, Arkady said.But Sax would like to drop millions.Hes got an automated assembly line that will just keep churning them out, its only distribution that is a problem.And besides, its just one part of the campaign he has in mind.He gestured back toward the last arc of Cassini, inscribing the whole northwest.Sax would like to bang out a few more holes like that one.Capture some icy moonlets from Saturn, or from the asteroid belt if he can find any, and push them back and smash them into Mars.Make hot craters, melt the permafrost theyd be like oases.Dry oases, wouldnt they be?Youd lose most of the ice on entry, and have the rest disappear on contact.Sure, but we can use more water vapor in the air.But it wouldnt just vaporize, it would break into its constituent atoms.Some of it.But hydrogen and oxygen, we could use more of both.So youre bringing hydrogen and oxygen from Saturn?Come on, theres lots of both here already!You could just break down some of the ice.Well, its just one of his ideas.I cant wait to hear what Ann says to that.She sighed, thought about it.The thing to do, I suppose, would be to graze an ice asteroid through the atmosphere, as if trying to aerobrake it.That would burn it up without breaking the molecules apart.Youd get water vapor in the atmosphere, which would help, but you wouldnt be bombing the surface with explosions as big as a hundred hydrogen bombs going off all at once.Arkady nodded.Good idea!You should tell Sax.You tell him.East of Cassini the terrain grew rougher than ever.This was some of the oldest surface on the planet, cratered to saturation in the earliest years of torrential bombardment.A hellish age, the Noachian, you could see that in the landscape.No Mans Land from a titanic trench war, the sight of it induced a kind of numbness after a while, a cosmological shell shock.They floated on, east, northeast, southeast, south, northeast, west, east, east.They finally came to the end of Xanthe, and began to descend the long slope of Syrtis Major Planitia.This was a lava plain, much less densely cratered than Xanthe.The land sloped down and down, until finally they drifted over a smooth floored basin: Isidis Planitia, one of the lowest points on Mars.It was the essence of the northern hemisphere, and after the southern highlands it seemed especially smooth and flat and low.And it too was a very large region.There really was a lot of land on Mars.Then one morning when they lofted up to cruising altitude, a trio of peaks rose over the eastern horizon.They had come to Elysium, the only other Tharsislike bulge continent that the planet had.Elysium was a much smaller bulge than Tharsis, but it was still big, a high continent, 1,000 kilometers long and ten kilometers taller than the surrounding terrain.As with Tharsis, it was ringed by patches of fractured land, crack systems caused by the uplift.They flew over the westernmost of these crack systems, Hephaestus Fossae, and found the area an unearthly sight: five long deep parallel canyons, like claw marks in the bedrock.Elysium loomed beyond, a saddleback in shape, Elysium Mons and Hecates Tholus rearing at each end of a long spine range, 5,000 meters higher than the bulge they punctuated: an awesome sight.Everything about Elysium was so much bigger than anything Nadia and Arkady had seen so far that as the dirigible floated toward the range, the two were speechless for minutes at a time.They sat in their seats, watching it all float slowly toward them.When they did speak, it was just thinking aloud: Looks like the Karakoram, Arkady said.Desert Himalayas.Except these are so simple.Those volcanoes look like Fuji.Maybe people will hike up them someday in pilgrimages.Nadia said, These are so big, its hard to imagine what the Tharsis volcanoes will look like.Arent the Tharsis volcanoes twice as big as these?At least.It does look like Fuji, dont you think?No, its a lot less steep.Why, did you ever see Fuji?No.After a while: Well, wed better try to go around the whole damn thing, Arkady said.Im not sure we have the loft to get over those mountains.So they turned the props and pushed south as hard as they could, and the winds naturally cooperated, as they were curving around the continent too.So the Arrowhead floated southeast into a rough mountainous region called Cerberus, and all of the next day they could mark their progress by the sight of Elysium, passing slowly to their left.Hours passed, the massif shifted in their side windows; the slowness of the shift made it plain just how big this world was.Mars has as much land surface as the Earth everyone always said that, but it had been just a phrase.Their creep around Elysium was the proof of the senses.The days passed: up in the frigid morning air, over the jumbled red land, down in the sunset, to bounce at an airy anchorage.One evening when the supply of windmills had dwindled they rearranged those that remained, and moved their beds together under the starboard windows.They did it without discussion, as if it had been the obvious thing to do when they had room; as if they had already agreed to do it long before.And as they moved around the cramped gondola rearranging things, they bumped into each other just as they had all trip long, but now intentionally, and with a sensuous rubbing which accentuated what they had been up to all along, accidents become foreplay; and finally Arkady burst out laughing and caught her up into a wild bear hug, and Nadia shouldered him back onto their new double bed and they kissed like teenagers, and made love through the night.And after that they slept together, and made love frequently in the ruddy glow of dawn and in the starry black nights, with the ship lightly bobbing at its moorings.And they lay together talking, and the sensation of floating as they embraced was palpable, more romantic than any train or ship.We became friends first, Arkady said once, thats what makes this different, dont you think?He prodded her with a finger.I love you.It was as if he were testing the words with his tongue.It was clear to Nadia that he hadnt said them often; it was clear they meant a lot to him, a kind of commitment.Ideas meant so much to him!And I love you, she said.And in the mornings Arkady would pad up and down the narrow gondola naked, his red hair bronzed like everything else by the horizontal morning light, and Nadia would watch from their bed feeling so serene and happy that she had to remind herself that the floating sensation was probably just Martian g.  But it felt like joy.One night as they were falling asleep Nadia said curiously, Why me?Huhn?He had been almost asleep.I said, why me?I mean, Arkady Nikelyovich, you could have loved any of the women here, and they would have loved you back.You could have had Maya if you wanted.He snorted.I could have had Maya!Oh my!I could have had the joy of Maya Katarina!Just like Frank and John!He snorted, and they both laughed out loud.How could I have passed on such joy!Silly me!He giggled until she punched him.All right, all right.One of the others then, the beautiful ones, Janet or Ursula or Samantha.Come on, he said.He propped himself up on an elbow to look at her.You really dont know what beauty is, do you?I certainly do, Nadia said mulishly.Arkady ignored her and said, Beauty is power and elegance, right action, form fitting function, intelligence, and reasonability.And very often, he grinned and pushed at her belly, expressed in curves.Curves Ive got, Nadia said, pushing his hand away.He leaned forward and tried to bite her breast, but she dodged him.Beauty is what you are, Nadezhda Francine.By these criteria you are queen of Mars.Princess of Mars, she corrected absently, thinking it over.Yes thats right.Nadezhda Francine Cherneshevsky, the nine fingered Princess of Mars.Youre not a conventional man.No!He hooted.I never claimed to be!Except before certain selection committees of course.A conventional man!Ah, ha ha ha ha ha!the conventional men get Maya.That is their reward.And he laughed like a wild man.One morning they crossed the last broken hills of Cerberus, and floated out over the flat dusty plain of Amazonis Planitia.Arkady brought the dirigible down, to set a windmill in a pass between two final hillocks of old Cerberus.Something went wrong with the clasp on the winch hook, however, and it snapped open when the windmill was only halfway to the ground.The windmill thumped down flat on its base.From the ship it looked okay, but when Nadia suited up and descended in the sling to check it out, she found that the hot plate had cracked away from the base.And there, behind the plate, was a mass of something.A dull green something with a touch of blue to it, dark inside the box.She reached in with a screwdriver and poked at it carefully.Shit, she said.What?Arkady said above.She ignored him and scraped some of the substance into a bag she used for screws and nuts.She got into the sling.Pull me back up, she ordered.Whats wrong?Arkady asked.Just get me up there.He closed the bomb bay doors after her, and met her as she was getting out of the sling.Whats up?She took off her helmet.You know whats up, you bastard!She took a swing at him and he leaped back, banging into a wall of windmills.Ow!he cried; a vane had caught him in the back.Hey!Whats the problem!Nadia!She took the bag from her walker pocket and waved it before him.This is the problem!How could you do it?How could you lie to me?You bastard, do you have any idea what kind of trouble this is going to get us in?Theyll come up here and send us all back to Earth!Round eyed, Arkady rubbed his jaw.I wouldnt lie to you, Nadia, he said earnestly.I dont lie to my friends.Let me see that.She stared at him and he stared back, his arm stretched out for the bag, the whites of his eyes visible all the way round the irises.He shrugged, and she frowned.You really dont know?she demanded.Know what?What?She couldnt believe he would fake ignorance; it just wasnt his style.Which suddenly made things very strange.At least some of our windmills are little algae farms.The fucking windmills that weve been dropping everywhere, she said.Theyre stuffed with Vlads new algae or lichen or whatever it is.Look.She put the little bag on the tiny kitchen table, opened it, and used the screwdriver to spoon out a little bit of it.Little knobby chunks of bluish lichen.Like Martian life forms out of an old pulp novel.They stared at it.Well Ill be damned, Arkady said.He leaned over until his eyes were a centimeter from the stuff on the table.You swear you didnt know?Nadia demanded.I swear.I wouldnt do that to you, Nadia.You know that.She heaved a big breath.Well our friends would do it to us, apparently.He straightened up and nodded.Thats right.He was distracted, thinking hard.He went to one of the windmill bases and hefted it away from the others.Where was it?Behind the heating pad.They went to work on it with Nadias tools, and got it open.Behind the plate was another colony of Underhill algae.Nadia poked around at the edges of the plate and discovered a pair of small hinges where the top of the plate met the inside of the container wall.Look, its made to open.But who opens it?Arkady said.Radio?Well Ill be damned.Arkady stood, walked up and down the narrow corridor.I mean ...How many dirigible trips have been made so far, ten?Twenty?And all of them dropping these things?Arkady started to laugh.He tilted his head back, and his huge crazed grin split his red beard in two, and he laughed until he held his sides.Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha!Nadia, who didnt think it was funny at all, nevertheless felt her face grinning at the sight of him.Its not funny!she protested.Were in big trouble!Maybe, he said.Definitely!And its all your fault!Some of those fool biologists in the trailer park took your anarchist rant seriously!Well, he said, that at least is a point in their favor, the bastards.I mean he went back to the kitchen table to stare at the clump of blue stuffwho exactly do you think were talking about, anyway?How many of our friends are in on this?And why in the world didnt they tell me?This really rankled, she could tell.In fact the more he thought about it, the less amused he was, because the algae meant there was a subculture in their group that was acting outside UNOMA supervision but had not let Arkady in on it, even though he had been the first and most vocal advocate of such subversion.What did that mean?Were there people who were on his side but didnt trust him?Were there dissidents with a competing program?They had no way of telling.Eventually they pulled anchor, and sailed on over Amazonis.They passed a medium sized crater named Pettit, and Arkady remarked that it would make a good site for a windmill, but Nadia only snarled.They flew by, talking the situation over.Certainly several people in the bioengineering labs had to be in on it; probably most of them; maybe all.And then Sax, the designer of the windmills, certainly had to be a part of it.And Hiroko had been an advocate of the windmills, but they had neither been sure why it was impossible to judge whether she would approve of something like this or not, as she was simply too close with her opinions.But it was possible.As they talked it over, they took the broken windmill completely apart.The heating plate doubled as a gate for the compartment containing the algae; when the gate opened, the algae would be released into an area that would be a bit warmer because of the hot plate itself.Each windmill thus functioned as a micro oasis, and if the algae managed to survive with its help, and then grow beyond the small area warmed by the hot plate, then good.If not it was not going to do very well on Mars anyway.The hot plate served to give it a good sendoff, nothing more.Or so its designers must have thought.Weve been made into Johnny Appleseed, Arkady said.Johnny what?American folktale.He told her about it.Yeah, right.And now Paul Bunyan is going to come kick our ass.Ha.Never.Big Man is much bigger than Paul Bunyan, believe me.Big Man?You know, all those names for landscape features.Big Mans Footprints, Big Mans Bathtub, Big Mans Golf Course, whatever.Ah yeah.Anyway, I dont see why we should get in trouble.We didnt know anything about it.Now whos going to believe that?...Good point.Those bastards, they really got me with this one.Clearly this was what bothered Arkady most.Not that they had contaminated Mars with alien biota, but that he had been kept out of a secret.Men were such egomaniacs when it came down to it.And Arkady, he had his own group of friends, perhaps more than that: people who agreed with him, followers of a sort.The whole Phobos crew, a lot of the programmers in Underhill.And if some of his own people were keeping things from him, that was bad; but if another group had secret plans of its own, that was worse, apparently, because they were at least interference, and perhaps competition.Or so he seemed to think.He wouldnt say much of this explicitly, but it became obvious in his mutterings, and his sudden sharp curses, which were genuine even though they alternated with bursts of hilarity.He couldnt seem to make up his mind whether he was pleased or angry, and Nadia finally believed that he was both at once.That was Arkady; he felt things freely and to the full, and wasnt much worried about consistency.But she wasnt too sure she liked his reasons this time, for either his anger or his amusement, and she told him so with considerable irritation.Well, but come on!he cried.Why should they keep it a secret from me, when it was my idea to begin with?Because they knew I might come along with you.If they told you, you would have had to tell me.And if you told me, I would have stopped it!Arkady laughed outrageously at this.So it was pretty considerate of them after all!Fuck.The bioengineers, Sax, the people in the Quarter who had actually constructed the things.Someone in communications, probably ...there were quite a few who must have known.What about Hiroko?Arkady asked.They couldnt decide.They didnt know enough of her views to be able to guess what she might think.Nadia was pretty sure she was in on it, but couldnt explain why.I suppose, she said, thinking about it, I suppose I feel like there is this group around Hiroko, the whole farm team and a fair number of others, who respect her and ...follow her.Even Ann, in a way.Although Ann will hate this when she hears about it!Whew!Anyway, it just seems to me that Hiroko would know about anything secret going on.Especially something having to do with ecological systems.The bioengineering group works with her most of the time, after all, and for some of them shes like a guru, they almost worship her.They probably got her advice when they were splicing this algae together!Hmm....So they probably got her agreement for the idea.Maybe I should even say her permission.Arkady nodded.I see your point.On and on they talked, hashing over every point of it.The land they passed over, flat and immobile, looked different to Nadia now.It was seeded, fertilized; it was going to change, now, inevitably.They talked about the other parts of Saxs terraforming plans, giant orbiting mirrors reflecting sunlight onto the dawn and dusk terminators, carbon distributed over the polar caps, areothermal heat, the ice asteroids.It was all really going to happen, it seemed.The debate had been bypassed; they were going to change the face of Mars.The second evening after their momentous discovery, as they were cooking dinner in a craters lee anchorage, they got a call from Underhill, relayed off one of the comm satellites.Hey you two!John Boone said by way of greeting.Weve got a problem!Youve got a problem, Nadia replied.Why, something wrong out there?No no.Well good, because really its you guys who have the problem, and I wouldnt want you to have more than one!A dust storm has started down in the Claritas Fossae region, and its growing, and coming north at a good rate.We think itll reach you in a day or so.Isnt it early for dust storms?Arkady asked.Well no, were at Ls = 240, which is pretty much the usual season for it.Southern spring.Anyway, there it is, and its coming your way.He sent a satellite photo of the storm, and they studied their TV screen closely.The region south of Tharsis was now obscured by an amorphous yellow cloud.Wed better take off for home right now, Nadia said after studying the photo.At night?We can run the props on batteries tonight, and recharge the batteries tomorrow morning.After that we may not have much sunlight, unless we can get above the dust.After some discussion with John, and then with Ann, they cast off.The wind was pushing them east northeast, and on this heading they would pass just to the south of Olympus Mons.After that their hope was to get around the north flank of Tharsis, which would protect them from the dust storm for at least a while.It seemed louder flying at night.The winds rush over the fabric of the bag was a fluctuating moan, the sound of their engines a pitiful little hum.They sat in the cockpit, lit only by dim green instrument lights, and talked in low voices as they moved over the black land below.They had about 3,000 kilometers to go before reaching Underhill; that was about 300 hours of flying time.If they went round the clock, it would be twelve days or so.But the storm, if it grew in the usual pattern, would reach them long before then.After that ...it was hard to tell how it would go.Without sunlight the props would drain the batteries, and thenCan we just float on the wind?Nadia said.Use the props for occasional directional nudges?Maybe.But these things are designed with the props as part of the lift, you know.Yeah.She made coffee and brought mugs of it up to the cockpit.They sat and drank, and looked out at the black landscape, or the green sweep of the little radar screen.We probably ought to drop everything we dont need.Especially those damned windmills.Its all ballast, save it for when we need the lift.The hours of the night wore on.They traded shifts at the helm, and Nadia caught an uneasy hours sleep.When she returned to the cockpit, she saw that the black bulk of Tharsis had rolled over the horizon ahead of them: the two northernmost of the three prince volcanoes, Ascraeus Mons and Pavonis Mons, were visible as humps of occluded stars, out at the edge of the world.To their left Olympus Mons still bulked well above the horizon, and taken with the other two volcanoes, it looked as if they flew low in some truly gigantic canyon.The radar screen reproduced the view in miniature, in green lines on the screens gridwork.Then, in the hour before dawn, it seemed as though another massive volcano were rising behind them.The whole southern horizon was lifting, low stars disappearing as they watched, Orion drowned in black.The storm was coming.It caught them just at daybreak, choking off the red in the eastern sky, rolling over them, returning the world to rusty darkness.The wind picked up until it swept them along in a muted roar from the land below.The view out the windows was of a few meters of swirling yellow dust, like a close up of the clouds of Jupiter.Eddies twisted the dirigibles frame and the gondola trembled and bounced.They were lucky north was the direction they wanted to go.At one point Arkady said, The wind should hopefully wrap around the north shoulder of Tharsis.Nadia nodded silently.They hadnt gotten the chance to recharge the batteries after the nights flight, and without sunlight the motors wouldnt run too much longer.Hiroko told me sunlight on the ground during a storm is supposed to be about fifteen percent of normal, she said.Higher there should be more.So well get some recharge, but itll be slow.Could be that over the course of the day we might get enough to use the props a bit tonight.She flicked on a computer to do the calculations.Something in the expression on Arkadys face not fear, not even anxiety, but a curious little smile made her aware of how much danger they were in.If they couldnt use the props, they wouldnt be able to direct their movement, and they might not even be able to stay aloft.They could descend, it was true, and try to anchor, but they had only a few weeks more food, and storms like these often persisted for two months, sometimes three.Theres Ascraeus Mons, Arkady said, pointing at the radar screen.Good image.He laughed.Best view of it were going to get this time around, Im afraid.Too bad, I was really looking forward to seeing them!Remember Elysium?Yeah yeah, Nadia said, busy running simulations of the batteries efficiency.Daily sunlight was near its perihelion peak, which was why the storm had started in the first place; and the instruments said that about 20 percent of full daylight was penetrating to this level (it felt to her eye more like 30 or 40); therefore it might be possible to run the props half the time, which would help tremendously.Without them they were losing altitude although that might just be the ground rising under them.With the props they might be able to hold a steady altitude, and influence their course by a degree or two.How thick is this dust, do you think?How thick?You know, grams per cubic meter.Try to get Ann or Hiroko on the radio and find out, will you?She went back to see what they had on board that could be used to power the props.Hydrazine, for the bomb bay vacuum pumps; the pump motors could be wired to the props, probably.Then there were spare solar panels, and the solar panels in the emergency kit.If she could get them outside she could run whatever extra insolation they caught into the prop batteries.Also, in a sandstorm like this there was light coming from all directions, so some should probably be pointed down.As she rooted through the equipment locker looking for wire and transformer sand tools she told Arkady the idea, and he laughed his madman laugh.Good idea, Nadia!Great idea.If it works.She rummaged through the tool kit, sadly smaller than her usual supply.The light in the gondola was eerie, a dim yellow glow flickering with every gust.The view out the side windows shifted from pockets of complete clarity, with thick yellow clouds like thunderheads sailing north with them, to complete obscurity, all the window surfaces streaming with dust that wormed and spun like a particularly unpleasant screensaver.Even at twelve millibars the blast of the wind was tossing the dirigible about; up in the cockpit Arkady was cursing the autopilots insufficiency.Reprogram it, Nadia called forward, and then remembered all his sadistic simulations on the Ares, and laughed out loud: Problem run!Problem run!She laughed again at his shouted curses, and went back to work.Arkady yelled back information from Ann.The dust was extremely fine, average particle size about 2.5 microns; total column mass about 1 3 grams per cm 2, pretty evenly distributed from top to bottom of the column.That wasnt so bad; drop it on the ground and it would be a really thin layer, which was consistent with what they had seen on the oldest freight drops at Underhill.When she had prepped all the solar panels she banged down the passageway to the cockpit.Ann says the winds will be slowest close to the ground, Arkady said.Good.We need to land to get the panels outside.So that afternoon they descended blind, and let the anchor drag until it hooked and held.The wind here was slower, but even so Nadias descent in the sling was harrowing.Down and down into rushing clouds of yellow dust, swinging back and forth ...and there it was right under her boots, the ground!She hit and dragged to a halt.Once out of the sling she found herself leaning into the wind; thin as it was it still struck like blows, and her old feeling of hollowness was extreme.Visibility billowed back and forth in waves, and the dust flew past so fast it was disorienting on Earth a wind that fast would simply pick you up and throw you, like a broom straw in a tornado.But here you could hold your ground, if only just.Arkady had been slowly winching the dirigible down on the anchor line, and now it bulked over her like a green roof.It was weirdly dark underneath it.She unreeled the wires out to the wingtip turboprops, taped them to the dirigible and crimped them to the contacts inside, working fast to try to reduce their exposure to dust, and to get out from under the Arrowhead, which was bouncing on the wind.With difficulty she drilled holes in the bottom of the gondola fuselage, and attached ten solar panels with screws.As she was taping the wiring from these to the plastic fuselage, the whole dirigible dropped so fast that she had to collapse onto her face, her whole body spread eagled on the cold ground, the drill a hard lump under her stomach.Shit!she shouted.Whats wrong?Arkady cried over the intercom.Nothing, she said, jumping up and taping faster than ever.Fucking thing its like working on a trampoline Then as she was finishing the wind picked up strength yet again, and she had to crawl back down to the bomb bay, her breath rasping in and out of her.The damn thing almost crushed me!she shouted forward to Arkady when she had her helmet off.While he worked to unhook the anchor she staggered around the interior of the gondola, picking up things that they wouldnt need and taking them into the bomb bay: a lamp, one of the mattresses, most of the cooking utensils and dinnerware, some books, all the rock samples.In they went, and she jettisoned them happily.If some traveler ever came upon the resulting pile of stuff, she thought, they would really wonder what the hell had happened.They had to run both props full out to get the anchor unhooked, and when they succeeded they were off and flying like a leaf in November.They kept the props on full, to gain altitude as fast as possible; there were some small volcanoes between Olympus and Tharsis, and Arkady wanted to pass several hundred meters over them.The radar screen showed Ascraeus Mons falling steadily behind.When they were well north of it they could turn east, and try to chart a course around the northern flank of Tharsis, and then down to Underhill.But as the long hours passed they found that the wind was rushing down the north slope of Tharsis, across their bow, so that even when running full power toward the southeast, they were still only moving northeast at best.In their attempts to fly across the wind the poor Arrowhead was bouncing like a hang glider, yanking them up and down, up and down, up and down, as if the gondola were indeed attached to the underside of a trampoline.But despite all that, they still werent going in the direction they wanted to go.Darkness fell again.They were carried farther northeast.On this heading, they were going to miss Underhill by several hundred kilometers.After that, nothing; no settlements at all, no refuge.They would be blown over Acidalia, up onto Vastitas Borealis, up to the empty petrified sea of black dunes.And they did not have enough food and water to circumnavigate the planet again and give it another try.Feeling dust in her mouth and eyes, Nadia went back to the kitchen and heated them a meal.Already she was exhausted, and, she realized as the smell of food filled the air, extremely hungry.Thirsty, too, and the water recycler ran on hydrazine.Thinking about water, an image came to her mind, from the trip to the north pole: that broken permafrost gallery, with its white spill of water ice.Now how was that relevant?She worked her way back up to the cockpit, holding onto a wall with every step.She ate a dusty meal with Arkady, trying to figure it out.Arkady watched their radar screen, saying nothing, but he was looking concerned.Ah.Look, she said, if we could pick up the signals from the transponders on our road to Chasma Borealis, we could come down and land by it.Then one of the robot rovers could be sent up to get us.The storm wont matter to the robot rovers, they dont go by sight anyway.We could leave the Arrowhead tethered, and drive back home.Arkady looked at her, finished swallowing.Good idea, he said.But only if they could actually pick up the roads transponder signals.Arkady flicked on the radio and called Underhill.The connection crackled in a storm of static almost as dense as the dust, but they could still make themselves understood.All through that night they conferred with the crowd back home, discussing frequencies, bandwidths, the power of the dust to mask the transponders fairly weak signals, and so on.Because the transponders were designed only to signal rovers that were nearby and on the ground, it was going to be a problem hearing them.Underhill might be able to pinpoint their location well enough to tell them when to descend, and their own radar map would give them a general fix on the roads location as well; but neither of these methods would be very exact, and it would be almost impossible to find the road in the storm if they didnt land right on it.Ten kilometers either way and it would be over the horizon, and they would be out of luck.It would be a lot more certain if they could just latch onto one of the transponder signals, and follow it down.In any case, Underhill dispatched a robot rover on the road north.It would arrive in the area of the road they were expected to cross in about five days; at their current speed they would cross the road themselves in about four days.When the arrangements were finished, they traded watches through the rest of the night.Nadia slept uneasily on her off watches, and spent much of the time lying on the bed feeling the wind bounce her.The windows were as dark as if curtains had been drawn.The roar of the wind was like a gas stove, and then occasionally like banshees; once she dreamed they were inside a great furnace full of flame demons, and woke sweating, and went forward to relieve Arkady.The whole gondola smelled of sweat and dust and burnt hydrazine.Despite all the gaskets micron seals, there was a visible whitish film on all the surfaces inside the gondola.She wiped her fingers across a pale blue plastic bulkhead, and stared at her fingers mark.Incredible.They bounded along through the gloom of the days, through the starless black of the nights.The radar showed what they thought was Fesenkov Crater, running under them; they were being carried northeast still, and there was absolutely no chance they would be able to buck the storm and get south to Underhill.The polar road was their only hope.Nadia occupied her off watches by looking for things to throw overboard, and cutting away at parts of the gondola frame she judged inessential, until the engineers in Friedrichshafen would have shuddered.But Germans always overengineered things, and no one on Earth could ever really believe in Martian g anyway.So she sawed and hammered until everything inside the gondola was latticed nearly to nothing.Every use of the bay brought in another small cloud of dust, but she figured it was worth it; they needed the loft, her solar panel arrangement was not getting sufficient power to the batteries, and she had tossed everything not attached to the hull long before.Even if she had had them, she would not have gone back under the dirigible to install them; the memory of the incident still gave her the shivers.Instead she kept cutting further and further.She would have tossed out pieces of the dirigible frame too, if she could have gotten into the ballonets.While she did this Arkady padded around the gondola cheering her on, naked and dust caked, the red man incarnate, singing songs and watching the radar screen, jamming down quick meals, planning their course such as it was.It was impossible not to catch a bit of his exhilaration, to marvel with him at the strongest buffets of the wind, to feel the dust flying wild in her blood.And so three long intense days passed, in the grip of the dark orange wind.And on the fourth day, a bit after noon, they turned the radio receiver up to full volume, and listened to the crackly roar of static at the transponders frequency.Concentrating on the white noise made Nadia drowsy, for they had had very little sleep; she was almost unconscious when Arkady said something, and she jerked up in her seat.Hear it?he asked again.She listened, and shook her head.There, its a kind of ping.She heard a little bip.Is that it?I think so.Im going to get us down as fast as I can, Ill have to empty some of the ballonets.He tapped away at the control keyboard, and the dirigible tilted forward and they began to drop at emergency speed.The altimeters numbers flickered down.The radar screen showed the ground below to be basically flat.The ping got louder and louder without a directional receiver, that was going to be their only way to tell if they were still approaching it or moving away.Ping ping ping In her exhaustion it was hard to tell whether it was getting louder or softer, and it seemed every beep was a different volume, depending on the attention she could bring to bear.Its getting softer, Arkady said suddenly.Dont you think?I cant tell.It is.He switched on the props, and with the whir of the motors the signal definitely seemed quieter.He turned into the wind, and the dirigible bounced wildly; he fought to steady its downward movement, but there was a delay between every shift of the flaps and the dirigibles bucking, and in reality they were in little more than a controlled crash.The ping was perhaps getting softer at a slower rate.When the altimeter indicated they were low enough to drop the anchor they did so, and after an anxious bit of drifting it caught, and held.They dropped all the anchors they had, and pulled the Arrowhead down on the lines.Then Nadia suited up and climbed into the sling and winched down, and once on the surface she began walking around in a chocolate dawn, leaning hard into the irregular torrent of wind.She found she was more physically exhausted than she could ever remember being, it was really hard to make headway upwind, she had to tack.Over her intercom the transponder signal pinged, and the ground seemed to bounce under her feet; it was hard to keep her balance.The ping was quite distinct.We should have been listening on our helmet intercoms all along, she said to Arkady.You can hear better.A gust knocked her over.She got up and shuffled slowly along, letting out a nylon line behind her, adjusting her course as she followed the volume of the pings.The ground flowed underfoot, when she could see it; visibility was actually down to a meter or less, at least in the thickest gusts.Then it would clear a touch and brown jets of dust would flash by, sheet after sheet, moving at an awesome speed.The wind buffeted her as hard as anything she had ever felt on Earth, or harder; it was painful work to keep her balance, a constant physical effort.While inside a thick, blinding cloud, she nearly shuffled right into one of the transponders, standing there like a fat fence post.Hey!she shouted.Whats wrong?Nothing!I scared myself running into the roadmark.You found it!Yeah.She felt her exhaustion run down into her hands and feet.She sat on the ground for a minute, then stood again; it was too cold to sit.Her ghost finger hurt.She took up the nylon line and returned blindly to the dirigible, feeling she had wandered into the ancient myth, and was following the only thread out of the labyrinth.During their rover trip south, blind in the flying dust, word came crackling over the radio that UNOMA had just approved and funded the establishment of three follow up colonies.Each would consist of 500 people, all to be from countries not represented in the first hundred.And the subcommittee on terraforming had recommended, and the General Assembly approved, a whole package of terraforming efforts, among them the distribution on the surface of genetically engineered microorganisms constructed from parent stock such as algaes, bacteria, or lichens.Arkady laughed for a good thirty seconds.Those bastards, those lucky bastards!Theyre going to get away with it.Part 4    Homesick      One winter morning the sun shines down on Valles Marineris, illuminating the north walls of all the canyons in that great concatenation of canyons.And in that bright light one can see that here and there a ledge or outcropping is touched by a warty speck of black lichen.Life adapts, you see.It has only a few needs, some fuel, some energy; and it is fantastically ingenious at extracting these needs from a wide range of Terran environments.Some organisms live always below the freezing point of water, others above the boiling point; some live in high radiation zones, others in intensely salty regions, or within solid rock, or in pitch black, or in extreme dehydration, or without oxygen.All kinds of environments are accommodated, by adaptive measures so strange and marvelous they are beyond our capacity to imagine; and so from the bedrock to high in the atmosphere, life has permeated the Earth with the full weave of one great biosphere.All these adaptive abilities are coded and passed along in genes.If the genes mutate, the organisms change.If the genes are altered, the organisms change.Bioengineers use both these forms of change, not only recombinant gene splicing, but also the much older art of selective breeding.Microorganisms are plated, and the fastest growers (or those that exhibit most the trait you want) can be culled and plated again; mutagens can be added to increase the mutation rate; and in the quick succession of microbial generations (say ten per day), you can repeat this process until you get something like what you want.Selective breeding is one of the most powerful bioengineering techniques we have.But the newer techniques tend to get the attention.Genetically engineered microorganisms, or GEMs, had been on the scene only about half a century when the first hundred arrived on Mars.But half a century in modern science is a long time.Plasmid conjugates had become very sophisticated tools in those years.The array of restriction enzymes for cutting, and ligase enzymes for pasting, was big and versatile; the ability to line out long DNA strings precisely was there; the accumulated knowledge of genomes was immense, and growing exponentially; and used all together, this new biotechnology was allowing all kinds of trait mobilization, promotion, replication, triggered suicide (to stop excess success), and so forth.It was possible to find the DNA sequences from an organism that carried the desired characteristic, and then synthesize these DNA messages and cut and paste them into plasmid rings; after that cells were washed and suspended in a glycerol with the new plasmids, and the glycerol was suspended between two electrodes and given a short sharp shock of about 2,000 volts, and the plasmids in the gycerol shot into the cells, and voil!There, zapped to life like Frankensteins monster, was a new organism.With new abilities.And so: fast growing lichens.Radiation resistant algae, Extreme cold fungi.Halophylic Archaea, eating salt and excreting oxygen.Surarctic mosses.An entire taxonomy of new kinds of life, all partially adapted to the surface of Mars, all out there having a try at it.Some species went extinct: natural selection.Some prospered: survival of the fittest.Some prospered wildly, at the expense of other organisms, and then chemicals in their excretions activated their suicide genes, and they died back until the levels of those chemicals dropped again.So life adapts to conditions.And at the same time, conditions are changed by life.That is one of the definitions of life: organism and environment change together in a reciprocal arrangement, as they are two manifestations of an ecology, two parts of a whole.And so: more oxygen and nitrogen in the air.Black fuzz on the polar ice.Black fuzz on the ragged surfaces of bubbled rock.Pale green patches on the ground.Bigger grains of frost in the air.Animalcules shoving through the depths of the regolith, like trillions of tiny moles, turning nitrites into nitrogen, oxides into oxygen.At first it was nearly invisible, and very slow.With a cold snap or a solar storm there would be massive die offs, whole species extinct in a night.But the remains of the dead fed other creatures; conditions were thus easier for them, and the process picked up momentum.Bacteria reproduce quickly, doubling their mass many times a day if conditions are right; the mathematical possibilities for the speed of their growth are staggering, and although environmental constraints especially on Mars keep all actual growth far from the mathematical limits, still, the new organisms, the areophytes, quickly reproduced, sometimes mutated, always died, and the new life fed on the compost of their ancestors, and reproduced again.Lived and died; and the soil and air left behind were different than they were before these millions of brief generations.And so one morning the sun rises, shooting long rays through the ragged cloud cover, up the length of Valles Marineris.On the north walls are tiny traces of black and yellow and olive and gray and green.Specks of lichen dot the vertical faces of stone, which stand as they always have, stony, and cracked, and red; but now speckled, as if with mold.Michel Duval dreamed of home.He was swimming in the surf off the point at Villefranche sur Mer, the warm August water lifting him up and down.It was windy and near sunset and the water was a sloppy white bronze, the sunlight bouncing all over it.The waves were big for the Mediterranean, swift breakers that rose up all riven with wind chop to crash in quick uneven lines, allowing him to ride them for a moment.Then it was under in a tumble of bubbles and sand, and back up into a burst of gold light and the taste of salt in everything, his eyes stinging voluptuously.Big black pelicans rode air cushions just over the swells, soared into steep clumsy turns, stalled, dropped into the water around him.They half folded their wings when they dove, making adjustments with them until the actual moment of the awkward crash into the water.Often they came up gulping small fish.Just meters from him one splashed in, silhouetted against the sun like a Stuka or a pterodactyl.Cool and warm, immersed in salt, he bobbed on the swell and blinked, blinded by salt light.A breaking wave looked like diamonds smashed to cream.His phone rang.His phone rang.It was Ursula and Phyllis, calling to tell him that Maya was having another fit and was inconsolable.He got up, put on unders and went to the bathroom.Waves leaped over a line of backwash.Maya, depressed again.Last time he had seen her she had been in high spirits, almost euphoric, and that was what, a week ago?But that was Maya.Maya was crazy.Crazy in a Russian way, however, which meant she was a power to be reckoned with.Mother Russia!The church and the communists both had tried to eradicate the matriarchy that had preceded them, and all they had achieved was a flood of bitter emasculating scorn, a whole nation full of contemptuous russalkas and baba yagas and twenty hour a day superwomen, living in a nearly parthenogenic culture of mothers, daughters, babushkas, granddaughters.Yet still necessarily absorbed in their relationships with men, desperately trying to find the lost father, the perfect mate.Or just a man who would pull his share of the load.Finding that great love, and then more often than not destroying it.Crazy!Well, it was dangerous to generalize.But Maya was a classic case.Moody, angry, flirtatious, brilliant, charming, manipulative, intense and now filling his office like a huge slab of dejection, her eyes red rimmed and bloodshot, her mouth haggard.Ursula and Phyllis nodded and whispered thanks to Michel for getting up so early, and left.He went to the venetian blinds and opened them, and the light from the central dome poured in.He saw again that Maya was a beautiful woman, with wild lustrous hair and a dark charismatic gaze, immediate and direct.It was dismaying to see her this upset, he never got used to it, it contrasted too sharply with her usual vivaciousness, the way she would put a finger to your arm as she rattled on in a confiding tone about one fascinating thing or other....All strangely mimicked by this desperate creature, who leaned forward onto his desk and began to tell him in a ragged hoarse voice about the latest scene in the unfolding drama of her and John, and then, again, Frank.Apparently she had gotten angry at John for refusing to help her in a plan she had to get some of the Russian based multinationals to underwrite the development of settlements in Hellas Basin, which being the deepest point on Mars was going to be first to benefit from the atmospheric changes they were beginning to see.The air pressure at Low Point, four kilometers below the datum, was always going to be ten times thicker than that on top of the great volcanoes, and three times thicker than at the datum.It was going to be the first human viable place, perfect for development.But apparently John preferred to work through UNOMA and governments.And this was just one of the many basic political disagreements which were beginning to infect their personal life, to the point that they were fighting pretty frequently about other things, things that didnt matter, things about which they had never fought before.Watching her Michel almost said, John wants you irritated with him.He wasnt sure what John would say to that.Maya rubbed her eyes, leaned her forehead on his desk, revealing the back of her neck and her broad rangy shoulders.She would never look this distraught in front of most of Underhill; it was an intimacy between them, something she only did with him.It was as if she had taken off her clothes.People didnt understand that true intimacy did not consist of sexual intercourse, which could be done with strangers and in a state of total alienation; intimacy consisted of talking for hours about what was most important in ones life.Although it was true she would be beautiful naked, she had perfect proportions.He recalled the way she looked swimming in the pool, doing the backstroke in a blue bathing suit cut high over the hipbones.A Mediterranean image: he was floating in the water at Villefranche, everything flooded with sunsets amber light, and he was looking in at the beach where men and women were walking, naked except for the neon triangles of cache sexe bathing suits brown skinned bare breasted women, walking in pairs like dancers in the sunlight then dolphins sliced out of the water between him and the beach, their sleek black bodies rounded like the womens  But now Maya was talking about Frank.Frank, who had a sixth sense for trouble between John and Maya (six would not be necessary), and who came running to Maya every time he felt the signs, to walk with her and talk about his vision of Mars, which was progressive, exciting, ambitious, everything that Johns was not.Frank is so much more dynamic than John these days, I dont know why.Because he agrees with you, Michel said.Maya shrugged.Perhaps thats all I mean.But we have a chance to build a whole civilization here, we do.But John is so ...Big sigh.And yet I love him, I really do.But ...She talked for a while about their past, how their courtship had saved the voyage out from anarchy (or at least ennui), how Johns easygoing stability had been so good for her.How you could count on him.How impressed she had been by his fame, how she had felt that the liaison made her part of world history forever.But now she understood that she herself was going to be part of world history anyway; all of them in the first hundred were.Her voice rose, became faster and more vehement: I dont need John for that now, I only need him for how I feel about him, but now we dont agree on anything and were not very much alike, and Frank who has been so careful to hold back no matter what, we agree about almost everything and Ive been so enthusiastic about that part that Ive given him the wrong signal again, so he did it again, yesterday in the pool he he held me, you know, took my arms in his hands she crossed her arms and clasped her biceps in her handsand asked me to leave John for him, which I would never do, and he was shaking, and I said I couldnt but I was shaking too.So later she had been on edge, and had started a fight with John, started it so flagrantly that he had gotten truly angry and had left and taken a rover out to Nadias arcade, and spent the night there with the construction team; and Frank had come to talk to her again, and when she had (just barely) put him off, Frank had declared he was going to live with the European settlement on the other side of the planet, he who was the colonys driving force!And hell really do it, hes not one to threaten.Hes been learning German the way he does, languages are nothing to Frank.Michel tried to concentrate on what she was saying.It was difficult, because he knew full well that in a week everything would be different, all the dynamics in that little trio altered beyond recognition.So it was hard to care.What about his troubles?They went much, much deeper; but no one ever listened to him.He walked back and forth in front of the window, reassuring her with the usual questions and comments.The greenery in the atrium was refreshing, it could have been a courtyard in Arles or Villefranche; or suddenly it reminded him of Avignons narrow plane tree shaded plaza near the Popes palace, the plaza and its caf tables which in the summer just after sunset had just the color of Mars.Taste of olive and red wine ...Lets go for a walk, he said.Standard part of therapy hour.They crossed the atrium and went to the kitchens, so Michel could eat a breakfast which he forgot even as he swallowed; we should call eating forgetting, he thought as they walked around the hall to the locks.They put on suits Maya entering a change room to get her unders on then checked them and went in the lock and depressurized it and then opened the big outer door and stepped outside.The diamond chill.For a while they stayed on the sidewalks circling Underhill, taking a tour of the dump and its great salt pyramids.Do you think theyll ever find a use for all this salt?he said.Sax is still working on it.From time to time Maya went on talking about John and Frank.Michel asked the questions that a shrink program would have asked, Maya answered in the way a Maya program would have answered.Their voices right in each others ears, the intimacy of the intercom.They came to the lichen farm, and Michel stopped to gaze over the trays, to soak in their intense living color.Black snow algae, and then thick mats of too lichen, in which the algae symbiote was a blue green strain that Vlad had just gotten to grow alone; red lichen, which seemed not to be doing well.Superfluous in any case.Yellow lichen, olive lichen, a lichen that looked exactly like battleship paint.Flaky white and lime green lichen living green!It pulsed in the eye, a rich and improbable desert flower.He had heard Hiroko, looking down at such a growth, say This is viriditas, which was Latin for greening power.The word had been coined by a Christian mystic of the Middle Ages, a woman named Hildegard.Viriditas, now adapting to conditions here, and spreading slowly over the lowlands of the northern hemisphere.In the southern summers it did even better; one day it had reached 285 degrees Kelvin, a record high by twelve degrees.The world was changing, Maya remarked as they walked by the flats.Yes, Michel said, and could not help adding, Only three hundred years before we reach livable temperatures.Maya laughed.She was feeling better.Soon she would be back on level, or at least crossing through that zone on the way to euphoria.Maya was labile.Stability lability was the most recent characteristic Michel had been studying in the first hundred; Maya represented the labile extreme.Lets drive out and see the arcade, she said.Michel agreed, wondering what might happen if they ran into John.They went to the parking lot and checked out a roadrunner.Michel drove the little jeep and listened to Maya talk.Did conversation change when voices were divorced from bodies, planted right in the ears of the listeners by helmet mikes?It was as if one were always on the phone, even when sitting next to the person you were talking to.Or was this better or worse?as if you were engaged in telepathy.The cement road was smooth, and he drove at the roadrunners top speed of sixty kph.He could just feel the rush of thin air against his faceplate.All that CO2 that Sax so wanted to scrub from the atmosphere.Sax would need powerful scrubbers, even more powerful than the lichens; he needed forests, enormous multilayered halophilic rain forests, trapping enormous loads of carbon in wood, leaves, mulch, peat.He needed peat bogs a hundred meters deep, rain forests a hundred meters tall.He had said as much.It marked Anns face just to hear the sound of his voice.Fifteen minutes drive and they came to Nadias arcade.The site was still under construction and looked raw and messy, like Underhill in the beginning but on a larger scale.A long mound of burgundy rubble had been excavated from the trench, which ran east and west like Big Mans grave.They stood at one end of the great trench.Thirty meters deep, thirty wide, a kilometer long.The south side of the trench was now a wall of glass, and the north side of the trench was covered with arrays of filtering mirrors, alternating with wall mesocosms, Mars jars or terrariums, all of them together a colorful mix, like a tapestry of past and future.Most of the terrariums were filled with spruce trees and other flora that made it resemble the great world wrapping Terran forest of the sixtieth latitude.Like Nadia Cherneshevskys old home in Siberia, in other words.Was this perhaps a sign that she had a touch of his disease?And could he prevail on her to build a Mediterranean?Nadia was up working on a bulldozer.A woman with her own kind of viriditas.She stopped and came over to talk briefly with them.The project was coming along, she told them calmly.Amazing what one could do with the robot vehicles that were still being sent up from Earth.The concourse was done, and planted with a variety of trees, including a strain of dwarf sequoia already thirty meters tall, nearly as tall as the whole arcade.The three stacked rows of Underhill style vaulted chambers behind the concourse were installed, their insulation in place.The settlement had just the other day been sealed and heated and pressurized, so that it was possible to work inside it without suits.The three floors were stacked on each other in ever smaller arches, reminding Michel of the Pont du Gard; of course all the architecture here was Roman in origin, so that should not be a surprise.The arches were wider, however, and slighter.Airier in the tolerance of the g.   Nadia went back to work.Such a calm person.Stabile, the very opposite of labile.Low keyed, private, inward.Couldnt be less like her old friend Maya, it was good for Maya to be around her.Opposite end of the scale, keep her from flying away.Set an example for her.As in this encounter, where Maya was matching Nadias calm tone.And when Nadia went back to work, Maya retained some of that serenity.Ill miss Underhill when we move out here, she said.Wont you?I dont think so, Michel said.This will be a lot sunnier.All three floors of the new habitat would open onto the tall concourse, and have terraced broad balconies on the sunny side of the rooms, so that even though the whole structure faced north and was buried deeper than Underhill, the heliotropic filtered mirrors on the other side of the trench would pour light onto them from dawn to dusk.Ill be happy to move.Weve needed the space from the beginning.But we wont get all this space to ourselves.Therell be new people here.Yes.But that will give us space of a different kind.She looked thoughtful.Like John and Frank leaving.Yes.But even that isnt necessarily a bad thing.In a larger society, he told her, the claustrophobic village atmosphere of Underhill would begin to dissipate; this would give a better perspective on certain aspects of things.Michel hesitated before continuing, unsure how to say it.Subtlety was dangerous when you were both using a second language, coming at it from different native tongues; possibilities for misunderstanding were all too real.You must accept the idea that you perhaps do not want to choose between John and Frank.That in fact you want them both.In the context of the first hundred that can only be scandalous.But in a larger world, over time ...Hiroko keeps ten men!she exclaimed angrily.Yes, and so do you.So do you.And in a larger world, no one will know or care.He went on reassuring her, telling her that she was powerful, that (using Franks terms) she was the alpha female of the troop.She disagreed and forced more praise from him until finally she was satiated, and he could suggest they return home.Dont you think it will be a shock to have new people around?Different people?She was driving, and as she turned to ask him this she almost drove off the road.I suppose.Parties had already landed in Borealis and Acidalia, and the videotapes of them had been a shock, you could see it in peoples faces.As if aliens had arrived from space.But so far only Ann and Simon had met with any of them in person, running into a rover expedition north of Noctis Labyrinthus.Ann said it felt as if someone had stepped out of the TV.My life feels like that all the time, Maya said sadly.Michel lifted his eyebrows.The Maya program would not have said that.What do you mean?Oh, you know.Half the time it seems like one big simulation, dont you think?No.He considered it.I dont.It was all too real, in fact the cold of it seeping up through the rover seat deep into his flesh inescapably real, inescapably cold.Perhaps as a Russian she didnt appreciate that.But it was always, always cold.Even at noon on midsummers day, with the sun overhead like an open furnace door blazing in the sand colored sky, the temperature would be at best 260 degrees Kelvin, meaning 15 degrees below zero Centigrade, cold enough to push through the mesh of a walker and make each move a little diamond pattern of hurt.As they approached Underhill Michel felt the cold pushing through the fabric into his skin, and he felt the too cool oxygenated air expand out of the mouthpiece deep into his lungs, and he glanced up at the sand horizon and the sand sky and said to himself, I am a diamondback snake, slithering through a red desert of cold stone and dry dust.Someday I will shed my skin like a phoenix in a fire, to become some new creature of the sun, to walk the beach naked and splash in warm salt water....Back at Underhill he turned on the shrink program in his head and asked Maya if she was feeling better, and she touched her faceplate to his, giving him a brief glimpse of a gaze that was a kiss.You know I do, her voice said in his ear.He nodded.I think Ill go for another walk, then, he said, and did not say, But what about me?What will make me feel better?He willed the movement of his legs and walked off.The bleak plain surrounding the base was a vision out of some post holocaust desolation, a nightmare world; nevertheless he didnt want to go back into their little warren of artificial light and heated air and carefully deployed colors, colors that he himself had chosen for the most part, utilizing the very latest in color mood theory, a theory which he now understood to be based on certain root assumptions that did not in fact apply here.The colors were all wrong, or worse, irrelevant.Wallpaper in hell.The phrase formed in his mind and pushed at his lips.Wallpaper in hell.Wallpaper in hell.Since theyre going to go crazy anyway ...Certainly it had been a mistake to have only one psychiatrist along.Every therapist on Earth was also in therapy, it was part of the job, it came with the territory.But his therapist was back in Nice, fifteen timeslipped minutes away at best, and Michel talked to him but he couldnt help.He didnt understand, not really; he lived where it was warm and blue, he could go outside, he was (Michel presumed) in reasonably good mental health.While Michel was a doctor in a hospice in a prison in hell; and the doctor was sick.He hadnt been able to adapt.People were different in that regard, it was a matter of temperament.Maya, walking toward the lock door, had a temperament quite different from his, which somehow enabled her to be completely at home here.To tell the truth he didnt think she really noticed her surroundings much in any case.And yet in other ways he and she were similar.It had to do with the lability stability index, and its particular emotionality; they were both labile.And yet fundamentally they were very different characters; the labile stabile index had to be considered in combination with the very different set of characteristics grouped under the labels extroversion and introversion.This had been his great discovery of the recent year, and now it structured all his thinking about himself and his charges.Walking toward the Alchemists Quarter, he fit the mornings events into the gridwork of this new characterological system.Extroversion introversion was one of the best studied systems of traits in all psychological theory, with great masses of evidence from many different cultures supporting the objective reality of the concept.Not as a simple duality of course; one did not label a person plainly this or that, but rather placed them on a scale, rating them for such qualities as sociability, impulsiveness, changeability, talkativeness, outgoingness, activity, liveliness, excitability, optimism, and so on.These measurements had been done so many times that it was statistically certain that the various traits did indeed hang together, to a degree that exceeded chance by a huge amount.So the concept was real, quite real!In fact physiological investigations had revealed that extroversion was linked with resting states of low cortical arousal, introversion with high cortical arousal; this had sounded backward to Michel at first, but then he remembered that the cortex inhibits the lower centers of the brain, so that low cortical arousal allows the more uninhibited behavior of the extrovert, while high cortical arousal is inhibitory and leads to introversion.This explained why drinking alcohol, a depressant which lowers cortical arousal, could lead to more excited and uninhibited behavior.So the whole collection of extrovert introvert traits, with all that they said about ones character, could be traced back to a group of cells in the brain stem called the ascending reticular activating system, the area that ultimately determined levels of cortical arousal.Thus they were driven by biology.There should be no such thing as fate: Ralph Waldo Emerson, a year after his six year old son died.But biology was fate.And there was more to Michels system; fate, after all, was no simple either/or.He had recently begun to consider Wengers index of autonomic balance, which used seven different variables to determine whether an individual was dominated by the sympathetic or the parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system.The sympathetic branch responds to outside stimuli and alerts the organism to action, so that individuals dominated by this branch were excitable; the parasympathetic branch, on the other hand, habituates the alerted organism to the stimulus, and restores it to homeostatic balance, so that individuals dominated by this branch were placid.Duffy had suggested calling these two classes of individuals labiles and stabiles, and this classification, while not as famous as extroversion and introversion, was just as solidly backed by empirical evidence, and just as useful in understanding varieties of temperament.Now, neither system of classification told the investigator all that much about the total nature of the personality being studied.The terms were so general, they were collections of so many traits, that they said very little in any useful diagnostic sense, especially since both were Gaussian curves in the actual population.But combine the two systems, and it began to get very interesting indeed.It was not a simple matter, and Michel had spent a fair amount of time at his computer screen sketching one kind of combinatoire after another, using the two different systems as the x and y axes of several different grids, none of which told him much.But then he began moving the four terms around the initial points of a Greimas semantic rectangle, a structuralist schema with alchemical ancestry, which proposed that no simple dialectic was enough to indicate the true complexity of any cluster of related concepts, so that it was necessary to acknowledge the real difference between somethings opposite and its contrary; the concept not X being not quite the same thing as anti X, as one saw immediately.So the first stage was usually indicated by using the four terms S,  S, S, and  S, in a simple rectangle:      Thus  S was a simple not S, and  S, was the stronger anti S; while S was for Michel the skullcracking negation of a negation, either a neutralizing of the initial opposition, or the union of the two negations; in practice this often remained a mystery or koan; but sometimes it came clear, as an idea that completed the conceptual unit quite nicely, as in one of Greimass examples:      The next step in the complication of the design, the step where new combinations often revealed structural relationships not at all obvious on the face of it, was to build another rectangle that bracketed the first at right angles, like so:      And Michel had stared at this schema, with extroversion, introversion, lability, and stability at the first four corners, and considered their combinations.Suddenly everything had fallen into focus, as if a kaleidoscope had clicked by accident into a depiction of a rose.For it made perfect sense: there were extroverts who were excitable, and extroverts who were on an even keel; there were introverts who were quite emotional, and those who were not.He could immediately think of examples among the colonists of all four of the types.When considering names to give these combined categories, he had had to laugh.Unbelievable!It was ironic at best to think that he had used the results of a centurys psychological thinking, and some of the latest laboratory research in psychophysiology, not to mention a complicated apparatus from structuralist alchemy, all in order to reinvent the ancient system of the humours.But there it was; that was what it came down to.For the northern combination, extroverted and stabile, was clearly what Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle, Trimestigus, Wundt, and Jung would have called sanguine; the western point, extroverted and labile, was choleric; in the east, introverted and stabile was phlegmatic; and in the south, introverted and labile was of course the very definition of the melancholic!Yes, they all fit perfectly!Galens physiological explanation for the four temperaments had been wrong, of course, and bile, choler, blood and phlegm had now been replaced as causative agents by the ascending reticular activating system and the autonomic nervous system; but the truths of human nature had held fast!And the powers of psychological insight and analytic logic of the first Greek physicians had been as strong, or rather stronger by far, than that of any subsequent generations, blinkered by an often useless accumulation of knowledge; and so the categories had endured and were reaffirmed, in age after age.Michel found himself in the Alchemists Quarter.He exerted himself to pay attention to it.Here men used arcane knowledge to make diamonds out of carbon, and they made it so easily and precisely that all their window glass was coated in a molecular layer of diamond to protect it from the corrosive dust.Their great white salt pyramids (one of the great shapes of ancient knowledge, the pyramid) were coated in layers of pure diamond.And the one molecule diamond coating process was just one of thousands of alchemical operations performed in these squat buildings.In recent years the buildings had taken on a faintly Moslem look, their white brick walls displaying equation after equation, all rendered in black flowing mosaic calligraphy.Michel ran into Sax, who was standing next to the terminal velocity equation displayed on the wall of the brick factory, and he switched to the common band: Can you turn lead into gold?Saxs helmet tilted quizzically.Why no, he said.Those are elements.It would be hard.Let me think about it some.Saxifrage Russell.The perfect Phlegmatic.The really useful part of mapping the four temperaments onto the semantic rectangle was that it immediately suggested a number of basic structural relationships between them, which then helped Michel to see their attractions and antagonisms in a new light.Maya was labile and extroverted, clearly choleric, and so was Frank; and both of them were leaders, and both were quite attracted to the other.Both being choleric, however, there was a volatile and essentially repellent aspect to the relationship as well, as if they recognized in each other exactly what they didnt like in themselves.And thus Mayas love for John, who was clearly sanguine, with an extroversion similar to Mayas but much more emotionally stabile, even to the point of placidity.So that most of the time he gave her great peace, like an anchor to reality which then occasionally rankled.And Johns attraction to Maya?The attraction of the unpredictable, perhaps; the spice in his hearty bland happiness.Sure, why not?You cant make love to your fame.Even though some people try.Yes, there were a lot of sanguines in the first hundred.Probably the psychological specs for selection to the colony preferred the type.Arkady, Ursula, Phyllis, Spencer, Yeli ...Yes.And stability being the most preferred quality for selection, there were naturally a lot of phlegmatics among them as well: Nadia, Sax, Simon Frazier, perhaps Hiroko the fact that one could not even be sure about her tended to support the guess Vlad, George, Alex.Phlegmatics and melancholics would naturally not get along, both being introverted and quick to withdraw, and the stabile one put off by the unpredictability of the labile, so that they would withdraw from each other, like Sax and Ann.There were not many melancholics among them.Ann, yes; and probably by the fate of her brains structure, although it did not help that she had been mistreated as a child.She had fallen in love with Mars for the same reason that Michel hated it: because it was dead.And Ann was in love with death.A few of the alchemists were melancholics as well.And, unfortunately, Michel himself.Perhaps five all told.Along both axes they had been selected against, as neither introversion nor lability had been considered desirable by the selection committee.Only people quite clever at concealing their real nature from the committee could have slipped through, people with great control over their personas, those larger than life masks that conceal all the wild inconsistencies within.Perhaps only a certain kind of persona had been selected to the colony, with a wide variety of persons behind it.Was that true?The selection committees had made impossible demands, it was important to remember that.They had wanted stabiles and yet they had wanted people who cared about going to Mars so passionately and monomaniacally that they would devote years of their lives to achieving the goal.Was that consistent?They wanted extroverts and they wanted brilliant scientists who necessarily had had to dive deep into solitary study for years and years.Was that consistent?No!Never.It went on like that all down the list.They had created double bind after double bind, no wonder the first hundred had hidden from them, had hated them!He recalled with a shudder that moment in the great solar storm on the Ares when everyone had realized how much lying and hiding they had had to do, when they had all turned and stared at him with all that pent up fury, as if it were all his fault, as if he were all psychology, and had concocted the criteria and conducted the tests and made the selections all by himself.How he had cringed at that moment, how alone he had felt!It had shocked him, frightened him, so much that he had not been able to think fast enough to confess that he too had lied, of course he had, more than any of the rest of them!But why had he lied, why?This was what he could not quite recall.Melancholia as a failure of memory, an acute sensation of the irreality of the past, its nonexistence ...He was a melancholic: withdrawn, out of control of his feelings, inclined to depression.He shouldnt have been chosen to go, and now he could not remember why he had fought so passionately to be chosen.The memory had gone away, overwhelmed perhaps by the poignant, aching, fragmented images of the life he had lived in the interstices of his desire to go to Mars.So minuscule and so precious; the evenings in the plazas, the summer days on the beaches, the nights in womens beds.The olive trees of Avignon.The green flame cypress.He found he had left the Alchemists Quarter.He was at the foot of the Great Salt Pyramid.He stepped slowly up the 400 stairs, putting his feet carefully on the blue no slip pads.Each step gave him a wider view of Underhill Plain, but it was still the same sere and barren rockpile, no matter how large it got.From the square white pavilion at the pyramids summit one could just see Chernobyl, and the spaceport.Other than that, nothing.Why had he come to this place?Why had he worked so hard to get here, sacrificing so many of the pleasures of life, family, home, leisure, play....He shook his head.So far as he could recall, it had simply been what he had wanted to do, the definition of his life.A compulsion, a life with a goal, how could you tell the difference?Moonlit nights in the fragrant olive grove, the ground dotted with small black circles and the electric warm brush of the mistral rustling the leaves in quick soft waves, flat on his back, arms spread wide, the leaves flickering silver and gray under the black bowl of stars; and one of those stars would be steady, faint, red, and he would seek it out and watch it, there among the windswept olive leaves; and he had been eight years old!My God, what were they?Nothing explained that, nothing explained them!As well explain why they had painted in Lascaux, why they had built stone cathedrals into the sky.Why coral polyps built reefs.He had had an ordinary youth, moved often, lost what friends he made, went to the University of Paris to study psychology, did his degree work on space station depression and went to work for Ariane, and then Glavkosmos.Along the way got married and divorced: Franoise had said he was not there.All those nights with her in Avignon, all those days in Villefranche sur Mer, living in the most beautiful place on Earth, and he had walked about in a fog of desire for Mars!It was absurd!Worse, it was stupid.A failure of the imagination, of memory, of, finally, intelligence itself: he had not been able to see what he had had, or to imagine what he would get.And now he was paying for it, trapped on an icefloe in the Arctic night with ninety nine foreigners, not one of whom spoke French worth a damn.Only three who could even try, and Franks French was worse than no French at all, like listening to someone attack the language with a hatchet.The absence of his minds own tongue had driven him to watching TV from home, which only exacerbated his pain.Still he taped video monologues, and sent them to his mother and sister, so that they would send replies in kind; he watched the replies many times, looking more at the backdrops than at his relatives.He even had occasional live conversations with journalists, waiting impatiently between exchanges.Those talks made it clear how famous he was in France, a household name, and he was careful to answer everything conventionally, playing the Michel Duval persona, running the Michel program.Sometimes he canceled consultations with fellow colonists when he was in the mood to listen to French; let them eat English!But these incidents got him a sharp reprimand from Frank, and a conference with Maya.Was he overworked?Of course not; only ninety nine people to keep sane, while at the same time wandering in a Provence of the mind, on tree covered steep hillsides with their vineyards and farmhouses and ruined towers and monasteries, in a living landscape, a landscape infinitely more beautiful and humane than the stony waste of this reality  He was in the TV lounge.While lost in thought he had apparently gone back inside.But he could not remember that; he had thought he was still standing on top of the Great Pyramid; and then he had blinked and was in the TV lounge (all asylums have them), watching a video image of one of the lichen covered canyon walls of Marineris.He shivered.It had happened again.He had lost touch, gone away and come to later in the day.It had happened already some dozen times before.And it was not just being lost in thought, but buried in it, dead to the world.He looked around the room, shivered convulsively.It was Ls = 5 now, the beginning of northern spring, and the northern walls of the great canyons were basking in the sun.Since theyre all going to go crazy anyway ...Then it was Ls = 157, and 152 degrees had passed in a blur of tele existence.He was basking in the sun in the courtyard of Franoises seaside villa in Villefranche sur Mer, looking down on tile rooftops and terra cotta pillars and a small pool, turquoise above the cobalt of the Mediterranean.A cypress stood like a green flame over the pool, swaying in a breeze and casting its perfume over his face.In the distance the green headland of a peninsula  Except really he was in Underhill Prime, usually called the trench, or Nadias arcade, sitting on the upper balcony looking out at a dwarf sequoia, behind it the glass wall and the mirrors with their gradient refractive index that guided the light down into the concourse from its origin on the Cte DOr.Tatiana Durova had been killed by a crane tipped by a robot, and Nadia was inconsolable.But grief runs off us, Michel thought as he sat with her, like rain off a duck.In time Nadia would be well.Meanwhile there was nothing to be done.Did they think he was a sorcerer?A priest?If that were true he would have healed himself, healed all this world, or better, flown through space home.Wouldnt that cause a sensation, to appear on the beach at Antibes and say, Bonjour, I am Michel, I have come home?Then it was Ls = 190, and he was a lizard on the top of the Pont du Gard, on the narrow rectangular rock plates that covered the actual aqueduct itself, which ran in its straight line high over the gorge.His diamondback skin had sloughed off around his tail, and the hot sun burned the new skin in crisscross lines.Except he was in Underhill, in fact, in the atrium, and Frank had gone off to live with the Japanese that had landed in Argyre, and Maya and John were at loggerheads about their rooms, and where to house the UNOMA local headquarters; and Maya, more beautiful than ever, stalked him through the atrium, imploring his aid.He and Marina Tokareva had stopped rooming together nearly a full Martian year before she had said he was not there and looking at Maya, Michel found himself imagining her as a lover but of course this was crazy, she was a russalka, she had slept with Glavkosmos bosses and cosmonauts to make her way up through the system and it had made her dissociated and bitter and unpredictable, she used sex to hurt now, sex was just diplomacy by other means to her, it would be insane to have anything to do with her in that mode, to be drawn down into the vortex of her limbs and her limbic system.Why not send crazy people in the first place ....But now it was Ls = 241.He walked over the honeycombed limestone parapet of Les Baux, looking in the ruined chambers of the medieval hermitage.It was near sunset and the light was a curious Martian orange, the limestone glowing, the whole village and hazy plain below stretching out to the white bronze line of the Mediterranean, looking as implausible as a dream...Except it was a dream, and he woke up, and found himself awake and back in Underhill.Phyllis and Edvard had just returned from an expedition and Phyllis was laughing and showing them a buttery lump of rock.It was scattered all over the canyon, she said laughing, gold nuggets the size of your fist.Then he was walking the tunnels out to the garage.The colonys psychiatrist, experiencing visions, falling into gaps of consciousness, gaps of memory.Physician, heal thyself!But he couldnt.He had gone insane of homesickness.Homesickness, there must be a better term for that, a scientific label that would legitimize it, make it real to others.But he already knew it was real.He missed Provence so much that at times he felt he could not breathe.He was like Nadias hand, a part of it torn away, the ghost nerves still throbbing with pain....And save them the trouble?Time passed.The Michel program walked around, a hollow persona, empty inside, only some tiny homunculus of the cerebellum left to teleoperate the thing.The night of the second day of Ls = 266, he went to bed.He was dog tired though he had done nothing, totally exhausted and drained, and yet he lay in the dark of his room and could not sleep.His mind spun miserably; he was very aware of how sick he was.He wished he could quit the pretense and admit that he had lost it, institutionalize himself.Go home.He could remember almost nothing of the previous few weeks or maybe it was longer than that?He was not sure.He began to weep.His door clicked.It swung open, and a narrow wedge of hall light shone in, unblocked.No one there.Hello?he said, working to keep the tears out of his voice.Who is it?The reply was right in his ear, as if from a helmet intercom: Come with me, a mans voice said.Michel jerked back and bumped into the wall.He stared up at a black silhouetted figure.We need your help, the figure whispered.A hand gripped his arm as he pressed back into the wall.And you need ours.A suggestion of a smile in the voice, which Michel did not recognize.Fear thrust him into a new world.Suddenly he could see much better, as if the touch of his visitor had sprung his pupils open like camera apertures.A thin dark skinned man.A stranger.Astonishment launched through his fear, and he got up and moved through the dark light with dreamlike precision, stepping into slippers, and then at the strangers urging following him out into the hallway, feeling the lightness of Martian g for the first time in years.The hallway seemed bursting with gray light, though he could tell that only the night strips in the floor were on.It was enough to see well by if you were scared.His companion had short black dreadlocks, which made his head appear spiked.He was short, thin, narrow faced.A stranger, no doubt about it.An intruder from one of the new colonies in the southern hemisphere, Michel thought.But the man was leading him through Underhill with an expert touch, moving in utter silence.Indeed the whole of Underhill was soundless, as if it were a silent black and white film.He glanced at his wristpad; it was blank.The timeslip.He wanted to say, Who are you?but the silence was so blanketing that he couldnt bring himself to speak.He mouthed the words and the man turned and looked over his shoulder at him, the whites of his eyes visible and luminous all the way around the irises, the nostrils wide black holes.Im the stowaway, he mouthed, and grinned.His eyeteeth were discolored; they were made of stone, Michel suddenly saw that.Martian stone teeth in his head.He took Michel by the arm.They were heading to the farm lock.We need helmets out there, Michel whispered, balking.Not tonight.The man opened the lock door, and no air rushed into it even though it was open on the other side.They went in and walked between the black rows of packed foliage, and the air was sweet.Hiroko will be angry, Michel thought.His guide was gone.Ahead Michel saw movement, and heard a tinkly little laugh.It sounded like a child.Suddenly it occurred to Michel that the absence of children accounted for the colonys pervasive feeling of sterility, that they could build buildings and grow plants and yet without children this sterile feeling would still permeate every part of their lives.Extremely frightened, he continued to walk toward the center of the farm.It was warm and humid, and the air stank of wet dirt and fertilizer and foliage.Light glinted from thousands of leaf surfaces, as if the stars had fallen through the clear roof and clustered around him.Rows of corn rustled, and the air was going to his head like brandy.Little feet were scurrying behind the narrow rice paddies: even in the darkness the rice was an intense blackish green, and there among the paddies were small faces, grinning knee high and disappearing when he turned to face them.Hot blood flooded his face and hands, his blood turned to fire, and he retreated three steps, then stopped and spun.Two naked little girls were walking down the lane toward him, black haired, dark skinned, about three years old.Their oriental eyes were bright in the gloom, their expressions solemn.They took him by the hands and turned him around; he allowed them to lead him down the lane, looking down at first one head and then the other.Someone had decided to take action against their sterility.As they walked along other naked toddlers appeared out of the shrubbery and crowded around them, boys and girls both, some a bit darker or lighter than the first two, most the same color, all the same age.Nine or ten of them escorted Michel to the center of the farm, weaving around him in a quick trot.And there at the center of the maze was a small clearing, currently occupied by about a dozen adults, all naked, seated in a rough circle.The children ran to the adults, gave them hugs and sat at their knees.Michels pupils opened further in the nimbus of starlight and leaf gleam, and he recognized members of the farm team, Iwao, Raul, Ellen, Rya, Gene, Evgenia, all of the farm team except for Hiroko herself.After a moments hesitation Michel stepped out of his slippers and took off his clothes, and put them on top of the slippers and sat down in an empty spot in the circle.He didnt know what he was taking part in, but it didnt matter.Several of the figures nodded at him in welcome, and Ellen and Evgenia, seated on each side of him, touched him on the arms.All of a sudden the children got up and ran together down one of the aisles, squealing and giggling.They came back in a tight knot around Hiroko, who walked into the middle of the circle, her naked form dark in the darkness.Trailed by the kids she walked slowly around the circle, pouring from her two outstretched fists a little bit of dirt into each persons offered hands.Michel held up his palms with Ellen and Evgenia as she approached, he stared at her lustrous skin.Once on the night beach at Villefranche he had walked by a gang of African women splashing in the phosphorescent waves, white water on black gleaming skin  The dirt in his hand was warm and smelled rusty.This is our body, Hiroko said.She walked to the other side of the circle, gave the children each a fistful of dirt and sent them back to sit among the adults.She sat across from Michel and began to chant in Japanese.Evgenia leaned over and whispered a translation or rather an explanation in his ear.They were celebrating the areophany, a ceremony they had created together under Hirokos guidance and inspiration.It was a kind of landscape religion, a consciousness of Mars as a physical space suffused with kami, which was the spiritual energy or power that rested in the land itself.Kami was manifested most obviously in certain extraordinary objects in the landscape stone pillars, isolated ejecta, sheer cliffs, oddly smoothed crater interiors, the broad circular peaks of the great volcanoes.These intensified expressions of Marss kami had a Terran analogue within the colonists themselves, the power that Hiroko called viriditas, that greening fructiparous power within, which knows that the wild world itself is holy.Kami, viriditas; it was the combination of these sacred powers that would allow humans to exist here in a meaningful way.When Michel heard Evgenia whisper the word combination, all the terms immediately fell into a semantic rectangle: kami and viriditas, Mars and Earth, hatred and love, absence and yearning.And then the kaleidoscope clicked home and all the rectangles folded into place in his mind, all antinomies collapsed to a single, beautiful rose, the heart of the areophany, kami suffused with viriditas, both fully red and fully green at one and the same time.His jaw was slack, his skin was burning, he could not explain it and did not want to.His blood was fire in his veins.Hiroko stopped chanting, brought her hand to her mouth, began to eat the dirt in her palm.All the others did the same.Michel lifted his hand to is face: a lot of dirt to eat, but he stuck his tongue out and licked up half of it and felt a brief electric shiver as he rubbed it against the roof of his mouth, sliding the gritty stuff back and forth until it was mud.It tasted salty and rusty, with an unpleasant whiff of rotten eggs and chemicals.He choked it down, gagging slightly.He swallowed the other mouthful in his hand.There was an irregular hum coming from the circle of celebrants as they ate, vowel sounds shifting from one to the next, aaaay, ooooo, ahhhh, iiiiiii, eeee, uuuuuu, lingering over each vowel for a minute it seemed, the sound spreading into two and sometimes three parts, with head tones creating odd harmonies.Hiroko began to chant over this song.Everyone stood and Michel scrambled up with them.They all moved into the center of the circle together, Evgenia and Ellen taking Michel by the arms and pulling him along.Then they were all pressed together around Hiroko, in a mass of close packed bodies, surrounding Michel so that warm skin squashed up against every side of him.This is our body.A lot of them were kissing, their eyes closed.Slowly they moved, twisting to keep maximum contact as they shifted to new kinetic configurations.Wiry pubic hair tickled his bottom, and he felt what had to have been an erect penis against his hip.The dirt was heavy in his stomach, and he felt light headed; his blood was fire, his skin felt like a taut balloon, containing a blaze.The stars were packed overhead in astonishing numbers, and each one had its own color, green or red or blue or yellow; they looked like sparks.He was a phoenix.Hiroko herself pressed against him, and he rose in the center of the fire, ready for rebirth.She held his new body in a full embrace, squeezed him; she was tall, and seemed all muscle.She looked him eye to eye.He felt her breasts against his ribs, her pubic bone hard on his thigh.She kissed him, her tongue touching his teeth; he tasted the dirt, then suddenly felt all of her at once; all the rest of his life the involuntary memory of that feeling would be enough to start the pulse of an erection, but at that moment he was too overwhelmed, completely aflame.Hiroko pulled her head back and looked at him again.His breath was whooshing in his lungs, in and out.In English, in a voice formal but kind, she said, This is your initiation into the areophany, the celebration of the body of Mars.Welcome to it.We worship this world.We intend to make a place for ourselves here, a place that is beautiful in a new Martian way, a way never seen on Earth.We have built a hidden refuge in the south, and now we are leaving for it.We know you, we love you.We know we can use your help.We know you can use our help.We want to build just what you are yearning for, just what you have been missing here.But all in new forms.For we can never go back.We must go forward.We must find our own way.We start tonight.We want you to come with us.And Michel said, Ill come.Part 5    Falling into History      The lab hummed quietly.Desks and tables and benches were cluttered with things, the white walls crowded with graphs and posters and cut out cartoons, all vibrating slightly under bright artificial light.Like any lab anywhere: somewhat clean, somewhat disorderly.The one window in the corner was black and reflected the interior; it was night outside.The whole building was nearly empty.But two men in lab coats stood at one of the benches, leaning forward to look at a computer screen.The shorter of the two tapped at the keyboard below the screen with a forefinger, and the image on the screen changed.Green corkscrews on a black field, squiggling so that they looked sharply three dimensional, as if the screen were a box.An image from an electron microscope; the field was only a few microns across.You see its a kind of plasmid repair of the gene sequence, the short scientist said.Breaks in the original strands are identified.Replacement sequences are synthesized, and when mass quantities of these replacement sequences are introduced into the cell, the breaks are seen as attachment sites, and the replacements bind to the originals.Do you introduce them by transformation?Electroporation?Transformation.Treated cells are injected along with a competent, and the repair strands make a conjugal transfer.In vivo?In vivo.A low whistle.So you can repair any little thing?Cell division error?Thats right.The two men stared at the corkscrews on the screen, waving about like the new tips of grapevines in a breeze.Youve got proof?Did Vlad show you those mice in the next room?Yeah.Those mice are fifteen years old.Another whistle.They went next door into the mice room, muttering to each other under the hum of machinery.The tall one stared curiously into a cage, where patches of fur breathed under wood chips.When they left again they turned out the lights in both rooms.The flicker of the electron microscope screen illuminated the first lab, giving it a green cast.The scientists went to the window, talking in low voices.They looked out.The sky was purple with the coming day; stars were popping out of existence.Out on the horizon stood a black massive bulk, the flat topped mound of an immense volcano.Olympus Mons, the largest mountain in the solar system.The tall scientist shook his head.This changes everything, you know.I know.From the bottom of the shaft, the sky looked like a bright pink coin.The shaft was round, a kilometer in diameter, seven kilometers deep.But from the bottom it seemed much thinner and deeper than that.Perspective plays a lot of tricks on the human eye.Such as that bird, flying down the round pink dot of the sky, looking so big.Except it wasnt a bird.Hey, John said.The shaft director, a round faced Japanese named Etsu Okakura, looked at him, and through their two faceplates John could see the mans nervous grin.One of his teeth was discolored.Okakura looked up.Something falling!he said quickly, and then: Run!They turned and ran over the shaft floor.Quickly John found that although most of the loose rock had been swept off the starred black basalt, no effort had been made to make the shaft bottom perfectly level.Miniature craters and scarps became increasingly difficult as he gained speed; in this moment of primate flight the instincts formed in childhood reasserted themselves, and he kept pushing off too hard with each step, coming down on uninspected terrain with a jolt and then pushing off wildly again, a crazy run until finally he caught his toe and lost control and fell crashing across the ragged stone, arms flung out to save his faceplate.It was small comfort to see that Okakura had fallen as well.Fortunately the same gravity that had caused their tumbles was giving them more time to escape; the falling object had not yet landed.They got up and ran again, and once again Okakura fell.John glanced back and saw a bright metallic blur hit the rock, and then the sound of the impact was a solid whump, like a blow.Silver bits splashed away, some in their direction; he stopped running, scanned the air for incoming ejecta.No sound at all.A big hydraulic cylinder flew out of the air and banged end over end to their left, and they both jumped.He hadnt seen it coming.After that, stillness.They stood nearly a minute, and then Boone stirred.He was sweating; they were in pressurized suits, but at 49 degrees Centigrade the shaft bottom was the hottest place on Mars, and the suits insulation was built for cold.He made a move to help Okakura to his feet, but stopped himself; presumably the man would rather get up himself than owe giri to Boone for the help.If Boone understood the concept properly.Lets have a look, he said instead.Okakura got up, and they walked back over the dense black basalt.The shaft had long ago bored into solid bedrock, in fact it was now about 20 percent of the way through the lithosphere.It was stifling at the bottom, as if the suits were entirely uninsulated.Boones air supply was a welcome coolness in the face and lungs.Framed by the dark shaft walls, the pink sky above was very bright.Sunlight illuminated a short conic section of the shaft wall.In midsummer the sun might shine all the way no, they were south of the Tropic of Capricorn.In shadow forever, down here.They approached the wreck.It had been a robot dump truck, hauling rock up the road that cut a spiral into the shaft wall.Pieces of the truck were mixed with big rough boulders, some scattered as much as a hundred meters from the point of impact.Beyond a hundred meters debris was rare; the cylinder that had flown by them must have been fired out under pressure of some kind.A pile of magnesium, aluminum and steel, all twisted horribly.The magnesium and aluminum had partially melted.Do you think it fell all the way from the top?Boone asked.Okakura didnt respond.Boone glanced at him; the man was studiously avoiding his gaze.Perhaps he was frightened.Boone said, There must have been a good thirty seconds between the time I caught sight of it and when it hit.At roughly three meters per second squared, that had been more than enough time for it to reach terminal velocity.So it had hit at about 200 kilometers per hour.Not so bad, really.On Earth it would have come down in less than half the time, and might have caught them.Hell, if he hadnt looked up when he had, this one might have caught them.He made a quick calculation.It had probably been about halfway up the shaft when he saw it.
