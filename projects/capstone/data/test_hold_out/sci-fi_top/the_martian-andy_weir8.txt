Next came some testing.I put the bagged RTG at the bottom of the container and filled it with water.It holds twenty liters, and the RTG quickly heated it.It was gaining a degree per minute.I let it go until it was a good 40C.Then I hooked up the regulators return air line to my contraption and watched the results.It worked great!The air bubbled through, just like Id hoped.Even better, the bubbles agitated the water, which distributed the heat evenly.I let it run for an hour, and the Hab started to get cold.The RTGs heat cant keep up with the total loss from the Habs impressive surface area.Not a problem.Ive already established its plenty to keep the rover warm.I reattached the return air line to the regulator and things got back to normal.LOG ENTRY: SOL 381  Ive been thinking about laws on Mars.Yeah, I know, its a stupid thing to think about, but I have a lot of free time.Theres an international treaty saying no country can lay claim to anything thats not on Earth.And by another treaty, if youre not in any countrys territory, maritime law applies.So Mars is international waters.NASA is an American nonmilitary organization, and it owns the Hab.So while Im in the Hab, American law applies.As soon as I step outside, Im in international waters.Then when I get in the rover, Im back to American law.Heres the cool part: I will eventually go to Schiaparelli and commandeer the Ares 4 lander.Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this, and they cant until Im aboard Ares 4 and operating the comm system.After I board Ares 4, before talking to NASA, I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission.That makes me a pirate!A space pirate!LOG ENTRY: SOL 383  You may be wondering what else I do with my free time.I spend a lot of it sitting around on my lazy ass watching TV.But so do you, so dont judge.Also, I plan my trip.Pathfinder was a cake run.Flat, level ground all the way.The only problem was navigating.But the trip to Schiaparelli will mean going over massive elevation changes.I have a rough satellite map of the whole planet.It doesnt have much detail, but Im lucky to have it at all.NASA didnt expect me to wander 3200 kilometers from the Hab.Acidalia Planitia (where I am) has a relatively low elevation.So does Schiaparelli.But between them it goes up and down by 10 kilometers.Theres going to be a lot of dangerous driving.Things will be smooth while Im in Acidalia, but thats only the first 650 kilometers.After that comes the crater riddled terrain of Arabia Terra.I do have one thing going for me.And I swear its a gift from God.For some geological reason, theres a valley called Mawrth Vallis thats perfectly placed.Millions of years ago it was a river.Now its a valley that juts into the brutal terrain of Arabia, almost directly toward Schiaparelli.Its much gentler terrain than the rest of Arabia Terra, and the far end looks like a smooth ascent out of the valley.Between Acidalia and Mawrth Vallis Ill get 1350 kilometers of relatively easy terrain.The other 1850 kilometers well, that wont be so nice.Especially when I have to descend into Schiaparelli itself.Ugh.Anyway.Mawrth Vallis.Awesome.LOG ENTRY: SOL 385  The worst part of the Pathfinder trip was being trapped in the rover.I had to live in a cramped environment that was full of junk and reeked of body odor.Same as my college days.Rim shot!Seriously though, it sucked.It was twenty two sols of abject misery.I plan to leave for Schiaparelli 100 sols before my rescue (or death), and I swear to God Ill rip my own face off if I have to live in the rover for that long.I need a place to stay where I can stand up and take a few steps without hitting things.And no, being outside in a goddamn EVA suit doesnt count.I need personal space, not 50 kilograms of clothing.So today, I started making a tent.Somewhere I can relax while the batteries recharge; somewhere I can lie down comfortably while sleeping.I recently sacrificed one of my two pop tents to be the trailer balloon, but the other is in perfect shape.Even better, it has an attachment for the rovers airlock.Before I made it a potato farm, its original purpose was to be a lifeboat for the rover.I could attach the pop tent to either vehicles airlock.Im going with the rover instead of the trailer.The rover has the computer and controls.If I need to know the status of anything (like life support or how well the battery is charging), Ill need access.This way, Ill be able to walk right in.No EVA.Also, while traveling, Ill keep the tent folded up in the rover.In an emergency, I can get to it fast.The pop tent is the basis of my bedroom, but not the whole thing.The tents not very big; not much more space than the rover.But it has the airlock attachment so its a great place to start.My plan is to double the floor area and double the height.Thatll give me a nice big space to relax in.For the floor, Ill use the original flooring material from the two pop tents.If I didnt, my bedroom would become a big hamster ball because Hab canvas is flexible.When you fill it with pressure, it wants to become a sphere.Thats not a useful shape.To combat this, the Hab and pop tents have special flooring material.It unfolds as a bunch of little segments that wont open beyond 180 degrees, so it remains flat.The pop tent base is a hexagon.I have another base left over from what is now the trailer balloon.When Im done, the bedroom will be two adjacent hexes with walls around them and a crude ceiling.Its gonna take a lot of glue to make this happen.LOG ENTRY: SOL 387  The pop tent is 1.2 meters tall.Its not made for comfort.Its made for astronauts to cower in while their crewmates rescue them.I want two meters.I want to be able to stand!I dont think thats too much to ask.On paper, its not hard to do.I just need to cut canvas pieces to the right shapes, seal them together, then seal them to the existing canvas and flooring.But thats a lot of canvas.I started this mission with six square meters and Ive used up most of that.Mostly on sealing the breach from when the Hab blew up.God damn Airlock 1.Anyway, my bedroom will take 30 square meters of the stuff.Way the hell more than I have left.Fortunately, I have an alternate supply of Hab canvas: the Hab.Problem is (follow me closely here, the science is pretty complicated), if I cut a hole in the Hab, the air wont stay inside anymore.Ill have to depressurize the Hab, cut chunks out, and put it back together (smaller).I spent today figuring out the exact sizes and shapes of canvas Ill need.I need to not fuck this up, so I triple checked everything.I even made a model out of paper.The Hab is a dome.If I take canvas from near the floor, I can pull the remaining canvas down and reseal it.The Hab will become a lopsided dome, but that shouldnt matter.As long as it holds pressure.I only need it to last another sixty two sols.I drew the shapes on the wall with a Sharpie.Then I spent a long time re measuring them and making sure, over and over, that they were right.That was all I did today.Might not seem like much, but the math and design work took all day.Now its time for dinner.Ive been eating potatoes for weeks.Theoretically, with my three quarter ration plan, I should still be eating food packs.But three quarter ration is hard to maintain, so now Im eating potatoes.I have enough to last till launch, so I wont starve.But Im pretty damn sick of potatoes.Also, they have a lot of fiber, so lets just say its good Im the only guy on this planet.I saved five meal packs for special occasions.I wrote their names on each one.I get to eat Departure the day I leave for Schiaparelli.Ill eat Halfway when I reach the 1600 kilometer mark, and Arrival when I get there.The fourth one is Survived Something That Should Have Killed Me because some fucking thing will happen, I just know it.I dont know what itll be, but itll happen.The rover will break down, or Ill come down with fatal hemorrhoids, or Ill run into hostile Martians, or some shit.When I do (if I live), I get to eat that meal pack.The fifth one is reserved for the day I launch.Its labeled Last Meal.Maybe thats not such a good name.LOG ENTRY: SOL 388  I started the day with a potato.I washed it down with some Martian coffee.Thats my name for hot water with a caffeine pill dissolved in it.I ran out of real coffee months ago.My first order of business was a careful inventory of the Hab.I needed to root out anything that would have a problem with losing atmospheric pressure.Of course, everything in the Hab had a crash course in depressurization a few months back.But this time would be controlled, and I might as well do it right.The main thing is the water.I lost 300 liters to sublimation when the Hab blew up.This time, that wont happen.I drained the water reclaimer and sealed all the tanks.The rest was just collecting knickknacks and dumping them in Airlock 3.Anything I could think of that doesnt do well in a near vacuum.All the pens, vitamin bottles (probably not necessary but Im not taking chances), medical supplies, etc.Then I did a controlled shutdown of the Hab.The critical components are designed to survive a vacuum.Hab depress is one of the many scenarios NASA accounted for.One system at a time, I cleanly shut them all down, ending with the main computer itself.I suited up and depressurized the Hab.Last time, the canvas collapsed and made a mess of everything.Thats not supposed to happen.The dome of the Hab is mostly supported by air pressure, but there are flexible reinforcing poles across the inside to hold up the canvas.Its how the Hab was assembled in the first place.I watched as the canvas gently settled onto the poles.To confirm the depressurization, I opened both doors of Airlock 2.I left Airlock 3 alone.It maintained pressure for its cargo of random crap.Then I cut shit up!Im not a materials engineer; my design for the bedroom isnt elegant.Its just a six meter perimeter and a ceiling.No, it wont have right angles and corners (pressure vessels dont like those).Itll balloon out to a more round shape.Anyway, it means I only needed to cut two big ass strips of canvas.One for the walls and one for the ceiling.After mangling the Hab, I pulled the remaining canvas down to the flooring and resealed it.Ever set up a camping tent?From the inside?While wearing a suit of armor?It was a pain in the ass.I repressurized to one twentieth of an atmosphere to see if it could hold pressure.Ha ha ha!Of course it couldnt!Leaks galore.Time to find them.On Earth, tiny particles get attached to water or wear down to nothing.On Mars, they just hang around.The top layer of sand is like talcum powder.I went outside with a bag and scraped along the surface.I got some normal sand, but plenty of powder, too.I had the Hab maintain the one twentieth atmosphere, backfilling as air leaked out.Then I puffed the bag to get the smallest particles to float around.They were quickly drawn to where the leaks were.As I found each leak, I spot sealed it with resin.It took hours, but I finally got a good seal.Ill tell ya, the Hab looks pretty ghetto now.One whole side of it is lower than the rest.Ill have to hunch down when Im over there.I pressurized to a full atmosphere and waited an hour.No leaks.Its been a long, physically taxing day.Im totally exhausted but I cant sleep.Every sound scares the shit out of me.Is that the Hab popping?No?Okay What was that!?Oh, nothing?Okay  Its a terrible thing to have my life depend on my half assed handiwork.Time to get a sleeping pill from the medical supplies.LOG ENTRY: SOL 389  What the hell is in those sleeping pills!?Its the middle of the day.After two cups of Martian coffee, I woke up a little.I wont be taking another one of those pills.Its not like I have to go to work in the morning.Anyway, as you can tell from how not dead I am, the Hab stayed sealed overnight.The seal is solid.Ugly as hell, but solid.Todays task was the bedroom.Assembling the bedroom was way easier than resealing the Hab.Because this time, I didnt have to wear an EVA suit.I made the whole thing inside the Hab.Why not?Its just canvas.I can roll it up and take it out an airlock when Im done.First, I did some surgery on the remaining pop tent.I needed to keep the roverairlock connector and surrounding canvas.The rest of the canvas had to go.Why hack off most of the canvas only to replace it with more canvas?Seams.NASA is good at making things.I am not.The dangerous part of this structure wont be the canvas.Itll be the seams.And I get less total seam length by not trying to use the existing pop tent canvas.After hacking away most of the remaining tent, I seal stripped the two pop tent floors together.Then I sealed the new canvas pieces into place.It was so much easier without the EVA suit on.So much easier!Then I had to test it.Again, I did it in the Hab.I brought an EVA suit into the tent with me and closed the mini airlock door.Then I fired up the EVA suit, leaving the helmet off.I told it to bump the pressure up to 1.2 atm.It took a little while to bring it up to par, and I had to disable some alarms on the suit.(Hey, Im pretty sure the helmets not on!).It depleted most of the N2 tank but was finally able to bring up the pressure.Then I sat around and waited.I breathed; the suit regulated the air.All was well.I watched the suit readouts carefully to see if it had to replace any lost air.After an hour with no noticeable change, I declared the first test a success.I rolled up the whole thing (wadded up, really) and took it out to the rover.You know, I suit up a lot these days.I bet thats another record I hold.A typical Martian astronaut does, what, forty EVAs?Ive done several hundred.Once I brought the bedroom to the rover, I attached it to the airlock from the inside.Then I pulled the release to let it loose.I was still wearing my EVA suit, because Im not an idiot.The bedroom fired out and filled in three seconds.The open airlock hatchway led directly to it, and it appeared to be holding pressure.Just like before, I let it sit for an hour.And just like before, it worked great.Unlike the Hab canvas resealing, I got this one right on the first try.Mostly because I didnt have to do it with a damn EVA suit on.Originally, I planned to let my bedroom sit overnight and check on it in the morning.But I ran into a problem: I cant get out if I do that.The rover has only one airlock, and the bedroom was attached to it.There was no way for me to get out without detaching the bedroom, and no way to attach and pressurize the bedroom without being inside the rover.Its a little scary.The first time I test the thing overnight will be with me in it.But thatll be later.Ive done enough today.LOG ENTRY: SOL 390  I have to face facts.Im done prepping the rover.I dont feel like Im done.But its ready to go:  Food: 1692 potatoes.Vitamin pills.Water: 620 liters.Shelter: Rover, trailer, bedroom.Air: Rover and trailer combined storage: 14 liters liquid O2, 14 liters liquid N2.Life Support: Oxygenator and atmospheric regulator.418 hours of use and discard CO2 filters for emergencies.Power: 36 kilowatt hours of storage.Carrying capacity for 29 solar cells.Heat: 1400 watt RTG.Homemade reservoir to heat regulators return air.Electric heater in rover as a backup.Disco: Lifetime supply.Im leaving here on Sol 449.That gives me fifty nine sols to test everything and fix whatever isnt working right.Then decide whats coming with me and whats staying behind.And plot a route to Schiaparelli using a grainy satellite map.And rack my brains trying to think of anything important I forgot.Since Sol 6 all Ive wanted to do was get the hell out of here.Now the prospect of leaving the Hab behind scares the shit out of me.I need some encouragement.I need to ask myself, What would an Apollo astronaut do?Hed drink three whiskey sours, drive his Corvette to the launchpad, then fly to the moon in a command module smaller than my Rover.Man those guys were cool.Chapter 21      LOG ENTRY: SOL 431  Im working out how to pack.Its harder than it sounds.I have two pressure vessels: the rover and the trailer.Theyre connected by hoses, but theyre also not stupid.If one loses pressure, the other will instantly seal off the shared lines.Theres a grim logic to this: If the rover breaches, Im dead.No point in planning around that.But if the trailer breaches, Ill be fine.That means I should put everything important in the rover.Everything that goes in the trailer has to be comfortable in near vacuum and freezing temperatures.Not that I anticipate that, but you know.Plan for the worst.The saddlebags I made for the Pathfinder trip will come in handy for food storage.I cant just store potatoes in the rover or trailer.Theyd rot in the warm, pressurized environment.Ill keep some in the rover for easy access, but the rest will be outside in the giant freezer that is this planet.The trailer will be packed pretty tight.Itll have two bulky Hab batteries, the atmospheric regulator, the oxygenator, and my homemade heat reservoir.It would be more convenient to have the reservoir in the rover, but it has to be near the regulators return air feed.The rover will be pretty packed, too.When Im driving, Ill keep the bedroom folded up near the airlock, ready for emergency egress.Also, Ill have the two functional EVA suits in there with me and anything that might be needed for emergency repairs: tool kits, spare parts, my nearly depleted supply of sealant, the other rovers main computer (just in case!), and all 620 glorious liters of water.And a plastic box to serve as a toilet.One with a good lid.*  Hows Watney doing?Venkat asked.Mindy looked up from her computer with a start.Dr.Kapoor?I hear you caught a pic of him during an EVA?Uh, yeah, Mindy said, typing on her keyboard.I noticed things would always change around 9 a. m.  local time.People usually keep the same patterns, so I figured he likes to start work around then.I did some minor realignment to get seventeen pics between 9 and 9:10.He showed up in one of them.Good thinking.Can I see the pic?Sure.She brought up the image on her screen.Venkat peered at the blurry image.Is this as good as it gets?Well, it is a photo taken from orbit, Mindy said.The NSA enhanced the image with the best software they have.Wait, what?Venkat stammered.The NSA?Yeah, they called and offered to help out.Same software they use for enhancing spy satellite imagery.Venkat shrugged.Its amazing how much red tape gets cut when everyones rooting for one man to survive.He pointed to the screen.Whats Watney doing here?I think hes loading something into the rover.When was the last time he worked on the trailer?Venkat asked.Not for a while.Why doesnt he write us notes more often?Venkat shrugged.Hes busy.He works most of the daylight hours, and arranging rocks to spell a message takes time and energy.So Mindy said.Whyd you come here in person?We could have done all this over e mail.Actually, I came to talk to you, he said.Theres going to be a change in your responsibilities.From now on, instead of managing the satellites around Mars, your sole responsibility is watching Mark Watney.What?Mindy said.What about course corrections and alignment?Well assign that to other people, Venkat said.From now on, your only focus is examining imagery of Ares 3.Thats a demotion, Mindy said.Im an orbital engineer, and youre turning me into a glorified Peeping Tom.Its short term, Venkat said.And well make it up to you.Thing is, youve been doing it for months, and youre an expert at identifying elements of Ares 3 from satellite pics.We dont have anyone else who can do that.Why is this suddenly so important?Hes running out of time, Venkat said.We dont know how far along he is on the rover modifications.But we do know hes only got sixteen sols to get them done.We need to know exactly what hes doing.Ive got media outlets and senators asking for his status all the time.The President even called me a couple of times.But seeing his status doesnt help, Mindy said.Its not like we can do anything about it if he falls behind.This is a pointless task.How long have you worked for the government?Venkat sighed.LOG ENTRY: SOL 434  The time has come to test this baby out.This presents a problem.Unlike on my Pathfinder trip, I have to take vital life support elements out of the Hab if Im going to do a real dry run.When you take the atmospheric regulator and oxygenator out of the Hab, youre left with a tent.A big round tent that cant support life.Its not as risky as it seems.As always, the dangerous part about life support is managing carbon dioxide.When the air gets to 1 percent CO2, you start getting symptoms of poisoning.So I need to keep the Habs mix below that.The Habs internal volume is about 120,000 liters.Breathing normally, it would take me over two days to bring the CO2 level up to 1 percent (and I wouldnt even put a dent in the O2 level).So its safe to move the regulator and oxygenator over for a while.Both are way too big to fit through the trailer airlock.Lucky for me, they came to Mars with some assembly required.They were too big to send whole, so theyre easy to dismantle.Over several trips, I moved all of their chunks to the trailer.I brought each chunk in through the airlock, one at a time.It was a pain in the ass reassembling them inside, let me tell you.Theres barely enough room for all the shit the trailers got to hold.There wasnt much left for our intrepid hero.Then I got the AREC.It sat outside the Hab like an AC unit might on Earth.In a way, thats what it is.I hauled it over to the trailer and lashed it to the shelf Id made for it.Then I hooked it up to the feed lines that led through the balloon to the inside of the trailers pressure vessel.The regulator needs to send air to the AREC, then the return air needs to bubble through the heat reservoir.The regulator also needs a pressure tank to contain the CO2 it pulls from the air.When gutting the trailer to make room, I left one tank in place for this.Its supposed to hold oxygen, but a tanks a tank.Thank God all the air lines and valves are standardized across the mission.Thats no mistake.It was a deliberate decision to make field repairs easier.Once I had the AREC in place, I hooked the oxygenator and regulator into the trailers power and watched them power up.I ran both through full diagnostics to confirm they were working correctly.Then I shut down the oxygenator.Remember, Ill only use it one sol out of every five.I moved to the rover, which meant I had to do an annoying ten meter EVA.From there, I monitored the life support situation.Its worth noting that I cant monitor the actual support equipment from the rover (its all in the trailer), but the rover can tell me all about the air.Oxygen, CO2, temperature, humidity, etc.Everything seemed okay.After getting back into the EVA suit, I released a canister of CO2 into the rovers air.I watched the rover computer have a shit fit when it saw the CO2 spike to lethal levels.Then, over time, the levels dropped to normal.The regulator was doing its job.Good boy!I left the equipment running when I returned to the Hab.Itll be on its own all night and Ill check it in the morning.Its not a true test, because Im not there to breathe up the oxygen and make CO2, but one step at a time.LOG ENTRY: SOL 435  Last night was weird.I knew logically that nothing bad would happen in just one night, but it was a little unnerving to know I had no life support other than heaters.My life depended on some math Id done earlier.If I dropped a sign or added two numbers wrong, I might never wake up.But I did wake up, and the main computer showed the slight rise in CO2 I had predicted.Looks like Ill live another sol.Live Another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie.I checked up on the rover.Everything was fine.If I dont drive it, a single charge of the batteries could keep the regulator going for over a month (with the heater off).Its a pretty good safety margin to have.If all hell breaks loose on my trip, Ill have time to fix things.Ill be limited by oxygen consumption rather than CO2 removal, and I have plenty of oxygen.I decided it was a good time to test the bedroom.I got in the rover and attached the bedroom to the outer airlock door from the inside.Like I mentioned before, this is the only way to do it.Then I turned it loose on an unsuspecting Mars.As intended, the pressure from the rover blasted the canvas outward and inflated it.After that, chaos.The sudden pressure popped the bedroom like a balloon.It quickly deflated, leaving both itself and the rover devoid of air.I was wearing my EVA suit at the time; Im not a fucking idiot.So I get to  Live Another Sol!(Starring Mark Watney as probably Q.  Im no James Bond. )I dragged the popped bedroom into the Hab and gave it a good going over.It failed at the seam where the wall met the ceiling.Makes sense.Its a right angle in a pressure vessel.Physics hates that sort of thing.First, I patched it up, then I cut strips of spare canvas to place over the seam.Now it has double thickness and double sealing resin all around.Maybe thatll be enough.At this point, Im kind of guessing.My amazing botany skills arent much use for this.Ill test it again tomorrow.LOG ENTRY: SOL 436  Im out of caffeine pills.No more Martian coffee for me.So it took a little longer for me to wake up this morning, and I quickly developed a splitting headache.One nice thing about living in a multibillion dollar mansion on Mars: access to pure oxygen.For some reason, a high concentration of O2 will kill most headaches.Dont know why.Dont care.The important thing is I dont have to suffer.I tested out the bedroom again.I suited up in the rover and released the bedroom, same as last time.But this time it held.Thats great, but having seen the fragile nature of my handiwork, I wanted a good long test of the pressure seal.After a few minutes standing around in my EVA suit, I decided to make better use of my time.I may not be able to leave the rover/bedroom universe while the bedroom is attached to the airlock, but I can stay in the rover and close the door.Once I did that, I took off the uncomfortable EVA suit.The bedroom was on the other side of the airlock door, still fully pressurized.So Im still running my test, but I dont have to wear the EVA suit.I arbitrarily picked eight hours for the test duration, so I was trapped in the rover until then.I spent my time planning the trip.There wasnt much to add to what I already knew.Ill beeline out of Acidalia Planitia to Mawrth Vallis, then follow the valley until it ends.Itll take me on a zigzag route which will dump me in to Arabia Terra.After that, things get rough.Unlike Acidalia Planitia, Arabia Terra is riddled with craters.And each crater represents two brutal elevation changes.First down, then up.I did my best to find the shortest path around them.Im sure Ill have to adjust the course when Im actually driving it.No plan survives first contact with the enemy.*  Mitch took his seat in the conference room.The usual gang was present: Teddy, Venkat, Mitch, and Annie.But this time there was also Mindy Park, as well as a man Mitch had never seen before.Whats up, Venk?Mitch asked.Why the sudden meeting?Weve got some developments, Venkat said.Mindy, why dont you bring them up to date?Uh, yeah, Mindy said.Looks like Watney finished the balloon addition to the trailer.It mostly uses the design we sent him.Any idea how stable it is?Teddy asked.Pretty stable, she said.Its been inflated for several days with no problems.Also, he built some kind of room.Room?Teddy asked.Its made of Hab canvas, I think, Mindy explained.It attaches to the rovers airlock.I think he cut a section out of the Hab to make it.I dont know what its for.Teddy turned to Venkat.Why would he do that?We think its a workshop, Venkat said.Therell be a lot of work to do on the MAV once he gets to Schiaparelli.Itll be easier without an EVA suit.He probably plans to do as much as he can in that room.Clever, Teddy said.Watneys a clever guy, Mitch said.How about getting life support in there?I think hes done it, Mindy said.He moved the AREC.Sorry, Annie interrupted.Whats an AREC?Its the external component of the atmospheric regulator, Mindy said.It sits outside the Hab, so I saw when it disappeared.He probably mounted it on the rover.Theres no other reason to move it, so Im guessing hes got life support online.Awesome, Mitch said.Things are coming together.Dont celebrate yet, Mitch, Venkat said.He gestured to the newcomer.This is Randall Carter, one of our Martian meteorologists.Randall, tell them what you told me.Randall nodded.Thank you, Dr.Kapoor.He turned his laptop around to show a map of Mars.Over the past few weeks, a dust storm has been developing in Arabia Terra.Not a big deal in terms of magnitude.It wont hinder his driving at all.So whats the problem?Annie asked.Its a low velocity dust storm, Randall explained.Slow winds, but fast enough to pick up very small particles on the surface and whip them into thick clouds.There are five or six of them every year.The thing is, they last for months, they cover huge sections of the planet, and they make the atmosphere thick with dust.I still dont see the problem, Annie said.Light, Randall said.The total sunlight reaching the surface is very low in the area of the storm.Right now, its twenty percent of normal.And Watneys rover is powered by solar panels.Shit, Mitch said, rubbing his eyes.And we cant warn him.So he gets less power, Annie said.Cant he just recharge longer?The current plan already has him recharging all day long, Venkat explained.With twenty percent of normal daylight, itll take five times as long to get the same energy.Itll turn his forty five sol trip into two hundred and twenty five sols.Hell miss the Hermes flyby.Cant Hermes wait for him?Annie asked.Its a flyby, Venkat said.Hermes isnt going into Martian orbit.If they did, they wouldnt be able to get back.They need their velocity for the return trajectory.After a few moments of silence, Teddy said, Well just have to hope he finds a way through.We can track his progress and  No, we cant, Mindy interrupted.We cant?Teddy said.She shook her head.The satellites wont be able to see through the dust.Once he enters the affected area, we wont see anything until he comes out the other side.Well Teddy said.Shit.LOG ENTRY: SOL 439  Before I risk my life with this contraption, I need to test it.And not the little tests Ive been doing so far.Sure, Ive tested power generation, life support, the trailer bubble, and the bedroom.But I need to test all aspects of it working together.Im going to load it up for the long trip and drive in circles.I wont ever be more than 500 meters from the Hab, so Ill be fine if shit breaks.I dedicated today to loading up the rover and trailer for the test.I want the weight to match what itll be on the real trip.Plus if cargo is going to shift around or break things, I want to know about it now.I made one concession to common sense: I left most of my water supply in the Hab.I loaded twenty liters; enough for the test but no more.There are a lot of ways I could lose pressure in this mechanical abomination Ive created, and I dont want all my water to boil off if that happens.On the real trip, Im going to have 620 liters of water.I made up the weight difference by loading 600 kilograms of rocks in with my other supplies.Back on Earth, universities and governments are willing to pay millions to get their hands on Mars rocks.Im using them as ballast.Im doing one more little test tonight.I made sure the batteries were good and full, then disconnected the rover and trailer from Hab power.Ill be sleeping in the Hab, but I left the rovers life support on.Itll maintain the air overnight, and tomorrow Ill see how much power it ate up.Ive watched the power consumption while its attached to the Hab, and there werent any surprises.But thisll be the true proof.I call it the plugs out test.Maybe thats not the best name.*  The crew of Hermes gathered in the Rec.Lets get through status quickly, Lewis said.Were all behind in our science assignments.Vogel, you first.I repaired the bad cable on VASIMR 4, Vogel reported.It was our last thick gauge cable.If another such problem occurs, we will have to braid lower gauge lines to carry the current.Also, the power output from the reactor is declining.Johanssen, Lewis said, whats the deal with the reactor?I had to dial it back, Johanssen said.Its the cooling vanes.They arent radiating heat as well as they used to.Theyre tarnishing.How can that happen?Lewis asked.Theyre outside the craft.Theres nothing for them to react with.I think they picked up dust or small air leaks from Hermes itself.One way or another, theyre definitely tarnishing.The tarnish is clogging the micro lattice, and that reduces the surface area.Less surface area means less heat dissipation.So I limited the reactor enough that we werent getting positive heat.Any chance of repairing the cooling vanes?Its on the microscopic scale, Johanssen said.Wed need a lab.Usually they replace the vanes after each mission.Will we be able to maintain engine power for the rest of the mission?Yes, if the rate of tarnishing doesnt increase.All right, keep an eye on it.Beck, hows life support?Limping, Beck said.Weve been in space way longer than it was designed to handle.There are a bunch of filters that would normally be replaced each mission.I found a way to clean them with a chemical bath I made in the lab, but it eats away at the filters themselves.Were okay right now, but who knows whatll break next?We knew this would happen, Lewis said.The design of Hermes assumed it would get an overhaul after each mission, but weve extended Ares 3 from 396 days to 898.Things are going to break.Weve got all of NASA to help when that happens.We just need to stay on top of maintenance.Martinez, whats the deal with your bunk room?Martinez furrowed his brow.Its still trying to cook me.The climate control just isnt keeping up.I think its the tubing in the walls that brings the coolant.I cant get at it because its built into the hull.We can use the room for storage of non temperature sensitive cargo, but thats about it.So did you move into Marks room?Its right next to mine, he said.It has the same problem.Where have you been sleeping?In Airlock 2.Its the only place I can be without people tripping over me.No good, Lewis said, shaking her head.If one seal breaks, you die.I cant think of anywhere else to sleep, he said.The ship is pretty cramped, and if I sleep in a hallway Ill be in peoples way.Okay, from now on, sleep in Becks room.Beck can sleep with Johanssen.Johanssen blushed and looked down awkwardly.So Beck said, you know about that?You thought I didnt?Lewis said.Its a small ship.Youre not mad?If it were a normal mission, I would be, Lewis said.But were way off script now.Just keep it from interfering with your duties, and Im happy.Million mile high club, Martinez said.Nice!Johanssen blushed deeper and buried her face in her hands.LOG ENTRY: SOL 444  Im getting pretty good at this.Maybe when all this is over I could be a product tester for Mars rovers.Things went well.I spent five sols driving in circles; I averaged 93 kilometers per sol.Thats a little better than Id expected.The terrain here is flat and smooth, so its pretty much a best case scenario.Once Im going up hills and around boulders, it wont be nearly that good.The bedroom is awesome.Large, spacious, and comfortable.On the first night, I ran into a little problem with the temperature.It was fucking cold.The rover and trailer regulate their own temperatures just fine, but things werent hot enough in the bedroom.Story of my life.The rover has an electric heater that pushes air with a small fan.I dont use the heater itself for anything because the RTG provides all the heat I need, so I liberated the fan and wired it into a power line near the airlock.Once it had power, all I had to do was point it at the bedroom.Its a low tech solution, but it worked.Theres plenty of heat, thanks to the RTG.I just needed to get it evenly spread out.For once, entropy was on my side.Ive discovered that raw potatoes are disgusting.When Im in the Hab, I cook my taters using a small microwave.I dont have anything like that in the rover.I could easily bring the Habs microwave into the rover and wire it in, but the energy required to cook ten potatoes a day would actually cut into my driving distance.I fell into a routine pretty quickly.In fact, it was hauntingly familiar.I did it for twenty two miserable sols on the Pathfinder trip.But this time, I had the bedroom and that makes all the difference.Instead of being cooped up in the rover, I have my own little Hab.After waking up, I have a potato for breakfast.Then, I deflate the bedroom from the inside.Its kind of tricky, but I worked out how.First, I put on an EVA suit.Then I close the inner airlock door, leaving the outer door (which the bedroom is attached to) open.This isolates the bedroom, with me in it, from the rest of the rover.Then I tell the airlock to depressurize.It thinks its just pumping the air out of a small area, but its actually deflating the whole bedroom.Once the pressure is gone, I pull the canvas in and fold it.Then I detach it from the outer hatch and close the outer door.This is the most cramped part.I have to share the airlock with the entire folded up bedroom while it repressurizes.Once I have pressure again, I open the inner door and more or less fall into the rover.Then I stow the bedroom and go back to the airlock for a normal egress to Mars.Its a complicated process, but it detaches the bedroom without having to depressurize the rover cabin.Remember, the rover has all my stuff that doesnt play well with vacuum.The next step is to gather up the solar cells I laid out the day before and stow them on the rover and trailer.Then I do a quick check on the trailer.I go in through its airlock and basically take a quick look at all the equipment.I dont even take off my EVA suit.I just want to make sure nothings obviously wrong.Then, back to the rover.Once inside, I take off the EVA suit and start driving.I drive for almost four hours, and then Im out of power.Once I park, its back into the EVA suit for me, and out to Mars again.I lay the solar panels out and get the batteries charging.Then I set up the bedroom.Pretty much the reverse of the sequence I use to stow it.Ultimately, its the airlock that inflates it.In a way, the bedroom is just an extension of the airlock.Even though its possible, I dont rapid inflate the bedroom.I did that to test it because I wanted to find where itll leak.But its not a good idea.Rapid inflation puts a lot of shock and pressure on it.It would eventually rupture.I didnt enjoy that time the Hab launched me like a cannonball.Im not eager to repeat it.Once the bedroom is set up again, I can take off my EVA suit and relax.I mostly watch crappy seventies TV.Im indistinguishable from an unemployed guy for most of the day.I followed that process for four sols, and then it was time for an Air Day.An Air Day turns out to be pretty much the same as any other day, but without the four hour drive.Once I set up the solar panels, I fired up the oxygenator and let it work through the backlog of CO2 that the regulator had stored up.It converted all the CO2 to oxygen and used up the days power generation to do it.The test was a success.Ill be ready on time.LOG ENTRY: SOL 449  Todays the big day.Im leaving for Schiaparelli.The rover and trailer are all packed.Theyve been mostly packed since the test run.But now I even have the water aboard.Over the last few days, I cooked all the potatoes with the Habs microwave.It took quite a while, because the microwave can only hold four at a time.After cooking, I put them back out on the surface to freeze.Once frozen, I put them back in the rovers saddlebags.This may seem like a waste of time, but its critical.Instead of eating raw potatoes during my trip, Ill be eating (cold) precooked potatoes.First off, theyll taste a lot better.But more important, theyll be cooked.When you cook food, the proteins break down, and the food becomes easier to digest.Ill get more calories out of it, and I need every calorie I can get my hands on.I spent the last several days running full diagnostics on everything.The regulator, oxygenator, RTG, AREC, batteries, rover life support (in case I need a backup), solar cells, rover computer, airlocks, and everything else with a moving part or electronic component.I even checked each of the motors.Eight in all, one for each wheel, four on the rover, four on the trailer.The trailers motors wont be powered, but its nice to have backups.Its all good to go.No problems that I can see.The Hab is a shell of its former self.Ive robbed it of all critical components and a big chunk of its canvas.Ive looted that poor Hab for everything it could give me, and in return its kept me alive for a year and a half.Its like the Giving Tree.I performed the final shutdown today.The heaters, lighting, main computer, etc.All the components I didnt steal for the trip to Schiaparelli.I could have left them on.Its not like anyone would care.But the original procedure for Sol 31 (which was supposed to be the last day of the surface mission) was to completely shut down the Hab and deflate it, because NASA didnt want a big tent full of combustible oxygen next to the MAV when it launched.I guess I did the shutdown as an homage to the mission Ares 3 could have been.A small piece of the Sol 31 I never got to have.Once Id shut everything down, the interior of the Hab was eerily silent.Id spent 449 sols listening to its heaters, vents, and fans.But now it was dead quiet.It was a creepy kind of quiet thats hard to describe.Ive been away from the noises of the Hab before, but always in a rover or an EVA suit, both of which have noisy machinery of their own.But now there was nothing.I never realized how utterly silent Mars is.Its a desert world with practically no atmosphere to convey sound.I could hear my own heartbeat.Anyway, enough waxing philosophical.Im in the rover right now.(That should be obvious, with the Hab main computer offline forever. )Ive got two full batteries, all systems are go, and Ive got forty five sols of driving ahead of me.Schiaparelli or bust!Chapter 22      LOG ENTRY: SOL 458  Mawrth Vallis!Im finally here!Actually, its not an impressive accomplishment.Ive only been traveling ten sols.But its a good psychological milestone.So far, the rover and my ghetto life support are working admirably.At least, as well as can be expected for equipment being used ten times longer than intended.Today is my second Air Day (the first was five sols ago).When I put this scheme together, I figured Air Days would be godawful boring.But now I look forward to them.Theyre my days off.On a normal day, I get up, fold up the bedroom, stack the solar cells, drive four hours, set up the solar cells, unfurl the bedroom, check all my equipment (especially the rover chassis and wheels), then make a Morse code status report for NASA, if I can find enough nearby rocks.On an Air Day, I wake up and turn on the oxygenator.The solar panels are already out from the day before.Everythings ready to go.Then I chill out in the bedroom or rover.I have the whole day to myself.The bedroom gives me enough space that I dont feel cooped up, and the computer has plenty of shitty TV reruns for me to enjoy.Technically, I entered Mawrth Vallis yesterday.But I only knew that by looking at a map.The entrance to the valley is wide enough that I couldnt see the canyon walls in either direction.But now Im definitely in a canyon.And the bottom is nice and flat.Exactly what I was hoping for.Its amazing; this valley wasnt made by a river slowly carving it away.It was made by a mega flood in a single day.It would have been a hell of a thing to see.Weird thought: Im not in Acidalia Planitia anymore.I spent 457 sols there, almost a year and a half, and Ill never go back.I wonder if Ill be nostalgic about that later in life.If there is a later in life, Ill be happy to endure a little nostalgia.But for now, I just want to go home.*  Welcome back to CNNs Mark Watney Report, Cathy said to the camera.Were speaking with our frequent guest, Dr.Venkat Kapoor.Dr.Kapoor, I guess what people want to know is, is Mark Watney doomed?We hope not, Venkat responded, but hes got a real challenge ahead of him.According to your latest satellite data, the dust storm in Arabia Terra isnt abating at all, and will block eighty percent of the sunlight?Thats correct.And Watneys only source of energy is his solar panels, correct?Yes, thats right.Can his makeshift rover operate at twenty percent power?We havent found any way to make that happen, no.His life support alone takes more energy than that.How long until he enters the storm?Hes just entered Mawrth Vallis now.At his current rate of travel, hell be at the edge of the storm on Sol 471.Thats twelve days from now.Surely hell see something is wrong, Cathy said.With such low visibility, it wont take long for him to realize his solar cells will have a problem.Couldnt he just turn around at that point?Unfortunately, everythings working against him, Venkat said.The edge of the storm isnt a magic line.Its just an area where the dust gets a little more dense.Itll keep getting more and more dense as he travels onward.Itll be really subtle; every day will be slightly darker than the last.Too subtle to notice.Venkat sighed.Hell go hundreds of kilometers, wondering why his solar panel efficiency is going down, before he notices any visibility problems.And the storm is moving west as he moves east.Hell be too deep in to get out.Are we just watching a tragedy play out?Cathy asked.Theres always hope, Venkat said.Maybe hell figure it out faster than we think and turn around in time.Maybe the storm will dissipate unexpectedly.Maybe hell find a way to keep his life support going on less energy than we thought was possible.Mark Watney is now an expert at surviving on Mars.If anyone can do it, its him.Twelve days, Cathy said to the camera.All of Earth is watching but powerless to help.LOG ENTRY: SOL 462  Another uneventful sol.Tomorrow is an Air Day, so this is kind of my Friday night.Im about halfway through Mawrth Vallis now.Just as Id hoped, the going has been easy.No major elevation changes.Hardly any obstacles.Just smooth sand with rocks smaller than half a meter.You may be wondering how I navigate.When I went to Pathfinder, I watched Phobos transit the sky to figure out the east west axis.But Pathfinder was an easy trip compared to this, and I had plenty of landmarks to navigate by.I cant get away with that this time.My map (such as it is) consists of satellite images far too low resolution to be of any use.I can only see major landmarks, like craters 50 kilometers across.They just never expected me to be out this far.The only reason I had high res images of the Pathfinder region is because they were included for landing purposes; in case Martinez had to land way long of our target.So this time around, I needed a reliable way to fix my position on Mars.Latitude and longitude.Thats the key.The first is easy.Ancient sailors on Earth figured that one out right away.Earths 23.5 degree axis points at Polaris.Mars has a tilt of just over 25 degrees, so its pointed at Deneb.Making a sextant isnt hard.All you need is a tube to look through, a string, a weight, and something with degree markings.I made mine in under an hour.So I go out every night with a homemade sextant and sight Deneb.Its kind of silly if you think about it.Im in my space suit on Mars and Im navigating with sixteenth century tools.But hey, they work.Longitude is a different matter.On Earth, the earliest way to work out longitude required them to know the exact time, then compare it to the suns position in the sky.The hard part for them back then was inventing a clock that would work on a boat (pendulums dont work on boats).All the top scientific minds of the age worked on the problem.Fortunately, I have accurate clocks.There are four computers in my immediate line of sight right now.And I have Phobos.Because Phobos is ridiculously close to Mars, it orbits the planet in less than one Martian day.It travels west to east (unlike the sun and Deimos) and sets every eleven hours.And naturally, it moves in a very predictable pattern.I spend thirteen hours every sol just sitting around while the solar panels charge the batteries.Phobos is guaranteed to set at least once during that time.I note the time when it does.Then I plug it into a nasty formula I worked out and I know my longitude.So working out longitude requires Phobos to set, and working out latitude requires it to be night so I can sight Deneb.Its not a very fast system.But I only need it once a day.I work out my location when Im parked, and account for it in the next days travel.Its kind of a successive approximation thing.So far, I think its been working.But who knows?I can see it now: me holding a map, scratching my head, trying to figure out how I ended up on Venus.*  Mindy Park zoomed in on the latest satellite photo with practiced ease.Watneys encampment was visible in the center, the solar cells laid out in a circular pattern as was his habit.The workshop was inflated.Checking the time stamp on the image, she saw it was from noon local time.She quickly found the status report; Watney always placed it close to the rover when rocks were in abundance, usually to the north.To save time, Mindy had taught herself Morse code, so she wouldnt have to look each letter up every morning.She opened an e mail and addressed it to the ever growing list of people who wanted Watneys daily status message.ON TRACK FOR SOL 494 ARRIVAL.She frowned and added Note: five sols until dust storm entry.LOG ENTRY: SOL 466  Mawrth Vallis was fun while it lasted.Im in Arabia Terra now.I just entered the edge of it, if my latitude and longitude calculations are correct.But even without the math, its pretty obvious the terrain is changing.For the last two sols, Ive spent almost all my time on an incline, working my way up the back wall of Mawrth Vallis.It was a gentle rise, but a constant one.Im at a much higher altitude now.Acidalia Planitia (where the lonely Hab is hanging out) is 3000 meters below elevation zero, and Arabia Terra is 500 meters below.So Ive gone up two and a half kilometers.Want to know what elevation zero means?On Earth, its sea level.Obviously, that wont work on Mars.So lab coated geeks got together and decided Marss elevation zero is wherever the air pressure is 610.5 pascals.Thats about 500 meters up from where I am right now.Now things get tricky.Back in Acidalia Planitia, if I got off course, I could just point in the right direction based on new data.Later, in Mawrth Vallis, it was impossible to screw up.I just had to follow the canyon.Now Im in a rougher neighborhood.The kind of neighborhood where you keep your rover doors locked and never come to a complete stop at intersections.Well, not really, but its bad to get off course here.Arabia Terra has large, brutal craters that I have to drive around.If I navigate poorly, Ill end up at the edge of one.I cant just drive down one side and up the other.Rising in elevation costs a ton of energy.On flat ground, I can make 90 kilometers per day.On a steep slope, Id be lucky to get 40 kilometers.Plus, driving on a slope is dangerous.One mistake and I could roll the rover.I dont even want to think about that.Yes, Ill eventually have to drive down into Schiaparelli.No way around that.Ill have to be really careful.Anyway, if I end up at the edge of a crater, Ill have to backtrack to somewhere useful.And its a damn maze of craters out here.Ill have to be on my guard, observant at all times.Ill need to navigate with landmarks as well as latitude and longitude.My first challenge is to pass between the craters Rutherford and Trouvelot.It shouldnt be too hard.Theyre 100 kilometers apart.Even I cant fuck that up, right?Right?LOG ENTRY: SOL 468  I managed to thread the needle between Rutherford and Trouvelot nicely.Admittedly, the needle was 100 kilometers wide, but hey.Im now enjoying my fourth Air Day of the trip.Ive been on the road for twenty sols.So far, Im right on schedule.According to my maps, Ive traveled 1440 kilometers.Not quite halfway there, but almost.Ive been gathering soil and rock samples from each place I camp.I did the same thing on my way to Pathfinder.But this time, I know NASAs watching me.So Im labeling each sample by the current sol.Theyll know my location a hell of a lot more accurately than I do.They can correlate the samples with their locations later.It might be a wasted effort.The MAV isnt going to have much weight allowance when I launch.To intercept Hermes, itll have to reach escape velocity, but it was only designed to get to orbit.The only way to get it going fast enough is to lose a lot of weight.At least that jury rigging will be NASAs job to work out, not mine.Once I get to the MAV, Ill be back in contact with them and they can tell me what modifications to make.Theyll probably say, Thanks for gathering samples.But leave them behind.And one of your arms, too.Whichever one you like least.But on the off chance I can bring the samples, Im gathering them.The next few days travel should be easy.The next major obstacle is Marth Crater.Its right in my straight line path toward Schiaparelli.Itll cost me a hundred kilometers or so to go around, but it cant be helped.Ill try to aim for the southern edge.The closer I get to the rim the less time Ill waste going around it.*  Did you read todays updates?Lewis asked, pulling her meal from the microwave.Yeah, Martinez said, sipping his drink.She sat across the Rec table from him and carefully opened the steaming package.She decided to let it cool a bit before eating.Mark entered the dust storm yesterday.Yeah, I saw that, he said.We need to face the possibility that he wont make it to Schiaparelli, Lewis said.If that happens, we need to keep morale up.We still have a long way to go before we get home.He was dead before, Martinez said.It was rough on morale, but we soldiered on.Besides, he wont die.Its pretty bleak, Rick, Lewis said.Hes already fifty kilometers into the storm, and hell go another ninety kilometers per sol.Hell get in too deep to recover soon.Martinez shook his head.Hell pull through, Commander.Have faith.She smiled forlornly.Rick, you know Im not religious.I know, he said.Im not talking about faith in God, Im talking about faith in Mark Watney.Look at all the shit Mars has thrown at him, and hes still alive.Hell survive this.I dont know how, but he will.Hes a clever son of a bitch.Lewis took a bite of her food.I hope youre right.Want to bet a hundred bucks?Martinez said with a smile.Of course not, Lewis said.Damn right, he smiled.Id never bet on a crewmate dying, Lewis said.But that doesnt mean I think hell  Blah blah blah, Martinez interrupted.Deep down, you think hell make it.LOG ENTRY: SOL 473  My fifth Air Day, and things are going well.I should be skimming south of Marth Crater tomorrow.Itll get easier after that.Im in the middle of a bunch of craters that form a triangle.Im calling it the Watney Triangle because after what Ive been through, stuff on Mars should be named after me.Trouvelot, Becquerel, and Marth form the points of the triangle, with five other major craters along the sides.Normally this wouldnt be a problem at all, but with my extremely rough navigation, I could easily end up at the lip of one of them and have to backtrack.After Marth, Ill be out of the Watney Triangle (yeah, Im liking that name more and more).Then I can beeline toward Schiaparelli with impunity.Therell still be plenty of craters in the way, but theyre comparatively small, and going around them wont cost much time.Progress has been great.Arabia Terra is certainly rockier than Acidalia Planitia, but nowhere near as bad as Id feared.Ive been able to drive over most of the rocks, and around the ones that are too big.I have 1435 kilometers left to go.I did some research on Schiaparelli and found some good news.The best way in is right in my direct line path.I wont have to drive the perimeter at all.And the way in is easy to find, even when you suck at navigating.The northwest rim has a smaller crater on it, and thats the landmark Ill be looking for.To the southwest of that little crater is a gentle slope into Schiaparelli Basin.The little crater doesnt have a name.At least, not on the maps I have.So I dub it Entrance Crater.Because I can.In other news, my equipment is starting to show signs of age.Not surprising, considering its way the hell past its expiration date.For the past two sols, the batteries have taken longer to recharge.The solar cells just arent producing as much wattage as before.Its not a big deal, I just need to charge a little longer.LOG ENTRY: SOL 474  Well, I fucked it up.It was bound to happen eventually.I navigated badly and ended up at the ridge of Marth Crater.Because its 100 kilometers wide, I cant see the whole thing, so I dont know where on the circle I am.The ridge runs perpendicular to the direction I was going.So I have no clue which way I should go.And I dont want to take the long way around if I can avoid it.Originally I wanted to go around to the south, but north is just as likely to be the best path now that Im off course.Ill have to wait for another Phobos transit to get my longitude, and Ill need to wait for nightfall to sight Deneb for my latitude.So Im done driving for the day.Luckily Id made 70 kilometers out of the 90 kilometers I usually do, so its not too much wasted progress.Marth isnt too steep.I could probably just drive down one side and up the other.Its big enough that Id end up camping inside it one night.But I dont want to take unnecessary risks.Slopes are bad and should be avoided.I gave myself plenty of buffer time, so Im going to play it safe.Im ending todays drive early and setting up for recharge.Probably a good idea anyway with the solar cells acting up; itll give them more time to work.They underperformed again last night.I checked all the connections and made sure there wasnt any dust on them, but they still just arent 100 percent.LOG ENTRY: SOL 475  Im in trouble.
