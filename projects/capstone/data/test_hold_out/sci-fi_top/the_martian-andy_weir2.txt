The atmospheric pressure was going to be fine.All I needed was oxygen.So I grabbed an O2 canister and breather mask from the medical bay.That way, I had a hell of a lot more freedom of motion.It even had a rubber band to keep it on my face!Though I did need a space suit to monitor the actual Hab oxygen level, now that the Habs main computer was convinced it was 100 percent O2.Lets see Martinezs space suit was in the rover.Johanssens was outwitting the regulator.Lewiss was serving as a water tank.I didnt want to mess with mine (hey, its custom fitted!).That left me two space suits to work with.I grabbed Vogels suit and activated the internal air sensors while leaving the helmet off.Once the oxygen dropped to 12 percent, I put the breather mask on.I watched it fall further and further.When it reached 1 percent, I cut power to the regulator.I may not be able to reprogram the regulator, but I can turn the bastard off completely.The Hab has emergency flashlights in many locations in case of critical power failure.I tore the LED bulbs out of one and left the two frayed power wires very close together.Now, when I turned it on, I got a small spark.Taking a canister of O2 from Vogels suit, I attached a strap to both ends and slung it over my shoulder.Then I attached an air line to the tank and crimped it with my thumb.I turned on a very slow trickle of O2; small enough that it couldnt overpower the crimp.Standing on the table with a sparker in one hand and my oxygen line in the other, I reached up and gave it a try.And holy hell, it worked!Blowing the O2 over the sparker, I flicked the switch on the flashlight and a wonderful jet of flame fired out of the tube.The fire alarm went off, of course.But Id heard it so much lately, I barely noticed it anymore.Then I did it again.And again.Short bursts.Nothing flashy.I was happy to take my time.I was elated!This was the best plan ever!Not only was I clearing out the hydrogen, I was making more water!Everything went great right up to the explosion.One minute I was happily burning hydrogen; the next I was on the other side of the Hab, and a lot of stuff was knocked over.I stumbled to my feet and saw the Hab in disarray.My first thought was: My ears hurt like hell!Then I thought, Im dizzy, and fell to my knees.Then I fell prone.I was that dizzy.I groped my head with both hands, looking for a head wound I desperately hoped would not be there.Nothing seemed to be amiss.But feeling all over my head and face revealed the true problem.My oxygen mask had been ripped off in the blast.I was breathing nearly pure nitrogen.The floor was covered in junk from all over the Hab.No hope of finding the medical O2 tank.No hope of finding anything in this mess before I passed out.Then I saw Lewiss suit hanging right where it belonged.It hadnt moved in the blast.It was heavy to start with and had 70 liters of water in it.I rushed over, quickly cranked on the O2, and stuck my head into the neck hole (Id removed the helmet long ago, for easy access to the water).I breathed a bit until the dizziness faded, then took a deep breath and held it.Still holding my breath, I glanced over to the space suit and Hefty bag Id used to outsmart the regulator.The bad news is Id never removed them.The good news is the explosion removed them.Eight of the nine intakes for the regulator were still bagged, but this one would at least tell the truth.Stumbling over to the regulator, I turned it back on.After a two second boot process (it was made to start up fast for obvious reasons), it immediately identified the problem.The shrill low oxygen alarm blared throughout the Hab as the regulator dumped pure oxygen into the atmosphere as fast as it safely could.Separating oxygen from the atmosphere is difficult and time consuming, but adding it is as simple as opening a valve.I clambered over debris back to Lewiss space suit and put my head back in for more good air.Within three minutes, the regulator had brought the Hab oxygen back up to par.I noticed for the first time how burned my clothing was.It was a good time to be wearing three layers of clothes.Mostly the damage was on my sleeves.The outer layer was gone.The middle layer was singed and burned clean through in places.The inner layer, my own uniform, was in reasonably good shape.Looks like I lucked out again.Also, glancing at the Habs main computer, I saw the temperature had gone up to 15C.Something very hot and very explodey had happened, and I wasnt sure what.Or how.And thats where I am now.Wondering what the hell happened.After all that work and getting blown up, Im exhausted.Tomorrow Ill have to do a million equipment checks and try to figure out what exploded, but for now I just want to sleep.Im in the rover again tonight.Even with the hydrogen gone, Im reluctant to hang out in a Hab that has a history of exploding for no reason.Plus, I cant be sure there isnt a leak.This time, I brought a proper meal, and something to listen to that isnt disco.LOG ENTRY: SOL 41  I spent the day running full diagnostics on every system in the Hab.It was incredibly boring, but my survival depends on these machines, so it had to be done.I cant just assume an explosion did no long term damage.I did the most critical tests first.Number one was the integrity of the Hab canvas.I felt pretty confident it was in good shape, because Id spent a few hours asleep in the rover before returning to the Hab, and the pressure was still good.The computer reported no change in pressure over that time, other than a minor fluctuation based on temperature.Then I checked the oxygenator.If that stops working and I cant fix it, Im a dead man.No problems.Then the atmospheric regulator.Again, no problem.Heating unit, primary battery array, O2 and N2 storage tanks, water reclaimer, all three airlocks, lighting systems, main computer on and on I went, feeling better and better as each system proved to be in perfect working order.Got to hand it to NASA.They dont screw around when making this stuff.Then came the critical part checking the dirt.I took a few samples from all over the Hab (remember, its all dirt flooring now) and made slides.With shaking hands, I put a slide into the microscope and brought the image up on screen.There they were!Healthy, active bacteria doing their thing!Looks like I wont be starving to death on Sol 400 after all.I plopped down in a chair and let my breathing return to normal.Then I set about cleaning up the mess.And I had a lot of time to think about what had happened.So what happened?Well, I have a theory.According to the main computer, during the blast, the internal pressure spiked to 1.4 atmospheres, and the temperature rose to 15C in under a second.But the pressure quickly subsided back to 1 atm.This would make sense if the atmospheric regulator were on, but Id cut power to it.The temperature remained at 15C for some time afterward, so any heat expansion should still have been present.But the pressure dropped down again, so where did that extra pressure go?Raising the temperature and keeping the same number of atoms inside should permanently raise the pressure.But it didnt.I quickly realized the answer.The hydrogen (the only available thing to burn) combined with oxygen (hence combustion) and became water.Water is a thousand times as dense as a gas.So the heat added to the pressure, and the transformation of hydrogen and oxygen into water brought it back down again.The million dollar question is, where the hell did the oxygen come from?The whole plan was to limit oxygen and keep an explosion from happening.And it was working for quite a while before blowing up.I think I have my answer.And it comes down to me brain farting.Remember when I decided not to wear a space suit?That decision almost killed me.The medical O2 tank mixes pure oxygen with surrounding air, then feeds it to you through a mask.The mask stays on your face with a little rubber band that goes around the back of your neck.Not an airtight seal.I know what youre thinking.The mask leaked oxygen.But no.I was breathing the oxygen.When I was inhaling, I made a nearly airtight seal with the mask by sucking it to my face.The problem was exhaling.Do you know how much oxygen you absorb out of the air when you take a normal breath?I dont know either, but its not 100 percent.Every time I exhaled, I added more oxygen to the system.It just didnt occur to me.But it should have.If your lungs grabbed up all the oxygen, mouth to mouth resuscitation wouldnt work.Im such a dumb ass for not thinking of it!And my dumb assery almost got me killed!Im really going to have to be more careful.Its a good thing I burned off most of the hydrogen before the explosion.Otherwise that would have been the end.As it is, the explosion wasnt strong enough to pop the Hab.Though it was strong enough to almost blast my eardrums in.This all started with me noticing a 60 liter shortfall in water production.Between deliberate burn off and a bit of unexpected explosion, Im back on track.The water reclaimer did its job last night and pulled 50 liters of the newly created water out of the air.Its storing it in Lewiss spacesuit, which Ill call The Cistern from now on, because it sounds cooler.The other 10 liters of water was directly absorbed by the dry soil.Lots of physical labor today.Ive earned a full meal.And to celebrate my first night back in the Hab, Ill kick back and watch some shitty twentieth century TV courtesy of Commander Lewis.The Dukes of Hazzard, eh?Lets give it a whirl.LOG ENTRY: SOL 42  I slept in late today.I deserved it.After four nights of awful sleep in the rover, my bunk felt like the softest, most profoundly beautiful feather bed ever made.Eventually, I dragged my ass out of bed and finished some post explosion cleanup.I moved the potato plants back in today.And just in time, too.Theyre sprouting.They look healthy and happy.This isnt chemistry, medicine, bacteriology, nutrition analysis, explosion dynamics, or any other shit Ive been doing lately.This is botany.Im sure I can at least grow some plants without screwing up.Right?You know what really sucks?Ive only made 130 liters of water.I have another 470 liters to go.Youd think after almost killing myself twice, Id be able to stop screwing around with hydrazine.But nope.Ill be reducing hydrazine and burning hydrogen in the Hab, every ten hours, for another ten days.Ill do a better job of it from now on.Instead of counting on a clean reaction, Ill do frequent hydrogen cleanings with a small flame.Itll burn off gradually instead of building up to kill Mark levels.Ill have a lot of dead time.Ten hours for each tank of CO2 to finish filling.It only takes twenty minutes to reduce the hydrazine and burn the hydrogen.Ill spend the rest of the time watching TV.And seriously Its clear that General Lee can outrun a police cruiser.Why doesnt Rosco just go to the Duke farm and arrest them when theyre not in the car?Chapter 6   Venkat Kapoor returned to his office, dropped his briefcase on the floor, and collapsed into his leather chair.He took a moment to look out the windows.His office in Building 1 afforded him a commanding view of the large park in the center of the Johnson Space Center complex.Beyond that, dozens of scattered buildings dominated the view all the way to Mud Lake in the distance.Glancing at his computer screen, he noted forty seven unread e mails urgently demanding his attention.They could wait.Today had been a sad day.Today was the memorial service for Mark Watney.The President had given a speech, praising Watneys bravery and sacrifice, and the quick actions of Commander Lewis in getting everyone else to safety.Commander Lewis and the surviving crew, via long range communication from Hermes, gave eulogies for their departed comrade from deep space.They had another ten months of travel yet to endure.The administrator had given a speech as well, reminding everyone that space flight is incredibly dangerous, and that we will not back down in the face of adversity.Theyd asked Venkat if he was willing to make a speech.Hed declined.What was the point?Watney was dead.Nice words from the director of Mars operations wouldnt bring him back.You okay, Venk?came a familiar voice from the doorway.Venkat swiveled around.Guess so, he said.Teddy Sanders swept a rogue thread off his otherwise immaculate blazer.You could have given a speech.I didnt want to.You know that.Yeah, I know.I didnt want to, either.But Im the administrator of NASA.Its kind of expected.You sure youre okay?Yeah, Ill be fine.Good, Teddy said, adjusting his cuff links.Lets get back to work, then.Sure.Venkat shrugged.Lets start with you authorizing my satellite time.Teddy leaned against the wall with a sigh.This again.Yes, Venkat said.This again.What is the problem?Okay, run me through it.What, exactly, are you after?Venkat leaned forward.Ares 3 was a failure, but we can salvage something from it.Were funded for five Ares missions.I think we can get Congress to fund a sixth.I dont know, Venk  Its simple, Teddy.Venkat pressed on.They evacd after six sols.Theres almost an entire missions worth of supplies up there.It would only cost a fraction of a normal mission.It normally takes fourteen presupply probes to prep a site.We might be able to send whats missing in three.Maybe two.Venk, the site got hit by a 175 kph sandstorm.Itll be in really bad shape.Thats why I want imagery, Venkat said.I just need a couple of shots of the site.We could learn a lot.Like what?You think wed send people to Mars without being sure everything was in perfect working order?Everything doesnt have to be perfect, Venkat said quickly.Whatevers broken, wed send replacements for.How will we know from imagery whats broken?Its just a first step.They evacd because the wind was a threat to the MAV, but the Hab can withstand a lot more punishment.It might still be in one piece.And itll be really obvious.If it popped, itd completely blow out and collapse.If its still standing, then everything inside will be fine.And the rovers are solid.They can take any sandstorm Mars has to offer.Just let me take a look, Teddy, thats all I want.Teddy paced to the windows and stared out at the vast expanse of buildings.Youre not the only guy who wants satellite time, you know.We have Ares 4 supply missions coming up.We need to concentrate on Schiaparelli crater.I dont get it, Teddy.Whats the problem here?Venkat asked.Im talking about securing us another mission.We have twelve satellites in orbit around Mars; Im sure you can spare one or two for a couple of hours.I can give you the windows for each one when theyll be at the right angle for Ares 3 shots  Its not about satellite time, Venk, Teddy interrupted.Venkat froze.Then but what  Teddy turned to face him.Were a public domain organization.Theres no such thing as secret or secure information here.So?Any imagery we take goes directly to the public.Again, so?Mark Watneys body will be within twenty meters of the Hab.Maybe partially buried in sand, but still very visible, and with a comm antenna sticking out of his chest.Any images we take will show that.Venkat stared.Then glared.This is why you denied my imagery requests for two months?Venk, come on  Really, Teddy?he said.Youre afraid of a PR problem?The medias obsession with Watneys death is finally starting to taper off, Teddy said evenly.Its been bad press after bad press for two months.Todays memorial gives people closure, and the media can move on to some other story.The last thing we want is to dredge everything back up.So what do we do, then?Hes not going to decompose.Hell be there forever.Not forever, Teddy said.Within a year, hell be covered in sand from normal weather activity.A year?Venkat said, rising to his feet.Thats ludicrous.We cant wait a year for this.Why not?Ares 4 wont even launch for another five years.Plenty of time.Venkat took a deep breath and thought for a moment.Okay, consider this: Sympathy for Watneys family is really high.Ares 6 could bring the body back.We dont say thats the purpose of the mission, but we make it clear that would be part of it.If we framed it that way, wed get more support in Congress.But not if we wait a year.In a year, people wont care anymore.Teddy rubbed his chin.Hmm  *  Mindy Park stared at the ceiling.She had little else to do.The three a. m.  shift was pretty dull.Only a constant stream of coffee kept her awake.Monitoring the status of satellites around Mars had sounded like an exciting proposition when she took the transfer.But the satellites tended to take care of themselves.Her job turned out to be sending e mails as imagery became available.Masters degree in mechanical engineering, she muttered.And Im working in an all night photo booth.She sipped her coffee.A flicker on her screen announced that another set of images was ready for dispatch.She checked the name on the work order.Venkat Kapoor.She posted the data directly to internal servers and composed an e mail to Dr.Kapoor.As she entered the latitude and longitude of the image, she recognized the numbers.31.2N, 28.5W Acidalia Planitia Ares 3?Out of curiosity, she brought up the first of the seventeen images.As shed suspected, it was the Ares 3 site.Shed heard they were going to image it.Slightly ashamed of herself, she scoured the image for any sign of Mark Watneys dead body.After a minute of fruitless searching, she was simultaneously relieved and disappointed.She moved on to perusing the rest of the image.The Hab was intact; Dr.Kapoor would be happy to see that.She brought the coffee mug to her lips, then froze.Um she mumbled to herself.Uhhh  She brought up the NASA intranet and navigated through the site to the specifics of the Ares missions.After some quick research, she picked up her phone.Hey, this is Mindy Park at SatCon.I need the mission logs for Ares 3, where can I get em?Uh huh uh huh Okay Thanks.After some more time on the intranet, she leaned back in her seat.She no longer needed the coffee to keep awake.Picking up the phone again, she said, Hello, Security?This is Mindy Park in SatCon.I need the emergency contact number for Dr.Venkat Kapoor Yes its an emergency.*  Mindy fidgeted in her seat as Venkat trudged in.To have the director of Mars operations visiting SatCon was unusual.Seeing him in jeans and a T shirt was even more unusual.You Mindy Park?he asked with the scowl of a man operating on two hours of sleep.Yes, she quavered.Sorry to drag you in.Im assuming you had a good reason.So?Um, she said, looking down.Um, its.Well.The imagery you ordered.Um.Come here and look.He pulled another chair to her station and seated himself.Is this about Watneys body?Is that why youre shook up?Um, no, she said.Um.Wel uh.She winced at her own awkwardness and pointed to the screen.Venkat inspected the image.Looks like the Habs in one piece.Thats good news.Solar array looks good.The rovers are okay, too.Main dish isnt around.No surprise there.Whats the big emergency?Um, she said, touching her finger to the screen.That.Venkat leaned in and looked closer.Just below the Hab, beside the rovers, two white circles sat in the sand.Hmm.Looks like Hab canvas.Maybe the Hab didnt do well after all?I guess pieces got torn off and  Um, she interrupted.They look like rover pop tents.Venkat looked again.Hmm.Probably right.Howd they get set up?Mindy asked.Venkat shrugged.Commander Lewis probably ordered them deployed during the evac.Not a bad idea.Have the emergency shelters ready in case the MAV didnt work and the Hab breached.Yeah, um, Mindy said, opening a document on her computer, this is the entire mission log for Sols 1 through 6.From MDV touchdown to MAV emergency liftoff.Okay, and?I read through it.Several times.They never threw out the pop tents.Her voice cracked at the last word.Well, uh Venkat said, furrowing his brow.They obviously did, but it didnt make it into the log.They activated two emergency pop tents and never told anyone?Hmm.That doesnt make a lot of sense, no.Maybe the storm messed with the rovers and the tents autodeployed.So after autodeploying, they detached themselves from the rovers and lined up next to each other twenty meters away?Venkat looked back to the image.Well obviously they activated somehow.Why are the solar cells clean?Mindy said, fighting back tears.There was a huge sandstorm.Why isnt there sand all over them?A good wind could have done it?Venkat said, unsure.Did I mention I never found Watneys body?she said, sniffling.Venkats eyes widened as he stared at the picture.Oh he said quietly.Oh God  Mindy put her hands over her face and sobbed quietly.*  Fuck!Annie Montrose said.You have got to be fucking kidding me!Teddy glared across his immaculate mahogany desk at his director of media relations.Not helping, Annie.He turned to his director of Mars operations.How sure are we of this?Nearly a hundred percent, Venkat said.Fuck!Annie said.Teddy moved a folder on his desk slightly to the right so it would line up with his mouse pad.It is what it is.We have to deal with it.Do you have any idea the magnitude of shit storm this is gonna be?she retorted.You dont have to face those damn reporters every day.I do!One thing at a time, Teddy said.Venk, what makes you sure hes alive?For starters, no body, Venkat explained.Also, the pop tents are set up.And the solar cells are clean.You can thank Mindy Park in SatCon for noticing all that, by the way.But, Venkat continued, his body could have been buried in the Sol 6 storm.The pop tents might have autodeployed and wind could have blown them around.A 30 kph windstorm some time later would have been strong enough to clean the solar cells but not strong enough to carry sand.Its not likely, but its possible.So I spent the last few hours checking everything I could.Commander Lewis had two outings in Rover 2.The second was on Sol 5.According to the logs, after returning, she plugged it into the Hab for recharging.It wasnt used again, and thirteen hours later they evacd.He slid a picture across the desk to Teddy.Thats one of the images from last night.As you can see, Rover 2 is facing away from the Hab.The charging port is in the nose, and the cable isnt long enough to reach.Teddy absently rotated the picture to be parallel with the edges of his desk.She must have parked it facing the Hab or she wouldnt have been able to plug it in, he said.Its been moved since Sol 5.Yeah, Venkat said, sliding another picture to Teddy.But heres the real evidence.In the lower right of the image you can see the MDV.Its been taken apart.Im pretty sure they wouldnt have done that without telling us.And the clincher is on the right of the image, Venkat pointed.The landing struts of the MAV.Looks like the fuel plant has been completely removed, with considerable damage to the struts in the process.Theres just no way that could have happened before liftoff.It would have endangered the MAV way too much for Lewis to allow it.Hey, Annie said.Why not talk to Lewis?Lets go to CAPCOM and ask her directly.Rather than answer, Venkat looked to Teddy knowingly.Because, Teddy said, if Watney really is alive, we dont want the Ares 3 crew to know.What!?Annie said.How can you not tell them?They have another ten months on their trip home, Teddy explained.Space travel is dangerous.They need to be alert and undistracted.Theyre sad that they lost a crewmate, but theyd be devastated if they found out theyd abandoned him alive.Annie looked to Venkat.Youre on board with this?Its a no brainer, Venkat said.Let em deal with that emotional trauma when theyre not flying a spaceship around.Thisll be the most talked about event since Apollo 11, Annie said.How will you keep it from them?Teddy shrugged.Easy.We control all communication with them.Fuck, Annie said, opening her laptop.When do you want to go public?Whats your take?he asked.Mmm, Annie said.We can hold the pics for twenty four hours before were required to release them.Well need to send out a statement along with them.We dont want people working it out on their own.Wed look like assholes.Okay, Teddy agreed, put together a statement.Thatll be fun, she grumbled.Where do we go from here?Teddy asked Venkat.Step one is communication, Venkat said.From the pics, its clear the comm array is ruined.We need another way to talk.Once we can talk, we can assess and make plans.All right, Teddy said.Get on it.Take anyone you want from any department.Use as much overtime as you want.Find a way to talk to him.Thats your only job right now.Got it.Annie, make sure nobody gets wind of this till we announce.Right, Annie said.Who else knows?Just the three of us and Mindy Park in SatCon, Venkat said.Ill have a word with her, Annie said.Teddy stood and opened his cell phone.Im going to Chicago.Ill be back tomorrow.Why?Annie asked.Thats where Watneys parents live, Teddy said.I owe them a personal explanation before it breaks on the news.Theyll be happy to hear their sons alive, Annie said.Yes, hes alive, Teddy said.But if my math is right, hes doomed to starve to death before we can possibly help him.Im not looking forward to the conversation.Fuck, Annie said, thoughtfully.*  Nothing?Nothing at all?Venkat groaned.Are you kidding me?You had twenty experts working for twelve hours on this.We have a multibillion dollar communications network.You cant figure out any way to talk to him?The two men in Venkats office fidgeted in their chairs.Hes got no radio, said Chuck.Actually, said Morris, hes got a radio, but he doesnt have a dish.Thing is, Chuck continued, without the dish, a signal would have to be really strong  Like, melting the pigeons strong, Morris supplied.for him to get it, Chuck finished.We considered Martian satellites, Morris said.Theyre way closer.But the math doesnt work out.Even SuperSurveyor 3, which has the strongest transmitter, would need to be fourteen times more powerful  Seventeen times, Chuck said.Fourteen times, Morris asserted.No, its seventeen.You forgot the amperage minimum for the heaters to keep the  Guys, Venkat interrupted, I get the idea.Sorry.Sorry.Sorry if Im grumpy, Venkat said.I got like two hours sleep last night.No problem, Morris said.Totally understandable, Chuck said.Okay, Venkat said.Explain to me how a single windstorm removed our ability to talk to Ares 3.Failure of imagination, Chuck said.Totally didnt see it coming, Morris agreed.How many backup communications systems does an Ares mission have?Venkat asked.Four, Chuck said.Three, Morris said.No, its four, Chuck corrected.He said backup systems, Morris insisted.That means not including the primary system.Oh right.Three.So four systems total, then, Venkat said.Explain how we lost all four.Well, Chuck said, The primary ran through the big satellite dish.It blew away in the storm.The rest of the backups were in the MAV.Yup, Morris agreed.The MAV is, like, a communicating machine.It can talk to Earth, Hermes, even satellites around Mars if it has to.And it has three independent systems to make sure nothing short of a meteor strike can stop communication.Problem is, Chuck said, Commander Lewis and the rest of them took the MAV when they left.So four independent communications systems became one.And that one broke, Morris finished.Venkat pinched the bridge of his nose.How could we overlook this?Chuck shrugged.Never occurred to us.We never thought someone would be on Mars without an MAV.I mean, come on!Morris said.What are the odds?Chuck turned to him.One in three, based on empirical data.Thats pretty bad if you think about it.*  This was going to be rough and Annie knew it.Not only did she have to deliver the biggest mea culpa in NASAs history, every second of it would be remembered forever.Every movement of her arms, intonation of her voice, and expression on her face would be seen by millions of people over and over again.Not just in the immediate press cycle, but for decades to come.Every documentary made about Watneys situation would have this clip.She was confident that none of that concern showed on her face as she took to the podium.Thank you all for coming on such short notice, she said to the assembled reporters.We have an important announcement to make.If you could all take your seats.What this about, Annie?Bryan Hess from NBC asked.Something happen with Hermes?Please take your seats, Annie repeated.The reporters milled about and argued over seats for a brief time, then finally settled down.This is a short but very important announcement, Annie said.I wont be taking any questions at this time, but we will have a full press conference with Q&A in about an hour.We have recently reviewed satellite imagery from Mars and have confirmed that astronaut Mark Watney is, currently, still alive.After one full second of utter silence, the room exploded with noise.*  A week after the stunning announcement, it was still the top story on every news network in the world.Im getting sick of daily press conferences, Venkat whispered to Annie.Im getting sick of hourly press conferences, Annie whispered back.The two stood with countless other NASA managers and executives bunched up on the small stage in the press room.They faced a pit of hungry reporters, all desperate for any scrap of new information.Sorry Im late, Teddy said, entering from the side door.He pulled some flash cards from his pocket, squared them in his hands, then cleared his throat.In the nine days since announcing Mark Watneys survival, weve received a massive show of support from all sectors.Were using this shamelessly every way we can.A small chuckle cascaded through the room.Yesterday, at our request, the entire SETI network focused on Mars.Just in case Watney was sending a weak radio signal.Turns out he wasnt, but it shows the level of commitment everyone has toward helping us.The public is engaged, and we will do our best to keep everyone informed.Ive recently learned CNN will be dedicating a half hour segment every weekday to reporting on just this issue.We will assign several members of our media relations team to that program, so the public can get the latest information as fast as possible.We have adjusted the orbits of three satellites to get more view time on the Ares 3 site and hope to catch an image of Mark outside soon.If we can see him outside, we will be able to draw conclusions on his physical health based on stance and activities.The questions are many: How long can he last?How much food does he have?Can Ares 4 rescue him?How will we talk to him?The answers to these questions are not what we want to hear.I cant promise well succeed in rescuing him, but I can promise this: The entire focus of NASA will be to bring Mark Watney home.This will be our overriding and singular obsession until he is either back on Earth or confirmed dead on Mars.*  Nice speech, Venkat said as he entered Teddys office.Meant every word of it, Teddy said.Oh, I know.What can I do for you, Venk?Ive got an idea.Well, JPL has an idea.Im the messenger.I like ideas, Teddy said, gesturing to a seat.Venkat sat down.We can rescue him with Ares 4.Its very risky.We ran the idea by the Ares 4 crew.Not only are they willing to do it, but now theyre really pushing hard for it.Naturally, Teddy said.Astronauts are inherently insane.And really noble.Whats the idea?Well, Venkat began, its in the rough stages, but JPL thinks the MDV can be misused to save him.Ares 4 hasnt even launched yet.Why misuse an MDV?Why not make something better?We dont have time to make a custom craft.Actually, he cant even survive till Ares 4 gets there, but thats a different problem.So tell me about the MDV.JPL strips it down, loses some weight, and adds some fuel tanks.Ares 4s crew lands at the Ares 3 site, very efficiently.Then, with a full burn, and I mean a full burn, they can lift off again.It cant get back to orbit, but it can go to the Ares 4 site on a lateral trajectory thats, well, really scary.Then they have an MAV.How are they losing weight?Teddy asked.Dont they already have it as light as it can be?By removing safety and emergency equipment.Wonderful, Teddy said.So wed be risking the lives of six more people.Yup, Venkat said.It would be safer to leave the Ares 4 crew in Hermes and only send the pilot down with the MDV.But that would mean giving up the mission, and theyd rather risk death.Theyre astronauts, Teddy said.Theyre astronauts, Venkat confirmed.Well.Thats a ludicrous idea and Ill never okay it.Well work on it some more, Venkat said.Try to make it safer.Do that.Any idea how to keep him alive for four years?Nope.Work on that, too.Will do, Venkat said.Teddy swiveled his chair and looked out the window to the sky beyond.Night was edging in.What must it be like?he pondered.Hes stuck out there.He thinks hes totally alone and that we all gave up on him.What kind of effect does that have on a mans psychology?He turned back to Venkat.I wonder what hes thinking right now.LOG ENTRY: SOL 61  How come Aquaman can control whales?Theyre mammals!Makes no sense.Chapter 7      LOG ENTRY: SOL 63  I finished making water some time ago.Im no longer in danger of blowing myself up.The potatoes are growing nicely.Nothing has conspired to kill me in weeks.And seventies TV keeps me disturbingly more entertained than it should.Things are stable here on Mars.Its time to start thinking long term.Even if I find a way to tell NASA Im alive, theres no guarantee theyll be able to save me.I need to be proactive.I need to figure out how to get to Ares 4.Wont be easy.Ares 4 will be landing at the Schiaparelli crater, 3200 kilometers away.In fact, their MAV is already there.I know because I watched Martinez land it.It takes eighteen months for the MAV to make its fuel, so its the first thing NASA sends along.Sending it forty eight months early gives it plenty of extra time in case fuel reactions go slower than expected.But much more importantly, it means a precision soft landing can be done remotely by a pilot in orbit.Direct remote operation from Houston isnt an option; theyre anywhere from four to twenty light minutes away.Ares 4s MAV spent eleven months getting to Mars.It left before us and got here around the same time we did.As expected, Martinez landed it beautifully.It was one of the last things we did before piling into our MDV and heading to the surface.Ahh, the good old days, when I had a crew with me.Im lucky.Thirty two hundred km isnt that bad.It could have been up to 10,000 km away.And because Im on the flattest part of Mars, the first 650 kilometers is nice, smooth terrain (Yay Acidalia Planitia!)but the rest of it is nasty, rugged, crater pocked hell.Obviously, Ill have to use a rover.And guess what?They werent designed for massive overland journeys.This is going to be a research effort, with a bunch of experimentation.Ill have to become my own little NASA, figuring out how to explore far from the Hab.The good news is I have lots of time to figure it out.Almost four years.Some stuff is obvious.Ill need to use a rover.Itll take a long time, so Ill need to bring supplies.Ill need to recharge en route, and rovers dont have solar cells, so Ill need to steal some from the Habs solar farm.During the trip Ill need to breathe, eat, and drink.Lucky for me, the tech specs for everything are right here in the computer.Ill need to trick out a rover.Basically itll have to be a mobile Hab.Ill pick Rover 2 as my target.We have a certain bond, after I spent two days in it during the Great Hydrogen Scare of Sol 37.Theres too much shit to think about all at once.So for now, Ill just think about power.Our mission had a 10 kilometer operational radius.Knowing we wouldnt take straight line paths, NASA designed the rovers to go 35 kilometers on a full charge.That presumes flat, reasonable terrain.Each rover has a 9000 watt hour battery.Step one is to loot Rover 1s battery and install it in Rover 2.Ta daa!I just doubled my full charge range.Theres just one complication.Heating.Part of the battery power goes to heating the rover.Mars is really cold.Normally, we were expected to do all EVAs in under five hours.But Ill be living in it twenty four and a half hours a day.According to the specs, the heating equipment soaks up 400 watts.Keeping it on would eat up 9800 watt hours per day.Over half my power supply, every day!But I do have a free source of heat: me.A couple million years of evolution gave me warm blooded technology.I can just turn off the heater and wear layers.The rover has good insulation, too.Itll have to be enough; I need every bit of power.According to my boring math, moving the rover eats 200 watt hours of juice to go 1 kilometer, so using the full 18,000 watt hours for motion (minus a negligible amount for computer, life support, etc. )gets me 90 kilometers of travel.Now were talkin.Ill never actually get 90 kilometers on a single charge.Ill have hills to deal with, and rough terrain, sand, etc.But its a good ballpark.It tells me that it would take at least 35 days of travel to get to Ares 4.Itll probably be more like 50.But thats plausible, at least.At the rovers blazing 25 kph top speed, itll take me three and a half hours before I run the battery down.I can drive in twilight, and save the sunny part of the day for charging.This time of year I get about thirteen hours of light.How many solar cells will I have to pilfer from the Habs farm?Thanks to the fine taxpayers of America, I have over 100 square meters of the most expensive solar paneling ever made.It has an astounding 10.2 percent efficiency, which is good because Mars doesnt get as much sunlight as Earth.Only 500 to 700 watts per square meter (compared to the 1400 Earth gets).Long story short: I need to bring twenty eight square meters of solar cell.Thats fourteen panels.I can put two stacks of seven on the roof.Theyll stick out over the edges, but as long as theyre secure, Im happy.Every day, after driving, Ill spread them out then wait all day.Man itll be dull.Well its a start.Tomorrows mission: transfer Rover 1s battery to Rover 2.LOG ENTRY: SOL 64  Sometimes things are easy, and sometimes theyre not.Getting the battery out of Rover 1 was easy.I removed two clamps on the undercarriage and it dropped right out.The cabling was easy to detach, too, just a couple of complicated plugs.Attaching it to Rover 2, however, is another story.Theres nowhere to put it!The thing is huge.I was barely able to drag it.And thats in Mars gravity.Its just too big.Theres no room in the undercarriage for a second one.Theres no room on the roof, either.Thats where the solar cells will go.Theres no room inside the cabin, and it wouldnt fit through the airlock anyway.But fear not, I found a solution.For emergencies completely unrelated to this one, NASA provided six square meters of extra Hab canvas and some really impressive resin.The same kind of resin, in fact, that saved my life on Sol 6 (the patch kit I used on the hole in my suit).In the event of a Hab breach, everyone would run to the airlocks.Procedure was to let the Hab pop rather than die trying to prevent it.Then, wed suit up and assess the damage.Once we found the breach, wed seal it with the spare canvas and resin.Then reinflate and were good as new.The six square meters of spare canvas was a convenient one by six meters.I cut 10 centimeter wide strips, then used them to make a sort of harness.I used the resin and straps to make two 10 meter circumference loops.Then I put a big patch of canvas on each end.I now had poor mans saddlebags for my rover.This is getting more and more Wagon Train every day.The resin sets almost instantly.But it gets stronger if you wait an hour.So I did.Then I suited up and headed out to the rover.I dragged the battery to the side of the rover and looped one end of the harness around it.Then I threw the other end over the roof.On the other side, I filled it with rocks.When the two weights were roughly equal, I was able to pull the rocks down and bring the battery up.Yay!I unplugged Rover 2s battery and plugged in Rover 1s.Then I went through the airlock to the rover and checked all systems.Everything was a okay.I drove the rover around a bit to make sure the harness was secure.I found a few largish rocks to drive over, just to shake things up.The harness held.Hell yeah.For a short time, I wondered how to splice the second batterys leads into the main power supply.My conclusion was Fuck it.Theres no need to have a continuous power supply.When Battery 1 runs out, I can get out, unplug Battery 1, and plug in Battery 2.Why not?Its a ten minute EVA, once per day.Id have to swap batteries again when Im recharging them, but again, so what?I spent the rest of the day sweeping off the solar cell farm.Soon, I shall be looting it.LOG ENTRY: SOL 65  The solar cells were a lot easier to manage than the battery.Theyre thin, light, and just lying around on the ground.And I had one additional bonus: I was the one who set them up in the first place.Well, okay.It wasnt just me.Vogel and I worked together on it.And boy did we drill on it.We spent almost an entire week drilling on the solar array alone.Then we drilled more whenever they figured we had spare time.The array was mission critical.If we broke the cells or rendered them useless, the Hab wouldnt be able to make power, and the mission would end.You might wonder what the rest of the crew was doing while we assembled the array.They were setting up the Hab.Remember, everything in my glorious kingdom came here in boxes.We had to set it up on Sols 1 and 2.Each solar cell is on a lightweight lattice that holds it at a 14 degree angle.Ill admit I dont know why its a 14 degree angle.Something about maximizing solar energy.Anyway, removing the cells was simple, and the Hab can spare them.With the reduced load of only supporting one human instead of six, a 14 percent energy production loss is irrelevant.Then it was time to stack them on the rover.I considered removing the rock sample container.Its nothing more than a large canvas bag attached to the roof.Way too small to hold the solar cells.But after some thought I left it there, figuring it would provide a good cushion.The cells stacked well (they were made to, for transport to Mars), and the two stacks sat nicely on the roof.They hung over the left and right edges, but I wont be going through any tunnels, so I dont care.With some more abuse of the emergency Hab material, I made straps and tied the cells down.The rover has external handles near the front and back.Theyre there to help us load rocks on the roof.They made perfect anchor points for the straps.I stood back and admired my work.Hey, I earned it.It wasnt even noon and I was done.I came back to the Hab, had some lunch, and worked on my crops for the rest of the sol.Its been thirty nine sols since I planted the potatoes (which is about forty Earth days), and it was time to reap and resow.They grew even better than I had expected.Mars has no insects, parasites, or blights to deal with, and the Hab maintains perfect growing temperature and moisture at all times.They were small compared to the taters youd usually eat, but thats fine.All I wanted was enough to support growing new plants.I dug them up, being careful to leave their plants alive.Then I cut them up into small pieces with one eye each and reseeded them into new dirt.If they keep growing this well, Ill be able to last a good long time here.After all that physical labor, I deserved a break.I rifled through Johanssens computer today and found an endless supply of digital books.Looks like shes a big fan of Agatha Christie.The Beatles, Christie I guess shes an Anglophile or something.I remember liking Hercule Poirot TV specials back when I was a kid.Ill start with The Mysterious Affair at Styles.Looks like thats the first one.LOG ENTRY: SOL 66  The time has come (ominous musical crescendo) for some missions!NASA gets to name their missions after gods and stuff, so why cant I?Henceforth, rover experimental missions will be Sirius missions.Get it?Dogs?Well if you dont, fuck you.Sirius 1 will be tomorrow.The mission: Start with fully charged batteries and solar cells on the roof, drive until I run out of power, and see how far I get.I wont be an idiot.Im not driving directly away from the Hab.Ill drive a half kilometer stretch, back and forth.Ill be within a short walk of home at all times.Tonight, Ill charge up both batteries so I can be ready for a little test drive tomorrow.I estimate three and a half hours of driving, so Ill need to bring fresh CO2 filters.And, with the heater off, Ill wear three layers of clothes.LOG ENTRY: SOL 67  Sirius 1 is complete!More accurately, Sirius 1 was aborted after one hour.I guess you could call it a failure, but I prefer the term learning experience.Things started out fine.I drove to a nice flat spot a kilometer from the Hab, then started going back and forth over a 500 meter stretch.I quickly realized this would be a crappy test.After a few laps, I had compressed the soil enough to have a solid path.Nice, hard ground, which makes for abnormally high energy efficiency.Nothing like it would be on a long trip.So I shook it up a bit.I drove around randomly, making sure to stay within a kilometer of the Hab.A much more realistic test.After an hour, things started to get cold.And I mean really cold.The rovers always cold when you first get in it.When you havent disabled the heater, it warms up right away.I expected it to be cold, but Jesus Christ!I was fine for a while.My own body heat plus three layers of clothing kept me warm, and the rovers insulation is top notch.The heat that escaped my body just warmed up the interior.But theres no such thing as perfect insulation, and eventually the heat left to the great outdoors, while I got colder and colder.Within an hour, I was chattering and numb.Enough was enough.Theres no way I could do a long trip like this.Turning the heater on, I drove straight back to the Hab.Once I got home, I sulked for a while.All my brilliant plans foiled by thermodynamics.Damn you, Entropy!Im in a bind.The damn heater will eat half my battery power every day.I could turn it down, I guess.Be a little cold but not freezing to death.Even then Id still lose at least a quarter.This will require some thought.I have to ask myself What would Hercule Poirot do?Ill have to put my little gray cells to work on the problem.LOG ENTRY: SOL 68  Well, shit.I came up with a solution, but remember when I burned rocket fuel in the Hab?Thisll be more dangerous.Im going to use the RTG.The RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator) is a big box of plutonium.But not the kind used in nuclear bombs.No, no.This plutonium is way more dangerous!Plutonium 238 is an incredibly unstable isotope.Its so radioactive that it will get red hot all by itself.As you can imagine, a material that can literally fry an egg with radiation is kind of dangerous.The RTG houses the plutonium, catches the radiation in the form of heat, and turns it into electricity.Its not a reactor.The radiation cant be increased or decreased.Its a purely natural process happening at the atomic level.As long ago as the 1960s, NASA began using RTGs to power unmanned probes.They have lots of advantages over solar power.Theyre not affected by storms; they work day or night; theyre entirely internal, so you dont need delicate solar cells all over your probe.But they never used large RTGs on manned missions until the Ares Program.Why not?It should be pretty damned obvious why not!They didnt want to put astronauts next to a glowing hot ball of radioactive death!Im exaggerating a little.The plutonium is inside a bunch of pellets, each one sealed and insulated to prevent radiation leakage, even if the outer container is breached.So for the Ares Program, they took the risk.An Ares mission is all about the MAV.Its the single most important component.Its one of the few systems that cant be replaced or worked around.Its the only component that causes a complete mission scrub if its not working.Solar cells are great in the short term, and theyre good for the long term if you have humans around to clean them.But the MAV sits alone for years quietly making fuel, then just kind of hangs out until its crew arrives.Even doing nothing, it needs power, so NASA can monitor it remotely and run self checks.The prospect of scrubbing a mission because a solar cell got dirty was unacceptable.They needed a more reliable source of power.So the MAV comes equipped with an RTG.It has 2.6 kilograms of plutonium 238, which makes almost 1500 watts of heat.It can turn that into 100 watts of electricity.The MAV runs on that until the crew arrive.One hundred watts isnt enough to keep the heater going, but I dont care about the electrical output.I want the heat.A 1500 watt heater is so warm Ill have to tear insulation out of the rover to keep it from getting too hot.As soon as the rovers were unstowed and activated, Commander Lewis had the joy of disposing of the RTG.She detached it from the MAV, drove four kilometers away, and buried it.However safe it may be, its still a radioactive core and NASA didnt want it too close to their astronauts.The mission parameters dont give a specific location to dump the RTG.Just at least four kilometers away.So Ill have to find it.I have two things working for me.First, I was assembling solar panels with Vogel when Commander Lewis drove off, and I saw she headed due south.Also, she planted a three meter pole with a bright green flag over where she buried it.Green shows up extremely well against the Martian terrain.Its made to ward us off, in case we get lost on a rover EVA later on.So my plan is: Head south four kilometers, then search around till I see the green flag.Having rendered Rover 1 unusable, Ill have to use my mutant rover for the trip.I can make a useful test mission of it.Ill see how well the battery harness holds up to a real journey, and how well the solar cells do strapped to the roof.Ill call it Sirius 2.LOG ENTRY: SOL 69  Im no stranger to Mars.Ive been here a long time.But Ive never been out of sight of the Hab before today.You wouldnt think that would make a difference, but it does.As I made my way toward the RTGs burial site, it hit me: Mars is a barren wasteland and I am completely alone here.I already knew that, of course.But theres a difference between knowing it and really experiencing it.All around me there was nothing but dust, rocks, and endless empty desert in all directions.The planets famous red color is from iron oxide coating everything.So its not just a desert.Its a desert so old its literally rusting.The Hab is my only hint of civilization, and seeing it disappear made me way more uncomfortable than I like to admit.I put those thoughts behind me by concentrating on what was in front of me.I found the RTG right where it was supposed to be, four kilometers due south of the Hab.It wasnt hard to find.Commander Lewis had buried it atop a small hill.She probably wanted to make sure everyone could see the flag, and it worked great!Except instead of avoiding it, I beelined to it and dug it up.Not exactly what she was going for.It was a large cylinder with heat sinks all around it.I could feel the warmth it gave off even through my suits gloves.Thats really disconcerting.Especially when you know the root cause of the heat is radiation.No point in putting it on the roof; my plan was to have it in the cabin anyway.So I brought it in with me, turned off the heater, then drove back to the Hab.In the ten minutes it took to get home, even with the heater off, the interior of the rover became an uncomfortably hot 37C.The RTG would definitely be able to keep me warm.The trip also proved that my rigging worked.The solar cells and extra battery stayed beautifully in place while traversing eight kilometers of random terrain.I declare Sirius 2 to be a successful mission!I spent the rest of the day vandalizing the interior of the rover.The pressure compartment is made of carbon composite.Just inside that is insulation, which is covered by hard plastic.I used a sophisticated method to remove sections of plastic (hammer), then carefully removed the solid foam insulation (hammer again).After tearing out some insulation, I suited up and took the RTG outside.Soon, the rover cooled down again, and I brought it back in.I watched as the temperature rose slowly.Nowhere near as fast as it had on my trip back from the burial site.I cautiously removed more insulation (hammer) and checked again.After a few more cycles of this, I had enough insulation torn out that the RTG could barely keep up with it.In fact, it was a losing battle.Over time, heat will slowly leach out.Thats fine.I can turn on the heater for short bursts when necessary.I brought the insulation pieces with me back into the Hab.Using advanced construction techniques (duct tape), I reassembled some of them into a square.I figure if things ever get really cold, I can tape that to a bare patch in the rover, and the RTG will be winning the heat fight.Tomorrow, Sirius 3 (which is just Sirius 1 again, but without freezing).LOG ENTRY: SOL 70  Today, I write to you from the rover.Im halfway through Sirius 3 and things are going well.I set out at first light and drove laps around the Hab, trying to stay on untouched ground.The first battery lasted just under two hours.After a quick EVA to switch the cables, I got back to driving.When all was said and done, I had driven 81 kilometers in 3 hours and 27 minutes.Thats very good!Mind you, the land around the Hab is really flat, as is all of Acidalia Planitia.I have no idea what my efficiency would be on the nastier land en route to Ares 4.The second battery still had a little juice left, but I cant just run it down all the way before I stop; remember, I need life support while recharging.The CO2 gets absorbed through a chemical process, but if the fan that pushes it isnt working, Ill choke.The oxygen pump is also kind of important.After my drive, I set up the solar cells.It was hard work; last time I had Vogels help.They arent heavy, but theyre awkward.After setting up half of them, I figured out I could drag them rather than carry them, and that sped things up.Now Im just waiting for the batteries to recharge.Im bored, so Im updating the log.I have all the Poirot books in my computer.Thatll help.Its going to take twelve hours to recharge, after all.Whats that, you say?Twelve hours is wrong?I said thirteen hours earlier?Well, my friend, let me set you straight.The RTG is a generator.Its a paltry amount of power, compared to what the rover consumes, but its not nothing.Its one hundred watts.Itll cut an hour off my total recharge time.Why not use it?I wonder what NASA would think about me fucking with the RTG like this.Theyd probably hide under their desks and cuddle with their slide rules for comfort.LOG ENTRY: SOL 71  As predicted, it took twelve hours to charge the batteries to full.I came straight home as soon as they were done.Time to make plans for Sirius 4.And I think itll be a multiday field trip.Looks like power and battery recharging are solved.Foods not a problem; theres plenty of space to store things.Waters even easier than food.I need two liters per day to be comfortable.When I do my trip to Ares 4 for real, Ill need to bring the oxygenator.But its big and I dont want to screw with it right now.So Ill rely on O2 and CO2 filters for Sirius 4.CO2 isnt a problem.I started this grand adventure with 1500 hours of CO2 filters, plus another 720 for emergency use.All systems use standard filters (Apollo 13 taught us important lessons).Since then, Ive used 131 hours of filter on various EVAs.I have 2089 left.Eighty seven days worth.Plenty.
