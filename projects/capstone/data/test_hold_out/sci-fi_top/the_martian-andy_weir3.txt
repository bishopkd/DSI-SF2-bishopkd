Oxygens a little trickier.The rover was designed to support three people for two days, plus some reserve for safety.So its O2 tanks can hold enough to last me seven days.Not enough.Mars has almost no atmospheric pressure.The inside of the rover has one atmosphere.So the oxygen tanks are on the inside (less pressure differential to deal with).Why does that matter?It means I can bring along other oxygen tanks, and equalize them with the rovers tanks without having to do an EVA.So today, I detached one of the Habs two 25 liter liquid oxygen tanks and brought it into the rover.According to NASA, a human needs 588 liters of oxygen per day to live.Compressed liquid O2 is about 1000 times as dense as gaseous O2 in a comfortable atmosphere.Long story short: With the Hab tank, I have enough O2 to last 49 days.Thatll be plenty.Sirius 4 will be a twenty day trip.That may seem a bit long, but I have a specific goal in mind.Besides, my trip to Ares 4 will be at least forty days.This is a good scale model.While Im away, the Hab can take care of itself, but the potatoes are an issue.Ill saturate the ground with most of the water I have.Then, Ill deactivate the atmospheric regulator, so it doesnt pull water out of the air.Itll be humid as hell, and water will condense on every surface.Thatll keep the potatoes well watered while Im away.A bigger problem is CO2.The potatoes need to breathe.I know what youre thinking.Mark, old chap!You produce carbon dioxide!Its all part of the majestic circle of nature!The problem is: Where will I put it?Sure, I exhale CO2 with every breath, but I dont have any way to store it.I could turn off the oxygenator and atmospheric regulator and just fill the Hab with my breath over time.But CO2 is deadly to me.I need to release a bunch at once and run away.Remember the MAV fuel plant?It collects CO2 from the Martian atmosphere.A 10 liter tank of compressed liquid CO2, vented into the Hab, will be enough CO2 to do the trick.Thatll take less than a day to create.So thats everything.Once I vent the CO2 into the Hab, Ill turn off the atmospheric regulator and oxygenator, dump a ton of water on the crops, and head out.Sirius 4.A huge step forward in my rover research.And I can start tomorrow.Chapter 8   Hello, and thank you for joining us, Cathy Warner said to the camera.Today on CNNs Mark Watney Report: Several EVAs over the past few days what do they mean?What progress has NASA made on a rescue option?And how will this affect the Ares 4 preparations?Joining us today is Dr.Venkat Kapoor, director of Mars operations for NASA.Dr.Kapoor, thank you for coming.A pleasure to be here, Cathy, Venkat said.Dr.Kapoor, Cathy said, Mark Watney is the most watched man in the solar system, wouldnt you say?Venkat nodded.Certainly the most watched by NASA.We have all twelve of our Martian satellites taking pictures whenever his sites in view.The European Space Agency has both of theirs doing the same.All told, how often do you get these images?Every few minutes.Sometimes theres a gap, based on the satellite orbits.But its enough that we can track all his EVA activities.Tell us about these latest EVAs.Well, Venkat said, it looks like hes preparing Rover 2 for a long trip.On Sol 64, he took the battery from the other rover and attached it with a homemade sling.The next day, he detached fourteen solar cells and stacked them on the rovers roof.And then he took a little drive, didnt he?Cathy prompted.Yes he did.Sort of aimlessly for an hour, then back to the Hab.He was probably testing it.Next time we saw him was two days later, when he drove four kilometers away, then back.Another incremental test, we think.Then, over the past couple of days, hes been stocking it up with supplies.Hmm, Cathy said, most analysts think Marks only hope of rescue is to get to the Ares 4 site.Do you think hes come to the same conclusion?Probably, Venkat said.He doesnt know were watching.From his point of view, Ares 4 is his only hope.Do you think hes planning to go soon?He seems to be getting ready for a trip.I hope not, Venkat said.Theres nothing at the site other than the MAV.None of the other presupplies.It would be a very long, very dangerous trip, and hed be leaving the safety of the Hab behind.Why would he risk it?Communication, Venkat said.Once he reaches the MAV, he could contact us.So that would be a good thing, wouldnt it?Communication would be a great thing.But traversing thirty two hundred kilometers to Ares 4 is incredibly dangerous.Wed rather he stayed put.If we could talk to him, wed certainly tell him that.He cant stay put forever, right?Eventually hell need to get to the MAV.Not necessarily, Venkat said.JPL is experimenting with modifications to the MDV so it can make a brief overland flight after landing.Id heard that idea was rejected as being too dangerous, Cathy said.Their first proposal was, yes.Since then, theyve been working on safer ways to do it.With only three and a half years before Ares 4s scheduled launch, is there enough time to make and test modifications to the MDV?I cant answer that for sure.But remember, we made a lunar lander from scratch in seven years.Excellent point.Cathy smiled.So what are his odds right now?No idea, Venkat said.But were going to do everything we can to bring him home alive.*  Mindy glanced nervously around the conference room.Shed never felt so thoroughly outranked in her life.Dr.Venkat Kapoor, who was four levels of management above her, sat to her left.Next to him was Bruce Ng, the director of JPL.Hed flown all the way to Houston from Pasadena just for this meeting.Never one to let precious time go to waste, he typed furiously on his laptop.The dark bags under his eyes made Mindy wonder just how overworked he truly was.Mitch Henderson, the flight director for Ares 3, swiveled back and forth in his chair, a wireless earpiece in his ear.It fed him a real time stream of all the comm chatter from Mission Control.He wasnt on shift, but he was kept apprised at all times.Annie Montrose entered the conference room, texting as she walked.Never taking her eyes off her phone, she deftly navigated around the edge of the room, avoiding people and chairs, and sat in her usual spot.Mindy felt a pang of envy as she watched the director of media relations.She was everything Mindy wanted to be.Confident, high ranking, beautiful, and universally respected within NASA.Howd I do today?Venkat asked.Eeeh, Annie said, putting her phone away.You shouldnt say things like bring him home alive.It reminds people he might die.Think theyre going to forget that?You asked my opinion.Dont like it?Go fuck yourself.Youre such a delicate flower, Annie.Howd you end up NASAs director of media relations?Beats the fuck out of me, Annie said.Guys, Bruce said, I need to catch a flight back to LA in three hours.Is Teddy coming or what?Quit bitching, Bruce, Annie said.None of us want to be here.Mitch turned the volume down on his earpiece and faced Mindy.Who are you, again?Um, Mindy said, Im Mindy Park.I work in SatCon.You a director or something?No, I just work in SatCon.Im a nobody.Venkat looked to Mitch.I put her in charge of tracking Watney.She gets us the imagery.Huh, said Mitch.Not the director of SatCon?Bobs got more to deal with than just Mars.Mindys handling all the Martian satellites, and keeps them pointed at Mark.Why Mindy?Mitch asked.She noticed he was alive in the first place.She gets a promotion cause she was in the hot seat when the imagery came through?No, Venkat frowned, she gets a promotion cause she figured out he was alive.Stop being a jerk, Mitch.Youre making her feel bad.Mitch raised his eyebrows.Didnt think of that.Sorry, Mindy.Mindy looked at the table and managed to say, kay.Teddy entered the room.Sorry Im late.He took his seat and pulled several folders from his briefcase.Stacking them neatly, he opened the top one and squared the pages within.Lets get started.Venkat, whats Watneys status?Alive and well, Venkat said.No change from my e mail earlier today.What about the RTG?Does the public know about that yet?Teddy asked.Annie leaned forward.So far, so good, she said.The images are public, but we have no obligation to tell them our analysis.Nobody has figured it out yet.Why did he dig it up?Heat, I think, Venkat said.He wants to make the rover do long trips.It uses a lot of energy keeping warm.The RTG can heat up the interior without soaking battery power.Its a good idea, really.How dangerous is it?Teddy asked.As long as the containers intact, no danger at all.Even if it cracks open, hell be okay if the pellets inside dont break.But if the pellets break, too, hes a dead man.Lets hope that doesnt happen, Teddy said.JPL, how are the MDV plans coming along?We came up with a plan a long time ago, Bruce said.You rejected it.Bruce, Teddy cautioned.Bruce sighed.The MDV wasnt made for liftoff and lateral flight.Packing more fuel in doesnt help.Wed need a bigger engine and dont have time to invent one.So we need to lighten the MDV.We have an idea for that.The MDV can be its normal weight on primary descent.If we made the heat shield and outer hull detachable, they could ditch a lot of weight after landing at Ares 3, and have a lighter ship for the traverse to Ares 4.Were running the numbers now.Keep me posted, Teddy said.He turned to Mindy.Miss Park, welcome to the big leagues.Sir, Mindy said.She tried to ignore the lump in her throat.Whats the biggest gap in coverage we have on Watney right now?Um, Mindy said.Once every forty one hours, well have a seventeen minute gap.The orbits work out that way.You had an immediate answer, Teddy said.Good.I like it when people are organized.Thank you, sir.I want that gap down to four minutes, Teddy said.Im giving you total authority over satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments.Make it happen.Yes, sir, Mindy said, with no idea how to do it.Teddy looked to Mitch.Mitch, your e mail said you had something urgent?Yeah, Mitch said.How long are we gonna keep this from the Ares 3 crew?They all think Watneys dead.Its a huge drain on morale.Teddy looked to Venkat.Mitch, Venkat said.We discussed this  No, you discussed it, Mitch interrupted.They think they lost a crewmate.Theyre devastated.And when they find out they abandoned a crewmate?Venkat asked.Will they feel better then?Mitch poked the table with his finger.They deserve to know.You think Commander Lewis cant handle the truth?Its a matter of morale, Venkat said.They can concentrate on getting home  I make that call, Mitch said.Im the one who decides whats best for the crew.And I say we bring them up to speed.After a few moments of silence, all eyes turned to Teddy.He thought for a moment.Sorry, Mitch, Im with Venkat on this one, he said.But as soon as we come up with a plan for rescue, we can tell Hermes.There needs to be some hope, or theres no point in telling them.Bullshit, Mitch grumbled, crossing his arms.Total bullshit.I know youre upset, Teddy said calmly, Well make it right.Just as soon as we have some idea how to save Watney.Teddy let a few seconds of quiet pass before moving on.Okay, JPLs on the rescue option, he said with a nod toward Bruce.But it would be part of Ares 4.How does he stay alive till then?Venkat?Venkat opened a folder and glanced at the paperwork inside.I had every team check and double check the longevity of their systems.Were pretty sure the Hab can keep working for four years.Especially with a human occupant fixing problems as they arise.But theres no way around the food issue.Hell start starving in a year.We have to send him supplies.Simple as that.What about an Ares 4 presupply?said Teddy.Land it at Ares 3 instead.Thats what were thinking, yeah, Venkat confirmed.Problem is, the original plan was to launch presupplies a year from now.Theyre not ready yet.It takes eight months to get a probe to Mars in the best of times.The positions of Earth and Mars right now its not the best of times.We figure we can get there in nine months.Presuming hes rationing his food, hes got enough to last three hundred and fifty more days.That means we need to build a presupply in three months.JPL hasnt even started yet.Thatll be tight, Bruce said.Making a presupply is a six month process.Were set up to pipeline a bunch of them at once, not to make one in a hurry.Sorry, Bruce, Teddy said.I know were asking a lot, but you have to find a way.Well find a way, Bruce said.But the OT alone will be a nightmare.Get started.Ill find you the money.Theres also the booster, Venkat said.The only way to get a probe to Mars with the planets in their current positions is to spend a butt load of fuel.We only have one booster capable of doing that.The Delta IX thats on the pad right now for the EagleEye 3 Saturn probe.Well have to steal that.I talked to ULA, and they just cant make another booster in time.The EagleEye 3 team will be pissed, but okay, said Teddy.We can delay their mission if JPL gets the payload done in time.Bruce rubbed his eyes.Well do our best.Hell starve to death if you dont, Teddy said.*  Venkat sipped his coffee and frowned at his computer.A month ago it would have been unthinkable to drink coffee at nine p. m.  Now it was necessary fuel.Shift schedules, fund allocations, project juggling, out and out looting of other projects hed never pulled so many stunts in his life.NASAs a large organization, he typed.It doesnt deal with sudden change well.The only reason were getting away with it is the desperate circumstances.Everyones pulling together to save Mark Watney, with no interdepartmental squabbling.I cant tell you how rare that is.Even then, this is going to cost tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars.The MDV modifications alone are an entire project thats being staffed up.Hopefully, the public interest will make your job easier.We appreciate your continued support, Congressman, and hope you can sway the committee toward granting us the emergency funding we need.He was interrupted by a knock at his door.Looking up, he saw Mindy.She wore sweats and a T shirt, her hair in a sloppy ponytail.Fashion tended to suffer when work hours ran long.Sorry to bother you, Mindy said.No bother, Venkat said.I could use a break.Whats up?Hes on the move, she said.Venkat slouched in his chair.Any chance its a test drive?She shook her head.He drove straightaway from the Hab for almost two hours, did a short EVA, then drove for another two.We think the EVA was to change batteries.Venkat sighed heavily.Maybe its just a longer test?An overnight trip kind of thing?Hes seventy six kilometers from the Hab, Mindy said.For an overnight test, wouldnt he stay within walking distance?Yes, he would, Venkat said.Damn it.Weve had teams run every conceivable scenario.Theres just no way he can make it to Ares 4 with that setup.We never saw him load up the oxygenator or water reclaimer.He cant possibly have enough basics to live long enough.I dont think hes going to Ares 4, Mindy said.If he is, hes taking a weird path.Oh?said Venkat.He went south southwest.Schiaparelli crater is southeast.Okay, maybe theres hope, Venkat said.Whats he doing right now?Recharging.Hes got all the solar cells set up, Mindy said.Last time he did that, it took twelve hours.I was going to sneak home for some sleep if thats okay.Sure, sounds good.Well see what he does tomorrow.Maybe hell go back to the Hab.Maybe, Mindy said, unconvinced.*  Welcome back, Cathy said to the camera.Were chatting with Marcus Washington, from the US Postal Service.So, Mr.Washington, I understand the Ares 3 mission caused a postal service first.Can you explain that to our viewers?Uh yeah, said Marcus.Everyone thought Mark Watney was dead for over two months.In that time, the postal service issued a run of commemorative stamps honoring his memory.Twenty thousand were printed and sent to post offices around the country.And then it turned out he was alive, Cathy said.Yeah, said Marcus.We dont print stamps of living people.So we stopped the run immediately and recalled the stamps, but thousands were already sold.Has this ever happened before?Cathy asked.No.Not once in the history of the postal service.I bet theyre worth a pretty penny now.Marcus chuckled.Maybe.But like I said, thousands were sold.Theyll be rare, but not super rare.Cathy chuckled then addressed the camera.Weve been speaking with Marcus Washington of the United States Postal Service.If youve got a Mark Watney commemorative stamp, you might want to hold on to it.Thanks for dropping by, Mr.Washington.Thanks for having me, Marcus said.Our next guest is Dr.Irene Shields, flight psychologist for the Ares missions.Dr.Shields, welcome to the program.Thank you, Irene said, adjusting her microphone clip.Do you know Mark Watney personally?Of course, Irene said.I did monthly psych evaluations on each member of the crew.What can you tell us about him?His personality, his mind set?Well, Irene said, hes very intelligent.All of them are, of course.But hes particularly resourceful and a good problem solver.That may save his life, Cathy interjected.It may indeed, Irene agreed.Also, hes a good natured man.Usually cheerful, with a great sense of humor.Hes quick with a joke.In the months leading up to launch, the crew was put through a grueling training schedule.They all showed signs of stress and moodiness.Mark was no exception, but the way he showed it was to crack more jokes and get everyone laughing.He sounds like a great guy, Cathy said.He really is, Irene said.He was chosen for the mission in part because of his personality.An Ares crew has to spend thirteen months together.Social compatibility is key.Mark not only fits well in any social group, hes a catalyst to make the group work better.It was a terrible blow to the crew when he died.And they still think hes dead, right?The Ares 3 crew?Yes, they do, unfortunately, Irene confirmed.The higher ups decided to keep it from them, at least for now.Im sure it wasnt an easy decision.Cathy paused for a moment, then said, All right.You know I have to ask: Whats going through his head right now?How does a man like Mark Watney respond to a situation like this?Stranded, alone, no idea were trying to help?Theres no way to be sure, Irene said.The biggest threat is giving up hope.If he decides theres no chance to survive, hell stop trying.Then were okay for now, right?Cathy said.He seems to be working hard.Hes prepping the rover for a long trip and testing it.He plans to be there when Ares 4 lands.Thats one interpretation, yes, Irene said.Is there another?Irene carefully formed her answer before speaking.When facing death, people want to be heard.They dont want to die alone.He might just want the MAV radio so he can talk to another soul before he dies.If hes lost hope, he wont care about survival.His only concern will be making it to the radio.After that, hell probably take an easier way out than starvation.The medical supplies of an Ares mission have enough morphine to be lethal.After several seconds of complete silence in the studio, Cathy turned to the camera.Well be right back.*  Heya, Venk.Bruces voice came from the speakerphone on Venkats desk.Bruce, hi, said Venkat, typing on his computer.Thanks for clearing up some time.I wanted to talk about the presupply.Sure thing.Whats on your mind?Lets say we soft land it perfectly.How will Mark know it happened?And how will he know where to look?Weve been thinking about that, said Bruce.Weve got some ideas.Im all ears, Venkat said, saving his document and closing his laptop.Well be sending him a comm system anyway, right?We could have it turn on after landing.Itll broadcast on the rover and EVA suit frequencies.Itll have to be a strong signal, too.The rovers were only designed to communicate with the Hab and each other; the signal origin was presumed to be within twenty kilometers.The receivers just arent very sensitive.The EVA suits are even worse.But as long as we have a strong signal we should be good.Once we land the presupply, well get its exact location from satellites, then broadcast that to Mark so he can go get it.But hes probably not listening, said Venkat.Why would he be?We have a plan for that.Were going to make a bunch of bright green ribbons.Light enough to flutter around when dropped, even in Marss atmosphere.Each ribbon will have MARK: TURN ON YOUR COMM printed on it.Were working on a release mechanism now.During the landing sequence, of course.Ideally, about a thousand meters above the surface.I like it, Venkat said.All he needs to do is notice one.And hes sure to check out a bright green ribbon if he sees one outside.Venk, said Bruce.If he takes the Watneymobile to Ares 4, thisll all be for nothing.I mean, we can land it at Ares 4 if that happens, but  But hell be without a Hab.Yeah, Venkat said.One thing at a time.Let me know when you come up with a release mechanism for those ribbons.Will do.After terminating the call, Venkat opened his laptop to get back to work.There was an e mail from Mindy Park waiting for him.Watneys on the move again.*  Still going in a straight line, Mindy said, pointing to her monitor.I see, Venkat said.Hes sure as hell not going to Ares 4.Unless hes going around some natural obstacle.Theres nothing for him to go around, Mindy said.Its Acidalia Planitia.Are those the solar cells?Venkat asked, pointing to the screen.Yeah, Mindy said.He did the usual two hour drive, EVA, two hour drive.Hes one hundred and fifty six kilometers from the Hab now.They both peered at the screen.Wait Venkat said.Wait, no way  What?Mindy asked.Venkat grabbed a pad of Post its and a pen.Give me his location, and the location of the Hab.Mindy checked her screen.Hes currently at 28.9 degrees north, 29.6 degrees west.With a few keystrokes, she brought up another file.The Habs at 31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.What do you see?Venkat finished taking down the numbers.Come with me, he said, quickly walking out.Um, Mindy stammered, following after.Where are we going?SatCon break room, Venkat said.You guys still have that map of Mars on the wall?Sure, Mindy said.But its just a poster from the gift shop.Ive got high quality digital maps on my computer  Nope.I cant draw on those, he said.Then, rounding the corner to the break room, he pointed to the Mars map on the wall.I can draw on that.The break room was empty save for a computer technician sipping a cup of coffee.He looked up in alarm as Venkat and Mindy stormed in.Good, it has latitude and longitude lines, Venkat said.Looking at his Post it, then sliding his finger along the map, he drew an X.  Thats the Hab, he said.Hey, the technician said.Are you drawing on our poster?Ill buy you a new one, Venkat said without looking back.Then, he drew another X.  Thats his current location.Get me a ruler.Mindy looked left and right.Seeing no ruler, she grabbed the technicians notebook.Hey!the technician protested.Using the notebook as a straight edge, Venkat drew a line from the Hab to Marks location and beyond.Then took a step back.Yup!Thats where hes going!Venkat said excitedly.Oh!Mindy said.The line passed through the exact center of a bright yellow dot printed on the map.Pathfinder!Mindy said.Hes going to Pathfinder!Yup!Venkat said.Now were getting somewhere.Its like eight hundred kilometers from him.He can get there and back with supplies on hand.And bring Pathfinder and Sojourner rover back with him, Mindy added.Venkat pulled out his cell phone.We lost contact with Pathfinder in 1997.If he can get it online again, we can communicate.It might just need the solar cells cleaned.Even if its got a bigger problem, hes an engineer!Dialing, he added, Fixing things is his job!Smiling for what felt like the first time in weeks, he held the phone to his ear and awaited a response.Bruce?Its Venkat.Everything just changed.Watneys headed for Pathfinder.Yeah!I know, right!?Dig up everyone who was on that project and get them to JPL now.Ill catch the next flight.Hanging up, he grinned at the map.Mark, you sneaky, clever, son of a bitch!Chapter 9      LOG ENTRY: SOL 79  Its the evening of my eighth day on the road.Sirius 4 has been a success so far.Ive fallen into a routine.Every morning I wake up at dawn.First thing I do is check oxygen and CO2 levels.Then I eat a breakfast pack and drink a cup of water.After that, I brush my teeth, using as little water as possible, and shave with an electric razor.The rover has no toilet.We were expected to use our suits reclamation systems for that.But they arent designed to hold twenty days worth of output.My morning piss goes in a resealable plastic box.When I open it, the rover reeks like a truck stop mens room.I could take it outside and let it boil off.But I worked hard to make that water, and the last thing Im going to do is waste it.Ill feed it to the water reclaimer when I get back.Even more precious is my manure.Its critical to the potato farm, and Im the only source on Mars.Fortunately, when you spend a lot of time in space, you learn how to shit in a bag.And if you think things are bad after opening the piss box, imagine the smell after I drop anchor.After Im done with that lovely routine, I go outside and collect the solar cells.Why didnt I do it the previous night?Because trying to dismantle and stack solar cells in total darkness isnt fun.I learned that the hard way.After securing the cells, I come back in, turn on some shitty seventies music, and start driving.I putter along at 25 kph, the rovers top speed.Its comfortable inside.I wear hastily made cutoffs and a thin shirt while the RTG bakes the interior.When it gets too hot I detach the insulation duct taped to the hull.When it gets too cold, I tape it back up.I can go almost two hours before the first battery runs out.I do a quick EVA to swap cables, then Im back at the wheel for the second half of the days drive.The terrain is very flat.The undercarriage of the rover is taller than any of the rocks around here, and the hills are gently sloping affairs, smoothed by eons of sandstorms.When the other battery runs out, its time for another EVA.I pull the solar cells off the roof and lay them on the ground.For the first few sols, I lined them up in a row.Now I plop them wherever, trying to keep them close to the rover out of sheer laziness.Then comes the incredibly dull part of my day.I sit around for twelve hours with nothing to do.And Im getting sick of this rover.The insides the size of a van.That may seem like plenty of room, but try being trapped in a van for eight days.I look forward to tending my potato farm in the wide open space of the Hab.Im nostalgic for the Hab.How fucked up is that?I have shitty seventies TV to watch, and a bunch of Poirot novels to read.But mostly I spend my time thinking about getting to Ares 4.Ill have to do it someday.How the hell am I going to survive a 3200 kilometer trip in this thing?Itll probably take fifty days.Ill need the water reclaimer and the oxygenator, maybe some of the Habs main batteries, then a bunch more solar cells to charge everything Where will I put it all?These thoughts pester me throughout the long, boring days.Eventually, it gets dark and I get tired.I lie among the food packs, water tanks, extra O2 tank, piles of CO2 filters, box of pee, bags of shit, and personal items.I have a bunch of crew jumpsuits to serve as bedding, along with my blanket and pillow.Basically, I sleep in a pile of junk every night.Speaking of sleep Gnight.LOG ENTRY: SOL 80  By my reckoning, Im about 100 kilometers from Pathfinder.Technically its Carl Sagan Memorial Station.But with all due respect to Carl, I can call it whatever the hell I want.Im the King of Mars.As I mentioned, its been a long, boring drive.And Im still on the outward leg.But hey, Im an astronaut.Long ass trips are my business.Navigation is tricky.The Habs nav beacon only reaches 40 kilometers, so its useless to me out here.I knew thatd be an issue when I was planning this little road trip, so I came up with a brilliant plan that didnt work.The computer has detailed maps, so I figured I could navigate by landmarks.I was wrong.Turns out you cant navigate by landmarks if you cant find any god damned landmarks.Our landing site is at the delta of a long gone river.NASA chose it because if there are any microscopic fossils to be had, its a good place to look.Also, the water would have dragged rock and soil samples from thousands of kilometers away.With some digging, we could get a broad geological history.Thats great for science, but it means the Habs in a featureless wasteland.I considered making a compass.The rover has plenty of electricity, and the med kit has a needle.Only one problem: Mars doesnt have a magnetic field.So I navigate by Phobos.It whips around Mars so fast it actually rises and sets twice a day, running west to east.It isnt the most accurate system, but it works.Things got easier on Sol 75.I reached a valley with a rise to the west.It had flat ground for easy driving, and I just needed to follow the edge of the hills.I named it Lewis Valley after our fearless leader.Shed love it there, geology nerd that she is.Three sols later, Lewis Valley opened into a wide plain.So, again, I was left without references and relied on Phobos to guide me.Theres probably symbolism there.Phobos is the god of fear, and Im letting it be my guide.Not a good sign.But today, my luck finally changed.After two sols wandering the desert, I found something to navigate by.It was a five kilometer crater, so small it didnt even have a listed name.But it was on the maps, so to me it was the Lighthouse of Alexandria.Once I had it in sight, I knew exactly where I was.Im camped near it now, as a matter of fact.Im finally through the blank areas of the map.Tomorrow, Ill have the Lighthouse to navigate by, and Hamelin crater later on.Im in good shape.Now on to my next task: sitting around with nothing to do for twelve hours.I better get started!LOG ENTRY: SOL 81  Almost made it to Pathfinder today, but I ran out of juice.Just another 22 kilometers to go!An unremarkable drive.Navigation wasnt a problem.As Lighthouse receded into the distance, the rim of Hamelin crater came into view.I left Acidalia Planitia behind a long time ago.Im well into Ares Vallis now.The desert plains are giving way to bumpier terrain, strewn with ejecta that never got buried by sand.It makes driving a chore; I have to pay more attention.Up till now, Ive been driving right over the rock strewn landscape.But as I travel farther south, the rocks are getting bigger and more plentiful.I have to go around some of them or risk damage to my suspension.The good news is I dont have to do it for long.Once I get to Pathfinder, I can turn around and go the other way.The weathers been very good.No discernible wind, no storms.I think I got lucky there.Theres a good chance my rover tracks from the past few sols are intact.I should be able to get back to Lewis Valley just by following them.After setting up the solar panels today, I went for a little walk.I never left sight of the rover; the last thing I want to do is get lost on foot.But I couldnt stomach crawling back into that cramped, smelly rats nest.Not right away.Its a strange feeling.Everywhere I go, Im the first.Step outside the rover?First guy ever to be there!Climb a hill?First guy to climb that hill!Kick a rock?That rock hadnt moved in a million years!Im the first guy to drive long distance on Mars.The first guy to spend more than thirty one sols on Mars.The first guy to grow crops on Mars.First, first, first!I wasnt expecting to be first at anything.I was the fifth crewman out of the MDV when we landed, making me the seventeenth person to set foot on Mars.The egress order had been determined years earlier.A month before launch, we all got tattoos of our Mars numbers.Johanssen almost refused to get her 15 because she was afraid it would hurt.Heres a woman who had survived the centrifuge, the vomit comet, hard landing drills and 10k runs.A woman who fixed a simulated MDV computer failure while being spun around upside down.But she was afraid of a tattoo needle.Man, I miss those guys.Jesus Christ, Id give anything for a five minute conversation with anyone.Anyone, anywhere.About anything.Im the first person to be alone on an entire planet.Okay, enough moping.I am having a conversation with someone: whoever reads this log.Its a bit one sided but itll have to do.I might die, but damn it, someone will know what I had to say.And the whole point of this trip is to get a radio.I could be reconnected with mankind before I even die.So heres another first: Tomorrow Ill be the first person to recover a Mars probe.LOG ENTRY: SOL 82  Victory!I found it!I knew I was in the right area when I spotted Twin Peaks in the distance.The two small hills are under a kilometer from the landing site.Even better, they were on the far side of the site.All I had to do was aim for them until I found the lander.And there it was!Right where it was supposed to be!I excitedly stumbled out and rushed to the site.Pathfinders final stage of descent was a balloon covered tetrahedron.The balloons absorbed the impact of landing.Once it came to rest, they deflated, and the tetrahedron unfolded to reveal the probe.Its actually two separate components.The lander itself, and the Sojourner rover.The lander was immobile, while Sojourner wandered around and got a good look at the local rocks.Im taking both back with me, but the important part is the lander.Thats the part that can communicate with Earth.I cant explain how happy I was to find it.It was a lot of work to get here, and Id succeeded.The lander was half buried.With some quick and careful digging, I exposed the bulk of it, though the large tetrahedron and the deflated balloons still lurked below the surface.After a quick search, I found Sojourner.The little fella was only two meters from the lander.I vaguely remember it was farther away when they last saw it.It probably entered a contingency mode and started circling the lander, trying to communicate.I quickly deposited Sojourner in my rover.Its small, light, and easily fit in the airlock.The lander was a different story.I had no hope of getting the whole thing back to the Hab.It was just too big, but I only needed the probe itself.It was time for me to put on my mechanical engineer hat.The probe was on the central panel of the unfolded tetrahedron.The other three sides were each attached to the central panel with a metal hinge.As anyone at JPL will tell you, probes are delicate things.Weight is a serious concern, so theyre not made to stand up to much punishment.When I took a crowbar to the hinges, they popped right off!Then things got difficult.When I tried to lift the central panel assembly, it didnt budge.Just like the other three panels, the central panel had deflated balloons underneath it.Over the decades, the balloons had ripped and filled with sand.I could cut off the balloons, but Id have to dig to get to them.It wouldnt be hard, its just sand.But the other three panels were in the damn way.I quickly realized I didnt give a crap about the condition of the other panels.I went back to my rover, cut some strips of Hab material, then braided them into a primitive but strong rope.I cant take credit for it being strong.Thank NASA for that.I just made it rope shaped.I tied one end to a panel and the other to the rover.The rover was made for traversing extremely rugged terrain, often at steep angles.It may not be fast, but it has great torque.I towed the panel away like a redneck removing a tree stump.Now I had a place to dig.As I exposed each balloon, I cut it off.The whole task took an hour.Then I hoisted the central panel assembly up and carried it confidently to the rover!At least, thats what I wanted to do.The damn thing is still heavy as hell.Im guessing its 200 kilograms.Even in Marss gravity thats a bit much.I could carry it around the Hab easily enough, but lifting it while wearing an awkward EVA suit?Out of the question.So I dragged it to the rover.Now for my next feat: getting it on the roof.The roof was empty at the moment.Even with mostly full batteries, I had set up the solar cells when I stopped.Why not?Free energy.Id worked it out in advance.On the way here, two stacks of solar panels occupied the whole roof.On the way back, Ill use a single stack to make room for the probe.Its a little more dangerous; the stack might fall over.Also, the cells will be a pain in the ass to stack that high.But Ill get it done.I cant just throw a rope over the rover and hoist Pathfinder up the side.I dont want to break it.I mean, its already broken; they lost contact in 1997.But I dont want to break it more.I came up with a solution, but Id done enough physical labor for one day, and I was almost out of daylight.Now Im in the rover, looking at Sojourner.It seems all right.No physical damage on the outside.Doesnt look like anything got too baked by the sunlight.The dense layer of Mars crap all over it protected it from long term solar damage.You may think Sojourner isnt much use to me.It cant communicate with Earth.Why do I care about it?Because it has a lot of moving parts.If I establish a link with NASA, I can talk to them by holding a page of text up to the landers camera.But how would they talk to me?The only moving parts on the lander are the high gain antenna (which would have to stay pointed at Earth) and the camera boom.Wed have to come up with a system where NASA could talk by rotating the camera head.It would be painfully slow.But Sojourner has six independent wheels that rotate reasonably fast.Itll be much easier to communicate with those.I could draw letters on the wheels.NASA could rotate them to spell things at me.That all assumes I can get the landers radio working at all.Time to turn in.Ive got a lot of backbreaking physical labor to do tomorrow.Ill need my rest.LOG ENTRY: SOL 83  Oh God, Im sore.But its the only way I could think of to get the lander safely onto the roof.I built a ramp out of rocks and sand.Just like the ancient Egyptians did.And if theres one thing Ares Vallis has, its rocks!First, I experimented to find out how steep the grade could be.I piled some rocks near the lander and dragged it up the pile and back down again.Then I made the pile steeper and made sure I could drag the lander up and down.I repeated this over and over until I found the best grade for my ramp: 30 degrees.Anything more was too risky.I might lose my grip and send the lander tumbling down the ramp.The roof of the rover is over two meters from the ground.So Id need a ramp almost four meters long.I got to work.The first few rocks were easy.Then they started feeling heavier and heavier.Hard physical labor in a space suit is murder.Everythings more effort because youre lugging 20 kilograms of suit around with you, and your movement is limited.I was panting within twenty minutes.So I cheated.I upped my O2 mixture.It really helped a lot.Probably shouldnt make that a habit.Also, I didnt get hot.The suit leaks heat faster than my body could ever generate it.The heating system is what keeps the temperature bearable.My physical labor just meant the suit didnt have to heat itself as much.After hours of grueling labor, I finally got the ramp made.Nothing more than a pile of rocks against the rover, but it reached the roof.I stomped up and down the ramp first, to make sure it was stable, then I dragged the lander up.It worked like a charm!I was all smiles as I lashed the lander in place.I made sure it was firmly secured, and even stacked the solar cells in a big single stack (why waste the ramp?).But then it hit me.The ramp would collapse as I drove away, and the rocks might damage the wheels or undercarriage.Id have to take the ramp apart to keep that from happening.Ugh.Tearing the ramp down was easier than putting it up.I didnt need to carefully put each rock in a stable place.I just dropped them wherever.It only took me an hour.And now Im done!Ill start heading home tomorrow, with my new 200 kilogram broken radio.Chapter 10      LOG ENTRY: SOL 90  Seven days since Pathfinder, and seven days closer to home.As Id hoped, my inbound tracks gave me a path back to Lewis Valley.Then it was four sols of easy driving.The hills to my left made it impossible to get lost, and the terrain was smooth.But all good things come to an end.Im back in Acidalia Planitia now.My outgoing tracks are long gone.Its been sixteen days since I was last here.Even timid weather would clear them out in that time.On my way out, I should have made a pile of rocks every time I camped.The land is so flat theyd be visible for kilometers.On second thought, thinking back to making that damn ramp ugh.So once again I am the desert wanderer, using Phobos to navigate and hoping I dont stray too far.All I need to do is get within 40 kilometers of the Hab and Ill pick up the beacon.Im feeling optimistic.For the first time, I think I might get off this planet alive.With that in mind, Im taking soil and rock samples every time I do an EVA.At first, I figured it was my duty.If I survive, geologists will love me for it.But then it started to get fun.Now, as I drive, I look forward to that simple act of bagging rocks.It just feels nice to be an astronaut again.Thats all it is.Not a reluctant farmer, not an electrical engineer, not a long haul trucker.An astronaut.Im doing what astronauts do.I missed it.LOG ENTRY: SOL 92  I got two seconds of signal from the Hab beacon today, then lost it.But its a good sign.Ive been traveling vaguely north northwest for two days.I must be a good hundred kilometers from the Hab; its a miracle I got any signal at all.Must have been a moment of perfect weather conditions.During the boring ass days, Im working my way through The Six Million Dollar Man from Commander Lewiss inexhaustible collection of seventies tripe.I just watched an episode where Steve Austin fights a Russian Venus probe that landed on Earth by mistake.As an expert in interplanetary travel, I can tell you there are no scientific inaccuracies in the story.Its quite common for probes to land on the wrong planet.Also, the probes large, flat panel hull is ideal for the high pressure Venusian atmosphere.And, as we all know, probes often refuse to obey directives, choosing instead to attack humans on sight.So far, Pathfinder hasnt tried to kill me.But Im keeping an eye on it.LOG ENTRY: SOL 93  I found the Hab signal today.No more chance to get lost.According to the computer, Im 24,718 meters away.Ill be home tomorrow.Even if the rover has a catastrophic failure, Ill be fine.I can walk to the Hab from here.I dont know if Ive mentioned this before, but I am really fucking sick of being in this rover.Ive spent so much time seated or lying down, my back is all screwed up.Of all my crewmates, the one I miss most right now is Beck.Hed fix my aching back.Though hed probably give me a bunch of shit about it.Why didnt you do stretching exercises?Your body is important!Eat more fiber, or whatever.At this point, Id welcome a health lecture.During training, we had to practice the dreaded Missed Orbit scenario.In the event of a second stage failure during MAV ascent, wed be in orbit, but too low to reach Hermes.Wed be skimming the upper atmosphere, so our orbit would rapidly decay.NASA would remotely operate Hermes and bring it in to pick us up.Then wed get the hell out of there before Hermes caught too much drag.To drill this, they made us stay in the MAV simulator for three miserable days.Six people in an ascent vehicle originally designed for a twenty three minute flight.It got a little cramped.And by a little cramped I mean we wanted to kill each other.Id give anything to be in that cramped capsule with those guys again.Man, I hope I get Pathfinder working again.LOG ENTRY: SOL 94  Home sweet home!Today I write from my gigantic, cavernous Hab!The first thing I did when I got in was wave my arms wildly while running in circles.Felt great!I was in that damn rover for twenty two sols and couldnt even walk without suiting up.Ill need to endure twice that to get to Ares 4, but thats a problem for later.After a few celebratory laps around the Hab, it was time to get to work.First, I fired up the oxygenator and atmospheric regulator.Checking the air levels, everything looked good.There was still CO2, so the plants hadnt suffocated without me exhaling for them.Naturally I did an exhaustive check on my crops, and theyre all healthy.I added my bags of shit to the manure pile.Lovely smell, I can tell you.But once I mixed some soil in, it died down to tolerable levels.I dumped my box o pee into the water reclaimer.Id been gone over three weeks and had left the Hab very humid for the sake of the crops.That much water in the air can cause any amount of electrical problems, so I spent the next few hours doing full systems checks on everything.Then I kind of lounged around for a while.I wanted to spend the rest of the day relaxing, but I had more to do.After suiting up, I went out to the rover and dragged the solar cells off the roof.Over the next few hours, I put them back where they belonged, wiring them into the Habs power grid.Getting the lander off the roof was a hell of a lot easier than getting it up there.I detached a strut from the MAV platform and dragged it over to the rover.By leaning it against the hull and digging the other end into the ground for stability, I had a ramp.I should have brought that strut with me to the Pathfinder site.Live and learn.Theres no way to get the lander in the airlock.Its just too big.I could probably dismantle it and bring it in a piece at a time, but theres a pretty compelling reason not to.With no magnetic field, Mars has no defense against harsh solar radiation.If I were exposed to it, Id get so much cancer, the cancer would have cancer.So the Hab canvas shields from electromagnetic waves.This means the Hab itself would block any transmissions if the lander were inside.Speaking of cancer, it was time to get rid of the RTG.It pained me to climb back into the rover, but it had to be done.If the RTG ever broke open, it would kill me to death.NASA decided four kilometers was the safe distance, and I wasnt about to second guess them.I drove back to where Commander Lewis had originally dumped it, ditched it in the same hole, and drove back to the Hab.Ill start work on the lander tomorrow.Now to enjoy a good, long sleep in an actual cot.With the comforting knowledge that when I wake, my morning piss will go into a toilet.LOG ENTRY: SOL 95  Today was all about repairs!The Pathfinder mission ended because the lander had an unknown critical failure.Once JPL lost contact with the lander, they had no idea what became of Sojourner.It might be in better shape.Maybe it just needs power.Power it couldnt get with its solar panels hopelessly caked with dust.I set the little rover on my workbench and pried open a panel to peek inside.The battery was a lithium thionyl chloride nonrechargeable.I figured that out from some subtle clues: the shape of the connection points, the thickness of the insulation, and the fact that it had LiSOCl2 NON RCHRG written on it.I cleaned the solar panels thoroughly, then aimed a small, flexible lamp directly at them.The batterys long dead.But the panels might be okay, and Sojourner can operate directly off them.Well see if anything happens.Then it was time to take a look at Sojourners daddy.I suited up and headed out.On most landers, the weak point is the battery.Its the most delicate component, and when it dies, theres no way to recover.Landers cant just shut down and wait when they have low batteries.Their electronics wont work unless theyre at a minimum temperature.So they have heaters to keep the electronics warm.Its a problem that rarely comes up on Earth, but hey.Mars.Over time, the solar panels get covered with dust.Then winter brings colder temperatures and less daylight.This all combines into a big fuck you from Mars to your lander.Eventually its using more power to keep warm than its getting from the meager daylight that makes it through the dust.Once the battery runs down, the electronics get too cold to operate, and the whole system dies.The solar panels will recharge the battery somewhat, but theres nothing to tell the system to reboot.Anything that could make that decision would be electronics, which would not be working.Eventually, the now unused battery will lose its ability to retain charge.Thats the usual cause of death.And I sure hope its what killed Pathfinder.I piled some leftover parts of the MDV into a makeshift table and ramp.Then I dragged the lander up to my new outdoor workbench.Working in an EVA suit is annoying enough.Bending over the whole time would have been torture.I got my tool kit and started poking around.Opening the outer panel wasnt too hard and I identified the battery easily enough.JPL labels everything.Its a 40 amp hour Ag Zn battery with an optimal voltage of 1.5.Wow.They really made those things run on nothin back then.I detached the battery and headed back inside.I checked it with my electronics kit, and sure enough its dead, dead, dead.I could shuffle across a carpet and hold more charge.But I knew what the lander needed: 1.5 volts.Compared to the makeshift crap Ive been gluing together since Sol 6, this was a breeze.I have voltage controllers in my kit!It only took me fifteen minutes to put a controller on a reserve power line, then another hour to go outside and run the line to where the battery used to be.Then theres the issue of heat.Its a good idea to keep electronics above 40C.The temperature today is a brisk 63C.The battery was big and easy to identify, but I had no clue where the heaters were.Even if I knew, itd be too risky to hook them directly to power.I could easily fry the whole system.So instead, I went to good old Spare Parts Rover 1 and stole its environment heater.Ive gutted that poor rover so much, it looks like I parked it in a bad part of town.I lugged the heater to my outdoor workbench, and hooked it to Hab power.Then I rested it in the lander where the battery used to be.Now I wait.And hope.LOG ENTRY: SOL 96  I was really hoping Id wake up to a functional lander, but no such luck.Its high gain antenna is right where I last saw it.Why does that matter?Well, Ill tell ya  If the lander comes back to life (and thats a big if), itll try to establish contact with Earth.Problem is nobodys listening.Its not like the Pathfinder team is hanging around JPL just in case their long dead probe is repaired by a wayward astronaut.The Deep Space Network and SETI are my best bets for picking up the signal.If either of them caught a blip from Pathfinder, theyd tell JPL.JPL would quickly figure out what was going on, especially when they triangulated the signal to my landing site.Theyd tell the lander where Earth is, and it would angle the high gain antenna appropriately.That there, the angling of the antenna, is how Ill know if it linked up.So far, no action.Theres still hope.Any number of reasons could be delaying things.The rover heater is designed to heat air at one atmosphere, and the thin Martian air severely hampers its ability to work.So the electronics might need more time to warm up.Also, Earth is only visible during the day.I (hopefully) fixed the lander yesterday evening.Its morning now, so most of the intervening time has been night.No Earth.Sojourners showing no signs of life, either.Its been in the nice, warm environment of the Hab all night, with plenty of light on its sparkling clean solar cells.Maybe its running an extended self check, or staying still until it hears from the lander or something.Ill just have to put it out of my mind for now.Pathfinder LOG: SOL 0  BOOT SEQUENCE INITIATED  TIME 00:00:00  LOSS OF

Somethings coming in yes yes!Its Pathfinder!The crowded room burst into applause and cheers.Venkat slapped an unknown technician on the back while Bruce pumped his fist in the air.The ad hoc Pathfinder control center was an accomplishment in itself.Over the last twenty days, a team of JPL engineers had worked around the clock to piece together antiquated computers, repair broken components, network everything, and install hastily made software that allowed the old systems to interact with the modern Deep Space Network.The room itself was formerly a conference room; JPL had no space ready for the sudden need.Already jam packed with computers and equipment, the cramped space had turned positively claustrophobic with the many spectators now squeezing into it.One Associated Press camera team pressed against the back wall, tryingand failingto stay out of everyones way while recording the auspicious moment.The rest of the media would have to satisfy themselves with the live AP feed, and await a press conference.Venkat turned to Bruce.God damn, Bruce.You really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time!Good work!Im just the director, Bruce said modestly.Thank the guys who got all this stuff working.Oh I will!Venkat beamed.But first I have to talk to my new best friend!Turning to the headsetted man at the communications console, Venkat asked, Whats your name, new best friend?Tim, he said, not taking his eyes off the screen.What now?Venkat asked.We sent the return telemetry automatically.Itll get there in just over eleven minutes.Once it does, Pathfinder will start high gain transmissions.So itll be twenty two minutes till we hear from it again.Venkats got a doctorate in physics, Tim, Bruce said.You dont need to explain transmission time to him.Tim shrugged.You can never tell with managers.What was in the transmission we got?Venkat asked.Just the bare bones.A hardware self check.Its got a lot of nonfunctional systems, cause they were on the panels Watney removed.What about the camera?It says the imagers working.Well have it take a panorama as soon as we can.LOG ENTRY: SOL 97  It worked!Holy shit, it worked!I just suited up and checked the lander.The high gain antenna is angled directly at Earth!
