Isn't that odd?""That's very odd. "Paul strained at memories, tried to recall the sound of Chani breathing beside him in the night.Where is there comfort?he wondered.All he could remember was Chani at breakfast the day they'd left for the desert.She'd been restless, irritable."Why do you wear that old jacket?"she'd demanded, eyeing the black uniform coat with its red hawk crest beneath his Fremen robes."You're an Emperor!""Even an Emperor has his favorite clothing," he'd said.For no reason he could explain, this had brought real tears to Chani's eyes   the second time in her life when Fremen inhibitions had been shattered.Now, in the darkness, Paul rubbed his own cheeks, felt moisture there.Who gives moisture to the dead?he wondered.It was his own face, yet not his.The wind chilled the wet skin.A frail dream formed, broke.What was this swelling in his breast?Was it something he'd eaten?How bitter and plaintive was this other self, giving moisture to the dead.The wind bristled with sand.The skin, dry now, was his own.But whose was the quivering which remained?They heard the wailing then, far away in the sietch depths.It grew louder...louder...The ghola whirled at a sudden glare of light, someone flinging wide the entrance seals.In the light, he saw a man with a raffish grin   no!Not a grin, but a grimace of grief!It was a Fedaykin lieutenant named Tandis.Behind him came a press of many people, all fallen silent now that they saw Muad'dib."Chani... "Tandis said."Is dead," Paul whispered."I heard her call. "He turned toward the sietch.He knew this place.It was a place where he could not hide.His onrushing vision illuminated the entire Fremen mob.He saw Tandis, felt the Fedaykin's grief, the fear and anger."She is gone," Paul said.The ghola heard the words out of a blazing corona.They burned his chest, his backbone, the sockets of his metal eyes.He felt his right hand move toward the knife at his belt.His own thinking became strange, disjointed.He was a puppet held fast by strings reaching down from that awful corona.He moved to another's commands, to another's desires.The strings jerked his arms, his legs, his jaw.Sounds came squeezing out of his mouth, a terrifying repetitive noise    "Hrrak!Hraak!Hraak!"The knife came up to strike.In that instant, he grabbed his own voice, shaped rasping words: "Run!Young master, run!""We will not run," Paul said."We'll move with dignity.We'll do what must be done. "The ghola's muscles locked.He shuddered, swayed."...what must be done!"The words rolled in his mind like a great fish surfacing."...what must be done!"Ahhh, that had sounded like the old Duke, Paul's grandfather.The young master had some of the old man in him."...what must be done!"The words began to unfold in the ghola's consciousness.A sensation of living two lives simultaneously spread out through his awareness: Hayt/Idaho/Hayt/Idaho...He became a motionless chain of relative existence, singular, alone.Old memories flooded his mind.He marked them, adjusted them to new understandings, made a beginning at the integration of a new awareness.A new persona achieved a temporary form of internal tyranny.The masculating synthesis remained charged with potential disorder, but events pressed him to the temporary adjustment.The young master needed him.It was done then.He knew himself as Duncan Idaho, remembering everything of Hayt as though it had been stored secretly in him and ignited by a flaming catalyst.The corona dissolved.He shed the Tleilaxu compulsions."Stay close to me, Duncan," Paul said."I'll need to depend on you for many things. "And, as Idaho continued to stand entranced: "Duncan!""Yes, I am Duncan. ""Of course you are!This was the moment when you came back.We'll go inside now. "Idaho fell into step beside Paul.It was like the old times, yet not like them.Now that he stood free of the Tleilaxu, he could appreciate what they had given him.Zensunni training permitted him to overcome the shock of events.The mentat accomplishment formed a counterbalance.He put off all fear, standing above the source.His entire consciousness looked outward from a position of infinite wonder: he had, been dead; he was alive."Sire," the Fedaykin Tandis said as they approached him, "the woman, Lichna, says she must see you.I told her to wait. ""Thank you," Paul said."The birth...  ""I spoke to the medics," Tandis said, falling into step."They said you have two children, both of them alive and sound. ""Two?"Paul stumbled, caught himself on Idaho's arm."A boy and a girl," Tandis said."I saw them.They're good Fremen babies. ""How...how did she die?"Paul whispered."M'Lord?"Tandis bent close."Chani?"Paul said."It was the birth, m'Lord," Tandis husked."They said her body was drained by the speed of it.I don't understand, but that is what they said. ""Take me to her," Paul whispered."M'Lord?""Take me to her!""That's where we're going, m'Lord. "Again, Tandis bent close to Paul."Why does your ghola carry a bared knife?""Duncan, put away your knife," Paul said."The time for violence is past. "As he spoke, Paul felt closer to the sound of his voice than to the mechanism which had created the sound.Two babies!The vision had contained but one.Yet, these moments went as the vision went.There was a person here who felt grief and anger.Someone.His own awareness lay in the grip of an awful treadmill, replaying his life from memory.Two babies?Again he stumbled.Chani, Chani, he thought.There was no other way.Chani, beloved, believe me that this death was quicker for you...and kinder.They'd have held our children hostage, displayed you in a cage and slave pits, reviled you with the blame for my death.This way...this way we destroy them and save our children.Children?Once more, he stumbled.I permitted this, he thought.I should feel guilty.The sound of noisy confusion filled the cavern ahead of them.It grew louder precisely as he remembered it growing louder.Yes, this was the pattern, the inexorable pattern, even with two children.Chani is dead, he told himself.At some faraway instant in a past which he had shared with others, this future had reached down to him.It had chivvied him and herded him into a chasm whose walls grew narrower and narrower.He could feel them closing in on him.This was the way the vision went.Chani is dead.I should abandon myself to grief.But that was not the way the vision went."Has Alia been summoned?"he asked."She is with Chani's friends," Tandis said.Paul sensed the mob pressing back to give him passage.Their silence moved ahead of him like a wave.The noisy confusion began dying down.A sense of congested emotion filled the sietch.He wanted to remove the people from his vision, found it impossible.Every face turning to follow him carried its special imprint.They were pitiless with curiosity, those faces.They felt grief, yes, but he understood the cruelty which drenched them.They were watching the articulate become dumb, the wise become a fool.Didn't the clown always appeal to cruelty?This was more than a deathwatch, less than a wake.Paul felt his soul begging for respite, but still the vision moved him.Just a little farther now, he told himself.Black, visionless dark awaited him just ahead.There lay the place ripped out of the vision by grief and guilt, the place where the moon fell.He stumbled into it, would've fallen had Idaho not taken his arm in a fierce grip, a solid presence knowing how to share his grief in silence."Here is the place," Tandis said."Watch your step, Sire," Idaho said, helping him over an entrance lip.Hangings brushed Paul's face.Idaho pulled him to a halt.Paul felt the room then, a reflection against his cheeks and ears.It was a rock walled space with the rock hidden behind tapestries."Where is Chani?"Paul whispered.Harah's voice answered him: "She is right here, Usul. "Paul heaved a trembling sigh.He had feared her body already had been removed to the stills where Fremen reclaimed the water of the tribe.Was that the way the vision went?He felt abandoned in his blindness."The children?"Paul asked."They are here, too, m'Lord," Idaho said."You have beautiful twins, Usul," Harah said, "a boy and a girl.See?We have them here in a creche. "Two children, Paul thought wonderingly.The vision had contained only a daughter.He cast himself adrift from Idaho's arm, moved toward the place where Harah had spoken, stumbled into a hard surface.His hands explored it: the metaglass outlines of a creche.Someone took his left arm."Usul?"It was Harah.She guided his hand into the creche.He felt soft soft flesh.It was so warm!He felt ribs, breathing."That is your son," Harah whispered.She moved his hand."And this is your daughter. "Her hand tightened on his."Usul, are you truly blind now?"He knew what she was thinking.The blind must be abandoned in the desert.Fremen tribes carried no dead weight."Take me to Chani," Paul said, ignoring her question.Harah turned him, guided him to the left.Paul felt himself accepting now the fact that Chani was dead.He had taken his place in a universe he did not want, wearing flesh that did not fit.Every breath he drew bruised his emotions.Two children!He wondered if he had committed himself to a passage where his vision would never return.It seemed unimportant."Where is my brother?"It was Alia's voice behind him.He heard the rush of her, the overwhelming presence as she took his arm from Harah."I must speak to you!"Alia hissed."In a moment," Paul said."Now!It's about Lichna. ""I know," Paul said."In a moment. ""You don't have a moment!""I have many moments. ""But Chani doesn't!""Be still!"he ordered."Chani is dead. "He put a hand across her mouth as she started to protest."I order you to be still!"He felt her subside and removed his hand."Describe what you see," he said."Paul!"Frustration and tears battled in her voice."Never mind," he said.And he forced himself to inner stillness, opened the eyes of his vision to this moment.Yes   it was still here.Chani's body lay on a pallet within a ring of light.Someone had straightened her white robe, smoothed it trying to hide the blood from the birth.No matter; he could not turn his awareness from the vision of her face: such a mirror of eternity in the still features!He turned away, but the vision moved with him.She was gone...never to return.The air, the universe, all vacant   everywhere vacant.Was this the essence of his penance?he wondered.He wanted tears, but they would not come.Had he lived too long a Fremen?This death demanded its moisture!Nearby, a baby cried and was hushed.The sound pulled a curtain on his vision.Paul welcomed the darkness.This is another world, he thought.Two children.The thought came out of some lost oracular trance.He tried to recapture the timeless mind dilation of the melange, but awareness fell short.No burst of the future came into this new consciousness.He felt himself rejecting the future   any future."Goodbye, my Sihaya," he whispered.Alia's voice, harsh and demanding, came from somewhere behind him."I've brought Lichna!"Paul turned."That's not Lichna," he said."That's a Face Dancer.Lichna's dead. ""But hear what she says," Alia said.Slowly, Paul moved toward his sister's voice."I'm not surprised to find you alive, Atreides. "The voice was like Lichna's, but with subtle differences, as though the speaker used Lichna's vocal cords, but no longer bothered to control them sufficiently.Paul found himself struck by an odd note of honesty in the voice."Not surprised?"Paul asked."I am Scytale, a Tleilaxu of the Face Dancers, and I would know a thing before we bargain.Is that a ghola I see behind you, or Duncan Idaho?""It's Duncan Idaho," Paul said."And I will not bargain with you. ""I think you'll bargain," Scytale said."Duncan," Paul said, speaking over his shoulder, "will you kill this Tleilaxu if I ask it?""Yes, m'Lord. "There was the suppressed rage of a berserker in Idaho's voice."Wait!"Alia said."You don't know what you're rejecting. ""But I do know," Paul said."So it's truly Duncan Idaho of the Atreides," Scytale said."We found the lever!A ghola can regain his past. "Paul heard footsteps.Someone brushed past him on the left.Scytale's voice came from behind him now."What do you remember of your past, Duncan?""Everything.From my childhood on.I even remember you at the tank when they removed me from it," Idaho said."Wonderful," Scytale breathed."Wonderful. "Paul heard the voice moving.I need a vision, he thought.Darkness frustrated him.Bene Gesserit training warned him of terrifying menace in Scytale, yet the creature remained a voice, a shadow of movement   entirely beyond him."Are these the Atreides babies?"Scytale asked."Harah!"Paul cried."Get her away from there!""Stay where you are!"Scytale shouted."All of you!I warn you, a Face Dancer can move faster than you suspect.My knife can have both these lives before you touch me. "Paul felt someone touch his right arm, then move off to the right."That's far enough, Alia," Scytale said."Alia," Paul said."Don't. ""It's my fault," Alia groaned."My fault!""Atreides," Scytale said, "shall we bargain now?"Behind him, Paul heard a single hoarse curse.His throat constricted at the suppressed violence in Idaho's voice.Idaho must not break!Scytale would kill the babies!"To strike a bargain, one requires a thing to sell," Scytale said."Not so, Atreides?Will you have your Chani back?We can restore her to you.A ghola, Atreides.A ghola with full memory!But we must hurry.Call your friends to bring a cryologic tank to preserve the flesh. "To hear Chani's voice once more, Paul thought.To feel her presence beside me.Ahhh, that's why they gave me Idaho as a ghola, to let me discover how much the re creation is like the original.But now   full restoration...at their price.I'd be a Tleilaxu tool forevermore.And Chani...chained to the same fate by a threat to our children, exposed once more to the Qizarate's plotting..."What pressures would you use to restore Chani's memory to her?"Paul asked, fighting to keep his voice calm."Would you condition her to...to kill one of her own children?""We use whatever pressures we need," Scytale said."What say you, Atreides?""Alia," Paul said, "bargain with this thing.I cannot bargain with what I cannot see. ""A wise choice," Scytale gloated."Well, Alia, what do you offer me as your brother's agent?"Paul lowered his head, bringing himself to stillness within stillness.He'd glimpsed something just then   like a vision, but not a vision.It had been a knife close to him.There!"Give me a moment to think," Alia said."My knife is patient," Scytale said, "but Chani's flesh is not.Take a reasonable amount of time. "Paul felt himself blinking.It could not be...but it was!He felt eyes!Their vantage point was odd and they moved in an erratic way.There!The knife swam into his view.With a breath stilling shock, Paul recognized the viewpoint.It was that of one of his children!He was seeing Scytale's knife hand from within the creche!It glittered only inches from him.Yes   and he could see himself across the room, as well   head down, standing quietly, a figure of no menace, ignored by the others in this room."To begin, you might assign us all your CHOAM holdings," Scytale suggested."All of them?"Alia protested."All. "Watching himself through the eyes in the creche, Paul slipped his crysknife from its belt sheath.The movement produced a strange sensation of duality.He measured the distance, the angle.There'd be no second chance.He prepared his body then in the Bene Gesserit way, armed himself like a cocked spring for a single concentrated movement, a prajna thing requiring all his muscles balanced in one exquisite unity.The crysknife leaped from his hand.The milky blur of it flashed into Scytale's right eye, jerked the Face Dancer's head back.Scytale threw both hands up and staggered backward against the wall.His knife clattered off the ceiling, to hit the floor.Scytale rebounded from the wall; he fell face forward, dead before he touched the floor.Still through the eyes in the creche, Paul watched the faces in the room turn toward his eyeless figure, read the combined shock.Then Alia rushed to the creche, bent over it and hid the view from him."Oh, they're safe," Alia said."They're safe. ""M'Lord," Idaho whispered, "was that part of your vision?""No. "He waved a hand in Idaho's direction."Let it be. ""Forgive me, Paul," Alia said."But when that creature said they could...revive...  ""There are some prices an Atreides cannot pay," Paul said."You know that. ""I know," she sighed."But I was tempted...  ""Who was not tempted?"Paul asked.He turned away from them, groped his way to a wall, leaned against it and tried to understand what he had done.How?How?The eyes in the creche!He felt poised on the brink of terrifying revelation."My eyes, father. "The word shapings shimmered before his sightless vision."My son!"Paul whispered, too low for any to hear."You're...aware. ""Yes, father.Look!"Paul sagged against the wall in a spasm of dizziness.He felt that he'd been upended and drained.His own life whipped past him.He saw his father.He was his father.And the grandfather, and the grandfathers before that.His awareness tumbled through a mind shattering corridor of his whole male line."How?"he asked silently.Faint word shapings appeared, faded and were gone, as though the strain was too great.Paul wiped saliva from the corner of his mouth.He remembered the awakening of Alia in the Lady Jessica's womb.But there had been no Water of Life, no overdose of melange this time...or had there?Had Chani's hunger been for that?Or was this somehow the genetic product of his line, foreseen by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?Paul felt himself in the creche then, with Alia cooing over him.Her hands soothed him.Her face loomed, a giant thing directly over him.She turned him then and he saw his creche companion   a girl with that bony ribbed look of strength which came from a desert heritage.She had a full head of tawny red hair.As he stared, she opened her eyes.Those eyes!Chani peered out of her eyes...and the Lady Jessica.A multitude peered out of those eyes."Look at that," Alia said."They're staring at each other. ""Babies can't focus at this age," Harah said."I could," Alia said.Slowly, Paul felt himself being disengaged from that endless awareness.He was back at his own wailing wall then, leaning against it.Idaho shook his shoulder gently."M'Lord?""Let my son be called Leto for my father," Paul said, straightening."At the time of naming," Harah said, "I will stand beside you as a friend of the mother and give that name. ""And my daughter," Paul said."Let her be called Ghanima. ""Usul!"Harah objected."Ghanima's an ill omened name. ""It saved your life," Paul said."What matter that Alia made fun of you with that name?My daughter is Ghanima, a spoil of war. "Paul heard wheels squeak behind him then   the pallet with Chani's body being moved.The chant of the Water Rite began."Hal yawm!"Harah said."I must leave now if I am to be the observer of the holy truth and stand beside my friend for the last time.Her water belongs to the tribe. ""Her water belongs to the tribe," Paul murmured.He heard Harah leave.He groped outward and found Idaho's sleeve."Take me to my quarters, Duncan. "Inside his quarters, he shook himself free gently.It was a time to be alone.But before Idaho could leave there was a disturbance at the door."Master!"It was Bijaz calling from the doorway."Duncan," Paul said, "let him come two paces forward.Kill him if he comes farther. ""Ayyah," Idaho said."Duncan is it?"Bijaz asked."Is it truly Duncan Idaho?""It is," Idaho said."I remember. ""Then Scytale's plan succeeded!""Scytale is dead," Paul said."But I am not and the plan is not," Bijaz said."By the tank in which I grew!It can be done!I shall have my pasts   all of them.It needs only the right trigger. ""Trigger?"Paul asked."The compulsion to kill you," Idaho said, rage thick in his voice."Mentat computation: They found that I thought of you as the son I never had.Rather than slay you, the true Duncan Idaho would take over the ghola body.But...it might have failed.Tell me, dwarf, if your plan had failed, if I'd killed him, what then?""Oh...then we'd have bargained with the sister to save her brother.But this way the bargaining is better. "Paul took a shuddering breath.He could hear the mourners moving down the last passage now toward the deep rooms and the water stills."It's not too late, m'Lord," Bijaz said."Will you have your love back?We can restore her to you.A ghola, yes.But now   we hold out the full restoration.Shall we summon servants with a cryological tank, preserve the flesh of your beloved...  "It was harder now, Paul found.He had exhausted his powers in the first Tleilaxu temptation.And now all that was for nothing!To feel Chani's presence once more..."Silence him," Paul told Idaho, speaking in Atreides battle tongue.He heard Idaho move toward the door."Master!"Bijaz squeaked."As you love me," Paul said, still in battle tongue, "do me this favor: Kill him before I succumb!""Noooooo...  "Bijaz screamed.The sound stopped abruptly with a frightened grunt."I did him the kindness," Idaho said.Paul bent his head, listening.He no longer could hear the mourners.He thought of the ancient Fremen rite being performed now deep in the sietch, far down in the room of the death still where the tribe recovered its water."There was no choice," Paul said."You understand that, Duncan?""I understand. ""There are some things no one can bear.I meddled in all the possible futures I could create until, finally, they created me. ""M'Lord, you shouldn't... ""There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers," Paul said."Nothing.Nothing can be done. "As he spoke, Paul felt his link with the vision shatter.His mind cowered, overwhelmed by infinite possibilities.His lost vision became like the wind, blowing where it willed.= = = = = =   We say of Muad'dib that he has gone on a journey into that land where we walk without footprints.Preamble to the Qizarate Creed   There was a dike of water against the sand, an outer limit for the plantings of the sietch holding.A rock bridge came next and then the open desert beneath Idaho's feet.The promontory of Sietch Tabr dominated the night sky behind him.The light of both moons frosted its high rim.An orchard had been brought right down to the water.Idaho paused on the desert side and stared back at flowered branches over silent water   reflections and reality   four moons.The stillsuit felt greasy against his skin.Wet flint odors invaded his nostrils past the filters.There was a malignant simpering to the wind through the orchard.He listened for night sounds.Kangaroo mice inhabited the grass at the water verge; a hawk owl bounced its droning call into the cliff shadows; the wind broken hiss of a sandfall came from the open bled.Idaho turned toward the sound.He could see no movement out there on the moonlit dunes.It was Tandis who had brought Paul this far.Then the man had returned to tell his account.And Paul had walked out into the desert   like a Fremen."He was blind   truly blind," Tandis had said, as though that explained it."Before that, he had the vision which he told to us...but...  "A shrug.Blind Fremen were abandoned in the desert.Muad'dib might be Emperor, but he was also Fremen.Had he not made provision that Fremen guard and raise his children?He was Fremen.It was a skeleton desert here, Idaho saw.Moon silvered ribs of rock showed through the sand; then the dunes began.I should not have left him alone, not even for a minute, Idaho thought.I knew what was in his mind."He told me the future no longer needed his physical presence," Tandis had reported."When he left me.He called back.'Now I am free' were his words. "Damn them!Idaho thought.The Fremen had refused to send 'thopters or searchers of any kind.Rescue was against their ancient customs."There will be a worm for Muad'dib," they said.And they began the chant for those committed to the desert, the ones whose water went to Shai hulud: "Mother of sand, father of Time, beginning of Life, grant him passage. "Idaho seated himself on a flat rock and stared at the desert.The night out there was filled with camouflage patterns.There was no way to tell where Paul had gone."Now I am free. "Idaho spoke the words aloud, surprised by the sound of his own voice.For a time, he let his mind run, remembering a day when he'd taken the child Paul to the sea market on Caladan, the dazzling glare of a sun on water, the sea's riches brought up dead, there to be sold.Idaho remembered Gurney Halleck playing music of the baliset for them   pleasure, laughter.Rhythms pranced in his awareness, leading his mind like a thrall down channels of remembered delight.Gurney Halleck.Gurney would blame him for this tragedy.Memory music faded.He recalled Paul's words: "There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers. "Idaho began to wonder how Paul would die out there in the desert.Quickly, killed by a worm?Slowly, in the sun?Some of the Fremen back there in the sietch had said Muad'dib would never die, that he had entered the ruh world where all possible futures existed, that he would be present henceforth in the alam al mythal, wandering there endlessly even after his flesh had ceased to be.He'll die and I'm powerless to prevent it, Idaho thought.He began to realize that there might be a certain fastidious courtesy in dying without a trace   no remains, nothing, and an entire planet for a tomb.Mentat, solve thyself, he thought.Words intruded on his memory   the ritual words of the Fedaykin lieutenant, posting a guard over Muad'dib's children: "It shall be the solemn duty of the officer in charge...  "The plodding, self important language of government enraged him.It had seduced the Fremen.It had seduced everyone.A man, a great man, was dying out there, but language plodded on...and on...and on...What had happened, he wondered, to all the clean meanings that screened out nonsense?Somewhere, in some lost where which the Imperium had created, they'd been walled off, sealed against chance rediscovery.His mind quested for solutions, mentat fashion.Patterns of knowledge glistened there.Lorelei hair might shimmer thus, beckoning...beckoning the enchanted seaman into emerald caverns...With an abrupt start, Idaho drew back from catatonic forgetfulness.So!he thought.Rather than face my failure, I would disappear within myself!The instant of that almost plunge remained in his memory.Examining it, he felt his life stretch out as long as the existence of the universe.Real flesh lay condensed, finite in its emerald cavern of awareness, but infinite life had shared his being.Idaho stood up, feeling cleansed by the desert.Sand was beginning to chatter in the wind, pecking at the surfaces of leaves in the orchard behind him.There was the dry and abrasive smell of dust in the night air.His robe whipped to the pulse of a sudden gust.Somewhere far out in the bled, Idaho realized, a mother storm raged, lifting vortices of winding dust in hissing violence   a giant worm of sand powerful enough to cut flesh from bones.He will become one with the desert, Idaho thought.The desert will fulfill him.It was a Zensunni thought washing through his mind like clear water.Paul would go on marching out there, he knew.An Atreides would not give himself up completely to destiny, not even in the full awareness of the inevitable.A touch of prescience came over Idaho then, and he saw that people of the future would speak of Paul in terms of seas.Despite a life soaked in dust, water would follow him."His flesh foundered," they would say, "but he swam on. "Behind Idaho, a man cleared his throat.Idaho turned to discern the figure of Stilgar standing on the bridge over the qanat."He will not be found," Stilgar said."Yet all men will find him. ""The desert takes him   and deifies him," Idaho said."Yet he was an interloper here.He brought an alien chemistry to this planet   water. ""The desert imposes its own rhythms," Stilgar said."We welcomed him, called him our Mahdi, our Muad'dib, and gave him his secret name.Base of the Pillar: Usul. ""Still he was not born a Fremen. ""And that does not change the fact that we claimed him...and have claimed him finally. "Stilgar put a hand on Idaho's shoulder."All men are interlopers, old friend. ""You're a deep one, aren't you, Stil?""Deep enough.I can see how we clutter the universe with our migrations.Muad'dib gave us something uncluttered.Men will remember his Jihad for that, at least. ""He won't give up to the desert," Idaho said."He's blind, but he won't give up.He's a man of honor and principle.He was Atreides trained. ""And his water will be poured on the sand," Stilgar said."Come. "He pulled gently at Idaho's arm."Alia is back and is asking for you. ""She was with you at Sietch Makab?""Yes   she helped whip those soft Naibs into line.They take her orders now...as I do. ""What orders?""She commanded the execution of the traitors. ""Oh. "Idaho suppressed a feeling of vertigo as he looked up at the promontory."Which traitors?""The Guildsman, the Reverend Mother Mohiam, Korba...a few others. ""You slew a Reverend Mother?""I did.Muad'dib left word that it should not be done. "He shrugged."But I disobeyed him, as Alia knew I would. "Idaho stared again into the desert, feeling himself become whole, one person capable of seeing the pattern of what Paul had created.Judgment strategy, the Atreides called it in their training manuals.People are subordinate to government, but the ruled influence the rulers.Did the ruled have any concept, he wondered, of what they had helped create here?"Alia...  "Stilgar said, clearing his throat.He sounded embarrassed."She needs the comfort of your presence. ""And she is the government," Idaho murmured."A regency, no more. ""Fortune passes everywhere, as her father often said," Idaho muttered."We make our bargain with the future," Stilgar said."Will you come now?We need you back there. "Again, he sounded embarrassed."She is...distraught.She cries out against her brother one moment, mourns him the next. ""Presently," Idaho promised.He heard Stilgar leave.He stood facing into the rising wind, letting the grains of sand rattle against the stillsuit.Mentat awareness projected the outflowing patterns into the future.The possibilities dazzled him.Paul had set in motion a whirling vortex and nothing could stand in its path.The Bene Tleilax and the Guild had overplayed their hands and had lost, were discredited.The Qizarate was shaken by the treason of Korba and others high within it.And Paul's final voluntary act, his ultimate acceptance of their customs, had ensured the loyalty of the Fremen to him and to his house.He was one of them forever now."Paul is gone!"Alia's voice was choked.She had come up almost silently to where Idaho stood and was now beside him."He was a fool, Duncan!""Don't say that!"he snapped."The whole universe will say it before I'm through," she said."Why, for the love of heaven?""For the love of my brother, not of heaven. "Zensunni insight dilated his awareness.He could sense that there was no vision in her   had been none since Chani's death."You practice an odd love," he said."Love?Duncan, he had but to step off the track!What matter that the rest of the universe would have come shattering down behind him?He'd have been safe...and Chani with him!""Then...why didn't he?""For the love of heaven," she whispered.Then, more loudly, she said: "Paul's entire life was a struggle to escape his Jihad and its deification.At least, he's free of it.He chose this!""Ah, yes   the oracle. "Idaho shook his head in wonder."Even Chani's death.His moon fell. ""He was a fool, wasn't he, Duncan?"Idaho's throat tightened with suppressed grief."Such a fool!"Alia gasped her control breaking."He'll live forever while we must die!""Alia, don't...  ""It's just grief," she said, voice low."Just grief.Do you know what I must do for him?I must save the life of the Princess Irulan.That one!You should hear her grief.Wailing, giving moisture to the dead; she swears she loved him and knew it not.She reviles her Sisterhood, says she'll spend her life teaching Paul's children. ""You trust her?""She reeks of trustworthiness!""Ahhh," Idaho murmured.The final pattern unreeled before his awareness like a design on fabric.The defection of the Princess Irulan was the last step.It left the Bene Gesserit with no remaining lever against the Atreides heirs.Alia began to sob, leaned against him, face pressed into his chest."Ohhh, Duncan, Duncan!He's gone!"Idaho put his lips against her hair."Please," he whispered.He felt her grief mingling with his like two streams entering the same pool."I need you, Duncan," she sobbed."Love me!""I do," he whispered.She lifted her head, peered at the moon frosted outline of his face."I know, Duncan.Love knows love. "Her words sent a shudder through him, a feeling of estrangement from his old self.He had come out here looking for one thing and had found another.It was as though he'd lurched into a room full of familiar people only to realize too late that he knew none of them.She pushed away from him, took his hand."Will you come with me, Duncan?""Wherever you lead," he said.She led him back across the qanat into the darkness at the base of the massif and its Place of Safety.Epilogue   No bitter stench of funeral still for Muad'dib.No knell nor solemn rite to free the mind From avaricious shadows.He is the fool saint, The golden stranger living forever On the edge of reason.Let your guard fall and he is there!His crimson peace and sovereign pallor Strike into our universe on prophetic webs To the verge, of a quiet glance   there!Out of bristling star jungles: Mysterious, lethal, an oracle without eyes, Catspaw of prophecy, whose voice never dies!Shai hulud, he awaits thee upon a strand Where couples walk and fix, eye to eye, The delicious ennui of love.He strides through the long cavern of time, Scattering the fool self of his dream.The Ghola's Hymn skytell.da.ru
