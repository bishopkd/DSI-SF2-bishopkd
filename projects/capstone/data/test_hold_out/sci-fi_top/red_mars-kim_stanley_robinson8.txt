We can change the world in ways that help to actualize the divine pattern.Its always been our way: Islam says the desert does not remain desert, the mountain does not remain mountain.The world must be transformed into a semblance of the divine pattern, and that is what constitutes history in Islam.Al Qahira gives us the same challenge as the old world, except in a purer form.He would say these things to Frank as they sat around in his rover, in its tiny courtyard.These family rovers were transformed into private preserves, spaces that Frank was seldom invited into, and then only by Zeyk.Each time he visited he was surprised anew: the rover was nondescript from the exterior, big, with darkened windows, one of several parked in a bunch with walktubes between them.But then one ducked through a doorway and inside, and stepped into space filled with sunlight pouring down through skylights, illuminating couches and elaborate rugs, tiled floors, green leafed plants, bowls of fruit, a window with the Martian view tinted and framed like a photo, low couches, silver coffee urns, computer consoles of inlaid teak and mahogany, running water in pools and fountains.A cool wet world, green and white, intimate and small.Looking around Frank had the powerful sensation that rooms like this had existed for centuries, that the chamber would be instantly recognized for what it was by people living in the Empty Quarter in the tenth century, or across Asia in the twelfth.Often Zeyks invitations would come in the afternoon, when a group of men would convene in his rover for coffee and talk.Frank would sit in his spot near Zeyk, and sip his muddy coffee and listen to the Arabic with all the attention he could muster.It was a beautiful language, musical and intensely metaphoric, so that all their modern technical terminology resonated with desert imagery because of the root meanings of all the new words, which like most of their abstract terms had concrete physical origins.Arabic, like Greek, had been a scientific language early on, and this showed in many unexpected cognates with English, and in the organic and compact nature of the vocabulary.The conversations ran all over, but they were guided by Zeyk and the other elders, who were deferred to by the younger men in a way Frank found incredible.Many times the conversation became an overt lesson for Frank on Bedouin ways, which allowed him to nod and ask questions, and occasionally to offer comments or criticism.When you have a strong conservative streak in your society, Zeyk would say, which detaches itself from the progressive streak, thats when you get the worst kinds of civil wars.As in the conflict in Colombia that they called La Violencia, for instance.A civil war that became a complete breakdown of the state, a chaos that no one could understand, much less control.Or like Beirut, said Frank innocently.No, no.Zeyk smiled.Beirut was much more complex than that.It was not only civil war, but also a number of exterior wars impinging on it.It was not a matter of social or religious conservatives detaching from the normal progress of culture, as in Colombia or the Spanish Civil War.Spoken like a true progressive.All Qahiran Mahjaris are progressive by definition, or we would not be here.But Islam has avoided civil war by remaining a whole; we have a coherent culture, so that the Arabs here are still devout.This is understood even by the most conservative elements back home.We will never have civil war, because we are united by our faith.Frank let his expression alone speak the fact of the Shiite heresy, among many other Islamic civil wars.Zeyk understood the expression, but ignored it and forged on: We all move together through history, one loose caravan.You could say that we here on Al Qahira are like one of our prospecting rovers.And you know what a pleasure it is to be in one of those.So ...Frank thought hard about how to word his question; his inexperience with Arabic would only give him a certain amount of leeway before they got offended.Is there really the idea of social progress in Islam?Oh, certainly!Several of them had replied in the affirmative, and were nodding still.Zeyk said, Dont you think so?Well ...Frank let it pass.There still was not a single Arab democracy.It was a hierarchical culture with a premium put on honor and freedom, and for the many who were low down in the hierarchy, honor and freedom were only achievable by deference.Which reinforced the system and held it static.But what could he say?The destruction of Beirut was a disaster for progressive Arab culture, another man said.It was the city where intellectuals and artists and radicals went when they were attacked by their local governments.The national governments all hated the pan Arab ideal, but the fact is we speak one language across these several countries, and language is a powerful unifier of culture.Along with Islam it makes us one, really, despite the political borders.Beirut was always the place to affirm that position, and when the Israelis destroyed it, that affirmation became more difficult.The destruction was calculated to splinter us, and it did.So here we begin the work again.And that was their social progress.The stratiform copper deposit that they had been raking up ran dry, and it was time for another rhla, the movement of the hejra to the next site.They traveled two days, and arrived at another stratiform deposit that Frank had found.Frank went out again on another prospecting trip.For days he sat in the drivers seat, feet on the dash, watching the land roll by.They were in a region of thulleya or little ribs, parallel ridges running downslope.He never turned on the TV anymore; there was a lot to think about.The Arabs dont believe in original sin, he wrote in his lectern.They believe that man is innocent, and death natural.That we do not need a saviour.There is no heaven or hell, but only reward and punishment, which take the form of this life itself and how it is lived.It is a humanist correction of Judaism and Christianity, in that sense.Although in another sense they have always refused to take responsibility for their destiny.Its always Allahs will.I dont understand that contradiction.But now they are here.And the Mahjaris have always been an intimate part of Arab culture, often its leading edge; Arabic poetry was revived in the twentieth century by poets who actually lived in New York or Latin America.Perhaps it will be the same here.It is surprising to find how much their vision of history corresponds to what Boone believed; I dont think either understood that at all.Very few people ever bother to find out what other people really think.They are willing to accept whatever they are told about anyone sufficiently distant.He came on a find of porphyry copper, unusually dense, and with high concentrations of silver in it as well.That would be welcome.Copper and silver were both only somewhat scarce metals on Earth, but silver was used in massive quantities in a great number of industries, and they were running low on easy sources of it.And here was more of it, right on the surface, in good concentrations; not as much as in Silver Mountain on the Elysium massif, of course, but the Arabs would not care.Harvest it, and then they would get to move again.He moved on himself.Days passed, the shadows wheeled.The wind went downslope, upslope, downslope, upslope.Clouds formed and storms broke, and sometimes the sky was spangled with icebows and sundogs and dust devils made of hail, sparkling like mica in the pink sunlight.Sometimes he would see one of the aerobraking continuous shuttles, like a blazing meteor running steadily across the sky.One clear morning he saw Elysium Montes, bulking over the horizon like a black Himalaya; the view had been bent a thousand kilometers over the horizon by an inversion layer in the atmosphere.He stopped turning on the lectern as he had the TV.Nothing but the world and him.Winds caught at the sand, and tossed clouds of it against the rover.Khla, the empty land.But then dreams began to plague him, dreams that were memories, intense and full and accurate, as if he were reliving his past while he slept.One night he dreamed of the day he had found out for sure that he would lead the American half of the first Martian colony.He had driven from Washington out to the Shenandoah Valley, feeling very odd.He walked for a long time in the great Eastern hardwood forest.He came on the limestone caves at Luray, a tourist attraction, and on a whim he took the tour.Every stalactite and stalagmite was lit by lurid colored lights.Some had had mallets attached to them, and an organist could play them like the plates of a glockenspiel; the well tempered cavern!He had to walk out into the peripheral blackness and stuff his sleeve in his mouth so the other tourists wouldnt hear him laugh.Then he parked in a scenic overlook and walked off into the forest, and sat down between the roots of a big tree.No one around, a warm fall night, the earth dark, and furry with trees.Cicadas cycling through their alien hum, crickets creaking their last mournful creaks, sensing the frost that would kill them.He felt so odd could he really leave this world behind?Sitting there on the earth he had wished he could slide down a crack like a changeling and reemerge something else, something better, something mighty, noble, long lived something like a tree.But nothing happened, of course; he lay on the ground, cut off from it already.A Martian already.And he woke, and was disturbed all the rest of that day.And then, even worse, he dreamed of John.He dreamed of the night he had sat in Washington and watched John on TV, stepping out onto Mars for the first time, closely followed by the other three.Frank left the official celebration at NASA and walked the streets, a hot D. C.  night, summer of 2020.It had been part of his plan for John to make the first landing, he had given it to him as one sacrifices a queen in chess, because that first crew would be fried by the voyages radiation, and according to the regs grounded for good on their return.And then the field would be cleared for the next trip out, for the colonists who would stay for good.That was the real game, and that was the one Frank planned to lead.Still, on that historic night he found himself in a foul mood.He went back to his apartment near Dupont Circle and then went out and lost his FBI tag and slipped into a dark bar and sat there watching the TV over the bartenders heads, drinking bourbon like his father, with Martian light pouring out of the TV and reddening the whole dark room.And as he got drunk and listened to Johns inane talk his mood got worse and worse.It was hard to focus on his plan.He drank hard.The bar was noisy, the crowd inattentive; not that the landing hadnt been noticed, but here it was just another entertainment, on a par with the Bullets game that one bartender kept cutting to.Then blip, back to the scene on Chryse Planitia.The man next to him swore at the switch.Basketballs gonna be a hell of a game on Mars, Frank said in the Florida accent he had long ago eradicated.Have to move the hoop up, or they be breaking their heads.Sure, but think of the jumps.Twenty foot dunks easy.Yeah even you white boysll jump high there, or so you say.But you better leave the basket alone, or you got the same trouble you got here.Frank laughed.But outside it was hot, a muggy D. C.  summer night, and he walked home in a plummeting foul mood, blacker and blacker with every step; and coming upon one of Duponts beggars, he pulled out a ten dollar bill and threw it at the man, and as the bum reached for it Frank shoved him away shouting Fuck you!Get a job!But then people came up out of the Metro and he hurried off, shocked and furious.Beggars slumped in the doorways.There were people on Mars and there were beggars in the streets of the nations capital, and all the lawyers walked by them every day, their freedom and justice talk no more than a cover for their greed.Were gonna do it different on Mars, Frank said viciously, and all of a sudden he wanted to be there immediately, no careful years of waiting, of campaigningGet a fucking job!he shouted at another homeless man.Then on to his apartment building, with its bored security team behind the foyer desk, people wasting their whole lives sitting there doing nothing.Upstairs his hands shook so hard that he couldnt at first get his door open and once inside he stood frozen, horrified at the sight of all the bland executives furniture, all of it a theater set, built to impress infrequent visitors, really just NASA and the FBI.None of it his.Nothing his.Nothing but a plan.And then he woke up, alone, in a rover on the Great Escarpment.Eventually he returned from this awful expedition of dreams.Back in the caravan he found it hard to talk.He was invited to Zeyks for coffee, and he swallowed a tablet of an opiate complex to relax himself in the company of men.In Zeyks rover he sat in his spot, and waited for Zeyk to pass around little cups of clove dosed coffee.Unsi Al Khal sat on his left, speaking at length about the Islam vision of history, and how it had begun in the Jahili or pre Islam period.Al Khal had never been friendly, and when Frank tried to pass him the cup that came his way in a standard gesture of politeness, Al Khal curtly insisted that the honor was Franks, that Al Khal would not be prevailed upon to usurp it.Typical insult by over politeness, the hierarchy again one could not do favors for one higher in the system, favors only went downward.Alpha males, pecking orders; really they might as well have been back on the savannah (or in Washington), it was nothing more than primate dominance tactics again.Frank ground his teeth, and when Al Khal began pontificating again he said, What about your women?They were taken aback, and Al Khal shrugged.In Islam men and women have different roles.Just as in the West.It is biological in origin.Frank shook his head and felt the sensuous buzz of the tabs, the black weight of the past.The pressure on a permanent aquifer of disgust at the bottom of his thinking increased, and something gave, and suddenly he didnt care about anything and was sick of pretending he did.Sick of all pretense everywhere, the glutinous oil that allowed society to run on in its gnashing horrid way.Yes, he said, but its slavery, isnt it?The men around him stiffened, shocked by the word.Isnt it?he said, helplessly feeling the words bubble up out of his throat.Your wives and daughters are powerless, and that is slavery.You may keep them well, and they may be slaves with peculiar and intimate powers over their masters, but the master slave relationship twists everything to it.So that all these relations are twisted, pressured to the bursting point.Zeyks nose was wrinkled.This is not the lived experience of it, I can assure you.You should listen to our poetry.But would your women assure me?Yes, Zeyk said with perfect confidence.Maybe.But look, the most successful women among you are modest and deferent at all times, they are scrupulous in honoring the system.Those are the ones that aid their husbands and sons to rise in the system.So to succeed, they must work to enforce the same system that subjugates them.This is poisonous in its effects.And the cycle repeats itself, generation after generation.Supported by both masters and slaves.The use of the word slaves, Al Khal said slowly, and paused.Is offensive, because it presumes judgment.Judgment of a culture you do not really know.True.I only tell you what it looks like from the outside.This can only be of interest to a progressive Moslem.Is this the divine pattern you are struggling to actualize in history?The laws are there to read, and to watch in action, and to me it looks like a form of slavery.And, you know, we fought wars to end slavery.And we excluded South Africa from the community of nations for arranging its laws so that the blacks could never live as well as the whites.But you do this all the time.If any men in the world were treated like you treat your women, the U. N.  would ostracize that nation.But because it is a matter of women, the men in power look away.They say it is a cultural matter, a religious matter, not to be interfered with.Or it is not called slavery because it is only an exaggeration of how women are treated elsewhere.Or not even an exaggeration, Zeyk suggested.A variation.No, it is an exaggeration.Western women choose much of what they do, they have their lives to live.Not so among you.But no human submits to being property, they hate it, and subvert it, and have what revenge they can against it.Thats how humans are.And in this case it is your mother, your wife, your sisters, your daughters.Now the men were glaring at him, still more shocked than offended; but Frank stared at his coffee cup, and went on regardless.You must free your women.How do you suggest we do this?Zeyk said, looking at him curiously.Change your laws!Educate them in the same schools your sons go to.Make them the equal in rights to any Moslem of any kind anywhere.Remember, there is much in your laws that is not in the Koran, but was added in the time since Mohammed.Added by holy men, Al Khal said angrily.Certainly.But we choose the ways we enforce our religious beliefs in the behavior of daily life.This is true of all cultures.And we can choose new ways.You must free your women.I do not like to be given a sermon by anyone but a mullah, Al Khal said, mouth tight under his moustache.Let those who are innocent of crime preach what is right.Zeyk smiled cheerily.This is what Selim el Hayil used to say, he said.And there was a deep, charged silence.Frank blinked.Many of the men were smiling now, looking at Zeyk with appreciation.And it came to Frank in a flash that they all knew what had happened in Nicosia.Of course!Selim had died that night just hours after the assassination, poisoned by a strange combination of microbes; but they knew anyway.And yet they had accepted him, taken him into their homes, into their private enclosures where they lived their private lives.They had tried to teach him what they believed.Perhaps we should make them as free as Russian women, Zeyk said with a laugh, extricating Frank from the moment.Crazed by overwork, dont they say?Told they are equal, but actually not?Yussuf Hawi, a high spirited young man, leered and cackled: Bitches, I can tell you!But no more or less than any other woman!Isnt it true that in the home the power always goes to the strong?In my rover I am the slave, I can tell you that.I kiss snakes butt daily with my Aziza!The men roared with laughter at him.Zeyk took their cups, and poured another round of coffee.The men patched up the conversation as best they could; they covered for Franks gross assault, either because it was so far beyond the pale that it only indicated ignorance, or because they wanted to acknowledge and support Zeyks sponsorship of him.But only about half of them looked at Frank anymore.He withdrew and listened again, profoundly angry at himself.It was a mistake to speak ones mind at any time, unless it perfectly matched your political purpose; and it never did.Best to strip all statements of real content, this was a basic law of diplomacy.Out on the escarpment he had forgotten that.Disturbed, he went out in a prospector again.The dreams became less frequent.When he came back in, he did not take any drugs.He sat silently in the coffee circles, or spoke about minerals and groundwater, or the comfort of the newly modified prospecting rovers.The men regarded him cautiously, and only included him in the conversation again because of Zeyks friendliness, which never flagged except for that one moment, when he had most effectively reminded Frank of one of the basic facts of the situation.One night Zeyk invited him over for a private dinner with him and his wife Nazik.Nazik wore a long white dress cut in the traditional Bedouin style, with a blue waistband and bare headed, her thick black hair drawn back into a flat comb and then left to fall down her back.Frank had read enough to know that this was all wrong; among the Bedouin of the Awlad Ali, women wore black dresses and red sashes, to indicate their impurity, sexuality, and moral inferiority, and they kept their heads covered, and used the veil in an elaborate hierarchical code of modesty.All in deference to male power, so that Naziks clothes would be deeply shocking to her mother and grandmothers, even if she was, as now, wearing them before an outsider who didnt really matter.But if he knew enough to understand, then it was a sign.And then at one point, when they were all laughing, Nazik rose at Zeyks request to get them dessert, and she said to Zeyk with a laugh, Yes, master.Zeyk scowled and said, Go, slave, and took a swipe at her, and she snapped her teeth at him.They laughed at Franks fierce blush, and saw that he understood: they were mocking him, and also breaking the Bedouin taboo against showing marital affection of any kind, to anyone.Nazik came over and put her fingertip on his shoulder, which shocked him further.We are only joking with you, you know, she said.We women heard about your declaration to the men, and we love you for it.You could have as many wives among us as an Ottoman sultan.Because there is some truth to what you said, too much.She nodded seriously, and pointed a finger at Zeyk, who wiped the grin from his face and nodded as well.Nazik went on: But so much depends on the people within the laws, dont you find?The men in this caravan are good men, smart men.And the women are even smarter, and we have taken over entirely.Zeyks eyebrows shot up, and Nazik laughed.No, really, we have only taken our share.Seriously.But where are you, then?Frank said.I mean where are the caravans women, during the day?What do you do?We work, Nazik said simply.Take a look, youll see us.Doing all the kinds of work?Oh yes.Perhaps not where you can see us much.There are still some habits, customs.We are reclusive, separate, we have our own world it is perhaps not good.We Bedu tend to group together, men and women.We have our traditions, you see, and they endure.But there is much that is changing here, changing fast.So that this is the next stage of the Islamic way.We are ...She searched for the word.Utopia, Zeyk suggested.The Moslem utopia.She waggled a hand doubtfully.History, she said.The hadj to utopia.Zeyk laughed with pleasure.But the hadj is the destination, he said.That is what the mullahs always teach us.So we are already there, no?And he and his wife smiled at each other, a private communication with a high density of information exchange, a smile which they shared, for a moment, with Frank.And their talk veered elsewhere.In practical terms Al Qahira was the pan Arab dream come alive, as all the Arab nations had contributed money and people to the Mahjaris.The mix of Arab nationalities on Mars was complete, but in the individual caravans it separated out a bit.Still, they mixed; and whether they came from the oil rich nations or the oil poor ones didnt seem to matter.Here among the foreigners they were all cousins.Syrians and Iraqis, Egyptians and Saudis, Gulf Staters and Palestinians, Libyans and Bedouins.All cousins here.Frank began to feel better.He slept deeply again, refreshed by the timeslip in every day, a little slack in the circadian rhythm, the bodys own time off.Indeed all life in the caravan had an altered duration, as if the moment itself had dilated; he felt there was time to spare, that there was never a reason to hurry.And the seasons rolled by.The sun set in almost the same spot every night, shifting ever so slowly; they lived entirely by the Martian calendar now, it was the only new year they noticed or celebrated: Ls = 0, the start of northern spring, of the year 16.Season after season, each six months long, and each passing in the absence of the old sharp sense of mortality: it was like living in the eternal now, in an endless round of works and days, in the continuous cycle of prayer to the oh so distant Mecca, in the ceaseless wandering over the land.In the always cold.One morning they woke to find it had snowed in the night, and the whole landscape was pure white.And mostly water ice.The whole caravan went crazy for the day, all of them, men and women, outside in walkers, giddy at the sight, kicking snow, making snowballs that did not cohere satisfactorily, trying to pile snowmen that likewise did not stick together.The snow was too cold.Zeyk laughed hard at these efforts.What an albedo, he said.Its astonishing how much of what Sax does rebounds against him.Feedbacks naturally adjust toward homeostasis, dont you think?I wonder if Sax shouldnt have first made things so much colder that the whole atmosphere froze out onto the surface.How thick would it be, a centimeter?Then line up our harvesters pole to pole, and run them around the world like latitude lines, processing the carbon dioxide into good air and fertilizer.Ha, cant you see it?Frank shook his head.Sax probably considered it, and rejected it for some reason we dont see.No doubt.The snow sublimed away, the red land returned, they traveled on their way.Occasionally they passed nuclear reactors, standing like castles on the top of the escarpment not just Rickovers but giant Westinghouse breeders, with frost plumes like thunderheads.On Mangalavid they saw programs about a fusion prototype in Chasma Borealis.Canyon after canyon.They knew the land in a way that even Ann didnt; every part of Mars interested her equally, so she could not have this focused knowledge of a single region, this way they had of reading it like a story, following its leads through the red rock to a patch of blackish sulfides, or the delicate cinnabar of mercury deposits.They were not so much students of the land as lovers of it; they wanted something from it.Ann, on the other hand, asked for nothing but questions to be asked.There were so many different kinds of desire.Days passed, and then more seasons.When they ran into other Arab caravans they celebrated long into the night, with music and dance, coffee and hookahs and talk, in meeting tents covering an octagon of parked rovers.Their music was never recorded, but played with great facility on flutes and electric guitars, and mostly sung, in quarter tones and wails so strange to Franks ear that for a long time he couldnt tell if the singers were accomplished or not.The meals lasted hours, and afterward they talked till dawn, and made a point of going out to watch the furnace blast of sunrise.When they met with other nationalities, however, they were naturally more reserved.Once they passed a new Amex mining station manned mostly by Americans, perched on one of the rare big veins of mafic rock rich in platinoids, in Tantalus Fossae near Alba Patera.The mine itself was down on the long flat floor of the narrow rift canyon, but it was mostly robotic, and the crew lived up in a plush tent, on the rim overlooking the rift.The Arabs circled next to this tent, made a brief guarded visit inside, and retreated into their insectile rovers for the night.It would have been impossible for the Americans to learn a thing about them.But that evening Frank went back over into the Amex tent by himself.The folks inside were from Florida, and their voices brought up memories in him like nets filled with coelacanths; Frank ignored all the little mental explosions, and asked question after question, concentrating on the black and Latino and redneck faces that answered him.He saw that this group was imitating an earlier form of community just like the Arabs did this was a wildcat oil field crew, enduring harsh conditions and long hours for big paychecks, all saved for the return to civilization.It was worth it even if Mars sucked, which it did.I mean even on the Ice you can go outside, but here, fuck.They didnt care who Frank was, and as he sat among them listening they told stories to each other that astonished him even though they were somehow deeply familiar.There was twenty two of us prospecting with this little mobile habitat with no rooms to it, and one night we got to partying and took all our clothes off, and all the women got in a circle on the floor with their heads in the middle, and the guys went in a circle around the outside, and there were twelve guys and ten gals so the two guys out kept the rotation going pretty fast, and we actually got all the way around the circle in the timeslip.We tried to all come at once at the end of the timeslip and it worked pretty good, once a few couples got going it was like a whirlpool and it sucked everyone down into it.Felt so good.And then, after the laughter and the shouts of disbelief: We was killing and freezing these hogs in Acidalia, and those humane killers are like shooting a giant arrow into their heads so we figured why not kill and freeze them both at once and see what happens.So we got them all handicapped, and bet on which ones would get the furthest, and we open the outer lock door and those pigs all dash out outside and wham, they all keeled over inside of fifty yards of the door, except for one little gal that got almost two hundred yards, and froze standing upright.I win a thousand dollar on that hog.Frank grinned at their howls.He was back in America.He asked them what else they had done on Mars.Some had been building nuclear reactors up on top of Pavonis Mons, where the space elevator would touch down.Others had worked on the water pipe running up eastern Tharsis Bulge from Noctis to Pavonis.The parent transnational for the elevator, Praxis, had a lot of interests at the bottom end, as they called it.I worked on a Westinghouse on top of the Compton aquifer under Noctis, which is supposed to have as much water in it as the Mediterranean, and this reactors entire job was going to be to power a bunch of humidifiers.Fucking two hundred megawatts of humidifier, theyre the same as the humidifier I had in my bedroom when I was a kid, except they take fifty kilowatts apiece!Gigantic Rockwell monsters with single molecule vaporizers and jet turbine engines that shoot the mist out of thousand meter stacks.Fucking unbelievable.A million liters a day of H and O added to the air.Another of them had been building a new tent city in the Echus channel, below Overlook: Theyve apped an aquifer there and theres fountains all over town, statues in the fountains, waterfalls, canals, ponds, swimming pools, you name it, its a little Venice up there.Great thermal retention too.The conversation removed itself to the gym, which was well stocked with machines designed to enable their users to stay Earth ready.Hes buffed, look at that, must be short time.Almost everyone kept to a rigorous workout schedule, three hours a day minimum.If you give up youre stuck here, right?And then what good is that savings account?Eventually itll be legal tender, another one of them said.Where people go, the American dollar is sure to follow.You got it backwards, assbite.As we are the proof of.Frank said, I thought the treaty blocked the use of Terran money here?The treatys a fucking joke, said one doing lat pulls.Dead as Bessy the Long Distance Hog.They stared at Frank, all of them in their twenties and thirties, a generation he had never talked to much; he didnt know how they had grown up, what had shaped them, what they might believe.The oh so familiar accents and faces might be deceptive, in fact probably were.You think so?he asked.Some of them seemed more aware than the rest that he might be connected to the treaty, along with all his other historical associations.But the man doing lat pulls was oblivious.Were here on a deal that the treaty says is illegal, man.And its happening all over.Brazil, Georgia, the Gulf States, all the countries that voted against the treaty are letting the transnats in.Its a contest among the flags of convenience as to how convenient they can be!And UNOMA is flat on its back with its legs spread, saying More, more.Folks are landing by the thousands and most are employed by transnats, theyve got their government visas and five year contracts, including rehab time to get you Earth buffed, things like that.By the thousands?Frank said.Oh yeah!By the tens of thousands!He hadnt looked at TV, he realized, for...for a long time.A man doing military presses spoke between lifts of the whole stack of black weights.Its gonna blow pretty soon a lot of people dont like it not just old timers like you a whole bunch of new timers, too theyre disappearing in droves whole operations whole towns sometimes came on a mine in Syrtis completely empty everything useful gone completely stripped even stuff like lock doors oxygen tanks toilets stuff thatd take hours to pull loose.Why did they do that?Going native!a bench presser exclaimed.Won over by your comrade Arkady Bogdanov!From flat on his back this man met Franks gaze; a tall, broad shouldered black man with an aquiline nose.He said, They get up here and the company tries to look good, gyms and good food and rec time and all, but what it comes down to is them telling you everything you can do and cant do.Its all scheduled, when you wake up, when you eat, when you shit, its like the Navy has taken over Club Med, you know?And then here comes your bro Arkady, saying to us, Youre Amurricans, boys, you got to be free, this Mars is the new frontier, and you should know some of us are treating it that way, we aint no robot software, were free men, making our own rules on our own world!And thats it, man!The room crackled with laughter, everyone had stopped to listen: That does the trick!Folks get up here and they see theyre schedule software, they see they cant keep Earth buffed without they spend their whole time in here sucking the air hose, and even then I spect its impossible, they lied to us Ill bet.So the pay means nothing, really, were all software and maybe stuck here for good.Slaves, man!Fucking slaves!And believe you me, thats pissing a lot of folk off.Theyre ready to strike back, I mean to tell you.And thats the folks who are disappearing.Gonna be a whole lot of them before its all over.Frank stared down at the man.Why havent you disappeared?The man laughed shortly and began pumping weights again.Security, someone else called from the Nautilus machine.Military Press disagreed.Securitys lame but you got to have somewhere to go.Soon as Arkady shows gone!One time, Bench Press said, I saw a vid of him where he talked about how folk of color are better suited for Mars than white folk, how we do better with the UV.Yeah!Yeah!They were all laughing at that, both skeptical and amused at once.Its bullshit, but what the hell, Bench Press said.Why not?Why not?Call it our world.Call it Nova Africa.Say no boss is gonna take it away from us this time.He was laughing again, as if everything he had said was no more than a funny idea.Or else a hilarious truth, a truth so delicious that just saying it made you laugh out loud.And so very late that night Frank went back to the Arab rovers, and he continued on with them, but it wasnt the same.He had been yanked back into time, and now the long days in the prospector only made him itch.He watched TV; he made some calls.He had never resigned as Secretary the office had been run in his absence by Assistant Secretary Slusinski and the staff, and he had done just enough by phone for them to cover for him, telling Washington that he was working, then that he was doing deep research, then that he was taking a working vacation, and that as one of the first hundred he needed to be out there wandering around.It wouldnt have lasted much longer, but when Frank called Washington directly the President was pleased, and in Burroughs the exhausted looking Slusinski looked happy indeed.In fact the whole Burroughs office sounded pleased that he planned to come back, which surprised Frank quite a bit.When he had left Burroughs, disgusted at the treaty and depressed about Maya, he had been, he thought, a bastard of a boss.But here they had covered for him for almost two years, and seemed happy to hear he was coming back.People were strange.The aura of the first hundred, no doubt.As if that mattered.So Frank returned from his final prospecting trip and sat that evening in Zeyks rover, sipping his coffee, watching them talk, Zeyk and Al Khan and Yussuf and the rest, and, wandering in and out of the room, Nazik and Aziza.People who had accepted him; people who in some sense understood him.By their code he had done the necessary things.He relaxed in the flow of Arabic, still and always awash with ambiguity: lily, river, forest, lark, jasmine, words that might refer to a waldo hand, a pipe, a kind of talus, robot parts; or perhaps just to lily, river, forest, lark, jasmine.A beautiful, beautiful language.The speech of the people who had taken him in, and let him rest.But he would have to leave.They had arranged things so that if you spent half the year in Underhill you were assigned a permanent room of your own.Towns all over the planet were adopting similar systems, because people were moving around so much that no one felt at home anywhere, and this arrangement seemed to mitigate that.Certainly the first hundred, who were among the most mobile Martians of all, had started spending more time in Underhill than they had in the years before, and this was mostly a pleasure, to most of them.At any given time twenty or thirty would be around, and others came in and stayed for a while between jobs, and in the constant come and go they had a chance to carry on a more or less continuous conference on the state of things, with newcomers reporting what they had seen firsthand, and the rest arguing about what it meant.Frank, however, did not spend the required twelve months a year in Underhill, and so he did not have a room there.He had moved the departments head offices to Burroughs back in 2050, and before joining the Arabs in 57 the only room he had kept was there in the offices.Now it was 59 and he was back, in a room one floor down from his old one.Dropping his bag on the floor and looking around at the room, he cursed aloud.To have to be in Burroughs in person as if ones physical presence made any difference these days!It was an absurd anachronism, but thats the way people were.Another vestige of the savannah.They lived like monkeys still, while their new god powers lay around them in the weeds.Slusinski came in.Though his accent was pure New York, Frank had always called him Jeeves, because he looked like the actor in the BBC series.Were like dwarves in a waldo, Frank said to him angrily.One of those really big waldo excavators.Were inside it and supposed to be moving a mountain, and instead of using the waldo capabilities were leaning out of a window and digging with teaspoons.And complimenting each other on the way were taking advantage of the height.I see, Jeeves said carefully.But there was nothing to be done about it.He was back in Burroughs, hurrying around, four meetings an hour, conferences that told him what he already knew, which was that UNOMA was now using the treaty for toilet paper.They were approving accounting systems which guaranteed that mining would never show any profits to distribute to the General Assembly members, even after the elevator was working.They were handing out necessary personnel status to thousands of emigrants.They were ignoring the various local groups, ignoring MarsFirst.Most of this was done in the name of the elevator itself, which provided an endless string of excuses, 35,000 kilometers of excuses, 120 billion dollars of excuses.Which was not all that expensive, actually, compared to the military budgets of the past century.And most of the elevator funds had been needed in the first years of finding the asteroid and getting it into proper orbit, and setting up the cable factory.After that the factory ate the asteroid and spit out the cable, and that was that; they only had to wait for it to grow long enough, and nudge it down into position.A bargain, a real bargain!And also a great excuse for breaking the treaty whenever it seemed expedient.God damn it, Frank shouted at the end of a long day in the first week back.Why has UNOMA caved like this?Jeeves and the rest of his staff took this as a rhetorical question and offered no theories.He had definitely been away too long; they were afraid of him now.He had to answer the question himself: Its greed I guess, theyre all getting paid off in one cosmeticized way or another.At dinner that night, in a little caf, he ran into Janet Blyleven and Ursula Kohl and Vlad Taneev.As they ate they watched the news from Earth on a bar TV.Really it had gotten to be almost too much to watch.Canada and Norway were joining the plan to enforce population growth slowdown.No one would say population control, of course, it was a forbidden phrase in politics, but thats what it was in fact, and it was turning into the tragedy of the commons all over again: if one country ignored the U. N.  resolutions, then nearby countries were howling for fear of being overwhelmed.Another monkey fear, but there it was.Meanwhile Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Azania, the United States, Canada, and Switzerland had all proclaimed immigration illegal, while India was growing by 8 percent a year.Famine would solve that, as it would in a lot of countries.The Four Horsemen were good at population control.Until then...The TV cut to an ad for a popular diet fat, which was indigestible and went right through the gut unchanged.Eat all you want!Janet clicked off the TV.Lets change the subject.They sat around their table and stared at their plates.It turned out Vlad and Ursula had come from Acheron because there was an outbreak of resistant tuberculosis in Elysium.The cordon sanitaire has fallen apart, Ursula said.Some of the emigrant viruses will surely mutate, or combine with one of our tailored systems.Earth again.It was impossible to avoid it.Things are falling apart down there!Janet said.Its been coming for years, Frank said harshly, his tongue loosened by the faces of his old friends.Even before the treatment life expectancy in the rich countries was nearly double that in the poor.Think about that!But in the old days the poor were so poor they hardly knew what life expectancy was, the day itself was their whole concern.Now every corner shop has a TV and they can see whats happening that theyve got AIDS while the rich have the treatment.Its gone way beyond a difference in degree, I mean they die young and the rich live forever!So why should they hold back?Theyve got nothing to lose.And everything to gain, Vlad said.They could live like us.They huddled over cups of coffee.The room was dim.The pine furniture had a dark patina; stains, nicks, fines rubbed in by hand....It could have been one of those nights in that distant time when they were the only ones in the world, a few of them up later than the rest, talking.Except Frank blinked and looked around, and saw in his friends faces the weariness, the white hair, the turtle faces of the old.Time had passed, they were scattered over the planet, running like he was, or hidden like Hiroko, or dead like John.Johns absence suddenly seemed huge and gaping, a crater on whose rim they huddled glumly, trying to warm their hands.Frank shuddered.Later Vlad and Ursula went to bed.Frank looked at Janet, feeling immobilized as he sometimes did at the end of a long day, incapable of ever moving again.Wheres Maya these days?he asked, to keep Janet from retiring too.She and Maya had been good friends in the Hellas years.Oh, shes here in Burroughs, Janet said.Didnt you know?No.Shes got Samanthas old rooms.She may be avoiding you.What?Shes pretty mad at you.Mad at me?Sure.She regarded him across the dim, faintly humming room.You must have known that.While he was still considering how open to be with her, he said, No!Why should she be?Oh Frank, she said.She leaned forward in her chair.Quit acting like youve got a stick up your ass!We know you, we were there, we saw it all happen!And as he was recoiling she leaned back, and said calmly, You must know that Maya loves you.She always has.Me?he said weakly.Its John she loved.Yeah, sure.But John was easy.He loved her back, and it was glamorous.It was too easy for Maya.She likes things hard.And thats you.He shook his head.I dont think so.Janet laughed at him.I know Im right, shes told me as much!Ever since the treaty conference shes been angry at you, and she always talks when shes mad.But why is she angry?Because you rejected her!Rejected her, after pursuing her for years and years, and she got used to that, she loved it.It was romantic, the way you persisted.She took it for granted, sure, but she loved you for it.And she liked how powerful you were.And now John is dead, and she could finally say yes to you, and you sent her packing.She was furious!And she stays mad a long time.This ...Frank struggled to collect himself.It just doesnt match with my understanding of whats happened.Janet stood up to go, and as she walked by him she patted him on the head.Maybe you ought to talk to Maya about it then.She left.For a long time he sat there, feeling stunned, examining the shiny grain of his chair arm.It was hard to think.Eventually he stopped trying and went to bed.He slept poorly, and at the end of a long night he had another dream about John.They were in the long drafty upcurved chambers of the space station, spinning at Martian gravity, in their long stay of 2010, six weeks together up there, young and strong, John saying I feel like Superman, this gravitys great, I feel like Superman!Running laps around the big ring of the station hallway.Everythings going to change on Mars, Frank.Everything!No.Each step was like the last jump of a triple jump.Boing, boing, boing, boing.Yes!The whole question will be learning to run fast enough.A perfect interference pattern of cloud dots lay pasted over the western coast of Madagascar.The sun bronzing the ocean below.Everything looks so fine from up here.Get any closer and you begin to see too much, Frank murmured.Or not enough.It was cold, they argued over the temperature, John was from Minnesota and had slept as a boy with his window open.So Frank shivered, a down coverlet draped over his shoulders, his feet blocks of ice.They played chess and Frank won.John laughed.How stupid, he said.What do you mean?Games dont mean anything.Are you sure?Sometimes life seems like a kind of game to me.John shook his head.In games there are rules, but in life the rules keep changing.You could put your bishop out there to mate the other guys king, and he could lean down and whisper in your bishops ear, and suddenly its playing for him, and moving like a rook.And youre fucked.Frank nodded.He had taught these things to John.A confusion of meals, chess, talk, the view of the rolling Earth.It felt like the only life they had ever lived.The voices from Houston were like AIs, their concerns absurd.The planet itself was so beautiful, so intricately patterned by its land and its clouds.I never want to go down.I mean this is almost better than Marsll be, dont you think?No.Huddled, shivering, listening to John talk of boyhood.Girls, sports, dreams of space.Frank responded with tales of Washington, lessons from Machiavelli, until it occurred to him that John was formidable enough as it was.Friendship was just diplomacy by other means, after all.But later, after a vague blur...talking, halting, shivering, talking about his father, coming home drunk from the Jacksonville bars, Priscilla and her white blond hair, her fashion magazine face.How it meant nothing to him anymore, a marriage for the resum, for looking normal to the shrinks without holding him down.And not his fault.Abandoned, after all.Betrayed.That sounds bad.No wonder you think people are so fucked.Frank waved at their big blue lamp.But they are.Waving by coincidence at the Horn of Africa.Think about whats happened down there.Thats history, Frank.We can do better than that.Can we?Can we?You just wait and see.He woke up, his stomach knotted, his skin sweaty.He got up and took a shower already he could remember no more than a single fragment of the dream: John, saying Wait and see.But his stomach was like wood.After breakfast he clicked his fork on the table, thinking.All that day he spent distracted, wandering as if still in a dream, wondering from time to time how one told the difference.Wasnt this life dreamlike in every significant respect?Everything overlit, bizarre, symbolic of something else?That evening he went looking for Maya, feeling helpless, in the grip of a compulsion.The decision had been made the night before, when Janet said, She loves you, you know.And he turned a corner to the dining commons and there she was, her head thrown back in the middle of her pealing laugh, vividly Maya, her hair as white as it had once been black, her eyes fixed on her companion; a man, dark haired, handsome, perhaps in his fifties, smiling at her.Maya put a hand to his upper arm, a characteristic gesture, one of her usual intimacies, it meant nothing and in fact indicated that he was not her lover but rather someone she was in the process of enchanting; they could have met just minutes before, although the look on his face indicated he knew her better than that.She turned and saw Frank, blinked with surprise.She looked back at the man and continued to speak, in Russian, her hand still on his arm.Frank hesitated and almost turned and left.Silently he cursed himself was he no more than a schoolboy, then?He walked by them and said hello, did not hear if they replied.All through the dinner she stayed glued to the mans side, not looking his way, not coming over.The man, pleasant enough looking, was surprised at her attention, surprised but pleased.Clearly they would leave together, clearly they would spend the night together.That foreknowledge always made people pleasant.She would use people like that without a qualm, the bitch.Love....The more he thought about it the angrier he got.She had never loved anyone but herself.And yet...that look on her face when she first saw him; for a split second hadnt she been pleased, and then wanted him angry at her?And wasnt that a sign of hurt feelings, of a desire to hurt back, meaning a certain (incredibly childish) desire for him?Well, the hell with her.He went back to his room and packed his bag, and took the subway to the train station, and got on a night train west, up Tharsis to Pavonis Mons.In a few months time, when the elevator was maneuvered into its remarkable orbit, Pavonis Mons was going to become the hub of Mars, superceding Burroughs as Burroughs had once superseded Underhill.And as the elevators touchdown was not far off, signs of the areas coming predominance were already everywhere.Paralleling the train piste as it ascended the steep eastern slope of the volcano were two new roads and four thick pipelines, as well as an array of cables, a line of microwave towers, and a continuous litter of stations, loading tracks, warehouses, and dumps.And then, on the last and steepest upcurve of the volcanos cone, there was a vast congregation of tents and industrial buildings, thicker and thicker until up on the broad rim they were everywhere, and between them immense fields of insolation capture sheets, and receivers for the energy microwaved down from the orbiting solar panels.Each tent along the way was a little town, stuffed with little apartment blocks, and each apartment block was stuffed with people, their laundry hanging from every window.The tents nearest the piste had very few trees in them, and looked like commercial districts.Frank caught quick glimpses of food stands, video rentals, open front gyms, clothing stores, laundromats.Litter piled in the streets.Then he was into the train station on the rim, and out of the train and into the spacious tent of the station.The south rim had a tremendous view over the great caldera, an immense, nearly circular hole, flawless except for a single giant scoop bursting out of the rim to the northeast.This scoop formed a great gap across the caldera from the station, the mark of a truly huge sideways explosion.But that was the only flaw in the design; otherwise the cliff was regular, and the floor of the caldera was almost perfectly round, almost perfectly flat.And sixty kilometers across, and a full 5,000 meters deep.Like the start of the mohole to end all moholes.The few signs of human presence on the caldera floor were on an ants scale, almost invisible from the rim.The equator ran right across the southern rim, and that was where they were going to secure the lower end of the elevator.The attachment point was obvious; it was a massive tan and white concrete blockhouse, located a few kilometers east of the big tent town around the train station.Running east along the rim beyond the blockhouse was a line of factories and earthmovers and cones of feedstock materials, all gleaming with photographic clarity in the clear dustless thin high air, under a sky that was a kind of plum black.There were a number of stars near the zenith that were visible by day.The day after his arrival, the staff of the local department office took him out to the elevator base.Apparently technicians were going to capture the leader line from the cable that afternoon.This turned out to be unspectacular, but it was a peculiar sight nevertheless.The end of the leader line was marked by a small guidance rocket, and this rockets eastern facing jets flared continuously, while the north and south jets added occasional spurts.The rocket thus descended slowly into the grasp of a gantry, looking like any other landing vehicle, except that there was a silver line extending up from it, a straight fine line that was only visible for a couple thousand meters above the rocket.Looking at it Frank felt as if he were standing on a sea floor and observing a fishing line, dropped down among them from the plum sea surface a fishing line tied to a bright colorful lure, in the process of snagging on a bottom wreck.His blood burned in his throat, and he had to look down and breathe deep.Very peculiar.They toured the base complex.The gantry that had captured the leader line was located inside a big hole in the concrete block, a concrete crater with a thick ring of a rim.The walls of this concrete crater were studded by curved silver columns, which held magnetic coils that would fix the cable butt in a shock cushioning collar.The cable would float well off the concrete floor of the chamber, suspended there by the pull of the outer half of the cable; an exquisitely balanced orbit, an object extending from a moonlet down into this room, 37,000 kilometers in all.And only ten meters across.With the leader line secured, the cable itself could be guided down fairly easily, but not rapidly, as it had to drift down into its final orbit very gently indeed, in an asymptotic approach.Its going to be like Zenos paradox, Slusinski said.So it was many days after that visit when the butt of the cable finally appeared in the sky, and hung there.Over the next few weeks it descended ever more slowly, always there in their sky.A very odd sight indeed; it gave Frank a touch of vertigo, and every time he saw it the image of standing on an ocean floor returned to him.They were looking up at a fishing line, a black thread hanging down from the plum sea surface.Frank spent this time setting up the head Department of Mars offices in the town, which one day was christened Sheffield.The Burroughs staff protested the move, but he ignored them.He spent his time meeting with American executives and project managers, all at work on various aspects of the elevator or Sheffield, or the outlying Pavonis towns.Americans represented only a fraction of the workforce on hand, but Chalmers was kept busy nevertheless, because the overall project was so huge.And Americans appeared to be dominating the superconducting, and the software involved with the actual elevator cars, a coup that was worth billions and which many people gave Frank credit for, though it was in fact his AI and Slusinski who were responsible, along with Phyllis.Many of the Americans lived out in a tent town east of Sheffield called Texas, sharing the space with internationals who liked the idea of Texas, or had just ended up there randomly.Frank met with as many of them as he could, so that by the time the cable touched down they would be organized and working with a coherent policy or under his thumb, as some of them put it.But happy to be there, as long as it gave them any clout.They knew they were less powerful than the East Asian commonwealth, which was building the elevator car shells, and less powerful than the EC, which had constructed the cable itself.And less powerful than Praxis, and Amex, and Armscor, and Subarashii.Eventually the day came when the cable was going to touch down.A giant crowd gathered in Sheffield to see it; the train station concourse was jammed to well over capacity, as it had a good view along the rim to the base complex, popularly referred to as the socket.As the hours passed, the end of the black column drifted downward, moving more and more slowly as it approached its target.There it hung, not that much bigger than the leader line guiding it down, smaller in fact than the business end of an Energia rocket.It stood up into the sky perfectly vertically, but it was so thin and the foreshortening was so severe that it looked not much longer than a tall skyscraper.A very skinny tall skyscraper, walking on air.A black tree trunk, taller than the sky.We ought to be right under it, down on the floor of the socket, one of his staff said.Thered be headroom when it stops, right?Magnetic field might scramble you a bit, Slusinski replied, never taking his gaze from the sky.As it got closer they saw that the cable was knobbed with various protrusions, and filigreed with silver lines.The gap under it got smaller.Then the end of it disappeared into the base complex, and the seashell roar of the crowd in the concourse grew louder.People watched the TVs closely; cameras inside the socket showed the cable come to a slow halt, still ten meters above the concrete floor.After that came the tweezerlike movement of gantries, and the clamping of a physical collar around the cable, a few meters up from its end.Everything happened in dreamlike slow motion, and when it was done it looked like the round socket room had suddenly gained an ill fitting black roof.Over the loudspeaker system a womans voice said, The elevator is secured.There was a brief cheer.People moved away from the TVs and looked out the tent walls again.Now the object looked much less strange than it had when hanging out of the sky; now it was nothing more than the reductio ad absurdum of Martian architecture, a very slender, very tall black spire.A beanstalk.Peculiar, but not so unsettling.The crowd burst into a thousand conversations, and scattered.And not long after that, the elevators were working.During the years when the cable was extruding from Clarke, robots had been spidering along it, constructing the power lines, safety cables, generators, superconducting pistes, maintenance stations, defense stations, position adjustment rockets, fuel tanks, and emergency shelters that marked the cable every few kilometers.This work had proceeded at the same pace as the cable construction itself, so that soon after touchdown the cars were running up and down, up and down, four hundred of them going in each direction, like parasites on a strand of hair.And a few months after that, you could take an elevator into orbit.And you could take another elevator down out of orbit, to the surface.And down they came, transported from Earth by the fleet of continuous shuttles, those big spaceships that boomed around the Earth Venus Mars system, using the three planets and Luna as gravity handles, fielding madly accelerating ferry packets from Earth and Mars.Each of the thirteen operating ships held a thousand people, and they were full every trip out.So there was a continuous stream of people docking on Clarke, descending in elevator cars, and disembarking in the socket.And then pouring into Sheffields concourses, wild and unsteady and bug eyed as they were herded with some difficulty to the train station, and onto trains outbound.Most of these trains then emptied their loads into the Pavonis tent towns; robot crews were building the tents just fast enough to house the influx, and the completion of two new pipelines had secured the water supply, which was being pumped up from the Compton Aquifer beneath Noctis Labyrinthus.So the emigrants settled in.Back in the socket, on the other side of the cable, upbound elevator cars were being loaded with refined metals, platinum, gold, uranium, and silver.Then the cars swung in and locked onto the piste, and up they rose again, accelerating slowly to their full speed of 300 kilometers an hour.Five days later they arrived at the top of the cable, and decelerated into locks inside the ballast asteroid Clarke, now a much tunneled chunk of carbonaceous chondrite, so filigreed with exterior buildings and interior chambers that it seemed more a spaceship or a city than Marss third moon.It was a busy place; there was a continuous procession of incoming and outgoing ships, and crews perpetually in transit, as well as a large force of local traffic controllers, using some of the most powerful AIs in existence.Though most of the operations involving the cable were computer controlled and robotically accomplished, entire human professions were springing up to direct and oversee all these efforts.And of course media coverage of all the new imagery was immediate and intense; and all in all, despite the decade of waiting, it seemed that on touchdown the elevator had sprung into being like Athena.But there was trouble.Frank found that his staff was spending more and more time dealing with men and women from the tents, who had come into Sheffield and right into their offices, new arrivals who were sometimes nervous, sometimes loud and angry, rattling on about crowded living conditions or insufficient police or bad food.One bulky red faced man wearing a baseball cap shook a finger at them and said, Private security companies come in from tents higher up and offer protection, but theyre just gangs, its just extortion!I cant even give you my name or our security might find out I came here!I mean I believe in the black economy as much as the next guy, but this is crazy!This isnt what we came here for.Frank paced his office, seething.These kinds of allegations were clearly true, but difficult to verify without a security team of ones own, a big police force in fact.When the man left, he grilled his staff, but they could tell him nothing new, which made him even angrier.Youre paid to find these things out for me, thats your jobs!What are you doing sitting around in here all day watching Terran news!He canceled a days appointments, thirty seven meetings in all.Lazy incompetent bastards, he said loudly as he stalked out the door.He went to the train station and caught a local downslope to have a look for himself.The local train now stopped every kilometer of the descent, in small stainless steel locks that served as stations for the tent towns.He got out in one; signs in the lock identified it as El Paso.He walked through the open doors of the passage lock.At least these tents had a view, there was no denying that.Down the great eastern slope of the volcano ran the train piste and the pipelines, and on either side of them tent after tent, like blisters.The clear fabric of the older ones upslope was already turning a bit purple.Ventilators hummed loudly from the physical plant next to the station, and from somewhere a hydrazine generator was adding its high hum.People were conversing in Spanish and English.Frank called his office and got them to ring the apartment of a man from El Paso who had dropped in to complain.The man answered, and Frank arranged to meet him at a caf next to the station, then walked over and sat at an outer table.Men and women sat around tables eating and talking like anywhere else.Little electric cars hummed up and down the narrow streets, most piled high with boxes.The buildings near the station were three stories tall and appeared prefab, steel reinforced concrete painted bright blue and white.There was a line of young trees in tubs running away from the station down the main thoroughfare.Small groups sat on the astroturf, or walked aimlessly from shop to shop, or hurried with shoulderbags and daypacks toward the station.All of them looked a bit disoriented or uncertain, as if they had no habits, or had not yet learned to walk properly.The man showed up with a whole crowd of his neighbors, all in their twenties, too young to be on Mars or so it used to be said.Perhaps the treatment could fix damage from radiation, allow them to reproduce accurately, who could say for sure till they tried?Laboratory animals, thats what they were.What they had always been.It was strange to stand among them like some ancient patriarch, treated with a mixture of awe and condescension, like a grandpa.Irritably he told them to take him on a walk and show him around.They guided him down narrow streets away from the station and the taller buildings, between long rows of what turned out to be Agee huts, which had been designed for temporary shelter in the outlands: research outposts, or water stations, or refugee huts.Now lined up by the score.The slope of the volcano had been hastily graded, and a lot of the huts were on a two  or three degree slope, so that they had to be careful in the kitchens, they said, and make sure to align their beds properly.Frank asked them what they did.Stevedores in Sheffield, most replied; offloading the elevator cars and getting the stuff on trains.Robots were supposed to do it, but it was surprising how much labor remained in the process for human muscle.Heavy equipment operators, robot programmers, machine repairmen, waldo dwarves, construction workers.Most of them had rarely gotten out onto the surface; some of them never had.They had done similar kinds of work back home, or had been unemployed.This was their chance.Most wanted to return to Earth someday, but the gyms were crowded and expensive and time consuming, and they were all losing their tone.They had southern accents that Frank hadnt heard since childhood; it was like hearing voices from a previous century, like listening to Elizabethans.Did people still talk that way?TV never revealed it.Yall been here so long you dont mind being indoors, but I cant stand it.Ah caint stayun det.Frank glared into a kitchen.What do you eat?he demanded.Fish, vegetables, rice, tofu.It all came in bulk packages.They had no complaints, they thought it was good.Americans, the most degraded palates in history.Somebody gimme a cheeseburger!No, what they minded was the confinement, the lack of privacy, the teleoperation, the crowding together.And the resulting problems: All my stuff got stole the day after I got here.Me too.Me too.Theft, assault, extortion.The criminals all came from other tent towns, they said.Russians, they said.White folks with strange talk.Some black folks too, but not so many here as at home.A woman had been raped the previous week.Youre kidding!Frank said.What do you mean youre kidding, one woman said, disgusted with him.Eventually they led him back to the station.Pausing in the door, Frank didnt know what to say to them.Quite a crowd had gathered, as people had recognized him or been called or drawn to the group.Ill see what I can do, he muttered, and ducked through the passage lock.Thoughtlessly he stared into tents as he rode a train back up.There was one fitted with coffin hotels, Tokyo style.That would be much more crowded than El Paso, but did its occupants care about that?Some people were used to being treated like ball bearings.A lot of people, in fact.But on Mars it was supposed to be different!Back in Sheffield he stalked the rim concourse, staring out at the thin vertical line of the elevator, ignoring other people and forcing some of them to jump out of his way as he paced.Once he stopped and looked around at the crowd; there were perhaps 500 people in view at that moment, living their lives.When had it gotten like this?They had been a scientific outpost, a handful of researchers, scattered over a world with as much land surface as the Earth: a whole Eurasia, Africa, America, Australia, and Antarctica, all for them.All that land was still out there, but what percentage of it was under tents and habitable?Much less than 1 percent.And yet what was UNOMA saying?A million people here already, with more on the way.And no police, and crime or rather, crime without police.A million people and no law, no law but corporate law.The bottom line.Minimize expenses, maximize profits.Run smoothly on ball bearings.The next week the people in a set of tents on the south slope went on strike.Chalmers heard about it on his way to the office, Slusinski actually breaking in on his walk with a call.The striking tents were mostly American, and his staff was in a panic.Theyve closed the stations and arent allowing anyone off the trains, so they cant be controlled unless their emergency locks are stormed  Shut up.Frank went down the south piste to the striking tents, ignoring Slusinskis objections.In fact he ordered several of the staff down to join him.A team from Sheffield security was standing in the station, but he ordered them to get on the train and leave, and after a consultation with the Sheffield administrators, they did.At the passage lock he identified himself, and asked to come in alone.They let him through.He emerged in the main square of another tent, surrounded by a sea of angry faces.Kill the TVs, he suggested.Lets talk in private.They killed the TVs.It was the same as in El Paso, different accents but the same complaints.His earlier visit gave him the ability to anticipate what they were going to say, to say it before they did.He watched grimly as their faces revealed how impressed they were by this ability.They were young.Look, its a bad situation, he said after they had talked for an hour.But if you strike for long, youll only make it worse.Theyll send in security and it wont be like living with gangs and police among you, itll be like living in prison.Youve made your point already, and now youve got to know when to let off and negotiate.Form a committee to represent you, and make a list of complaints and demands.Document all the incidents of crime, just write them down and get the victims to sign the statements.Ill make good use of them.Its going to take work at UNOMA and back home, because theyre breaking the treaty.He paused to get control of himself, relax his jaw.Meanwhile, get back to work!Itll pass the time better than sitting around cooped up in here, and itll make you points for the negotiation.And if you dont, theyll maybe just cut off your food and make you.Better to do it of your own free will, and look like rational negotiators.So the strike ended.They even gave him a ragged round of applause when he went back out into the station.He got on the train in a blinding fury, refusing to acknowledge any of his staffs questions or their mute looks of idiot inquiry, and savaging the head of the security team, who was an arrogant fool.If you corrupt bastards had any integrity this wouldnt have happened!Youre nothing but a protection racket!Why are people getting assaulted in the tents?Why are they paying protection, where are you when all this is happening!Its not our jurisdiction, the man said, white lipped.Oh come on, what is your jurisdiction?Your pocket is your only jurisdiction.He went on until the security men got up and left the car, as angry at him as he was at them, but too disciplined or scared to talk back.In the Sheffield offices he strode from room to room, shouting at the staff and making calls.Sax, Vlad, Janet.He told them what was happening, and they all eventually offered the same suggestion, which he had to admit was a good one.He would have to go up the elevator, and talk to Phyllis.See if you can manage the reservations, he said to his staff.The elevator car was like an old Amsterdam house, narrow and tall, with a light filled room at the top, in this case a clear walled and domed chamber that reminded Frank of the bubble dome of the Ares.On the second day of the trip he joined the cars other passengers (only twenty on this one, there werent too many people going this way) and they took the cars own little interior elevator up the thirty stories to this clear penthouse, to see Phobos pass.The outer perimeter of the room was set out over the elevator proper, so there was a view down as well.Frank stared down at the curved line of the planets horizon, much whiter and thicker than the last time he had seen it.Atmosphere at 150 millibars now, really quite impressive, even if it was composed of poison gas.While they were waiting for the little moons appearance Frank stared at the planet below.The gossamer arrow of the cable pointed straight down at it; it looked like they were rising on a tall slender rocket, a strange attenuated rocket which stretched some kilometers above and below them.That was all they would ever see of the cable.And below them the round orange floor of Mars looked just as blank as it had on their first approach so long ago, unchanged despite all their meddling.One only had to get far enough away.Then one of the elevator pilots pointed out Phobos, a dim white object to the west.In ten minutes it was upon them, flashing past with astonishing speed, a large gray potato hurtling faster than the head could turn.Zip!Gone.The observers in the penthouse hooted, exclaimed, chattered.Frank had caught only the merest glimpse of the dome on Stickney, winking like a gem in the rock.And there had been a piste banding the middle like a wedding ring, and some bright silver lumps; that was all he could recall of the blurred image.Fifty kilometers away when it passed, the pilot said.At 7,000 kilometers an hour.Not all that fast, actually, there were meteors that hit the planet at 50,000 kilometers an hour.But fast enough.Frank went back down to the dining floor, trying to fix the hurtling image in his mind.Phobos: people at the dining table next to him talked of shoving it up into a braided orbit with Deimos.It was out of the loop now, a new Azores, nothing but an inconvenience to the cable.And Phyllis had argued all along that Mars itself would have suffered the same fate in the solar system at large, unless the elevator were built to climb its gravity well; they would have been bypassed by miners going to the metal rich asteroids, which had no gravity wells to contend with.And then there were the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, the outer planets....But there was no danger of that now.On the fifth day they approached Clarke and slowed down.It had been an asteroid about two kilometers across, a carbonaceous hunk now shaped to a cube, with every centimeter of its Mars facing surface graded and covered with concrete, steel, or glass.The cable plunged right into the center of this assemblage; there were holes on both sides of the joint where cable met moon, just big enough to allow passage to the elevator cars.They slid up into one of these holes and came to a smooth stop.The interior space they slid into was like a vertical subway station.The passengers got out and went their ways into the tunnels of Clarke.One of Phylliss assistants met him and drove him in a little car through a warren of rock walled tunnels.They came to Phylliss offices, which were rooms on the planet side of the moon, walled with mirrors and green bamboo.Though they were almost in microgravity and only drifting very slowly away from Mars, they stood on that floor and rip ripped around in velcro shoes.A rather conservative practice, but to be expected in such an Earth regarding place.Frank exchanged his shoes for some Velcro slippers by the door and followed suit.Phyllis was just finishing a talk with a couple of men.Not only a cheap and clean lift out of the gravity well, but a propulsion system for slinging loads all over the solar system!Its an extraordinarily elegant piece of engineering, dont you think?Yes!the men replied.She looked about fifty years old.After fulsome introductions the men were from Amex the others left.When Phyllis and Frank were the only ones left in the room, Frank said to her, Youd better stop using this extraordinarily elegant piece of engineering to flood Mars with emigrants, or itll blow up in your face and youll lose your anchoring point.Oh Frank.She laughed.She really had aged well: hair silver, face handsomely lined and taut, figure trim.Neat as a pin in a rust jumpsuit and lots of gold jewelry, which together with her silver hair gave her an overall metallic sheen.She even looked at Frank through gold wire rimmed glasses, an affectation that distanced her from the room, as if she were focusing on flat video images on the insides of her spectacles.You cant send down so many so fast, he insisted.Theres no infrastructure for them, physically or culturally.Whats developing are the worst kind of wildcat settlements, theyre like refugee camps or forced labor camps, and itll get reported like that back home, you know how they always use analogies to Terran situations.And thats bound to hurt you.She stared at a spot about three feet in front of him.Most people dont see it that way, she proclaimed, as if the room were full of listeners.This is just a step on the path to full human use of Mars.Its here for us and were going to use it.Earth is desperately crowded, and the mortality rate is still dropping.Science and faith will continue to create new opportunities as they always have.These first pioneers may suffer some hardships, but those wont last long.We lived worse than they do now, when we first arrived.Startled at this lie, Frank glared at her.But she did not back down.Scornfully he said, Youre not paying attention!But the thought frightened him, and he paused.He brought himself back under control, stared through the clear ceiling at the planet.As they were rotating with it they always looked up at Tharsis, of course, and from this distance it looked like one of the old photographs, the orange ball with all the familiar markings of its most famous hemisphere: the great volcanoes, Noctis, the canyons, the chaos, all unblemished.When was the last time you went down?he asked her.Ell ess sixty.I go down regularly.She smiled.Where do you stay when you descend?In UNOMA dorms.Where she worked busily to break the U. N.  treaty.But that was her job, that was what UNOMA had assigned her to do.Elevator manager, and also the primary liaison with the mining concerns.When she quit the U. N. , she could take all the jobs she could handle from them.Queen of the elevator.Which was now the bridge for the greater part of the Martian economy.Shed have at her disposal all the capital of whatever transnationals she chose to associate with.And all this showed, of course, in the way she rip ripped around the brilliant glassine room, in the way she smiled at all his withering remarks.Well, she always had been a little stupid.Frank gritted his teeth.Apparently it was time to start using the good old USA like a sledgehammer, see if it had any heft remaining in it.Most of the transnationals have giant holdings in the States, he said.If the American government decided to freeze their assets, because they were breaking the treaty, it would slow down all of them, and break some.You could never do that, Phyllis said.It would bankrupt the government.Thats like threatening a dead man with hanging.A couple more zeroes on the figure are just one more level of unreality, no one can really imagine it anymore.The only ones who even think they can are exactly your transnational executives.They hold the debt, but no one else cares about their money.I could convince Washington of this in a minute, and then you just see how it blows up in your face.Whichever way it goes, it wrecks your game.He waved a hand angrily.At which point someone else will occupy these rooms, and a sudden intuitionyoull be back in Underhill.That got her attention, no doubt about it.Her easy contempt took on a sudden edge.No single person can convince Washington of anything.Its quicksand down there.Youll have your say and Ill have mine, and well see who has more influence.And she rip ripped across the room and opened the door, and loudly welcomed a gang of U. N.  officials.So.A waste of time.He wasnt surprised; unlike those who had advised him to come, he had had no faith in the idea of Phyllis being rational.As with many religious fundamentalists, business for her was part of the religion; the two dogmas were mutually reinforcing, part of the same system.Reason had nothing to do with it.And while she might still believe in Americas power, she certainly didnt believe in Franks ability to wield it.Fair enough.He would prove her wrong.On the trip back down the cable, he scheduled video appointments on the half hour, for fifteen hours a day.His messages to Washington quickly got him into complex, transmission delayed conversations with his people in the State and Commerce departments, and with the various cabinet heads who mattered.Soon the new President would give him a meeting as well.Meanwhile message after message, back and forth, leapfrogging around in the various arguments, replying to whichever correspondent got back to him first.It was complicated, exhausting.The case down on Earth had to be built like a house of cards, and a lot of them were bent.Near the end, with the cable visible all the way down into the Sheffield socket, he suddenly felt really odd it was a physical wave that passed through him.The sensation passed, and after a bit of thought he decided it must have been that the decelerating car had passed momentarily through one g.  An image came to him, of running out a long pier, wet uneven boards splashed with silver fish scales; he could even smell the salt fish stink.One g.  Funny how the body remembered it.Once resettled in Sheffield, he went back to the continuous round of recording messages and analyzing the incoming replies, dealing with old cronies and with upcoming powers, all the talk patched together into a crazy quilt of arguments proceeding at different rates.At one point, late in the northern autumn, he was engaged in about fifty conferences simultaneously; it was like those people who play chess blind with a room full of opponents.Three weeks of this, however, and it began to come around, basically because President Incaviglia himself was extremely interested in getting any leverage he could over Amex and Mitsubishi and Armscor.He was more than willing to leak to the media his intent to look into allegations of treaty violations.He did that, and stocks fell sharply in the relevant quarters.And two days later, the elevator consortium announced that enthusiasm for Martian opportunities had been so great that demand had exceeded supply for the time being.They would raise prices, of course, as their creed required; but they would also have to slow down emigration temporarily, until more towns and robotic townbuilders had been constructed.Frank first heard this on a bar TV news report, one evening in a caf over his solitary dinner.He grinned wolfishly as he chewed.So we see whos better at wrestling in quicksand, you bitch.He finished eating and went for a walk along the rim concourse.It was only one battle, he knew.And it was going to be a bitter long war.But still, it was nice.Then in the northern middle winter the occupants of the oldest American tent on the east slope rioted, and threw out all the UNOMA police inside, and locked themselves in.The Russians next door did the same.A quick conference with Slusinski gave Frank the background.Apparently both groups were employed by the road building subdivision of Armscor, and both tents had been invaded and attacked in the middle of the night by Asian toughs, who had slashed the tent fabric and killed three men in each tent, and knifed a bunch of others.The Americans and Russians both claimed the attackers were yakuza on a race rage, although it sounded to Frank like Subarashiis security force, a small army that was mostly Korean.In any case, UNOMA police teams had arrived on the scene and found the attackers gone, and the tents in a turmoil.They had sealed the two tents, then denied permission for those inside to leave.The inhabitants had concluded they were prisoners, and enraged by this injustice they had burst out of their locks and destroyed the piste running through their stations with welders, and several people on both sides had been killed.The UNOMA police had sent in massive reinforcements, and the workers inside the two tents were more trapped than ever.Enraged and disgusted, Frank went down again to deal with it in person.He had to ignore not only the standard objections of his staff, but also the new factors prohibition (Helmut had been called back to Earth).Once at the station he also had to face down the UNOMA police head, no easy task.Never before had he tried to rely so heavily on the charisma of the first hundred, and it made him furious.In the end he had to simply walk through the policemen, a crazy old man striding through all civilized restraint.And no one there cared to stop him, not this time.The crowd inside the tent looked ugly indeed on the monitors, but he banged on their passage lock door and finally was let in, into a crush of angry young men and women.He walked through the inner lock door and breathed hot stale air.So many people were shouting he could make nothing out, but the ones in front recognized him and were clearly surprised to see him there.A couple of them cheered.All right!Im here!he shouted.Who speaks for you?They had no spokesperson.He swore viciously.What kind of fools are you?Youd better learn to operate the system, or youll be in bags like this one forever.Bags like this or else bodybags.Several people shouted things at him, but most wanted to hear what he would say.And still no sign of a spokes person, so Chalmers shouted, All right, Ill talk to all of you!Sit down so I can see whos speaking!They would not sit, but they did stand without moving, in a group around him, there on the tattered astroturf of the tents main square.Chalmers balanced himself on an upturned box in the middle of them.It was late afternoon and they cast shadows far down the slope to the east, into the tents below.He asked what had happened, and various voices described the midnight attack, the skirmish in the station.You were provoked, he said when they were done.They wanted you to make some fool move and you did, its one of the oldest tricks in the book.Theyve gotten you to kill some third parties that had nothing to do with the attack on you, and now youre the murderers the police have caught!You were stupid!The crowd murmured and swore at him angrily, but some were taken aback.Those so called police were in on it too!one of them said loudly.Maybe so, Chalmers said, but it was corporate troops that attacked you, not some random Japanese on a rampage.You should have been able to tell the difference, you should have bothered to find out!As it is you played into their hands, and the UNOMA police were happy to go along, theyre on the other side right now, at least some of them.But the national armies are shifting over to your side!So youve got to learn to cooperate with them, youve got to figure out who your allies are, and act accordingly!I dont know why there are so few people on this planet capable of doing that.Its like the passage from Earth scrambles the brain or something.Some laughed a startled laugh.Frank asked them about conditions in the tents.They had the same complaints as the others had, and again he could anticipate, and say it for them.Then he described the result of his trip to Clarke.I got a moratorium on emigration, and that means more than just time to build more towns.It means the start of a new phase between the U. S.  and the U. N.  They finally figured it out in Washington that the U. N.  is working for the transnationals, and so they need to enforce the treaty themselves.Its in Washingtons best interest, and theyre the only ones thatll do it.The treaty is part of the battle now, the battle between people and the transnationals.Youre in that battle and youve been attacked, and you have to figure out who to attack back, and how to connect up with your allies!They were looking grim at this, which showed sense, and Frank said, Eventually were going to win, you know.Theres more of us than them.So much for the carrot, such as it was.As for the stick, that was always easy with people as powerless as these.Look, if the national governments cant calm things down quick, if theres more unrest here and things start coming apart, theyll say the hell with it let the transnats solve their labor problems themselves, theyll be more efficient at it.And you know what that means for you.Were sick of this!one man shouted.Of course you are, he said.He pointed a finger.So do you have a plan to bring it to an end, or not?It took a while to rachet them into agreement.Disarm, cooperate, organize, petition the American government for help, for justice.Put themselves in his hands, in effect.Of course it took a while.And along the way he had to promise to address every complaint, to solve every injustice, to right every wrong.It was ridiculous, obscene; but he pursed his lips and did it.He gave them advice in media relations and arbitration technique, he told them how to organize cells and committees, to elect leaders.They were so ignorant!Young men and women, educated very carefully to be apolitical, to be technicians who thought they disliked politics, making them putty in the hands of their rulers, just like always.It was appalling how stupid they were, really, and he could not help lashing into them.He left to cheers.Maya was out there in the station.Exhausted, he could only stare at her in disbelief.She had been watching him over the video, she said.Frank shook his head, the fools inside hadnt even bothered to disable the interior cameras, were possibly even unaware of their existence.So the world had seen it all.And Maya had that certain look of admiration on her face, as if pacifying exploited laborers with lies and sophistry were the highest heroism.Which to her it no doubt was.In fact she was off to employ the same techniques in the Russian tent, because there had been no progress there, and they had asked for her.The MarsFirst president!So the Russians were even more foolish than the Americans, apparently.She asked him to accompany her, and he was too exhausted to run a cost/benefit analysis of the act.With a twist of the mouth he agreed.It was easier just to tag along.They took the train down to the next station, made their way through the police and inside.The Russian tent was packed like a circuit board.Youre going to have a harder job of it than I did, Frank said as he looked around.Russians are used to it, she said.These tents arent that different from Moscow apartments.Yes, yes.Russia had become a kind of immense Korea, sporting the same brutal streamlined capitalism, perfectly Taylorized and with a veneer of democracy and consumer goods covering the junta.Its amazing how little you need to keep starving people strung along.Frank, please.Just remember that and it will go okay.Are you going to help or not?she demanded.Yes, yes.The central square smelled of bean curd and borscht and electrical fires, and the crowd was much more unruly and loud than in the American tent, everyone there a defiant leader, ready to unleash a declamation.A lot more of them were women than in the American tent.They had unpisted a train and this had galvanized them, they were anxious for more action.Maya had to use a hand megaphone, and all the time that she stood on a chair and talked, the crowd swirled around them and participants in several loud arguments ignored her, as if she were a cocktail lounge pianist.Franks Russian was rusty, and he couldnt understand most of what the crowd shouted at Maya, but he followed her replies pretty well.She was explaining the emigration moratorium, the bottleneck in town robot production and in water supplies, the necessity for discipline, the promise of a better life to come if all was enacted in an orderly fashion.He supposed it was a classic babushka harangue, and it had the effect of pacifying them somewhat, as there was a strong reactionary streak in many Russians now; they remembered what social unrest really meant, and were justifiably afraid of it.And there was a lot to promise, it all seemed plausible: big world, few people, lots of material resources, some good robot designs, computer programs, gene templates....In one really loud moment of the discussion he said to her in English, Remember the stick.What?she snapped.The stick.Threaten them.Carrot and stick.She nodded.Into the megaphone again: the never to be taken for granted fact of the poisonous air, the deadly cold.They were alive only because of the tents, and the input of electricity and water.Vulnerable in ways they hadnt fully thought out, in ways that didnt exist back home.She was quick, she always had been.Back to promises.Back and forth, stick and carrot, a jerk on the leash, some niblets.Eventually the Russians too were pacified.Afterward on the train up to Sheffield Maya gabbled with nervous relief, face flushed, eyes brilliant, hand clutching his arm as she threw her head back abruptly and laughed.That nervous intelligence, that arresting physical presence...He must have been exhausted himself, or more shaken than he had realized by the time in the tents, or maybe it was the encounter with Phyllis; because he felt himself warming to her, it was like stepping into a sauna after a freezing day outside, with that same sense of relief from vigilance, of penetrating ease.I dont know what I would have done without you, she was saying rapidly, really you are so good in those situations, so clear and firm and sharp.They believe you because you dont try to flatter them or soften the truth.Thats what works best, he said, looking out the window at the tents running by.Especially when youre flattering them and lying to them.Oh Frank.Its true.Youre good at it yourself.This was an example of the trope under discussion, but Maya didnt see it.There was a name for that in rhetoric, but he couldnt recall it.Metonymy?Synecdoche?But she only laughed and squeezed his shoulder, leaning against him.As if the fight in Burroughs had never happened, not to mention everything before that.And in Sheffield she ignored her stop, and got off the train with him at his stop, walking at his shoulder through the spaciousness of the rim station, and then to his rooms, where she stripped and showered and put on one of his jumpers, chattering all the while about the day and the situation at large, as if they did this all the time: went out to dinner, soup, trout, salad, a bottle of wine, every night sure!Leaning back in their chairs, drinking coffee and brandy.Politicians after a day of politics.The leaders.She had finally wound down, and was poured into her chair, content just to watch him.And for a wonder it didnt make him nervous, it was as if some force field protected him from all that.Perhaps the look in her eye.Sometimes it seemed you really could tell if someone liked you.She spent the night.And after that she divided her time between her quarters at the MarsFirst office and his rooms, without ever discussing what she was doing, or what it meant.And when it was time for bed, she would take off her clothes and roll in next to him, and then onto him, warm and calm.The touch of a whole body, all at once....And if he ever started things, she was so quick to respond; he only had to touch her arm.Like stepping into a sauna.She was so easy these days, so calm.Like a different person, it was amazing.Not Maya at all; but there she was, whispering Frank, Frank.But they never talked about any of that.It was always the situation, the days news, and in truth that gave them a lot to talk about.The unrest on Pavonis had gone into abeyance temporarily, but the troubles were planetwide, and getting worse: sabotages, strikes, riots, fights, skirmishes, murder.And the news from Earth had plummeted through even the blackest of gallows humor, into just plain awfulness.Mars was the picture of order in comparison, a little local eddy spun away from the vortex of a giant maelstrom, which looked to Frank like a death spiral for everything that fell into it.Little wars like matchheads were flaring everywhere.India and Pakistan had used nuclear weapons in Kashmir.Africa was dying, and the North bickered over who should help first.One day they got word that the mohole town Hephaestus, west of Elysium, manned by Americans and Russians, had been entirely deserted.Radio contact had stopped, and when people went down from Elysium to look, they had found the town empty.All Elysium was in an uproar, and Frank and Maya decided to see if they could do something in person.They took the train down Tharsis together, back down into the thickening air and across the rocky plains now piebald with snowdrifts that never melted, with snow that was a dirty granular pink, conforming tightly to the north slope of every dune and rock, like colored shadows.And then onto the glistening crazed black plains of Isidis, where the permafrost melted on the warmest summer days, and then refroze in a bright black crackle.A tundra in the making, maybe even a marsh.Flying by the train windows were tufts of black grass, perhaps even arctic flowers.Or maybe it was just litter.Burroughs was quiet and uneasy, the broad grassy boulevards empty, their green as shocking as a hallucination or an afterimage of looking into the sun.While waiting for the train to Elysium, Frank went to the stations storage room and reclaimed the contents of his Burroughs room, which he had left behind.The attendant returned with a single large box, containing a bachelors kitchen equipment, a lamp, some jumpers, a lectern.He didnt remember any of it.He put the lectern in his pocket and tossed the rest of it in a trash dumper.Wasted years he couldnt remember a day of them.The treaty negotiation was now revealed as pure theater, as if someone had kicked a stage strut and brought down the whole backdrop, revealing real history on the back steps, two men exchanging a handshake and a nod.The Russian office in Burroughs wanted Maya to stay and deal with some business there, so Frank took a train on to Elysium by himself, and then joined a rover caravan out to Hephaestus.The people in his car were subdued by his presence, and irritably he ignored them and glanced through his old lectern.A standard selection for the most part, a great book series only slightly augmented by some political philosophy packages.A hundred thousand volumes; lecterns today beat that a hundredfold, although it was a pointless improvement, as there was no longer time to read even a single book.He had been fond of Nietzsche in those days, apparently.About half the marked passages were from him, and glancing through them Frank couldnt see why, it was all windy drivel.And then he read one that made him shudder: The individual is, in his future and his past, a piece of fate, one law more, one necessity more for everything that is and everything that will be.To say to him change yourself means to demand that everything should change, even in the past....In Hephaestus a new mohole crew was settling in, old timers for the most part, tech and engineering types, but much more sophisticated than the newcomers on Pavonis.Frank talked with quite a few of them, asking about those who had disappeared, and one morning at breakfast, next to a window that looked out on the moholes solid white thermal plume, an American woman who reminded him of Ursula said, These people have seen the videos all their life, theyre students of Mars, they believe in it like a grail, and organize their lives around getting here.They work for years, and save, and then sell everything they have to get passage, because they have an idea of what it will be like.And then they get here and theyre incarcerated, or at best back in the old rut, in indoor jobs so its all just like its still on TV.And so they disappear.Because theyre looking for more of the kind of thing they came here for.But they dont know how the disappeared live!Chalmers objected.Or even if they survive at all!The woman shook her head.Word gets around.People come back.There are one play videos that show up occasionally.The people around her nodded.And we can see whats coming up from Earth after us.Best to get into the country while the chance is still there.Frank shook his head, amazed.It was the same thing the bench presser in the mining camp had been saying, but coming from this calm middle aged woman it was somehow more disturbing.That night, unable to sleep, he put out a call for Arkady, and got him half an hour later.Arkady was on Olympus Mons of all places, up at the observatory.What do you want?Frank said.What do you imagine will happen if everyone here slips away into the highlands?Arkady grinned.Why then we will make a human life, Frank.We will work to support our needs, and do science, and perhaps terraform a bit more.We will sing and dance and walk around in the sun, and work like maniacs for food and curiosity.Its impossible, Frank exclaimed.Were part of the world, we cant escape it.Cant we?Its only the blue evening star, the world you speak of.This red world is the only real one for us, now.Frank gave up, exasperated.He had never been able to talk to Arkady, never.With John it had been different; but then he and John had been friends.He trained back to Elysium.The Elysium massif rose over the horizon like an enormous saddle dropped on the desert; the steep slopes of the two volcanoes were pinkish white now, deep in snows that had packed down to firn, and would become glaciers before too long.He had always thought of the Elysium cities as a counterweight to Tharsis older, smaller, more manageable and sane.But now people there were disappearing by the hundreds; it was a jump off point into the unknown nation, hidden out there in the cratered wilderness.In Elysium they asked him to give a speech to a group of American newcomers, on the first evening of their orientation.A formal speech, but there was an informal gathering before, and Frank wandered around asking questions as usual.Of course well get out if we can, one man said to him boldly.Others chipped in immediately.They told us not to come here if we wanted to get outdoors much.Its not like that on Mars, they said.Who do they think theyre fooling?We can see the video you sent back as well as they can.Hell, every other article you read is about the Mars underground, and how theyre communists or nudists or Rosicrucians  Utopias or caravans or cave dwelling primitives  Amazons or lamas or cowboys  What it is, is everyones projecting their fantasies out here because its so bad back there, do you understand?Maybe theres a single coordinated counterworld  Thats another big fantasy, the totalizing fantasy  The true masters of the planet, why not?Hidden away, maybe led by your friend Hiroko, maybe in contact with your friend Arkady, maybe not.Who knows?No one knows for sure, not on Earth they dont.Its all stories.Its the best story going right now, and millions of people on Earth are into it, theyre addicted to it.A lot of them want to come, but only a few of us get to.And a good percentage of those of us who got chosen went through the whole selection process lying through our teeth to get here.Yes, yes, Frank interjected gloomily.We all did that.It reminded him of Michels old joke; since they were all going to go crazy anyway ...Well there you are!What did you expect?I dont know.He shook his head unhappily.But its all fantasy, do you understand?The need to stay hidden would hamper any community in a crippling way.Its all stories, when you get right down to it.Then where are all the disappeared going?Frank shrugged uneasily, and they grinned.An hour later he was still thinking about it.Everyone had moved out into an open air amphitheater, built from fixed salt blocks in classical Greek style.The semicircle of rising white benches was filled with bodies topped by attentive faces, waiting for his speech, curious to see what one of the first hundred would say to them; he was a relic of the past, a character out of history, he had been on Mars ten years before some of the people in the audience were born, and his memories of Earth were of their grandparents time, on the other side of a vast and shadowy chasm of years.The classical Greeks had certainly gotten the size and proportions right for a single orator; he hardly had to raise his voice, and they all heard him.He told them some of the usual things, his standard address, all chopped and censored, as it was sadly tattered by current events.It didnt sound very coherent, even to him.Look, he said, desperately revising as he spoke, ad libbing, searching through the faces in the crowd, when we came up here we came to a different place, to a new world, and that necessarily makes us different beings than we were before.None of the old directives from Earth matter.Inevitably we will make a new Martian society, just in the nature of things.It comes out of the decisions we make together, by our collective action.And they are decisions that were making in our time, in these years, right now at this very instant.But if you dodge off into the outback and join one of the hidden colonies, you isolate yourself!You remain whatever you were when you came, never metamorphosing into a Martian human.And you also deprive the rest of us of your expertise and your input.I know this personally, believe me.Pain lanced through him, he was astonished to feel it.As you know, some of the first hundred were the first to disappear, presumably under the leadership of Hiroko Ai.I still dont understand why they did it, I really dont.But how we have missed her genius for systems design in the years since, I can hardly tell you!Why, I think you can accurately say that part of our problems now result from her absence these many years.He shook his head, tried to gather his thoughts.The first time I saw this canyon were in, I was with her.It was one of the first explorations to this area, and I had Hiroko Ai at my side, and we looked down into this canyon, its floor bare and flat, and she said to me, Its like the floor of a room.He stared at the audience, trying to remember Hirokos face.Yes...no.Strange how one remembered faces until you tried to look at them in your mind, when they turned away from you.Ive missed her.I come here, and its impossible to believe its the same place, and so...its hard to believe I ever really knew her.He paused, tried to focus on their faces.Do you understand?No!someone bellowed.A flicker of his old anger boiled through his confusion.Im saying we have to make a new Mars here!Im saying were completely new beings, that nothing is the same here!Nothing is the same!He had to give up, go sit down.Other speakers took over, and their droning voices floated over him as he sat, stunned, looking out the open end of the amphitheater into a park of wide set sycamore trees.Slender white buildings beyond, trees growing on their roofs and balconies.A green and white vision.He couldnt tell them.No one could tell them.Only time, and Mars itself.And in the meantime they would act in obvious contradiction to their own best interests.It happened all the time, but how could it, how?Why were people so stupid?He left the amphitheater, stalked through the park and the town.How can people act against their own obvious material interests?he demanded of Slusinski over his wristpad.Its crazy!Marxists were materialists, how did they explain it?Ideology, sir.But if the material world and our method of manipulating it determine everything else, how can ideology happen?Where did they say it comes from?Some of them defined ideology as an imaginary relationship to a real situation.They acknowledged that imagination was a powerful force in human life.But then they werent materialists at all!He swore with disgust.No wonder Marxism is dead.Well, sir, actually a lot of people on Mars call themselves Marxists.Shit!They might as well call themselves Zoroastrians, or Jansenists, or Hegelians.Marxists are Hegelian, sir.Shut up, Frank snarled, and broke the connection.Imaginary beings, in a real landscape.No wonder he had forgotten the carrot and the stick, and wandered off into the realm of new being and radical difference and all that crap.Trying to be John Boone.Yes, it was true!He was trying to do what John had done.But John had been good at it; Frank had seen him work his magic time after time in the old days, changing everything just by the way he talked.While for Frank the words were like rocks in his mouth.Even now, when it was just what they needed, when it was the only thing that would save them.Maya met him at the Burroughs station, gave him a hug.He endured it stiffly, his bags hanging from his hand.Outside the tent low chocolate thunderheads billowed in a mauve sky.He couldnt meet her eye.You were wonderful, she said.Everyone is talking about it.For an hour.After which the emigrants would disappear as before.It was a world of acts, and words had no more influence on acts than the sound of a waterfall has on the flow of the stream.He hurried off to the mesa offices.Maya came along and chattered at him as he checked into one of the yellow walled rooms on the fourth floor.Bamboo furniture, flowery sheets and couch cushions.Maya was full of plans, cheery, pleased with him.She was pleased with him!He crushed his teeth together until they hurt.Bruxism was giving him headaches and all kinds of facial pain, wearing through his crowns and the cartilage in his jaw joints.Finally he stood and walked to the door.I have to go for a walk, he said.As he left he saw her face in his peripheral vision: hurt surprise.As usual.He walked quickly down to the sward, and paced off the long row of Bareiss columns, their disarray like bowling pins caught flying.On the other side of the canal he sat at a round white table at the edge of a sidewalk caf, and nursed a Greek coffee for an hour.Suddenly Maya was standing before him.
