..seven...Eight!She had never before risked eight.In a recess of her mind there grew a sense of urgency, a crying out against such wildness as this.The instrument of prisms and target could not think, feel caution or remorse.And it carried a real blade.To go against less defeated the purpose of such training.That attacking blade could maim and it could kill.But the finest swordsmen in the Imperium never went against more than seven lights.Nine!Alia experienced a sense of supreme exaltation.Attacking blade and target became blurs among blurs.She felt that the sword in her hand had come alive.She was an anti target.She did not move the blade; it moved her.Ten!Eleven!Something flashed past her shoulder, slowed at the shield aura around the target, slid through and tripped the deactivating stud.The lights darkened.Prisms and target twisted their way to stillness.Alia whirled, angered by the intrusion, but her reaction was thrown into tension by awareness of the supreme ability which had hurled that knife.It had been a throw timed to exquisite nicety   just fast enough to get through the shield zone and not too fast to be deflected.And it had touched a one millimeter spot within an eleven light target.Alia found her own emotions and tensions running down in a manner not unlike that of the target dummy.She was not at all surprised to see who had thrown the knife.Paul stood just inside the training room doorway, Stilgar three steps behind him.Her brother's eyes were squinted in anger.Alia, growing conscious of her nudity, thought to cover herself, found the idea amusing.What the eyes had seen could not be erased.Slowly, she replaced the crysknife in its sheath at her neck."I might've known," she said."I presume you know how dangerous that was," Paul said.He took his time reading the reactions on her face and body: the flush of her exertions coloring her skin, the wet fullness of her lips.There was a disquieting femaleness about her that he had never considered in his sister.He found it odd that he could look at a person who was this close to him and no longer recognize her in the identity framework which had seemed so fixed and familiar."That was madness," Stilgar rasped, coming up to stand beside Paul.The words were angry, but Alia heard awe in his voice, saw it in his eyes."Eleven lights," Paul said, shaking his head."I'd have made it twelve if you hadn't interfered," she said.She began, to pale under his close regard, added: "And why do the damned things have that many lights if we're not supposed to try for them?""A Bene Gesserit should ask the reasoning behind an open ended system?"Paul asked."I suppose you never tried for more than seven!"she said, anger returning.His attentive posture began to annoy her."Just once," Paul said."Gurney Halleck caught me on ten.My punishment was sufficiently embarrassing that I won't tell you what he did.And speaking of embarrassment...  ""Next time, perhaps you'll have yourselves announced," she said.She brushed past Paul into the bedroom, found a loose gray robe, slipped into it, began brushing her hair before a wall mirror.She felt sweaty, sad, a post coitus kind of sadness that left her with a desire to bathe once more...and to sleep."Why're you here?"she asked."My Lord," Stilgar said.There was an odd inflection in his voice that brought Alia around to stare at him."We're here at Irulan's suggestion," Paul said, "as strange as that may seem.She believes, and information in Stil's possession appears to confirm it, that our enemies are about to make a major try for   "  "My Lord!"Stilgar said, his voice sharper.As her brother turned, questioning, Alia continued to look at the old Fremen Naib.Something about him now made her intensely aware that he was one of the primitives.Stilgar believed in a supernatural world very near him.It spoke to him in a simple pagan tongue dispelling all doubts.The natural universe in which he stood was fierce, unstoppable, and it lacked the common morality of the Imperium."Yes, Stil," Paul said."Do you want to tell her why we came?""This isn't the time to talk of why we came," Stilgar said."What's wrong, Stil?"Stilgar continued to stare at Alia."Sire, are you blind?"Paul turned back to his sister, a feeling of unease beginning to fill him.Of all his aides, only Stilgar dared speak to him in that tone, but even Stilgar measured the occasion by its need."This one must have a mate!"Stilgar blurted."There'll be trouble if she's not wed, and that soon. "Alia whirled away, her face suddenly hot.How did he touch me?she wondered.Bene Gesserit self control had been powerless to prevent her reaction.How had Stilgar done that?He hadn't the power of the Voice.She felt dismayed and angry."Listen to the great Stilgar!"Alia said, keeping her back to them, aware of a shrewish quality in her voice and unable to hide it."Advice to maidens from Stilgar, the Fremen!""As I love you both, I must speak," Stilgar said, a profound dignity in his tone."I did not become a chieftain among the Fremen by being blind to what moves men and women together.One needs no mysterious powers for this. "Paul weighed Stilgar's meaning, reviewed what they had seen here and his own undeniable male reaction to his own sister.Yes   there'd been a ruttish air about Alia, something wildly wanton.What had made her enter the practice floor in the nude?And risking her life in that foolhardy way!Eleven lights in the fencing prisms!That brainless automaton loomed in his mind with all the aspects of an ancient horror creature.Its possession was the shibboleth of this age, but it carried also the taint of old immorality.Once, they'd been guided by an artificial intelligence, computer brains.The Butlerian Jihad had ended that, but it hadn't ended the aura of aristocratic vice which enclosed such things.Stilgar was right, of course.They must find a mate for Alia."I will see to it," Paul said."Alia and I will discuss this later   privately. "Alia turned around, focused on Paul.Knowing how his mind worked, she realized she'd been the subject of a mentat decision, uncounted bits falling together in that human computer analysis.There was an inexorable quality to this realization   a movement like the movement of planets.It carried something of the order of the universe in it, inevitable and terrifying."Sire," Stilgar said, "perhaps we'd   "  "Not now!"Paul snapped."We've other problems at the moment. "Aware that she dared not try to match logic with her brother, Alia put the past few moments aside, Bene Gesserit fashion, said: "Irulan sent you?"She found herself experiencing menace in that thought."Indirectly," Paul said."The information she gives us confirms our suspicion that the Guild is about to try for a sandworm. ""They'll try to capture a small one and attempt to start the spice cycle on some other world," Stilgar said."It means they've found a world they consider suitable. ""It means they have Fremen accomplices!"Alia argued."No offworlder could capture a worm!""That goes without saying," Stilgar said."No, it doesn't," Alia said.She was outraged by such obtuseness."Paul, certainly you... ""The rot is setting in," Paul said."We've known that for quite some time."I've never seen this other world, though, and that bothers me.If they   "  "That bothers you?"Alia demanded."It means only that they've clouded its location with Steersmen the way they hide their sanctuaries. "Stilgar opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.He had the overwhelming sensation that his idols had admitted blasphemous weakness.Paul, sensing Stilgar's disquiet, said: "We've an immediate problem!I want your opinion, Alia.Stilgar suggests we expand our patrols in the open bled and reinforce the sietch watch.It's just possible we could spot a landing party and prevent the   "  "With a Steersman guiding them?"Alia asked."They are desperate, aren't they?"Paul agreed."That is why I'm here. ""What've they seen that we haven't?"Alia asked."Precisely. "Alia nodded, remembering her thoughts about the new Dune Tarot.Quickly, she recounted her fears."Throwing a blanket over us," Paul said."With adequate patrols," Stilgar ventured, "we might prevent the   "  "We prevent nothing...forever," Alia said.She didn't like the feel of the way Stilgar's mind was working now.He had narrowed his scope, eliminated obvious essentials.This was not the Stilgar she remembered."We must count on their getting a worm," Paul said."Whether they can start the melange cycle on another planet is a different question.They'll need more than a worm. "Stilgar looked from brother to sister.Out of ecological thinking that had been ground into him by sietch life, he grasped their meaning.A captive worm couldn't live except within a bit of Arrakis   sand plankton, Little Makers and all.The Guild's problem was large, but not impossible.His own growing uncertainty lay in a different area."Then your visions do not detect the Guild at its work?"he asked."Damnation!"Paul exploded.Alia studied Stilgar, sensing the savage sideshow of ideas taking place in his mind.He was hung on a rack of enchantment.Magic!Magic!To glimpse the future was to steal terrifying fire from a sacred flame.It held the attraction of ultimate peril, souls ventured and lost.One brought back from the formless, dangerous distances something with form and power.But Stilgar was beginning to sense other forces, perhaps greater powers beyond that unknown horizon.His Queen Witch and Sorcerer Friend betrayed dangerous weaknesses."Stilgar," Alia said, fighting to hold him, "you stand in a valley between dunes.I stand on the crest.I see where you do not see.And, among other things, I see mountains which conceal the distances. ""There are things hidden from you," Stilgar said."This you've always said. ""All power is limited," Alia said."And danger may come from behind the mountains," Stilgar said."It's something on that order," Alia said.Stilgar nodded, his gaze fastened on Paul's face."But whatever comes from behind the mountains must cross the dunes. "= = = = = =   The most dangerous game in the universe is to govern from an oracular base.We do not consider ourselves wise enough or brave enough to play that game.The measures detailed here for regulation in lesser matters are as near as we dare venture to the brink of government.For our purposes, we borrow a definition from the Bene Gesserit and we consider the various worlds as gene pools, sources of teachings and teachers, sources of the possible.Our goal is not to rule, but to tap these gene pools, to learn, and to free ourselves from all restraints imposed by dependency and government."The Orgy as a Tool of Statecraft," Chapter Three of The Steersman's Guild   "Is that where your father died?"Edric asked, sending a beam pointer from his tank to a jeweled marker on one of the relief maps adorning a wall of Paul's reception salon."That's the shrine of his skull," Paul said."My father died a prisoner on a Harkonnen frigate in the sink below us. ""Oh, yes: I recall the story now," Edric said."Something about killing the old Baron Harkonnen, his mortal enemy. "Hoping he didn't betray too much of the terror which small enclosures such as this room imposed upon him, Edric rolled over in the orange gas, directed his gaze at Paul, who sat alone on a long divan of striped gray and black."My sister killed the Baron," Paul said, voice and manner dry, "just before the battle of Arrakeen. "And why, he wondered, did the Guild man fish reopen old wounds in this place and at this time?The Steersman appeared to be fighting a losing battle to contain his nervous energies.Gone were the languid fish motions of their earlier encounter.Edric's tiny eyes jerked here...there, questing and measuring.The one attendant who had accompanied him in here stood apart near the line of houseguards ranging the end wall at Paul's left.The attendant worried Paul   hulking, thick necked, blunt and vacant face.The man had entered the salon, nudging Edric's tank along on its supporting field, walking with a strangler's gait, arms akimbo.Scytale, Edric had called him.Scytale, an aide.The aide's surface shouted stupidity, but the eyes betrayed him.They laughed at everything they saw."Your concubine appeared to enjoy the performance of the Face Dancers," Edric said."It pleases me that I could provide that small entertainment.I particularly enjoyed her reaction to seeing her own features simultaneously repeated by the whole troupe. ""Isn't there a warning against Guildsmen bearing gifts?"Paul asked.And he thought of the performance out there in the Great Hall.The dancers had entered in the costumes and guise of the Dune Tarot, flinging themselves about in seemingly random patterns that devolved into fire eddies and ancient prognostic designs.Then had come the rulers   a parade of kings and emperors like faces on coins, formal and stiff in outline, but curiously fluid.And the jokes: a copy of Paul's own face and body, Chani repeated across the floor of the Hall, even Stilgar, who had grunted and shuddered while others laughed."But our gifts have the kindest intent," Edric protested."How kindly can you be?"Paul asked."The ghola you gave us believes he was designed to destroy us. ""Destroy you, Sire?"Edric asked, all bland attention."Can one destroy a god?"Stilgar, entering on the last words, stopped, glared at the guards.They were much farther from Paul than he liked.Angrily he motioned them closer."It's all right, Stil," Paul said, lifting a hand."Just a friendly discussion.Why don't you move the Ambassador's tank over by the end of my divan?"Stilgar, weighing the order, saw that it would put the Steersman's tank between Paul and the hulking aide, much too close to Paul, but..."It's all right, Stil," Paul repeated, and he gave the private hand signal which made the order an imperative.Moving with obvious reluctance, Stilgar pushed the tank closer to Paul.He didn't like the feel of the container or the heavily perfumed smell of melange around it.He took up a position at the corner of the tank beneath the orbiting device through which the Steersman spoke."To kill a god," Paul said."That's very interesting.But who says I'm a god?""Those who worship you," Edric said, glancing pointedly at Stilgar."Is this what you believe?"Paul asked."What I believe is of no moment, Sire," Edric said."It seems to most observers, however, that you conspire to make a god of yourself.And one might ask if that is something any mortal can do...safely?"Paul studied the Guildsman.Repellent creature, but perceptive.It was a question Paul had asked himself time and again.But he had seen enough alternate Timelines to know of worse possibilities than accepting godhead for himself.Much worse.These were not, however, the normal avenues for a Steersman to probe.Curious.Why had that question been asked?What could Edric hope to gain by such effrontery?Paul's thoughts went flick (the association of Tleilaxu would be behind this move)   flick (the Jihad's recent Sembou victory would bear on Edric's action)   flick (various Bene Gesserit credos showed themselves here) flick...A process involving thousands of information bits poured flickering through his computational awareness.It required perhaps three seconds."Does a Steersman question the guidelines of prescience?"Paul asked, putting Edric on the weakest ground.This disturbed the Steersman, but he covered well, coming up with what sounded like a long aphorism: "No man of intelligence questions the fact of prescience, Sire.Oracular vision has been known to men since most ancient times.It has a way of entangling us when we least suspect.Luckily, there are other forces in our universe. ""Greater than prescience?"Paul asked, pressing him."If prescience alone existed and did everything, Sire, it would annihilate itself.Nothing but prescience?Where could it be applied except to its own degenerating movements?""There's always the human situation," Paul agreed."A precarious thing at best," Edric said, "without confusing it by hallucinations. ""Are my visions no more than hallucinations?"Paul asked, mock sadness in his voice."Or do you imply that my worshippers hallucinate?"Stilgar, sensing the mounting tensions, moved a step nearer Paul, fixed his attention on the Guildsman reclining in the tank."You twist my words, Sire," Edric protested.An odd sense of violence lay suspended in the words.Violence here?Paul wondered.They wouldn't dare!Unless (and he glanced at his guards) the forces which protected him were to be used in replacing him."But you accuse me of conspiring to make a god of myself," Paul said, pitching his voice that only Edric and Stilgar might hear."Conspire?""A poor choice of words, perhaps, my Lord," Edric said."But significant," Paul said."It says you expect the worst of me. "Edric arched his neck, stared sideways at Stilgar with a look of apprehension."People always expect the worst of the rich and powerful, Sire.It is said one can always tell an aristocrat: he reveals only those of his vices which will make him popular. "A tremor passed across Stilgar's face.Paul looked up at the movement, sensing the thoughts and angers whispering in Stilgar's mind.How dared this Guildsman talk thus to Muad'dib?"You're not joking, of course," Paul said."Joking, Sire?"Paul grew aware of dryness in his mouth.He felt that there were too many people in this room, that the air he breathed had passed through too many lungs.The taint of melange from Edric's tank felt threatening."Who might my accomplices be in such a conspiracy?"Paul asked presently."Do you nominate the Qizarate?"Edric's shrug stirred the orange gas around his head.He no longer appeared concerned by Stilgar, although the Fremen continued to glare at him."Are you suggesting that my missionaries of the Holy Orders, all of them, are preaching subtle falsehood?"Paul insisted."It could be a question of self interest and sincerity," Edric said.Stilgar put a hand to the crysknife beneath his robe.Paul shook his head, said: "Then you accuse me of insincerity. ""I'm not sure that accuse is the proper word, Sire. "The boldness of this creature!Paul thought.And he said: "Accused or not, you're saying my bishops and I are no better than power hungry brigands. ""Power hungry, Sire?"Again, Edric looked at Stilgar."Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it.Eventually, they lose touch with reality...and fall. ""M'Lord," Stilgar growled, "you've had men executed for less!""Men, yes," Paul agreed."But this is a Guild Ambassador. ""He accuses you of an unholy fraud!"Stilgar said."His thinking interests me, Stil," Paul said."Contain your anger and remain alert. ""As Muad'dib commands. ""Tell me, Steersman," Paul said, "how could we maintain this hypothetical fraud over such enormous distances of space and time without the means to watch every missionary, to examine every nuance in every Qizarate priory and temple?""What is time to you?"Edric asked.Stilgar frowned in obvious puzzlement.And he thought: Muad'dib has often said he sees past the veils of time.What is the Guildsman really saying?"Wouldn't the structure of such a fraud begin to show holes?"Paul asked."Significant disagreements, schisms...doubts, confessions of guilt   surely fraud could not suppress all these. ""What religion and self interest cannot hide, governments can," Edric said."Are you testing the limits of my tolerance?"Paul asked."Do my arguments lack all merit?"Edric countered.Does he want us to kill him?Paul wondered.Is Edric offering himself as a sacrifice?"I prefer the cynical view," Paul said, testing."You obviously are trained in all the lying tricks of statecraft, the double meanings and the power words.Language is nothing more than a weapon to you and, thus, you test my armor. ""The cynical view," Edric said, a smile stretching his mouth."And rulers are notoriously cynical where religions are concerned.Religion, too, is a weapon.What manner of weapon is religion when it becomes the government?"Paul felt himself go inwardly still, a profound caution gripping him.To whom was Edric speaking?Damnable clever words, heavy with manipulation leverages   that undertone of comfortable humor, the unspoken air of shared Secrets: his manner said he and Paul were two sophisticates, men of a wider universe who understood things not granted common folk.With a feeling of shock, Paul realized that he had not been the main target for all this rhetoric.This affliction visited upon the court had been speaking for the benefit of others   speaking to Stilgar, to the household guards...perhaps even to the hulking aide."Religious mana was thrust upon me," Paul said."I did not seek it. "And he thought: There!Let this man fish think himself victorious in our battle of words!"Then why have you not disavowed it, Sire?"Edric asked."Because of my sister Alia," Paul said, watching Edric carefully."She is a goddess.Let me urge caution where Alia is concerned lest she strike you dead with her glance. "A gloating smile began forming on Edric's mouth, was replaced by a look of shock."I am deadly serious," Paul said, watching the shock spread, seeing Stilgar nod.In a bleak voice, Edric said: "You have mauled my confidence in you, Sire.And no doubt that was your intent. ""Do not be certain you know my intent," Paul said, and he signaled Stilgar that the audience was at an end.To Stilgar's questioning gesture asking if Edric were to be assassinated, Paul gave a negative hand sign, amplified it with an imperative lest Stilgar take matters into his own hands.Scytale, Edric's aide, moved to the rear corner of the tank, nudged it toward the door.When he came opposite Paul, he stopped, turned that laughing gaze on Paul, said: "If my Lord permits?""Yes, what is it?"Paul asked, noting how Stilgar moved close in answer to the implied menace from this man."Some say," Scytale said, "that people cling to Imperial leadership because space is infinite.They feel lonely without a unifying symbol.For a lonely people, the Emperor is a definite place.They can turn toward him and say: 'See, there He is.He makes us one. 'Perhaps religion serves the same purpose, m'Lord. "Scytale nodded pleasantly, gave Edric's tank another nudge.They moved out of the salon, Edric supine in his tank, eyes closed.The Steersman appeared spent, all his nervous energies exhausted.Paul stared after the shambling figure of Scytale, wondering at the man's words.A peculiar fellow, that Scytale, he thought.While he was speaking, he had radiated a feeling of many people   as though his entire genetic inheritance lay exposed on his skin."That was odd," Stilgar said, speaking to no one in particular.Paul arose from the divan as a guard closed the door behind Edric and the escort."Odd," Stilgar repeated.A vein throbbed at his temple.Paul dimmed the salon's lights, moved to a window which opened onto an angled cliff of his Keep.Lights glittered far below   pigmy movement.A work gang moved down there bringing giant plasmeld blocks to repair a facade of Alia's temple which had been damaged by a freak twisting of a sandblast wind."That was a foolish thing, Usul, inviting that creature into these chambers," Stilgar said.Usul, Paul thought.My sietch name.Stilgar reminds me that he ruled over me once, that he saved me from the desert."Why did you do it?"Stilgar asked, speaking from close behind Paul."Data," Paul said."I need more data. ""Is it not dangerous to try meeting this threat only as a mentat?"That was perceptive, Paul thought.Mentat computation remained finite.You couldn't say something boundless within the boundaries of any language.Mentat abilities had their uses, though.He said as much now, daring Stilgar to refute his argument."There's always something outside," Stilgar said."Some things best kept outside. ""Or inside," Paul said.And he accepted for a moment his own oracular/mentat summation.Outside, yes.And inside: here lay the true horror.How could he protect himself from himself?They certainly were setting him up to destroy himself, but this was a position hemmed in by even more terrifying possibilities.His reverie was broken by the sound of rapid footsteps.The figure of Korba the Qizara surged through the doorway backlighted by the brilliant illumination in the hallways.He entered as though hurled by an unseen force and came to an almost immediate halt when he encountered the salon's gloom.His hands appeared to be full of shigawire reels.They glittered in the light from the hall, strange little round jewels that were extinguished as a guardsman's hand came into view, closed the door."Is that you, m'Lord?"Korba asked, peering into the shadows."What is it?"Stilgar asked."Stilgar?""We're both here.What is it?""I'm disturbed by this reception for the Guildsman. ""Disturbed?"Paul asked."The people say, m'Lord, that you honor our enemies. ""Is that all?"Paul said."Are those the reels I asked you to bring earlier?"He indicated the shigawire orbs in Korba's hands."Reels...oh!Yes, m'Lord.These are the histories.Will you view them here?""I've viewed them.I want them for Stilgar here. ""For me?"Stilgar asked.He felt resentment grow at what he interpreted as caprice on Paul's part.Histories!Stilgar had sought out Paul earlier to discuss the logistics computations for the Zabulon conquest.The Guild Ambassador's presence had intervened.And now   Korba with histories!"How much history do you know?"Paul mused aloud, studying the shadowy figure beside him."M'Lord, I can name every world our people touched in their migrations.I know the reaches of Imperial... ""The Golden Age of Earth, have you ever studied that?""Earth?Golden Age?"Stilgar was irritated and puzzled.Why would Paul wish to discuss myths from the dawn of time?Stilgar's mind still felt crammed with Zabulon data   computations from the staff mentats: two hundred and five attack frigates with thirty legions, support battalions, pacification cadres, Qizarate missionaries...the food requirements (he had the figures right here in his mind) and melange...weaponry, uniforms, medals...urns for the ashes of the dead...the number of specialists   men to produce raw materials of propaganda, clerks, accountants...spies...and spies upon the spies..."I brought the pulse synchronizer attachment, also, m'Lord," Korba ventured.He obviously sensed the tensions building between Paul and Stilgar and was disturbed by them.Stilgar shook his head from side to side.Pulse synchronizer?Why would Paul wish him to use a mnemonic flutter system on a shigawire projector?Why scan for specific data in histories?This was mentat work!As usual, Stilgar found he couldn't escape a deep suspicion at the thought of using a projector and attachments.The thing always immersed him in disturbing sensations, an overwhelming shower of data which his mind sorted out later, surprising him with information he had not known he possessed."Sire, I came with the Zabulon computations," Stilgar said."Dehydrate the Zabulon computations!"Paul snapped, using the obscene Fremen term which meant that here was moisture no man could demean himself by touching."M'Lord!""Stilgar," Paul said, "you urgently need a sense of balance which can come only from an understanding of long term effects.What little information we have about the old times, the pittance of data which the Butlerians left us, Korba has brought it for you.Start with the Genghis Khan. ""Ghengis...Khan?Was he of the Sardaukar, m'Lord?""Oh, long before that.He killed...perhaps four million. ""He must've had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire.Lasbeams, perhaps, or... ""He didn't kill them himself, Stil.He killed the way I kill, by sending out his legions.There's another emperor I want you to note in passing   a Hitler.He killed more than six million.Pretty good for those days. ""Killed...by his legions?"Stilgar asked."Yes. ""Not very impressive statistics, m'Lord. ""Very good, Stil. "Paul glanced at the reels in Korba's hands.Korba stood with them as though he wished he could drop them and flee."Statistics: at a conservative estimate, I've killed sixty one billion, sterilized ninety planets, completely demoralized five hundred others.I've wiped out the followers of forty religions which had existed since   "  "Unbelievers!"Korba protested."Unbelievers all!""No," Paul said."Believers. ""My Liege makes a joke," Korba said, voice trembling."The Jihad has brought ten thousand worlds into the shining light of   "  "Into the darkness," Paul said."We'll be a hundred generations recovering from Muad'dib's Jihad.I find it hard to imagine that anyone will ever surpass this. "A barking laugh erupted from his throat."What amuses Muad'dib?"Stilgar asked."I am not amused.I merely had a sudden vision of the Emperor Hitler saying something similar.No doubt he did. ""No other ruler ever had your powers," Korba argued."Who would dare challenge you?Your legions control the known universe and all the   "  "The legions control," Paul said."I wonder if they know this?""You control your legions, Sire," Stilgar interrupted, and it was obvious from the tone of his voice that he suddenly felt his own position in that chain of command, his own hand guiding all that power.Having set Stilgar's thoughts in motion along the track he wanted, Paul turned his full attention to Korba, said: "Put the reels here on the divan. "As Korba obeyed, Paul said: "How goes the reception, Korba?Does my sister have everything well in hand?""Yes, m'Lord. "Korba's tone was wary."And Chani watches from the spy hole.She suspects there may be Sardaukar in the Guild entourage. ""No doubt she's correct," Paul said."The jackals gather. ""Bannerjee," Stilgar said, naming the chief of Paul's Security detail, "was worried earlier that some of them might try to penetrate the private areas of the Keep. ""Have they?""Not yet. ""But there was some confusion in the formal gardens," Korba said."What sort of confusion?"Stilgar demanded.Paul nodded."Strangers coming and going," Korba said, "trampling the plants, whispered conversations   I heard reports of some disturbing remarks. ""Such as?"Paul asked."Is this the way our taxes are spent?I'm told the Ambassador himself asked that question. ""I don't find that surprising," Paul said."Were there many strangers in the gardens?""Dozens, m'Lord. ""Bannerjee stationed picked troopers at the vulnerable doors, m'Lord," Stilgar said.He turned as he spoke, allowing the salon's single remaining light to illuminate half his face.The peculiar lighting, the face, all touched a node of memory in Paul's mind   something from the desert.Paul didn't bother bringing it to full recall, his attention being focused on how Stilgar had pulled back mentally.The Fremen had a tight skinned forehead which mirrored almost every thought flickering across his mind.He was suspicious now, profoundly suspicious of his Emperor's odd behavior."I don't like the intrusion into the gardens," Paul said."Courtesy to guests is one thing, and the formal necessities of greeting an envoy, but this...  ""I'll see to removing them," Korba said."Immediately. ""Wait!"Paul ordered as Korba started to turn.In the abrupt stillness of the moment, Stilgar edged himself into a position where he could study Paul's face.It was deftly done.Paul admired the way of it, an achievement devoid of any forwardness.It was a Fremen thing: slyness touched by respect for another's privacy, a movement of necessity."What time is it?"Paul asked."Almost midnight, Sire," Korba said."Korba, I think you may be my finest creation," Paul said."Sire!"There was injury in Korba's voice."Do you feel awe of me?"Paul asked."You are Paul Muad'dib who was Usul in our sietch," Korba said."You know my devotion to   "  "Have you ever felt like an apostle?"Paul asked.Korba obviously misunderstood the words, but correctly interpreted the tone."My Emperor knows I have a clean conscience!""Shai hulud save us," Paul murmured.The questioning silence of the moment was broken by the sound of someone whistling as he walked down the outer hall.The whistling was stilled by a guardsman's barked command as it came opposite the door."Korba, I think you may survive all this," Paul said.And he read the growing light of understanding on Stilgar's face."The strangers in the gardens, Sire?"Stilgar asked."Ahh, yes," Paul said."Have Bannerjee put them out, Stil.Korba will assist. ""Me, Sire?"Korba betrayed deep disquiet."Some of my friends have forgotten they once were Fremen," Paul said, speaking to Korba, but designing his words for Stilgar."You will mark down the ones Chani identifies as Sardaukar and you will have them killed.Do it yourself.I want it done quietly and without undue disturbance.We must keep in mind that there's more to religion and government than approving treaties and sermons. ""I obey the orders of Muad'dib," Korba whispered."The Zabulon computations?"Stilgar asked."Tomorrow," Paul said."And when the strangers are removed from the gardens, announce that the reception is ended.The party's over, Stil. ""I understand, m'Lord. ""I'm sure you do," Paul said.= = = = = =   Here lies a toppled god   His fall was not a small one.We did but build his pedestal, A narrow and a tall one.Tleilaxu Epigram   Alia crouched, resting elbows on knees, chin on fists, stared at the body on the dune   a few bones and some tattered flesh that once had been a young woman.The hands, the head, most of the upper torso were gone   eaten by the coriolis wind.The sand all around bore the tracks of her brother's medics and questors.They were gone now, all excepting the mortuary attendants who stood to one side with Hayt, the ghola, waiting for her to finish her mysterious perusal of what had been written here.A wheat colored sky enfolded the scene in the glaucous light common to midafternoon for these latitudes.The body had been discovered several hours earlier by a low flying courier whose instruments had detected a faint water trace where none should be.His call had brought the experts.And they had learned   what?That this had been a woman of about twenty years, Fremen, addicted to semuta...and she had died here in the crucible of the desert from the effects of a subtle poison of Tleilaxu origin.To die in the desert was a common enough occurrence.But a Fremen addicted to semuta, this was such a rarity that Paul had sent her to examine the scene in the ways their mother had taught them.Alia felt that she had accomplished nothing here except to cast her own aura of mystery about a scene that was already mysterious enough.She heard the ghola's feet stir the sand, looked at him.His attention rested momentarily upon the escort 'thopters circling overhead like a flock of ravens.Beware of the Guild bearing gifts, Alia thought.The mortuary 'thopter and her own craft stood on the sand near a rock outcropping behind the ghola.Focusing on the grounded 'thopters filled Alia with a craving to be airborne and away from here.But Paul had thought she might see something here which others would miss.She squirmed in her stillsuit.It felt raspingly unfamiliar after all the suitless months of city life.She studied the ghola, wondering if he might know something important about this peculiar death.A lock of his black goat hair, she saw, had escaped his stillsuit hood.She sensed her hand longing to tuck that hair back into place.As though lured by this thought, his gleaming gray metal eyes turned toward her.The eyes set her trembling and she tore her gaze away from him.A Fremen woman had died here from a poison called "the throat of hell. "A Fremen addicted to semuta.She shared Paul's disquiet at this conjunction.The mortuary attendants waited patiently.This corpse contained not enough water for them to salvage.They felt no need to hurry.And they'd believe that Alia, through some glyptic art, was reading a strange truth in these remains.No strange truth came to her.There was only a distant feeling of anger deep within her at the obvious thoughts in the attendants' minds.It was a product of the damned religious mystery.She and her brother could not be people.They had to be something more.The Bene Gesserit had seen to that by manipulating Atreides ancestry.Their mother had contributed to it by thrusting them onto the path of witchery.And Paul perpetuated the difference.The Reverend Mothers encapsulated in Alia's memories stirred restlessly, provoking adab flashes of thought: "Peace, Little One!You are what you are.There are compensations. "Compensations!She summoned the ghola with a gesture.He stopped beside her, attentive, patient."What do you see in this?"she asked."We may never learn who it was died here," he said."The head, the teeth are gone.The hands...Unlikely such a one had a genetic record somewhere to which her cells could be matched. ""Tleilaxu poison," she said."What do you make of that?""Many people buy such poisons. ""True enough.And this flesh is too far gone to be regrown as was done with your body. ""Even if you could trust the Tleilaxu to do it," he said.She nodded, stood."You will fly me back to the city now. "When they were airborne and pointed north, she said: "You fly exactly as Duncan Idaho did. "He cast a speculative glance at her."Others have told me this. ""What are you thinking now?"she asked."Many things. ""Stop dodging my question, damn you!""Which question?"She glared at him.He saw the glare, shrugged.How like Duncan Idaho, that gesture, she thought.Accusingly, her voice thick and with a catch in it, she said: "I merely wanted your reactions voiced to play my own thoughts against them.That young woman's death bothers me. ""I was not thinking about that. ""What were you thinking about?""About the strange emotions I feel when people speak of the one I may have been. ""May have been?""The Tleilaxu are very clever. ""Not that clever.You were Duncan Idaho. ""Very likely.It's the prime computation. ""So you get emotional?""To a degree.I feel eagerness.I'm uneasy.There's a tendency to tremble and I must devote effort to controlling it.I get...flashes of imagery. ""What imagery?""It's too rapid to recognize.Flashes.Spasms...almost memories. ""Aren't you curious about such memories?""Of course.Curiosity urges me forward, but I move against a heavy reluctance.I think: 'What if I'm not the one they believe me to be?'I don't like that thought. ""And this is all you were thinking?""You know better than that, Alia. "How dare he use my given name?She felt anger rise and go down beneath the memory of the way he'd spoken: softly throbbing undertones, casual male confidence.A muscle twitched along her jaw.She clenched her teeth."Isn't that El Kuds down there?"he asked, dipping a wing briefly, causing a sudden flurry in their escort.She looked down at their shadows rippling across the promontory above Harg Pass, at the cliff and the rock pyramid containing the skull of her father.El Kuds   the Holy Place."That's the Holy Place," she said."I must visit that place one day," he said."Nearness to your father's remains may bring memories I can capture. "She saw suddenly how strong must be this need to know who he'd been.It was a central compulsion with him.She looked back at the rocks, the cliff with its base sloping into a dry beach and a sea of sand   cinnamon rock lifting from the dunes like a ship breasting waves."Circle back," she said."The escort...  ""They'll follow.Swing under them. "He obeyed."Do you truly serve my brother?"she asked, when he was on the new course, the escort following."I serve the Atreides," he said, his tone formal.And she saw his right hand lift, fall   almost the old salute of Caladan.A pensive look came over his face.She watched him peer down at the rock pyramid."What bothers you?"she asked.His lips moved.A voice emerged, brittle, tight: "He was...he was... "A tear slid down his cheek.Alia found herself stilled by Fremen awe.He gave water to the dead!Compulsively, she touched a finger to his cheek, felt the tear."Duncan," she whispered.He appeared locked to the 'thopter's controls, gaze fastened to the tomb below.She raised her voice: "Duncan!"He swallowed, shook his head, looked at her, the metal eyes glistening."I. ..felt...an arm...on my shoulders," he whispered."I felt it!An arm. "His throat worked."It was...a friend.It was...my friend. ""Who?""I don't know.I think it was...I don't know. "The call light began flashing in front of Alia, their escort captain wanting to know why they returned to the desert.She took the microphone, explained that they had paid a brief homage to her father's tomb.The captain reminded her that it was late."We will go to Arrakeen now," she said, replacing the microphone.Hayt took a deep breath, banked their 'thopter around to the north."It was my father's arm you felt, wasn't it?"she asked."Perhaps. "His voice was that of the mentat computing probabilities, and she saw he had regained his composure."Are you aware of how I know my father?"she asked."I have some idea. ""Let me make it clear," she said.Briefly, she explained how she had awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before birth, a terrified fetus with the knowledge of countless lives embedded in her nerve cells   and all this after the death of her father."I know my father as my mother knew him," she said."In every last detail of every experience she shared with him.In a way, I am my mother.I have all her memories up to the moment when she drank the Water of Life and entered the trance of transmigration. ""Your brother explained something of this. ""He did?Why?""I asked. ""Why?""A mentat requires data. ""Oh. "She looked down at the flat expanse of the Shield Wall   tortured rock, pits and crevices.He saw the direction of her gaze, said: "A very exposed place, that down there. ""But an easy place to hide," she said.She looked at him."It reminds me of a human mind...
