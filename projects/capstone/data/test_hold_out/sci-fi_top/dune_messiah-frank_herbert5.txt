with all its concealments. ""Ahhh," he said."Ahhh?What does that mean   ahhh?"She was suddenly angry with him and the reason for it escaped her."You'd like to know what my mind conceals," he said.It was a statement, not a question."How do you know I haven't exposed you for what you are by my powers of prescience?"she demanded."Have you?"He seemed genuinely curious."No!""Sibyls have limits," he said.He appeared to be amused and this reduced Alia's anger."Amused?Have you no respect for my powers?"she asked.The question sounded weakly argumentative even to her own ears."I respect your omens and portents perhaps more than you think," he said."I was in the audience for your Morning Ritual. ""And what does that signify?""You've great ability with symbols," he said, keeping his attention on the 'thopter's controls."That's a Bene Gesserit thing, I'd say.But, as with many witches, you've become careless of your powers. "She felt a spasm of fear, blared: "How dare you?""I dare much more than my makers anticipated," he said."Because of that rare fact, I remain with your brother. "Alia studied the steel balls which were his eyes: no human expression there.The stillsuit hood concealed the line of his jaw.His mouth remained firm, though.Great strength in it...and determination.His words had carried a reassuring intensity."...dare much more...  "That was a thing Duncan Idaho might have said.Had the Tleilaxu fashioned their ghola better than they knew   or was this mere sham, part of his conditioning?"Explain yourself, ghola," she commanded."Know thyself, is that thy commandment?"he asked.Again, she felt that he was amused."Don't bandy words with me, you...you thing!"she said.She put a hand to the crysknife in its throat sheath."Why were you given to my brother?""Your brother tells me that you watched the presentation," he said."You've heard me answer that question for him. ""Answer it again...for me!""I am intended to destroy him. ""Is that the mentat speaking?""You know the answer to that without asking," he chided."And you know, as well, that such a gift wasn't necessary.Your brother already was destroying himself quite adequately. "She weighed these words, her hand remaining on the haft of her knife.A tricky answer, but there was sincerity in the voice."Then why such a gift?"she probed."It may have amused the Tleilaxu.And, it is true, that the Guild asked for me as a gift. ""Why?""Same answer. ""How am I careless of my powers?""How are you employing them?"he countered.His question slashed through to her own misgivings.She took her hand away from the knife, asked: "Why do you say my brother was destroying himself?""Oh, come now, child!Where are these vaunted powers?Have you no ability to reason?"Controlling anger, she said: "Reason for me, mentat. ""Very well. "He glanced around at their escort, returned his attention to their course.The plain of Arrakeen was beginning to show beyond the northern rim of the Shield Wall.The pattern of the pan and graben villages remained indistinct beneath a dust pall, but the distant gleam of Arrakeen could be discerned."Symptoms," he said."Your brother keeps an official Panegyrist who   "  "Who was a gift of the Fremen Naibs!""An odd gift from friends," he said."Why would they surround him with flattery and servility?Have you really listened to this Panegyrist?'The people are illuminated by Muad'dib.The Umma Regent, our Emperor, came out of darkness to shine resplendently upon all men.He is our Sire.He is precious water from an endless fountain.He spills joy for all the universe to drink,' Pah!"Speaking softly, Alia said: "If I but repeated your words for our Fremen escort, they'd hack you into bird feed. ""Then tell them. ""My brother rules by the natural law of heaven!""You don't believe that, so why say it?""How do you know what I believe?"She experienced trembling that no Bene Gesserit powers could control.This ghola was having an effect she hadn't anticipated."You commanded me to reason as a mentat," he reminded her."No mentat knows what I believe!"She took two deep, shuddering breaths."How dare you judge us?""Judge you?I don't judge. ""You've no idea how we were taught!""Both of you were taught to govern," he said."You were conditioned to an overweening thirst for power.You were imbued with a shrewd grasp of politics and a deep understanding for the uses of war and ritual.Natural law?What natural law?That myth haunts human history.Haunts!It's a ghost.It's insubstantial, unreal.Is your Jihad a natural law?""Mentat jabber," she sneered."I'm a servant of the Atreides and I speak with candor," he said."Servant?We've no servants; only disciples. ""And I am a disciple of awareness," he said."Understand that, child, and you   "  "Don't call me child!"she snapped.She slipped her crysknife half out of its sheath."I stand corrected. "He glanced at her, smiled, returned his attention to piloting the 'thopter.The cliffsided structure of the Atreides Keep could be made out now, dominating the northern suburbs of Arrakeen."You are something ancient in flesh that is little more than a child," he said."And the flesh is disturbed by its new womanhood. ""I don't know why I listen to you," she growled, but she let the crysknife fall back into its sheath, wiped her palm on her robe.The palm, wet with perspiration, disturbed her sense of Fremen frugality.Such a waste of the body's moisture!"You listen because you know I'm devoted to your brother," he said."My actions are clear and easily understood. ""Nothing about you is clear and easily understood.You're the most complex creature I've ever seen.How do I know what the Tleilaxu built into you?""By mistake or intent," he said, "they gave me freedom to mold myself. ""You retreat into Zensunni parables," she accused."The wise man molds himself   the fool lives only to die. "Her voice was heavy with mimicry."Disciple of awareness!""Men cannot separate means and enlightenment," he said."You speak riddles!""I speak to the opening mind. ""I'm going to repeat all this to Paul. ""He's heard most of it already. "She found herself overwhelmed by curiosity."How is it you're still alive...and free?What did he say?""He laughed.And he said, 'People don't want a bookkeeper for an Emperor; they want a master, someone who'll protect them from change. 'But he agreed that destruction of his Empire arises from himself. ""Why would he say such things?""Because I convinced him I understand his problem and will help him. ""What could you possibly have said to do that?"He remained silent, banking the 'thopter into the downwind leg for a landing at the guard complex on the roof of the Keep."I demand you tell me what you said!""I'm not sure you could take it. ""I'll be the judge of that!I command you to speak at once!""Permit me to land us first," he said.And not waiting for her permission, he turned onto the base leg, brought the wings into optimum lift, settled gently onto the bright orange pad atop the roof."Now," Alia said."Speak. ""I told him that to endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe. "She shook her head."That's...that's...  ""A bitter pill," he said, watching the guards run toward them across the roof, taking up their escort positions."Bitter nonsense!""The greatest palatinate earl and the lowliest stipendiary serf share the same problem.You cannot hire a mentat or any other intellect to solve it for you.There's no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers.No servant   or disciple   can dress the wound.You dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see. "She whirled away from him, realizing in the instant of action what this betrayed about her own feelings.Without wile of voice or witch wrought trickery, he had reached into her psyche once more.How did he do this?"What have you told him to do?"she whispered."I told him to judge, to impose order. "Alia stared out at the guard, marking how patiently they waited   how orderly."To dispense justice," she murmured."Not that!"he snapped."I suggested that he judge, no more, guided by one principle, perhaps... ""And that?""To keep his friends and destroy his enemies. ""To judge unjustly, then. ""What is justice?Two forces collide.Each may have the right in his own sphere.And here's where an Emperor commands orderly solutions.Those collisions he cannot prevent   he solves. ""How?""In the simplest way: he decides. ""Keeping his friends and destroying his enemies. ""Isn't that stability?People want order, this kind or some other.They sit in the prison of their hungers and see that war has become the sport of the rich.That's a dangerous form of sophistication.It's disorderly. ""I will suggest to my brother that you are much too dangerous and must be destroyed," she said, turning to face him."A solution I've already suggested," he said."And that's why you are dangerous," she said, measuring out her words."You've mastered your passions. ""That is not why I'm dangerous. "Before she could move, he leaned across, gripped her chin in one hand, planted his lips on hers.It was a gentle kiss, brief.He pulled away and she stared at him with a shock leavened by glimpses of spasmodic grins on the faces of her guardsmen still standing at orderly attention outside.Alia put a finger to her lips.There'd been such a sense of familiarity about that kiss.His lips had been flesh of a future she'd seen in some prescient byway.Breast heaving, she said: "I should have you flayed. ""Because I'm dangerous?""Because you presume too much!""I presume nothing.I take nothing which is not first offered to me.Be glad I did not take all that was offered. "He opened his door, slid out."Come along.We've dallied too long on a fool's errand. "He strode toward the entrance dome beyond the pad.Alia leaped out, ran to match his stride."I'll tell him everything you've said and everything you did," she said."Good. "He held the door for her."He will order you executed," she said, slipping into the dome."Why?Because I took the kiss I wanted?"He followed her, his movement forcing her back.The door slid closed behind him."The kiss you wanted!"Outrage filled her."All right, Alia.The kiss you wanted, then. "He started to move around her toward the drop field.As though his movement had propelled her into heightened awareness, she realized his candor   the utter truthfulness of him.The kiss I wanted, she told herself.True."Your truthfulness, that's what's dangerous," she said, following him."You return to the ways of wisdom," he said, not breaking his stride."A mentat could not've stated the matter more directly.Now: what is it you saw in the desert?"She grabbed his arm, forcing him to a halt.He'd done it again: shocked her mind into sharpened awareness."I can't explain it," she said, "but I keep thinking of the Face Dancers.Why is that?""That is why your brother sent you to the desert," he said, nodding."Tell him of this persistent thought. ""But why?"She shook her head."Why Face Dancers?""There's a young woman dead out there," he said."Perhaps no young woman is reported missing among the Fremen. "= = = = = =   I think what a joy it is to be alive, and I wonder if I'll ever leap inward to the root of this flesh and know myself as once I was.The root is there.Whether any act of mine can find it, that remains tangled in the future.But all things a man can do are mine.Any act of mine may do it.The Ghola Speaks Alia's Commentary   As he lay immersed in the screaming odor of the spice, staring inward through the oracular trance, Paul saw the moon become an elongated sphere.It rolled and twisted, hissing   the terrible hissing of a star being quenched in an infinite sea   down...down...down...like a ball thrown by a child.It was gone.This moon had not set.Realization engulfed him.It was gone: no moon.The earth quaked like an animal shaking its skin.Terror swept over him.Paul jerked upright on his pallet, eyes wide open, staring.Part of him looked outward, part inward.Outwardly, he saw the plasmeld grillwork which vented his private room, and he knew he lay beside a stone like abyss of his Keep.Inwardly, he continued to see the moon fall.Out!Out!His grillwork of plasmeld looked onto the blazing light of noon across Arrakeen.Inward   there lay blackest night.A shower of sweet odors from a garden roof nibbled at his senses, but no floral perfume could roll back that fallen moon.Paul swung his feet to the cold surface of the floor, peered through the grillwork.He could see directly across to the gentle arc of a footbridge constructed of crystal stabilized gold and platinum.Fire jewels from far Cedon decorated the bridge.It led to the galleries of the inner city across a pool and fountain filled with waterflowers.If he stood, Paul knew, he could look down into petals as clean and red as fresh blood whirling, turning there   disks of ambient color tossed on an emerald freshet.His eyes absorbed the scene without pulling him from spice thralldom.That terrible vision of a lost moon.The vision suggested a monstrous loss of individual security.Perhaps he'd seen his civilization fall, toppled by its own pretensions.A moon...a moon...a falling moon.It had taken a massive dose of the spice essence to penetrate the mud thrown up by the tarot.All it had shown him was a falling moon and the hateful way he'd known from the beginning.To buy an end for the Jihad, to silence the volcano of butchery, he must discredit himself.Disengage...disengage...disengage...Floral perfume from the garden roof reminded him of Chani.He longed for her arms now, for the clinging arms of love and forgetfulness.But even Chani could not exorcise this vision.What would Chani say if he went to her with the statement that he had a particular death in mind?Knowing it to be inevitable, why not choose an aristocrat's death, ending life on a secret flourish, squandering any years that might have been?To die before coming to the end of willpower, was that not an aristocrat's choice?He stood, crossed to the lapped opening in the grillwork, went out onto a balcony which looked upward to flowers and vines trailing from the garden.His mouth held the dryness of a desert march.Moon...moon   where is that moon?He thought of Alia's description, the young woman's body found in the dunes.A Fremen addicted to semuta!Everything fitted the hateful pattern.You do not take from this universe, he thought.It grants what it will.The remains of a conch shell from the seas of Mother Earth lay on a low table beside the balcony rail.He took its lustrous smoothness into his hands, tried to feel backward in Time.The pearl surface reflected glittering moons of light.He tore his gaze from it, peered upward past the garden to a sky become a conflagration   trails of rainbow dust shining in the silver sun.My Fremen call themselves "Children of the Moon," he thought.He put down the conch, strode along the balcony.Did that terrifying moon hold out hope of escape?He probed for meaning in the region of mystic communion.He felt weak, shaken, still gripped by the spice.At the north end of his plasmeld chasm, he came in sight of the lower buildings of the government warren.Foot traffic thronged the roof walks.He felt that the people moved there like a frieze against a background of doors, walls, tile designs.The people were tiles!When he blinked, he could hold them frozen in his mind.A frieze.A moon falls and is gone.A feeling came over him that the city out there had been translated into an odd symbol for his universe.The buildings he could see had been erected on the plain where his Fremen had obliterated the Sardaukar legions.Ground once trampled by battles rang now to the rushing clamor of business.Keeping to the balcony's outer edge, Paul strode around the corner.Now, his vista was a suburb where city structures lost themselves in rocks and the blowing sand of the desert.Alia's temple dominated the foreground; green and black hangings along its two thousand meter sides displayed the moon symbol of Muad'dib.A falling moon.Paul passed a hand across his forehead and eyes.The symbol metropolis oppressed him.He despised his own thoughts.Such vacillation in another would have aroused his anger.He loathed his city!Rage rooted in boredom flickered and simmered deep within him, nurtured by decisions that couldn't be avoided.He knew which path his feet must follow.He'd seen it enough times, hadn't he?Seen it!Once...long ago, he'd thought of himself as an inventor of government.But the invention had fallen into old patterns.It was like some hideous contrivance with plastic memory.Shape it any way you wanted, but relax for a moment, and it snapped into the ancient forms.Forces at work beyond his reach in human breasts eluded and defied him.Paul stared out across the rooftops.What treasures of untrammeled life lay beneath those roofs?He glimpsed leaf green places, open plantings amidst the chalk red and gold of the roofs.Green, the gift of Muad'dib and his water.Orchards and groves lay within his view   open plantings to rival those of fabled Lebanon."Muad'dib spends water like a madman," Fremen said.Paul put his hands over his eyes.The moon fell.He dropped his hands, stared at his metropolis with clarified vision.Buildings took on an aura of monstrous imperial barbarity.They stood enormous and bright beneath the northern sun.Colossi!Every extravagance of architecture a demented history could produce lay within his view: terraces of mesa proportion, squares as large as some cities, parks, premises, bits of cultured wilderness.Superb artistry abutted inexplicable prodigies of dismal tastelessness.Details impressed themselves upon him: a postern out of most ancient Baghdad...a dome dreamed in mythical Damascus...an arch from the low gravity of Atar...harmonious elevations and queer depths.All created an effect of unrivaled magnificence.A moon!A moon!A moon!Frustration tangled him.He felt the pressure of mass unconscious, that burgeoning sweep of humankind across his universe.They rushed upon him with a force like a gigantic tidal bore.He sensed the vast migrations at work in human affairs: eddies, currents, gene flows.No dams of abstinence, no seizures of impotence nor maledictions could stop it.Muad'dib's Jihad was less than an eye blink in this larger movement.The Bene Gesserit swimming in this tide, that corporate entity trading in genes, was trapped in the torrent as he was.Visions of a falling moon must be measured against other legends, other visions in a universe where even the seemingly eternal stars waned, flickered, died...What mattered a single moon in such a universe?Far within his fortress citadel, so deep within that the sound sometimes lost itself in the flow of city noises, a ten string rebaba tinkled with a song of the Jihad, a lament for a woman left behind on Arrakis:  		Her hips are dunes curved by the wind, 		Her eyes shine like summer heat.Two braids of hair hang down her back   		Rich with water rings, her hair!My hands remember her skin, 		Fragrant as amber, flower scented.Eyelids tremble with memories...I am stricken by love's white flame!The song sickened him.A tune for stupid creatures lost in sentimentality!As well sing to the dune impregnated corpse Alia had seen.A figure moved in shadows of the balcony's grillwork.Paul whirled.The ghola emerged into the sun's full glare.His metal eyes glittered."Is it Duncan Idaho or the man called Hayt?"Paul asked.The ghola came to a stop two paces from him."Which would my Lord prefer?"The voice carried a soft ring of caution."Play the Zensunni," Paul said bitterly.Meanings within meanings!What could a Zensunni philosopher say or do to change one jot of the reality unrolling before them at this instant?"My Lord is troubled. "Paul turned away, stared at the Shield Wall's distant scarp, saw wind carved arches and buttresses, terrible mimicry of his city.Nature playing a joke on him!See what I can build!He recognized a slash in the distant massif, a place where sand spilled from a crevasse, and thought: There!Right there, we fought Sardaukar!"What troubles my lord?"the ghola asked."A vision," Paul whispered."Ahhhhh, when the Tleilaxu first awakened me, I had visions.I was restless, lonely...not really knowing I was lonely.Not then.My visions revealed nothing!The Tleilaxu told me it was an intrusion of the flesh which men and gholas all suffer, a sickness, no more. "Paul turned, studied the ghola's eyes, those pitted, steely balls without expression.What visions did those eyes see?"Duncan...Duncan... "Paul whispered."I am called Hayt. ""I saw a moon fall," Paul said."It was gone, destroyed.I heard a great hissing.The earth shook. ""You are drunk on too much time," the ghola said."I ask for the Zensunni and get the mentat!"Paul said."Very well!Play my vision through your logic, mentat.Analyze it and reduce it to mere words laid out for burial. ""Burial, indeed," the ghola said."You run from death.You strain at the next instant, refuse to live here and now.Augury!What a crutch for an Emperor!"Paul found himself fascinated by a well remembered mole on the ghola's chin."Trying to live in this future," the ghola said, "do you give substance to such a future?Do you make it real?""If I go the way of my vision future, I'll be alive then," Paul muttered."What makes you think I want to live there?"The ghola shrugged."You asked me for a substantial answer. ""Where is there substance in a universe composed of events?"Paul asked."Is there a final answer?Doesn't each solution produce new questions?""You've digested so much time you have delusions of immortality," the ghola said."Even your Empire, my lord, must live its time and die. ""Don't parade smoke blackened altars before me," Paul growled."I've heard enough sad histories of gods and messiahs.Why should I need special powers to forecast ruins of my own like all those others?The lowliest servant of my kitchens could do this. "He shook his head."The moon fell!""You've not brought your mind to rest at its beginning," the ghola said."Is that how you destroy me?"Paul demanded."Prevent me from collecting my thoughts?""Can you collect chaos?"the ghola asked."We Zensunni say: 'Not collecting, that is the ultimate gathering. 'What can you gather without gathering yourself?""I'm deviled by a vision and you spew nonsense!"Paul raged."What do you know of prescience?""I've seen the oracle at work," the ghola said."I've seen those who seek signs and omens for their individual destiny.They fear what they seek. ""My falling moon is real," Paul whispered.He took a trembling breath."It moves.It moves. ""Men always fear things which move by themselves," the ghola said."You fear your own powers.Things fall into your head from nowhere.When they fall out, where do they go?""You comfort me with thorns," Paul growled.An inner illumination came over the ghola's face.For a moment, he became pure Duncan Idaho."I give you what comfort I can," he said.Paul wondered at that momentary spasm.Had the ghola felt grief which his mind rejected?Had Hayt put down a vision of his own?"My moon has a name," Paul whispered.He let the vision flow over him then.Though his whole being shrieked, no sound escaped him.He was afraid to speak, fearful that his voice might betray him.The air of this terrifying future was thick with Chani's absence.Flesh that had cried in ecstasy, eyes that had burned him with their desire, the voice that had charmed him because it played no tricks of subtle control   all gone, back into the water and the sand.Slowly, Paul turned away, looked out at the present and the plaza before Alia's temple.Three shaven headed pilgrims entered from the processional avenue.They wore grimy yellow robes and hurried with their heads bent against the afternoon's wind.One walked with a limp, dragging his left foot.They beat their way against the wind, rounded a corner and were gone from his sight.Just as his moon would go, they were gone.Still, his vision lay before him.Its terrible purpose gave him no choice.The flesh surrenders itself, he thought.Eternity takes back its own.Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time.What can we say of this?I occurred.I am not...yet, I occurred.= = = = = =   "You do not beg the sun for mercy. "Maud'dib's Travail from The Stilgar Commentary   One moment of incompetence can be fatal, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam reminded herself.She hobbled along, apparently unconcerned, within a ring of Fremen guards.One of those behind her, she knew, was a deaf mute immune to any wiles of Voice.No doubt he'd been charged to kill her at the slightest provocation.Why had Paul summoned her?she wondered.Was he about to pass sentence?She remembered the day long ago when she'd tested him...the child kwisatz haderach.He was a deep one.Damn his mother for all eternity!It was her fault the Bene Gesserit had lost their hold on this gene line.Silence surged along the vaulted passages ahead of her entourage.She sensed the word being passed.Paul would hear the silence.He'd know of her coming before it was announced.She didn't delude herself with ideas that her powers exceeded his.Damn him!She begrudged the burdens age had imposed on her: the aching joints, responses not as quick as once they'd been, muscles not as elastic as the whipcords of her youth.A long day lay behind her and a long life.She'd spent this day with the Dune Tarot in a fruitless search for some clue to her own fate.But the cards were sluggish.The guards herded her around a corner into another of the seemingly endless vaulted passages.Triangular meta glass windows on her left gave a view upward to trellised vines and indigo flowers in deep shadows cast by the afternoon sun.Tiles lay underfoot   figures of water creatures from exotic planets.Water reminders everywhere.Wealth...riches.Robed figures passed across another hall in front of her, cast covert glances at the Reverend Mother.Recognition was obvious in their manner   and tension.She kept her attention on the sharp hairline of the guard immediately in front: young flesh, pink creases at the uniform collar.The immensity of this ighir citadel began to impress her.Passages...passages...They passed an open doorway from which emerged the sound of timbur and flute playing soft, elder music.A glance showed her blue in blue Fremen eyes staring from the room.She sensed in them the ferment of legendary revolts stirring in wild genes.There lay the measure of her personal burden, she knew.A Bene Gesserit could not escape awareness of the genes and their possibilities.She was touched by a feeling of loss: that stubborn fool of an Atreides!How could he deny the jewels of posterity within his loins?A kwisatz haderach!Born out of this time, true, but real   as real as his abomination of a sister...and there lay a dangerous unknown.A wild Reverend Mother spawned without Bene Gesserit inhibitions, holding no loyalty to orderly development of the genes.She shared her brother's powers, no doubt   and more.The size of the citadel began to oppress her.Would the passages never end?The place reeked of terrifying physical power.No planet, no civilization in all human history had ever before seen such man made immensity.A dozen ancient cities could be hidden in its walls!They passed oval doors with winking lights.She recognized them for Ixian handiwork: pneumatic transport orifices.Why was she being marched all this distance, then?The answer began to shape itself in her mind: to oppress her in preparation for this audience with the Emperor.A small clue, but it joined other subtle indications   the relative suppression and selection of words by her escort, the traces of primitive shyness in their eyes when they called her Reverend Mother, the cold and bland, essentially odorless nature of these halls   all combined to reveal much that a Bene Gesserit could interpret.Paul wanted something from her!She concealed a feeling of elation.A bargaining lever existed.It remained only to find the nature of that lever and test its strength.Some levers had moved things greater than this citadel.A finger's touch had been known to topple civilizations.The Reverend Mother reminded herself then of Scytale's assessment: When a creature has developed into one thing, he will choose death rather than change into his opposite.The passages through which she was being escorted grew larger by subtle stages   tricks of arching, graduated amplification of pillared supports, displacement of the triangular windows by larger, oblong shapes.Ahead of her, finally, loomed double doors centered in the far wall of a tall antechamber.She sensed that the doors were very large, and was forced to suppress a gasp as her trained awareness measured out the true proportions.The doorway stood at least eighty meters high, half that in width.As she approached with her escort, the doors swung inward   an immense and silent movement of hidden machinery.She recognized more Ixian handiwork.Through that towering doorway she marched with her guards into the Grand Reception Hall of the Emperor Paul Atreides   "Muad'dib, before whom all people are dwarfed. "Now, she saw the effect of that popular saying at work.As she advanced toward Paul on the distant throne, the Reverend Mother found herself more impressed by the architectural subtleties of her surroundings than she was by the immensities.The space was large: it could've housed the entire citadel of any ruler in human history.The open sweep of the room said much about hidden structural forces balanced with nicety.Trusses and supporting beams behind these walls and the faraway domed ceiling must surpass anything ever before attempted.Everything spoke of engineering genius.Without seeming to do so, the hall grew smaller at its far end, refusing to dwarf Paul on his throne centered on a dais.An untrained awareness, shocked by surrounding proportions, would see him at first as many times larger than his actual size.Colors played upon the unprotected psyche: Paul's green throne had been cut from a single Hagar emerald.It suggested growing things and, out of the Fremen mythos, reflected the mourning color.It whispered that here sat he who could make you mourn   life and death in one symbol, a clever stress of opposites.Behind the throne, draperies cascaded in burnt orange, curried gold of Dune earth, and cinnamon flecks of melange.To a trained eye, the symbolism was obvious, but it contained hammer blows to beat down the uninitiated.Time played its role here.The Reverend Mother measured the minutes required to approach the Imperial Presence at her hobbling pace.You had time to be cowed.Any tendency toward resentment would be squeezed out of you by the unbridled power which focused down upon your person.You might start the long march toward that throne as a human of dignity, but you ended the march as a gnat.Aides and attendants stood around the Emperor in a curiously ordered sequence   attentive household guardsmen along the draped back wall, that abomination, Alia, two steps below Paul and on his left hand; Stilgar, the Imperial lackey, on the step directly below Alia; and on the right, one step up from the floor of the hall, a solitary figure: the fleshly revenant of Duncan Idaho, the ghola.She marked older Fremen among the guardsmen, bearded Naibs with stillsuit scars on their noses, sheathed crysknives at their waists, a few maula pistols, even some lasguns.Those most be trusted men, she thought, to carry lasguns in Paul's presence when he obviously wore a shield generator.She could see the shimmering of its field around him.One burst of a lasgun into that field and the entire citadel would be a hole in the ground.Her guard stopped ten paces from the foot of the dais, parted to open an unobstructed view of the Emperor.She noted now the absence of Chani and Irulan, wondered at it.He held no important audience without them, so it was said.Paul nodded to her, silent, measuring.Immediately, she decided to take the offensive, said: "So, the great Paul Atreides deigns to see the one he banished. "Paul smiled wryly, thinking: She knows I want something from her.That knowledge had been inevitable, she being who she was.He recognized her powers.The Bene Gesserit didn't become Reverend Mothers by chance."Shall we dispense with fencing?"he asked.Would it be this easy?she wondered.And she said: "Name the thing you want. "Stilgar stirred, cast a sharp glance at Paul.The Imperial lackey didn't like her tone."Stilgar wants me to send you away," Paul said."Not kill me?"she asked."I would've expected something more direct from a Fremen Naib. "Stilgar scowled, said: "Often, I must speak otherwise than I think.That is called diplomacy. ""Then let us dispense with diplomacy as well," she said."Was it necessary to have me walk all that distance.I am an old woman. ""You had to be shown how callous I can be," Paul said."That way, you'll appreciate magnanimity. ""You dare such gaucheries with a Bene Gesserit?"she asked."Gross actions carry their own messages," Paul said.She hesitated, weighed his words.So   he might yet dispense with her...grossly, obviously, if she...if she what?"Say what it is you want from me," she muttered.Alia glanced at her brother, nodded toward the draperies behind the throne.She knew Paul's reasoning in this, but disliked it all the same.Call it wild prophecy: She felt pregnant with reluctance to take part in this bargaining."You must be careful how you speak to me, old woman," Paul said.He called me old woman when he was a stripling, the Reverend Mother thought.Does he remind me now of my hand in his past?The decision I made then, must I remake it here?She felt the weight of decision, a physical thing that set her knees to trembling.Muscles cried their fatigue."It was a long walk," Paul said, "and I can see that you're tired.We will retire to my private chamber behind the throne.You may sit there. "He gave a hand signal to Stilgar, arose.Stilgar and the ghola converged on her, helped her up the steps, followed Paul through a passage concealed by the draperies.She realized then why he had greeted her in the hall: a dumb show for the guards and Naibs.He feared them, then.And now   now, he displayed kindly benevolence, daring such wiles on a Bene Gesserit.Or was it daring?She sensed another presence behind, glanced back to see Alia following.The younger woman's eyes held a brooding, baleful cast.The Reverend Mother shuddered.The private chamber at the end of the passage was a twenty meter cube of plasmeld, yellow glowglobes for light, the deep orange hangings of a desert stilltent around the walls.It contained divans, soft cushions, a faint odor of melange, crystal water flagons on a low table.It felt cramped, tiny after the outer hall.Paul seated her on a divan, stood over her, studying the ancient face   steely teeth, eyes that hid more than they revealed, deeply wrinkled skin.He indicated a water flagon.She shook her head, dislodging a wisp of gray hair.In a low voice, Paul said: "I wish to bargain with you for the life of my beloved. "Stilgar cleared his throat.Alia fingered the handle of the crysknife sheathed at her neck.The ghola remained at the door, face impassive, metal eyes pointed at the air above the Reverend Mother's head."Have you had a vision of my hand in her death?"the Reverend Mother asked.She kept her attention on the ghola, oddly disturbed by him.Why should she feel threatened by the ghola?He was a tool of the conspiracy."I know what it is you want from me," Paul said, avoiding her question.Then he only suspects, she thought.The Reverend Mother looked down at the tips of her shoes exposed by a fold of her robe.Black...black...shoes and robe showed marks of her confinement: stains, wrinkles.She lifted her chin, met an angry glare in Paul's eyes.Elation surged through her, but she hid the emotion behind pursed lips, slitted eyelids."What coin do you offer?"she asked."You may have my seed, but not my person," Paul said."Irulan banished and inseminated by artificial  "  "You dare!"the Reverend Mother flared, stiffening.Stilgar took a half step forward.Disconcertingly, the ghola smiled.And now Alia was studying him."We'll not discuss the things your Sisterhood forbids," Paul said."I will listen to no talk of sins, abominations or the beliefs left over from past Jihads.You may have my seed for your plans, but no child of Irulan's will sit on my throne. ""Your throne," she sneered."My throne. ""Then who will bear the Imperial heir?""Chani. ""She is barren. ""She is with child. "An involuntary indrawn breath exposed her shock."You lie!"she snapped.Paul held up a restraining hand as Stilgar surged forward."We've known for two days that she carries my child. ""But Irulan...  ""By artificial means only.That's my offer. "The Reverend Mother closed her eyes to hide his face.Damnation!To cast the genetic dice in such a way!Loathing boiled in her breast.The teaching of the Bene Gesserit, the lessons of the Butlerian Jihad   all proscribed such an act.One did not demean the highest aspirations of humankind.No machine could function in the way of a human mind.No word or deed could imply that men might be bred on the level of animals."Your decision," Paul said.She shook her head.The genes, the precious Atreides genes   only these were important.Need went deeper than proscription.For the Sisterhood, mating mingled more than sperm and ovum.One aimed to capture the psyche.The Reverend Mother understood now the subtle depths of Paul's offer.He would make the Bene Gesserit party to an act which would bring down popular wrath...were it ever discovered.They could not admit such paternity if the Emperor denied it.This coin might save the Atreides genes for the Sisterhood, but it would never buy a throne.She swept her gaze around the room, studying each face: Stilgar, passive and waiting now; the ghola frozen at some inward place; Alia watching the ghola...and Paul   wrath beneath a shallow veneer."This is your only offer?"she asked."My only offer. "She glanced at the ghola, caught by a brief movement of muscles across his cheeks.Emotion?"You, ghola," she said."Should such an offer be made?Having been made, should it be accepted?Function as the mentat for us. "The metallic eyes turned to Paul."Answer as you will," Paul said.The ghola returned his gleaming attention to the Reverend Mother, shocked her once more by smiling."An offer is only as good as the real thing it buys," he said."The exchange offered here is life for life, a high order of business. "Alia brushed a strand of coppery hair from her forehead, said: "And what else is hidden in this bargain?"The Reverend Mother refused to look at Alia, but the words burned in her mind.Yes, far deeper implications lay here.The sister was an abomination, true, but there could be no denying her status as a Reverend Mother with all the title implied.Gaius Helen Mohiam felt herself in this instant to be not one single person, but all the others who sat like tiny congeries in her memory.They were alert, every Reverend Mother she had absorbed in becoming a Priestess of the Sisterhood.Alia would be standing in the same situation here."What else?"the ghola asked."One wonders why the witches of the Bene Gesserit have not used Tleilaxu methods. "Gaius Helen Mohiam and all the Reverend Mothers within her shuddered.Yes, the Tleilaxu did loathsome things.If one let down the barriers to artificial insemination, was the next step a Tleilaxu one   controlled mutation?Paul, observing the play of emotion around him, felt abruptly that he no longer knew these people.He could see only strangers.Even Alia was a stranger.Alia said: "If we set the Atreides genes adrift in a Bene Gesserit river, who knows what may result?"Gaius Helen Mohiam's head snapped around, and she met Alia's gaze.For a flashing instant, they were two Reverend Mothers together, communing on a single thought: What lay behind any Tleilaxu action?The ghola was a Tleilaxu thing.Had he put this plan into Paul's mind?Would Paul attempt to bargain directly with the Bene Tleilaxu?She broke her gaze from Alia's, feeling her own ambivalence and inadequacies.The pitfall of Bene Gesserit training, she reminded herself, lay in the powers granted: such powers predisposed one to vanity and pride.But power deluded those who used it.One tended to believe power could overcome any barrier...including one's own ignorance.Only one thing stood paramount here for the Bene Gesserit, she told herself.That was the pyramid of generations which had reached an apex in Paul Atreides...and in his abomination of a sister.A wrong choice here and the pyramid would have to be rebuilt...starting generations back in the parallel lines and with breeding specimens lacking the choicest characteristics.Controlled mutation, she thought.Did the Tleilaxu really practice it?How tempting!She shook her head, the better to rid it of such thoughts."You reject my proposal?"Paul asked."I'm thinking," she said.And again, she looked at the sister.The optimum cross for this female Atreides had been lost...killed by Paul.
