Ah yes.He closed his eyes, appeared to sleep for a second or two.Im sorry about Arkady.Yes.Another silence.She looks like a girl.A little.Actually Nadia had never seen Maya look older.They were all pushing eighty, they couldnt keep the pace, treatments or not.In their minds they were old.The folks on Vega told me that Phyllis and the rest of the people on Clarke are going to try to get across to them in an emergency rocket.Arent they out of the plane of the ecliptic?They are now, but theyre going to try to push down to Jupiter, and use it to swing back down system.Thatll take a year or two, wont it?About a year.Hopefully theyll miss entirely, or fall into Jupiter.Or run out of food.I take it youre not happy with Phyllis.That bitch.Shes responsible for a lot of this.Pulling in all those transnats with promises of every metal ever put to use she figured she would be queen of Mars with all those folks backing her.You should have seen her up there on Clarke, looking down at the planet like a little tin god.I could have strangled her.How I wish I could have seen her face when Clarke took off and went flying!He laughed harshly.Maya stirred at the sound, woke.They pulled her up and went out into the park in search of a meal.They got in a line of people huddled in their walkers, coughing, rubbing their hands together, blowing out plumes of frost like white cotton balls.Very few talked.Frank surveyed the scene with a disgusted look, and when they got their trays of rshti and tabouli he devoured his and began conversing to his wristpad in Arabic.They say Alex and Evgenia and Samantha are coming up Noctis with some Bedouin friends of mine, he told them when he shut down.That was good news.Alex and Evgenia had been heard from last in Aureum Overlook, a rebel bastion that had destroyed a number of orbiting U. N.  ships before being incinerated by missile fire from Phobos.And no one had heard from Samantha the whole month of the war.So all the first hundred in town went to the north gate of Cairo that afternoon to greet them.Cairos north gate looked down a long natural ramp that ran into one of the southernmost canyons of Noctis.The road rose up from the canyon floor on this ramp, and they could see all the way down it to the canyon bottom.There, in the early afternoon, came a rover caravan, churning up a small dust cloud and moving slowly.It was nearly an hour before the cars rolled up the last part of the ramp.They were no more than three kilometers away when great gouts of flame and ejecta burst into being among them, knocking some rovers into the cliff wall, some over the ramp into space.The rest twisted to a halt, shattered and burning.Then an explosion rocked the north gate, and they dove for the wall.Cries and shouts over the common band.Nothing more; they stood back up.The fabric of the tent still held, although the gate lock was apparently stuck fast.Down on the road thin plumes of tan smoke lofted into the air, tattering to the east, pulled back down into Noctis on the dusk wind.Nadia sent a robot rover down to check for survivors.Wristpads crackled with static, nothing but static, and Nadia was thankful for that; what could they have hoped for?Screams?Frank was cursing into his wristpad, switching between Arabic and English.Trying vainly to find out what had happened.But Alexander, Evgenia, Samantha...Nadia looked fearfully at the little images on her wrist, directing the robot cameras with dread.Shattered rovers.Some bodies.Nothing moved.One rover still smoked.Wheres Sasha?Yelis voice cried.Wheres Sasha?She was in the lock, someone said.She was going out to greet them.They went to work opening the inner lock door, Nadia at the front punching all the codes and then working with tools and finally a shape charge that someone handed to her.They moved back and the lock blew out like a crossbow bolt, and then they were there, crowbarring the heavy door back.Nadia rushed in and dropped to her knees by Sasha, who was huddled head in jacket, in the emergency posture; but she was dead, the flesh of her face Martian red, her eyes frozen.Feeling that she had to move or else turn to stone on the spot, Nadia broke and ran back to the town cars they had come in.She jumped in one and drove away; she had no plan, and the car seemed to choose the direction.Her friends voices cut through the crackle on her wristpad, sounding like crickets in a cage, Maya muttering viciously in Russian, crying only Maya was tough enough to keep feeling in all of thisThat was Phobos again!her little voice cried.Theyre psychotic up there!The others were in shock, their voices like AIs.Theyre not psychotic, Frank said.Its perfectly rational.They see a political settlement coming and theyre getting in as many shots as they can.Murderous bastards!Maya cried.KGB fascists....The town car stopped at the city offices.Nadia ran inside, to the room where she had stashed her stuff, at this point no more than her old blue backpack.She dug in it, still unaware of what she was looking for until her claw hand, still the strong one, reached into a bag and pulled it out.Arkadys transmitter.Of course.She ran back to the car and drove to the south gate.Sax and Frank were still talking, Sax sounding the same as always, but saying, Every one of us whose location is known is either here, or else has been killed.I think theyre after the first hundred in particular.Singling us out, you mean?Frank said.I saw some Terran news that said we were the ringleaders.And twenty one of us have died since the revolt began.Another forty missing.The town car arrived at the south gate.Nadia turned off her intercom, got out of the car, went into the lock and put on boots, helmet, gloves.She pumped up and checked out, then slammed the open button and waited for the lock to empty and open.As it had on Sasha.They had lived a lifetime together in just the last month alone.Then she was out onto the surface, into the glare and push of a windy hazy day, feeling the first diamond bite of the cold.She kicked through drifts of fines and red puffs blew out ahead of her.The hollow woman, kicking blood.Out the other gate were the bodies of her friends and others, their dead faces purplish and bloated, as after construction accidents.Nadia had seen several of those now, seen death several times, and each had been a horror and yet here they were deliberately creating as many of these horrible accidents as they could!That was war; killing people by every means possible.People who might have lived a thousand years.She thought of Arkady and of a thousand years, and hissed.They had quarreled so in recent years, mostly about politics.Your plans are all anachronism, Nadia had said.You dont understand the world.Ha!he had laughed, offended.This world I understand.With an expression as dark as any she had ever seen from him.And she remembered when he had given her the transmitter, how he had cried for John, how crazy he had been with rage and grief.Just in case, he had said to her refusals, pleading.Just in case.And now it had happened.She couldnt believe it.She took the box from her walkers thigh pocket, turned it over in her hand.Phobos shot up over the western horizon like a gray potato.The sun had just set, and the alpenglow was so strong that it looked like she was standing in her own blood, as if she were a creature as small as a cell standing on the corroded wall of her heart, while around her swept the winds of her own dusty plasma.Rockets were landing at the spaceport north of the city.The dusk mirrors gleamed in the western sky like a cluster of evening stars.A busy sky.U. N.  ships would soon be descending.Phobos crossed the sky in four and a quarter hours, so she didnt have to wait long.It had risen as a half moon, but now it was gibbous, almost full, halfway to the zenith, moving at its steady clip across the coagulating sky.She could make out a faint point of light inside the gray disk: the two little domed craters, Semenov and Leveykin.She held the radio transmitter out and tapped in the ignition code, MANGALA.It was like using a TV remote.A bright light flared on the leading edge of the little gray disk.The two faint lights went out.The bright light flared even brighter.Could she really perceive the deceleration?Probably not; but it was there.Phobos was on its way down.Back inside Cairo, she found that the news had already spread.The flare had been bright enough to catch peoples eyes, and after that they had clumped together around the blank TV screens, by habit, and exchanged rumors and speculation, and somehow the basic fact had gotten around, or been worked out independently.Nadia strolled past group after group, and heard people saying Phobos has been hit!Phobos has been hit!And someone laughed, They brought the Roche limit up to it!She thought she was lost in the medina, but almost directly she came to the city offices.Maya was outside: Hey Nadia!she cried, Did you see Phobos?Yes.Roger says when they were up there in year One, they built a system of explosives and rocketry into it!Did Arkady ever tell you about it?Yes.They went in to the offices, Maya thinking aloud: If they manage to slow it down very much, itll come down.I wonder if itll be possible to calculate where.Were pretty damn close to the equator right here.Itll break up, surely, and come down in a lot of places.True.I wonder what Sax thinks.They found Sax and Frank bunched before one screen, Yeli and Ann and Simon before another.A UNOMA satellite was tracking Phobos with a telescope, and Sax was measuring the moons speed of passage across the Martian landscape to get a fix on its velocity.In the image on the screen Stickneys dome shone like a Faberg egg, but the eye was drawn away from that to the moons leading edge, which was blurry and streaked with white flashes of ejecta and gases.Look how well balanced the thrust is, Sax said to no one in particular.Too sudden a thrust and the whole thing would have shattered.And an unbalanced thrust would have set it spinning, and then the thrust would have pushed it all over the place.I see signs of stabilizing lateral thrusts, his AI said.Attitude jets, Sax said.They turned Phobos into a big rocket.They did it in the first year, Nadia said.She wasnt sure why she was speaking, she still seemed out of control, observing her actions from several seconds behind.A lot of the Phobos crew was from rocketry and guidance.They processed the ice veins into liquid oxygen and deuterium, and stored it in lined columns buried in the chondrite.The engines and the control complex were buried centrally.So it is a big rocket.Sax was nodding as he typed.Period of Phobos, 27,547 seconds.So its going...2.146 kilometers per second, approximately, and to bring it down it needs to decelerate to...to 1.561 kilometers per second.So, .585 kilometers per second slower.For a mass like Phobos...wow.Thats a lot of fuel.Whats it down to now?Frank asked.He was black faced, his jaw muscles pulsing under the skin like little biceps furious, Nadia saw, at his inability to predict what would happen next.About one point seven.And those big thrusters still burning.Itll come down.But not in one piece.The descent will break it up, Im sure.The Roche limit?No, just stress from aerobraking, and with all these empty fuel chambers....What happened to the people on it?Nadia heard herself ask.Someone came on and said it sounded like the whole population had bailed out.No one stuck around to try and stop the firing.Good, Nadia said, sitting down heavily on the couch.So when will it come down?Frank demanded.Sax blinked.Impossible to say.Depends on when it breaks up, and how.But pretty soon, Id guess.Within a day.And then therell be a stretch somewhere along the equator, probably a big stretch of it, in big trouble.Its going to make a fairly large meteor shower.That will clear away some of the elevator cable, Simon said weakly.He was sitting beside Ann, watching her with concern.She stared at Simons screen bleakly, showed no sign of hearing any of them.There never had been word of their son Peter.Was that better or worse than a soot pile, a dotcode name coming up on your wristpad?Better, Nadia decided.But still hard.Look, Sax said, its breaking up.The satellite telescopic camera gave them an excellent view.The dome over Stickney burst outward in great shards and the crater pit lines that had always marked Phobos suddenly puffed with dust, yawning open.Then the little potato shaped world blossomed, fell apart into a scattering of irregular chunks.A half a dozen large ones slowly spread out, the largest one leading the way.One chunk flew off to the side, apparently powered still by one of the rockets that had lain buried in the moons interior.The rest of the rocks began to spread out in an irregular line, tumbling each at a different speed.Well, were kind of in the line of fire, Sax remarked, looking up at the rest of them.The biggest chunks will hit the upper atmosphere soon, and then itll happen pretty quickly.Can you determine where?No, theres too many unknowns.Along the equator, thats all.Were probably far enough south to miss most of it, but there may be quite a scatter effect.People on the equator ought to head north or south, Maya said.They probably know that.Anyway the fall of the cable probably cleared the area pretty effectively already.There was little to do but wait.None of them wanted to leave the city and head south, it seemed they were past that kind of effort, too hardened or too tired to worry about longshot risks.Frank paced the room, his swarthy face working with anger; finally he couldnt stand it, and got back on his screen to send off a sequence of short pungent messages.One came back in, and he snorted.Weve got a grace period, because the U. N.  police are afraid to come down here until after the shit falls.After that theyll be on us like hawks.Theyre claiming that the command initiating the Phobos explosions originated here, and theyre tired of a neutral city being used as a command center for the insurrection.So weve got until the fall is over, Sax said.He clicked into the UNOMA network, and got a radar composite of the fragments.After that there was nothing to do.They sat; they stood and walked around; they looked at the screens; they ate cold pizza; they napped.Nadia did none of these things.She could only manage to sit, hunched over her stomach, which felt like an iron walnut in her.She waited.Near midnight and the timeslip, something on the screens caught Saxs attention, and with some furious typing on Franks channels he got through to the Olympus Mons observatory.It was just before dawn there, still dark, and one of the observatory cameras gave them its low space view southward, the black curve of the planet blocking the stars.Shooting stars were blazing down at an angle out of the western sky, as fast and bright as if they were perfectly straight lightning bolts, or titanic tracer bullets, spraying in a sequence eastward, breaking apart in the last moments before impact, causing phosphor blobs to burst into existence at every impact point, like the first moments of a whole string of nuclear explosions.In less than ten seconds the strike was over, leaving the black field dotted with a line of glowing yellow smoke obscured patches.Nadia closed her eyes, saw swimming afterimages of the strike.She opened them again, looked at the screen.Clouds of smoke were surging up into the predawn sky over west Tharsis, pouring so high that they got up out of the shadow of the planet and were lit by the rising sun; they were mushroom clouds, their heads a bright pale pink, their dark gray stalks illuminated by reflection from above.Slowly the sunlight moved down the tumultuous stalks, until they were all burnished by the new morning sun.Then the lofty line of yellow and pink mushroom clouds drifted across a sky that was a delicate shade of indigo pastel: it looked like a Maxfield Parrish nightmare, too strange and beautiful a sight to believe.Nadia thought of the cables last moment, that image of the incandescent double helix of diamonds.How was it that destruction could be so beautiful?Was there something in the scale of it?Was there some shadow in people, lusting for it?Or was it just a coincidental combination of the elements, the final proof that beauty has no moral dimension?She stared and stared at the image, focused all her will on it; but she could not make it make sense.That may be enough particulate matter to trigger another global dust storm, Sax observed.Although the net heat addition to the system will surely be considerable.Shut up, Sax, Maya said.Frank said, Its about our turn to get hit, right?Sax nodded.They left the city offices and went out into the park.Everyone stood facing northwest.It was silent, as if they were performing some religious ritual.It felt completely different from waiting for bombardment by the police.By now it was mid morning, the sky a dull dusty pink.Then over the horizon lanced a painfully bright comet; there was a collective indrawn gasp, punctuated by scattered cries.The brilliant white line curved down toward them, then shot over their heads in an instant, disappearing over the eastern horizon.There hadnt even been time to catch ones breath as it passed.A moment later the ground trembled slightly under their feet, and the silence was broken by exclamations.To the east a cloud shot up, redefining the height of the skys pink dome; it must have plumed 20,000 meters.Then another brilliant white blaze crossed the sky overhead, trailing comet tails of fire.Then another, and another, and a whole blazing cluster of them, all crossing the sky and dropping over the eastern horizon, down into great Marineris.Finally the shower stopped, leaving the witnesses in Cairo half blinded, staggering, afterimages bouncing in their sight.They had been passed over.Now comes the U. N. , Frank said.At best.Do you think we ought to ...Maya said.Do you think were ...Safe in their hands?Frank said acidly.Maybe we should take to the planes again.In daylight?Well, it might be better than staying here!she retorted.I dont know about you, but I dont want to just get lined up against a wall and shot!If theyre UNOMA they wont do that, Sax said.You cant be sure, Maya said.Everyone on Earth thinks were the ringleaders.There arent any ringleaders!Frank said.But they want there to be ringleaders, Nadia said.This stilled them.Sax said mildly, Someone may have decided things will be easier to control without us around.More news of impacts in the other hemisphere came in, and Sax settled down before the screens to follow it.Helplessly Ann stood over his right shoulder to observe it as well; these kinds of strikes had happened all the time back in the Noachian, and the chance to see one live was too much for her to pass up, even if it was the result of human agency.While they watched, Maya continued to urge them to do something to leave, to hide, whatever, just something.She swore at Sax and Ann both when they didnt respond.Frank left to see what was happening at the spaceport.Nadia accompanied him to the door of the city offices, afraid that Maya was right, but unwilling to listen anymore.She said good bye to Frank and stood before the city building, looking at the sky.It was afternoon, and the prevailing westerlies were beginning to sweep down the slope of Tharsis, bringing with them dust from the impacts.It looked like smoke in the sky, as if there were a forest fire on the other side of Tharsis.The light inside Cairo dimmed as the dust clouds obscured the sun, and the tents polarization created short rainbows and sundogs, as if the very fabric of the world were unraveling into kaleidoscopic parts.Huddled masses, under a burning sky.Nadia shivered.A thicker cloud covered the sun like an eclipse.She went indoors, out of its shadow, back into the offices.Sax was saying, Very likely to begin another global.I hope it does, Maya said.She was pacing back and forth like a great cat in a cage.It will help us escape.Escape where?Sax asked.Maya sucked air in through her teeth.The planes are stocked.We could go back to the Hellespontus Montes, to the habitats there.Theyd see us.Frank came onto Saxs screen.He was staring into his wristpad, and the image quivered.Im at the west gate with the mayor.Theres a bunch of rovers outside.Weve locked all the gates because they wont identify themselves.Apparently theyve surrounded the city, and are trying to broach the physical plant from the outside.So everyone should get their walkers on, and be ready to go.I told you we should have left!Maya cried.We couldnt have, Sax said.Anyway, our chances may be just as good in some sort of melee.If everyone makes a break for it at once, they might be overwhelmed by numbers.Now look, if anything happens, lets all meet at the east gate, okay?You go ahead and go.Frank, he said to the screen, you should get over there too when you can.Im going to try some things with the physical plant robots that should keep those people out until dark at least.It was now three p. m. , although it seemed like twilight, as the sky was thick with high, rapidly moving dust clouds.The forces outside identified themselves as UNOMA police, and demanded to be let in.Frank and Cairos mayor asked them for authorization from U. N.  Geneva, and declared a ban on all arms in the city.The forces outside made no reply.At 4:30 alarms went off all over the city.The tent had been broached, apparently catastrophically, because a sudden wind whipped west through the streets, and pressure sirens went off in every building.The electricity went off, and just that quick it went from a town to a broken shell, full of running figures in walkers and helmets, all of them rushing about, crowding toward the gates, knocked down by gusts of wind or by each other.Windows popped out everywhere, the air was full of clear plastic shrapnel.Nadia, Maya, Ann, Simon and Yeli left the city building, and fought their way through crowds toward the east gate.There was a great crush of people around it because the lock was open, and some people were squeezing through; a deadly situation for anyone who fell underfoot, and if the lock were blocked in any way, it could turn deadly for everyone.And yet it all happened in silence, except for helmet intercoms and some background impacts.The first hundred were tuned to their old band, and over the static and exterior noises Franks voice came on.Im at the east gate now.Get out of the crush so I can find you.His voice was low, businesslike.Hurry up, theres something happening outside the lock.They worked their way out of the crowd, and saw Frank just inside the wall, waving a hand overhead.Come on, the distant figure said in their ears.Dont be such sheep, theres no reason to join the toothpaste when the tents lost its integrity, we can cut through anywhere we want.Lets go straight for the planes.I told you, Maya began, but Frank cut her off: Shut up, Maya, we couldnt leave until something like this happened, remember?It was near sunset now, the sun pouring through a gap between Pavonis and the dust cloud, illuminating the clouds from below in a garish display of violent Martian tones, casting a hellish light over the milling scene.And now figures in camouflaged uniforms were pouring in through rents in the tent.There were big spaceport shuttle buses parked outside, with more troops emerging from them.Sax appeared out of an alley.I dont think well be able to get to the planes, he said.A figure in walker and helmet appeared out of the murk.Come on, it said on their band.Follow me.They stared at this stranger.Who are you?Frank demanded.Follow me!The stranger was a small man, and behind his face plate they could see a bright ferocious grin.Brown thin face.The man took off into an alley leading to the medina, and Maya was the first to follow.Helmeted people ran everywhere; those without helmets were sprawled on the ground, dead or dying.They could hear sirens through their helmets, very faint and attenuated, and there were soundlike vibrations underfoot, seismic booms of some kind; but other than that all the hectic activity occurred in silence, broken only by the sounds of their own breathing, and their voices in each others ears, Where to?Sax are you there?He went down that one, and so forth, a strangely intimate conversation, given the dusky chaos they ran through.Looking around Nadia almost kicked the body of a dead cat, lying in the streetgrass as if asleep.The man they were following appeared to be humming a tune over their band, an absorbed little bum, bum, badum dum dum Peters theme from Peter and the Wolf, perhaps.He knew the streets of Cairo well, making turns in the medinas tight warren without a moments pause for thought, and leading them to the city wall in less than ten minutes.At the wall they peered through the warped tenting; outside in the murk, anonymous suited figures were running off alone or in groups of two or three, in a kind of Brownian dispersion onto the south Noctis rim.Wheres Yeli?Maya exclaimed suddenly.No one knew.Then Frank pointed.Look!Down the road to the east, a number of rovers had appeared out of Noctis Labyrinthus.They were very fast cars of an unfamiliar shape, coming up out of the dusk without headlights.Who now?Sax said.He turned to look at their guide for an answer, but the man was gone, disappeared back into the alleyways.Is this still the first hundreds frequency?a new voice said.Yes!Frank replied.Who is this?Maya cried, Isnt that Michel?Good ear, Maya.Yes, its Michel.Look, were here to take you away if you want to go.It appears they are systematically eliminating any of the first hundred they can get their hands on.So we thought you would be willing to join us.I think we are all ready to join you, Frank said.But how?Well, thats the tricky part.Did a guide show up and lead you to the wall?Yes!Good.That was Coyote, hes good at things like that.So, wait there.We will create some diversions elsewhere, and then come right to your section of the wall.In only a matter of minutes, though it seemed like an hour, explosions rocked the city.They saw flashes of light to the north, toward the spaceport.Michel came back on.Shine a headlamp east for just a second.Sax put his face to the tent wall and turned on his headlamp, briefly illuminating a cone of smoke choked air.Visibility had dropped to a hundred meters or less, and seemed to be still diminishing.But Michels voice said, Contact.Now, cut through the wall and step outside.Were almost there.Well take off again when youre all in our rover locks, so be prepared.How many are you?Six, Frank said after a pause.Wonderful.We have two cars, so it wont be too bad.Three of you in each, okay?Get ready, lets do this fast.Sax and Ann cut at the tent fabric with little knives from their wristpad tool kits; they looked like kittens clawing at drapes, but quickly made holes big enough to crawl through, and they all clambered over the waist high coping, and out onto the smoothed regolith of the wall skirt.Behind them explosions were blowing the physical plant into the sky, illuminating the wrecked city in flashes that cut through the haze like photographic strobes, freezing individual moments before they disappeared in the murk.Suddenly the strange rovers they had seen appeared out of the dust and skidded to a halt before them.They yanked open the outer lock doors and piled in, Sax and Ann and Simon in one, Nadia with Maya and Frank in the other, and they were tumbled head over heels when the rover jerked into motion and accelerated away.Ow!Maya cried.All aboard?Michel asked.They called out their names.Good.Im glad we have you!Michel said.Its getting pretty hard.Dmitri and Elena are dead, I just heard.Killed at Echus Overlook.In the silence that ensued they could hear the tires, grinding over the gravel of the road.These rovers are really fast, Sax remarked.Yes.And great shock absorbers.Made for just this kind of situation, Im afraid.Well have to abandon them once we get down into Noctis; theyre much too visible.You have invisible cars?Frank asked.In a manner of speaking.After half an hour of bouncing in the lock they stopped briefly, and transferred into the rovers main rooms.And there in one was Michel Duval, white haired, wrinkled an old man, gazing at Maya and Nadia and Frank with tears in his eyes.He embraced them one by one, laughing an odd, choked laugh.Youre taking us to Hiroko?Maya said.Yes, we will try.But its a long way, and conditions are not good.But I think we can do it.Oh, I am so glad we have found you!You dont know how horrible it has been to look and look, and find only bodies.We know, Maya said.We found Arkady, and Sasha was just killed today, and Alex and Edvard and Samantha, and I guess Yeli too, just now....Yes.Well.We will try to make sure there arent any more.The rovers TV showed the interior of the following car, where Ann and Simon and Sax were greeted stiffly by a young stranger.Michel turned to look over his shoulder out the windshield, and hissed.They were at the head of one of the many box canyons leading down into Noctis, a rounded canyon end that dropped rapidly away.The road that descended this headwall had followed an artificial ramp that had been built to support it, but now the ramp was gone, blasted away, and the road with it.We will have to walk, Michel said after a while.We would have had to abandon these cars at the bottom anyway.Its only about five kilometers.Are your suits fully supplied?They refilled their tanks from the rover, and put their helmets back on.Then it was back out through the locks.When they were all out, they stood staring at each other: the six refugees, Michel and the younger driver.The eight of them set off on foot, in darkness, using headlamps only during the tricky climb down the broken off section of the road ramp.Once back on the road, they turned their headlamps off and strode down the steeply sloping gravel path, falling naturally into the long lope that was the most comfortable pace in this angle of descent.The night was starless, and the wind whistled down canyon around them, sometimes in gusts so strong that it felt like they were being shoved in the back.It felt like another dust storm was indeed beginning; Sax muttered about equatorial versus global, but it was impossible to tell what it would be.Lets hope it goes global, Michel said.We could use the cover.I doubt it will, Sax said.Whats our destination?Nadia asked.Well, there is an emergency station in Aureum Chaos.So they had to thread the entire length of Valles Marineris5,000 kilometers!How will we do it!Maya cried.We have canyon cars, Michel said briefly.Youll see.The road was a steep one, and they kept up the fast pace, punishing their joints.Nadias right knee began to throb, and her ghost finger itched for the first time in years.She was thirsty, and cold in the old diamond pattern.It got so dusty and dark that they turned on their headlamps.Each bobbing cone of yellow light barely reached to the road surface, and glancing back up Nadia thought they looked like a string of deep sea fish, their luminous spots glowing on a great ocean floor.Or like miners in some fluid smoky tunnel.Some part of her began to enjoy the situation it was a tiny stirring, a sensation mostly physical, but still, the first positive feeling she could remember since finding Arkady.Pleasure like the ghost itching of her lost finger, faint and slightly irritating.It was still the middle of the night when they came to the bottom of the canyon, a broad U, very common to all the Noctis Labyrinthus canyons.Michel approached a boulder, pushed its side with a finger, then lifted a hatch in the boulders side.Get in, he said.There were two of these boulder cars, it turned out; big rovers, shelled by a thin layer of actual basalt.What about their thermal signals?Sax asked as he ducked into one.We direct all the heat into coils, and bury the coils.So theres no signal to speak of.Good idea.The young driver helped them into the new cars.Lets get out of here, he said brusquely, almost shoving them through the outer lock doors.Light from the lock illuminated his face, framed by his helmet: Asian, perhaps twenty five, he aided the refugees without meeting their eye, appearing disgruntled, disgusted, perhaps frightened.He said to them scornfully, Next time you have a revolution youd better try some other way.Part 8    Shikata Ga Nai      When the occupants of the elevator car Bangkok Friend learned that Clarke had broken away and the cable was falling, they hurried to the foyer and the locker room and pulled on emergency spacesuits as fast as they could, and for a wonder there was no general panic, it all happened in the heart, on the surface everyone was businesslike and attentive to the small group at the lock door who were trying to determine where exactly they were, and when they should abandon the car.This steadiness amazed Peter Clayborne, whose own blood was hammering through his body in great adrenal shocks; he wasnt sure he could have spoken if he had to.A man in the group at the front told them in level tones that they were approaching the areosynchronous point and so they all pulled into the lock together until they were jammed in like the suits had been in the storage closet, and then they locked the lock and sucked the air.The outer door slid open and there it was, a big rectangle of starry death black space.It was daunting indeed to launch into it in an untethered spacesuit, it felt to the young man like suicide; but the ones at the front pulled out and the rest followed, like spores from an exploding seed pod.The car and the elevator dwindled eastward and quickly disappeared.The cloud of spacesuits began to disperse.Many of them stabilized with their feet toward Mars, which lay below them like a dirty basketball.When steady, they ignited their main rockets and lofted upward.The group doing the calculations was still on the common band, talking it over as if it were a chess problem.They were near the areosynchronous orbit, but with a downward velocity of several hundred kilometers an hour; burning half their main packs fuel would counteract most of that, and then they would be in an orbit much more stable than would be strictly necessary, given their air supplies.In other words they would die later of asphyxiation rather than sooner of reentry heat.But then that had been the whole point of bailing out in the first place.It was possible rescuers might appear in the grace period, one never knew.Clearly most people were willing to give it a try.The young man pulled his rocket control rods out of his wrist consoles and put his fingers and thumbs on the buttons and got the world between his boots, and shot away from it for a while.Some of the others were trying to stay together, but he judged it impossible and a waste of fuel, and let them drift off above him until they were just more stars.He wasnt as frightened as he had been in the locker, but he was angry and sad: he didnt want to die.A spasm of grief for his lost future shook through him and he cried aloud, and wept.After a while the physical manifestations went away, even though he felt just as miserable as before.He stared dully at the stars.Occasional gusts of fright or despair shuddered through him, but they became less frequent as the minutes dragged on and then the hours.He tried to slow his metabolism but the effort had the opposite effect to that intended, and he decided to forget about it, although first he did call up his pulse rate on his wrist console: 108 beats a minute.Lucky he hadnt checked when they were suiting up and bailing out.He grimaced and tried identifying constellations.Time dragged by.He woke up, and when he realized he had fallen asleep he was both appalled and amused, and promptly fell back asleep.Then after a time he was awake again, this time for good.The other refugees from the car were out of sight, though some stars seemed to move against the backdrop, and could have been them.No sign of the elevator, in space or down on the planets surface.It was an odd way to go.Something like the night before a date with the firing squad, perhaps, spent in a dream of space.Death would be like space, except without the stars or the thinking.It was a tedious wait in some ways; it made him impatient, and he considered turning off his heating system and having done with it.Knowing he could do that made the wait easier, and he figured he would do it when the air supply was about to run out.The thought put his pulse up to 130, and he tried to concentrate on the planet below.Home sweet home.He was still in almost areosynchronous orbit, it had been hours and Tharsis was still below, though a bit farther west.He was over Marineris.Hours passed and without intending to, he fell asleep again.When he woke there was a small silver spacecraft hanging before him like a UFO and he shouted with surprise, and started tumbling helplessly.He worked the rockets feverishly to bring himself under control, and when he managed it the craft was still there.There was a womans face in a side window port, talking to him and pointing to her ear.He turned on the common band but she wasnt on it; he couldnt find her.He rocketed over toward the craft and scared the woman by nearly crashing into it.He managed to arrest and draw back a bit.The woman was gesturing; did he want in?He made a clumsy circle with gloved forefinger and thumb, nodding so vigorously that he started tumbling again.As he spun he saw a bay door open behind the window, on top of the craft.He got the suit stabilized and puffed toward the bay, wondering if it would be real when he got to it.He touched the open doorway and tears sprang to his eyes; he blinked and the teardrop spheres floated into his faceplate as he flattened against the bottom of the bay.He had an hour of air left.When the bay was closed and pumped he unsealed his helmet and lifted it off.The air was thin and oxygen rich, and cool.The bay lock door opened and he pushed through.Women were laughing.There were two of them aboard, and they were in high spirits.What were you going to do, land in that?one asked.I was on the elevator, he said, voice cracking.We had to jump off.Have you picked up anyone else?Youre the only one weve seen.Want a ride down?He could only gulp.They laughed at him.Were amazed to run into anyone out here, boy!How many gs are you comfortable with?I dont know three?They laughed again.Why, how many can you take?A lot more than that, said the woman who had looked out at him.A lot more, he scoffed.How many more can a person take?Well find out, the other woman said, and laughed.The little craft began to accelerate down toward Mars.The youth lay exhausted in a g chair behind the two women, asking questions and sucking down water and cheddar cheese from a tube.They had been on one of the mirror complexes and had hijacked this emergency descender after sending the mirrors tumbling in a tangle of molecule thin sheets.They were complicating their descent by shifting into a polar orbit; they were going to land near the south polar cap.Peter absorbed this in silence.Then they were bouncing wildly and the windows went white, then yellow, then a deep angry orange.Gravity forces jammed him back in his chair, his vision blurred and his neck hurt.What a lightweight, one of the women said, and he didnt know if she meant him or the descender.Then the g forces let off and the window cleared.He looked out and saw that they were dropping toward the planet in a steep dive, and were only a few thousand meters above the surface.He couldnt believe it.The women kept the craft in its radical stoop until it seemed they were going to spear the sand, and then at the last minute they flattened out and again he was shoved back into his chair.Sweet, one of the women commented, and then boom, they were down and running over the layered terrain.Gravity again.Peter clambered out of the descender after the two women, down a walktube and into a big rover, feeling stunned and ready to cry.There were two men in the rover, shouting greetings and hugging the women.Whos this?they cried.Oh, we picked him up up there, he jumped off the elevator.Hes still a bit spaced.Hey, she said to him with a smile, were down, its okay.Some mistakes you can never make good.Ann Clayborne sat in the back of Michels rover, sprawled across three seats, feeling the wheels rise and fall over the rocks.Her mistake had been in coming to Mars in the first place, and then falling in love with it.Falling in love with a place everyone else wanted to destroy.Outside the rover, the planet was being changed forever.Inside, the main room was lit by floor level windows, which gave a snakes eye view out under the skirt of the rovers stone roof.Rough gravel road, scattered rockfall in the way.They were on the Noctis Highway, but a lot of rock had fallen on it.Michel wasnt bothering to drive around the smaller samples; they rolled along at about sixty kph, and when they hit a big one they all jounced in their seats.Sorry, Michel said.We have to get out of the Chandelier as soon as possible.The Chandelier?Noctis Labyrinthus.The original name, Ann knew, given to it by the Terran geologists staring at Mariner photos.But she didnt speak.The will to speech had left her.Michel talked on, his voice low and conversational, reassuring.Theres several places where if the road were cut it would be impossible to get the cars down.Transverse scarps that run from wall to wall, giant boulder fields, that kind of thing.Once we get into Marineris well be okay, theres all kinds of cross country routes there.Are these cars supplied for a drive down the whole canyon?Sax asked.No.Weve got caches all over the place, though.Apparently the great canyons had been some of the principal transport corridors for the hidden colony.When the official Canyon Highway was built it had caused them problems, cutting off a lot of their routes.From her corner Ann listened to Michel as attentively as the rest; she couldnt help being curious about the hidden colony.Their use of the canyons was ingenious.Rovers designed to stay down in them were disguised to look like one of the millions of boulders that lay in great talus piles sloping out from the cliffs.The roofs of the cars actually were boulders, hollowed out from below.Heavy insulation kept the rock roof of the car from heating up, so there was no IR signal, especially since theres still any number of Saxs windmills scattered around down here, and they confuse the picture.The rover was insulated on its underside as well, so that it left no snails track of heat to reveal its passing.The heat from the hydrazine motor was used to warm the living quarters, and any excess was directed into coils for later use; if they built up too much while moving, the coils were dropped into holes dug under the car, and buried with regolith.By the time the ground over the coil warmed up, the rover was long gone.So they left no heat signal, never used the radio, and moved only at night.During the day they sat in place among other boulders, and even if they compared daily photos and saw we were new in the area, we would just be one in a thousand new boulders that had fallen off the cliffs that night.Mass wasting has really accelerated since you started the terraforming, because its freezing and thawing every day.In the mornings and evenings theres something coming down every few minutes.So theres no way they can see us, Sax said, sounding surprised.Thats right.No visual signal, no electronic signal, no heat signal.A stealth rover, Frank said over the intercom from the other car, and laughed his harsh bray.Thats right.The real danger down here is the very rockfall thats hiding us.A red light on the dash went off, and Michel laughed.Were going so well well have to stop and bury a coil.Wont it take a while to dig a hole?Sax said.Theres one already dug, if we can get to it.Another four kilometers.I think well make it.You have quite a system here.Well, weve been living underground for fourteen years now, fourteen Martian years I mean.Thermal disposal engineering is a big thing for us.But how do you do it for your permanent habitats, assuming you have any?We pipe it down into the deep regolith, and melt ice for our water.Or else we pipe it out to vents disguised as your little windmill heaters.Among other methods.Those were a bad idea, Sax said.From the next car Frank laughed at him.Only thirty years late with that realization, Ann would have said if she were speaking.But no, an excellent idea!Michel said.They must have added millions of kilocalories to the atmosphere by now.About an hour from any of the moholes, Sax said primly.He and Michel began to discuss the terraforming projects.Ann let their voices drift into glossolalia; it was amazingly easy, conversations these days were always right on the edge of meaninglessness for her, she had to exert herself to understand rather than the reverse.She relaxed away from them, and felt Mars bounce and jumble under her.They stopped briefly to bury a heating coil.The road got smoother when they started again.They were deep in the labyrinth now, and in a normal rover she would have been looking through the skylights at tight steep canyon walls.Rift valleys, enlarged by slumping; there had been ice in this ground, once upon a time, now all migrated down to the Compton aquifer at the bottom of Noctis, presumably.Ann thought of Peter and shuddered helplessly.One couldnt assume things, but the fear gnawed at her.Simon watched her surreptitiously, the worry plain on his face, and suddenly she hated his doggy loyalty, his doggy love.She didnt want anyone to care for her like that, it was an unbearable burden, an imposition.At dawn they stopped.The two boulder rovers parked at the edge of a patch of similar boulders.All day they sat in one of the cars together, lingering over small rehydrated or microwaved meals, trying to find TV or radio transmissions.There werent any to speak of, only the occasional burst in a number of languages and encryptions.An ether junkyard, adding up to an incoherent mash.Harsh blasts of static seemed to indicate electromagnetic pulses.But the rovers electronics were hardened, Michel said.He sat in a chair as if meditating.A new calm for Michel Duval, Ann thought.As if he were used to waiting out his days in hiding.His companion, the youth driving the other car, was named Kasei.Kaseis voice had a permanent tone of grim disapproval.Well, they deserved it.In the afternoon Michel showed Sax and Frank where they were, on a topo map he clicked onto both cars screens.Their route through Noctis was to run a course southwest to northeast, along one of the biggest canyons of the labyrinth.Emerging from that it zigzagged eastward, dropping steeply until they were at the big area between Noctis and the heads of Ius and Tithonium Chasmas.Michel called this area the Compton Break.It was chaotic terrain, and until they had crossed it, and gotten down into Ius Chasma, Michel would not feel comfortable.For without their rough road, he said, the area was basically impassable.And if they figure we went this way out of Cairo, they may bomb the route.They had traveled nearly 500 kilometers the previous night, almost the whole length of Noctis; another good night and they would be down into Ius, and beyond their complete reliance on a single route.It was a dark day, the air thick with brown fines, the winds high.Another dust storm, no doubt about it.Temperatures were plummeting.Sax sniffed at a radio voice which claimed the dust storm was going global.Michel, however, was pleased.It meant they could travel during the day as well, cutting their travel time in half.Weve got five thousand kilometers to go, and most of it off road.It will be wonderful to be able to travel by day, I havent done that since the Great Storm.So he and Kasei began driving round the clock, taking shifts of three hours at the wheel followed by a half hour off.Another day and they were down the Compton Break, and into tight walled Ius Chasma, and Michel relaxed.Ius was the narrowest of all the canyons in the Marineris system, only twenty five kilometers wide when it left the Compton Break, dividing Sinai Planum from Tithania Catena.The canyon was a deep slash between these two plateaus, its side cliffs a full three kilometers high; a long, narrow giant of a rift.But they only saw the walls in glimpses, through bubbles of open air in the blowing dust.They continued to follow a level but rock strewn route, making good progress through all of a long dim day.It was quiet in the car, the radio turned down to decrease the irritation of the static.The cameras views, higher than the windows, were of dust whipping past them so that it seemed they hardly moved.Often it looked as if they were slewing sideways.It was hard driving, and Simon and Sax spelled Michel and Kasei, following their directions.Ann was still not talking, and they did not ask her to drive.Sax drove with one eye on his AI screen, which was giving him atmospheric readouts.She could tell from across the car that the AI was indicating that the impact of Phobos was thickening the atmosphere a great deal, projected to as much as a fifty millibar addition, an extraordinary amount.And the newly smashed craters were still outgassing.Sax noted this change with his owlish satisfaction, oblivious to the death and destruction that came with it.He noticed her glare and said, Like the Noachian Age, I suppose.He nearly added more, but Simon silenced him with a look, and changed the subject.In the next car Maya and Frank passed the hours by calling over and asking Michel questions about the hidden colony, or discussing with Sax the physical changes occurring, or speculating about the war.Hashing it all over endlessly, trying to make sense of it, to figure out what had happened.Talking talking talking.On Judgment Day, Ann thought, as all the quick and the dead staggered around together, Maya and Frank would still be talking, trying to figure out what had happened.Where they had gone wrong.Their third night out, the two cars ran down the lower end of Ius, and came to a long lemniscate fin dividing the canyon.They followed the official Marineris Highway down the south fork.In the last hour before dawn, they caught sight of some clouds overhead, and the dawn was much lighter than those of the previous days.It was enough to send them to cover, and they stopped in a fall of boulders stacked against the foot of the canyons south wall, and gathered in the lead car to wait out the day.Here they had a view out over the broad expanse of Melas Chasma, the biggest canyon of them all.Iuss rock was rough and blackish in comparison to the smooth red floor of Melas; it seemed to Ann possible that the two canyons were made of rock from ancient tectonic plates, once moving past each other, now juxtaposed forever.They sat through a long day, talked out, tense, exhausted, their hair oily and uncombed, their faces grimy with the ubiquitous red fines of a dust storm.Sometimes there were clouds, sometimes haze, sometimes sudden pockets of clarity.In mid afternoon, without any warning at all, the rover rocked on its shock absorbers.Startled to attention, they jerked up to look at the TVs.The rovers rear camera was pointed back up Ius, and suddenly Sax tapped the screen displaying its view.Frost, he said.I wonder ...The camera showed the frost steam thickening, moving down canyon toward them.The highway was up on a bench above the main floor of Iuss south fork; and this was lucky, because with a roar that shook the rover, that main floor disappeared, overwhelmed by a low wall of black water and dirty white mush.It was a juggernaut of ice chunks, tumbling rocks, foam, mud and water, a slurry throwing itself down the middle of the canyon.The roar was like thunder.Even inside the car it was too loud to talk, and the car trembled under them.Below their bench, the canyon floor proper was perhaps fifteen kilometers across.The flood filled this whole expanse in a matter of minutes, and promptly began to rise against a long talus slope that ran out from the cliff down canyon from them.The surface of the flood settled as it pooled against this dam, and froze solid as they watched: a lumpy discolored chaos of ice, strangely stilled.Now they could hear themselves shout over the cracks and booms and omnipresent roaring, but there was nothing to say.They only stared out the low windows or at the TVs, stunned.The frost steam coming off the floods surface lessened to a light fog.But no more than fifteen minutes later the ice lake burst at its lower end, rupturing in a surge of black steaming water that tore the talus dam away, with an explosive roar of avalanching rock.The flood poured down canyon again, its leading edge beyond their view, down the great slope from Ius into Melas Chasma.Now there was a river running down Valles Marineris, a broad, steaming, ice choked deluge.Ann had seen videotape of the outbreaks in the north, but she hadnt been able to get to one to see it in person.Here in the flesh, she found it almost impossible to grasp.The landscape itself was now speaking a kind of glossolalia.The inchoate roar smashed at the air, and quivered their stomachs like some bass tearing of the worlds fabric.And it was visual chaos as well, a meaningless jumble that she couldnt seem to focus on, to distinguish near from far, or vertical from horizontal, or moving from still, or light from dark.She was losing the ability to read meaning from her senses.Only with great difficulty could she understand her companions in the car.She wasnt sure if it was her hearing or not.She couldnt stand to look at Sax, but then Sax she at least understood.He was trying to hide it from her, but it was clear he was excited by what was happening.That calm dead exterior had always masked a passionate nature, and she had always known it.Now he was high colored as if he had a fever, and he never met her eye; he knew that she knew what he felt.She despised his shirking inability to confront her, even if it did arise from some kind of consideration for her.And the way he stayed always busy at his screen he never actually looked out the low floor windows of the rover, to see the flood with his own eyes.The cameras have a better view, he would say mildly when Michel urged him to have a look.And after only a half hour of watching the first arrival of the flood on the TVs, he had gone to his AI screen to work out what it might mean to his project.Water rushing down Ius, freezing, breaking up and rushing down again; certainly into Melas; whether there would be enough water to make it into Corprates, and then down into Capri and Eos, and then down into the Aureum Chaos ...it seemed unlikely on the face of it, but the Compton Aquifer had been big, one of the biggest ever found.Marineris very likely owed its existence to outbreaks from earlier incarnations of the same aquifer, and the Tharsis Bulge had never stopped outgassing ...She found she was lying on the floor of the rover, watching the flood, trying to comprehend it.She tried to calculate its flow in her head, just as a way to focus better on what she saw, to bring it back out of the meaninglessness that threatened to overwhelm her.Despite herself she felt the fascination of the calculation, and of the view, and even of the flood itself; this had happened on Mars before, billions of years ago, and probably just like this.There were signs of catastrophic floods all over, beach terraces, lemniscate islands, channel beds, scablands ...And the old broken aquifers had refilled, from the Tharsis upwelling and all the heat and outgassing that that engendered.It would have been slow, but give it two billion years....She forced herself to focus, to see.The near edge of the flood was about a kilometer away, and 200 meters below them.The foot of the northern wall of Ius was about fifteen kilometers away, and the flood stretched right to it.The flood was perhaps ten meters deep, judging by the giant boulders that rolled downstream like Big Mans bowling balls, smashing ice to shards and leaving steaming black polynyaps in their wake.The water in the open patches seemed to be moving at perhaps thirty kilometers an hour.So (punching figures into her wristpad) perhaps four and a half million cubic meters per hour.That was about a hundred Amazons out there, but running irregularly, freezing and bursting in a perpetual series of ice dams building and failing, whole steaming lakes leaping downhill over whatever channel or slope they found themselves on, stripping the land down to bedrock and then tearing the bedrock away....Lying on the floor of the rover, Ann could feel that assault in her cheekbones, vibrating the ground in a rapid pounding.Such tremors hadnt been felt on Mars in millions of years, which explained something else that she had seen but not been able to comprehend; the northern wall of Ius was moving.The rock of the cliffs was flaking off and falling into the canyon, which shook the ground, and triggered more collapses, and giant waves that washed out into the flood, water pouring back upstream over the ice, the rock bursting apart in explosions of hydration, the frost steam pouring so thickly into the dust choked air that she could see the northern wall only in snatches.And without a doubt the southern wall would be collapsing in a similar way, although their view of this wall, which loomed over their road to the right, was foreshortened and cut off.But it had to be falling.And if it flaked off above them, then they were dead for sure.It was quite possible very possible.Judging by her glimpses of the north wall, the chances might be as high as 50 percent.But then it was probably worse over there; the northern wall appeared to be undercut by the flood, while the south wall was removed from it by the bench they were driving over.So the southern cliffs should be a bit more stable  But then something drew her eye forward, downstream from them.Up there the south wall was indeed collapsing, falling in great sheets of rock.The base of the cliff exploded in a cloud of dust that bloomed over the talus, and the upper sections of the cliff slid down into this new cloud of dust and disappeared.After a second the whole mass reappeared flying horizontally out of the cloud, a strange sight.The noise was painfully loud, even inside the car; then it was just a long slow landslide down into the flood, the rocks crushing the ice and blocking the flow beneath.An instant dam, cutting off much of the flow down canyon; and so the banks of the flood began to rise.Ann watched the icy sheet of the shoreline below her rupture, and then it was chunks of ice, jostling in a sea of black smoking fizzing water, rising swiftly toward the rover.It would engulf them if the land slide dam lasted long enough.Ann peered at the long black spill of rock ahead of them; only a strip of it was still visible above the flood.But the slush beneath her continued to rise.It was a race of sorts.Big Mans bathtub, draining while he poured new bucketfuls in.The speed of the lakes ascent caused Ann to raise her estimate of the flow rate.She felt paralyzed, disconnected, in some curious sense serene; it was a matter of indifference to her whether or not the dam broke before the flood reached them.And in the overwhelming roar she felt no need to communicate with the others about this; it was impossible.She found that in a way she was cheering the flood on.It would serve them all right.But then the landslide dam disappeared under the discolored slurry, and it all rolled off downstream in a stately collapse, the short lived lake dropping as she watched, ice blocks on its surface clattering together, shrieking and booming as they collided and jumbled around and shot high into the air, all fantastically loud, every audible pitch roaring at once.It had to be well over a hundred decibels.She had her fingers in her ears.The car was bouncing up and down.She could see more landslides from the cliffs farther downstream, no doubt undercut by the sudden surge of the flood; the tremors they caused were triggering further collapses, until it looked like the whole canyon would fill.It seemed impossible in all the noise and vibration that their little cars would survive.The travelers clutched their chair arms or lay there on the floor like Ann, isolated by the roar, their veins pumping with an awful mix of ice and adrenaline; even Ann, who did not care, found her breath short and her muscles tensed against the kinetic assault.When they could hear each others shouts again, they asked Ann what had happened.Dully she stared out the window, ignoring them.Apparently they were going to survive, for the moment at least.The flood surface was now the most shattered chaotic terrain she had ever seen, the ice pulverized to a plain of wicked shards.The high point of the lake had climbed their bench until it had been only a hundred meters downslope from them; the reexposed wet ground down there had turned from rusty black to dirty white in less than twenty seconds.Freezing time on Mars.Sax had stayed in his seat through all that, absorbed by the flickering on his screen.A lot of water would evaporate, or rather freeze and sublime, he muttered to no one as he worked.It was very pure water, almost distilled, but it would end up as dust filled snow, falling somewhere else.The atmosphere might get hydrated enough so that it would snow several times, or even on a regular basis, in cycles of precipitation and sublimation.Thus the floodwater would get distributed pretty evenly planetwide, except perhaps at the highest altitudes.Albedo would rise dramatically.They would have to lower it, presumably by encouraging the snow algae that the Acheron group had created.(But there was no more Acheron, Ann said to him in her mind. )Black ice would melt by day, then freeze at night.Sublimate and precipitate.And thus they would have a waterscape: streams collecting, pooling, running downstream, freezing and expanding in cracks in the rock, subliming and snowing and melting and running again.A glaciated or muddy world, most of the time.But a waterscape nevertheless.And every single feature of the primal Mars would melt away.Red Mars was gone.Ann lay there on the floor by the window.Her tears poured out of her to join the flood; over the dam of her nose, downstream until her right cheek and ear and the whole side of her face was wet.This will complicate the process of getting down canyon, Michel said with a little Gallic smile, and from the next car Frank laughed.In fact it looked as if it would be impossible for them to proceed even five kilometers.Directly before them the canyon highway was buried under the great landslide, completely gone.The new spill of rock was shattered and unstable, sapped from below by the flood, pounded from above by subsequent mass wasting of the new slope.For a long time the others debated even making a try.They had to speak loudly to be heard over the jet engine roar of the flood, which still swept past with no sign of a let up.Nadia considered the slope suicidal, but Michel and Kasei were pretty sure they could find a way, and after a long days reconnaissance on foot they managed to convince Nadia to agree to try it, and the rest were willing if Nadia was.And so the day after that, protected from surveillance by the general dust storm and the floods steam, they divided into the two cars and drove slowly out onto the slide.It was a rough mass of gravel and sand, liberally sprinkled with boulders.There was, however, a zone corresponding to the bench below it, which was relatively level.This zone was the only thing that made passage possible; it was a matter of finding an unobstructed way over a surface like poorly mixed cement, around boulders and past the occasional gaping hole.Michel drove the lead car boldly, with a stubbornness verging on the reckless.Desperate measures, he declared cheerily.Can you imagine getting on this kind of ground in the normal course of things?It would be insane.Its insane now, Nadia said sourly.Well, what can we do?We cant go back, and we cant give up.These are the times that try mens souls.Women, however, do fine.I was quoting.You know what I mean.Theres simply no possibility of going back.The head of Ius will be flooded wall to wall.I suppose its this that makes me somehow happy.Have we ever been so free of choices?The past is wiped out, all that matters is now.The present and the future.And the future is this field of stones, and here we are.And, you know, you never really summon all of your strength until you know that theres no way back, no way to go but onward.And so onward they went.But Michels sanguinity was sharply reduced when the second car collapsed into a hole that had been concealed by a kind of trapdoor arrangement of boulders.With some work they were able to open the front lock and pull out Kasei, Maya, Frank and Nadia.But there was no chance whatsoever of freeing the second car, they didnt have the lift or the leverage.So they transferred all the supplies out of it, until the lead car was absolutely stuffed.And they moved on, eight of them and their supplies, all now in a single car.Beyond the landslide, however, it got easier.They followed the canyon highway down into Melas Chasma, and found that the road had been built close to the south wall, and as Melas was such a broad canyon the flood had had room to spread out, and had bowed off some ways to the north.It still sounded like air miners were running at full capacity right outside their lock, but the road was well above and to the south of the flood, which was releasing veils of frost steam that filled the chasm, and obscured any views farther north.So they proceeded without difficulty for a couple of nights, until they came to the Geneva Spur, which stuck out from the gigantic south wall nearly to the edge of the flood.Here the official road had swung out into what was now the course of the deluge, and they had to find a higher route.The rocky traverses they made around the lower slopes of the Spur were really difficult for the rover.Once they were nearly hung up on an obtruding rounded rock, and Maya shouted at Michel, accusing him of recklessness.She took over the driving while Michel and Kasei and Nadia went out in walkers.They jacked them off the rock, and then walked ahead to reconnoiter the route of the traverse.Frank and Simon helped Maya look for obstructions as she drove.Sax continued to spend all his time at his screen.From time to time Frank would turn on the TV and run a search for signals, trying to piece together news from the occasional staticky voices the radio found in the jamming.On the very spine of the Geneva Spur, as they were crossing the absurdly thin concrete thread of the Transcanyon Highway, they were far enough out from the south wall to get some transmissions, something about it not becoming a global dust storm after all.And indeed the days were sometimes only hazy, rather than clotted with the dust.Sax claimed this as proof of the relative success of the dust fixing strategies pursued since the Great Storm.No one responded to this.The haze that was in the air, Frank observed, seemed actually to help clarify weak radio signals.That was stochastic resonance, Sax said.The phenomenon was counterintuitive, and Frank questioned Sax closely for an explanation of it.When he understood, the room rang with his mirthless bray.Maybe all the emigration was stochastic resonance, enhancing the weak signal of the revolution.I dont think it helps to make analogies between the physical and social worlds, Sax said primly.Shut up, Sax.Go back to your virtual reality.Frank was still angry; bitterness sublimed from him like the frost steam off the flood.He snapped questions at Michel about the hidden colony, his curiosity bursting out two or three times a day.Ann was happy to think she would not be Hiroko when Frank first met her.Michel answered these accusing questions calmly, ignoring the sarcasm and the furious gleam in Franks eye.Mayas attempts to cool Frank only increased his rage, but she kept at it.Ann was impressed at how persistent she was, how insensitive to Franks brusque rejections.It was a side of Maya that Ann had never seen before; Maya was usually the most volatile person around.But not now, not when the pressure was really on.Eventually they rounded the Geneva Spur, and got back on the bench under the southern escarpment.The way east was often interrupted by landslides, but they always had room to veer left around them.Progress was good.But then they came to the eastern end of Melas.Here the greatest chasm of them all narrowed, and dropped several hundred meters down into the two parallel canyons of Coprates, which were separated by a long narrow plateau.South Coprates dead ended in a cliffy headwall some 250 kilometers away; North Coprates connected with the lower canyons farther east, and therefore was the one they wanted to take.North Coprates was the longest single segment of the Marineris system; Michel called it La Manche, and like the English Channel it narrowed as it progressed eastward, until at around 60  longitude it narrowed and reared into a gigantic gorge sheer cliffs four kilometers high, facing each other across a gap only twenty five kilometers across.Michel called this gorge the Dover Gate; apparently the cliff walls in this gap were whitish, or had been.So they made their way down North Coprates, and the cliffs closed in on them more every day.The flood filled almost the whole width of the canyon floor, and its flow was so rapid that the ice on its surface had broken into small bergs, which flew off the lips of standing waves and crashed back into the cascade: a furious white water rapid with the flow of a hundred Amazons, topped by icebergs.The canyon floor was being ripped away, torn free of its bed and rushing down in red jolts of water like massive pulses of rusty blood, as if the planet were bleeding to death.The noise was incredible, a roar so continuous and pervasive that it dulled thought, and made talk almost impossible; they had to shout everything at the top of their lungs, which quickly reduced them to communicating only the basic necessities.But then there was a very basic necessity to shout about, for when they came to the Dover Gate they found that the canyon floor was almost completely covered by the flood.Their bench below the southern wall of the gorge was no more than two kilometers wide, and diminishing every minute.It seemed possible the whole bench might be torn away in a flash.Maya cried that it was too dangerous to go on, and argued for a retreat.If they circled around and drove up to the dead end of South Coprates, she shouted, and managed to climb to the plateau above, then they could drive past the pits of Coprates, and proceed onward to Aureum.Michel shouted his insistence that they press forward, and get through the Gate on the bench.If we hurry we can make it!We must try!And when Maya continued to protest, he added forcefully, The head of South Coprates is steep!The car would never get up it, its a cliff like these!And we dont have the supplies to add so many extra days to our trip!We cant go back!The insane roar of the flood was his only answer.They sat in the car, in their separate thoughts, separated by the roar as if by many kilometers of space.Ann found herself wishing the bench would slide from under them, or a piece of the south wall fall onto them, and put an end to their indecision, and to the awful, maddening noise.They drove on.Frank and Maya and Simon and Nadia stood behind Michel and Kasei, watching them drive.Sax sat at his screen, stretching like a cat, staring myopically at the little picture of the deluge.The surface calmed for a moment, and froze over, and the explosive noise reduced to a violent low rumble.Its like the Grand Canyon on a kind of super Himalayan scale, Sax said, apparently to himself, although only Ann would be able to hear him.The Kala Gandaki Gorge is about three kilometers deep, isnt it?And Dhaulagiri and Annapurna only forty or fifty kilometers apart, I think.Fill that with a flood like ...He failed to recall any comparable flood.I wonder what all that water was doing so high on the Tharsis Bulge.Cracks like gunshots announced another surge.The white surface of the flood blew apart and tumbled downstream.White noise suddenly enveloped them, battening everything they said or thought, as if the universe were vibrating.A bass tuning fork ...Outgassing, Ann said.Outgassing.Her mouth was stiff, she could feel in her face how long it had been since she had last spoken.Tharsis rests on an upwelling of magma.Rock alone couldnt sustain the weight; the bulge would have subsided if it werent being supported by an upwelling current in the mantle.I thought there was no mantle.She could just hear him through the noise.No no.She didnt care if he could hear her or not.Its just slowed down.But currents are still there.And since the last great floods, they have refilled the high aquifers on Tharsis.And kept aquifers like Compton warm enough to stay liquid.Eventually the hydrostatic pressures were extreme.But with less vulcanism, and fewer big meteor strikes, nothing set it off.It might have been full for a billion years.Do you think Phobos broke it open?Maybe.More likely a reactor meltdown.Did you know Compton was this big?Sax asked.Yes.I never heard of it.No.Ann stared at him.Had he heard her say that?He had.Concealing data he was shocked, she could tell.He couldnt imagine any reason good enough to conceal data.Perhaps this was the root of their inability to understand each other.Value systems based on entirely different assumptions.Completely different kinds of science.He cleared his throat.Did you know it was liquid?I thought so.But now we know.Sax twitched, and called up on his screen the image from the left side camera.Black fizzing water, gray debris, shattered ice, boulders like great tumbling dice; standing waves freezing in place, collapsing and sweeping away in clouds of frost steam...the noise had risen back to its crackling jet howl.I wouldnt have done it this way!Sax exclaimed.Ann stared at him.He steadfastly regarded the TV.I know, she said.And then she was tired of talk again, tired of its uselessness.It had never been any more than it was now: whispers against the great roar of the world, half heard and less understood.They drove as quickly as they could through the Dover Gate, following the Calais Ramp as Michel called their bench.Progress was nerve rackingly slow, it was a bitter struggle to get the rover over the rockfall covering this narrow terrace; boulders were scattered everywhere, and the flood ate away at the land to their left, narrowing the bench at a perceptible rate.Landslides from the cliff walls fell ahead and behind them, and more than once individual rocks crashed into the cars roof, making them all jump.It was perfectly possible that a bigger rock would hit them and smash them like bugs, without a single bit of warning.That possibility subdued them all, which was fine by Ann.Even Simon left her alone, throwing himself into the navigational effort and going out on scouting trips with Nadia or Frank or Kasei, happy, she thought, to have some excuse to get away from her.And why not?They bumped along at a couple kilometers per hour.They traveled through a night and then the following day, even though the haze had diminished to the point where it was possible they were visible from satellites.There was no other choice.And then finally they were through the Dover Gate, and Coprates opened up again, giving them some leeway.The flood veered a few kilometers to the north.At dusk they stopped the car.They had been driving for some forty hours straight.They stood up and stretched, shuffled around, and then sat back down and ate a microwaved meal together.Maya, Simon, Michel and Kasei were in good spirits, cheerful to have gotten through the Gate; Sax was the same as always; Nadia and Frank a bit less grim than usual.The surface of the flood was frozen over for the moment, and it was possible to speak without hurting ones throat, and still be heard.And so they ate, concentrating on the small portions of food, talking in a desultory manner.Late in this quiet meal Ann looked around curiously at her companions, suddenly awed by the spectacle of human adaptability.Here they were eating their dinner, talking over the low boom from the north, in a perfect illusion of dining room conviviality; it might have been anywhere anytime, and their tired faces bright with some collective success, or merely with the pleasure of eating together while just outside their chamber the broken world roared, and rockfall could annihilate them at any instant.And it came to her that the pleasure and stability of dining rooms had always occurred against such a backdrop, against the catastrophic background of universal chaos; such moments of calm were things as fragile and transitory as soap bubbles, destined to burst almost as soon as they blew into existence.Groups of friends, rooms, streets, years, none of them would last.The illusion of stability was created by a concerted effort to ignore the chaos they were imbedded in.And so they ate, and talked, and enjoyed each others company; this was the way it had been in the caves, on the savannah, in the tenements and the trenches and the cities huddling under bombardment.And so, in this moment of the storm, Ann Clayborne exerted herself.She stood up, she went to the table.She picked up Saxs plate, Sax who had first drawn her out; and then Nadias and Simons.She carried the plates over to their little magnesium sink.And as she cleaned the dishes, she felt her stiff throat move; she croaked out her part of the conversation, and helped, with her little strand, to weave the human illusion.A stormy night!Michel said to her as he stood beside her drying plates, smiling.A stormy night indeed!The next morning she woke before the rest, and looked at the faces of her sleeping companions, now revealed in the daylight to be utterly disheveled grimy, puffy, black with frostnip, open mouthed in the total sleep of exhaustion.They looked dead.And she had been no help to them on the contrary!She had been a drag on the group; every time they had come back in the car they had had to step by the madwoman on the floor, lying there refusing to speak, often crying, clearly in the throes of severe depression.Just what they had needed!Ashamed, she got up and quietly finished cleaning up the main room and the drivers area.And later that day she took her turn driving the rover, doing a six hour shift and ending up exhausted.But she got them well east of the Dover Gate.Their troubles, however, were not over.Coprates had opened up a bit, yes, and the south wall had for the most part held.But in this area there was a long ridge, now an island, running down the middle of the canyon, dividing it into north and south channels; and unfortunately the southern channel was lower than the northern one, so that the bulk of the flood was running down it, and crowding them tight against the southern wall.Happily the bench terrace gave them some five kilometers between the deluge and the wall proper; but with the flood so close on their left, and the steep cliffs on their right, they never lost the sense of danger.And they had to raise their voices to talk at least half the time; the crackling roar of the surges seemed to invade their heads, making it harder than ever to concentrate, or to pay attention, or indeed to think at all.One day Maya crashed her fist against the table and cried, Couldnt we wait for the island ridge to get torn away?After an awkward pause Kasei said, Its a hundred kilometers long.Well, shit couldnt we just wait until this flood stops?I mean, how long can it go on like this?A few months, Ann said.Cant we wait that long?Were running low on food, Michel explained.We have to keep going, Frank snapped at Maya.Dont be stupid.She glared at him and turned away, clearly furious.The rover suddenly seemed much too small, as if a bunch of tigers and lions had been thrown together in a dogs kennel.Simon and Kasei, oppressed by the tension, suited up and went out to scout what lay ahead.Beyond what they called Island Ridge, Coprates opened up like a funnel, with deep troughs under the diverging canyon walls.The northern trough was Capri Chasma, and the southern trough was Eos Chasma, which ran on as a continuation of Coprates.Because of the flood they had no choice but to follow Eos, but Michel said it was the way they would have wanted anyway.Here the southern cliff finally lowered a bit, and was cut with deep embayments, and shattered by a couple of good sized meteor craters.Capri Chasma curved out of their sight to the northeast; between the two trough canyons was a low triangular mesa, now a peninsula dividing the course of the flood in two.Unfortunately the great bulk of the water ran into the somewhat lower Eos, so that even though they were out of the tight constriction of Coprates, they were still pressed against a cliff, and moving slowly, off any road or trail, and with diminishing supplies of food and gases.The cupboards were nearly bare.They were tired, very tired.It had been twenty three days since they had escaped from Cairo, now 2,500 kilometers up canyon; and all that time they had been sleeping in shifts, and driving almost constantly, and living in the aural assault of the flood, the roar of a world falling down in pieces on their heads.They were too old for this, as Maya said more than once, and nerves were frayed; they were fudging things, making little mistakes, falling into little microbursts of sleep.The bench that was their road between cliff and flood became an immense boulder field, the boulders mostly ejecta from nearby craters, or detritus from really extensive mass wasting.It looked to Ann like the big fluted and scalloped embayments in the southern cliff were sappings that would initiate tributary subsidence canyons; but she didnt have the time to look very closely.Often it seemed that they were going to have their way blocked entirely by boulders, that after all these days and kilometers, after negotiating most of Marineris in the midst of a most violent cataclysm, they were going to be halted just short of the tremendous washes leading out of its lower end.But then they found a way; and were stopped; and found a way; and were stopped; and found a way; and so on, for day after day after day.They went to half rations.Ann drove more than anyone else, as she seemed to be fresher than the rest, and was the best driver there anyway with the possible exception of Michel.And she felt she owed it to them after her shameful collapse during the greater part of their journey.She wanted to do everything she could, and when she wasnt driving, she went out to scout the way.It was still numbingly loud outside, and the ground trembled underfoot.It was impossible to get used to that, though she did her best to ignore it.Sunlight burned through the mist and haze in broad lurid splashes, and in the sunset hour icebows and sundogs appeared in the sky, along with rings of light around the dulled sun; often the whole sky seemed afire, a Turner vision of the apocalypse.Soon enough Ann too wore down, and the work became exhausting.She understood now why her companions had been so tired, why they had been so short with her and with each other.Michel had been unable to locate the last three caches they had passed buried or drowned, it didnt matter.The half rations were 1,200 calories a day, much less than they were expending.Lack of food, lack of sleep: and then, for Ann at least, the same old depression, persistent as death, rising in her like a flood, like a black slurry of mud, steam, ice, shit.Doggedly she kept at the work, but her attention kept blinking out and the glossolalia kept returning, washing everything away in the white noise of despair.The way got harder.One day they made only a kilometer.The following day they seemed completely stopped, the boulders arrayed across the bench like tank stoppers in Big Mans Maginot Line.It was a perfect fractal plane, Sax remarked, of about 2.7 dimensions.No one bothered to answer him.Kasei, wandering on foot, found a passage right down on the bank of the flood.For the moment the whole visible expanse of the deluge was frozen, as it had been for the last couple of days.It stretched out to the horizon, a jumbled surface like Earths Arctic Sea, only much dirtier, a great mix of black and red and white lumps.The ice just offshore was flat, however, and in many places clear.They could look down into it, and see that it appeared to be only a couple of meters deep, and frozen right down to the bottom.So they drove down to this icy shore and ran along it, and when rocks in the way forced her to, Ann put the left wheels of the rover out onto the ice, and then the entire car; and it held like any other surface.Nadia and Maya snorted at the others nervousness about this course: We spent all winter driving on the rivers in Siberia, Nadia said.They were the best roads we had.So for an entire day Ann drove along the ragged edge of the flood, and out onto its surface, and they made 160 kilometers, their best day in two weeks.Near sunset it began to snow.The west wind poured out of Coprates, driving big gritty clumps of snow past them as if they werent moving at all.They came to a fresh slide zone, which spilled right out onto the ice of the flood.Big boulders scattered over the ice gave it the air of an abandoned neighborhood.The light was dusky gray.They needed a foot guide through this maze, and in an exhausted conference Frank volunteered, and went out to do the job.At this point he was the only one of them with any strength left, more even than the younger Kasei; still boiling with the heat of his anger, a breeder fuel that would never give out.Slowly he walked ahead of the car, testing routes and returning, either shaking his head or waving Ann on.Around them thin veils of frost steam lofted into the falling snow, the two mixing and gusting off together on the powerful evening wind, off into the murk.Watching the dark spectacle of one hard gust, Ann misread the configuration of the ices meeting with the ground, and the rover ran up onto a round rock right at the frozen shoreline, lifting the left rear wheel off the ground.Ann gunned the front wheels to roll them over the rock, but they dug into a patch of sand and snow, and suddenly both rear wheels were barely touching the ground, while the front two merely spun in the holes they had dug.She had run the rover aground.It had happened before several times, but she was annoyed with herself for getting distracted by the irrelevant spectacle of the sky.What the fuck are you doing?Frank shouted over the intercom.Ann jumped in her chair; she would never get used to Franks biting vehemence.Get going!he shouted.I ran it onto a rock, she said.Damn you!Why dont you watch where youre going!Here, stop the wheels, stop them!Im gonna put the grip cloths under the front wheels and lever you forward, and then you get it off this rock and up the slope as quick as you can, understand?Theres another surge coming!Frank!Maya cried.Get inside!Soon as I get the fucking pads down!Be ready to go!The pads were strips of spiked metal mesh, set under wheels that had dug holes into sand, and then pegged out ahead so that the wheels had something to grip.An ancient desert method, and Frank ran around the front of the rover cursing under his breath and snapping directions to Ann, who obeyed with her teeth clenched and her stomach knotted.Okay, go!Frank shouted.Go!Get in first!Ann cried.Theres no time, go, its almost here!Ill hang on the side, go, damn it, go!So Ann gently accelerated the front wheels, and felt them catch on the grips and scrape the car forward over the rock, until the rear wheels touched down again and they scraped off and were free.But the roar of the flood suddenly doubled and redoubled behind them, and then there were chunks of ice bounding past the car, bursting along with a hideous cracking, and then the ice was overwhelmed by a dark wave of steaming bubbling slurry, a surge that washed up over the windows of the car.Ann floored the accelerator and held the wheel with a death grip as it bounced in her hands.Mixed with the crashing of the surge wave she heard Franks voice shouting Go, idiot, go!and then they were hit hard and the car slewed off to the left, out of control.Ann hung onto the wheel as it threw her from side to side.Her left ear throbbed with pain, she had hit something with it.She held on to the wheel and kept her foot jamming the accelerator to the floor.The wheels caught on something and the rover ground through water, it poured from right to left and there was a dull banging against the side of the car.Go!She kept the accelerator floored and turned uphill, bouncing wildly in the drivers seat, all the windows and TV screens liquid madness.Then the water ran under the rover, and the windows were clear.The rovers headlights showed rocky ground, falling snow, and ahead a bare flat area.Ann kept it floored and jounced wildly toward it, the flood still roaring behind them.When she reached the flat rise she had to pull her leg and foot away from the accelerator with her hands.The car stopped.They were above the flood, on a narrow bench terrace.It looked like the surge was already receding.But Frank Chalmers was gone.Maya insisted that they return and look for him, and as it was likely that the initial surge would be the largest one they did so, but it was futile.In the twilight the headlights cut fifty meters into the snowfall, and in the two intersecting yellow cones, and the dark gray world outside them, they saw only the ragged surface of the flood, a pouring sea of flotsam and jetsam without the slightest hint of any regular shape; in fact it looked like a world in which such shapes were impossible.No one could survive in such madness.Frank was gone, either knocked off the car in its jouncing, or swept off it in its brief and nearly fatal encounter with the wave.His final curses still seemed to bubble out of the static on the intercom, out of the roar of the flood.His final imprecation rang in Anns ears like the judgment it was: Go, idiot, go!It had been her fault, all her fault  Maya was weeping, choking on sobs, doubling over her stomach as if cramping.No!she cried.Frank, Frank!We have to look for him!Then she was crying too hard to speak.Sax went over and dug into the medicine chest, and walked over to her and crouched by her side.Here, Maya, do you want a sedative?And she uncoiled and dashed the pills from his hand, No!she screamed, theyre my feelings, theyre my men, do you think Im a coward, do you think I would want to be a zombie like you!She collapsed into helpless, involuntary, racking sobs.Sax stood over her, blinking, face twisted with a stricken look; Ann found herself cut to the quick by that look, Please, she said.Please, please.She got up from the drivers seat, went back to them and held Sax briefly by the arm.She crouched to help Nadia and Simon pick Maya up off the floor, and get her to her bed.Already Maya was quieter, withdrawing from them, her eyes red and her nose running, off in her own grief, one hand clenched in a death grip over Nadias wrist.Nadia looked down at her with a doctors detached expression, withdrawn in her own way, murmuring in Russian.Maya, Im sorry, Ann said.Her throat was cramped, it hurt to talk.It was my fault.Im sorry.Maya shook her head.It was an accident.Ann couldnt bring herself to say aloud that she had stopped paying attention.The words stuck in her throat, and another spasm of sobs racked Maya, and the chance to speak was gone.Michel and Kasei took over the drivers seats, and started the rover along the bench again.Not far east of that, the southern canyon wall finally sank down into the surrounding plain, and they were free to move away from the flood, which was in any case following Eos Chasma in a swing to the north, off to a distant reunion with Capri Chasma.Michel ran across the hidden colonys trail, but lost it again, as the trail ducks were often buried in snow.He tried throughout all one day to locate a cache he thought was nearby, but failed.Rather than waste more time they decided to drive on at full speed, a bit north of east, toward the refuge they had been trying to reach, which Michel said was in the broken terrain just south of Aureum Chaos.Its not our main colony anymore, he explained to the others.Its where we went first, after we left Underhill.But Hiroko wanted to leave for the south, and after a few years we did.She said she didnt like this first shelter because Aureum is a sink, and she thought it might become a lake someday.I thought that was crazy, but I see now that she was right.It looks like Aureum may even be the final drainage for this flood, I dont know.But the refuge is at a higher elevation than we are now, so it will be okay.It may be empty of people, but it will be stocked with supplies.And any port in a storm, yes?No one had the spirit to reply.On the second day of hard driving the flood disappeared over the horizon to the north.The roar of it went away soon after.The ground, covered with a meter of dirty snow, no longer trembled underfoot; the world seemed dead, strangely silent and still, shrouded in white.When it wasnt snowing the sky was still hazy, but it seemed clear enough for them to be spotted from above, so they stopped traveling by day.They moved at night without headlights, across a snowscape that glowed faintly under the stars.Ann drove through these nights.She never told anyone about her moment of inattention at the wheel.And she never even came close to doing it again; she stayed focused with a desperate concentration, biting the inside of her mouth till it bled, oblivious to everything but what lay in the cones of light before her.She usually drove all night, forgetting to wake the next watchs driver, or deciding not to.Frank Chalmers was dead, and it was her fault; desperately she wished she could reach back and change things, but it was hopeless.Some mistakes you can never make good.The white landscape was marred by an infinity of stones, each capped with its own cake of snow, and the salt and pepper landscape was such a patchwork that it was hard at night for the eye to make sense of it; sometimes they seemed to be plowing underground, or floating five meters over it.A white world.Some nights she understood she was driving a hearse, across the body of the deceased.The widows Nadia and Maya in back.And now she knew that Peter was dead too.Twice she heard Frank calling out to her over the intercom, once asking for her to turn back and help him; the other crying, Go, idiot, go!Maya was bearing up well.She was tough, somehow, despite all her moods.Nadia, whom Ann used to think of as the tough one, was silent most of the time.Sax stared at his screen and worked.Michel tried to talk to his old friends, and gave up unhappily when it was clear no one wanted to talk back.Simon watched Ann anxiously as always, with unbearable concern; she couldnt stand it, and avoided his gaze.Poor Kasei must have felt like he was trapped in an asylum for the aged insane, it was almost funny to think of it, except that his spirit seemed to be somehow broken, she did not know why, perhaps the waste, perhaps the increasing likelihood that they would not survive; perhaps simple hunger, there was no way of telling.The young were odd.But he reminded her of Peter, and so she didnt look at him either.The snow made each night glow and pulse.All of it would melt eventually, carve new streambeds and carry her Mars away.Mars was gone.Michel sat beside her through the second shifts of the night, looking for signs of the way.Are we lost?Maya asked him once, just before dawn.No, not at all.Its just...were leaving tracks in the snow.I dont know how long theyll last, or how visible they are, but if...Well, just in case they do last, I want to leave the car, and walk the last part of the way.So I want to be precisely sure of where we are before we do that.Weve got some standing stones and dolmens erected that will tell us for sure, but I have to find one of those first.Theyll show on the horizon, you know.Boulders a bit taller than usual, or columns.It will be easier to see those by day, Simon said.True.Well have a look around tomorrow, and that should do it well be in an area of them.They were designed to help people lost like us.Well be okay.Except that their friends were dead.Her only child was dead.And their world was gone for good.Lying down by the windows at dawn, Ann tried to imagine life in the hidden shelter.Underground for years and years.She couldnt do it.Go, idiot, go!Damn you!At dawn Kasei hooted with hoarse triumph: out there on the northern horizon was a trio of standing stones.A lintel bridging two pillars, as if a single fragment of Stonehenge had flown here.Home was that way, said Kasei.But first they would wait through the day.Michel was becoming extremely cautious about being seen from satellites, and wanted to continue on by night.They settled down to get some sleep.Ann couldnt sleep, she found herself energized by a new resolve.When the rest were out cold, Michel snoring happily, all of them asleep for the first time in about fifty hours, she tugged into her walker and tiptoed into the lock.She looked back and surveyed them; a hungry, ragged lot.Nadias crippled hand stuck out from her side.Getting out the lock made some unavoidable noise, but everyone was used to sleeping through noise, and the whirrs and clicks of the life support system partially covered her exit.She got out without waking anyone.The planets basal chill.She shuddered in it, and set off west, walking in the rovers tracks so she couldnt be followed.The sun was cutting through the mist.Snow was falling again, tinted pink in shafts of sunlight.She trudged along until she came on a little drumlin ridge, with its steep side clear of snow.She could traverse along the bare rock without leaving tracks.She did so until she got tired.It was really cold out, the snow falling straight down in tiny flakes, probably accreted around sand grains.At the end of the drumlin was a fat low boulder.She sat in its lee.She turned off her walkers heating unit, and covered the blinking alarm light on her wristpad with a clump of snow.It got colder fast.The sky was an opaque gray now, tinged with faint pink.Snow fell out of the pinkness onto her faceplate.She had just stopped shivering, and was getting comfortably chill, when a boot kicked her hard in the helmet, and she was dragged up to her knees with her head ringing.A suited figure banged its faceplate into hers, hard.Then hands with a vises grip took her by the shoulders and flung her down to the ground.Hey, she cried weakly.She was yanked by her shoulders to her feet, and her left arm was pulled back and held up high behind her back.Her assailant worked at her wristpad, and then shoved her painfully forward, her arm still held high.She couldnt fall without breaking her arm.She could feel the diamond pattern of her suits heating elements begin to flare against her skin, burning their pattern into her.Every few steps she was slapped hard in the helmet.The figure marched her right back to their own rover, which astonished her.She was shoved into the lock, and the figure tumbled in after her, and closed and pumped the chamber, and tore off her helmet, and then his, and to her utter amazement it was her Simon, purple faced and shouting at her, striking her still, his face soaking wet with tears this her Simon, the quiet one, now yelling at her, Why?Why?Damn you, you always do this, its always just you you you, off in your own world, you are so selfish!Voice rising to a final painful shriek, her Simon who never said anything, never raised his voice, never spoke more than a word, now striking her and shrieking in her face, literally spitting, gasping with fury; and suddenly it made her mad.Why not before, why not when she had needed someone with some life in him?Why had it taken this to rouse him?She punched him right in the chest, hard, and he fell back.Leave me alone, she shouted.Leave me alone!And then the anguish shuddered through her, the chilled shiver of Martian death: Why didnt you leave me alone?He regained his balance, lunged forward and seized her by both shoulders, shook her.She had never noticed how powerful his hands were.Because, he shouted, and paused to lick his lips and catch his breathBecause And his eyes bugged out, and his face darkened even further, as if a thousand sentences had all jammed in his throat at once, this her mild Simon!and then he gave up on saying it, and roared, and shook her in his arms, shouting Because!Because!Because!Snow fell.Though it was early morning, it was dim.Wind whipped across the chaos, swirling the spindrift over the shattered land.Boulders as big as city blocks lay jumbled against each other, and the landscape was broken in a million little cliffs, holes, mesas, ridges, peaks also many peculiar spikes and towers and balancing rocks, held in place by kami alone.All the steep or vertical stone in this chaotic terrain was still black, white flatter areas were now white with snow, so that the landscape was a densely variegated black and white, all swirling in and out of visibility as billows and veils of snow gusted by.Then the snow stopped.The wind died.The black verticals and white horizontals gave the world a definition it didnt usually have.In the overcast there were no shadows, and the landscape glowed as if light were pouring up through the snow onto the bottoms of the dusky low clouds.Everything was sharp edged and distinct, as if captured in glass.Over the horizon appeared moving figures.One by one they appeared, until there were seven of them, in a ragged line.They moved slowly, their shoulders slumped, their helmets bent forward.They moved as if they had no destination.The two in front looked up from time to time, but they never paused, or pointed the way.The western clouds gleamed like mother of pearl, the only sign on that dull day that the sun was lowering.The figures walked up a long ridge that emerged from the blasted landscape.From the upper slopes of the ridge one could see a long way in every direction.It took a long time for the figures to climb the ridge.Finally they approached a peak, a bouldery knob where the ridge began to descend again.At the summit of the knob was a curious thing: a big flat bottomed boulder standing high in the air, balanced on six slender stone pillars.The seven figures approached this megalith.They stopped and regarded it for a time, under the dark bruised clouds.Then they stepped between the pillars, and under the boulder.It stood well over them, a massive roof.The circular floor beneath it was flat, made of cut polished stone.One of the figures walked to a far column, and touched it with a finger.The others looked out at the motionless snowy chaos.A trapdoor slid open in the floor.The figures went to it, and one by one stepped down into the ridge.When they were gone the six slender columns began to sink into the floor, and the great dolmen that they held aloft descended on them, until the columns disappeared and the great rock rested on the ridge, returned to its ancient existence as an impressive peak boulder.Beyond the clouds the sun had set, and the light leaked out of the empty land.It was Maya who kept them going, Maya who drove them into heading south.The refuge under the dolmen was just that, a sequence of small caves in the ridge, stocked with emergency rations and gas supplies, but otherwise empty.After a few days to rest and catch up on sleep and food, Maya began to complain.It was no way to live, she said, it was no more than a kind of death in life; where were all the others?Where was Hiroko?Michel and Kasei explained again that the hidden colony was in the south, that they had moved down there long ago.All right, Maya said, then we will go south too.There were other boulder cars in the refuges garage, they could caravan down by night, she said, and out of the canyons they would be safe.The refuge was no longer self sustaining in any case, its supplies were large but limited, so they would have to go sooner or later.Best to go while the dust storm would still provide some cover for the trip.Best to go.So she drove the tired little group to action.They loaded two cars, and took off again, south across the great rumpled plains of Margaritifer Sinus.Free from the restrictions of Marineris, they made hundreds of kilometers per night, and slept through the days, and in a nearly speechless journey of several days they passed between Argyre and Hellas, through the endless craterland of the southern highlands.It began to seem that they had never done anything but drive onward in their little cars, that the journey would last forever.But then one night they drove onto the layered terrain of the polar region, and near dawn the horizon ahead gleamed, and then became a dim white bar, which thickened and thickened as they proceeded, until it was a white cliff standing before them.The southern polar cap, evidently.Michel and Kasei took over the two drivers seats, and conferred over the intercom in low voices.They drove on until they reached the white cliff, and they continued to drive straight at it, until they were on frozen crusted sand that was under the bulk of the ice.The cliff was an enormous overhang, like a wave stopped in the moment it was about to crash onto a beach.There was a tunnel cut into the ice at the bottom of the cliff, and a figure in a walker appeared and directed the two rovers into it.The tunnel led them straight into the ice for what must have been a kilometer at least.The tunnel was wide enough for two or three rovers, and had a low ceiling.The ice around them was a pure white, dry ice only lightly streaked by stratification.They passed through two locks filling the tunnel, and in the third lock Michel and Kasei stopped the rovers, and opened their locks, and climbed down.Maya, Nadia, Sax, Simon and Ann followed them out of the cars.They passed through a lock door and walked down the tunnel in silence.Then the tunnel opened up and they all stopped, stilled by the sight that met them.Overhead was an enormous dome of gleaming white ice.They stood under it as if under a giant overturned bowl.The dome was several kilometers in diameter, and at least a kilometer high, maybe more; it rose swiftly from the perimeters, and then bowled gently across the center.The light was diffuse but fairly strong, as if on a cloudy day, and it seemed to come from the white dome itself, which gleamed.The ground under the dome was gently rolling reddish sand, grassy in the hollows, with frequent stands of tall bamboo and gnarled pine.There were some small hillocks to the right, and clustered in these hills was a little village, one  and two story houses painted white and blue, interspersed with large trees which had bamboo rooms and staircases set in their thick branches.Michel and Kasei were walking toward this village, and the woman who had guided their cars into the tunnel lock was running ahead, shouting Theyre here, theyre here!Under the other side of the dome there was a lake of faintly steaming open water, its surface a white sheen lined by waves that broke on the near shore.On the far shore stood the blue bulk of a Rickover, its reflection a smear of blue across the white water.Gusts of cold damp wind nipped at their ears.Michel came back and retrieved his old friends, who were standing like statues.Come on, its cold out, he said with a smile.Theres a water ice layer stuck to the dome, so we have to keep the air below freezing all the time.People were spilling out of the village, calling out.Down by the little lake a young man appeared sprinting toward them, gazelling over the dunes in great leaps.Even after all their years on Mars such a flying run still looked dreamlike to the first hundred, and it took a while before Simon clutched Ann by the arm and cried Thats Peter!Thats Peter!Peter, she said.And then they were in a crush of people, many of them young folk and children, strangers, but with familiar faces everywhere making their way to the fore, Hiroko and Iwao, Raul, Rya, Gene, Peter crashing in to hug Ann and Simon, and there were Vlad and Ursula and Marina and several others from the Acheron group, all clustered around them, reaching to touch them.What is this place?Maya cried.This is home, Hiroko said.This is where we start again.
