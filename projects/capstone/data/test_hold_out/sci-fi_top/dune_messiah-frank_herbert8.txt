"Beloved, there was no way to spare you this.Believe me. "Chani stilled a fit of trembling when he aimed those empty sockets at her.She'd given up asking him to explain.He spoke so oddly: "I was baptized in sand and it cost me the knack of believing.Who trades in faiths anymore?Who'll buy?Who'll sell?"What could he mean by such words?He refused even to consider Tleilaxu eyes, although he bought them with a lavish hand for the men who'd shared his affliction.Hunger satisfied, Chani slipped from bed, glanced back at Paul, noted his tiredness.Grim lines framed his mouth.The dark hair stood up, mussed from a sleep that hadn't healed.He appeared so saturnine and remote.The back and forth of waking and sleeping did nothing to change this.She forced herself to turn away, whispered: "My love...my love...  "He leaned over, pulled her back into the bed, kissed her cheeks."Soon we'll go back to our desert," he whispered."Only a few things remain to be done here. "She trembled at the finality in his voice.He tightened his arms around her, murmured: "Don't fear me, my Sihaya.Forget mystery and accept love.There's no mystery about love.It comes from life.Can't you feel that?""Yes. "She put a palm against his chest, counting his heartbeats.His love cried out to the Fremen spirit in her   torrential, outpouring, savage.A magnetic power enveloped her."I promise you a thing, beloved," he said."A child of ours will rule such an empire that mine will fade in comparison.Such achievements of living and art and sublime  "  "We're here now!"she protested, fighting a dry sob."And...I feel we have so little...time. ""We have eternity, beloved. ""You may have eternity.I have only now. ""But this is eternity. "He stroked her forehead.She pressed against him, lips on his neck.The pressure agitated the life in her womb.She felt it stir.Paul felt it, too.He put a hand on her abdomen, said: "Ahh, little ruler of the universe, wait your time.This moment is mine. "She wondered then why he always spoke of the life within her as singular.Hadn't the medics told him?She searched back in her own memory, curious that the subject had never arisen between them.Surely, he must know she carried twins.She hesitated on the point of raising this question.He must know.He knew everything.He knew all the things that were herself.His hands, his mouth   all of him knew her.Presently, she said: "Yes, love.This is forever...this is real. "And she closed her eyes tightly lest sight of his dark sockets stretch her soul from paradise to hell.No matter the rihani magic in which he'd enciphered their lives, his flesh remained real, his caresses could not be denied.When they arose to dress for the day, she said: "If the people only knew your love... "But his mood had changed."You can't build politics on love," he said."People aren't concerned with love; it's too disordered.They prefer despotism.Too much freedom breeds chaos.We can't have that, can we?And how do you make despotism lovable?""You're not a despot!"she protested, tying her scarf."Your laws are just. ""Ahh, laws," he said.He crossed to the window, pulled back the draperies as though he could look out."What's law?Control?Law filters chaos and what drips through?Serenity?Law   our highest ideal and our basest nature.Don't look too closely at the law.Do, and you'll find the rationalized interpretations, the legal casuistry, the precedents of convenience.You'll find the serenity, which is just another word for death. "Chani's mouth drew into a tight line.She couldn't deny his wisdom and sagacity, but these moods frightened her.He turned upon himself and she sensed internal wars.It was as though he took the Fremen maxim, "Never to forgive   never to forget," and whipped his own flesh with it.She crossed to his side, stared past him at an angle.The growing heat of the day had begun pulling the north wind out of these protected latitudes.The wind painted a false sky full of ochre plumes and sheets of crystal, strange designs in rushing gold and red.High and cold, the wind broke against the Shield Wall with fountains of dust.Paul felt Chani's warmth beside him.Momentarily, he lowered a curtain of forgetfulness across his vision.He might just be standing here with his eyes closed.Time refused to stand still for him, though.He inhaled darkness   starless, tearless.His affliction dissolved substance until all that remained was astonishment at the way sounds condensed his universe.Everything around him leaned on his lonely sense of hearing, falling back only when he touched objects: the drapery, Chani's hand...He caught himself listening for Chani's breaths.Where was the insecurity of things that were only probable?he asked himself.His mind carried such a burden of mutilated memories.For every instant of reality there existed countless projections, things fated never to be.An invisible self within him remembered the false pasts, their burden threatening at times to overwhelm the present.Chani leaned against his arm.He felt his body through her touch: dead flesh carried by time eddies.He reeked of memories that had glimpsed eternity.To see eternity was to be exposed to eternity's whims, oppressed by endless dimensions.The oracle's false immortality demanded retribution: Past and Future became simultaneous.Once more, the vision arose from its black pit, locked onto him.It was his eyes.It moved his muscles.It guided him into the next moment, the next hour, the next day...until he felt himself to be always there!"It's time we were going," Chani said."The Council... ""Alia will be there to stand in my place. ""Does she know what to do?""She knows. "Alia's day began with a guard squadron swarming into the parade yard below her quarters.She stared down at a scene of frantic confusion, clamorous and intimidating babble.The scene became intelligible only when she recognized the prisoner they'd brought: Korba, the Panegyrist.She made her morning toilet, moving occasionally to the window, keeping watch on the progress of impatience down there.Her gaze kept straying to Korba.She tried to remember him as the rough and bearded commander of the third wave in the battle of Arrakeen.It was impossible.Korba had become an immaculate fop dressed now in a Parato silk robe of exquisite cut.It lay open to the waist, revealing a beautifully laundered ruff and embroidered undercoat set with green gems.A purple belt gathered the waist.The sleeves poking through the robe's armhole slits had been tailored into rivulet ridges of dark green and black velvet.A few Naibs had come out to observe the treatment accorded a fellow Fremen.They'd brought on the clamor, exciting Korba to protest his innocence.Alia moved her gaze across the Fremen faces, trying to recapture memories of the original men.The present blotted out the past.They'd all become hedonists, samplers of pleasures most men couldn't even imagine.Their uneasy glances, she saw, strayed often to the doorway into the chamber where they would meet.They were thinking of Muad'dib's blind sight, a new manifestation of mysterious powers.By their law, a blind man should be abandoned in the desert, his water given up to Shai hulud.But eyeless Muad'dib saw them.They disliked buildings, too, and felt vulnerable in space built above the ground.Give them a proper cave cut from rock, then they could relax   but not here, not with this new Muad'dib waiting inside.As she turned to go down to the meeting, she saw the letter where she'd left it on a table by the door: the latest message from their mother.Despite the special reverence held for Caladan as the place of Paul's birth, the Lady Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj."No doubt my son is an epochal figure of history," she'd written, "but I cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion. "Alia touched the letter, experienced an odd sensation of mutual contact.This paper had been in her mother's hands.Such an archaic device, the letter   but personal in a way no recording could achieve.Written in the Atreides Battle Tongue, it represented an almost invulnerable privacy of communication.Thinking of her mother afflicted Alia with the usual inward blurring.The spice change that had mixed the psyches of mother and daughter forced her at times to think of Paul as a son to whom she had given birth.The capsule complex of oneness could present her own father as a lover.Ghost shadows cavorted in her mind, people of possibility.Alia reviewed the letter as she walked down the ramp to the antechamber where her guard amazons waited."You produce a deadly paradox," Jessica had written."Government cannot be religious and self assertive at the same time.Religious experience needs a spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress.And you cannot govern without laws.Your laws eventually must replace morality, replace conscience, replace even the religion by which you think to govern.Sacred ritual must spring from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality.Government, on the other hand, is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts, questions and contentions.I see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and symbolism replaces morality. "The smell of spice coffee greeted Alia in the antechamber.Four guard amazons in green watchrobes came to attention as she entered.They fell into step behind her, striding firmly in the bravado of their youth, eyes alert for trouble.They had zealot faces untouched by awe.They radiated that special Fremen quality of violence: they could kill casually with no sense of guilt.In this, I am different, Alia thought.The Atreides name has enough dirt on it without that.Word preceded her.A waiting page darted off as she entered the lower hall, running to summon the full guard detail.The hall stretched out windowless and gloomy, illuminated only by a few subdued glowglobes.Abruptly, the doors to the parade yard opened wide at the far end to admit a glaring shaft of daylight.The guard with Korba in their midst wavered into view from the outside with the light behind them."Where is Stilgar?"Alia demanded."Already inside," one of her amazons said.Alia led the way into the chamber.It was one of the Keep's more pretentious meeting places.A high balcony with rows of soft seats occupied one side.Across from the balcony, orange draperies had been pulled back from tall windows.Bright sunlight poured through from an open space with a garden and a fountain.At the near end of the chamber on her right stood a dais with a single massive chair.Moving to the chair, Alia glanced back and up, saw the gallery filled with Naibs.Household guardsmen packed the open space beneath the gallery, Stilgar moving among them with a quiet word here, a command there.He gave no sign that he'd seen Alia enter,  Korba was brought in, seated at a low table with cushions beside it on the chamber floor below the dais.Despite his finery, the Panegyrist gave the appearance now of a surly, sleepy old man huddled up in his robes as against the outer cold.Two guardsmen took up positions behind him.Stilgar approached the dais as Alia seated herself."Where is Muad'dib?"he asked."My brother has delegated me to preside as Reverend Mother," Alia said.Hearing this, the Naibs in the gallery began raising their voices in protest."Silence!"Alia commanded.In the abrupt quiet, she said: "Is it not Fremen law that a Reverend Mother presides when life and death are at issue?"As the gravity of her statement penetrated, stillness came over the Naibs, but Alia marked angry stares across the rows of faces.She named them in her mind for discussion in Council   Hobars, Rajifiri, Tasmin, Saajid, Umbu, Legg...The names carried pieces of Dune in them: Umbu Sietch, Tasmin Sink, Hobars Gap...She turned her attention to Korba.Observing her attention, Korba lifted his chin, said: "I protest my innocence. ""Stilgar, read the charges," Alia said.Stilgar produced a brown spicepaper scroll, stepped forward.He began reading, a solemn flourish in his voice as though to hidden rhythms.He gave the words an incisive quality, clear and full of probity:  "...that you did conspire with traitors to accomplish the destruction of our Lord and Emperor; that you did meet in vile secrecy with diverse enemies of the realm; that you...  "Korba kept shaking his head with a look of pained anger.Alia listened broodingly, chin planted on her left fist, head cocked to that side, the other arm extended along the chair arm.Bits of the formal procedure began dropping out of her awareness, screened by her own feelings of disquiet."...venerable tradition...support of the legions and all Fremen everywhere...violence met with violence according to the Law...majesty of the Imperial Person...forfeit all rights to... "It was nonsense, she thought.Nonsense!All of it   nonsense...nonsense...nonsense...Stilgar finished: "Thus the issue is brought to judgment. "In the immediate silence, Korba rocked forward, hands gripping his knees, veined neck stretched as though he were preparing to leap.His tongue flicked between his teeth as he spoke."Not by word or deed have I been traitor to my Fremen vows!I demand to confront my accuser!"A simple enough protest, Alia thought.And she saw that it had produced a considerable effect on the Naibs.They knew Korba.He was one of them.To become a Naib, he'd proved his Fremen courage and caution.Not brilliant, Korba, but reliable.Not one to lead a Jihad, perhaps, but a good choice as supply officer.Not a crusader, but one who cherished the old Fremen virtues: The Tribe is paramount.Otheym's bitter words as Paul had recited them swept through Alia's mind.She scanned the gallery.Any of those men might see himself in Korba's place   some for good reason.But an innocent Naib was as dangerous as a guilty one here.Korba felt it, too."Who accuses me?"he demanded."I have a Fremen right to confront my accuser. ""Perhaps you accuse yourself," Alia said.Before he could mask it, mystical terror lay briefly on Korba's face.It was there for anyone to read: With her powers, Alia had but to accuse him herself, saying she brought the evidence from the shadow region, the alam al mythal."Our enemies have Fremen allies," Alia pressed."Water traps have been destroyed, qanats blasted, plantings poisoned and storage basins plundered... ""And now   they've stolen a worm from the desert, taken it to another world!"The voice of this intrusion was known to all of them   Muad'dib.Paul came through the doorway from the hall, pressed through the guard ranks and crossed to Alia's side.Chani, accompanying him, remained on the sidelines."M'Lord," Stilgar said, refusing to look at Paul's face.Paul aimed his empty sockets at the gallery, then down to Korba."What, Korba   no words of praise?"Muttering could be heard in the gallery.It grew louder, isolated words and phrases audible: "...law for the blind...Fremen way...in the desert...who breaks... ""Who says I'm blind?"Paul demanded.He faced the gallery."You, Rajifiri?I see you're wearing gold today, and that blue shirt beneath it which still has dust on it from the streets.You always were untidy. "Rajifiri made a warding gesture, three fingers against evil."Point those fingers at yourself!"Paul shouted."We know where the evil is!"He turned back to Korba."There's guilt on your face, Korba. ""Not my guilt!I may've associated with the guilty, but no...  "He broke off, shot a frightened look at the gallery.Taking her cue from Paul, Alia arose, stepped down to the floor of the chamber, advanced to the edge of Korba's table.From a range of less than a meter, she stared down at him, silent and intimidating.Korba cowered under the burden of eyes.He fidgeted, shot anxious glances at the gallery."Whose eyes do you seek up there?"Paul asked."You cannot see!"Korba blurted.Paul put down a momentary feeling of pity for Korba.The man lay trapped in the vision's snare as securely as any of those present.He played a part, no more."I don't need eyes to see you," Paul said.And he began describing Korba, every movement, every twitch, every alarmed and pleading look at the gallery.Desperation grew in Korba.Watching him, Alia saw he might break any second.Someone in the gallery must realize how near he was to breaking, she thought.Who?She studied the faces of the Naibs, noting small betrayals in the masked faces...angers, fears, uncertainties...guilts.Paul fell silent.Korba mustered a pitiful air of pomposity to plead: "Who accuses me?""Otheym accuses you," Alia said."But Otheym's dead!"Korba protested."How did you know that?"Paul asked."Through your spy system?Oh, yes!We know about your spies and couriers.We know who brought the stone burner here from Tarahell. ""It was for the defense of the Qizarate!"Korba blurted."Is that how it got into traitorous hands?"Paul asked."It was stolen and we... "Korba fell silent, swallowed.His gaze darted left and right."Everyone knows I've been the voice of love for Muad'dib. "He stared at the gallery."How can a dead man accuse a Fremen?""Otheym's voice isn't dead," Alia said.She stopped as Paul touched her arm."Otheym sent us his voice," Paul said."It gives the names, the acts of treachery, the meeting places and the times.Do you miss certain faces in the Council of Naibs, Korba?Where are Merkur and Fash?Keke the Lame isn't with us today.And Takim, where is he?"Korba shook his head from side to side."They've fled Arrakis with the stolen worm," Paul said."Even if I freed you now, Korba, Shai hulud would have your water for your part in this.Why don't I free you, Korba?Think of all those men whose eyes were taken, the men who cannot see as I see.They have families and friends, Korba.Where could you hide from them?""It was an accident," Korba pleaded."Anyway, they're getting Tleilaxu...  "Again, he subsided."Who knows what bondage goes with metal eyes?"Paul asked.The Naibs in their gallery began exchanging whispered comments, speaking behind raised hands.They gazed coldly at Korba now."Defense of the Qizarate," Paul murmured, returning to Korba's plea."A device which either destroys a planet or produces J rays to blind those too near it.Which effect, Korba, did you conceive as a defense?Does the Qizarate rely on stopping the eyes of all observers?""It was a curiosity, m'Lord," Korba pleaded."We knew the Old Law said that only Families could possess atomics, but the Qizarate obeyed...obeyed...  ""Obeyed you," Paul said."A curiosity, indeed. ""Even if it's only the voice of my accuser, you must face me with it!"Korba said."A Fremen has rights. ""He speaks truth, Sire," Stilgar said.Alia glanced sharply at Stilgar."The law is the law," Stilgar said, sensing Alia's protest.He began quoting Fremen Law, interspersing his own comments on how the Law pertained.Alia experienced the odd sensation she was hearing Stilgar's words before he spoke them.How could he be this credulous?Stilgar had never appeared more official and conservative, more intent on adhering to the Dune Code.His chin was outthrust, aggressive.His mouth chopped.Was there really nothing in him but this outrageous pomposity?"Korba is a Fremen and must be judged by Fremen Law," Stilgar concluded.Alia turned away, looked out at the day shadows dropping down the wall across from the garden.She felt drained by frustration.They'd dragged this thing along well into midmorning.Now, what?Korba had relaxed.The Panegyrist's manner said he'd suffered an unjust attack, that everything he'd done had been for love of Muad'dib.She glanced at Korba, surprised a look of sly self importance sliding across his face.He might almost have received a message, she thought.He acted the part of a man who'd heard friends shout: "Hold fast!Help is on its way!"For an instant, they'd held this thing in their hands   the information out of the dwarf, the clues that others were in the plot, the names of informants.But the critical moment had flown.Stilgar?Surely not Stilgar.She turned, stared at the old Fremen.Stilgar met her gaze without flinching."Thank you, Stil," Paul said, "for reminding us of the Law. "Stilgar inclined his head.He moved close, shaped silent words in a way he knew both Paul and Alia could read.I'll wring him dry and then take care of the matter.Paul nodded, signaled the guardsmen behind Korba."Remove Korba to a maximum security cell," Paul said."No visitors except counsel.As counsel, I appoint Stilgar. ""Let me choose my own counsel!"Korba shouted.Paul whirled."You deny the fairness and judgment of Stilgar?""Oh, no, m'Lord, but...  ""Take him away!"Paul barked.The guardsmen lifted Korba off the cushions, herded him out.With new mutterings, the Naibs began quitting their gallery.Attendants came from beneath the gallery, crossed to the windows and drew the orange draperies.Orange gloom took over the chamber."Paul," Alia said."When we precipitate violence," Paul said, "it'll be when we have full control of it.Thank you, Stil; you played your part well.Alia, I'm certain, has identified the Naibs who were with him.They couldn't help giving themselves away. ""You cooked this up between you?"Alia demanded."Had I ordered Korba slain out of hand, the Naibs would have understood," Paul said."But this formal procedure without strict adherence to Fremen Law   they felt their own rights threatened.Which Naibs were with him, Alia?""Rajifiri for certain," she said, voice low."And Saajid, but...  ""Give Stilgar the complete list," Paul said.Alia swallowed in a dry throat, sharing the general fear of Paul in this moment.She knew how he moved among them without eyes, but the delicacy of it daunted her.To see their forms in the air of his vision!She sensed her person shimmering for him in a sidereal time whose accord with reality depended entirely on his words and actions.He held them all in the palm of his vision!"It's past time for your morning audience, Sire," Stilgar said."Many people   curious...afraid... ""Are you afraid, Stil?"It was barely a whisper: "Yes. ""You're my friend and have nothing to fear from me," Paul said.Stilgar swallowed."Yes, m'Lord. ""Alia, take the morning audience," Paul said."Stilgar, give the signal. "Stilgar obeyed.A flurry of movement erupted at the great doors.A crowd was pressed back from the shadowy room to permit entrance of officials.Many things began happening all at once: the household guard elbowing and shoving back the press of Supplicants, garishly robed Pleaders trying to break through, shouts, curses.Pleaders waved the papers of their calling.The Clerk of the Assemblage strode ahead of them through the opening cleared by the guard.He carried the List of Preferences, those who'd be permitted to approach the Throne.The Clerk, a wiry Fremen named Tecrube, carried himself with weary cynicism, flaunting his shaven head, clumped whiskers.Alia moved to intercept him, giving Paul time to slip away with Chani through the private passage behind the dais.She experienced a momentary distrust of Tecrube at the prying curiosity in the stare he sent after Paul."I speak for my brother today," she said."Have the Supplicants approach one at a time. ""Yes, m'Lady. "He turned to arrange his throng."I can remember a time when you wouldn't have mistaken your brother's purpose here," Stilgar said."I was distracted," she said."There's been a dramatic change in you, Stil.What is it?"Stilgar drew himself up, shocked.One changed, of course.But dramatically?This was a particular view of himself that he'd never encountered.Drama was a questionable thing.Imported entertainers of dubious loyalty and more dubious virtue were dramatic.Enemies of the Empire employed drama in their attempts to sway the fickle populace.Korba had slipped away from Fremen virtues to employ drama for the Qizarate.And he'd die for that."You're being perverse," Stilgar said."Do you distrust me?"The distress in his voice softened her expression, but not her tone."You know I don't distrust you.I've always agreed with my brother that once matters were in Stilgar's hands we could safely forget them. ""Then why do you say I've...changed?""You're preparing to disobey my brother," she said."I can read it in you.I only hope it doesn't destroy you both. "The first of the Pleaders and Supplicants were approaching now.She turned away before Stilgar could respond.His face, though, was filled with the things she'd sensed in her mother's letter   the replacement of morality and conscience with law."You produce a deadly paradox. "= = = = = =   Tibana was an apologist for Socratic Christianity, probably a native of IV Anbus who lived between the eight and ninth centuries before Corrino, likely in the second reign of Dalamak.Of his writings, only a portion survives from which this fragment is taken: "The hearts of all men dwell in the same wilderness. "from The Dunebuk of Irulan   "You are Bijaz," the ghola said, entering the small chamber where the dwarf was held under guard."I am called Hayt. "A strong contingent of the household guard had come in with the ghola to take over the evening watch.Sand carried by the sunset wind had stung their cheeks while they crossed the outer yard, made them blink and hurry.They could be heard in the passage outside now exchanging the banter and ritual of their tasks."You are not Hayt," the dwarf said."You are Duncan Idaho.I was there when they put your dead flesh into the tank and I was there when they removed it, alive and ready for training. "The ghola swallowed in a throat suddenly dry.The bright glowglobes of the chamber lost their yellowness in the room's green hangings.The light showed beads of perspiration on the dwarf's forehead.Bijaz seemed a creature of odd integrity, as though the purpose fashioned into him by the Tleilaxu were projected out through his skin.There was power beneath the dwarf's mask of cowardice and frivolity."Muad'dib has charged me to question you to determine what it is the Tleilaxu intend you to do here," Hayt said."Tleilaxu, Tleilaxu," the dwarf sang."I am the Tleilaxu, you dolt!For that matter, so are you. "Hayt stared at the dwarf.Bijaz radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observer think of ancient idols."You hear that guard outside?"Hayt asked."If I gave them the order, they'd strangle you. ""Hai!Hai!"Bijaz cried."What a callous lout you've become.And you said you came seeking truth. "Hayt found he didn't like the look of secret repose beneath the dwarf's expression."Perhaps I only seek the future," he said."Well spoken," Bijaz said."Now we know each other.When two thieves meet they need no introduction. ""So we're thieves," Hayt said."What do we steal?""Not thieves, but dice," Bijaz said."And you came here to read my spots.I, in turn, read yours.And lo!You have two faces!""Did you really see me go into the Tleilaxu tanks?"Hayt asked, fighting an odd reluctance to ask that question."Did I not say it?"Bijaz demanded.The dwarf bounced to his feet."We had a terrific struggle with you.The flesh did not want to come back. "Hayt felt suddenly that he existed in a dream controlled by some other mind, and that he might momentarily forget this to become lost in the convolutions of that mind.Bijaz tipped his head slyly to one side, walked all around the ghola, staring up at him."Excitement kindles old patterns in you," Bijaz said."You are the pursuer who doesn't want to find what he pursues. ""You're a weapon aimed at Muad'dib," Hayt said, swiveling to follow the dwarf."What is it you're to do?""Nothing!"Bijaz said, stopping."I give you a common answer to a common question. ""Then you were aimed at Alia," Hayt said."Is she your target?""They call her Hawt, the Fish Monster, on the out worlds," Bijaz said."How is it I hear your blood boiling when you speak of her?""So they call her Hawt," the ghola said, studying Bijaz for any clue to his purpose.The dwarf made such odd responses."She is the virgin harlot," Bijaz said."She is vulgar, witty, knowledgeable to a depth that terrifies, cruel when she is most kind, unthinking while she thinks, and when she seeks to build she is as destructive as a coriolis storm. ""So you came here to speak out against Alia," Hayt said."Against her?"Bijaz sank to a cushion against the wall."I came here to be captured by the magnetism of her physical beauty. "He grinned, a saurian expression in the big featured face."To attack Alia is to attack her brother," Hayt said."That is so clear it is difficult to see," Bijaz said."In truth, Emperor and sister are one person back to back, one being half male and half female. ""That is a thing we've heard said by the Fremen of the deep desert," Hayt said."And those are the ones who've revived the blood sacrifice to Shai hulud.How is it you repeat their nonsense?""You dare say nonsense?"Bijaz demanded."You, who are both man and mask?Ahh, but the dice cannot read their own spots.I forget this.And you are doubly confused because you serve the Atreides double being.Your senses are not as close to the answer as your mind is. ""Do you preach that false ritual about Muad'dib to your guards?"Hayt asked, his voice low.He felt his mind being tangled by the dwarf's words."They preach to me!"Bijaz said."And they pray.Why should they not?All of us should pray.Do we not live in the shadow of the most dangerous creation the universe has ever seen?""Dangerous creation... ""Their own mother refuses to live on the same planet with them!""Why don't you answer me straight out?"Hayt demanded."You know we have other ways of questioning you.We'll get our answers...one way or another. ""But I have answered you!Have I not said the myth is real?Am I the wind that carries death in its belly?No!I am words!Such words as the lightning which strikes from the sand in a dark sky.I have said: 'Blow out the lamp!Day is here!'And you keep saying: 'Give me a lamp so I can find the day. '"  "You play a dangerous game with me," Hayt said."Did you think I could not understand these Zensunni ideas?You leave tracks as clear as those of a bird in mud. "Bijaz began to giggle."Why do you laugh?"Hayt demanded."Because I have teeth and wish I had not," Bijaz managed between giggles."Having no teeth, I could not gnash them. ""And now I know your target," Hayt said."You were aimed at me. ""And I've hit it right on!"Bijaz said."You made such a big target, how could I miss?"He nodded as though to himself."Now I will sing to you. "He began to hum, a keening, whining monotonous theme, repeated over and over.Hayt stiffened, experiencing odd pains that played up and down his spine.He stared at the face of the dwarf, seeing youthful eyes in an old face.The eyes were the center of a network of knobby white lines which ran to the hollows below his temples.Such a large head!Every feature focused on the pursed up mouth from which that monotonous noise issued.The sound made Hayt think of ancient rituals, folk memories, old words and customs, half forgotten meanings in lost mutterings.Something vital was happening here   a bloody play of ideas across Time.Elder ideas lay tangled in the dwarfs singing.It was like a blazing light in the distance, coming nearer and nearer, illuminating life across a span of centuries."What are you doing to me?"Hayt gasped."You are the instrument I was taught to play," Bijaz said."I am playing you.Let me tell you the names of the other traitors among the Naibs.They are Bikouros and Cahueit.There is Djedida, who was secretary to Korba.There is Abumojandis, the aide to Bannerjee.Even now, one of them could be sinking a blade into your Muad'dib. "Hayt shook his head from side to side.He found it too difficult to talk."We are like brothers," Bijaz said, interrupting his monotonous hum once more."We grew in the same tank: I first and then you. "Hayt's metal eyes inflicted him with a sudden burning pain.Flickering red haze surrounded everything he saw.He felt he had been cut away from every immediate sense except the pain, and he experienced his surroundings through a thin separation like windblown gauze.All had become accident, the chance involvement of inanimate matter.His own will was no more than a subtle, shifting thing.It lived without breath and was intelligible only as an inward illumination.With a clarity born of desperation, he broke through the gauze curtain with the lonely sense of sight.His attention focused like a blazing light under Bijaz.Hayt felt that his eyes cut through layers of the dwarf, seeing the little man as a hired intellect, and beneath that, a creature imprisoned by hungers and cravings which lay huddled in the eyes   layer after layer, until finally, there was only an entity aspect being manipulated by symbols."We are upon a battleground," Bijaz said."You may speak of it. "His voice freed by the command, Hayt said: "You cannot force me to slay Muad'dib. ""I have heard the Bene Gesserit say," Bijaz said, "that there is nothing firm, nothing balanced, nothing durable in all the universe   that nothing remains in its state, that each day, sometimes each hour, brings change. "Hayt shook his head dumbly from side to side."You believed the silly Emperor was the prize we sought," Bijaz said."How little you understand our masters, the Tleilaxu.The Guild and Bene Gesserit believe we produce artifacts.In reality, we produce tools and services.Anything can be a tool   poverty, war.War is useful because it is effective in so many areas.It stimulates the metabolism.It enforces government.It diffuses genetic strains.It possesses a vitality such as nothing else in the universe.Only those who recognize the value of war and exercise it have any degree of self determination. "In an oddly placid voice, Hayt said: "Strange thoughts coming from you, almost enough to make me believe in a vengeful Providence.What restitution was exacted to create you?It would make a fascinating story, doubtless with an even more extraordinary epilogue. ""Magnificent!"Bijaz chortled."You attack   therefore you have willpower and exercise self determination. ""You're trying to awaken violence in me," Hayt said in a panting voice.Bijaz denied this with a shake of the head."Awaken, yes; violence, no.You are a disciple of awareness by training, so you have said.I have an awareness to awaken in you, Duncan Idaho. ""Hayt!""Duncan Idaho.Killer extraordinary.Lover of many women.Swordsman soldier.Atreides field hand on the field of battle.Duncan Idaho. ""The past cannot be awakened. ""Cannot?""It has never been done!""True, but our masters defy the idea that something cannot be done.Always, they seek the proper tool, the right application of effort, the services of the proper  "  "You hide your real purpose!You throw up a screen of words and they mean nothing!""There is a Duncan Idaho in you," Bijaz said."It will submit to emotion or to dispassionate examination, but submit it will.This awareness will rise through a screen of suppression and selection out of the dark past which dogs your footsteps.It goads you even now while it holds you back.There exists that being within you upon which awareness must focus and which you will obey. ""The Tleilaxu think I'm still their slave, but I  "  "Quiet, slave!"Bijaz said in that whining voice.Hayt found himself frozen in silence."Now we are down to bedrock," Bijaz said."I know you feel it.And these are the power words to manipulate you...I think they will have sufficient leverage. "Hayt felt the perspiration pouring down his cheeks, the trembling of his chest and arms, but he was powerless to move."One day," Bijaz said, "the Emperor will come to you.He will say: 'She is gone. 'The grief mask will occupy his face.He will give water to the dead, as they call their tears hereabouts.And you will say, using my voice: 'Master!Oh, Master!'"  Hayt's jaw and throat ached with the locking of his muscles.He could only twist his head in a brief arc from side to side."You will say, 'I carry a message from Bijaz. '" The dwarf grimaced."Poor Bijaz, who has no mind...poor Bijaz, a drum stuffed with messages, an essence for others to use...pound on Bijaz and he produces a noise...  "Again, he grimaced."You think me a hypocrite.Duncan Idaho!I am not!I can grieve, too.But the time has come to substitute swords for words. "A hiccup shook Hayt.Bijaz giggled, then: "Ah, thank you, Duncan, thank you.The demands of the body save us.As the Emperor carries the blood of the Harkonnens in his veins, he will do as we demand.He will turn into a spitting machine, a biter of words that ring with a lovely noise to our masters. "Hayt blinked, thinking how the dwarf appeared like an alert little animal, a thing of spite and rare intelligence.Harkonnen blood in the Atreides?"You think of Beast Rabban, the vile Harkonnen, and you glare," Bijaz said."You are like the Fremen in this.When words fail, the sword is always at hand, eh?You think of the torture inflicted upon your family by the Harkonnens.And, through his mother, your precious Paul is a Harkonnen!You would not find it difficult to slay a Harkonnen, now would you?"Bitter frustration coursed through the ghola.Was it anger?Why should this cause anger?"Ohhh," Bijaz said, and: "Ahhhh, hah!Click click.There is more to the message.It is a trade the Tleilaxu offer your precious Paul Atreides.Our masters will restore his beloved.A sister to yourself   another ghola. "Hayt felt suddenly that he existed in a universe occupied only by his own heartbeats."A ghola," Bijaz said."It will be the flesh of his beloved.She will bear his children.She will love only him.We can even improve on the original if he so desires.Did ever a man have greater opportunity to regain what he'd lost?It is a bargain he will leap to strike. "Bijaz nodded, eyes drooping as though tiring.Then: "He will be tempted...and in his distraction, you will move close.In the instant, you will strike!Two gholas, not one!That is what our masters demand!"The dwarf cleared his throat, nodded once more, said: "Speak. ""I will not do it," Hayt said."But Duncan Idaho would," Bijaz said."It will be the moment of supreme vulnerability for this descendant of the Harkonnens.Do not forget this.You will suggest improvements to his beloved   perhaps a deathless heart, gentler emotions.You will offer asylum as you move close to him   a planet of his choice somewhere beyond the Imperium.Think of it!His beloved restored.No more need for tears, and a place of idyls to live out his years. ""A costly package," Hayt said, probing."He'll ask the price. ""Tell him he must renounce his godhead and discredit The Qizarate.He must discredit himself, his sister. ""Nothing more?"Hayt asked, sneering."He must relinquish his CHOAM holdings, naturally. ""Naturally. ""And if you're not yet close enough to strike, speak of how much the Tleilaxu admire what he has taught them about the possibilities of religion.Tell him the Tleilaxu have a department of religious engineering, shaping religions to particular needs. ""How very clever," Hayt said."You think yourself free to sneer and disobey me," Bijaz said.He cocked his head slyly to one side."Don't deny it... ""They made you well, little animal," Hayt said."And you as well," the dwarf said."You will tell him to hurry.Flesh decays and her flesh must be preserved in a cryological tank. "Hayt felt himself floundering, caught in a matrix of objects he could not recognize.The dwarf appeared so sure of himself!There had to be a flaw in the Tleilaxu logic.In making their ghola, they'd keyed him to the voice of Bijaz, but...But what?Logic/matrix/object...How easy it was to mistake clear reasoning for correct reasoning!Was Tleilaxu logic distorted?Bijaz smiled, listened as though to a hidden voice."Now, you will forget," he said."When the moment comes, you will remember.He will say: 'She is gone.
