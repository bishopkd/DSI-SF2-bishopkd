 LOG ENTRY: SOL 6  Im pretty much fucked.Thats my considered opinion.Fucked.Six days into what should be the greatest two months of my life, and its turned into a nightmare.I dont even know wholl read this.I guess someone will find it eventually.Maybe a hundred years from now.For the record I didnt die on Sol 6.Certainly the rest of the crew thought I did, and I cant blame them.Maybe therell be a day of national mourning for me, and my Wikipedia page will say, Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars.And itll be right, probably.Cause Ill surely die here.Just not on Sol 6 when everyone thinks I did.Lets see where do I begin?The Ares Program.Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to another planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of humanity blah, blah, blah.The Ares 1 crew did their thing and came back heroes.They got the parades and fame and love of the world.Ares 2 did the same thing, in a different location on Mars.They got a firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee when they got home.Ares 3.Well, that was my mission.Okay, not mine per se.Commander Lewis was in charge.I was just one of her crew.Actually, I was the very lowest ranked member of the crew.I would only be in command of the mission if I were the only remaining person.What do you know?Im in command.I wonder if this log will be recovered before the rest of the crew die of old age.I presume they got back to Earth all right.Guys, if youre reading this: It wasnt your fault.You did what you had to do.In your position I would have done the same thing.I dont blame you, and Im glad you survived.I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this.We got to Earth orbit the normal way, through an ordinary ship to Hermes.All the Ares missions use Hermes to get to and from Mars.Its really big and cost a lot so NASA built only one.Once we got to Hermes, four additional unmanned missions brought us fuel and supplies while we prepared for our trip.Once everything was a go, we set out for Mars.But not very fast.Gone are the days of heavy chemical fuel burns and trans Mars injection orbits.Hermes is powered by ion engines.They throw argon out the back of the ship really fast to get a tiny amount of acceleration.The thing is, it doesnt take much reactant mass, so a little argon (and a nuclear reactor to power things) let us accelerate constantly the whole way there.Youd be amazed at how fast you can get going with a tiny acceleration over a long time.I could regale you with tales of how we had great fun on the trip, but I wont.I dont feel like reliving it right now.Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days later without strangling each other.From there, we took the MDV (Mars descent vehicle) to the surface.The MDV is basically a big can with some light thrusters and parachutes attached.Its sole purpose is to get six humans from Mars orbit to the surface without killing any of them.And now we come to the real trick of Mars exploration: having all of our shit there in advance.A total of fourteen unmanned missions deposited everything we would need for surface operations.They tried their best to land all the supply vessels in the same general area, and did a reasonably good job.Supplies arent nearly so fragile as humans and can hit the ground really hard.But they tend to bounce around a lot.Naturally, they didnt send us to Mars until theyd confirmed that all the supplies had made it to the surface and their containers werent breached.Start to finish, including supply missions, a Mars mission takes about three years.In fact, there were Ares 3 supplies en route to Mars while the Ares 2 crew were on their way home.The most important piece of the advance supplies, of course, was the MAV.The Mars ascent vehicle.That was how we would get back to Hermes after surface operations were complete.The MAV was soft landed (as opposed to the balloon bounce fest the other supplies had).Of course, it was in constant communication with Houston, and if there had been any problems with it, we would have passed by Mars and gone home without ever landing.The MAV is pretty cool.Turns out, through a neat set of chemical reactions with the Martian atmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen you bring to Mars, you can make thirteen kilograms of fuel.Its a slow process, though.It takes twenty four months to fill the tank.Thats why they sent it long before we got here.You can imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered the MAV was gone.It was a ridiculous sequence of events that led to me almost dying, and an even more ridiculous sequence that led to me surviving.The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts up to 150 kph.So Houston got understandably nervous when we got whacked with 175 kph winds.We all got in our flight space suits and huddled in the middle of the Hab, just in case it lost pressure.But the Hab wasnt the problem.The MAV is a spaceship.It has a lot of delicate parts.It can put up with storms to a certain extent, but it cant just get sandblasted forever.After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort.Nobody wanted to stop a monthlong mission after only six days, but if the MAV took any more punishment, wed all have gotten stranded down there.We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the MAV.That was going to be risky, but what choice did we have?Everyone made it but me.Our main communications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting torn from its foundation and carried with the torrent.Along the way, it crashed through the reception antenna array.Then one of those long thin antennae slammed into me end first.It tore through my suit like a bullet through butter, and I felt the worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side.I vaguely remember having the wind knocked out of me (pulled out of me, really) and my ears popping painfully as the pressure of my suit escaped.The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly reaching out toward me.I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit.A steady, obnoxious beeping that eventually roused me from a deep and profound desire to just fucking die.The storm had abated; I was facedown, almost totally buried in sand.As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasnt more dead.The antenna had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but it had been stopped by my pelvis.So there was only one hole in the suit (and a hole in me, of course).I had been knocked back quite a ways and rolled down a steep hill.Somehow I landed facedown, which forced the antenna to a strongly oblique angle that put a lot of torque on the hole in the suit.It made a weak seal.Then, the copious blood from my wound trickled down toward the hole.As the blood reached the site of the breach, the water in it quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving a gunky residue behind.More blood came in behind it and was also reduced to gunk.Eventually, it sealed the gaps around the hole and reduced the leak to something the suit could counteract.The suit did its job admirably.Sensing the drop in pressure, it constantly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to equalize.Once the leak became manageable, it only had to trickle new air in slowly to relieve the air lost.After a while, the CO2 (carbon dioxide) absorbers in the suit were expended.Thats really the limiting factor to life support.Not the amount of oxygen you bring with you, but the amount of CO2 you can remove.In the Hab, I have the oxygenator, a large piece of equipment that breaks apart CO2 to give the oxygen back.But the space suits have to be portable, so they use a simple chemical absorption process with expendable filters.Id been asleep long enough that my filters were useless.The suit saw this problem and moved into an emergency mode the engineers call bloodletting.Having no way to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then backfilled with nitrogen.Between the breach and the bloodletting, it quickly ran out of nitrogen.All it had left was my oxygen tank.So it did the only thing it could to keep me alive.It started backfilling with pure oxygen.I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity, as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to burn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes.An ironic death for someone with a leaky space suit: too much oxygen.Every step of the way would have had beeping alarms, alerts, and warnings.But it was the high oxygen warning that woke me.The sheer volume of training for a space mission is astounding.Id spent a week back on Earth practicing emergency space suit drills.I knew what to do.Carefully reaching to the side of my helmet, I got the breach kit.Its nothing more than a funnel with a valve at the small end and an unbelievably sticky resin on the wide end.The idea is you have the valve open and stick the wide end over a hole.The air can escape through the valve, so it doesnt interfere with the resin making a good seal.Then you close the valve, and youve sealed the breach.The tricky part was getting the antenna out of the way.I pulled it out as fast as I could, wincing as the sudden pressure drop dizzied me and made the wound in my side scream in agony.I got the breach kit over the hole and sealed it.It held.The suit backfilled the missing air with yet more oxygen.Checking my arm readouts, I saw the suit was now at 85 percent oxygen.For reference, Earths atmosphere is about 21 percent.Id be okay, so long as I didnt spend too much time like that.I stumbled up the hill back toward the Hab.As I crested the rise, I saw something that made me very happy and something that made me very sad: The Hab was intact (yay!)and the MAV was gone (boo!).Right that moment I knew I was screwed.But I didnt want to just die out on the surface.I limped back to the Hab and fumbled my way into an airlock.As soon as it equalized, I threw off my helmet.Once inside the Hab, I doffed the suit and got my first good look at the injury.It would need stitches.Fortunately, all of us had been trained in basic medical procedures, and the Hab had excellent medical supplies.A quick shot of local anesthetic, irrigate the wound, nine stitches, and I was done.Id be taking antibiotics for a couple of weeks, but other than that Id be fine.I knew it was hopeless, but I tried firing up the communications array.No signal, of course.The primary satellite dish had broken off, remember?And it took the reception antennae with it.The Hab had secondary and tertiary communications systems, but they were both just for talking to the MAV, which would use its much more powerful systems to relay to Hermes.Thing is, that only works if the MAV is still around.I had no way to talk to Hermes.In time, I could locate the dish out on the surface, but it would take weeks for me to rig up any repairs, and that would be too late.In an abort, Hermes would leave orbit within twenty four hours.The orbital dynamics made the trip safer and shorter the earlier you left, so why wait?Checking out my suit, I saw the antenna had plowed through my bio monitor computer.When on an EVA, all the crews suits are networked so we can see each others status.The rest of the crew would have seen the pressure in my suit drop to nearly zero, followed immediately by my bio signs going flat.Add to that watching me tumble down a hill with a spear through me in the middle of a sandstorm yeah.They thought I was dead.How could they not?They may have even had a brief discussion about recovering my body, but regulations are clear.In the event a crewman dies on Mars, he stays on Mars.Leaving his body behind reduces weight for the MAV on the trip back.That means more disposable fuel and a larger margin of error for the return thrust.No point in giving that up for sentimentality.So thats the situation.Im stranded on Mars.I have no way to communicate with Hermes or Earth.Everyone thinks Im dead.Im in a Hab designed to last thirty one days.If the oxygenator breaks down, Ill suffocate.If the water reclaimer breaks down, Ill die of thirst.If the Hab breaches, Ill just kind of explode.If none of those things happen, Ill eventually run out of food and starve to death.So yeah.Im fucked.Chapter 2      LOG ENTRY: SOL 7  Okay, Ive had a good nights sleep, and things dont seem as hopeless as they did yesterday.Today I took stock of supplies and did a quick EVA to check up on the external equipment.Heres my situation:  The surface mission was supposed to be thirty one days.For redundancy, the supply probes had enough food to last the whole crew fifty six days.That way if one or two probes had problems, wed still have enough food to complete the mission.We were six days in when all hell broke loose, so that leaves enough food to feed six people for fifty days.Im just one guy, so itll last me three hundred days.And thats if I dont ration it.So Ive got a fair bit of time.Im pretty flush on EVA suits, too.Each crew member had two space suits: a flight spacesuit to wear during descent and ascent, and the much bulkier and more robust EVA suit to wear when doing surface operations.My flight spacesuit has a hole in it, and of course the crew was wearing the other five when they returned to Hermes.But all six EVA suits are still here and in perfect condition.The Hab stood up to the storm without any problems.Outside, things arent so rosy.I cant find the satellite dish.It probably got blown kilometers away.The MAV is gone, of course.My crewmates took it up to Hermes.Though the bottom half (the landing stage) is still here.No reason to take that back up when weight is the enemy.It includes the landing gear, the fuel plant, and anything else NASA figured it wouldnt need for the trip back up to orbit.The MDV is on its side and theres a breach in the hull.Looks like the storm ripped the cowling off the reserve chute (which we didnt have to use on landing).Once the chute was exposed, it dragged the MDV all over the place, smashing it against every rock in the area.Not that the MDV would be much use to me.Its thrusters cant even lift its own weight.But it might have been valuable for parts.Might still be.Both rovers are half buried in sand, but theyre in good shape otherwise.Their pressure seals are intact.Makes sense.Operating procedure when a storm hits is to stop motion and wait for the storm to pass.Theyre made to stand up to punishment.Ill be able to dig them out with a day or so of work.Ive lost communication with the weather stations, placed a kilometer away from the Hab in four directions.They might be in perfect working order for all I know.The Habs communications are so weak right now it probably cant even reach a kilometer.The solar cell array was covered in sand, rendering it useless (hint: solar cells need sunlight to make electricity).But once I swept the cells off, they returned to full efficiency.Whatever I end up doing, Ill have plenty of power for it.Two hundred square meters of solar cells, with hydrogen fuel cells to store plenty of reserve.All I need to do is sweep them off every few days.Things indoors are great, thanks to the Habs sturdy design.I ran a full diagnostic on the oxygenator.Twice.Its perfect.If anything goes wrong with it, theres a short term spare I can use.But its solely for emergency use while repairing the main one.The spare doesnt actually pull CO2 apart and recapture the oxygen.It just absorbs the CO2 the same way the space suits do.Its intended to last five days before it saturates the filters, which means thirty days for me (just one person breathing, instead of six).So theres some insurance there.The water reclaimer is working fine, too.The bad news is theres no backup.If it stops working, Ill be drinking reserve water while I rig up a primitive distillery to boil piss.Also, Ill lose half a liter of water per day to breathing until the humidity in the Hab reaches its maximum and water starts condensing on every surface.Then Ill be licking the walls.Yay.Anyway, for now, no problems with the water reclaimer.So yeah.Food, water, shelter all taken care of.Im going to start rationing food right now.Meals are pretty minimal already, but I think I can eat a three fourths portion per meal and still be all right.That should turn my three hundred days of food into four hundred.Foraging around the medical area, I found the main bottle of vitamins.Theres enough multivitamins there to last years.So I wont have any nutritional problems (though Ill still starve to death when Im out of food, no matter how many vitamins I take).The medical area has morphine for emergencies.And theres enough there for a lethal dose.Im not going to slowly starve to death, Ill tell you that.If I get to that point, Ill take an easier way out.Everyone on the mission had two specialties.Im a botanist and mechanical engineer; basically, the missions fix it man who played with plants.The mechanical engineering might save my life if something breaks.Ive been thinking about how to survive this.Its not completely hopeless.Therell be humans back on Mars in about four years when Ares 4 arrives (assuming they didnt cancel the program in the wake of my death).Ares 4 will be landing at the Schiaparelli crater, which is about 3200 kilometers away from my location here in Acidalia Planitia.No way for me to get there on my own.But if I could communicate, I might be able to get a rescue.Not sure how theyd manage that with the resources on hand, but NASA has a lot of smart people.So thats my mission now.Find a way to communicate with Earth.If I cant manage that, find a way to communicate with Hermes when it returns in four years with the Ares 4 crew.Of course, I dont have any plan for surviving four years on one year of food.But one thing at a time here.For now, Im well fed and have a purpose: Fix the damn radio.LOG ENTRY: SOL 10  Well, Ive done three EVAs and havent found any hint of the communications dish.I dug out one of the rovers and had a good drive around, but after days of wandering, I think its time to give up.The storm probably blew the dish far away and then erased any drag marks or scuffs that might have led to a trail.Probably buried it, too.I spent most of today out at whats left of the communications array.Its really a sorry sight.I may as well yell toward Earth for all the good that damned thing will do me.I could throw together a rudimentary dish out of metal I find around the base, but this isnt some walkie talkie Im working with here.Communicating from Mars to Earth is a pretty big deal, and requires extremely specialized equipment.I wont be able to whip something up with tinfoil and gum.I need to ration my EVAs as well as food.The CO2 filters are not cleanable.Once theyre saturated, theyre done.The mission accounted for a four hour EVA per crew member per day.Fortunately, CO2 filters are light and small, so NASA had the luxury of sending more than we needed.All told, I have about 1500 hours worth of CO2 filters.After that, any EVAs I do will have to be managed with bloodletting the air.Fifteen hundred hours may sound like a lot, but Im faced with spending at least four years here if Im going to have any hope of rescue, with a minimum of several hours per week dedicated to sweeping off the solar array.Anyway.No needless EVAs.In other news, Im starting to come up with an idea for food.My botany background may come in useful after all.Why bring a botanist to Mars?After all, its famous for not having anything growing there.Well, the idea was to figure out how well things grow in Martian gravity, and see what, if anything, we can do with Martian soil.The short answer is: quite a lot almost.Martian soil has the basic building blocks needed for plant growth, but theres a lot of stuff going on in Earth soil that Mars soil doesnt have, even when its placed in an Earth atmosphere and given plenty of water.Bacterial activity, certain nutrients provided by animal life, etc.None of that is happening on Mars.One of my tasks for the mission was to see how plants grow here, in various combinations of Earth and Mars soil and atmosphere.Thats why I have a small amount of Earth soil and a bunch of plant seeds with me.I cant get too excited, however.Its about the amount of soil youd put in a window box, and the only seeds I have are a few species of grass and ferns.Theyre the most rugged and easily grown plants on Earth, so NASA picked them as the test subjects.So I have two problems: not enough dirt, and nothing edible to plant in it.But Im a botanist, damn it.I should be able to find a way to make this happen.If I dont, Ill be a really hungry botanist in about a year.LOG ENTRY: SOL 11  I wonder how the Cubs are doing.LOG ENTRY: SOL 14  I got my undergrad degree at the University of Chicago.Half the people who studied botany were hippies who thought they could return to some natural world system.Somehow feeding seven billion people through pure gathering.They spent most of their time working out better ways to grow pot.I didnt like them.Ive always been in it for the science, not for any New World Order bullshit.When they made compost heaps and tried to conserve every little ounce of living matter, I laughed at them.Look at the silly hippies!Look at their pathetic attempts to simulate a complex global ecosystem in their backyard.Of course, now Im doing exactly that.Im saving every scrap of biomatter I can find.Every time I finish a meal, the leftovers go to the compost bucket.As for other biological material  The Hab has sophisticated toilets.Shit is usually vaccum dried, then accumulated in sealed bags to be discarded on the surface.Not anymore!In fact, I even did an EVA to recover the previous bags of shit from before the crew left.Being completely desiccated, this particular shit didnt have bacteria in it anymore, but it still had complex proteins and would serve as useful manure.Adding it to water and active bacteria would quickly get it inundated, replacing any population killed by the Toilet of Doom.I found a big container and put a bit of water in it, then added the dried shit.Since then, Ive added my own shit to it as well.The worse it smells, the better things are going.Thats the bacteria at work!Once I get some Martian soil in here, I can mix in the shit and spread it out.Then I can sprinkle the Earth soil on top.You might not think that would be an important step, but it is.There are dozens of species of bacteria living in Earth soil, and theyre critical to plant growth.Theyll spread out and breed like well, like a bacterial infection.People have been using human waste as fertilizer for centuries.Its even got a pleasant name: night soil.Normally, its not an ideal way to grow crops, because it spreads disease: Human waste has pathogens in it that, you guessed it, infect humans.But its not a problem for me.The only pathogens in this waste are the ones I already have.Within a week, the Martian soil will be ready for plants to germinate in.But I wont plant yet.Ill bring in more lifeless soil from outside and spread some of the live soil over it.Itll infect the new soil and Ill have double what I started with.After another week, Ill double it again.And so on.Of course, all the while, Ill be adding all new manure to the effort.My asshole is doing as much to keep me alive as my brain.This isnt a new concept I just came up with.People have speculated on how to make crop soil out of Martian dirt for decades.Ill just be putting it to the test for the first time.I searched through the food supplies and found all sorts of things that I can plant.Peas, for instance.Plenty of beans, too.I also found several potatoes.If any of them can still germinate after their ordeal, thatll be great.With a nearly infinite supply of vitamins, all I need are calories of any kind to survive.The total floor space of the Hab is about 92 square meters.I plan to dedicate all of it to this endeavor.I dont mind walking on dirt.Itll be a lot of work, but Im going to need to cover the entire floor to a depth of 10 centimeters.That means Ill have to transport 9.2 cubic meters of Martian soil into the Hab.I can get maybe one tenth of a cubic meter in through the airlock at a time, and itll be backbreaking work to collect it.But in the end, if everything goes to plan, Ill have 92 square meters of crop able soil.Hell yeah Im a botanist!Fear my botany powers!LOG ENTRY: SOL 15  Ugh!This is backbreaking work!I spent twelve hours today on EVAs to bring dirt into the Hab.I only managed to cover a small corner of the base, maybe five square meters.At this rate itll take me weeks to get all the soil in.But hey, time is one thing Ive got.The first few EVAs were pretty inefficient; me filling small containers and bringing them in through the airlock.Then I got wise and just put one big container in the airlock itself and filled that with small containers till it was full.That sped things up a lot because the airlock takes about ten minutes to get through.I ache all over.And the shovels I have are made for taking samples, not heavy digging.My back is killing me.I foraged in the medical supplies and found some Vicodin.I took it about ten minutes ago.Should be kicking in soon.Anyway, its nice to see progress.Time to start getting the bacteria to work on these minerals.After lunch.No three fourths ration today.Ive earned a full meal.LOG ENTRY: SOL 16  One complication I hadnt thought of: water.Turns out being on the surface of Mars for a few million years eliminates all the water in the soil.My masters degree in botany makes me pretty sure plants need wet dirt to grow in.Not to mention the bacteria that has to live in the dirt first.Fortunately, I have water.But not as much as I want.To be viable, soil needs 40 liters of water per cubic meter.My overall plan calls for 9.2 cubic meters of soil.So Ill eventually need 368 liters of water to feed it.The Hab has an excellent water reclaimer.Best technology available on Earth.So NASA figured, Why send a lot of water up there?Just send enough for an emergency.Humans need three liters of water per day to be comfortable.They gave us 50 liters each, making 300 liters total in the Hab.Im willing to dedicate all but an emergency 50 liters to the cause.That means I can feed 62.5 square meters at a depth of 10 centimeters.About two thirds of the Habs floor.Itll have to do.Thats the long term plan.For today, my goal was five square meters.I wadded up blankets and uniforms from my departed crewmates to serve as one edge of a planter box with the curved walls of the Hab being the rest of the perimeter.It was as close to five square meters as I could manage.I filled it with sand to a depth of 10 centimeters.Then I sacrificed 20 liters of precious water to the dirt gods.Then things got disgusting.I dumped my big container o shit onto the soil and nearly puked from the smell.I mixed this soil and shit together with a shovel, and spread it out evenly again.Then I sprinkled the Earth soil on top.Get to work, bacteria.Im counting on you.That smells going to stick around for a while, too.Its not like I can open a window.Still, you get used to it.In other news, today is Thanksgiving.My family will be gathering in Chicago for the usual feast at my parents house.My guess is it wont be much fun, what with me having died ten days ago.Hell, they probably just got done with my funeral.I wonder if theyll ever find out what really happened.Ive been so busy staying alive I never thought of what this must be like for my parents.Right now, theyre suffering the worst pain anyone can endure.Id give anything just to let them know Im still alive.Ill just have to survive to make up for it.LOG ENTRY: SOL 22  Wow.Things really came along.I got all the sand in and ready to go.Two thirds of the base is now dirt.And today I executed my first dirt doubling.Its been a week, and the former Martian soil is rich and lovely.Two more doublings and Ill have covered the whole field.All that work was great for my morale.It gave me something to do.But after things settled down a bit, and I had dinner while listening to Johanssens Beatles music collection, I got depressed again.Doing the math, this wont keep me from starving.My best bet for making calories is potatoes.They grow prolifically and have a reasonable caloric content (770 calories per kilogram).Im pretty sure the ones I have will germinate.Problem is I cant grow enough of them.In 62 square meters, I could grow maybe 150 kilograms of potatoes in 400 days (the time I have before running out of food).Thats a grand total of 115,500 calories, a sustainable average of 288 calories per day.With my height and weight, if Im willing to starve a little, I need 1500 calories per day.Not even close.So I cant just live off the land forever.But I can extend my life.The potatoes will last me 76 days.Potatoes grow continually, so in those 76 days, I can grow another 22,000 calories of potatoes, which will tide me over for another 15 days.After that, its kind of pointless to continue the trend.All told it buys me about 90 days.So now Ill start starving to death on Sol 490 instead of Sol 400.Its progress, but any hope of survival rests on me surviving until Sol 1412, when Ares 4 will land.Theres about a thousand days of food I dont have.And I dont have a plan for how to get it.Shit.Chapter 3      LOG ENTRY: SOL 25  Remember those old math questions you had in algebra class?Where water is entering a container at a certain rate and leaving at a different rate and you need to figure out when itll be empty?Well, that concept is critical to the Mark Watney doesnt die project Im working on.I need to create calories.And I need enough to last the 1387 sols until Ares 4 arrives.If I dont get rescued by Ares 4, Im dead anyway.A sol is 39 minutes longer than a day, so it works out to be 1425 days.Thats my target: 1425 days of food.I have plenty of multivitamins; over double what I need.And theres five times the minimum protein in each food pack, so careful rationing of portions takes care of my protein needs for at least four years.My general nutrition is taken care of.I just need calories.I need 1500 calories every day.I have 400 days of food to start off with.So how many calories do I need to generate per day along the entire time period to stay alive for around 1425 days?Ill spare you the math.The answer is about 1100.I need to create 1100 calories per day with my farming efforts to survive until Ares 4 gets here.Actually, a little more than that, because its Sol 25 right now and I havent actually planted anything yet.With my 62 square meters of farmland, Ill be able to create about 288 calories per day.So I need almost four times my current plans production to survive.That means I need more surface area for farming, and more water to hydrate the soil.So lets take the problems one at a time.How much farmland can I really make?There are 92 square meters in the Hab.Lets say I could make use of all of it.Also, there are five unused bunks.Lets say I put soil in on them, too.Theyre 2 square meters each, giving me 10 more square meters.So were up to 102.The Hab has three lab tables, each about 2 square meters.I want to keep one for my own use, leaving two for the cause.Thats another 4 square meters, bringing the total to 106.I have two Martian rovers.They have pressure seals, allowing the occupants to drive without space suits during long periods traversing the surface.Theyre too cramped to plant crops in, and I want to be able to drive them around anyway.But both rovers have an emergency pop tent.There are a lot of problems with using pop tents as farmland, but they have 10 square meters of floor space each.Presuming I can overcome the problems, they net me another 20 square meters, bringing my farmland up to 126.One hundred and twenty six square meters of farmable land.Thats something to work with.I still dont have the water to moisten all that soil, but like I said, one thing at a time.The next thing to consider is how efficient I can be in growing potatoes.I based my crop yield estimates on the potato industry back on Earth.But potato farmers arent in a desperate race for survival like I am.Can I get a better yield?For starters, I can give attention to each individual plant.I can trim them and keep them healthy and not interfering with each other.Also, as their flowering bodies breach the surface, I can replant them deeper, then plant younger plants above them.For normal potato farmers, its not worth doing because theyre working with literally millions of potato plants.Also, this sort of farming annihilates the soil.Any farmer doing it would turn their land into a dust bowl within twelve years.Its not sustainable.But who cares?I just need to survive for four years.I estimate I can get 50 percent higher yield by using these tactics.And with the 126 square meters of farmland (just over double the 62 square meters I now have) it works out to be over 850 calories per day.Thats real progress.Id still be in danger of starvation, but it gets me in the range of survival.I might be able to make it by nearly starving but not quite dying.I could reduce my caloric use by minimizing manual labor.I could set the temperature of the Hab higher than normal, meaning my body would expend less energy keeping its temperature.I could cut off an arm and eat it, gaining me valuable calories and reducing my overall caloric need.No, not really.So lets say I could clear up that much farmland.Seems reasonable.Where do I get the water?To go from 62 to 126 square meters of farmland at 10 centimeters deep, Ill need 6.4 more cubic meters of soil (more shoveling, whee!)and thatll need over 250 liters of water.The 50 liters I have is for me to drink if the water reclaimer breaks.So Im 250 liters short of my 250 liter goal.Bleh.Im going to bed.LOG ENTRY: SOL 26  It was a backbreaking yet productive day.I was sick of thinking, so instead of trying to figure out where Ill get 250 liters of water, I did some manual labor.I need to get a whole assload more soil into the Hab, even if it is dry and useless right now.I got a cubic meter in before getting exhausted.Then, a minor dust storm dropped by for an hour and covered the solar collectors with crap.So I had to suit up again and do another EVA.I was in a pissy mood the whole time.Sweeping off a huge field of solar cells is boring and physically demanding.But once the job was done, I came back to my Little Hab on the Prairie.It was about time for another dirt doubling, so I figured I might as well get it over with.It took an hour.One more doubling and the usable soil will all be good to go.Also, I figured it was time to start up a seed crop.Id doubled the soil enough that I could afford to leave a little corner of it alone.I had twelve potatoes to work with.I am one lucky son of a bitch they arent freeze dried or mulched.Why did NASA send twelve whole potatoes, refrigerated but not frozen?And why send them along with us as in pressure cargo rather than in a crate with the rest of the Hab supplies?Because Thanksgiving was going to happen while we were doing surface operations, and NASAs shrinks thought it would be good for us to make a meal together.Not just to eat it, but to actually prepare it.Theres probably some logic to that, but who cares?I cut each potato into four pieces, making sure each piece had at least two eyes.The eyes are where they sprout from.I let them sit for a few hours to harden a bit, then planted them, well spaced apart, in the corner.Godspeed, little taters.My life depends on you.Normally, it takes at least 90 days to yield full sized potatoes.But I cant wait that long.Ill need to cut up all the potatoes from this crop to seed the rest of the field.By setting the Hab temperature to a balmy 25.5C, I can make the plants grow faster.Also, the internal lights will provide plenty of sunlight, and Ill make sure they get lots of water (once I figure out where to get water).There will be no foul weather, or any parasites to hassle them, or any weeds to compete with for soil or nutrients.With all this going for them, they should yield healthy, sproutable tubers within forty days.I figured that was enough being Farmer Mark for one day.A full meal for dinner.Id earned it.Plus, Id burned a ton of calories, and I wanted them back.I rifled through Commander Lewiss stuff until I found her personal data stick.Everyone got to bring whatever digital entertainment they wanted, and I was tired of listening to Johanssens Beatles albums for now.Time to see what Lewis had.Crappy TV shows.Thats what she had.Countless entire runs of TV shows from forever ago.Well.Beggars cant be choosers.Threes Company it is.LOG ENTRY: SOL 29  Over the last few days, I got in all the dirt that Ill need.I prepped the tables and bunks for holding the weight of soil, and even put the dirt in place.Theres still no water to make it viable, but I have some ideas.Really bad ideas, but theyre ideas.Todays big accomplishment was setting up the pop tents.The problem with the rovers pop tents is they werent designed for frequent use.The idea was youd throw out a pop tent, get in, and wait for rescue.The airlock is nothing more than valves and two doors.Equalize the airlock with your side of it, get in, equalize with the other side, get out.This means you lose a lot of air with each use.And Ill need to get in there at least once a day.The total volume of each pop tent is pretty low, so I cant afford to lose air from it.I spent hours trying to figure out how to attach a pop tent airlock to a Hab airlock.I have three airlocks in the Hab.Id be willing to dedicate two to pop tents.That would have been awesome.The frustrating part is pop tent airlocks can attach to other airlocks!You might have injured people in there, or not enough space suits.You need to be able to get people out without exposing them to the Martian atmosphere.But the pop tents were designed for your crewmates to come rescue you in a rover.The airlocks on the Hab are much larger and completely different from the airlocks on the rovers.When you think about it, theres really no reason to attach a pop tent to the Hab.Unless youre stranded on Mars, everyone thinks youre dead, and youre in a desperate fight against time and the elements to stay alive.But, you know, other than that edge case, theres no reason.So I finally decided Id just take the hit.Ill be losing some air every time I enter or exit a pop tent.The good news is each pop tent has an air feed valve on the outside.Remember, these are emergency shelters.The occupants might need air, and you can provide it from a rover by hooking up an air line.Its nothing more than a tube that equalizes the rovers air with the pop tents.The Hab and the rovers use the same valve and tubing standards, so I was able to attach the pop tents directly to the Hab.Thatll automatically replenish the air I lose with my entries and exits (what we NASA folk call ingress and egress).NASA was not screwing around with these emergency tents.The moment I pushed the panic button in the rover, there was an ear popping whoosh as the pop tent fired out, attached to the rover airlock.It took about two seconds.I closed the airlock from the rover side and ended up with a nice, isolated pop tent.Setting up the equalizer hose was trivial (for once Im using equipment the way it was designed to be used).Then, after a few trips through the airlock (with the air loss automatically equalized by the Hab) I got the dirt in.I repeated the process for the other tent.Everything went really easily.Sigh water.In high school, I played a lot of Dungeons and Dragons.(You may not have guessed this botanist/mechanical engineer was a bit of a nerd in high school, but indeed I was. )In the game I played a cleric.One of the magic spells I could cast was Create Water.I always thought it was a really stupid spell, and I never used it.Boy, what I wouldnt give to be able to do that in real life right now.Anyway.Thats a problem for tomorrow.For tonight, I have to get back to Threes Company.I stopped last night in the middle of the episode where Mr.Roper saw something and took it out of context.LOG ENTRY: SOL 30  I have an idiotically dangerous plan for getting the water I need.And boy, do I mean dangerous.But I dont have much choice.Im out of ideas and Im due for another dirt doubling in a few days.When I do the final doubling, Ill be doubling on to all that new soil Ive brought in.If I dont wet it first, itll just die.There isnt a lot of water here on Mars.Theres ice at the poles, but theyre too far away.If I want water, Ill have to make it from scratch.Fortunately, I know the recipe: Take hydrogen.Add oxygen.Burn.Lets take them one at a time.Ill start with oxygen.I have a fair bit of O2 reserves, but not enough to make 250 liters of water.Two high pressure tanks at one end of the Hab are my entire supply (plus the air in the Hab of course).They each contain 25 liters of liquid O2.The Hab would use them only in an emergency; it has the oxygenator to balance the atmosphere.The reason the O2 tanks are here is to feed the space suits and rovers.Anyway, the reserve oxygen would only be enough to make 100 liters of water (50 liters of O2 makes 100 liters of molecules that only have one O each).That would mean no EVAs for me, and no emergency reserves.And it would make less than half the water I need.Out of the question.But oxygens easier to find on Mars than you might think.The atmosphere is 95 percent CO2.And I happen to have a machine whose sole purpose is liberating oxygen from CO2.Yay, oxygenator!One problem: The atmosphere is very thinless than 1 percent of the pressure on Earth.So its hard to collect.Getting air from outside to inside is nearly impossible.The whole purpose of the Hab is to keep that sort of thing from happening.The tiny amount of Martian atmosphere that enters when I use an airlock is laughable.Thats where the MAV fuel plant comes in.My crewmates took away the MAV weeks ago.But the bottom half of it stayed behind.NASA isnt in the habit of putting unnecessary mass into orbit.The landing gear, ingress ramp, and fuel plant are still here.Remember how the MAV made its own fuel with help from the Martian atmosphere?Step one of that is to collect CO2 and store it in a high pressure vessel.Once I get the fuel plant hooked up to the Habs power, itll give me half a liter of liquid CO2 per hour, indefinitely.After ten sols itll have made 125 liters of CO2, which will make 125 liters of O2 after I feed it through the oxygenator.Thats enough to make 250 liters of water.So I have a plan for oxygen.The hydrogen will be a little trickier.I considered raiding the hydrogen fuel cells, but I need those batteries to maintain power at night.If I dont have that, itll get too cold.I could bundle up, but the cold would kill my crops.And each fuel cell has only a small amount of H2 anyway.Its just not worth sacrificing so much usefulness for so little gain.The one thing I have going for me is that energy is not a problem.I dont want to give that up.So Ill have to go a different route.I often talk about the MAV.But now I want to talk about the MDV.During the most terrifying twenty three minutes of my life, four of my crewmates and I tried not to shit ourselves while Martinez piloted the MDV down to the surface.It was kind of like being in a tumble dryer.First, we descended from Hermes, and decelerated our orbital velocity so we could start falling properly.Everything was smooth until we hit the atmosphere.If you think turbulence is rough in a jetliner going 720 kph, just imagine what its like at 28,000 kph.Several staged sets of chutes deployed automatically to slow our descent, then Martinez manually piloted us to the ground, using the thrusters to slow descent and control our lateral motion.Hed trained for this for years, and he did his job extraordinarily well.He exceeded all plausible expectations of landings, putting us just nine meters from the target.The guy just plain owned that landing.Thanks, Martinez!You may have saved my life!Not because of the perfect landing, but because he left so much fuel behind.Hundreds of liters of unused hydrazine.Each molecule of hydrazine has four hydrogen atoms in it.So each liter of hydrazine has enough hydrogen for two liters of water.I did a little EVA today to check.The MDV has 292 liters of juice left in the tanks.Enough to make almost 600 liters of water!Way more than I need!Theres just one catch: Liberating hydrogen from hydrazine is well its how rockets work.Its really, really hot.And dangerous.If I do it in an oxygen atmosphere, the hot and newly liberated hydrogen will explode.Therell be a lot of H2O at the end, but Ill be too dead to appreciate it.At its root, hydrazine is pretty simple.The Germans used it as far back as World War II for rocket assisted fighter fuel (and occasionally blew themselves up with it).All you have to do is run it over a catalyst (which I can extract from the MDV engine) and it will turn into nitrogen and hydrogen.Ill spare you the chemistry, but the end result is that five molecules of hydrazine becomes five molecules of harmless N2 and ten molecules of lovely H2.During this process, it goes through an intermediate step of being ammonia.Chemistry, being the sloppy bitch it is, ensures therell be some ammonia that doesnt react with the hydrazine, so itll just stay ammonia.You like the smell of ammonia?Well, itll be prevalent in my increasingly hellish existence.The chemistry is on my side.The question now is how do I actually make this reaction happen slowly, and how do I collect the hydrogen?The answer is: I dont know.I suppose Ill think of something.Or die.Anyway, much more important: I simply cant abide the replacement of Chrissy with Cindy.Threes Company may never be the same after this fiasco.Time will tell.Chapter 4      LOG ENTRY: SOL 32  So I ran into a bunch of problems with my water plan.My idea is to make 600 liters of water (limited by the hydrogen I can get from the hydrazine).That means Ill need 300 liters of liquid O2.I can create the O2 easily enough.It takes twenty hours for the MAV fuel plant to fill its 10 liter tank with CO2.The oxygenator can turn it into O2, then the atmospheric regulator will see the O2 content in the Hab is high, and pull it out of the air, storing it in the main O2 tanks.Theyll fill up, so Ill have to transfer O2 over to the rovers tanks and even the space suit tanks as necessary.But I cant create it very quickly.At half a liter of CO2 per hour, it will take twenty five days to make the oxygen I need.Thats longer than Id like.Also, theres the problem of storing the hydrogen.The air tanks of the Hab, the rovers, and all the space suits add up to exactly 374 liters of storage.To hold all the materials for water, I would need a whopping 900 liters of storage.I considered using one of the rovers as a tank.It would certainly be big enough, but it just isnt designed to hold in that much pressure.Its made to hold (you guessed it) one atmosphere.I need vessels that can hold fifty times that much.Im sure a rover would burst.The best way to store the ingredients of water is to make them be water.So whats what Ill have to do.The concept is simple, but the execution will be incredibly dangerous.Every twenty hours, Ill have 10 liters of CO2 thanks to the MAV fuel plant.Ill vent it into the Hab via the highly scientific method of detaching the tank from the MAV landing struts, bringing it into the Hab, then opening the valve until its empty.The oxygenator will turn it into oxygen in its own time.Then, Ill release hydrazine, very slowly, over the iridium catalyst, to turn it into N2 and H2.Ill direct the hydrogen to a small area and burn it.As you can see, this plan provides many opportunities for me to die in a fiery explosion.Firstly, hydrazine is some serious death.If I make any mistakes, therell be nothing left but the Mark Watney Memorial Crater where the Hab once stood.Presuming I dont fuck up with the hydrazine, theres still the matter of burning hydrogen.Im going to be setting a fire.In the Hab.On purpose.If you asked every engineer at NASA what the worst scenario for the Hab was, theyd all answer fire.If you asked them what the result would be, theyd answer death by fire.But if I can pull it off, Ill be making water continuously, with no need to store hydrogen or oxygen.Itll be mixed into the atmosphere as humidity, but the water reclaimer will pull it out.I dont even have to perfectly match the hydrazine end of it with the fuel plant CO2 part.Theres plenty of oxygen in the Hab, and plenty more in reserve.I just need to make sure not to make so much water I run myself out of O2.I hooked up the MAV fuel plant to the Habs power supply.Fortunately they both use the same voltage.Its chugging away, collecting CO2 for me.Half ration for dinner.All I accomplished today was thinking up a plan thatll kill me, and that doesnt take much energy.Im going to finish off the last of Threes Company tonight.Frankly, I like Mr.Furley more than the Ropers.LOG ENTRY: SOL 33  This may be my last entry.Ive known since Sol 6 there was a good chance Id die here.But I figured it would be when I ran out of food.I didnt think it would be this early.Im about to fire up the hydrazine.Our mission was designed knowing that anything might need maintenance, so I have plenty of tools.Even in a space suit, I was able to pry the access panels off the MDV and get at the six hydrazine tanks.I set them in the shadow of a rover to keep them from heating up too much.Theres more shade and a cooler temperature near the Hab, but fuck that.If theyre going to blow up, they can blow up a rover, not my house.Then I pried out the reaction chamber.It took some work and I cracked the damn thing in half, but I got it out.Lucky for me I dont need a proper fuel reaction.In fact, I really, super duper dont want a proper fuel reaction.I brought the reaction chamber in.I briefly considered only bringing one tank of hydrazine in at a time to reduce risk.But some back of the napkin math told me even one tank was enough to blow the whole Hab up.So I brought them all in.Why not?The tanks have manual vent valves.Im not 100 percent sure what theyre for.Certainly we were never expected to use them.I think theyre there to release pressure during the many quality checks done during construction and before fueling.Whatever the reason, I have valves to work with.All it takes is a wrench.I liberated a spare water hose from the water reclaimer.With some thread torn out of a uniform (sorry, Johanssen), I attached it to the valve output.Hydrazine is a liquid, so all I have to do is lead it to the reaction chamber (more of a reaction bowl now).Meanwhile, the MAV fuel plant is still working.Ive already brought in one tank of CO2, vented it, and returned it for refilling.So there are no more excuses.Its time to start making water.If you find the charred remains of the Hab, it means I did something wrong.Im copying this log over to both rovers, so its more likely itll survive.Here goes nothin.LOG ENTRY: SOL 33 (2)  Well, I didnt die.First thing I did was put on the inner lining of my EVA suit.Not the bulky suit itself, just the inner clothing I wear under it, including the gloves and booties.Then I got an oxygen mask from the medical supplies and some lab goggles from Vogels chem kit.Almost all of my body was protected and I was breathing canned air.Why?Because hydrazine is very toxic.If I breathe too much of it, Ill get major lung problems.If I get it on my skin, Ill have chemical burns for the rest of my life.I wasnt taking any chances.I turned the valve until a trickle of hydrazine came out.I let one drop fall into the iridium bowl.It undramatically sizzled and disappeared.But hey, thats what I wanted.I just freed up hydrogen and nitrogen.Yay!One thing I have in abundance here are bags.Theyre not much different from kitchen trash bags, though Im sure they cost $50,000 because of NASA.In addition to being our commander, Lewis was also the geologist.She was going to collect rock and soil samples from all over the operational area (10 kilometer radius).Weight limits restricted how much she could actually bring back to Earth, so she was going to collect first, then sort out the most interesting 50 kilograms to take home.The bags were to store and tag the samples.Some are smaller than a Ziploc, while others are as big as a Hefty lawn and leaf bag.Also, I have duct tape.Ordinary duct tape, like you buy at a hardware store.Turns out even NASA cant improve on duct tape.I cut up a few Hefty sized bags and taped them together to make a sort of tent.Really it was more of a supersized bag.I was able to cover the whole table where my hydrazine mad scientist setup was.I put a few knickknacks on the table to keep the plastic out of the iridium bowl.Thankfully, the bags are clear, so I can still see whats going on.Next, I sacrificed a space suit to the cause.I needed an air hose.I have a surplus of space suits, after all.A total of six; one for each crew member.So I dont mind murdering one of them.I cut a hole in the top of the plastic and duct taped the hose in place.Nice seal, I think.With some more string from Johannsens clothing, I hung the other end of the hose from the top of the Habs dome by two angled threads (to keep them well clear of the hose opening).Now I had a little chimney.The hose was about one centimeter wide.Hopefully a good aperture.The hydrogen will be hot after the reaction, and itll want to go up.So Ill let it go up the chimney, then burn it as it comes out.Then I had to invent fire.NASA put a lot of effort into making sure nothing here can burn.Everything is made of metal or flame retardant plastic and the uniforms are synthetic.I needed something that could hold a flame, some kind of pilot light.I dont have the skills to keep enough H2 flowing to feed a flame without killing myself.Too narrow a margin there.After a search of everyones personal items (hey, if they wanted privacy, they shouldnt have abandoned me on Mars with their stuff) I found my answer.Martinez is a devout Catholic.I knew that.What I didnt know was he brought along a small wooden cross.Im sure NASA gave him shit about it, but I also know Martinez is one stubborn son of a bitch.I chipped his sacred religious item into long splinters using a pair of pliers and a screwdriver.I figure if theres a God, He wont mind, considering the situation Im in.If ruining the only religious icon I have leaves me vulnerable to Martian vampires, Ill have to risk it.There were plenty of wires and batteries around to make a spark.But you cant just ignite wood with a small electric spark.So I collected ribbons of bark from local palm trees, then got a couple of sticks and rubbed them together to create enough friction to  No not really.I vented pure oxygen at the stick and gave it a spark.It lit up like a match.With my mini torch in hand, I started a slow hydrazine flow.It sizzled on the iridium and disappeared.Soon I had short bursts of flame sputtering from the chimney.The main thing I had to watch was the temperature.Hydrazine breaking down is extremely exothermic.So I did it a bit at a time, constantly watching the readout of a thermocouple Id attached to the iridium chamber.Point is, the process worked!Each hydrazine tank holds a little over 50 liters, which would be enough to make 100 liters of water.Im limited by my oxygen production, but Im all excited now, so Im willing to use half my reserves.Long story short, Ill stop when the tank is half empty, and Ill have 50 liters of water at the end!LOG ENTRY: SOL 34  Well, that took a really long time.Ive been at it all night with the hydrazine.But I got the job done.I could have finished faster, but I figured cautions best when setting fire to rocket fuel in an enclosed space.Boy is this place a tropical jungle now, Ill tell ya.Its almost 30C in here, and humid as all hell.I just dumped a ton of heat and 50 liters of water into the air.During this process, the poor Hab had to be the mother of a messy toddler.Its been replacing the oxygen Ive used, and the water reclaimer is trying to get the humidity down to sane levels.Nothing to be done about the heat.Theres actually no air conditioning in the Hab.Mars is cold.Getting rid of excess heat isnt something we expected to deal with.Ive now grown accustomed to hearing the alarms blare at all times.The fire alarm has finally stopped, now that theres no more fire.The low oxygen alarm should stop soon.The high humidity alarm will take a little longer.The water reclaimer has its work cut out for it today.For a moment, there was yet another alarm.The water reclaimers main tank was full.Booyah!Thats the kind of problem I want to have!Remember the space suit I vandalized yesterday?I hung it on its rack and carried buckets of water to it from the reclaimer.It can hold an atmosphere of air in.It should be able to handle a few buckets of water.Man Im tired.Been up all night, and its time to sleep.But Ill drift off to dreamland in the best mood Ive been in since Sol 6.Things are finally going my way.In fact, theyre going great!I have a chance to live after all!LOG ENTRY: SOL 37  I am fucked, and Im gonna die!Okay, calm down.Im sure I can get around this.Im writing this log to you, dear future Mars archaeologist, from Rover 2.You may wonder why Im not in the Hab right now.Because I fled in terror, thats why!And Im not sure what the hell to do next.I guess I should explain what happened.If this is my last entry, youll at least know why.Over the past few days, Ive been happily making water.Its been going swimmingly.(See what I did there?Swimmingly?)I even beefed up the MAV fuel plant compressor.It was very technical (I increased the voltage to the pump).So Im making water even faster now.After my initial burst of 50 liters, I decided to settle down and just make it at the rate I get O2.Im not willing to go below a 25 liter reserve.So when I dip too low, I stop dicking with hydrazine until I get the O2 back up to well above 25 liters.Important note: When I say I made 50 liters of water, thats an assumption.I didnt reclaim 50 liters of water.The additional soil Id filled the Hab with was extremely dry and greedily sucked up a lot of the humidity.Thats where I want the water to go anyway, so Im not worried, and I wasnt surprised when the reclaimer didnt get anywhere near 50 liters.I get 10 liters of CO2 every fifteen hours now that I souped up the pump.Ive done this process four times.My math tells me that, including my initial 50 liter burst, I should have added 130 liters of water to the system.Well my math was a damn liar!Id gained 70 liters in the water reclaimer and the space suit turned water tank.Theres plenty of condensation on the walls and domed roof, and the soil is certainly absorbing its fair share.But that doesnt account for 60 liters of missing water.Something was wrong.Thats when I noticed the other O2 tank.The Hab has two reserve O2 tanks.One on each side of the structure, for safety reasons.The Hab can decide which one to use whenever it wants.Turns out its been topping off the atmosphere from Tank 1.But when I add O2 to the system (via the oxygenator), the Hab evenly distributes the gain between the two tanks.Tank 2 has been slowly gaining oxygen.Thats not a problem.The Hab is just doing its job.But it does mean Ive been gaining O2 over time.Which means Im not consuming it as fast as I thought.At first, I thought Yay!More oxygen!Now I can make water faster!But then a more disturbing thought occurred to me.Follow my logic: Im gaining O2.But the amount Im bringing in from outside is constant.So the only way to gain it is to be using less than I thought.But Ive been doing the hydrazine reaction with the assumption that I was using all of it.The only possible explanation is that I havent been burning all the released hydrogen.Its obvious now, in retrospect.But it never occurred to me that some of the hydrogen just wouldnt burn.It got past the flame, and went on its merry way.Damn it, Jim, Im a botanist, not a chemist!Chemistry is messy, so theres unburned hydrogen in the air.All around me.Mixed in with the oxygen.Just hanging out.Waiting for a spark so it can blow the Hab up!Once I figured this out and composed myself, I got a Ziploc sized sample bag and waved it around a bit, then sealed it.Then, a quick EVA to a rover, where we keep the atmospheric analyzers.Nitrogen: 22 percent.Oxygen: 9 percent.Hydrogen: 64 percent.Ive been hiding here in the rover ever since.Its Hydrogenville in the Hab.Im very lucky it hasnt blown.Even a small static discharge would have led to my own private Hindenburg.So, Im here in Rover 2.I can stay for a day or two, tops, before the CO2 filters from the rover and my space suit fill up.I have that long to figure out how to deal with this.The Hab is now a bomb.Chapter 5      LOG ENTRY: SOL 38  Im still cowering in the rover, but Ive had time to think.And I know how to deal with the hydrogen.I thought about the atmospheric regulator.It pays attention to whats in the air and balances it.Thats how the excess O2 Ive been importing ends up in the tanks.Problem is, its just not built to pull hydrogen out of the air.The regulator uses freeze separation to sort out the gasses.When it decides theres too much oxygen, it starts collecting air in a tank and cooling it to 90 kelvin.That makes the oxygen turn to liquid, but leaves the nitrogen (condensation point: 77K) still gaseous.Then it stores the O2.But I cant get it to do that for hydrogen, because hydrogen needs to be below 21K to turn liquid.And the regulator just cant get temperatures that low.Dead end.Heres the solution:  Hydrogen is dangerous because it can blow up.But it can only blow up if theres oxygen around.Hydrogen without oxygen is harmless.And the regulator is all about pulling oxygen out of the air.There are four different safety interlocks that prevent the regulator from letting the Habs oxygen content get too low.But theyre designed to work against technical faults, not deliberate sabotage (bwa ha ha!).Long story short, I can trick the regulator into pulling all the oxygen out of the Hab.Then I can wear a space suit (so I can breathe) and do whatever I want without fear of blowing up.Ill use an O2 tank to spray short bursts of oxygen at the hydrogen, and make a spark with a couple of wires and a battery.Itll set the hydrogen on fire, but only until the small bit of oxygen is used up.Ill just do that over and over, in controlled bursts, until Ive burned off all the hydrogen.One tiny flaw with that plan: Itll kill my dirt.The dirt is only viable soil because of the bacteria growing in it.If I get rid of all the oxygen, the bacteria will die.I dont have 100 billion little space suits handy.Its half a solution anyway.Time to take a break from thinking.Commander Lewis was the last one to use this rover.She was scheduled to use it again on Sol 7, but she went home instead.Her personal travel kits still in the back.Rifling through it, I found a protein bar and a personal USB, probably full of music to listen to on the drive.Time to chow down and see what the good commander brought along for music.LOG ENTRY SOL 38 (2)  Disco.God damn it, Lewis.LOG ENTRY: SOL 39  I think Ive got it.Soil bacteria are used to winters.They get less active, and require less oxygen to survive.I can lower the Hab temperature to 1C, and theyll nearly hibernate.This sort of thing happens on Earth all the time.They can survive a couple of days this way.If youre wondering how bacteria on Earth survive longer periods of cold, the answer is they dont.Bacteria from further underground where it is warmer breed upward to replace the dead ones.Theyll still need some oxygen, but not much.I think a 1 percent content will do the trick.That leaves a little in the air for the bacteria to breathe, but not enough to maintain a fire.So the hydrogen wont blow up.But that leads to yet another problem.The potato plants wont like the plan.They dont mind the lack of oxygen, but the cold will kill them.So Ill have to pot them (bag them, actually) and move them to a rover.They havent even sprouted yet, so its not like they need light.It was surprisingly annoying to find a way to make the heat stay on when the rovers unoccupied.But I figured it out.After all, Ive got nothing but time in here.So thats the plan.First, bag the potato plants and bring them to the rover (make sure it keeps the damn heater on).Then drop the Hab temperature to 1C.Then reduce the O2 content to 1 percent.Then burn off the hydrogen with a battery, some wires, and a tank of O2.Yeah.This all sounds like a great idea with no chance of catastrophic failure.That was sarcasm, by the way.Well, off I go.LOG ENTRY: SOL 40  Things werent 100 percent successful.They say no plan survives first contact with implementation.Id have to agree.Heres what happened:  I summoned up the courage to return to the Hab.Once I got there, I felt a little more confident.Everything was how Id left it.(What did I expect?Martians looting my stuff?)It would take a while to let the Hab cool, so I started that right away by turning the temperature down to 1C.I bagged the potato plants, and got a chance to check up on them while I was at it.Theyre rooting nicely and about to sprout.One thing I hadnt accounted for was how to bring them from the Hab to the rovers.The answer was pretty easy.I put all of them in Martinezs space suit.Then I dragged it out with me to the rover Id set up as a temporary nursery.Making sure to jimmy the heater to stay on, I headed back to the Hab.By the time I got back, it was already chilly.Down to 5C already.Shivering and watching my breath condense in front of me, I threw on extra layers of clothes.Fortunately Im not a very big man.Martinezs clothes fit over mine, and Vogels fit over Martinezs.These shitty clothes were designed to be worn in a temperature controlled environment.Even with three layers, I was still cold.I climbed into my bunk and under the covers for more warmth.Once the temperature got to 1C, I waited another hour, just to make sure the bacteria in the dirt got the memo that it was time to take it slow.The next problem I ran into was the regulator.Despite my swaggering confidence, I wasnt able to outwit it.It really does not want to pull too much O2 out of the air.The lowest I could get it to was 15 percent.After that, it flatly refused to go lower, and nothing I did mattered.I had all these plans about getting in and reprogramming it.But the safety protocols turned out to be in ROMs.I cant blame it.Its whole purpose is to prevent the atmosphere from becoming lethal.Nobody at NASA thought, Hey, lets allow a fatal lack of oxygen that will make everyone drop dead!So I had to use a more primitive plan.The regulator uses a different set of vents for air sampling than it does for main air separation.The air that gets freeze separated comes in through a single large vent on the main unit.But it samples the air from nine small vents that pipe back to the main unit.That way it gets a good average of the Hab, and one localized imbalance wont throw it off.I taped up eight of the intakes, leaving only one of them active.Then I taped the mouth of a Hefty sized bag over the neck hole of a spacesuit (Johanssens this time).In the back of the bag, I poked a small hole and taped it over the remaining intake.Then I inflated the bag with pure O2 from the suits tanks.Holy shit!the regulator thought, I better pull O2 out right away!Worked great!I decided not to wear a space suit after all.
