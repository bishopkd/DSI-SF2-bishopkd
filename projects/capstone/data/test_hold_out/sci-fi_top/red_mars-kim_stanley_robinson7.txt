And they would lead him to see an underground farm with an independent power plant, or a cache of tools and equipment, or a hidden garage full of rovers, or complete little mesa habitats, empty but ready for occupation.John would follow them bug eyed and slack jawed, asking questions and shaking his head in amazement.Yes, Arkady was showing him things; there was a whole movement down here, a little group in every town!Eventually he came to Senzeni Na.He was returning because Pauline had identified two workers there as absent without explanation from their jobs on the day the truck had fallen on him.The day after he arrived he interviewed them, but they proved to have plausible explanations for their absence from the net; they had been out climbing.But after he had apologized for taking their time, and started back to his room, three other mohole technicians introduced themselves as friends of Arkadys.John greeted them enthusiastically, glad that something would come of the trip; and in the end a group of eight took him in a rover to a canyon paralleling the moholes canyon.They drove down through the obscuring dust to a habitat dug into an overhanging canyon wall; it was invisible to satellites, its heat was released from a number of dispersed small vents which from space would look like Saxs old windmill heaters.We figure thats how Hirokos group has done it, one of his guides told him.Her name was Marian, and she had a long beak of a nose and eyes that were set too close together, so that her gaze was very intent.Do you know where Hiroko is?John asked.No, but we think theyre in the chaos.The universal response.He asked them about the cliff dwelling.It had been built, Marian told him, with equipment from Senzeni Na.It was currently uninhabited, but ready if needed.Needed for what?John said as he walked around the little dark rooms of the place.Marian stared at him.For the revolution, of course.The revolution!John had very little to say on the drive back.Marian and her companions sensed his shock, and it made them uneasy too.Perhaps they were concluding that Arkady had made a mistake in asking them to show John their habitat.There are a lot of these being prepared, Marian said defensively.Hiroko had given them the idea, and Arkady thought they might come in handy.She and her companions began ticking them off on their fingers: a whole stockpile of air  and ice mining equipment, buried in a dry ice tunnel at one of the south polar cap processing stations; a wellhole tapping the big aquifer under Kasei Vallis; scattered greenhouse labs around Acheron, growing pharmacologically useful plants; a communications center in the basement of Nadias concourse at Underhill.And thats just what we know about.There are one read samizdat appearing in the net that we had nothing to do with, and Arkadys certain that there are other groups out there, doing the same thing we are.Because when push comes to shove, were all going to need places to hide and fight from.Oh come on, John said.You all have to get it through your heads that this whole revolution scenario is nothing but a fantasia on the American Revolution, you know, the great frontier, the hardy pioneer colonists exploited by the imperial power, the revolt to go from colony to sovereign state its all just a false analogy!Why do you say that?Marian demanded.Whats different?Well for one thing, were not living on land that can sustain us.And for another, we dont have the means to revolt successfully!I disagree with both those points.You should talk to Arkady more about that.Ill try.Anyway I think theres a better way of doing it than all this sneaking around stealing equipment, something more direct.We simply tell UNOMA what the new Mars treaty is going to say.His companions shook their heads scornfully.We can talk all we want, Marian said, but thats not going to change what they do.Why not?Do you think they can just ignore the people who are living here?They may have continuous shuttles now, but were still eighty million kilometers away from them, and were here and theyre not.It may not be North America in the 1760s, but we do have some of the same advantages: were at a great distance, and were in possession.The important thing is not to fall into their way of thinking, into all the same old violent mistakes!And so he argued against revolution, nationalism, religion, economics against every mode of Terran thought that he could think of, all mashed together in his usual style.Revolution never even worked on Earth, not really.And here its all outmoded.We should be inventing a new program, just like Arkady says, including the ways to take control of our fate.With you all living a fantasy of the past youre leading us right into the repression youre complaining about!We need a new Martian way, a new Martian philosophy, economics, religion!They asked him just what these new Martian modes of thought might be, and he raised his hands.How can I say?When theyve never existed its hard to talk about them, hard to imagine them, because we dont have the images.Thats always the problem when you try to make something new, and believe me I know, because Ive been trying.But I think I can tell you what it will feel like it will feel like the first years here, when we were a group and we all worked together.When there was no purpose in life except to settle and discover this place, and we all decided together what we should do.Thats how it should feel.But those days are gone, Marian said, and the others nodded.Thats just your own fantasy of the past.Nothing but words.Its like youre holding a philosophy class in a giant gold mine, with armies bearing down on both sides.No no, John said.Im talking about methods for resistance, methods appropriate to our real situation, and not some revolutionary fantasy out of the history books!And around they went, again and again, until they were back at Senzeni Na, and had retired to the workers rooms on the lowest residential floor.There they argued passionately, through the timeslip and long into the night, and as they argued a certain elation filled John, because he could see them beginning to think about it it was clear that they were listening to him, and that what he said, and what he thought of them, mattered to them.This was the best return yet on the old First Man fishbowl; combined with Arkadys stamp of approval, it gave him an influence over them that was palpable.He could shake their confidence, he could make them think, he could force them to reevaluate, he could change their minds!And so in the murky purple Great Storm dawn they wandered down the halls to the kitchen and talked on, looking out the windows and bolting down coffee, glowing with a kind of inspiration, with the age old excitement of honest debate.And when they finally quit to go catch a little sleep before the day got going, even Marian was clearly shaken, and all of them were deep in thought, half convinced that John was right.John walked back to his guest suite feeling tired but happy.Whether Arkady had intended to or not, he had made John one of the leaders of his movement.Perhaps he would come to regret it, but there was no going back now.And John was sure it was for the best.He could be a sort of bridge between this underground and the rest of the people on Mars operating in both worlds, reconciling the two, forging them into a single force that would be more effective than either alone.A force with the mainstreams resources and the undergrounds enthusiasm, perhaps.Arkady considered that an impossible synthesis, but John had powers that Arkady didnt.So that he could, well, not usurp Arkadys leadership, but simply change them all.The door to his room in the guest quarters was open.He rushed in, alarmed, and there in the rooms two chairs sat Sam Houston and Michael Chang.So, Houston said.Where have you been?Oh come on, John said.His temper flared, his good mood burnt off in a flash.Did I pick the wrong door by mistake?He leaned back out to look.No, I didnt.These are my rooms.He lifted his arms and clicked on his wristpads recorder.What are you doing in here?We want to know where youve been, Houston said evenly.Weve got the authority to enter all the rooms here, and to get all our questions answered.So you might as well start.Come on, John scoffed.Dont you ever get tired of playing the bad cop?Dont you guys ever trade off?We just want answers to our questions, Chang said gently.Oh please, mister good cop, John said.We all want answers to our questions, dont we.Houston stood up already he was on the edge of losing his temper, and John walked right over to him and stopped with their chests about ten centimeters apart.Get out of my rooms, he said.Get out now, or Ill throw you out, and then well figure out who had the right to be in here.Houston merely stared at him, and without warning John shoved him hard in the chest.Houston ran into his chair and sat down involuntarily, bounced up going for John, but Chang jumped between them, saying, Wait a second, Sam, wait a second, while John shouted, Get out of my rooms!over and over at the top of his lungs, bumping against Changs back and glaring over his shoulder into Houstons red face.John nearly burst into laughter at the sight; his high spirits had returned with the success of the shove, and he stalked to the door bellowing Get out!Get out!Get out!so that Houston would not see the grin on his face.Chang pulled his angry colleague out into the hall and John followed.The three of them stood there, Chang carefully placing himself between his partner and John.He was bigger than either of them, and now he faced John with a worried, irritated look.Now what did you want?John said innocently.We want to know where youve been, Chang said doggedly.We have reason to suspect that your so called investigation of the sabotage incidents has been a very convenient cover for you.I suspect the same of you, John said.Chang ignored him.Things keep happening right after your visits, you see  They happen right during your visits.hoppers of dust were dropped in every mohole you visited during the Great Storm.Computer viruses attacked the software in Sax Russells office at Echus Overlook, right after your consultation with him in 2047.Biological viruses attacked the fast lichens at Acheron right after you left.And so on.John shrugged.So?Youve been here two months, and thats the best you can do?If were right, its good enough.Where were you last night?Sorry, John said.I dont answer questions from people who break into my rooms.You have to, Chang said.Its the law.What law?What are you going to do to me?He turned toward the open door of the room, and Chang moved to block him; he lost his temper again and jerked toward Chang, who flinched but remained in the doorway, immovable.John turned and walked away, back down to the commons.He left Senzeni Na that afternoon in a rover, and took the transponder road north along the eastern flank of Tharsis.It was a good road and three days later he was 1,300 kilometers to the north, just northwest of Noctis Labyrinthus, and when he came to a big transponder intersection, with a new fuel station, he hung a right and took the road east to Underhill.Each day as the rover rolled along blindly through the dust, he worked with Pauline.Pauline, would you please look up all planetary records for theft of dental equipment?She was as slow as a human in processing an incongruous request, but eventually the data were there.Then he had her go over the movement records of every suspect he could think of.When he was sure where everyone had been, he gave Helmut Bronski a call to protest the actions of Houston and Chang.They say theyre working with your authorization, Helmut, so I thought you should know what theyre doing.They are trying their best, Helmut said.I wish you would stop harassing them and cooperate, John.It could be helpful.I know you have nothing to hide, so why not be more helpful?Come on, Helmut, they dont ask for help.Its rank intimidation.Tell them to stop it.They are only trying to do their job, Helmut said blandly.I have not heard of anything illegitimate.John broke the connection.Later on he called Frank, who was in Burroughs.Whats with Helmut?Why is he turning the planet over to these policemen?You idiot, Frank said.He was typing madly at a computer screen as he talked, so that he seemed to be only barely conscious of what he was saying.Arent you paying any attention at all to whats going on here?I thought I was, John said.Were knee deep in gasoline!And these goddamned aging treatments are the match.But you never understood why we were sent here in the first place, so why should you understand anything now?He typed on, staring hard into his screen.John studied the little image of Frank on his wrist.Finally he said, Why were we sent here in the first place, Frank?Because Russia and our United States of America were desperate, thats why.Decrepit outmoded industrial dinosaurs, thats what we were, about to get eaten up by Japan and Europe and all the little tigers popping up in Asia.And we had all this space experience going to waste, and a couple of huge and unnecessary aerospace industries, and so we pooled them and came here on the chance that wed find something worthwhile, and it paid off!We struck gold, so to speak.Which is only more gasoline poured onto things, because gold rushes show whos powerful and whos not.And now even though we got a head start up here, there are a lot of new tigers down there who are better at things than we are, and they all want a piece of the action.Theres a lot of countries down there with no room and no resources, ten billion people standing in their own shit.I thought you told me Earth would always be falling apart.This isnt falling apart.Think about it if this damned treatment only goes to the rich, then the poor will revolt and itll all explode but if the treatment goes to everyone, then populations will soar and itll all explode.Either way its gone!Its going now!And naturally the transnats dont like that, its horrible for business when the world blows up.So theyre scared, and theyre deciding to try to hold things together by main force.Helmut and those policemen are only the smallest tip of the iceberg a lot of policymakers think a world police state for a few decades or so is our only chance of getting to some kind of population stabilization without a catastrophe.Control from above, the stupid bastards.Frank shook his head disgustedly, then leaned toward his screen and became absorbed in its contents.John said, Did you get the treatment, Frank?Of course I did.Leave me alone, John, Ive got work to do.The southern summer was warmer than the previous one that had been shrouded in the Great Storm, but still colder than any recorded.The storm was now almost two M years long, over three Terran years, but Sax was philosophical about it.John called him at Echus Overlook, and when John mentioned the cold nights he was experiencing Sax only said, Well very likely have low temperatures for the greater part of the terraforming period.But warmer per se isnt what were trying for.Venus is warm.What we want is survivable.If we can breathe the air, I dont care if its cold.Meanwhile it was cold, cold everywhere, the nights down to a hundred below every night, even on the equator.When John reached Underhill, a week after leaving Senzeni Na, he found there was a kind of pink ice covering the sidewalks; it was nearly invisible in the storms dim light, and walking around was a treacherous business.The people at Underhill spent most of their time indoors.John occupied a few weeks by helping the local bioengineering team field test a new fast snow algae.Underhill was crowded with strangers.Most of them were young Japanese or Europeans, who fortunately still used English to communicate with each other.John roomed in one of the old barrel vaults, near the northeast corner of the quadrant.The old quadrant was less popular than Nadias concourse, smaller and dimmer, and many of its vaults were now used for storage.It was strange to walk the square of hallways, remembering the pool, Mayas room, the dining hall now all dark, and stacked with boxes.Those years when the first hundred had been the only hundred.It was getting hard to remember what that had been like.He kept track through Pauline of the movements of quite a few people, the UNOMA investigating force among them.It was a not very rigorous surveillance, as it was not always easy to track the investigators, especially Houston and Chang and their crew, whom he suspected were going off net deliberately.Meanwhile the spaceports arrival records gave more evidence every month that Frank had been right about them being only the tip of the iceberg.A lot of people coming down at Burroughs in particular were working for UNOMA without job specifications, and then spreading out to the mines and moholes and other settlements, and going to work for the local security heads.And their Terran employment records were very interesting indeed.Often at the end of a session with Pauline John would leave the quadrant, and go for a walk outside, feeling disturbed and thinking hard.There was a lot more visibility than there had been; things were clearing up a bit out on the surface, though the pink ice still made walking tricky.It seemed the Great Storm was lessening.Wind speeds on the surface were only two or three times the prestorm average of thirty kilometers per hour, and the dust in the air was sometimes little more than a kind of thick haze, turning the sunsets into blazing pastel swirls of pink, yellow, orange, red, and purple, with random streaks of green or turquoise appearing and disappearing, along with icebows, and sun dogs, and occasional brilliant shafts of pure yellow light: nature at her most tasteless, transient and spectacular.And watching all that hazy color and movement John would be distracted from his thoughts, and climb the great white pyramid to have a look around, and then go back inside ready to start the fight again.One evening after one of these sunset extravaganzas he climbed down the peak of the great pyramid, and walked slowly back toward Underhill and then he spotted two figures climb out one of the garage side doors, and down a clear crawltube into a rover.There was something quick and furtive in their motion, and he stopped to look closer.They did not have their helmets on, and he recognized Houston and Chang by the backs of their heads and the size of their bodies.They moved with scurrying Terran inefficiency into the rover, and drove toward him.John polarized his faceplate and started walking again, head down, trying to look like someone coming in from work, veering to the side a bit to increase the distance between him and them.The rover plunged into a thick dust cloud and disappeared abruptly.By the time he got to the lock doors he was deep in thought, and almost frightened.He stood motionlessly at the door, thinking it over, and when he moved it was not to the door, but to the intercom console in the wall next to the door.There were several different kinds of jacks under the speakers, and carefully he unplugged the stopper in one and cleared away the fines crusting the edge these jacks were never used anymore and plugged in his wristpad.He tapped in the code for Pauline, and waited for encryption and decryption to work through.Yes, John?said Paulines voice from his helmet intercom speaker.Turn on your camera please, Pauline, and pan my room.Pauline was sitting on the side table by his bed, plugged into the wall.Her camera was a little fiber thing, rarely used, and the image on his wristpad was small, and the room was dim with only a nightlight on; and his face plates curve was yet another barrier, so that even with the wristpad right against it, he couldnt quite make out the images gray shapes, shifting.There was the bed, there was something on it, then the wall.Back ten degrees, John said, and squinted trying to comprehend the two centimeter square image.His bed.There was a man lying on his bed.Wasnt that what it was?The bottom of a shoe, torso, hair.It was hard to tell.It didnt move.Pauline, do you hear anything in the room?The vents, the electricity.Transmit to me what youre picking up on your mike, at full volume.He leaned his head to the left against his helmet, cramming his ear against the helmet speaker.A hiss, a whoosh, static.There was too much transmission error in a process like this, especially using these corroded old jacks.But certainly he heard no breathing.Pauline, can you enter the Underhill monitoring system, and locate our vaults door camera, and transmit its image to my wrist, please?He had directed the installation of Underhills security system just a few years before.Pauline still had all the plans and codes, and it didnt take long for her to replace the image on his wrist with that of the suite outside his room, seen from above.The suites lights were on, and in the cameras sweeps he could see that his door was shut; that was all.He let his wrist fall to his side and thought it over.Five minutes passed before he raised it again and began giving instructions through Pauline to the Underhill security system.Possession of the codes allowed him to instruct the entire camera system to erase its surveillance tapes, and then to run them in an hour loop rather than the usual eight hours.Then he instructed two of the cleaning robots to come to his room and open its door.While they did that he stood shivering, waiting for them to make their slow roll through the vaults.When they opened his door, he saw them through Paulines little eye; light poured into the room and momentarily blazed, then adjusted, and he had a much clearer view.Yes, it was a man on his bed.Johns breath went shallow.He teleoperated the robots, using the minute button toggles on his wristpad.It was a jerky procedure, but if lifting the man woke him up, so much the better.It didnt.The man lolled down on both sides of the robots cradling arms, which lifted him with their algorithmic delicacy.A body hanging down.The man was dead.John deliberately took a deep breath, then held it and continued the teleoperation, directing the first robot to deposit the body in the second robots big trash hopper.Sending the robots back down the hall to their storage vault was easy.Several people walked by them as they rolled along, but there was nothing he could do about that.The body was not visible except from above, and hopefully no one was paying enough attention to remember the robots later.When he got them in their storage room, he hesitated.Should he take the body to the incinerators in the Alchemists Quarter?But no now that it was out of his room, he didnt need to get rid of the body.In fact he would need it later.For the first time he wondered who it was.He directed the first robot to put its extensor eye against the bodys right wrist, and read with its magnetic imager.It took a long time for the eye to hit the right spot on the wrist.Then it held fast.The tiny tag that everyone had implanted on a wristbone held information in the standard dot language, and it only took a minute for Pauline to get an ID.Yashika Mui, UNOMA auditor, based at Underhill, arrived 2050.An actual person.A man who might have lived a thousand years.John began to shiver.He leaned against the glazed blue brick wall of Underhill.It would be an hour before he could go inside, or a little less.Impatiently he pushed off and walked around the quadrant.It took about fifteen minutes to walk around it usually, but now he found he was doing it in ten.After the second turn he walked over to the trailer park.Only two of the old trailers were still there, and they were apparently abandoned or used only for storage.Figures loomed out of the night dust between them, and for a second he was afraid, but they passed on by.He returned to the quadrant and circled it again, then walked out the path to the Alchemists Quarter.He stood looking at the antiquated complex of tubes and piping and squat white buildings, all covered with their black calligraphic equations.He thought of their first years.And now it had come to this, in what seemed the blink of an eye.In the gloom of the Great Storm.Civilization, corruption, crisis.Murder on Mars.He gritted his teeth.An hour had passed, it was nine p. m.  He went back to the lock and went inside, took off his helmet and walker and boots in the changing room, and stripped, went into the showers and showered, dried off and put on a jumper, combed his hair.He took a deep breath and walked around the south side of the quadrant and up through the vaults to the one with his room.As he was opening his door he was not surprised to see four of the UNOMA investigators appear, but he tried to act surprised when they ordered him to stop.Whats this?he said.It wasnt Houston or Chang, but rather three men, with one of the women from that first group at Low Point.The men clustered at his sides without really responding to him, and pulled his door completely open and two of them went inside.John controlled the urge to punch them, or shout at them, or laugh at the expressions that came over their faces when they saw that his room was empty; he merely stared curiously at them, and tried to limit himself to the irritation he would have shown had he been ignorant of what was going on.This irritation would have been considerable of course, and once he opened that door inside himself it was hard indeed to keep all his fury from banging through, hard to keep it to an innocents level; they had to be snapped at as if they were overzealous policemen, rather than assaulted as murderous functionaries.In their confusion at the unexpected situation he managed to drive them off with a few biting sentences, and when he had closed the door on them he stood in the middle of his room.Pauline, transmit whats happening on the security system to yourself, please, and record.Show me whatever cameras have those people.So Pauline tracked them.It only took a couple of minutes for them to go to the security control room, where they were joined by Chang and others.They went after the camera packs.John sat at Paulines screen and watched right along with them as they ran the loops back and found that they were only an hour long, and that the events of the afternoon had been erased.That would give them something to think about.He smiled grimly and told Pauline to get off the system.A wave of exhaustion swept through him.It was only eleven, but all adrenaline and the mornings dose of omegendorph had drained out of him, and he was tired.He sat on his bed, but then remembered what had last been there, and got up.In the end he slept on the floor.He was awakened in the timeslip by Spencer Jackson, with news of a body discovered in a robot hopper.He went and stood wearily beside Spencer in the clinic, staring at the body of Yashika Mui while several of the investigators eyed him warily.The diagnostic machinery was as good at autopsy as anything else, maybe better; tests of samples were indicating a blood coagulant.Somberly John ordered a full criminal autopsy; Muis body and clothes had to be scanned, and all microscopic particles read against his genome, and all foreign particles read against the list of people who were currently in Underhill.John stared at the UNOMA investigators as he gave this instruction, but they didnt blink.Probably they had been wearing gloves and walkers, or teleoperated the whole thing as he had.He had to turn away to hide his disgust; he couldnt let on that he knew!But then of course they knew that they had put the body there; and so they must suspect that he was the one who had removed it, and erased the camera tapes.So they already knew that he knew, or suspected he did.But they couldnt be sure; and there was no reason to give anything away.An hour later he went back to his room, and lay on the floor again.Although he was still exhausted, he could no longer sleep.He stared at the ceiling, thinking it over.Thinking over everything that he had learned.Near dawn he felt he had things sorted out.He gave up on sleep, and got up to go out for another walk; he needed to be outside, away from the human world and all its sickening corruption, out into the great rush of the wind, made so dramatically visible by the storms flying dust.But when he got out of the lock door, there were stars overhead.The complete net of them all the thousands burning as of old, without the slightest twinkle or flicker, the faint ones so dense that the black sky itself appeared slightly whitish, as if the whole sky were the Milky Way.When he had recovered from his astonishment, and the almost forgotten wonder of the stars, he got on his intercom and called in the news.It caused pandemonium.People heard and woke their friends, and rushed down to the changing rooms to grab a walker before the supply was exhausted.And the lock doors started opening and spewing out crowds.The sky to the east turned a blackish red, and then lightened quickly.The whole sky shifted to a dark rose shade, and then began to glow.The stars disappeared by the hundreds, until only Venus and the Earth hung in the east, over a growing intensity of light.The sky in the east grew brighter, and brighter again, until it seemed brighter than day could ever get; even behind faceplates peoples eyes watered, and some cried out over the common band at the sight.There were figures scampering around, the intercom babbling, the sky growing impossibly brighter, and brighter, and brighter yet, until it seemed it would burst; it pulsated with glowing pink light, the dots that were Venus and Earth overwhelmed by it.And then the sun cracked the horizon and fountained across the plain like a thermonuclear bomb, and the people roared and jumped up and down and ran among the long black shadows of the rocks and the buildings.All east facing walls were great blocks of Fauvist color, their glaze mosaics stunning, hard to look at directly.The air was clear as glass and indeed seemed a solid substance, imbuing the things stuck in it with razor edged clarity.John walked out away from the crowds, east toward Chernobyl.He turned his intercom off.The sky was a darker pink than he remembered, with a touch of purple at the zenith.Everyone in Underhill was going crazy.Many of the people there had never seen the sun shine on Mars, and no doubt it felt like they had lived their whole lives in the Great Storm.Now it was over, and they were wandering out in the sunshine drunk with it, slipping on pink ice left and right, getting in yellow snowball fights, climbing the frosted pyramids.When John saw that he turned, and went up the steps of the last pyramid himself, to have a look at the tors and hollows around Underhill.They were somewhat frosted and silted over, but otherwise just the same.He turned on the common band, but turned it back off people still inside were howling for walkers, and no one outside was paying any attention to them.It had been an hour since sunrise, one cried, though John found that hard to believe.He shook his head; the raucous voices, and the memory of the body on his bed, made it hard to feel much joy in the end of the storm.Eventually he went back inside, and gave his walker over to a pair of women his size who were squabbling over who got to use it next, and he went down to the comm center and called Sax in Echus Overlook.When he got him he congratulated him on the end of the storm.Sax waved this away brusquely, as if it had happened years before.Theyve boarded Amor 2051B, he said.This was the ice asteroid they had found for insertion into Martian orbit.They were in the process of installing rockets on it, which would knock it onto a course that would bring it in on a trajectory similar to the Ares.Without a heat shield the aerobraking would burn it up.All looked well for a MOI ETA about six months away.That was the big news, Sax implied in his blinking, calm way.The Great Storm was history.John had to laugh.But then he thought of Yashika Mui, and he told Sax about it because he wanted someone elses celebration to be ruined as well.Sax only blinked.Theyre getting serious, he finally said.Disgusted, John said good bye and got off.He wandered back out through the vaults, disturbed by a fiercely clashing mix of good and bad emotions.He returned to his room and took an omegendorph and one of the new pandorphs Spencer had given him, and then he went out into the quadrants central atrium and wandered among the plants, all skinny storm spawn, troping toward the lightbulbs running overhead.The sky was still a clear dark pink, still very bright.A lot of the people who had gone out first were now back and in the atrium between the rows of crops, partying.He ran into a few friends, some acquaintances, mostly strangers.He went back into the vaults, through rooms full of strangers who sometimes cheered when he walked in.If they yelled Speech!long enough he would stand on a chair and rattle something off, feeling the endorphins, which today were rendered unpredictable in their effect by the thought of the murdered man.Sometimes he was pretty vehement, and he never knew what he was going to say until it came out of him.We saw John Boone drunk on his ass, they would say, the day the Great Storm ended.Fine, he thought, let them say what they wanted.It never mattered what he did anymore anyway, as far as the legend was concerned.One room contained a crowd of Egyptians, not like his Sufis but orthodox Moslems, talking like the wind and drinking cups of coffee, high on caffeine and sunlight, flashing white smiles under their moustaches, extremely cordial for once, in fact pleased to see him there.He warmed to that, and flying on the momentum of the day he said, Look, were part of a new world.If you dont base your actions on Martian reality then you become a kind of schizophrenic, with your body on one planet and your spirit on another.No society split like that can function for long.Well, well, one of them said with a smile.You must understand we have traveled before.We are a traveling people.But wherever we are, Mecca is our spirits home.We could fly to the other side of the universe and that would still be true.Nothing to say to that; and in fact such direct honesty was so much cleaner than what he had been dealing with through the night that he nodded, and said, I see.I understand.Compare that after all to the hypocrisy of the West, where people talked of profit at prayer breakfasts, people who couldnt articulate a single belief they had; people who thought their values were physical constants, who would say Thats just the way things are, like Frank so often did.So John stayed and talked with the Egyptians for a while, and when he left them he was feeling better.He wandered back to his vault, listening to the rowdy voices pouring into the hallway from every room; shouts, shrieks, happy scientist talk, these things are such halophytes that they dont like brine because theres too much water in it, peals of laughter.He had an idea.Spencer Jackson lived in the vault next door to Johns, and was passing through when John hurried in, so John told him the idea.We ought to gather everyone we can for a big celebration of the storms end.All the sort of Mars centered groups, you know, or really everyone who can possibly make it.Anyone who wants to be there.Where?Up on Olympus Mons, he said without considering it.We could probably get Sax to time the arrival of his ice asteroid so that we could watch it from there.Good idea!Spencer said.Olympus Mons is a shield volcano, and therefore a cone that is not steep in most places, its great height resulting from its even greater breadth; it is twenty five kilometers higher than the surrounding plain, but eight hundred kilometers across, so its slope averages about six degrees.But around the circumference of its great bulk there is a circular escarpment some seven kilometers high, and this spectacular cliff, twice as tall as that at Echus Overlook, is in many places close to vertical.Sections of it had already lured the few climbers on the planet, but no one had yet succeeded in climbing it, and for most of the inhabitants of the planet it remained merely a stupendous impediment on the way to the summit caldera.Travelers on the ground made it up the escarpment by way of a wide ramp on the north side, where one of the last lava flows had overrun the cliff.Areologists told tales of what that must have been like, of a river of molten rock a hundred kilometers wide, too bright to look at, falling seven thousand meters onto the black lava crusted plain, piling higher and higher and higher ...This spill of lava had left a rampway with nothing more than a slight jog in it where the escarpment had been overrun; it was an easy ascent, and after it an uphill drive of some two hundred kilometers took one to the rim of the caldera.The summit rim of Olympus Mons is so broad and flat that while it has an excellent view down into the many ringed caldera, the rest of the planet cannot be seen from it.Looking outward one sees only the outer edge of the rim, and then the sky.But on the south side of the rim there is a small meteor crater, with no name but its map designation, THA Zp.The interior of this little crater is somewhat sheltered from the thin jet stream rushing over Olympus Mons, and standing on the southern arc of its fresh spiky rim, an observer finally has a view down the slope of the volcano, and then over the vast rising plain of west Tharsis; it is like looking down at the planet from a platform in low space.It took almost nine months before the asteroid was brought to a rendezvous with Mars, and word of Johns celebration had had time to get around.So they came in scattered rover caravans, in twos and fives and tens, up the north ramp and around to the southern outer slope of Zp.There they erected a number of big crescent shaped clear walled tents, with rigid clear floors that stood two meters off the ground, resting on clear entry stalks.They were the very latest thing in temporary shelter, in fact, and all set with their inner arcs facing uphill, so that when they were done they had a row of crescents stacked like stairs, like greenhouse gardens on a terraced hillside, overlooking the immense sweep of a bronze world.Every day for a week the caravans arrived, and dirigibles labored up the long slope, and were tethered inside Zp, filling it so that the interior of the little crater looked like a bowl of birthday balloons.The size of the crowd surprised John, as he had expected only a few friends to travel to such a remote site.It was yet another proof of his inability to comprehend the planets current population; there were nearly a thousand people gathered there together, it was amazing.Although many were faces he had seen before, and quite a few he knew by name.So it was a collection of friends, in a way.It was as if a home town that he hadnt known existed had suddenly sprung up around him.And many of the first hundred had come, forty of them in all, including Maya and Sax, Ann and Simon and Nadia and Arkady, Vlad and Ursula and the rest of the Acheron group, Spencer, Alex and Janet and Mary and Dmitri and Elena and the rest of the Phobos group, and Arnie and Sasha and Yeli and several more, some of whom he hadnt seen in twenty years everyone he was close to, in fact, except for Frank, who had said he was too busy, and Phyllis, who hadnt replied to the invitation at all.And it wasnt just the first hundred.Many of the others were old friends as well, or friends of friends a lot of Swiss, including the road building gypsies; Japanese from all over; most of the Russians on the planet; his Sufi friends.And all of them were scattered up and down the terraced crescent tents, in collections of caravan groups and dirigible teams, rushing from time to time to the locks to greet the latest arrivals.During the days many of them wandered around outside the tents, collecting loose rock from the great curved slope.The Zp meteors impact had scattered chunks of brecciated lava everywhere, including stishovite shatter cones like pottery shards, some dead black, others a bright blood red, or flecked with impact diamonds.An areological team from Greece started laying these in a pattern on the ground under the raised floor of their tent, and they had brought a little kiln with them, so they could glaze some shards yellow or green or blue, to accent their designs.This idea caught on as soon as others saw it, and within two days each clear tent floor stood over a flagged parquet with a mosaic design: circuitry maps, pictures of birds and fish, fractal abstracts, Escher drawings, the Tibetan calligraphy spelling Om Mani Padme Hum, maps of the planet and of smaller regions, equations, peoples faces, landscapes, and so on.John spent his time wandering from tent to tent, talking with people and enjoying the carnival atmosphere an atmosphere which did not preclude arguments, there were a lot of those but most people spent the time partying, talking, drinking, going out on excursions on the wavy surface of the old lava flows, making mosaic floors, and dancing to music made by various amateur bands.The best of these was a magnesium drum band, the instruments local, the players from Trinidad Tobago, a notorious transnational flag of convenience with a vigorous local resistance movement, of which the band were representatives.There was also a country western group with a good slide guitar player, and an Irish band with homemade instruments and a large shifting membership, which allowed it to play more or less nonstop.These three bands were all surrounded by crowds of dancers, and indeed the tents they occupied had all of their movement transformed into a kind of pulsing dance, as just getting from here to there was suddenly stuffed with the grace and exuberance of the music, the gravity, the view.So it was a great festival, and John was pleased, partying hard in every waking moment.He didnt need any omegendorph or pandorph, and once when Marian and the Senzeni Na crowd hustled him in a corner and started passing tabs around, he could only laugh.I dont think so right now, he said to the young hotheads, waving a hand weakly.Itd be carrying a coals to Newcastle at this point, really it would.Carrying coals to Newcastle?He means itd be like taking permafrost to Borealis.Or pumping more CO2 into the atmosphere.Bringing lava to Olympus.Putting more salt in the goddamn soil.Putting any more ferric oxide anywhere on the whole damn planet!Exactly, John said, laughing.Im already full red.Not as red as these folks, one of them said, pointing down to the west.A string of three sand colored dirigibles floated up the slope of the volcano.They were small and antiquated, and did not answer radio inquiries.By the time they had scraped over Zps rim and anchored among the larger and more colorful dirigibles in the crater, everyone was waiting to hear from the observers at the lock who they might be.When their gondolas popped open, and twenty or so figures in walkers stepped out, a silence fell.Thats Hiroko, Nadia said suddenly over the common band.The first hundred made their way quickly to the upper tent, looking up at the walktube that ran over the rim.And then the new visitors were walking down the tube to the tent lock, and were through and inside, and yes, it was Hiroko Hiroko, Michel, Evgenia, Iwao, Gene, Ellen, Rya, Raul, and a whole crowd of youngsters.Shrieks and shouts pierced the air, people were embracing, a few crying, and there were a good number of angry accusations; John himself couldnt help it when he got a chance to hug Hiroko, after all those hours in his rover worrying about things, wishing he could have talked to her; now he took her shoulders in his hands and almost shook her, ready for hot words to pour from his throat; but her grinning face was so much like his memory of her and yet not her face thinner and more lined, not her and yet clearly her that her face blurred and flowed in his vision, from what he expected to see to what he saw.He was confused enough by this hallucinatory smear (in his feelings too) that he only cried, Oh, Ive wanted to talk to you so!And me to you, she said, although it was hard to hear her in the din; Nadia was intervening between Maya and Michel, for Maya was shouting Why didnt you tell me?again and again, before bursting into tears.John was distracted by this, and then he saw Arkadys face over Hirokos shoulder, bunched in an expression that said, Theres going to be questions answered later, and he lost his train of thought.There were going to be some hard things said but still, here they were!Here they were.Down in the tents the noise level had jumped twenty decibels.People were cheering their reunion.Late in the afternoon John convened the first hundred, now numbering almost sixty.They gathered in the highest tent by themselves, and looked out over those below, and the land beyond.It was all so much huger than Underhill and the tight rocky plain around it.Everything had changed, it seemed; the world and its civilization all grown vastly larger and more complicated.And yet there they stood nevertheless, all the oh so familiar faces changed, aged in all the ways human faces age: time texturing them with erosion as if they had lived for geological ages, giving them a knowing look, as if one could see the aquifers behind their eyes.They were in their seventies now, most of them.And the world was indeed larger in many different ways: after all it was now quite possible that they were destined to watch each other age a lot more, if they were lucky.It was a strange sensation.So they milled about, looking at the people in the tents below, and beyond them to the variegated orange carpet of the planet; and the conversations rushed this way and that in quick chaotic waves, creating interference patterns, so that sometimes they all went still at once and stood there together, stunned or bemused or grinning like dolphins.In the tents below, people occasionally looked up through the plastic arcs at them, curious to catch a glimpse of such a historic meeting.Finally they sat in a scattering of chairs, passing around cheese and crackers and bottles of red wine.John leaned back in his chair and looked around.Arkady had one arm over Mayas shoulders, the other over Nadias, and the three of them were laughing at something Maya had said.Sax was blinking his owlish pleasure, and Hiroko was beaming.John had never seen that look on her face in the early years.It was a shame to disturb such a mood, but there would never be a good time; and the mood would return.So in a quiet moment he said to Sax in clear loud tones, I can tell you whos behind the sabotages.Sax blinked.You can?Yes.He looked Hiroko in the eye.Its your people, Hiroko.That sobered her, though she still smiled: but it was the contained, private smile of old.No no, she said mildly, and shook her head.You know I wouldnt do that.I figured not.But your people are doing it without your knowledge.Your children, in fact.Working with the coyote.Her eyes narrowed, and she threw a quick glance down at the tents below.When she looked at John again he went on.You grew them, right?Fertilized a bunch of your eggs, and grew them in vitro?After a pause she nodded.Hiroko!Ann said.You dont have any idea how well that ectogene process works!We tested it, Hiroko said.The kids have turned out all right.Now the whole group was silent, and watching Hiroko and John.He said, Maybe so, but some of them dont share your ideas.Theyre doing things on their own, like kids will.They have eyeteeth made of stone, isnt that right?Hiroko wrinkled her nose.Theyre crowns.A composite rather than true stone.A silly fashion.And a kind of badge.And there are people out on the surface who have picked it up, people in contact with your kids, helping them with the sabotages.I almost got killed by some of them in Senzeni Na.My guide there had a stone eyetooth, although it took me a long time to remember where it was I had seen it.I assume it was an accident that we were down there at the time the truck fell.I hadnt given them any warning I was going to visit, so I assume the whole thing was planned before I got there, and they didnt know to stop it.Okakura probably went down the hole thinking he was going to get squished like a bug for the cause.After another pause Hiroko said, Are you sure?Im pretty sure.It was confusing for a long time, because its not just them theres more than one thing going on.But when I remembered where I had seen that first stone tooth I looked into it, and I found out that a whole shipment of dental equipment from Earth arrived empty, back in 2044.A whole freighter ripped off.It made me think I was onto something.And then, the sabotages kept happening in places and at times when no one who was in the net could possibly have done it.Like that time I visited Mary at the Margaritifer aquifer, and the well housing was blown up.It was clear it hadnt been done by anyone stationed there, it just wasnt possible.But thats a really isolated station, and there was no one else anywhere nearby at the time.So it had to be someone outside the net.And so I thought of you.He shrugged apologetically.When you check it out, you find that about half the sabotages simply couldnt have been done by anyone in the net.And in the other half, someone with a stone tooth was usually spotted in the area.Its becoming a pretty widespread fashion now, but still.I figured it was you, and I had my AI do an analysis which showed that about three quarters of the cases have happened in the lower southern hemisphere, that or else inside a three thousand kilometer circle with the chaotic terrain at the east end of Marineris as its center point.Thats a circle that holds a lot of settlements, but even allowing for that it seemed to me the chaos was a logical place for the saboteurs to hide.And weve all figured for years that that was where you folks went when you left Underhill.Hirokos face revealed nothing.Finally she said, I will look into this.Good.Sax said, John, you said there was more than one thing going on?John nodded.It hasnt just been sabotage, you see.Someones been trying to kill me.Sax blinked, and the rest of them looked shocked.At first I thought it was the saboteurs, John said, trying to stop my investigation.It made sense, and the first incident really was an act of sabotage, so it was easy to get confused.But now Im pretty sure that that time was a mistake.The saboteurs arent interested in killing me they could have done it and they didnt.One night a group of them stopped me, including your son Kasei, Hiroko, and the coyote, who I take it is the same as the stowaway that you were hiding on the Ares  This caused an uproar apparently a fair number of them had had suspicions about this stowaway, and Maya rose to her feet and pointed a dramatic finger at Hiroko, crying out.John shouted them all down and forged on: Their visit their visit!that was the best proof of my theory about the sabotages, because I managed to get a few skin cells off one of them, and I was able to get his DNA read and compared with some other samples found at some of the sabotage sites, and this person had been there.So those were the saboteurs, but they werent trying to kill me, obviously.But one night at Hellas Low Point I was knocked down, and my walker cut open.He nodded at his friends exclamations.That was the first intentional attack on me, and it came pretty soon after I went up to Pavonis, and talked to Phyllis and a bunch of transnational types about internationalizing the elevator and so on.Arkady was laughing at him, but John ignored him and forged on.After that, I was harassed several times by UNOMA investigators that Helmut allowed to come up, and he did that under pressure from those same transnationals.And in fact I found out that most of those investigators had worked for Armscor or Subarishii on Earth, rather than for the FBI like they told me.Those are the transnationals most involved with the elevator project and the mining on the Great Escarpment, and now theyve got their own security people established everywhere, and this roving team of so called investigators.And then, just before the big storm ended, some of those investigators tried to get me accused of that murder that happened at Underhill.Yes they did!It didnt work, and I cant absolutely prove it was them, but I saw two of them working on the set up.And I think they killed that man, too, just to get me in trouble.To get me out of their way.You should tell Helmut, Nadia said.If we present a united front and insist that these people be sent back to Earth, I dont think he could deny us.I dont know how much real power Helmut has anymore, John said.But it would be worth a try.I want these people kicked off the planet.And those two in particular Ive got recorded by the Senzeni Na security system, both going into the med clinic and messing with the cleaning robots before I did.So the circumstantial evidence against them is about as strong as it could be.The others didnt know quite what to make of this, but it turned out that several of them had also been harassed by other UNOMA teams Arkady, Alex, Spencer, Vlad and Ursula, even Sax and they quickly agreed that an attempt to get the investigators deported was a good idea.Those two in particular ought to be deported at best, Maya said hotly.Sax simply tapped at his wristpad, and called Helmut up on the phone right then and there.He laid the situation out to Helmut, and the angry group pitched in from time to time.Well take this to the Terran press if you dont act on it, Vlad declared.Helmut frowned, and after a pause he said, Ill look into it.Those agents that you complain about in particular will be rotated back home, for sure.Check their DNA again before you let them go, John said.The murderer of that man in Underhill is among them, Im sure of it.We will check, Helmut said heavily.Sax cut the connection, and John looked around at his friends again.Okay, he said.But itll take more than a call to Helmut to make all the changes we need.The time has come to act together again, across a whole range of issues, if we want the treaty to survive.That as a minimum, you know.A start on the rest of it.We need to form a coherent political unit no matter what kind of disagreements we might have.It wont matter what we do, Sax said mildly, but he was jumped on immediately, in an incomprehensible babble of competing protests.It does matter!John cried.Weve got as much chance as anyone does of directing what happens here.Sax shook his head, but the others were listening to John, and most seemed to agree with him: Arkady, Ann, Maya, Vlad, each from their different perspective....It could be done, John could see it in their faces.Only Hiroko he could not read; her face was a blank, closed in a way that brought back a sharp pang of recollection.She had always been that way to John, and suddenly it made him ache with frustration and remembered pain, and he got annoyed.He stood, and waved a hand outward.It was nearing sunset, and the enormous curved plate of the planet was dappled with an infinite texture of shadows.Hiroko, can I have a word with you in private?Just for a second.We can go down into the tent below here.I just have a couple questions, and then we can come right back up.The others stared at them curiously.Under that gaze Hiroko finally bowed, and walked ahead of John to the tube down to the next tent.They stood at one tip of that tents crescent, under the gazes of their friends above, and the occasional observer below.The tent was mostly empty; people were respecting the first hundreds privacy by leaving a gap.You have suggestions for how I can identify the saboteurs?Hiroko said.You might start with the boy named Kasei, John said.The one that is a mix of you and me.She would not meet his eye.John leaned toward her, getting angry.I presume theres kids from every man in the first hundred?Hiroko tilted her head at him, and shrugged very slightly.We took from the samples everyone gave.The mothers are all the women in the group, the fathers all the men.What gave you the right to do all these things without our permission?John asked.To make our children without asking us to run away and hide in the first place why?Why?Hiroko returned his gaze calmly.We have a vision of what life on Mars can be.We could see it wasnt going to go that way.We have been proved right by what has happened since.So we thought we would establish our own life  But dont you see how selfish that is?We all had a vision, we all wanted it to be different, and weve been working as hard as we can for it, and all that time youve been gone, off creating a little pocket world for your little group!I mean we could have used your help!I wanted to talk to you so often!Here we have a kid between us, a mix of you and me, and you havent talked to me in twenty years!We didnt mean to be selfish, Hiroko said slowly.We wanted to try it, to show by experiment how we can live here.Someone has to show what you mean when you talk about a different life, John Boone.Someone has to live the life.But if you do it in secret then no one can see it!We never planned to stay secret forever.The situation has gotten bad, and so weve stayed away.But here we are now, after all.And when we are needed, when we can help, we will appear again.Youre needed every day!John said flatly.Thats how social life works.Youve made a mistake, Hiroko.Because while youve been hiding, the chances for Mars remaining its own place have gone way down, and a lot of people have been working to speed that disappearance, including some of the first hundred.And what have you done to stop them?Hiroko said nothing.John went on: I suppose youve been helping Sax a little in secret.I saw one of your notes to him.But thats another thing I object to helping out some of us and yet not others.We all do that, Hiroko said, but she looked uncomfortable.Have you had the gerontological treatments in your colony?Yes.And you got the process from Sax?Yes.Do these kids of yours know their parentage?Yes.John shook his head, exasperated and more.I just cant believe you would do these things!We do not ask for your belief.Obviously not.But arent you the least bit concerned about stealing our genes and making kids by us without our knowledge or consent?About bringing them up without giving us any part in their upbringing, any part in their childhood?She shrugged.You can have your own kids if you want.As for these, well.Were any of you interested in having children twenty years ago?No.The subject never came up.We were too old!We were not too old.We chose not to think of it.Most ignorance is by choice, you know, and so ignorance is very telling about what really matters to people.You did not want children, and so you did not know about late birth.But we did, and so we learned the techniques.And when you meet the results, I think you will see it was a good idea.I think you will thank us.What have you lost, after all?These children are ours.But they have a genetic link to you, and from now on they will exist for you, as an unexpected gift, say.As a quite extraordinary gift.Her Mona Lisa smile appeared and disappeared.The concept of the gift, again.John paused to think about it.Well, he finally said.Well be talking about that for a long time, I suspect.Twilight had turned the atmosphere below them into a dark purple band, running like a velvet border around the black star studded bowl which had appeared over their heads.In the tents below they were singing, led by the Sufis: Harmakhis, Mangala, Nirgal, Auqakuh; Harmakhis, Mangala, Nirgal, Auqakuh, and around again, time after time, adding grace notes that were other names for Mars, and encouraging the bands already there to add instrumental accompaniments of all kinds, until every tent was filled with this song, all of them singing together.The Sufis then began their whirling, and little knots of dancers swirled all through the crowds.Will you at least stay in contact with me now?John said intently to Hiroko.Will you give me that?Yes.They returned to the upper tent, and the group went down together into the general party, and joined the celebration.John made his way slowly to the Sufis, and tried the spins he had learned from them on their mesa, and people cheered and caught him when he spun out of control into the spectators.After one fall he was helped to his feet by the thin faced man with dreadlocks who had led the midnight visit to his rover.Coyote!John cried.Its me, the man said, and his voice caused a ripple of electricity down Johns spine.But no reason for alarm.He offered John a flask; after a moments hesitation John took it and drank.Fortune favors the bold, he thought.Tequila, apparently.Youre Coyote!he shouted over the music of the magnesium drum band.The man grinned widely and nodded once, took the flask back and drank.Is Kasei with you?No.He doesnt like this meteor.And then with a friendly slap to the arm the man moved off into the swirling crowd.He looked over his shoulder and shouted, Have fun!John watched him disappear among the faces in the crowd, feeling the tequila burn in his stomach.The Sufis, Hiroko, now Coyote: the gathering was blessed.He saw Maya and hurried over to her and threw an arm over her shoulder, and they walked through the tents and the connecting tunnels, and people toasted them as they passed.The semi rigid tent floors were gently bouncing up and down.The countdown reached two minutes, and many people ascended to the upper tents, and then pressed against the clear walls of the south facing arcs.The ice asteroid would probably burn up in a single orbit, its injection trajectory was so steep; an object a quarter the size of Phobos burned to steam and then, as it got hotter, to oxygen and hydrogen molecules.And all in a matter of minutes.No one could be sure what it would look like.So they stood there, some of them still singing the chords of the name round.A final countdown was picked up by more and more of them, until they were all into the last ten, shouting out the reversed sequence of numbers at the top of their lungs, in the astronauts primal scream.They roared out zero!and for three breathless heartbeats nothing happened; then a white ball trailing a blazing fan of white fire came shooting up over the southwestern horizon, as big as the comet in the Bayeux Tapestry, and brighter than all the moons and mirrors and stars combined, Burning ice, bleeding across the sky, white on black, hurtling fast and low, so low that it was not much higher than they were on Olympus, so low that they could see white chunks bursting back through the tail and falling away like giant sparks.Then about halfway across the sky it broke into fragments, and the whole collection of incandescent blazes tumbled east, scattering like buckshot.All the stars suddenly shuddered it was the first sonic boom, striking the tents and shaking them.A second boom followed, and the phosphor chunks bounced wildly for a moment as they tumbled down the sky and disappeared over the southeast horizon.Their firedrake tails followed them into Mars, and disappeared, and it was suddenly dark again, the ordinary night sky standing overhead as if nothing had happened.Except the stars were twinkling.After all that anticipation, the passage had taken no more than three or four minutes.The celebrants had mostly gone silent at the sight, but many had cried out involuntarily at the sight of the breakup, as during a fireworks show; and again at the impact of the two sonic booms.Now, in the old dark, the silence was complete, and people stood in their tracks.What could you do after something like that?But there was Hiroko, making her way down through the tents to the one where John and Maya and Nadia and Arkady were standing together.As she walked she chanted, in a tone that was quiet but carried throughout each tent she crossed: Al Qahira, Ares, Auqakuh, Bahram.Harmakhis, Hrad, Huo Hsing, Kasei.Maadim, Maja, Mamers, Mangala.Mawrth, Nirgal, Shalbatanu, Simud and Tiu.She walked through the crowd right to John, and facing him she plucked up his right hand and pulled it aloft, and suddenly shouted, John Boone!John Boone!And then everyone was cheering and yelling Boone!Boone!Boone!Boone!and others were shouting Mars!Mars!Mars!Johns face blazed like the meteor had, and he felt stunned, as if a piece of it had pinged him on the head.His old friends were laughing at him, and Arkady yelled Speech!in what he imagined was an American accent: Speech!Speech!Speeeeeeeeeech!Others picked this up, and after a time the noise died down, and they watched him expectantly, laughter rippling through them at the sight of his slack faced astonishment.Hiroko released his hand, and he raised the other one helplessly, holding both overhead with palms outstretched.What can I say, friends?he cried.This is the thing itself, there are no words for this.This is what words ask for.But his blood ran high with adrenaline, with tequila and omegendorph and happiness, and without willing it the words spilled out of him as they so often had before.Look, he said, here we are on Mars!(Laughter. )Thats our gift and a great gift it is, the reason we have to keep giving all our lives to keep the cycle going, its like in eco economics where what you take from the system has to be balanced by what you give in to it, balanced or exceeded to create that anti entropic surge which characterizes all creative life and especially this step across to a new world, this place that is neither nature nor culture, transformation of a planet into a world and then a home.Now we all know that different people have different reasons for being here and just as important the people who sent us up had different reasons for sending us, and now were beginning to see the conflicts caused by those differences, there are storms brewing on the horizon, meteors of trouble flying in and some of them are going to strike dead on rather than skip overhead like that blaze of white ice just did!(Cheers. )It may get ugly, at times it almost certainly will get ugly, so we have to remember that just as these meteor strikes enrich the atmosphere, thicken it and add the elixir oxygen to the poison soup outside these tents, the human conflicts coming down may do the same, melting the permafrost at our social base, melting all those frozen institutions away and leaving us with the necessity of creation, the imperative to invent a new social order that is purely Martian, as Martian as Hiroko Ai, our own Persephone now come back up out of the regolith to announce the start of this new spring!(Cheers. )Now I know I used to say that we had to invent it all from scratch but in these last few years traveling around and meeting you all Ive seen that I was wrong to say that, its not like we have nothing and are being forced to conjure forms godlike out of the vacuum we have the genes you might say, the memes as Vlad says meaning our cultural genes, so that its in the nature of an act of genetic engineering what we do here, we have the DNA pieces of culture all made and broken and mixed by history, and we can choose and cut and clip together from whats best in that gene pool, knit it all together the way the Swiss did their constitution, or the Sufis their worship, or the way the Acheron group made their latest fast lichen, a bit from here and there, whatevers appropriate, keeping in mind the seven generations rule, thinking seven generations back and seven generations forward, and seven times seven if you ask me because now its our lives were talking about extending way off into the years, we dont know how that will affect us yet, but its certainly true that altruism and self interest have collapsed together more tightly than ever before.But also its still and always our childrens lives and our childrens children and on down forever that we have to think of, we must act in a way that gives them just as many chances as we have been given and hopefully more, channeling the suns energy in ever more ingenious ways to reverse the flow of entropy in this little pocket of the universal flow.And I know thats an awfully general way of putting it when this treaty that orders our lives here is coming up for renewal so soon, but we have to keep that level in mind because whats coming is not just a treaty but more a kind of constitutional congress, because were dealing with the genome of our social organization here, you can do this, you cant do that, you have to do this, to eat or to give.And weve been living by a set of rules established for empty land, the Antarctic treaty so fragile and idealistic which has held that cold continent free of intrusion for so long, up until the last decade in fact when its been chipped away at, and thats a sign of whats beginning to happen here too.The encroachment on that set of rules has begun everywhere, like a parasite feeding on the edges of its host organism, because thats what the replacement set of rules is, the old parasitic greed of the kings and their henchmen, this system we call the transnational world order is just feudalism all over again, a set of rules that is anti ecologic, it does not give back but rather enriches a floating international elite while impoverishing everything else, and so of course the so called rich elite are in actuality poor as well, disengaged from real human work and therefore from real human accomplishment, parasitical in the most precise sense, and yet powerful too as parasites that have taken control can be, sucking the gifts of human work away from their rightful recipients which are the seven generations, and feeding on them while increasing the repressive powers that keep them in place!(Cheers. )So its democracy versus capitalism at this point, friends, and we out on this frontier outpost of the human world are perhaps better positioned than anyone else to see this and to fight this global battle, theres empty land here, theres scarce and nonrenewable resources here, and were going to get swept up into the fight and we cannot choose not to be part of it, we are one of the prizes and our fate will be decided by what happens throughout the human world.That being the case, we had better band together for the common good, for Mars and for us and for all the people on earth and for the seven generations, its going to be hard its going to take years, and the stronger we are the better our chances, which is why Im so happy to see that burning meteor in the sky pumping the matrix of life into our world, and why Im so happy to see you all here to celebrate it together, a representative congress of all that I love in this world, but look I think that steel drum band is ready to play arent you (shouts of assent) so why dont you folks start and well dance till dawn and tomorrow scatter on the winds and down the sides of this great mountain, to carry the gift everywhere.Mad cheers.The magnesium drum band picked them up into its staccato flurry of plinks and plonks, and the crowd heaved into motion again.They partied all night long.John spent the time wandering from tent to tent, shaking hands and hugging people, Thanks, thanks, thanks.I dont know, I dont remember what I said.But this is what I meant all along, this right here.His old friends laughed at him.Sax, drinking coffee and looking supremely relaxed, said to him, Syncretism is it?Very interesting, very well put with the tiniest of smiles.Maya kissed him, Vlad and Ursula and Nadia kissed him; Arkady lifted him up and with a great roar swirled him around in the air, giving him a hairy kiss on each cheek and shouting, Hey, John, could you repeat that please?hooting at the very thought.You amaze me, John, you always amaze me!And Hiroko with her private smile, with Michel and Iwao beside her, grinning at him....Michel said, I think this is what Maslow meant by the term peak experience, and Iwao groaned and elbowed him, while Hiroko reached out and touched John on the arm with her forefinger, as if to pass along a certain animating touch, a power, a gift.The next day they sorted and bagged the party wreckage and took down the tents, leaving the flagstone terraces behind, like strands of a cloisonn necklace draped down the side of the old black volcano.They said good bye to the dirigible crews, and the dirigibles drifted down the slope like balloons slipped from a childs fist; the sand colored ones of the hidden colony got hard to see very quickly.As he got in his rover with Maya John said good byes, and as they drove around the rim of Olympus Mons they caravanned with rovers containing Arkady and Nadia, and Ann and Simon and their son Peter.In conversations that day John said, We need to talk to Helmut, and get the U. N.  to accept us as speakers at large for the local population.And we need to present the U. N.  with a draft of the revised treaty.Around Ls ninety Im scheduled to go to a dedication ceremony for a new tent city on east Tharsis.Helmut is supposed to be there, maybe we could meet then?Only a few of them could make it, but they were named delegates for the rest, and the plan was agreed on.After that they talked about what the contents of the draft treaty should be, calling around to all the caravans and the dirigibles.The next day they came to the ramp down the northern escarpment, and at its foot they took off each in a different direction.That was a good party!John said over the radio to each in turn.See you at the next one!The Sufis rolled by while they were stopped, and they waved from their windows and came on the radio to say good bye as well.John recognized the voice of the old woman who had tended him at the toilet after his dance in the storm; as he was waving at their caravan she said over the radio,  Whether it be of this world or of that,  Your love will lead us yonder at the last.Part 6    Guns Under the Table      The day John Boone was assassinated we were up on east Elysium and it was morning and this meteor shower came raining down on us, there must have been thirty streaks or so and they were all black, I dont know what those meteorites were made of but they burned black instead of white.Like smoke from crashing planes except straight and fast as lightning.It was so strange to see that we all were amazed and we hadnt even yet heard the news, but when we did we figured back, and it happened at exactly the same time.We were down in Hellas Lakefront and the sky went dark and a sudden wind whipped over the lake and blew every walktube in that town away, and then we heard.We were in Senzeni Na where he worked a lot, and it was night and lightning started hammering us, giant bolts of lightning were shooting right down into the mohole, no one could believe it, and it was so loud you couldnt hear.And there was a picture of him down in the workers quarters, up on the wall of one suite, and a lightning bolt hit the concourse window and everyone was blinded for a second, and when our sight returned the frame of that picture was busted and the glass cracked and it was smoking.And then we heard the news.We were in Carr and we couldnt believe it.All the first hundred there were crying, he must have been the only one in that whole gang that everyone liked, if most of them were killed a good half of the rest would be cheering.Arkady was out of his mind, he cried for hours and it was so scary because it was so unlike him, Nadia kept trying to comfort him and she was saying Its all right, its all right and Arkady kept saying Its not all right, its not all right, and roaring and throwing things and then falling into Nadias arms again, even Nadia was freaked.And that was when he ran off to his room and came back with one of the ignition transmitter boxes, and when he explained what it was Nadia got really furious at all of us, she said Why would you ever do a thing like that?And Arkady was crying and yelling What do you mean why?Because of this, because of what just happened to John, they killed him, they killed him!Who knows which of us will be next!Theyll kill all of us if they can!And Nadia kept trying to give the transmitter back and he got so upset, he kept making her hold it saying Please Nadia please, just in case, just in case, please, until finally she had to keep it to get him to calm down.I never saw anything like it.We were in Underhill and the power went off, and when it came back on every plant in the farm had frozen solid.The lights and heat came back on and the plants all began to wilt.We sat around all night telling stories about him.I remembered what it was like when he first touched down back in the twenties, a lot of us did.I was just a kid at the time but I remember everyone laughing at his first words, I thought it was funny myself but I remember being very surprised that all the adults were laughing too, everyone was so tickled, I think everyone fell in love with him at that moment, I mean how could you not like someone who was the first person on another planet walking out there and saying Well, here we are.It was impossible not to like him.Oh I dont know.I saw him punch a man once, it was on the Burroughs train and he was in our car obviously high, and there was this woman who had some kind of deformity, a big nose and no chin and when she went down to the toilets some guy said My Lord that woman has really been beat hard with the ugly stick, and Boone bam!knocks him into the next seat and says, There is no such thing as an ugly woman.Thats what he thought.That is what he thought, why he slept with a different woman every night, and he didnt care what they looked like.Or how old they were, he had to talk fast when they found him with that fifteen year old.I dont suppose Toitovna ever heard of that one or it would have been his balls, and hundreds of women would have gone wanting.He used to like to do it in two person gliders with the woman on top of him while he piloted.Oh man once I saw him pull a glider out of a downdraft that would have killed anyone else, it was a shear off and it would have ripped the glider apart if hed tried to resist it, but he just went with it and the plane dropped like a Rickover a thousand meters in a second, three or four times terminal velocity, and then when it was about to go smash he just tweaked it to the side and up and pancaked it in about twenty meters.Came out with his nose and ears bleeding.He was the best pilot on Mars, he could fly like an angel.Hell the whole first hundred wouldve been dead if he hadnt hand flown them into their orbital insertion, thats what I heard.There were people who hated him.And with good reason too.He stopped the mosque on Phobos from being built.And he could be cruel, Ive never met a man more arrogant.We were on Olympus Mons and the whole sky went black.Well, back before the beginning, Paul Bunyan came to Mars, and he brought his blue ox Babe with him.He walked around looking for lumber and his every footprint cracked the lava and left a rift canyon.He was so tall that he could reach into the asteroid belt while he walked around, and he chewed those rocks like Bing cherries and spit the pits out and boom there would be another crater.And then he ran into Big Man.It was the first time Paul had ever seen anyone bigger than himself, and believe me Big Man was bigger the usual two magnitudes, and that aint just twice as big let me tell you.But Paul Bunyan didnt care.When Big Man said Lets see what you can do with that axe of yours Paul said Sure, and with one stroke he hit the planet so hard that all the cracks of Noctis appeared at once.But then Big Man scratched the same spot with his toothpick, and the entire Marineris system yawned open.Lets try bare fists, Paul said, and he landed a right cross on the southern hemisphere and there was Argyre.But Big Man tapped a spot nearby with his pinky and there was Hellas.Try spitting, Big Man suggested, and Paul spat and Nirgal Vallis ran as long as the Mississippi.But Big Man spat and all the big outflow channels ran at once.Try shitting!Big Man said, and Paul squatted and pushed out Ceraunius Tholus but Big Man threw back his butt and there was the Elysium massif right next to it, steaming hot.Do your worst, Big Man suggested.Take a shot at me.And so Paul Bunyan picked him up by the toe and swung his whole bulk around and slammed him into the North Pole so hard that that whole northern hemisphere is depressed to this day.But without even getting up Big Man grabbed Paul by the ankle, and caught up his blue ox Babe in that same fist, and swung them into the ground and slammed them right through the planet and almost out the other side.And thats the Tharsis Bulge Paul Bunyan, almost sticking out Ascraeus his nose, Pavonis his cock, and Arsia his big toes.And Babe is off to one side, pushing up Olympus Mons.The blow killed Babe and Paul Bunyan both, and after that Paul had to admit that he was beat.But his own bacteria ate him, naturally, and they crawled all around down on the bedrock and under the megaregolith, down there going everywhere, sucking up the mantle heat, and eating the sulfides, and melting down the permafrost.And everywhere they went down there, every one of those little bacteria said I am Paul Bunyan.Its a matter of will, Frank Chalmers said to his face in the mirror.The phrase was the only residue of the dream he had been having when he awoke.He shaved with quick decisive strokes, feeling tense, crammed with energy ready to be unleashed, wanting to get to work.More residue: Whoever wants it the most wins!He showered and dressed, padded down to the dining hall.It was just after dawn.Sunlight flooded Isidis with horizontal beams of red bronze light, and high in the eastern sky cirrus clouds looked like copper shavings.Rashid Niazi, the Syrian representative to the conference, passed by and gave Chalmers a cool nod.Frank returned it and walked on.Because of Selim el Hayil, the Ahad wing of the Moslem Brotherhood had gotten blamed for Boones assassination, and Chalmers had always been quick and public in defending them from all such accusations.Selim had been a lone assassin, he always asserted, a mad murder suicide.This underlined the Ahads guilt while at the same time commanding their gratitude.Naturally Niazi, an Ahad leader, was a bit frustrated.Maya came into the dining room and Frank greeted her cordially, automatically covering the discomfort he always felt in her presence.May I join you?she said, watching him.Of course.Maya was perceptive, in her way; Frank concentrated on the moment.They chatted.The subject of the treaty began to come up, and so Frank said, How I wish John were here now.We could use him.And then: I miss him.This kind of thing would distract Maya instantly.She put her hand over his; Frank scarcely felt it.She was smiling, her arresting gaze full on him.Despite himself he had to look away.The TV wall was showing the news package beamed up from Earth, and he tapped on the table console and turned up the sound.Earth was in bad shape.The video was of a massive protest march in Manhattan, the whole island packed with a crowd the protesters would call ten million and the police five hundred thousand.The helicopter images were quite arresting, but there were a lot of places these days that, although less visual, were much more dangerous.In the advanced nations people were marching because of draconian birth reduction acts, laws that made the Chinese look like anarchists, and the young had erupted in fury and dismay, feeling their lives pulled out of their hands by a great crowd of ancient unnatural undead, by history itself come alive.That was bad, sure.But in the developing countries they were rioting over inadequate access to the treatments themselves, and that was far worse.Governments were falling; people were dying by the thousands.Really these images of Manhattan were probably meant to reassure; everythings still orderly!they said.People conducting themselves in a civil manner, even if it be civil disobedience.But Mexico City and So Paulo and New Delhi and Manila were in flames.Maya looked at the screen and read aloud one of the Manhattan banners: send the old to mars.Thats the essence of a bill someones introduced in Congress.Reach a hundred and youre off, to retirement orbitals, the moon, or here.Especially here.Maybe, he said.I suppose that explains their stubbornness about emigration quotas.Frank nodded.Well never get those.Theyre under too much pressure down there, and were seen as one of the few escape valves.Did you see that program aired on Eurovid about all the open land on Mars?Maya shook her head.It was like a real estate ad.No.If the U. N.  delegates gave us any say in emigration, theyd be crucified.So what do we do?He shrugged.Insist on the old treaty at every point.Act like every change is the end of the world.So thats why you were so crazy about the preface material.Sure.That stuff may not be all that important, but were like the British at Waterloo.If we give at any point the whole line collapses.She laughed.She was pleased with him, she admired his strategy.And it was a good strategy, although it was not the one he was pursuing.For they were not like the British at Waterloo; they were if anything like the French, making a last ditch assault which they had to win if they wanted to survive.And so he had been very busy giving in on many points in the treaty, hoping to thrust forward and hold on to what he really wanted in other areas.Which certainly included some remaining role for the American Martian Department, and its Secretary; after all, he needed a base from which to work.So he shrugged, dismissing her pleasure.On the TV wall the crowds boiled up and down the great avenues.He clenched his teeth a few times.Wed better get to it again.Upstairs the conferees were milling about in a sequence of long high rooms that were divided by tall partitions.Sunlight streamed into the big central room from the eastern meeting chambers, throwing a ruddy glare over the white pile carpet and the squarish teak chairs and the dark pink stone of the long tabletop.Knots of people were chatting casually against the walls.Maya went off to confer with Samantha and Spencer.The three of them were now the leaders of the MarsFirst coalition, and as such had been invited to the conference as nonvoting representatives of the Martian population: the peoples party, the tribunes, and the only ones there actually elected to their positions, although they were there only at Helmuts sufferance.Helmut had been as inclusive as anyone could ask.He had allowed Ann to attend as a nonvoting member representing the Reds, even though they were part of the coalition; Sax was there observing for the terraforming team; and any number of mining and development executives were observing as well.There was a whole crowd of observers, in fact; but the voting members were the only ones to sit at the central table, where Helmut was now ringing a small bell.Fifty three national representatives and eighteen U. N.  officials took their seats, and another hundred continued to wander in the eastern rooms, watching the discussion through the open portals or on small TVs.Outside the windows, Burroughs crawled with figures and vehicles, moving around in the clear walled mesas, and the tents on and between the mesas, and in the network of connecting clear walktubes that lay on the ground or arched through the air, and in the huge valley tent with its wide streetgrass boulevards and its canals.A little metropolis.Helmut called the session to order.In the eastern rooms people clustered around the TVs.Frank glanced through a portal into the east room nearest him; there would be rooms like that all over Mars and Earth, thousands of them, with millions of observers.Two worlds watching.The days topic, as it had been for the past two weeks, was emigration quotas.China and India had a joint proposal to make, which the head of the Indian office rose and read in his musical Bombay English.Stripped of camouflage it came down to a proportional system, of course.Chalmers shook his head.India and China between them had 40 percent of the worlds population, but they were only two votes of fifty three at this conference, and their proposal would never pass.The Brit in the European delegation rose to point out this fact, not in so many words of course.Wrangling began.It would go on all morning.Mars was a real prize, and the rich and poor nations of Earth were struggling over it as they were over everything else.The rich had the money but the poor had the people, and the weapons were pretty evenly distributed, especially the new viral vectors that could kill everyone on a continent.Yes, the stakes were high, and the situation existed in the most fragile of balances, the poor surging up out of the south and pressing the northern barriers of law and money and pure military force.Gun barrels in their faces, in essence.But now there were so many faces, a human wave attack might explode at any instant, it seemed, just from the expansive pressure of sheer numbers attackers shoved over the barricades by the press of babies in the rear, raging for their chance at immortality.At the midmorning break, with nothing more accomplished, Frank rose from his seat.He had heard little of the wrangle, but he had been thinking, and his lecterns sketchpad was marked up with a rough schematic.Money, people, land, guns.Old equations, old trade offs.But it wasnt originality he was after; it was something that would work.Nothing would happen at the long table itself, that was certain.Someone had to cut the knot.He got up and wandered over to the Indian and Chinese delegation, a group of about ten conferring in a camera free side room.After the usual exchange of pleasantries he invited the two leaders, Hanavada and Sung, to take a walk on the observation bridge.After a glance at each other, and quick conversations in Mandarin and Hindi with their aides, they agreed.So the three delegates walked out of the rooms and down the corridors to the bridge, a rigid walktube which began at the wall of their mesa and arched out over the valley and into the side of an even taller mesa to the south.The bridges height gave it an airy flying magnificence, and there were quite a few people walking its four kilometers, or just standing midway and taking in the view of Burroughs.Look, Chalmers said to his two colleagues, the expense of emigration is so great that you will never ease your population problems by moving them here.You know that.And you already have lots more reclaimable land in your own countries.So what you want from Mars isnt land but resources, or money.Mars is leverage to get your share of resources back home.Youre lagging behind the North because of resources that were taken from you without payment during the colonial years, and you should have repayment for that now.I am afraid that in a very real sense the colonial period never ended, Hanavada said politely.Chalmers nodded.Thats what transnational capitalism means were all colonies now.And theres tremendous pressure on us here to alter the treaty so that most of the profits from local mining become the property of the transnationals.The developed nations are feeling that very strongly.This we know, Hanavada said, nodding.Okay.And now youve made the pitch for proportional emigration, which is just as logical as allotting profits proportional to investment.But neither of these proposals is in your best interest.The emigration would be a drop in the bucket to you, but the money wouldnt.Meanwhile the developed nations have a new population problem, so a chance at a larger share of emigration would be welcome.And they can spare the money, which would mostly go to transnationals anyway and become free floating capital, outside any national control.So why shouldnt the developed nations give you more of it?It wouldnt really be coming out of their pocket anyway.Sung nodded quickly, looking solemn.Perhaps they had foreseen this response, and had made their proposal to stimulate it, and were waiting for him to play his part.But that just made it easier.Do you think your governments will agree to such a trade?Sung asked.Yes, Chalmers said.What is it but governments reasserting their power over the transnationals?Sharing the profits resembles in a way your old nationalization movements, only this time all countries would benefit.Internationalization, if you will.It will cut down on investments by the corporations, Hanavada noted.Which will please the Reds, Chalmers said.Please most of the MarsFirst group, in fact.And your government?Hanavada asked.I can guarantee it.Actually the administration would be a problem.But Frank would deal with them when the time came, they were a bunch of Chamber of Commerce kids these days, arrogant but stupid.Tell them it was this or a Third World Mars, a Chinese Mars, a Hindu Chinese Mars, with little brown people and cows unmolested in the walktubes.They would come around.In fact they would hide behind his knees yelling for protection, Grandpa Chalmers please save me from the yellow horde.He watched the Indian and the Chinese look at each other, in a completely scrutable consultation.Hell, he said, this is what you were hoping for, right?Perhaps we should work on some figures, Hanavada said.It took much of the next month to implement the compromise, as it entailed a whole set of corollary compromises to get all the voting delegations to accept it.Every nations delegate had to get a cut to show the folks back home.And there was Washington to be convinced as well; in the end Frank had to go over the heads of the kids right to the President, who was only a bit older than them, but could see a deal when it was poking him in the sternum.So Frank was busy, meetings nearly sixteen hours a day in his old pattern, as familiar as the sunrise.In the end, mollifying transnat lobbyists like Andy Jahns was the hardest part essentially impossible, as the deal was being made at their expense and they knew it.They put all the pressure they could on the northern governments and on their flags of convenience, and that was considerable, as evidenced by the Presidents scared irritability, and the defection of Singapore and Sofia from the deal.But Frank convinced the President, even across all that space, even across the deep psychological barrier of the time lag.And he used the same arguments with every other northern government.If you give in to the transnationals, he would say, then theyre the real government of the world.This is the chance to assert the interests of you and your population over those free floating accumulations of capital which are very near to holding the ultimate power on earth!You need to get them on the leash somehow!And it was the same at the U. N. , for every official there.Who do you want to be the real world government?You or them?Still, it was a close thing.The pressures the transnats could bring to bear were awesome, it was impressive to watch.Subarashii and Armscor and Shellalco were each bigger than all but the ten largest countries or commonwealths, and they really put out the funds.Money equals power; power makes the law; and law makes government.So that the national governments in trying to restrain the transnats were like the Lilliputians trying to tie down Gulliver.They needed a great network of tiny lines, staked into place along every millimeter of the circumference.And as the giant heaved to free itself and start trampling about, they had to rush from side to side, throw new lines over the monster, hammer new little pin stakes into place.Rush around making quarter hour pin stake appointments, for sixteen hours a day.Mad Dutch boy juggling.Andy Jahns, one of Franks oldest corporate contacts, took him to dinner one night.Andy was angry with Chalmers, naturally, but tried to hide it, as the evenings business consisted of the offer of a bribe thinly disguised, accompanied by threats thinly veiled.Business as usual, in other words.He offered Chalmers a position as head of a foundation which was being set up by the Earth to Mars transport consortium the old aerospace industries, with their old Pentagon stash still sloshing around in their pockets.This new foundation would assist the consortium to make policy, and advise the U. N.  on Mars related matters.The position was to begin after his tenure as Secretary for Mars was over, to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest.It sounds marvelous, Chalmers said.Im very interested indeed.And over the course of the dinner he convinced Jahns he was sincere.Not only about taking the position in the foundation, but in working for the consortium immediately.This was work indeed, but he was good at it; he could see the suspicion slowly leak out of Jahns as the evening wore on.The weakness of businessmen was their belief that money was the point of the game; they worked 14 hour days in order to earn enough of it to buy cars with leather interiors, they thought it was a sensible recreation to play around with it in casinos idiots, in short.But useful idiots.Ill do what I can, Chalmers promised energetically, and outlined some strategies he would start to pursue at once.Talk to the Chinese about their need for land, get Congress back to the idea of a fair return on investments.Certainly.Make promises here and some of the pressure would subside meanwhile the work could go on.There was no pleasure like double crossing a crook.So he went back to the conference table and carried on as before.The walk on the bridge, as it was now being called (others called it the Chalmers Shift), had broken the impasse.February 6th, 2057 Ls = 144, M 15: a red letter date in the history of diplomacy.Now it was a matter of giving everyone else a piece, and fixing the actual numbers.As this process ground along Chalmers talked with all the first hundred observers there, reassuring them and checking their opinions.Sax, it turned out, was upset with him, because he thought that if the transnats ceased investment his terraforming would have to slow considerably.He saw all the arriving business as heat.And yet Ann too was upset with him, because a new treaty based on the shift would allow both emigration and investment, and she and the Reds had been hoping for a treaty that would give Mars a kind of world park status.That kind of disconnection from reality made him crazy.Ive just saved you fifty million Chinese immigrants, he yelled at her, and you bitch at me because I havent managed to send everyone back home.You bitch because I didnt work a miracle and turn this rock into a holy shrine, right next door to a world thats beginning to look like Calcutta on a bad day.Ann, Ann, Ann.What would you have done?What would you have done except stalk around glaring at every single fucking thing people said, and convincing everyone that youre from Mars?Jesus Christ.Go out and play with your rocks and leave the politics to people who can think.Remember what thinking is, Frank, she said.Somehow he had made her smile for a second there, in the middle of his tirade.But she laid the same old wild glare on him before she left.But Maya, now Maya was pleased with him.He could feel her gaze on him when he talked in the public meetings.Millions of people watching, and he felt only that gaze.It made him angry.She was full of admiration for the bridge walk, and he told her only what she would be pleased to hear about the backstage compromises he was making in order to get it accepted.She began joining him every evening during the cocktail hour, approaching him when the first press of critics and supplicants had ebbed, standing by his side through the second and third waves, watching and easing things along with her laugh, and extricating him from time to time with reminders that they had to go out and eat.Then they would go out onto restaurant terraces under the stars, and eat and then sip coffee, looking over the orange tiles and roof gardens under one of the big mesa topping tents, feeling the evening breeze just as if they were out in the open.The MarsFirst crowd had committed themselves to his plan, so he had most of the locals, and he had the home office, and those were the two most important single parties in the whole process, he judged, aside from the transnational leadership, which he could do little about.So it was only a matter of time before he would work the deal.As he would tell her, sometimes, late in the evenings when he had fallen a bit under her spell.Been calmed by her.Between us well get it done, he would say as he looked up at the vivid stars in the sky, unable to meet her penetrating gaze.And one night she kept returning to his side during the cocktail gathering.With all the others they watched the terran news reports of the days progress, and saw again how oddly distorted and flattened they appeared, like tiny players in an incomprehensible soap opera.And then they left together, and ate, and then went walking down the wide grassy boulevards, eventually coming to his room in the lower town.And she accompanied him inside.Without explanation or comment, in Mayas usual way.As if she always did this.It just happened, was happening.She was in his room, and then in his arms, hugging him.They lay on his bed and she kissed him.The shock of it was such that Frank felt completely removed from his body, his flesh was like rubber.This was beginning to worry him when the sheer animal presence of her broke through the shock, body spoke to body and he suddenly he could feel her again sensation flooded back into him, and he responded to it with animal intensity.It had been a long time.Afterward she walked around with a white sheet draped over her like a cape, getting a glass of water.I like the way you work those people, she said, her back to him.She drank from the glass, looked over her shoulder with her old affectionate grin, with that full and open gaze of hers a gaze that seemed so insightful, like lazed light shining right through him, that suddenly he felt not only naked, but exposed.He pulled the remaining sheet up over his hip, then felt that he had given himself away.Surely she would see, see the way the air turned to cold water in his lungs, the way his stomach knotted, the way his feet froze.He blinked, returned her smile.He knew it was a wan and crooked smile, but feeling his face like a stiff mask over his real flesh he took comfort.No one could accurately read emotions from facial expressions, that was all a lie, a bogus relationship as in palm reading or astrology.So he was safe.But after that night she began spending a lot of time with him, both in public and private.She joined him at the receptions given every night by one or another of the national offices; she sat beside him at many of the group dinners; she sailed the hot sea of conversation with him afterward, as they watched the bad news from Terra, or sat in the close knot of the first hundred.And she went with him to his room at night, or even more disturbing, took him to hers.And all without any sign of what she wanted from him.He could only conclude that she knew she did not have to speak of it.That just being with him was enough, that he would know what she wanted, and try his best to do it without her ever having to say a word.That she would get what she wanted.For of course it was impossible that she was doing it all without cause.That was the nature of power; when you had it no one was ever again simply a friend, simply a lover.Inevitably they all wanted things you could give them if nothing else, the prestige of friendship with the powerful.That was prestige that Maya did not need, but she knew what she wanted.And wasnt he doing it, after all?Infuriating a large part of his power base, to forge a treaty that would please no one but a handful of locals?Yes, she was getting what she wanted.And all without a word, or without a direct word.Nothing but praise and affection.So that as he talked in the endless caucus conferences, carefully hammering out the wording of each clause of the new treaty, playing James Madison to this strange simulacrum of a constitutional convention, Spencer and Samantha and Maya would wander around helping him, and Maya would watch him with the most fractional smile, which revealed to him alone her approval, her pride in him.And then, energized by the days work, he would roam the evening reception, and she would laugh at him and stand at his side and chatter with all the rest, a kind of consort.Hell, a consort!And at night shower him with kisses, until it was impossible to imagine that she did not like him.Which was intolerable.That it should be so easy to deceive even the people who knew you best...that she should be so stupid....It was shocking to realize these things more strongly than ever before.How hidden the true self is, he thought, under the phenomenological mask.In reality they were all actors all the time, playing their video parts, and there was no chance of contact with the true selves inside others, not anymore; over the long years their parts had hardened into shells and the selves inside had atrophied, or wandered off and gotten lost.And now they were all hollow.Or perhaps it was just him.Because she seemed so real!Her laughter, her white hair, her passion, my God: her sweaty skin and the ribs underneath it, ribs that slid back and forth under his fingers like the slats of a fence, ribs that clamped down on the paroxysms of orgasm.A true self, didnt it have to be so?Didnt it?He could hardly believe otherwise.A true self.But sadly deceived.One morning he awoke from a dream of John.It was from their time together on the space station, when they had been young.Except in the dream they had been old, and John had not died and yet he had; he spoke as a ghost, aware that he had died and that Frank had killed him, yet aware also of everything that had happened since, and free of all anger or blame.It was just something that had happened, like the time John had gotten the first landing assignment, or had taken Maya away on the Ares.A lot of things had happened between them one way and another, but they were still friends, still brothers.They could talk, they understood each other.Feeling the horror of that Frank had groaned through the dream, and tried to fold in on himself, and awakened.It was hot, his skin was sweaty.Maya was sitting up, her hair wild, her breasts swinging loosely between her arms.Whats wrong!she was saying.Whats wrong!Nothing!he cried, and got up and padded to the bathroom.But she came after him, put her hands on him.Frank, what was it?Nothing, he shouted, involuntarily jerking out of her grip.Cant you leave me alone!Of course, she said, hurt.A flush of anger: Of course I can.And she walked out of the bathroom.Of course you can!he shouted after her, suddenly furious at her stupidity, to be so ignorant of him, so vulnerable to him, when it was all an act anyway.Now that youve got what you want from me!What does that mean?she said, reappearing instantly in the bathroom doorway, a sheet around her.You know what I mean, he said bitterly.Youve got what you wanted from the treaty, havent you.And you never would have, without me.She stood there, hands on her hips, watching him.The sheet was loose around her hips and she looked like the French figure of Liberty, very beautiful and very dangerous, her mouth a tight line.She shook her head in disgust and walked away.You dont have the faintest idea, do you, she said.He followed her.What do you mean?She threw the sheet away and stepped violently into her underwear, yanked it up over her bottom.As she dressed she hurled short sentences at him.You dont know anything about what other people think.You dont even know what you think.What do you want out of the treaty?You, Frank Chalmers?You dont know.Its only what I want, what Sax wants, what Helmut wants.What any of them want.You yourself have no opinion.Whatever is easiest to manage.Whatever leaves you in control at the end.And as for feelings!She was dressed, standing at the door.She stopped to glare at him, a look like a lightning strike.He had been standing there too stunned to move and so now he stood there naked before her, exposed to the full blast of her scorn.You dont have any feelings, do you.Ive tried, believe me, but you just She shuddered, apparently unable to think of words vile enough to describe him.Hollow, he wanted to say.Empty.An act.And yet  She walked out.So when they signed the new treaty, Maya was not at his side; not even in Burroughs.Which was a relief in many ways, really.And yet he could not help but feel empty, and cold in the chest; and certainly the others of the first hundred (at least) knew something had happened between them (again), which was infuriating, or so he told himself.They signed the thing in the same conference room in which they had hammered it out, with Helmut doing the honors with a big smile, and each delegate coming up in turn, in penguin suit or black evening gown, to say a few words for the cameras and then put their hand to the document, a gesture that only Frank seemed to see as bizarrely archaic, like scratching a petroglyph.Ridiculous.When it was his turn he went up and said something about striking a balance, which was exactly it he had arranged the competing interests to strike together at angles that matched their momentum exactly, arranging a traffic accident so that all the vehicles would collide into a single solidified mass.The result was something not all that dissimilar to the precious version of the treaty, with both emigration and investment, the two main threats to the status quo (if there was such a thing on Mars) mostly blocked, and (this was the clever part) blocked by each other.It was a good piece of work, and he signed with a flourish, For the United States of America, he announced emphatically, glaring around the room intently.That would play well on vid.So he strode through the subsequent parade with the cold satisfaction of work well done.The grass floored tents and walktubes of the city were crowded with thousands of spectators, and the parade wound through them, wandering down the big canalside tent with diversions up into the mesas, coming back down and crossing every canal bridge to cheers, and proceeding up to Princess Park for a great street party.The weather people had set for cool and crisp, with brisk downslope winds.Kites dueled under the tent roofs like raptors, their colors bright against the dark pink afternoon sky.Frank found the party in the park unsettling, there were too many people watching him, too many who wanted to approach him and talk.That was fame: you talked to groups.So he turned around and walked back up the canalside tent.Two parallel rows of white pillars ran down the side of the canal; each pillar was a Bareiss column, semicircular at top and bottom but with the half circles rotated 180 degrees to each other.This simple maneuver created pillars that looked completely different depending on where you were when you looked at them, and the two rows of these pillars had a strange tumbledown look, as if they were already ruins, although the smoothness and whiteness of their diamond coated salt belied that.They stood off the grass as white as sugar cubes, and gleamed as if wet.Frank walked between the rows, touching each pillar in turn.Above them on each side the valley slopes rose to the window walled bluffs of mesas.Massed greenery shone behind these cliffs of untinted glass, so that it looked as if the city were rimmed by enormous terrariums.A really elegant ant farm.The part of the valley slope under tenting was dotted with trees and tile roofs, and cut by broad grassy boulevards.The uncovered part was still a red rocky plain.A great number of buildings were just being finished, or still under construction; there were cranes everywhere rearing up toward the tent roofs, a kind of odd colorful skeletal statuary.Also scores of scaffolded buildings, so that Helmut had said the tented hillsides reminded him of Switzerland, no surprise since most of the construction was being done by Swiss.They scaffold a house to replace a window box.Sax Russell was standing at the foot of one of these scaffolded buildings, looking up at it critically.Frank turned and walked up a tube to him, said hello.Theres twice as much support as they need, Sax said.Maybe more.The Swiss like that.Sax nodded.They stared at the building.Well?Frank said.What do you think?The treaty?It will reduce support for terraforming, Sax said.People are more inclined to invest than to give.Frank scowled.Not all investment is good for terraforming, Sax, you have to remember that.A lot of that money is spent on other things entirely.But terraforming is a way to reduce overhead, you see.A certain percentage of the total investment will always be devoted to it.So I want the total as high as possible.Real benefits can only be calculated using real costs, Frank said.All the real costs.Terran economics never bothered to do that, but youre a scientist and you should.You have to judge the environmental damage from higher population and activity, as well as the benefits to terraforming that go along with it.Better to up the investment devoted to pure terraforming, rather than compromising and taking a percentage of a total that in some ways is working against you.Sax twitched.Its funny to hear you speak against compromise after the last four months, Frank.Anyway, I say its better to up both the total and the percentage.The environmental costs are negligible.Managed right they can mostly be turned to benefits.An economy can be measured in terawatts or kilocalories, like John used to say.And thats energy.And we can use energy here in any form, even a lot of bodies.Bodies are just more work, very versatile, very energetic.Real costs, Sax.All of them.Youre still trying to play at economics, but it isnt like physics, its like politics.Think what will happen when millions of displaced Terran emigrants arrive here, with all their viruses, biological and psychic.Maybe theyll all join Arkady or Ann, ever thought of that?Epidemics, running through the mobs body and mind they could crash your whole system!Look, hasnt the Acheron group been trying to teach you biology?You should pay attention!This isnt mechanics, Sax.Its ecology.And its a fragile, managed ecology, so it has to be managed.Maybe, Sax said.It was one of Johns mannerisms, that phrase.Frank missed what Sax was saying for a minute, then his attention was captured again:   this treaty isnt going to make all that much difference anyway.The transnationals that want to invest will find a way.Theyll make a new flag of convenience and itll look like a country staking its claim here, exactly according to the treatys quotas.But behind it will be transnational money.Therell be all kinds of that stuff happening, Frank.You know how it is.Politics, right?Economics, right?Maybe, Frank said harshly, upset.He walked away.Later he found himself in an upper valley district, still being built.The scaffolding was extreme, as Sax had said, especially for Martian g.  Some of it looked like it would be hard to bring down.He turned and looked out over the valley.The city was nicely placed, that was indisputable.The two sides of the valley meant there was going to be a lot visible from any point.Everywhere in town would have a view.Suddenly his wristpad beeped, and he answered.It was Ann, staring up at him.What do you want, he snapped.I suppose you think I sold you out too.Let in the hordes to overrun your playground.She grimaced.No.You did the best that could be done, given the situation.Thats what I wanted to say.She clicked off and his pad went blank.Great, he said aloud.Ive got everyone on two worlds mad at me except Ann Clayborne.He laughed bitterly, took off walking.Back down to the canal and the rows of Bareiss columns.Lots wives.There were knots of celebrants scattered over the canalside sward, and in the late afternoon light their shadows were long.The sight took on a somehow ominous cast, and Frank turned, uncertain where to go.He didnt like the aftermath of things.Everything seemed finished, done, revealed as pointless.It was always this way.A group of Terrans were standing under one of the more magnificent new office blocks in the Niederdorf tent.There was Andy Jahns among them.If Ann was pleased, Andy would be furious.Frank walked up to him, wanting to witness that.Andy saw him, and his face went still for a moment.Frank Chalmers, he said.What brings you down here?His tone was amiable, but his eyes were unamused, even cold.Yes, he was angry.Frank, feeling better every second, said, Im just walking around, Andy, getting the blood flowing again.What about you?After the briefest of hesitations Jahns said, Were looking at office space.He watched as Frank digested the implications of the statement.His smile took on an edge, became a genuine smile.He went on: These are friends of mine from Ethiopia, from Addis Ababa.Were thinking of moving our home office there next year.And so his smile broadened, no doubt in response to the look on Franks face, which Frank could feel hardening over the front of his skullwe have a lot to discuss.Al Qahira is the name for Mars in Arabic, and Malaysian, and Indonesian.The latter two languages got it from the former; look at a globe, then, and see how far the Arabs religion spread.The whole middle of the world, from West Africa to the West Pacific.And most of that in a single century.Yes, it was an empire in its time; and like all empires, after death it had a long half life.The Arabs who live out of Arabia are called Mahjaris, and the Arabs who came to Mars, the Qahiran Mahjaris.When they arrived on Mars a good number of them began to wander Vastitas Borealis (The Northern Badia) and the Great Escarpment.These wanderers were mostly Bedouin Arabs, and they traveled in caravans, in a deliberate recreation of a life that had disappeared on Earth.People who had lived in cities all their lives went to Mars and moved around in rovers and tents.The excuses for their ceaseless travel included the hunt for metals, areology, and trade, but it seemed clear that the important thing was the travel, the life itself.Frank Chalmers joined old Zeyk Tuqans caravan a month after the treaty was signed, in the northern autumn of M year 15 (July 2057).For a long time he wandered with this caravan over the broken slopes of the Great Escarpment.He worked on his Arabic, and helped with their mining, and took meteorological observations.The caravan was composed of actual Bedouins from Awlad Ali, the coast of Egypt west of the Nile delta.They had lived north of the area that the Egyptian government had named the New Valley Project, after a search for oil discovered a water aquifer holding an amount equal to a thousand years of the Niles flow.Even before the discovery of the gerontological treatment, the Egyptian population problem had been severe; with 96 percent of the country desert, and 99 percent of the population in the Nile Valley, it was inevitable that the hordes relocated in the New Valley Project would overwhelm the Bedouins and their entirely distinct culture.The Bedouins wouldnt even call themselves Egyptians, and despised the Nile Egyptians as spineless and immoral; but that did not keep the Egyptians from crowding north from the New Valley Project into Awlad Ali.Bedouins in the other Arab countries had taken the side of these overwhelmed outposts of their culture, and when the Arab commonwealth started a Mars program, and bought space on the continuous Earth to Mars shuttle fleet, they asked Egypt to give preference to their western Bedouins.The Egyptian government had been only too happy to oblige, and clear the region of its troublesome minority.So here they were, Bedouins on Mars, wandering the world wrapping northern desert.The weather observations piqued Franks interest in climatology like none of the scientists talk ever had.The weather on the escarpment was often violent, with katabatic winds rushing downslope and colliding with the Syrtis trade winds to create tall fast red tornadoes, or onslaughts of gritty hail.Currently the atmosphere was at around 130 millibars in the summer, in a mix about 80 percent carbon dioxide and 10 percent oxygen, the remainder mostly nitrogen from the new nitrite conversion plants.It wasnt clear yet whether they were going to be able to overwhelm the CO2 with oxygen and the other gases, but Sax seemed satisfied with their progress so far.Certainly on a windy day on the escarpment it was clear that the air was thickening; it had some real heft to it, it threw heavy sand, and darkened the afternoons to the color of a scab.And in the hardest gales the gusts could knock you down quite easily.Frank timed one katabatic gust at 600 kilometers an hour; luckily it was part of such a hard general blow that everyone was in the rovers when it happened.The caravan was a mobile mining operation.Metals and ore bearing minerals were being discovered in all kinds of locations and concentrations on Mars, but one thing the Arab prospectors were discovering was that a lot of sulfides were very lightly scattered on the Great Escarpment and the flats immediately below it.Most of these deposits were in concentrations and total quantities that would not justify the use of conventional mining methods, and so the Arabs were engaged in pioneering new extraction and processing procedures; they had built an array of mobile equipment, altering construction vehicles and exploration rovers to suit their purpose.The resulting machines were big, segmented, and distinctly insectile, looking like things out of a truck mechanics nightmare.These creatures wandered the Great Escarpment in loose caravans, seeking the diffuse surface areas of stratiform copper deposits, preferably those with high amounts of tetrahedrite or chalcocite in them, so that they could recover silver as a byproduct of the copper.When they located one of these, they would stop for what they called the harvesting.While they did this, prospector rovers would range ahead along the escarpment, on expeditions of a week or ten days, following the old flows and rifts.When Frank had arrived he had been welcomed by Zeyk, who told him to do whatever work he chose, so Frank commandeered one of the prospector rovers, and took it out on solo expeditions.He would spend a week out, puttering around on automatic search, reading the seismograph and the samplers and the weather instruments, doing an occasional boring, watching the skies.All over both worlds, Bedouin settlements looked drab from the outside.When they abandoned tents, their neighborhoods took on a windowless thick walled look, as if perpetually hunched over to protect themselves from the desert heat.Only when you got inside their homes did one see what was protected, the courtyards, the gardens, the fountains, the birds, the staircases, the mirrors, the arabesques.The Great Escarpment was strange country, cut by north south canyon systems, marred by old craters, overrun by lava flows, broken into hummocks and karsts and mesas and ridges; and all of them on a steep slope, so that on top of any rock or prominence one could see far down to the north.In his days of solitary travel, Frank let the prospector program make most of the decisions, and sat watching the land roll by: silent, stark, huge, torn like the dead past itself.Days would pass, and the shadows wheel.The winds swirled upslope in the mornings, and downslope in the late afternoons.Clouds stacked the sky, from low fog balls bouncing over the rocks to high cirrus shavings, with the occasional thunderhead spanning the whole distance, solid masses of cloud 20,000 meters high.Occasionally he would turn on the TV and watch the Arabic news channel.Sometimes in the silence of the mornings he would talk back to the TV.There was a part of him that was outraged at the stupidity of the media, and of the events they packaged.The stupidity of the human race, playing out its spectacle.Except that the vast bulk of humanity never appeared on video, never once in their lives, not even in the crowd scenes when a camera swept the mob.Back there the Terran past still lived on in enormous regions, where village life was plodding on as it always had.Maybe that was wisdom, held to by old wives and shamans.Maybe.But it was hard to believe, because look what happened when they gathered in cities.Idiots on video, history in the making.One can say that the lengthening of human life must, by definition, be a great boon.These things made him laugh.Havent you ever heard of secondary effects, you asshole!One night he watched a report on the fertilization of the Antarctic Ocean with iron dust, which was to act as a dietary supplement to phytoplankton, a population that was shrinking at an alarming rate for no obvious reason.The iron dust was dumped out of planes, it looked like they were fighting some kind of submarine fire.The project would cost ten billion dollars a year, and would have to be continued in perpetuity, but it had been calculated that a centurys worth of fertilization would reduce the global concentration of carbon dioxide by 15 percent plus or minus 10 percent, and given the ongoing warming and subsequent threat to the coastal cities, not to mention the death of most of the worlds coral reefs, the project had been judged worth it.Anns going to love this, Frank muttered.Now theyre terraforming Earth.Each vocal outburst he made untied a knot in his chest.He came to realize that no one was watching him, no one was listening.The tiny imaginary audience inside his head did not exist; no one watches our life movies.No friend or enemy would ever know what he did here, he could do whatever he liked and normalcy be damned.Apparently this was what he had been craving, what he had instinctively sought.He could go out and kick stones down the side of a karst for a whole afternoon; or cry; or write aphorisms in the sand; or scream abuse at the moons, careening across the southern sky.He could talk back to himself over meals, he could talk back to the TV, he could have conversations with his parents or his lost friends, with the President, or John, or Maya.He could dictate long rambling entries into his lectern: bits of a sociobiological history of the world, a journal, a philosophical treatise, a pornographic novel (he could masturbate), an analysis of the Arab culture and their history.He did all these things, and when he and his prospector rolled back to the caravans, he would feel better: emptier, calmer.More truly hollow.Live, as the Japanese said helpfully, as if you were already dead.But the Japanese were aliens.And living with the Arabs sharpened his sense of how alien they were too.Oh, they were part of twenty first century humanity, no doubt about it; they were sophisticated scientists and technicians, cocooned like everyone else in a protective shell of technology at every moment of their lives, and busy making and watching their own life movies.And yet they prayed three to six times a day, bowing toward Earth when it was the morning or evening star.And the reason their techno caravans gave them such great and obvious pleasure was because the caravans were an outward manifestation of this bending of the modern world to their ancient goals.Mans work is to actualize Gods will in history, Zeyk would say.
