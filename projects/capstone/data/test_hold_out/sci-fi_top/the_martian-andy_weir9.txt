I watched two Phobos transits yesterday and sighted Deneb last night.I worked out my location as accurately as I could, and it wasnt what I wanted to see.As far as I can tell, I hit Marth Crater dead on.Craaaaap.I can go north or south.One of them will probably be better than the other, because itll be a shorter path around the crater.I figured I should put at least a little effort into figuring out which direction was best, so I took a little walk this morning.It was over a kilometer to the peak of the rim.Thats the sort of walk people do on Earth without thinking twice, but in an EVA suit its an ordeal.I cant wait till I have grandchildren.When I was younger, I had to walk to the rim of a crater.Uphill!In an EVA suit!On Mars, ya little shit!Ya hear me?Mars!Anyway, I got up to the rim, and damn, its a beautiful sight.From my high vantage point, I got a stunning panorama.I figured I might be able to see the far side of Marth Crater, and maybe work out the best way around.But I couldnt see the far side.There was a haze in the air.Its not uncommon; Mars has weather and wind and dust, after all.But it seemed hazier than it should.Im accustomed to the wide open expanses of Acidalia Planitia, my former prairie home.Then it got weirder.I turned around and looked back toward the rover and trailer.Everything was where Id left it (very few car thieves on Mars).But the view seemed a lot clearer.I looked east across Marth again.Then west to the horizon.Then east, then west.Each turn required me to rotate my whole body, EVA suits being what they are.Yesterday, I passed a crater.Its about 50 kilometers west of here.Its just visible on the horizon.But looking east, I cant see anywhere near that far.Marth Crater is 110 kilometers wide.With a visibility of 50 kilometers, I should at least be able to see a distinct curvature of the rim.But I cant.At first, I didnt know what to make of it.But the lack of symmetry bothered me.And Ive learned to be suspicious of everything.Thats when a bunch of stuff started to dawn on me:  1.The only explanation for asymmetrical visibility is a dust storm.2.Dust storms reduce the effectiveness of solar cells.3.My solar cells have been slowly losing effectiveness for several sols.From this, I concluded the following:  1.Ive been in a dust storm for several sols.2.Shit.Not only am I in a dust storm, but it gets thicker as I approach Schiaparelli.A few hours ago, I was worried because I had to go around Marth Crater.Now Im going to have to go around something a lot bigger.And I have to hustle.Dust storms move.Sitting still means Ill likely get overwhelmed.But which way do I go?Its no longer an issue of trying to be efficient.If I go the wrong way this time, Ill eat dust and die.I dont have satellite imagery.I have no way of knowing the size or shape of the storm, or its heading.Man, Id give anything for a five minute conversation with NASA.Now that I think of it, NASA must be shitting bricks watching this play out.Im on the clock.I have to figure out how to figure out what I need to know about the storm.And I have to do it now.And right this second nothing comes to mind.*  Mindy trudged to her computer.Todays shift began at 2:10 p. m.  Her schedule matched Watneys every day.She slept when he slept.Watney simply slept at night on Mars, while Mindy had to drift forty minutes forward every day, taping aluminum foil to her windows to get any sleep at all.She brought up the most recent satellite images.She cocked an eyebrow.He had not broken camp yet.Usually he drove in the early morning, as soon as it was light enough to navigate.Then he capitalized on the midday sun to maximize recharging.But today, he had not moved, and it was well past morning.She checked around the rovers and the bedroom for a message.She found it in the usual place (north of the campsite).As she read the Morse code, her eyes widened.DUST STORM.MAKING PLAN.Fumbling with her cell phone, she dialed Venkats personal number.Chapter 23      LOG ENTRY: SOL 476  I think I can work this out.Im on the very edge of a storm.I dont know its size or heading.But its moving, and thats something I can take advantage of.I dont have to wander around exploring it.Itll come to me.The storm is just dust in the air; its not dangerous to the rovers.I can think of it as percent power loss.I checked yesterdays power generation, and it was 97 percent of optimal.So right now, its a 3 percent storm.I need to make progress and I need to regenerate oxygen.Those are my two main goals.I use 20 percent of my overall power to reclaim oxygen (when I stop for Air Days).If I end up in an 81 percent part of the storm, Ill be in real trouble.Ill run out of oxygen even if I dedicate all available power to producing it.Thats the fatal scenario.But really, its fatal much earlier than that.I need power to move or Ill be stranded until the storm passes or dissipates.That could be months.The more power I generate, the more Ill have for movement.With clear skies, I dedicate 80 percent of my total power toward movement.I get 90 kilometers per sol this way.So right now, at 3 percent loss, Im getting 2.7 kilometers less than I should.Its okay to lose some driving distance per sol.I have plenty of time, but I cant let myself get too deep in the storm or Ill never be able to get out.At the very least, I need to travel faster than the storm.If I can go faster, I can maneuver around it without being enveloped.So I need to find out how fast its moving.I can do that by sitting here for a sol.I can compare tomorrows wattage to todays.All I have to do is make sure to compare at the same times of day.Then Ill know how fast the storm is moving, at least in terms of percent power loss.But I need to know the shape of the storm, too.Dust storms are big.They can be thousands of kilometers across.So when I work my way around it, Ill need to know which way to go.Ill want to move perpendicular to the storms movement, and in whatever direction has less storm.So heres my plan:  Right now, I can go 86 kilometers (because I couldnt get a full battery yesterday).Tomorrow, Im going to leave a solar cell here and drive 40 kilometers due south.Then Ill drop off another solar cell and drive another 40 kilometers due south.Thatll give me three points of reference across 80 kilometers.The next day, Ill go back to collect the cells and get the data.By comparing the wattage at the same time of day in those three locations, Ill learn the shape of the storm.If the storm is thicker to the south, Ill go north to get around it.If its thicker north, Ill go south.Im hoping to go south.Schiaparelli is southeast of me.Going north would add a lot of time to my total trip.Theres one slight problem with my plan: I dont have any way to record the wattage from an abandoned solar cell.I can easily track and log wattage with the rover computer, but I need something I can drop off and leave behind.I cant just take readings as I drive along.I need readings at the same time in different places.So Im going to spend today working on some mad science.I have to make something that can log wattage.Something I can leave behind with a single solar cell.Since Im stuck here for the day anyway, Ill leave the solar cells out.I may as well get a full battery out of it.LOG ENTRY: SOL 477  It took all day yesterday and today, but I think Im ready to measure this storm.I needed a way to log the time of day and the wattage of each solar cell.One of the cells would be with me, but the other two would be dropped off and left far away.And the solution was the extra EVA suit I brought along.EVA suits have cameras recording everything they see.Theres one on the right arm (or the left if the astronaut is left handed) and another above the faceplate.A time stamp is burned into the lower left corner of the image, just like on the shaky home videos Dad used to take.My electronics kit has several power meters.So I figured, why make my own logging system?I can just film the power meter all day long.So thats what I set up.When I packed for this road trip, I made sure to bring all my kits and tools.Just in case I had to repair the rover en route.First, I harvested the cameras from my spare EVA suit.I had to be careful; I didnt want to ruin the suit.Its my only spare.I extracted the cameras and the lines leading to their memory chips.I put a power meter into a small sample container, then glued a camera to the underside of the lid.When I sealed up the container, the camera was properly recording the readout of the power meter.For testing, I used rover power.How will my logger get power once I abandon it on the surface?Itll be attached to a two square meter solar cell!Thatll provide plenty of power.And I put a small rechargeable battery in the container to tide it over during nighttime (again, harvested from the spare EVA suit).The next problem was heat, or the lack thereof.As soon as I take this thing out of the rover, itll start cooling down mighty fast.If it gets too cold, the electronics will stop working.So I needed a heat source.And my electronics kit provided the answer: resistors.Lots and lots of them.Resistors heat up.Its what they do.The camera and the power meter only need a tiny fraction of what a solar cell can make.So the rest of the energy goes through resistors.I made and tested two power loggers and confirmed that the images were being properly recorded.Then I had an EVA.I detached two of my solar cells and hooked them up to the power loggers.I let them log happily for an hour, then brought them back in to check the results.They worked great.Its getting toward nightfall now.Tomorrow morning, Ill leave one power logger behind and head south.While I was working, I left the oxygenator going (why not?).So Im all stocked up on O2 and good to go.The solar cell efficiency for today was 92.5 percent.Compared to yesterdays 97 percent.This proves the storm is moving east to west, because the denser part of the storm was to the east yesterday.So right now, the sunlight in this area is dropping by 4.5 percent per sol.If I were to stay here another sixteen sols, it would get dark enough to kill me.Just as well Im not going to stay here.LOG ENTRY: SOL 478  Everything went as planned today.No hiccups.I cant tell if Im driving deeper into the storm or out of it.Its hard to tell if the ambient light is less or more than it was yesterday.The human brain works hard to abstract that out.I left a power logger behind when I started out.Then, after 40 kilometers travel due south, I had a quick EVA to set up another.Now Ive gone the full 80 kilometers, set up my solar cells for charging, and Im logging the wattage.Tomorrow, Ill have to reverse course and pick up the power loggers.It may be dangerous; Ill be driving right back into a known storm area.But the risk is worth the gain.Also, have I mentioned Im sick of potatoes?Because, by God, I am sick of potatoes.If I ever return to Earth, Im going to buy a nice little home in Western Australia.Because Western Australia is on the opposite side of Earth from Idaho.I bring it up because I dined on a meal pack today.I had saved five packs for special occasions.I ate the first of them twenty nine sols ago when I left for Schiaparelli, but I totally forgot to eat the second when I reached the halfway point a few sols ago.So Im enjoying my belated halfway feast.Its probably more accurate to eat it today anyway.Who knows how long itll take me to go around this storm?And if I end up stuck in the storm and doomed to die, Im totally eating the other earmarked meals.LOG ENTRY: SOL 479  Have you ever taken the wrong freeway entrance?You just need to drive to the next exit to turn around, but you hate every inch of travel because youre going away from your goal.I felt like that all day.Im now back where I started yesterday morning.Yuk.Along the way, I picked up the power logger Id left behind at the halfway point.Just now I brought in the one Id left here yesterday.Both loggers worked the way Id hoped.I downloaded each of their video recordings to a laptop and advanced them to noon.Finally I had solar efficiency readings from three locations along an 80 kilometer line, all from the same time of day.As of noon yesterday, the northernmost logger showed 12.3 percent efficiency loss, the middle one had a 9.5 percent loss, and the rover recorded a 6.4 percent loss at its southernmost location.It paints a pretty clear picture: The storms north of me.And I already worked out its traveling west.So I should be able to avoid it by heading south a ways, letting it pass me to the north, then heading east again.Finally, some good news!Southeast is what I wanted.I wont lose much time.Sigh I have to drive the same god damned path a third time tomorrow.LOG ENTRY: SOL 480  I think Im getting ahead of the storm.Having traveled along Mars Highway 1 all day, Im back at my campsite from yesterday.Tomorrow, Ill finally make real headway again.I was done driving and had the camp set up by noon.The efficiency loss here is 15.6 percent.Compared to the 17 percent loss at yesterdays camp, this means I can outrun the storm as long as I keep heading south.Hopefully.The storm is probably circular.They usually are.But I could just be driving into an alcove.If thats the case, Im just fucking dead, okay?Theres only so much I can do.Ill know soon enough.If the storm is circular, I should get better and better efficiency every day until Im back to 100 percent.Once I reach 100 percent, that means Im completely south of the storm and I can start going east again.Well see.If there were no storm, Id be going directly southeast toward my goal.As it is, going only south, Im not nearly as fast.Im traveling 90 kilometers per day as usual, but I only get 37 kilometers closer to Schiaparelli because Pythagoras is a dick.I dont know when Ill finally clear the storm and be able to beeline to Schiaparelli again.But one things for sure: My plan to arrive on Sol 494 is boned.Sol 549.Thats when they come for me.If I miss it, Ill spend the rest of my very short life here.And I still have the MAV to modify before then, too.Sheesh.LOG ENTRY: SOL 482  Air Day.A time for relaxation and speculation.For relaxation, I read eighty pages of Agatha Christies Evil Under the Sun courtesy of Johanssens digital book collection.I think Linda Marshall is the murderer.As for speculation, I speculated on when the hell Ill get past this storm.Im still going due south every day; and still dealing with efficiency loss (though Im keeping ahead of it).Every day of this crap Im only getting 37 kilometers closer to the MAV instead of 90.Pissing me off.I considered skipping the Air Day.I could go another couple of days before I ran out of oxygen, and getting away from the storm is pretty important.But I decided against it.Im far enough ahead of the storm that I can afford one day of no movement.And I dont know if a couple more days would help.Who knows how far south the storm goes?Well, NASA probably knows.And the news stations back on Earth are probably showing it.And theres probably a website like www.watch mark watney die.com.So theres like a hundred million people or so who know exactly how far south it goes.But Im not one of them.LOG ENTRY: SOL 484  Finally!I am FINALLY past the god damned storm.Todays power regen was 100 percent.No more dust in the air.With the storm moving perpendicular to my direction of travel, it means Im south of the southernmost point of the cloud (presuming its a circular storm.If its not, then fuck).Starting tomorrow, I can go directly toward Schiaparelli.Which is good, cause I lost a lot of time.I went 540 kilometers due south while avoiding that storm.Im catastrophically off course.Mind you, it hasnt been that bad.Im well into Terra Meridiani now, and the driving is a little easier here than the rugged, ass kicking terrain of Arabia Terra.Schiaparelli is almost due east, and if my sextant and Phobos calculations are correct, Ive got another 1030 kilometers to get there.Accounting for Air Days and presuming 90 kilometers of travel per sol, I should arrive on Sol 498.Not too bad, really.The Nearly Mark Killin storm only ended up delaying me by four sols.Ill still have forty four sols to do whatever MAV modifications NASA has in mind.LOG ENTRY: SOL 487  I have an interesting opportunity here.And by opportunity I mean Opportunity.I got pushed so far off course, Im actually not far from the Mars exploration rover Opportunity.Its about 300 kilometers away.I could get there in about four sols.Damn its tempting.If I could get Opportunitys radio working, Id be in touch with humanity again.NASA would continually tell me my exact position and best course, warn me if another storm was on its way, and generally be there watching over me.But if Im being honest, thats not the real reason Im interested.Im sick of being on my own, damn it!Once I got Pathfinder working, I got used to talking to Earth.All that went away because I leaned a drill against the wrong table, and now Im alone again.I could end that in just four sols.But its an irrational, stupid thought.Im only eleven sols away from the MAV.Why go out of my way to dig up another broken ass rover to use as a makeshift radio when Ill have a brand new, fully functional communications system within a couple of weeks?So, while its really tempting that Im within striking range of another rover (man, we really littered this planet with them, didnt we?), its not the smart move.Besides, Ive defiled enough future historical sites for now.LOG ENTRY: SOL 492  I need to put some thought into the bedroom.Right now, I can only have it set up when Im inside the rover.It attaches to the airlock, so I cant get out if its there.During my road trip that doesnt matter, because I have to furl it every day anyway.But once I get to the MAV, I wont have to drive around anymore.Each decompress/recompress of the bedroom stresses the seams (I learned that lesson the hard way when the Hab blew up), so its best if I can find a way to leave it out.Holy shit.I just realized I actually believe Ill get to the MAV.See what I did there?I casually talked about what Ill do after I get to the MAV.Like it was nothing.No big deal.Im just going to pop over to Schiaparelli and hang with the MAV there.Nice.Anyway, I dont have another airlock.Ive got one on the rover and one on the trailer and thats it.Theyre firmly fixed in place, so its not like I can detach one and attach it to the bedroom.But I can seal the bedroom entirely.I dont even have to do any hatchet jobs on it.The airlock attachment point has a flap I can unroll and seal the opening with.Remember, I stole the airlock attachment from a pop tent, which is an emergency feature for pressure loss while in the rover.Itd be pretty useless if it couldnt seal itself off.Unfortunately, as an emergency device, it was never intended to be reusable.The idea was that people seal themselves in the pop tent, then the rest of the crew drives to wherever they are in the other rover and rescues them.The crew of the good rover detaches the pop tent from the breached rover and reattaches it to theirs.Then they cut through the seal from their side to recover their crewmates.To make sure this would always be an option, mission rules dictated no more than three people could be in a rover at once, and both rovers had to be fully functional or we couldnt use either.So heres my brilliant plan: I wont use the bedroom as a bedroom anymore once I get to the MAV.Ill use it to house the oxygenator and atmospheric regulator.Then Ill use the trailer as my bedroom.Neat, eh?The trailer has tons of space.I put a shitload of work into making that happen.The balloon gives plenty of headroom.Not a lot of floor space, but still lots of vertical area.Also, the bedroom has several valve apertures in its canvas.I have the Habs design to thank for that.The canvas I stole from it has valve apertures (triple redundant ones, actually).NASA wanted to make sure the Hab could be refilled from the outside if necessary.In the end, Ill have the bedroom sealed with the oxygenator and atmospheric regulator inside.Itll be attached to the trailer via hoses to share the same atmosphere, and Ill run a power line through one of the hoses.The rover will serve as storage (because I wont need to get to the driving controls anymore), and the trailer will be completely empty.Then Ill have a permanent bedroom.Ill even be able to use it as a workshop for whatever MAV modifications I need to do on parts that can fit through the trailers airlock.Of course, if the atmospheric regulator or oxygenator have problems, Ill need to cut into the bedroom to get to them.But Ive been here 492 sols and theyve worked fine the whole time, so Ill take that risk.LOG ENTRY: SOL 497  Ill be at the entrance to Schiaparelli tomorrow!Presuming nothing goes wrong, that is.But hey, everything else has gone smoothly this mission, right?(That was sarcasm. )Todays an Air Day, and for once, I dont want it.Im so close to Schiaparelli, I can taste it.I guess it would taste like sand, mostly, but thats not the point.Of course, that wont be the end of the trip.Itll take another three sols to get from the entrance to the MAV, but hot damn!Im almost there!I think I can even see the rim of Schiaparelli.Its way the hell off in the distance and it might just be my imagination.Its 62 kilometers away, so if Im seeing it, Im only just barely seeing it.Tomorrow, once I get to Entrance Crater, Ill turn south and enter the Schiaparelli Basin via the Entrance Ramp.I did some back of the napkin math, and the slope should be pretty safe.The elevation change from the rim to the basin is 1.5 kilometers, and the ramp is at least 45 kilometers long.That makes for a two degree grade.No problem.Tomorrow night, Ill sink to an all new low!Lemme rephrase that  Tomorrow night, Ill be at rock bottom!No, that doesnt sound good either  Tomorrow night, Ill be in Giovanni Schiaparellis favorite hole!Okay, I admit Im just playing around now.*  For millions of years, the rim of the crater had been under constant attack from wind.It eroded the rocky crest the way a river cuts through a mountain range.After eons, it finally breached the edge.The high pressure zone created by the wind now had an avenue to drain.The breach widened more and more with each passing millennium.As it widened, dust and sand particles carried along with the attack settled in the basin below.Eventually, a balance point was reached.The sand had piled up high enough to be flush with the land outside the crater.It no longer built upward but outward.The slope lengthened until a new balance point was reached, one defined by the complex interactions of countless tiny particles and their ability to maintain an angled shape.Entrance Ramp had been born.The weather brought dunes and desert terrain.Nearby crater impacts brought rocks and boulders.The shape became uneven.Gravity did its work.The ramp compressed over time.But it did not compress evenly.Differing densities shrunk at different rates.Some areas became hard as rock while others remained as soft as talc.While providing a small average slope into the crater, the ramp itself was rugged and bitterly uneven.On reaching Entrance Crater, the lone inhabitant of Mars turned his vehicle toward the Schiaparelli Basin.The difficult terrain of the ramp was unexpected, but it looked no worse than other terrain he routinely navigated.He went around the smaller dunes and carefully crested the larger ones.He took care with every turn, every rise or fall in elevation, and every boulder in his path.He thought through every course and considered all alternatives.But it wasnt enough.The rover, while descending down a seemingly ordinary slope, drove off an invisible ridge.The dense, hard soil suddenly gave way to soft powder.With the entire surface covered by at least five centimeters of dust, there were no visual hints to the sudden change.The rovers left front wheel sank.The sudden tilt brought the right rear wheel completely off the ground.This in turn put more weight on the left rear wheel, which slipped from its precarious purchase into the powder as well.Before the traveler could react, the rover rolled onto its side.As it did, the solar cells neatly stacked on the roof flew off and scattered like a dropped deck of cards.The trailer, attached to the rover with a tow clamp, was dragged along.The torsion on the clamp snapped the strong composite like a brittle twig.The hoses connecting the two vehicles also snapped.The trailer plunged headlong into the soft soil and flipped over on to its balloon roof, shuddering to an abrupt halt.The rover was not so lucky.It continued tumbling down the hill, bouncing the traveler around like clothes in a dryer.After twenty meters, the soft powder gave way to more solid sand and the rover shuddered to a halt.It had come to rest on its side.The valves leading to the now  missing hoses had detected the sudden pressure drop and closed.The pressure seal was not breached.The traveler was alive, for now.Chapter 24   The department heads stared at the satellite image on the projection screen.Jesus, Mitch said.What the hell happened?The rovers on its side, Mindy said, pointing to the screen.The trailers upside down.Those rectangles scattered around are solar cells.Venkat put a hand on his chin.Do we have any information on the state of the rover pressure vessel?Nothing obvious, Mindy said.Any signs of Watney doing something after the accident?An EVA maybe?No EVA, Mindy said.The weathers clear.If hed come out, thered be visible footsteps.Is this the entire crash site?Bruce Ng asked.I think so, Mindy said.Up toward the top of the photo, which is north, there are ordinary wheel tracks.Right here, she pointed to a large disturbance in the soil, is where I think things went wrong.Judging by where that ditch is, Id say the rover rolled and slid from there.You can see the trench it left behind.The trailer flipped forward onto its roof.Im not saying everythings okay, Bruce said, but I dont think its as bad as it looks.Go on, Venkat said.The rovers designed to handle a roll, Bruce explained.And if thered been pressure loss, thered be a starburst pattern in the sand.I dont see anything like that.Watney may still be hurt inside, Mitch said.He could have banged his head or broken an arm or something.Sure, Bruce said.Im just saying the rover is probably okay.When was this taken?Mindy checked her watch.We got it seventeen minutes ago.Well get another pic in nine minutes when MGS4s orbit brings it into view.First thing hell do is an EVA to assess damage, Venkat said.Mindy, keep us posted on any changes.LOG ENTRY: SOL 498  Hmm.Yeah.Things didnt go well on the descent into Schiaparelli Basin.To give you some indication of how unwell they went, Im reaching up to the computer to type this.Because its still mounted near the control panel, and the rover is on its side.I got bounced around a lot, but Im a well honed machine in times of crisis.As soon as the rover toppled, I curled into a ball and cowered.Thats the kind of action hero I am.It worked, too.Cause Im not hurt.The pressure vessel is intact, so thats a plus.The valves that lead to the trailer hoses are shut.Probably means the hoses disconnected.And that means the trailer junction snapped.Wonderful.Looking around the interior here, I dont think anything is broken.The water tanks stayed sealed.There arent any visible leaks in the air tanks.The bedroom came unfolded, and its all over the place, but its just canvas, so it cant have gotten too hurt.The driving controls are okay, and the nav computer is telling me the rover is at an unacceptably dangerous tilt.Thanks, Nav!So I rolled.Thats not the end of the world.Im alive and the rovers fine.Im more worried about the solar cells I probably rolled over.Also, since the trailer detached, theres a good chance its fucked up, too.The balloon roof it has isnt exactly durable.If it popped, the shit inside will have been flung out in all directions and Ill have to go find it.Thats my critical life support.Speaking of life support, the rover switched over to the local tanks when the valves shut.Good boy, Rover!Heres a Scooby Snack.Ive got twenty liters of oxygen (enough to keep me breathing for forty days), but without the regulator (which is in the trailer) Im back to chemical CO2 absorption.I have 312 hours of filters left.Plus I have another 171 hours of EVA suit CO2 filters as well.All told, that gives me 483 hours, which is close to twenty sols.So I have time to get things working again.Im really damn close to the MAV now.About 220 kilometers.Im not going to let something like this stop me from getting there.And I dont need everything to work at top form anymore.I just need the rover to work for 220 more kilometers and the life support to work for fifty one more sols.Thats it.Time to suit up and look for the trailer.LOG ENTRY: SOL 498 (2)  I had an EVA and things arent too bad.Mind you, theyre not good.I trashed three solar cells.Theyre under the rover and cracked all to hell.They might still be able to piss out a few watts, but Im not holding out much hope.Luckily, I did come into this with one extra solar cell.I needed twenty eight for my daily operations and I brought twenty nine (fourteen on the rovers roof, seven on the trailers roof, and eight on the makeshift shelves I installed on the sides of both vehicles).I tried pushing the rover over, but I wasnt strong enough.Ill need to rig something to get a leverage advantage.Other than being on its side, I dont see any real problems.Well, thats not true.The tow hook is ruined beyond repair.Half of it ripped clean off.Fortunately, the trailer also has a tow hook, so I have a spare.The trailers in a precarious situation.Its upside down and sitting on the inflated roof.Im not sure which god smiled down on me and kept that balloon from popping, but Im grateful.My first priority will be righting it.The longer it puts weight on that balloon, the larger the chances itll pop.While I was out, I collected the twenty six solar cells that arent under the rover and set them up to recharge my batteries.May as well, right?So right now, I have a few problems to tackle: First, I need to right the trailer.Or at least get the weight off the balloon.Next, I need to right the rover.Finally, I need to replace the rovers tow hook with the one on the trailer.Also, I should spell out a message for NASA.Theyre probably worried.*  Mindy read the Morse code aloud.ROLLED.FIXING NOW.What?Thats it?Venkat said over the phone.Thats all he said, she reported, cradling the phone as she typed out an e mail to the list of interested parties.Just three words?Nothing about his physical health?His equipment?His supplies?You got me, she said.He left a detailed status report.I just decided to lie for no reason.Funny, Venkat said.Be a smart ass to a guy seven levels above you at your company.See how that works out.Oh no, Mindy said.I might lose my job as an interplanetary voyeur?I guess Id have to use my masters degree for something else.I remember when you were shy.Im space paparazzi now.The attitude comes with the job.Yeah, yeah, Venkat said.Just send the e mail.Already sent.LOG ENTRY: SOL 499  I had a busy day today, and I got a lot done.I started out pretty sore.I had to sleep on the wall of the rover.The bedroom wont work when the airlock is facing up.I did get to use the bedroom, somewhat.I folded it up and used it as a bed.Anyway, suffice it to say, the wall of the rover wasnt made for sleeping on.But after a morning potato and Vicodin, I was feeling much better.At first I figured my top priority was the trailer.Then I changed my mind.After taking a good look at it, I decided Id never be able to right it by myself.Id need the rover.So today was focused on getting the rover righted.I brought all my tools along on this trip, figuring Id need them for the MAV modifications.And along with them I brought cabling.Once I get set up at the MAV, my solar cells and batteries will be in a fixed position.I dont want to move the rover around every time I use a drill on the far side of the MAV.So I brought all the electrical cabling I could fit.Good thing, too.Because it doubles as rope.I dug up my longest cable.Its the same one I used to power the drill that destroyed Pathfinder.I call it my lucky cable.I plugged one end into the battery and the other into the infamous sample drill, then walked off with the drill to find solid ground.Once I found it, I kept going until Id gone as far as the electrical line would reach.I drove a one meter bit half a meter into a rock, unplugged the power line, and tied it around the base of the bit.Then I went back to the rover and tied off the cord to the roof rack bar on the high side.Now I had a long, taut line running perpendicular to the rover.I walked to the middle of the cord and pulled it laterally.The leverage advantage on the rover was huge.I only hoped it wouldnt break the drill bit before it tipped the rover.I backed away, pulling the line more and more.Something had to give, and it wasnt going to be me.I had Archimedes on my side.The rover finally tipped.It fell onto its wheels, kicking up a large cloud of soft dust.It was a silent affair.I was far enough away that the thin atmosphere had no hope of carrying the sound to me.I untied the power line, liberated the drill bit, and returned to the rover.I gave it a full systems check.Thats a boring as hell task, but I had to do it.Every system and subsystem was working correctly.JPL did a damn good job making these rovers.If I get back to Earth, Im buying Bruce Ng a beer.Though I guess I should buy all the JPL guys a beer.Beers for everyone if I get back to Earth.Anyway, with the rover back on its wheels it was time to work on the trailer.Problem is, I ran out of daylight.Remember, Im in a crater.I had gotten most of the way down the Ramp when I rolled the rover.And the Ramp is up against the western edge of the crater.So the sun sets really early from my point of view.Im in the shadow of the western wall.And that royally sucks.Mars is not Earth.It doesnt have a thick atmosphere to bend light and carry particles that reflect light around corners.Its damn near a vacuum here.Once the sun isnt visible, Im in the dark.Phobos gives me some moonlight, but not enough to work with.Deimos is a little piece of crap thats no good to anyone.I hate to leave the trailer sitting on its balloon for another night, but theres not much else I can do.I figure its survived a whole day like that.Its probably stable for now.And hey, with the rover righted, I get to use the bedroom again!Its the simple things in life that matter.LOG ENTRY: SOL 500  When I woke up this morning, the trailer hadnt popped yet.So that was a good start.The trailer was a bigger challenge than the rover.I only had to tip the rover.Id need to completely flip the trailer.That requires a lot more force than yesterdays little leverage trick.The first step was to drive the rover to near the trailer.Then came the digging.Oh God, the digging.The trailer was upside down, with its nose pointed downhill.I decided the best way to right it was to take advantage of the slope and roll the trailer over its nose.Basically to make it do a somersault to land on its wheels.I can make this happen by tying off the cable to the rear of the trailer and towing with the rover.But if I tried that without digging a hole first, the trailer would just slide along the ground.I needed it to tip up.I needed a hole for the nose to fall into.So I dug a hole.A hole one meter across, three meters wide, and one meter deep.It took me four miserable hours of hard labor, but I got it done.I hopped in the rover and drove it downhill, dragging the trailer with me.As Id hoped, the trailer nosed into the hole and tipped up.From there, it fell onto its wheels with a huge plume of dust.Then I sat for a moment, dumbstruck that my plan had actually worked.And now Im out of daylight again.I cant wait to get out of this damn shadow.All I need is one day of driving toward the MAV and Ill be away from the wall.But for now its another early night.Ill spend tonight without the trailer to manage my life support.It may be righted, but I have no idea if the shit inside still works.The rover still has ample supplies for me.Ill spend the rest of the evening enjoying a potato.And by enjoying I mean hating so much I want to kill people.LOG ENTRY: SOL 501  I started the day with some nothin tea.Nothin tea is easy to make.First, get some hot water, then add nothin.I experimented with potato skin tea a few weeks ago.The less said about that the better.I ventured into the trailer today.Not an easy task.Its pretty cramped in there; I had to leave my EVA suit in the airlock.The first thing I noticed was that it was really hot inside.It took me a few minutes to work out why.The atmospheric regulator was still in perfect working order, but it had nothing to do.Without being connected to the rover, it no longer had my CO2 production to deal with.The atmosphere in the trailer was perfectwhy change anything?With no regulation necessary, the air was not being pumped out to the AREC for freeze separation.And thus it wasnt coming back in as a liquid in need of heating.But remember, the RTG gives off heat all the time.You cant stop it.So the heat just built up.Eventually, things reached a balance point where the heat bled through the hull as fast as the RTG could add it.If youre curious, that balance point was a sweltering 41C.I did a full diagnostic on the regulator and the oxygenator, and Im happy to report both are working perfectly.The RTGs water tank was empty, which is no surprise.It has an open top, not intended to be turned upside down.The floor of the trailer has a lot of puddled water that took me quite a while to sop up with my jumpsuit.I topped the tank off with some more water from a sealed container that Id stored in the trailer earlier.Remember, I need that water to have something for the returning air to bubble through.Thats my heating system.But all things considered, it was good news.The critical components are working fine, and both vehicles are back on their wheels.The hoses that connected the rover and trailer were designed well, and released without breaking.I simply snapped them back into place and the vehicles were sharing life support again.The one remaining thing to fix was the tow hook.It was absolutely ruined.It took the full force of the crash.But as I suspected, the trailers tow hook was unscathed.So I transferred it to the rover and reconnected the two vehicles for travel.All told, that little fender bender cost me four sols.But now Im back in action!Sort of.What if I run into another powder pit?I got lucky this time.Next time I might not get off so easy.I need a way to know if the ground in front of me is safe.At least for the duration of my time on the Ramp.Once Im in the Schiaparelli Basin proper, I can count on the normal sandy terrain Im used to.If I could have anything, it would be a radio to ask NASA the safe path down the Ramp.Well, if I could have anything, it would be for the green skinned yet beautiful Queen of Mars to rescue me so she can learn more about this Earth thing called lovemaking.Its been a long time since Ive seen a woman.Just sayin.Anyway, to ensure I dont crash again, IllSeriously no women in like, years.I dont ask for much.Believe me, even back on Earth a botanist/mechanical engineer doesnt exactly have ladies lined up at the door.But still, cmon.Anyway.Ill drive slower.Like a crawl.That should give me enough time to react if one wheel starts to sink.Also, the lower speed will give me more torque, making it less likely Ill lose traction.Up till now Ive been driving 25 kph, so Im going to cut that to 5 kph.Im still toward the top of the Ramp, but the whole thing is only 45 kilometers.I can take my time and get safely to the bottom in about eight hours.Ill do it tomorrow.Im already out of daylight again today.Thats another bonus: Once I clear the ramp, I can start beelining toward the MAV, which will take me away from the crater wall.Ill be back to enjoying the entire days sunlight instead of just half of it.If I get back to Earth, Ill be famous, right?A fearless astronaut who beat all the odds, right?I bet women like that.More motivation to stay alive.*  So, it looks like hes fixed everything, Mindy explained.And his message today was ALL BETTER NOW, so I guess hes got everything working.She surveyed the smiling faces in the meeting room.Awesome, Mitch said.Great news.Bruces voice came in through the speakerphone.Venkat leaned forward to the phone.How are the MAV modification plans coming, Bruce?Is JPL going to have that procedure soon?Were working around the clock on it, Bruce said.Were past most of the big hurdles.Working out the details now.Good, good, Venkat said.Any surprises I should know about?Um Bruce said.Yeah, a few.This might not be the best venue for it.Ill be back in Houston with the procedure in a day or two.We can go through it then.Ominous, Venkat said.But okay, well pick it up later.Can I spread the word?Annie asked.Itd be nice to see something other than the rover crash site on the news tonight.Definitely, Venkat said.Itll be nice to have some good news for a change.Mindy, how long until he gets to the MAV?At his usual rate of 90 kilometers per sol, Mindy said, he should get there on Sol 504.Sol 505 if he takes his time.He always drives in the early morning, finishing around noon.She checked an application on her laptop.Noon on Sol 504 will be 11:41 a. m.  this Wednesday here in Houston.Noon on Sol 505 will be 12:21 p. m.  on Thursday.Mitch, whos handling Ares 4 MAV communications?The Ares 3 Mission Control team, Mitch replied.Itll be in Control Room 2.I assume youll be there?Bet your ass Ill be there.So will I.       LOG ENTRY: SOL 502  Every Thanksgiving, my family used to drive from Chicago to Sandusky, an eight hour drive.Its where Moms sister lived.Dad always drove, and he was the slowest, most cautious driver who ever took the wheel.Seriously.He drove like he was taking a drivers test.Never exceeded the speed limit, always had his hands at ten and two, adjusted mirrors before each outing, you name it.It was infuriating.Wed be on the freeway, cars blowing by left and right.Some of them would blare their horns because, honestly, driving the speed limit makes you a road hazard.I wanted to get out and push.I felt that way all damn day today.Five kph is literally a walking pace.And I drove that speed for eight hours.But the slow speed ensured that I wouldnt fall into any more powder pits along the way.And of course I didnt encounter any.I could have driven full speed and had no problems.But better safe than sorry.The good news is Im off the Ramp.I camped out as soon as the terrain flattened out.Ive already overdone my driving time for the day.I could go further, I still have 15 percent battery power or so, but I want to get as much daylight on my solar cells as I can.Im in the Schiaparelli Basin at last!Far from the crater wall, too.I get a full day of sunlight every day from now on.I decided it was time for a very special occasion.I ate the meal pack labeled Survived Something That Should Have Killed Me.Oh my god, I forgot how good real food tastes.With luck, Ill get to eat Arrival in a few sols.LOG ENTRY: SOL 503  I didnt get as much recharge as I usually would yesterday.Because of my extended driving time, I only got up to 70 percent before night fell.So todays driving was abbreviated.I got 63 kilometers before I had to camp out again.But I dont even mind.Because Im only 148 kilometers from the MAV.That means Ill get there the sol after tomorrow.Holy hell, Im really going to make it!LOG ENTRY: SOL 504  Holy shit, this is awesome!Holy shit!Holy shit!Okay calm.Calm.I made 90 kilometers today.By my estimate, Im 50 kilometers from the MAV.I should get there sometime tomorrow.Im excited about that, but heres what Im really stoked about: I caught a blip from the MAV!NASA has the MAV broadcasting the Ares 3 Hab homing signal.Why wouldnt they?It makes perfect sense.The MAV is a sleek, perfectly functional machine, ready to do what its told.And they have it pretending to be the Ares 3 Hab, so my rover will see the signal and tell me where it is.That is an exceptionally good idea!I wont have to wander around looking for the thing.Im going straight to it.I only caught a blip.Ill get more as I get closer.Its strange to think that a sand dune will stop me from hearing what the MAV has to say when it can talk to Earth no problem.The MAV has three redundant methods of communicating with Earth, but theyre all extremely directed and are designed for line of sight communication.And there arent any sand dunes between it and Earth when they talk.Somehow they messed with things to make a radial signal, however weak it may be.And I heard it!My message for the day was GOT BEACON SIGNAL.If Id had enough rocks, I would have added, AWESOME IDEA!!!But its a really sandy area.*  The MAV waited in southwestern Schiaparelli.It stood an impressive twenty seven meters tall, its conical body gleaming in the midday sun.The rover crested a nearby dune with the trailer in tow.It slowed for a few moments, then continued toward the ship at top speed.It came to a stop twenty meters away.There it remained for ten minutes while the astronaut inside suited up.He stumbled excitedly out of the airlock, falling to the ground then scrambling to his feet.Beholding the MAV, he gestured to it with both arms, as if in disbelief.He leaped into the air several times, arms held high with fists clenched.Then he knelt on one knee and fist pumped repeatedly.Running to the spacecraft, he hugged Landing Strut B.  After a few moments, he broke off the embrace to perform another round of leaping celebrations.Now fatigued, the astronaut stood with arms akimbo, looking up at the sleek lines of the engineering marvel before him.Climbing the ladder on the landing stage, he reached the ascent stage and entered the airlock.He sealed the door behind him.Chapter 25      LOG ENTRY: SOL 505  I finally made it!Im at the MAV!Well, right this second, Im back in the rover.I did go into the MAV to do a systems check and boot up.I had to keep my EVA suit on the whole time because theres no life support in there just yet.Its going through a self check right now, and Im feeding it oxygen and nitrogen with hoses from the rover.This is all part of the MAVs design.It doesnt bring air along.Why would it?Thats a needless weight when youll have a Hab full of air right next door.Im guessing folks at NASA are popping champagne right now and sending me lots of messages.Ill read them in a bit.First things first: Get the MAV some life support.Then Ill be able to work inside comfortably.And then Ill have a boring conversation with NASA.Well, the content may be interesting, but the fourteen minute transmission time between here and Earth will be a bit dull.*  [13:07] HOUSTON: Congratulations from all of us here at Mission Control!Well done!Whats your status?[13:21] MAV: Thanks!No health or physical problems.The rover and trailer are getting pretty worn out, but still functional.Oxygenator and regulator both working fine.I didnt bring the water reclaimer.Just brought the water.Plenty of potatoes left.Im good to last till 549.[13:36] HOUSTON: Glad to hear it.Hermes is still on track for a Sol 549 flyby.As you know, the MAV will need to lose some weight to make the intercept.Were going to get you those procedures within the day.How much water do you have?What did you do with urine?[13:50] MAV: I have 550 liters of remaining water.Ive been dumping urine outside along the way.[14:05] HOUSTON: Preserve all water.Dont do any more urine dumps.Store it somewhere.Turn the rovers radio on and leave it on.We can contact it through the MAV.*  Bruce trudged into Venkats office and unceremoniously plopped down in a chair.He dropped his briefcase and let his arms hang limp.Have a good flight?Venkat asked.I only have a passing memory of what sleep is, Bruce said.So is it ready?Venkat asked.Yes, its ready.But youre not going to like it.Go on.Bruce steeled himself and stood, picking up his briefcase.He pulled a booklet from it.Bear in mind, this is the end result of thousands of hours of work, testing, and lateral thinking by all the best guys at JPL.Im sure it was hard to trim down a ship thats already designed to be as light as possible, Venkat said.Bruce slid the booklet across the desk to Venkat.The problem is the intercept velocity.The MAV is designed to get to low Mars orbit, which only requires 4.1 kps.But the Hermes flyby will be at 5.8 kps.Venkat flipped through the pages.Care to summarize?First, were going to add fuel.The MAV makes its own fuel from the Martian atmosphere, but its limited by how much hydrogen it has.It brought enough to make 19,397 kilograms of fuel, as it was designed to do.If we can give it more hydrogen, it can make more.How much more?For every kilogram of hydrogen, it can make thirteen kilograms of fuel.Watney has five hundred and fifty liters of water.Well have him electrolyze it to get sixty kilograms of hydrogen.Bruce reached over the desk and flipped a few pages, pointing to a diagram.The fuel plant can make seven hundred and eighty kilograms of fuel from that.If he electrolyzes his water, whatll he drink?He only needs fifty liters for the time he has left.And a human body only borrows water.Well have him electrolyze his urine, too.We need all the hydrogen we can get our hands on.I see.And what does seven hundred and eighty kilograms of fuel buy us?Venkat asked.It buys us 300 kilograms of payload.Its all about fuel versus payload.The MAVs launch weight is over 12,600 kilograms.Even with the bonus fuel, well need to get that down to 7,300 kilograms.So the rest of this booklet is how to remove over 5,000 kilograms from the ship.Venkat leaned back.Walk me through it.Bruce pulled another copy of the booklet from his briefcase.There were some gimmes right off the bat.The design presumes five hundred kilograms of Martian soil and rock samples.Obviously we wont do that.Also, theres just one passenger instead of six.That saves five hundred kilograms when you consider their weight plus their suits and gear.And we can lose the other five acceleration chairs.And of course, well remove all nonessential gearthe med kit, tool kit, internal harnessing, straps, and anything else that isnt nailed down.And some stuff that is.Next up, he continued, Were ditching all life support.The tanks, pumps, heaters, air lines, CO2 absorption system, even the insulation on the inner side of the hull.We dont need it.Well have Watney wear his EVA suit for the whole trip.Wont that make it awkward for him to use the controls?Venkat asked.He wont be using them, Bruce said.Major Martinez will pilot the MAV remotely from Hermes.Its already designed for remote piloting.It was remotely landed, after all.What if something goes wrong?Venkat asked.Martinez is the best trained pilot, Bruce said.If there is an emergency, hes the guy you want controlling the ship.Hmm, Venkat said cautiously.Weve never had a manned ship controlled remotely before.But okay, go on.Since Watney wont be flying the ship, Bruce continued, he wont need the controls.Well ditch the control panels and all the power and data lines that lead to them.Wow, Venkat said.Were really gutting this thing.Im just getting started, Bruce said.The power needs will be dramatically reduced now that life support is gone, so well dump three of the five batteries and the auxiliary power system.The orbital maneuvering system has three redundant thrusters.Well get rid of those.Also, the secondary and tertiary comm systems can go.Wait, what?Venkat said, shocked.Youre going to have a remote controlled ascent with no backup comm systems?No point, Bruce said.If the comm system goes out during ascent, the time it takes to reacquire will be too long to do any good.The backups dont help us.This is getting really risky, Bruce.Bruce sighed.I know.Theres just no other way.And Im not even to the nasty stuff yet.Venkat rubbed his forehead.By all means, tell me the nasty stuff.Well remove the nose airlock, the windows, and Hull Panel Nineteen.Venkat blinked.Youre taking the front of the ship off?Sure, Bruce said.The nose airlock alone is four hundred kilograms.The windows are pretty damn heavy, too.And theyre connected by Hull Panel Nineteen, so may as well take that, too.So hes going to launch with a big hole in the front of the ship?Well have him cover it with Hab canvas.Hab canvas?For a launch to orbit!?Bruce shrugged.The hulls mostly there to keep the air in.Marss atmosphere is so thin you dont need a lot of streamlining.By the time the ships going fast enough for air resistance to matter, itll be high enough that theres practically no air.Weve run all the simulations.Should be good.Youre sending him to space under a tarp.Pretty much, yeah.Like a hastily loaded pickup truck.Yeah.Can I go on?Sure, cant wait.Well also have him remove the back panel of the pressure vessel.Its the only other panel he can remove with the tools on hand.Also, were getting rid of the auxiliary fuel pump.Sad to see it go, but it weighs too much for its usefulness.And were nixing a Stage One engine.An engine?Yeah.The Stage One booster works fine if one engine goes out.Itll save us a huge amount of weight.Only during the Stage One ascent, but still.Pretty good fuel savings.Bruce fell silent.That it?Venkat asked.Yeah.Venkat sighed.Youve removed most of the safety backups.Whats this do to the estimated odds of failure?Its about four percent.Jesus Christ, Venkat said.Normally wed never even consider something that risky.Its all weve got, Venk, Bruce said.Weve tested it all out and run simulations galore.We should be okay if everything works the way its supposed to.Yeah.Great, Venkat said.*  [08:41] MAV: You fucking kidding me?[09:55] HOUSTON: Admittedly, they are very invasive modifications, but they have to be done.The procedure doc we sent has instructions for carrying out each of these steps with tools you have on hand.Also, youll need to start electrolyzing water to get the hydrogen for the fuel plant.Well send you procedures for that shortly.[09:09] MAV: Youre sending me into space in a convertible.[09:24] HOUSTON: There will be Hab canvas covering the holes.It will provide enough aerodynamics in Marss atmosphere.[09:38] MAV: So its a ragtop.Much better.LOG ENTRY: SOL 506  On the way here, in my copious free time, I designed a workshop.I figured Id need space to work on stuff without having to wear an EVA suit.I devised a brilliant plan whereby the current bedroom would become the new home of the regulator and the oxygenator, and the now empty trailer would become my workshop.Its a stupid idea, and Im not doing it.All I need is a pressurized area that I can work in.I somehow convinced myself that the bedroom wasnt an option because its a hassle to get stuff into it.But it wont be that bad.It attaches to the rover airlock, so the getting stuff in is going to be annoying.Bring the stuff into the rover, attach the bedroom to the airlock from the inside, inflate it, bring the stuff into the bedroom.Ill also have to empty the bedroom of all tools and equipment to fold it up any time I need to do an EVA.So yeah, itll be annoying, but all it costs me is time.And Im actually doing well on that front.I have forty three more sols before Hermes flies by.And looking at the procedure NASA has in mind for the modifications, I can take advantage of the MAV itself as a workspace.The lunatics at NASA have me doing all kinds of rape to the MAV, but I dont have to open the hull till the end.So the first thing Ill do is clear out a bunch of clutter, like chairs and control panels and the like.Once theyre out, Ill have a lot of room in there to work.But I didnt do anything to the soon to be mutilated MAV today.Today was all about system checks.Now that Im back in contact with NASA, I have to go back to being all safety first.Strangely, NASA doesnt have total faith in my kludged together rover or my method of piling everything into the trailer.They had me do a full systems check on every single component.Everythings still working fine, though its wearing down.The regulator and the oxygenator are at less than peak efficiency (to say the least), and the trailer leaks some air every day.Not enough to cause problems, but its not a perfect seal.NASAs pretty uncomfortable with it, but we dont have any other options.Then, they had me run a full diagnostic on the MAV.Thats in much better shape.Everythings sleek and pristine and perfectly functional.Id almost forgotten what new hardware even looks like.Pity Im going to tear it apart.*  You killed Watney, Lewis said.Yeah, Martinez said, scowling at his monitor.The words Collision with Terrain blinked accusingly.I pulled a nasty trick on him, Johanssen said.I gave him a malfunctioning altitude readout and made Engine Three cut out too early.Its a deadly combination.Shouldnt have been a mission failure, Martinez said.I should have noticed the readout was wrong.It was way off.Dont sweat it, Lewis said.Thats why we drill.Aye, Commander, Martinez said.He furrowed his brow and frowned at the screen.Lewis waited for him to snap out of it.When he didnt, she put a hand on his shoulder.Dont beat yourself up, she said.They only gave you two days of remote launch training.It was only supposed to happen if we aborted before landing; a cut our losses scenario where wed launch the MAV to act as a satellite.It wasnt mission critical so they didnt drill you too hard on it.Now that Marks life depends on it, youve got three weeks to get it right, and I have no doubt you can do it.Aye, Commander, Martinez said, softening his scowl.Resetting the sim, Johanssen said.Anything specific you want to try?Surprise me, Martinez said.Lewis left the control room and made her way to the reactor.As she climbed up the ladder to the center of the ship, the centripetal force on her diminished to zero.Vogel looked up from a computer console.Commander?How are the engines?she asked, grabbing a wall mounted handle to stay attached to the slowly turning room.
