Suri burst in the back door, her hand covered in loose black soil and a wide grin on her face.Her footsteps left crumbling dark marks on the carpet.Nani!Nani!Look what I found!Avasarala shifted in her chair.In her granddaughters palm, an earthworm was shifting the pink and brown rings of its body, wet as the soil that dripped from Suris fingers.Avasarala made her face into a mask of wonder and delight.Thats wonderful, Suri.Come back outside and show your nani where you found that.The yard smelled like cut grass and fresh soil.The gardener a thin man hardly older than her own son would have been knelt in the back, pulling weeds by hand.Suri pelted out toward him, and Avasarala moved along after her at a stroll.When she came near, the gardener nodded, but there was no space for conversation.Suri was pointing and gesturing and retelling the grand adventure of finding a common worm in the mud as if it were a thing of epics.Kiki appeared at Avasaralas side, quietly taking her hand.She loved her little Suri, but privately or if not that, then only to Arjun she thought Kiki was the smarter of her grandchildren.Quiet, but the girls black eyes were bright, and she could mimic anyone she heard.Kiki didnt miss much.Darling wife, Arjun called from the back door.Theres someone to talk with you.Where?The house system, Arjun said.She says your terminals not answering.Theres a reason for that, Avasarala said.Its Gloria Tannenbaum.Avasarala reluctantly handed Kikis hand over to the nurse, kissed Suris head, and went back toward the house.Arjun held the door open for her.His expression was apologetic.These cunts are digging into my grandma time, she said.The price of power, Arjun replied with a solemnity that was amused and serious at the same time.Avasarala opened the connection on the system in her private office.There was a click and a moments dislocation while the privacy screens came up, and then Gloria Tannenbaums thin, eye browless face appeared on her screen.Gloria!Im sorry.I had my terminal down with the children over.Not a problem, the woman said with a clean, brittle smile that was as close as she came to a genuine emotion.Probably for the best anyway.Always assume those are being monitored more closely than civilian lines.Avasarala lowered herself into her chair.The leather breathed out gently under her weight.I hope things are all right with you and Etsepan?Fine, Gloria said.Good, good.Now why the fuck are you calling me?I was talking to a friend of mine whose wife is stationed on the Mikhaylov.From what he says, its being pulled off patrol.Going deep.Avasarala frowned.The Mikhaylov was part of a small convoy monitoring the traffic between the deep stations orbiting at the far edge of the Belt.Going deep where?I asked around, Gloria said.Ganymede.Nguyen?Yes.Your friend has loose lips, Avasarala said.I never tell him anything true, Gloria said.I thought you should know.I owe you, Avasarala said.Gloria nodded once, the movement sharp as a crows, and dropped the connection.Avasarala sat in silence for a long moment, fingers pressed to her lips, mind following the chains of implication like a brook flowing over stones.Nguyen was sending more ships to Ganymede, and he was doing it quietly.The why quietly part was simple.If hed done it openly, she would have stopped him.Nguyen was young and he was ambitious, but he wasnt stupid.He was drawing conclusions of his own, and somehow hed gotten to the idea that sending more forces into the open sore that was Ganymede Station would make things better.Oh, Nani!Kiki called.From the lilt of her voice, Avasarala knew there was mischief afoot.She hefted herself up from the desk and headed for the door.In here, Kiki, she said, stepping out into the kitchen.The water balloon hit her in the shoulder without bursting, bobbled down to the floor, and popped at her feet, turning the stone tiles around her dark.Avasarala looked up, rage faced.Kiki stood in the doorway leading to the yard, caught between fear and delight.Did you just make a mess in my house?Avasarala asked.Pale faced, the girl nodded.Do you know what happens to bad children who make a mess in their nanis house?Do they get tickled?They get tickled!Avasarala said, and bolted for her.Of course Kiki got away.She was a child of eight.The only time the girls joints ached, it was from growing too fast.And of course, eventually she let her nani catch her and tickle her until she screamed.By the time Ashanti and her husband came to gather up their children for the flight back to Novgorod, Avasarala had grass stains on her sari and her hair was standing off her scalp in all directions, like the cartoon image of her lightning struck self.She hugged the children twice before they left, sneaking bits of chocolate to them each time, then kissed her daughter, nodded to her son in law, and waved to them all from her doorway.The security team followed their car.No one so closely related to her was safe from kidnapping.It was just another fact of life.Her shower was long, using a lavish volume of water almost too hot for comfort.Shed always liked her baths to approach scalding, ever since she was a girl.If her skin didnt tingle and throb a little when she toweled off, shed done it wrong.Arjun was on the bed, reading seriously from his hand terminal.She walked to her closet, threw the wet towel into the hamper, and shrugged into a cotton weave robe.He thinks they did it, she said.Who did what?Arjun asked.Nguyen.Hes thinking that the Martians are behind the thing.That theres going to be a second attack on Ganymede.He knows the Martians arent moving their fleet there, and hes still reinforcing.He doesnt care if it fucks the peace talks, because he thinks theyre crap anyway.Nothing to lose.Are you listening to me?Yes, I am.Nguyen thinks it was Mars.Hes building a fleet to respond.You see?Do you know what Im talking about?As a rule?No.But Maxwell Asinnian Koh just posted a paper about post lyricism thats going to get him no end of hate mail.Avasarala chuckled.You live in your own world, dear one.I do, Arjun agreed, running his thumb across the hand terminals screen.He looked up.You dont mind, do you?I love you for it.Stay here.Read about post lyricism.What are you going to do?The same thing as always.Try to keep civilization from blowing up while the children are in it.When shed been young, her mother had tried to teach her knitting.The skill hadnt taken, but there were other lessons that had.Once, the skein of yarn had gotten knotted badly, and Avasaralas frustrated yanking had only made things progressively worse.Her mother had taken the tight bound clump from her, but instead of fixing it herself and handing it back, her mother sat cross legged on the floor beside her and spoke aloud about how to solve the knot.Shed been gentle, deliberate, and patient, looking for places where she could work more slack into the system until, seemingly all at once, the yarn spilled free.There were ten ships in the list, ranging from an ancient transport past due for the scrap heap to a pair of frigates captained by people whose names shed heard.It wasnt a huge force, but it was enough to be provocative.Gently, deliberately, patiently, Avasarala started plucking it apart.The transport was first, because it was easiest.Shed been cultivating the boys in maintenance and safety for years.It took four hours for someone with the schematics and logs to find a bolt that hadnt been replaced on schedule, and less than half an hour after that to issue the mandatory recall.The Wu Tsao  better armed of the frigates was captained by Golla Ishigawa Marx.His service record was solid, workmanlike reading.He was competent, unimaginative, and loyal.Three conversations had him promoted to the head of the construction oversight committee, where he probably wouldnt do any harm.The full command crew of the Wu Tsao was requested to come back to Earth to be present when they pinned a ribbon on him.The second frigate was harder, but she found a way.And by then the convoy was small enough that the medical and support ship was a higher rating than the remaining convoy justified.The knot unspooled in her fingers.The three ships she couldnt pry loose were old and underpowered.If it came to a fight, they wouldnt be significant.And because of that, the Martians would only take offense if they were looking for an excuse.She didnt think they would.And if she was wrong, that would be interesting too.Wont Admiral Nguyen see through all this?Errinwright asked.He was in a hotel room somewhere on the other side of the planet.It was night behind him, and his dress shirt was unbuttoned at the top.Let him, Avasarala said.Whats he going to do?Go crying to his mama that I took his toys away?If he cant play with the big kids, he shouldnt be a fucking admiral.Errinwright smiled and cracked his knuckles.He looked tired.The ships that will get there?The Bernadette Koe, the Aristophanes, and the Feodorovna, sir.Those, yes.What are you going to tell the Martians about them?Nothing if they dont bring it up, Avasarala said.If they do, I can dismiss them.A minor medical support ship, a transport, and an itty bitty gunship to keep off pirates.I mean, its not like were sending a couple of cruisers.So fuck them.Youll say it more gently, I hope?Of course I will, sir.Im not stupid.And Venus?She took a long breath, letting the air hiss out between her teeth.Its the damn bogeyman, she said.Im getting daily reports, but we dont know what were looking at.The network it built across the planetary surface is finished, and now its breaking down, but there are structures coming up in a complex radial symmetry.Only its not along the axis of rotation.Its on the plane of ecliptic.So whatevers down there, its orienting itself with the whole solar system in mind.And the spectrographic analysis is showing an uptick in lanthanum oxide and gold.I dont know what that means.Neither does anyone else, but the brains are thinking it may be a set of very high temperature superconductors.Theyre trying to replicate the crystal structures in the labs, and theyve found some things they dont understand.Turns out, the thing down theres a better physical chemist than we are.No fucking surprise there.Any link to Ganymede?Just the one, Avasarala said.Otherwise nothing.Or at least not directly.What do you mean, not directly?Avasarala frowned and looked away.The Buddha looked back.Did you know that the number of religious suicide cults has doubled since Eros?she said.I didnt until I got the report.The bond initiative to rebuild the water reclamation center at Cairo almost failed last year because a millennialist group said we wouldnt need it.Errinwright sat forward.His eyes were narrow.You think theres a connection?I dont think theres a bunch of pod people sneaking up from Venus, she said, butIve been thinking about what its done to us.The whole solar system.Them and us and the Belters.Its not healthy having God sleeping right there where we can all watch him dream.It scares the shit out of us.It scares the shit out of me.And so we all look away and go about things as if the universe were the same as when we were young, but we know better.Were all acting like were sane, but  She shook her head.Humanitys always lived with the inexplicable, Errinwright said.His voice was hard.She was making him uncomfortable.Well, she was making herself uncomfortable too.The inexplicable didnt used to eat planets, she said.Even if the thing on Ganymede didnt come up off Venus on its own, its pretty damn clear that its related.And if we did it   If we built that, its because we found a new technology, and were using it, Errinwright said.Flint spear to gunpowder to nuclear warheads, its what we do, Chrisjen.Let me worry about that.You keep your eye on Venus and dont let the Martian situation get out of control.Yes, sir, she said.Everythings going to be fine.And, looking at the dead screen where her superior had been, Avasarala decided that maybe he even thought it was true.Avasarala wasnt sure any longer.Something was bothering her, and she didnt yet know what it was.It only lurked there, just underneath her conscious mind, like a splinter in a fingertip.She opened the captured video from the UN outpost on Ganymede, went through the mandatory security check, and watched the Marines die again.Kiki and Suri were going to grow up in a world where this had happened, where Venus had always been the colony of something utterly foreign, uncommunicative, and implacable.The fear that carried would be normal to them, something they didnt think about any more than they did their own breath.On her screen, a man no older than Soren emptied an assault rifle clip into the attacker.The enhanced images showed the dozens of impacts cutting through the thing, the trails of filament coming out its back like streamers.The soldier died again.At least it had been quick for him.She paused the image.Her fingertip traced the outline of the attacker.Who are you?she asked the screen.What do you want?She was missing something.It happened often enough that she knew the feeling, but that didnt help.It would come when it came.All she could do until it did was keep scratching where it itched.She shut down the files, waiting for the security protocols to make sure she hadnt copied anything, then signed out and turned to the window.She found that she was thinking about the next time.What information theyd be able to get the next time.What kind of patterns shed be able to glean from the next time.The next attack, the next slaughter.It was already perfectly clear in her mind that what had happened on Ganymede was going to happen again, sooner or later.Genies didnt get put back into bottles, and from the moment the protomolecule had been set loose on the civilian population of Eros just to see what it would do, civilization had changed.Changed so fast and so powerfully that they were still playing catch up.Playing catch up.There was something there.Something in the words, like a lyric from a song she almost remembered.She ground her teeth and stood up, pacing the length of her window.She hated this part.Hated it.Her office door opened.When she turned to look at Soren, he flinched back.Avasarala took her scowl down a couple of notches.It wasnt fair to scare the poor bunny.He was probably just the intern whod pulled the short straw and gotten stuck with the cranky old woman.And in a way, she liked him.Yes?she said.I thought youd want to know that Admiral Nguyen sent a note of protest to Mr.Errinwright.Interference in his field of command.He didnt copy the secretary general.Avasarala smiled.If she couldnt unlock all the mysteries of the universe, she could at least keep the boys in line.And if he wasnt appealing to the bobble head, then it was just pouting.Nothing was going to come of it.Good to know.And the Martians?Theyre here, maam.She sighed, plucked at her sari, and lifted her chin.Lets go stop the war, then, she said.Thirteen: Holden  Amos, whod finally turned up a few hours after the food riot carrying a case of beer and saying hed done some recon, was now carrying a small case of canned food.The label claimed it was chicken food products.Holden hoped that the hacker Prax was leading them to would see the offering as at least being in the spirit of his requested payment.Prax led the way with the manic speed of someone who had one last thing to do before he died, and could feel the end close on his heels.Holden suspected this wasnt far from the truth.The small botanist certainly looked like hed been burning himself up.Theyd taken him aboard the Somnambulist while theyd gathered the supplies theyd need, and Holden had forced the man to eat a meal and take a shower.Prax had begun stripping while Holden was still showing him how to use the ships head, as if waiting for privacy would waste precious time.The sight of the mans ravaged body had shocked him.All the while, the botanist spoke only of Mei, of his need to find her.Holden realized that hed never in his life needed anything as badly as this man needed to see his daughter again.To his surprise, it made him sad.Prax had been robbed of everything, had all his fat boiled away; hed been rendered down to the bare minimum of humanity.All he had left was his need to find his little girl, and Holden envied him for it.When Holden had been dying and trapped in the hell of Eros Station, he had discovered that he needed to see Naomi one last time.Or barring that, to see that she was safe.It was why he hadnt died there.That and having Miller at his side with a second gun.And that connection, even now that he and Naomi were lovers, was a pale shadow compared to the thing driving Prax.It left Holden feeling like hed lost something important without realizing it.While Prax had showered, Holden had gone up the ladder to ops, where Naomi had been working to hack her way into Ganymedes crippled security system, pulled her out of her chair, and held her for a few moments.She stiffened with surprise for a second, then relaxed into his embrace.Hi, she whispered in his ear.It might be a pale shadow, but it was what he had right now, and it was pretty damn good.Prax paused at an intersection, his hands tapping at his thighs as if he were hurrying himself along.Naomi was back on the ship, monitoring their progress through locators they all carried and with the remnants of the stations security cameras.At Holdens back, Amos cleared his throat and said in a voice low enough that Prax wouldnt hear, If we lose this guy, I dont like our chances of finding our way back too quick.Holden nodded.Amos was right.Even at the best of times, Ganymede was a maze of identical gray corridors and occasional parklike caverns.And the station certainly wasnt at her best now.Most of the public information kiosks were dark, malfunctioning, or outright destroyed.The pubnet was unreliable at best.And the local citizens moved like scavengers over the corpse of their once great moon, alternately terrified and threatening.He and Amos were both openly wearing firearms, and Amos had mastered a sort of constant glower that made people automatically put him onto their not to be fucked with list.Not for the first time, Holden wondered what sort of life Amos had been leading prior to his signing up for a tour on the Canterbury, the old water hauler theyd served together on.Prax came to a sudden halt in front of a door that looked like a hundred other doors theyd already passed, set into the wall of a gray corridor that looked like every other gray corridor.This is it.Hes in here.Before Holden could respond, Prax was hammering on the door.Holden took a step back and to the side, giving himself a clear view of the doorway past Prax.Amos stepped to the other side, tucking the case of chicken under his left arm and hooking his right thumb into his waistband just in front of the holster.A year of patrolling the Belt, cleaning up the worst jackals that the governmental vacuum had left behind, had instilled some automatic habits in his crew.Holden appreciated them, but he wasnt sure he liked them.Working security certainly hadnt made Millers life any better.The door was yanked open by a scrawny and shirtless teenager with a big knife in his other hand.The fuck  he started, then stopped when he saw Holden and Amos flanking Prax.He glanced at their guns and said, Oh.Ive brought you chicken, Prax replied, pointing back at the case Amos carried.I need to see the rest of the camera footage.Coulda got that for you, Naomi said in Holdens ear, given enough time.Its the enough time part thats a problem, Holden subvocalized back at her.But thats definitely plan B.   The skinny teen shrugged and opened the door the rest of the way, gesturing for Prax to enter.Holden followed, with Amos bringing up the rear.So, the kid said.Show it, sabe?Amos put down the case on a filthy table and removed a single can from the box.He held it up where the kid could see it.Sauce?the kid said.How about a second can instead?Holden replied, moving over to the kid and smiling up at him agreeably.So go get the rest of the footage, and well get out of your hair.Sound good?The kid lifted his chin and pushed Holden an arms length back.Dont push up on me, macho.My apologies, Holden said, his smile never wavering.Now go get the damned video footage you promised my friend here.Maybe no, the kid said.He flapped one hand at Holden.Adinerado, si no?Quizas you got more than chicken to pay.Maybe a lot.Let me get this straight, Holden replied.Are you shaking us down?Because that would be   A meaty hand came down on his shoulder, cutting him off.I got this one, Cap, Amos said, stepping between Holden and the kid.He held one of the chicken cans in his hand, and he was tossing it lightly and catching it.That guy, Amos said, pointing at Prax with his left hand while continuing to toss the chicken with his right, got his baby girl snatched.He just wants to know where she is.Hes willing to pay the agreed upon price for that information.The kid shrugged and started to speak, but Amos held up a finger to his lips and shushed him.And now, when that price is ready to be paid, Amos said, his tone friendly and conversational, you want to shake him down because you know hes desperate.Hell give anything to get his girl back.This is a fat payday, right?The kid shrugged again.Que no   Amos smashed the can of chicken food product into the kids face so fast that for a moment Holden couldnt figure out why the hacker was suddenly lying on the ground, blood gushing from his nose.Amos settled one knee onto his chest, pinning him to the floor.The can of chicken went up and then pistoned down into the kids face again with a sharp crack.He started to howl, but Amos clamped his left hand over the boys mouth.You piece of shit, Amos yelled, all the friendliness gone from his voice, leaving just a ragged animal rage that Holden had never heard there before.You gonna hold a baby girl hostage for more fucking chicken?Amos smashed the can into the hackers ear, which immediately bloomed red.His hand came away from the kids mouth, and the boy started yelling for help.Amos raised the can of chicken one more time, but Holden grabbed his arm and pulled him up off the gibbering kid.Enough, he said, holding on to Amos and hoping the big man didnt decide to clobber him with the can instead.Amos had always been the kind of guy who got into bar fights because he enjoyed them.This was something different.Enough, Holden said again, and then held on until Amos stopped struggling.He cant help us if you bash his brains out.The kid scooted backward across the floor and had his shoulders up against the wall.He nodded as Holden spoke, and held his bleeding nose between his finger and thumb.That right?Amos said.You going to help?The kid nodded again and scrambled to his feet, still pressed against the wall.Ill go with him, Holden said, patting Amos on the shoulder.Why dont you stay here and take a breather.Before Amos could answer, Holden pointed at the terrified hacker.Better get to work.There, Prax said when the video of Meis abduction came up again.Thats Mei.That man is her doctor, Dr.Strickland.That woman, I dont know her.But Meis teacher said that she came up in their records as Meis mother.With a picture and authorization to pick her up.Security is very good at the school.Theyd never let a child go without that.Find where they went, Holden said to the hacker.To Prax he said, Why her doctor?Mei is Prax started, then stopped and started over.Mei has a rare genetic disease that disables her immune system without regular treatments.Dr.Strickland knows this.Sixteen other kids with her disorder are missing too.He could keep them he could keep Mei alive.You getting this, Naomi?Yep, riding the hackers trail through security.We wont need him again.Good, Holden said.Because Im pretty sure this bridge is thoroughly burned once we walk out the door.We always have more chicken, Naomi said with a chuckle.Amos made sure the kids next request will be for plastic surgery.Ouch, she replied.He okay?Holden knew she meant Amos.Yeah.But is there something I dont know about him that would make this problematic?Because hes really   Aqui, the hacker said, pointing at his screen.Holden watched as Dr.Strickland carried Mei down an older looking corridor, the dark haired woman in tow.They came to a door that looked like an ancient pressure hatch.Strickland did something at the panel next to it, and the three of them went inside.No eyes past this, the hacker said, almost flinching as if in expectation of being punished for the failings of the Ganymede security system.Naomi, where does that go?Holden said, patting the air to let the hacker know he wasnt to blame.Looks like an old part of the original dig, she said, her words punctuated by pauses as she worked her console.Zoned for utility storage.Shouldnt be anything beyond that door but dust and ice.Can you get us there?Holden asked.Naomi and Prax both said, Yes, at the same time.Then thats where were going.He gestured for Prax and the hacker to lead the way back out to the front room, then followed them.Amos was sitting at the table, spinning one of the chicken cans on its edge like a thick coin.In the light gravity of the moon, it seemed like it would keep spinning forever.His expression was distant and unreadable.You did the job, Holden said to the hacker, who was staring at Amos, his face twitching from fear to rage and back again.So youll get paid.We arent going to stiff you.Before the kid could reply, Amos stood up and picked up the case of canned chicken.He turned it over and dumped all the remaining cans on the floor, where a few rolled away to various corners of the small room.Keep the change, asshole, he said, then threw the empty box into the tiny kitchen nook.And with that, Holden said, well take our leave.After Amos and Prax had gone out the door, Holden backed out, keeping a watchful eye on the hacker to make sure there were no misguided attempts at revenge.He shouldnt have worried.The minute Amos was out the door, the kid just started picking up the chicken cans and stacking them on the table.As he backed out and closed the door behind him, Naomi said, You know what it means, dont you?Which thing?he replied, then said to Amos, Back to the ship.Prax said all the kids with Meis particular disorder were missing, Naomi continued.And her doctor is the one who took her out of school.So we can probably assume he, or people working with him, took the others, Holden agreed.Amos and Prax were walking together up the corridor, the big man still wearing his distant look.Prax put a hand on his arm, and Holden heard him whisper, Thank you.Amos just shrugged.Why would he want those kids?Naomi asked.The better question to me is, how did he know to take them just hours before the shooting started?Yeah, Naomi said, her voice quiet.Yeah, how did he know that?Because hes the reason why things went pear shaped, Holden replied, saying out loud what they were both thinking.If hes got all of those kids, and he or the people hes with were able to start a shooting war between Mars and Earth to cover up the snatch  Starts to feel like a strategy weve seen before, doesnt it?We need to know whats on the other side of that door.One of two things, Naomi said.Nothing, because after the snatch they got the hell off this moon  Or, Holden continued, a whole lot of guys with guns.Yeah.The galley of the Somnambulist was quiet as Prax and Holdens crew watched the video again.Naomi had pieced together all the security footage of Meis abduction into a single long loop.They watched as her doctor carried her through various corridors, up a lift, and finally to the door of the abandoned parts of the station.After the third viewing, Holden gestured for Naomi to turn it off.What do we know?he said, his fingers drumming on the table.The kids not scared.Shes not fighting to get away, Amos said.Shes known Dr.Strickland all her life, Prax replied.He would be almost like family to her.Which means they bought him, Naomi said.Or this plan has been going on for  Four years, Prax said.Four years, Naomi repeated.Which is a hell of a long con to run unless the stakes are huge.Is it kidnapping?If they want a ransom payment  Doesnt wash.A couple hours after Mei disappears into that hatch, Holden said, pointing at the image frozen on Naomis screen, Earth and Mars are shooting each other.Somebodys going to a lot of trouble to grab sixteen sick kids and hide the fact they did it.If Protogen wasnt toast, Amos said, Id say this is exactly the kind of shit theyd pull.And whoever it is has significant tech resources too, Naomi said.They were able to hack the schools system even before the Ganymede netsec was collapsing from the battle, and insert that womans records into Meis file without any trace of tampering.Some of the kids in her school had very rich or powerful parents, Prax said.Their security would have to be top notch.Holden drummed out a last rhythm on the tabletop with both hands, then said, Which all leads us back to the big question.Whats waiting for us on the other side of that door?Corporate goons, Amos said.Nothing, Naomi said.Mei, Prax said quietly.It might be Mei.We need to be prepared for all three possibilities: violence, gathering clues, or rescuing a kid.So lets put together a plan.Naomi, I want a terminal with a radio link that I can plug into whatever network we find on the other side, and give you a doorway in.Yep, Naomi said, already getting up from the table and heading toward the keel ladder.Prax, you need to come up with a way for Mei to trust us if we find her, and give us details on any complications her illness might cause during a rescue.How quickly do we need to get her back here for her meds?Things like that.Okay, Prax said, pulling out his terminal and making notes.Amos?Yeah, Cap?That leaves violence to us.Lets tool up.The smile began and ended at the corners of Amos eyes.Fuck yeah.Fourteen: Prax  Prax didnt understand how near he was to collapse until he ate.Canned chicken with some kind of spicy chutney, soft no crumb crackers of the type usually used in zero g environments, a tall glass of beer.He wolfed it down, his body suddenly ravenous and unstoppable.After he finished vomiting, the woman who seemed to take care of all the small practical matters on the ship he knew her name was Naomi, but he kept wanting to call her Cassandra, because she looked like an intern by that name hed worked with three years earlier switched him to a thin protein broth that his atrophied gut could actually handle.Over the course of hours, his mind started coming back.It felt like waking up over and over without falling asleep in between; sitting in the hold of Holdens ship, hed find himself noticing the shift in his cognition, how much more clearly he could think and how good it felt to come back to himself.And then a few minutes later, some set of sugar deprived ganglia would struggle back to function, and it would all happen again.And with every step back toward real consciousness, he felt the drive growing, pushing him toward the door that Strickland and Mei had gone through.Doctor, huh?the big one Amos  said.I got my degree here.The universitys really good.Lots of grant money.Or now I suppose there used to be.I was never much for formal education myself.The relief ships mess hall was tiny and scarred by age.The woven carbon filament walls had cracks in the enameling, and the tabletop was pitted from years, maybe decades, of use.The lighting was a thin spectrum shifted toward pink that would have killed any plants living under it in about three days.Amos had a canvas sack filled with formed plastic boxes of different sizes, each of which seemed to have a firearm of some kind inside.He had unrolled a square of red felt and disassembled a huge matte black pistol on it.The delicate metal parts looked like sculpture.Amos dipped a cotton swab into a bright blue cleaning solution and rubbed it gently on a silver mechanism attached to a black metal tube, polishing metal plates that were already bright as a mirror.Prax found his hands moving toward the disassembled pieces, willing them to come together.To be already cleaned and polished and remade.Amos pretended not to notice in a way that meant he was very much aware.I dont know why they would have taken her, Prax said.Dr.Strickland has always been great with her.He never I mean, hed never hurt her.I dont think hed hurt her.Yeah, probably not, Amos said.He dipped the swab into the cleaning fluid again and started on a metal rod with a spring wrapped around it.I really need to get there, Prax said.He didnt say, Every minute here is a minute that they could be hurting Mei.That she could be dying or getting shipped offworld.He tried to keep his words from sounding like a whine or a demand, but they seemed to come out as both.Getting readys the shitty part, Amos said, as if agreeing to something.You want to get right out into it right the fuck now.Get it over with.Well, yes, Prax said.I get that, Amos said.Its no fun, but youve got to get through it.Going in without your gear ready, you might as well not go.Plus which the girls been gone for how long now?Since the fighting.Since the mirror came down.Chances of another hour making much difference are pretty small, right?But   Yeah, Amos said with a sigh.I know.This is the tough part.Not as bad as waiting for us to get back, though.Thats gonna suck even worse.Amos put down the swab and started fitting the long black spring back over the spindle of bright metal.The alcohol fumes of the cleaning solution stung Praxs eyes.Im waiting for you, Prax said.Yeah, I know, Amos said.And Ill make sure were real quick about it.The captains a real good guy, but he can get kind of distracted sometimes.Ill keep him on point.No trouble.No, Prax said, I dont mean Im waiting for you when you go to that door.I mean Im waiting for you right now.Im waiting to go there with you.Amos slid the spring and spindle into the shell of the gun, twisting it gently with his fingertips.Prax didnt know when hed risen to his feet.How many gunfights have you been in?Amos asked.His voice was low and wide and gentle.Because Ive been in shit.Thisll be eleven for me.Maybe twelve, if you count the one time when the guy got up again as a different fight.Point is, if you want your little girl safe, you dont want her in a tunnel with a guy firing a gun who doesnt know what hes doing.As if in punctuation, Amos slid the gun together.The metal clacked.Ill be fine, Prax said, but his legs were trembling, just standing up.Amos held up the gun.This ready to fire?Amos asked.Sorry?If you pick this gun up right now, point it at a bad guy, pull the trigger, does it go bang?You just watched me put it together.Dangerous or safe?Prax opened his mouth, then closed it.An ache just behind his sternum grew a notch worse.Amos started to put the gun down.Safe, Prax said.You sure about that, Doc?You didnt put any bullets in it.Its safe.Youre sure?Yes.Amos frowned at the gun.Well, yeah, thats right, he said.But youre still not going.Voices came from the narrow hallway from the airlock.Jim Holdens voice wasnt what Prax had thought it would be.Hed expected him to be serious, grave.Instead, even during the times like now, when the distress clipped his vowels short and tightened his voice, there was a lightness to him.The womans voice  Naomi, not Cassandra wasnt deeper, but it was darker.Those are the numbers, she said.Theyre wrong, Holden said, ducking into the mess.Theyve got to be wrong.It doesnt make sense.Whats the word, Capn?Amos asked.Securitys not going to be any use, Holden said.The locals are stretched too thin trying to keep the place from straight out catastrophe.Which is why maybe we shouldnt be going in with guns drawn, Naomi said.Please, can we not have that conversation again right now?Her mouth hardened and Amos pointedly looked at the gun, polishing the parts that already shone.Prax had the sense of walking in on a much longer conversation.This guy who grabs a gun first and talks later Naomi said.You didnt used to be him.You arent him.Well, I need to be him today, Holden said in a voice that closed the subject.The silence was uncomfortable.Whats wrong with the numbers?Prax asked.Holden looked at him, confused.You said there was something wrong with the numbers.Theyre saying that the death rates going up.But thats got to be wrong.The fighting was what?One day?Day and a half?Why would things be getting worse now?No, Prax said.Thats right.Its the cascade.Itll get worse.Whats the cascade?Naomi asked.Amos slid the pistol into its box and hauled out a longer case.A shotgun maybe.His gaze was on Prax, waiting.Its the basic obstacle of artificial ecosystems.In a normal evolutionary environment, theres enough diversity to cushion the system when something catastrophic happens.Thats nature.Catastrophic things happen all the time.But nothing we can build has the depth.One thing goes wrong, and theres only a few compensatory pathways that can step in.They get overstressed.Fall out of balance.When the next one fails, there are even fewer paths, and then theyre more stressed.Its a simple complex system.Thats the technical name for it.Because its simple, its prone to cascades, and because its complex, you cant predict whats going to fail.Or how.Its computationally impossible.Holden leaned against the wall, his arms folded.It was still odd, seeing him in person.He looked the same as he had on the screens, and he also didnt.Ganymede Station, Holden said, is the most important food supply and agricultural center outside Earth and Mars.It cant just collapse.They wouldnt let it.People come here to have their babies, for Gods sake.Prax tilted his head.A day before, he wouldnt have been able to explain this.For one thing, he wouldnt have had the blood sugar to fuel thought.For another, he wouldnt have had anyone to say it to.It was good to be able to think again, even if it was only so he could explain how bad things had become.Ganymedes dead, Prax said.The tunnels will probably survive, but the environmental and social structures are already broken.Even if we could somehow get the environmental systems back in place and really, we cant without a lot of work how many people are going to stay here now?How many would be going to jail?Somethings going to fill the niche, but it wont be what was here before.Because of the cascade, Holden said.Yes, Prax said.Thats what I was trying to say before.To Amos.Its all going to fall apart.The relief efforts going to make the fall a little more graceful, maybe.But its too late.Its too late, and since Meis out there, and we dont know whats going to break, I have to go with you.Prax, Cassandra said.No.Naomi.Maybe his brain wasnt really up to full power even now.Strickland and that woman, even if they think they can keep her safe, they cant.You see?Even if theyre not hurting her, even if theyre not, everything around them is going to fall apart.What if they run out of air?What if they dont understand whats happening?I know this is hard, Holden said.But shouting about it wont help.Im not shouting.Im not shouting.Im just telling you that they took my little girl away, and I need to go and get her.I need to be there when you open that door.Even if shes not there.Even if shes dead, I need to be the one who finds her.The sound was crisp and professional and oddly beautiful: a magazine slipping into a pistol.Prax hadnt seen Amos take it back out of its box, but the dark metal was in the mans huge hand.Dwarfed by his fingers.While he watched, Amos chambered a round.Then he took the gun by its barrel, careful to keep it pointing at the wall, and held it out.But I thought Prax said.You said I wasnt  Amos stretched his arms out another half inch.The gesture was unmistakable.Take it.Prax took it.It was heavier than it looked.Um.Amos?Holden said.Did you just give him a loaded gun?Doc needs to go, Capn, Amos said with a shrug.So Im thinking he should probably go.Prax saw the look that passed between Holden and Naomi.We might want to talk about that decision making process, Amos, Naomi said, shaping the words carefully.You betcha, Amos said.Soon as we get back.Prax had been walking through the station for weeks as a native, a local.A refugee with nowhere to flee.Hed gotten used to how the hallways looked, how peoples eyes slid over him in case hed try to lay his burdens on them.Now that Prax was fed and armed and part of a group, the station had become a different place.Peoples eyes still slid across them, but the fear was different, and hunger fought against it.Holden and Amos didnt have the gray of malnutrition or the haunted look around their eyes of seeing everything they thought was immutable collapse.Naomi was back at the ship, hacked into the local security network and ready to coordinate the three of them in case they got split up.For the first time perhaps in his life, Prax felt like an outsider.He looked at his hometown and saw what Holden would see: a huge hallway with paints and dyes worked into the ice up high on the wall; the lower half, where people might accidentally touch it, covered in thick insulation.Ganymedes raw ice would strip the flesh from bone with even the briefest contact.The hallway was too dark now, the floodlights beginning to fail.A wide corridor Prax had walked through every day he was at school was a dim chamber filled with the sounds of dripping water as the climate regulation failed.The plants that werent dead were dying, and the air was getting the stale taste at the back of his throat that meant the emergency recyclers would be coming on soon.Should be coming on soon.Had better.Holden was right, though.The thin faced, desperate people they passed had been food scientists and soil technicians, gas exchange experts and agricultural support staff.If Ganymede Station died, the cascade wouldnt stop here.Once the last load of food lifted off, the Belt, the Jovian system, and the myriad long term bases in their own orbits around the sun would have to find a different way to get vitamins and micronutrients for their kids.Prax started wondering whether the bases on the far planets would be able to sustain themselves.If they had full hydroponics rigs and yeast farms and nothing went wrong  It was a distraction.It was grasping anything other than the fear of what would be waiting behind that door.He embraced it.Hold up!All yall.The voice was low and rough and wet, like the mans vocal cords had been taken out and dragged through mud.He stood in the center of the ice tunnels intersecting before them, military police body armor two sizes too small straining to keep his bulk in.His accent and build said he was Martian.Amos and Holden paused, turned, looking everywhere but at the man before them.Prax followed their gazes.Other men lurked, half hidden, around them.The sudden panic tasted like copper.I make six, Holden said.What about the guy with the gray pants?Amos asked.Okay, maybe seven.Hes been with us since we left the ship, though.He might be something else.Six is still more than three, Naomi said in their ears.You want me to send backup?Hot damn.Weve got backup?Amos asked.Gonna have Supitayaporn come down and talk em all to death?We can take them, Prax said, reaching for the pistol in his pocket.We cant let anyone   Amos wide hand closed over his own, keeping the gun in his pocket and out of sight.These arent the ones you shoot, Amos said.These are the ones you talk to.Holden stepped toward the Martian.The ease with which he held himself made the assault rifle on his shoulder seem almost innocuous.Even the expensive body armor he wore didnt seem at odds with his casual smile.Hey, Holden said.There a problem, sir?Might be, the Martian drawled.Might not.Thats your call.Ill take not, Holden said.Now, if youll excuse us, well be on   Slow down, the Martian said, sidling forward.His face was vaguely like someone Prax had seen before on the tube and never particularly remarked.Youre not from around here.I am, Prax said.Im Dr.Praxidike Meng.Chief botanist on the RMD Southern soy farm project.Who are you?Let the capn do this, Amos said.But   Hes pretty good at it.Im thinking youre part of the relief work, the Martian said.Long way from the docks.Looks like you lost your way.Maybe you need an escort back to where its safe.Holden shifted his weight.The assault rifle just happened to slide forward a few inches, not at all provocatively.I dont know, Holden said.Were pretty well protected.I think we can probably take care of ourselves.What kind of fee are you um, escorts asking?Well now.I count three of you.Call it a hundred in Martian scrip.Five, local.How about you follow us down, and I arrange passage for all of you off this ice ball?The Martians jaw dropped.Thats not funny, he said, but the mask of power and confidence had slipped.Prax had seen the hunger and desperation behind it.Im going to an old tunnel system, Holden said.Someone abducted a bunch of kids right before everything went to hell.They took them there.Docs kid was one of the ones that got snatched.Were going to get her back and politely ask how they knew all this was coming down.Might be resistance.I could use a few people who know what end of the gun points forward.Youre fucking with me, the Martian said.From the corner of his eye, Prax saw one of the others step forward.A thin woman in cheap protective weave.Were OPA, Amos said, then nodded at Holden.Hes James Holden of the Rocinante.Holy shit, the Martian said.You are.Youre Holden.Its the beard, Holden said.My names Wendell.Used to work for Pinkwater Security before the bastards took off, left us here.Way I figure, that voids the contract.You want to pick up some professional firepower, you aint gonna find better than us.How many you got?Six, counting me.Holden looked over at Amos.Prax felt Amos shrug as much as saw it.The other man theyd been talking about was unrelated after all.All right, Holden said.We tried to talk to local security, but they didnt give us the time of day.Follow me, back us up, and I give you my word youll get off Ganymede.Wendell grinned.Hed had one of his incisors dyed red with a small black and white design on it.Anything you say, boss, he said.Then, lifting his gun: Form up!We got us a new contract, people.Lets get it done!The whoops came from all around them.Prax found the thin woman beside him, grinning and shaking his hand like she was running for office.Prax blinked and smiled back, and Amos put his hand on Praxs shoulder.See?Told you.Now lets get moving.The hallway was darker than it had seemed in the video.The ice had thin melt channels, like pale veins, but the frost covering them was fresh.The door looked like any other of a hundred theyd passed on the way in.Prax swallowed.His stomach ached.He wanted to scream for Mei, to call her name and hear her call back.Okay, Naomi said in his ear.Ive got the lock disabled.Whenever you guys are ready.No time like the present, Holden said.Open it up.The seal around the door hissed.The door opened.Fifteen: Bobbie  Three hours into the first big meeting between the Martian and UN diplomats and theyd only just got past introducing everyone and on to reading the agenda.A squat Earther in a charcoal gray suit that probably cost more than Bobbies recon armor droned on about Section 14, Subsection D, Items 1 11, in which they would discuss the effect of past hostilities on commodity pricing pursuant to existing trade agreements.Bobbie looked around, noticed that everyone else at the long oak table was staring with rapt attention at the agenda reader, and stifled the truly epic yawn that was struggling to get out.She distracted herself by trying to figure out who people were.Theyd all been introduced by name and title at some point, but that didnt mean much.Everyone here was an assistant secretary, or undersecretary, or director of something.There were even a few generals, but Bobbie knew enough about how politics worked to know that the military people in the room would be the least important.The people with real power would be the quiet ones with unassuming titles.There were several of those, including a moonfaced man with a skinny tie whod been introduced as the secretary of something or other.Sitting next to him was someones grandmother in a bright sari, a splash of yellow in the middle of all the dark brown and dark blue and charcoal gray.She sat and munched pistachios and wore an enigmatic half smile.Bobbie entertained herself for a few minutes by trying to guess if Moonface or Grandma was the boss.She considered pouring a glass of water from one of the crystal decanters evenly distributed across the table.She wasnt thirsty, but turning her glass over, pouring water into it, and drinking it would burn a minute, maybe two.She glanced down the table and noticed that no one else was drinking the water.Maybe everyone was waiting for someone else to be first.Lets take a short break, charcoal suit man said.Ten minutes, then we can move on to Section fifteen of the agenda.People got up and began dispersing toward restrooms and smoking areas.Grandma carried her handbag to a recycling chute and dumped pistachio shells into it.Moonface pulled out his terminal and called someone.Jesus, Bobbie said, rubbing her eyes with her palms until she saw stars.Problem, Sergeant?Thorsson said, leaning back in his chair and grinning.The gravity wearing on you?No, Bobbie said.Then, Well, yes, but mostly Im ready to jab a stylus into my eye, just for a change of pace.Thorsson nodded and patted her hand, a move he was using more often now.It hadnt gotten any less irritating and paternalistic, but now Bobbie was worried that it might mean Thorsson was working up to hitting on her.That would be an uncomfortable moment.She pulled her hand away and leaned toward Thorsson until he turned and looked her in the eye.Why, she whispered, is no one talking about the goddamned monster?Isnt that why Im why were here?You have to understand how these things work, Thorsson said, turning away from her and fiddling with his terminal.Politics moves slow because the stakes are very high, and no one wants to be the person that screwed it up.He put his terminal down and gave her a wink.Careers are at stake here.Careers  Thorsson just nodded and tapped on his terminal some more.Careers?For a moment, she was on her back, staring up into the star filled void above Ganymede.Her men were dead or dying.Her suit radio dead, her armor a frozen coffin.She saw the things face.Without a suit in the radiation and hard vacuum, the red snowfall of flash frozen blood around its claws.And no one at this table wanted to talk about it because it might affect their careers?To hell with that.When the meetings attendees had shuffled back into the room and taken their places around the table, Bobbie raised her hand.She felt faintly ridiculous, like a fifth grade student in a room full of adults, but she had no idea what the actual protocol for asking a question was.The agenda reader shot her one annoyed glance, then ignored her.Thorsson reached under the table and sharply squeezed her leg.She kept her hand up.Excuse me?she said.People around the table took turns giving her increasingly unfriendly looks and then pointedly turning away.Thorsson upped the pressure on her leg until shed had enough of him and grabbed his wrist with her other hand.She squeezed until the bones creaked and he snatched his hand away with a surprised gasp.He turned his chair to look at her, his eyes wide and his mouth a flat, lipless line.Yellow sari placed a hand on the agenda readers arm, and he instantly stopped talking.Okay, that one is the boss, Bobbie decided.I, for one, Grandma said, smiling a mild apology at the room, would like to hear what Sergeant Draper has to say.She remembers my name, Bobbie thought.Thats interesting.Sergeant?Grandma said.Bobbie, unsure of what to do, stood up.Im just wondering why no one is talking about the monster.Grandmas enigmatic smile returned.No one spoke.The silence slid adrenaline into Bobbies blood.She felt her legs starting to tremble.More than anything in the world, she wanted to sit down, to make them all forget her and look away.She scowled and locked her knees.You know, Bobbie said, her voice rising, but she was unable to stop it.The monster that killed fifty soldiers on Ganymede?The reason were all here?The room was silent.Thorsson stared at her like she had lost her mind.Maybe she had.Grandma tugged once at her yellow sari and smiled encouragement.I mean, Bobbie said, holding up the agenda, Im sure trade agreements and water rights and who gets to screw who on the second Thursday after the winter solstice is all very important!She stopped to suck in a long breath, the gravity and her tirade seeming to have robbed her of air.She could see it in their eyes.She could see that if she just stopped now, shed be an odd thing that happened and everyone could go back to work and quickly forget her.She could see her career not crashing off a cliff in flames.She discovered that she didnt care.But, she said, throwing the agenda across the table, where a surprised man in a brown suit dodged it as though its touch might infect him with whatever Bobbie had, what about the fucking monster?Before she could continue, Thorsson popped up from his seat.Excuse me for a moment, ladies and gentlemen.Sergeant Draper is suffering from some post combat related stress and needs attention.He grabbed her elbow and drove her from the room, a rising wave of murmurs pushing at their backs.Thorsson stopped in the conference rooms lobby and waited for the door to shut behind him.You, Thorsson said, shoving her toward a chair.Normally the skinny intelligence officer couldnt have pushed her anywhere, but all the strength seemed to have run out of her legs, and she collapsed into the seat.You, he repeated.Then, to someone on his terminal, he said, Get down here, now.You, he said a third time, pointing at Bobbie, then paced back and forth in front of her chair.A few minutes later, Captain Martens came trotting into the conference room lobby.He pulled up short when he saw Bobbie slouched in her chair and Thorssons angry face.What  he started, but Thorsson cut him off.This is your fault, he said to Martens, then spun to face Bobbie.And you, Sergeant, have just proven that it was a monumental mistake to bring you along.Any benefit that might have been gained from having the only eyewitness has now been squandered by your your idiotic tirade.She  Martens tried again, but Thorsson poked a finger into his chest and said, You said you could control her.Martens gave Thorsson a sad smile.No, I never said that.I said I could help her given enough time.Doesnt matter, Thorsson said, waving a hand at them.Youre both on the next ship to Mars, where you can explain yourselves to a disciplinary board.Now get out of my sight.He spun on his heel and slipped back into the conference room, opening the door only wide enough for his narrow body to squeeze through.Martens sat down in the chair next to Bobbie and let out a long breath.So, he said.Whats up?Did I just destroy my career?she asked.Maybe.How do you feel?I feel she said, realizing how badly she did want to talk with Martens, and becoming angered by the impulse.I feel like I need some air.Before Martens could protest, Bobbie stood up and headed for the elevators.The UN complex was a city in its own right.Just finding a way out took her the better part of an hour.Along the way, she moved through the chaos and energy of government like a ghost.People hurried past her in the long corridors, talking energetically in clumps or on their hand terminals.Bobbie had never been to Olympia, where the Martian congressional building was located.Shed caught a few minutes of congressional sessions on the government broadcast when an issue she cared about was being discussed, but compared to the activity here at the UN, it was pretty low key.The people in this building complex governed thirty billion citizens and hundreds of millions of colonists.By comparison, Mars four billion suddenly seemed like a backwater.On Mars, it was a generally accepted fact that Earth was a civilization in decay.Lazy, coddled citizens who lived on the government dole.Fat, corrupt politicians who enriched themselves at the expense of the colonies.A degrading infrastructure that spent close to 30 percent of its total output on recycling systems to keep the population from drowning in its own filth.On Mars, there was virtually no unemployment.The entire population was engaged either directly or indirectly in the greatest engineering feat in human history: the terraforming of a planet.It gave everyone a sense of purpose, a shared vision of the future.Nothing like the Earthers, who lived only for their next government payout and their next visit to the drugstore or entertainment malls.Or at least, that was the story.Suddenly Bobbie wasnt so sure.Repeated visits to the various information kiosks scattered through the complex eventually got her to an exit door.A bored guard nodded to her as she passed by, and then she was outside.Outside.Without a suit.Five seconds later she was clawing at the door, which she now realized was an exit only, trying to get back in.The guard took pity on her and pushed the door open.She ran back inside and collapsed on a nearby settee, gasping and hyperventilating.First time?the guard asked with a smile.Bobbie found herself unable to speak, but nodded.Mars or Luna?Mars, she said once her breathing had slowed.Yeah, I knew it.Domes, you know.People whove been in domes just panic a bit.Belters lose their shit.And I mean completely.We wind up shipping them home drugged up to keep them from screaming.Yeah, Bobbie said, happy to let the guard ramble while she collected herself.No kidding.They bring you in when it was dark outside?Yeah.They do that for offworlders.Helps with the agoraphobia.Yeah.Ill hold the door open a bit for you.In case you need to come back in again.The assumption that shed give it a second try instantly won Bobbie over, and she actually looked at the guard for the first time.Earther short, but with beautiful skin so dark it was almost blue.He had a compact, athletic frame and lovely gray eyes.He was smiling at her without a trace of mockery.Thank you, she said.Bobbie.Bobbie Draper.Chuck, he replied.Look at the ground, then slowly look to the horizon.Whatever you do, dont look straight up.I think I got it this time, Chuck, but thanks.Chuck gave her uniform a quick glance and said, Semper fi, Gunny.Oohrah, Bobbie replied with a grin.On her second trip outside, she did as Chuck had recommended and looked down at the ground for a few moments.This helped reduce the feeling of massive sensory overload.But only a little.A thousand scents hit her nose, competing for dominance.The rich aroma of plants and soil she would expect in a garden dome.The oil and hot metal from a fabrication lab.The ozone of electric motors.All of them hit her at once, layered on top of each other and mixed with scents too exotic to name.And the sounds were a constant cacophony.People talking, construction machinery, electric cars, a transorbital shuttle lifting off, all at once and all the time.It was no wonder it had caused a panic.Just two senses worth of data threatened to overwhelm her.Add that impossibly blue sky that stretched on forever  Bobbie stood outside, eyes closed, breathing until she heard Chuck let the door close behind her.Now she was committed.Turning around and asking Chuck to let her back in would be admitting defeat.Hed clearly done some time in the UNMC, and she wasnt going to look weak in front of the competition.Hell no.When her ears and nose had gotten more accustomed to the barrage of inputs, she opened her eyes again, looking down at the concrete of the walkway.Slowly, she lifted them till the horizon was in view.Ahead of her lay long sidewalks passing through meticulously tended green space.Beyond it in the distance was a gray wall that must have stood ten meters high, with guard towers regularly spaced on it.The UN complex had a surprising amount of security.She wondered if shed be able to get out.She neednt have worried.As she approached the guarded gate to the outside world, the security system queried her terminal, which assured it of her VIP status.A camera above the guard post scanned her face, compared it to the picture on file, and verified her identity while she was still twenty meters from the gate.When she reached the exit, the guard snapped her a sharp salute and asked if shed need a ride.No, just going for a walk, she said.The guard smiled and wished her a good day.She began walking down the street leading away from the UN complex, then turned around to see two armed security personnel following her at a discreet distance.She shrugged and walked on.Somebody would probably lose their job if a VIP like her got lost or hurt.Once Bobbie was outside the UN compound, her agoraphobia lessened.Buildings rose around her like walls of steel and glass, moving the dizzying skyline far enough up that she no longer saw it.Small electric cars whizzed down the streets, trailing a high pitched whine and the scent of ozone.And people were everywhere.Bobbie had gone to a couple of games at Armstrong Stadium on Mars, to watch the Red Devils play.The stadium had seats for twenty thousand fans.Because the Devils were usually at the bottom of the standings, it generally held less than half that.That relatively modest number was the greatest number of humans Bobbie had ever seen in one place at one time.There were billions of people on Mars, but there werent a lot of open spaces for them to gather.Standing at an intersection, looking down two streets that seemed to stretch into infinity, Bobbie was sure she saw more than the average attendance of a Red Devils game just walking on the sidewalks.She tried to imagine how many people were in the buildings that rose to vertigo inducing heights in every direction around her, and couldnt.Millions of people, probably in just the buildings and streets she could see.And if Martian propaganda was right, most of the people she could see right now didnt have jobs.She tried to imagine that, not having any particular place you had to be on any given day.What the Earthers had discovered is that when people have nothing else to do, they have babies.For a brief period in the twentieth and twenty first centuries, the population had looked like it might shrink rather than continue to grow.As more and more women went into higher education, and from there to jobs, the average family size grew smaller.A few decades of massive employment shrinkage ended that.Or, again, that was what shed been taught in school.Only here on Earth, where food grew on its own, where air was just a by product of random untended plants, where resources lay thick on the ground, could a person actually choose not to do anything at all.There was enough extra created by those who felt the need to work that the surplus could feed the rest.A world no longer of the haves and the have nots, but of the engaged and the apathetic.Bobbie found herself standing next to a street level coffee shop and took a seat.Can I get you anything?a smiling young woman with brightly dyed blue hair asked.Whats good?We make the best soy milk tea, if you like that.Sure, Bobbie said, not sure what soy milk tea was, but liking those two things separately enough to take a chance.The blue haired girl bustled away and chatted with an equally young man behind the bar while he made the tea.Bobbie looked around her, noticing that everyone she saw working was about the same age.When the tea arrived, she said, Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?The girl shrugged, her smile an invitation.Is everyone who works here the same age?Well, she said.Pretty close.Gotta collect your pre university credits, right?Im not from here, Bobbie said.Explain that.Blue seemed actually to see her for the first time, looking over her uniform and its various insignias.Oh, wow, Mars, right?I want to go there.Yeah, its great.So tell me about the credits thing.They dont have that on Mars?she asked, puzzled.Okay, so, if you apply to a university, you have to have at least a year of work credits.To make sure you like working.You know, so they dont waste classroom space on people who will just go on basic afterward.Basic?You know, basic support.I think I understand, Bobbie said.Basic support is the money you live on if you dont work?Not money, you know, just basic.Gotta work to have money.Thanks, Bobbie said, then sipped her milk tea as Blue trotted to another table.The tea was delicious.She had to admit, it made a sad kind of sense to do some early winnowing before spending the resources to educate people.Bobbie told her terminal to pay the bill, and it flashed a total at her after calculating the exchange rate.She added a nice tip for the blue haired girl who wanted more from life than basic support.Bobbie wondered if Mars would become like this after the terraforming.If Martians didnt have to fight every day to make enough resources to survive, would they turn into this?A culture where you could actually choose if you wanted to contribute?The work hours and collective intelligence of fifteen billion humans just tossed away as acceptable losses for the system.It made Bobbie sad to think of.All that effort to get to a point where they could live like this.Sending their kids to work at a coffee shop to see if they were up to contributing.Letting them live the rest of their lives on basic if they werent.But one thing was for sure: All that running and exercising the Martian Marines did at one full gravity was bullshit.There was no way Mars could ever beat Earth on the ground.You could drop every Martian soldier, fully armed, into just one Earth city and the citizens would overwhelm them using rocks and sticks.Deep in the grip of pathos, she suddenly felt a massive weight lift that she hadnt even realized shed been carrying.Thorsson and his bullshit didnt matter.The pissing contest with Earth didnt matter.Making Mars into another Earth didnt matter, not if this was where it was headed.All that mattered was finding out whod put that thing on Ganymede.She tossed off the last of her tea and thought, Ill need a ride.Sixteen: Holden  Beyond the door lay a long hallway that looked, to Holden, exactly the same as every other hallway on Ganymede: ice walls with moisture resistant and insulated structural plates and inset conduit, rubberized walking surface, full spectrum LEDs to mimic sunlight slanting down from the blue skies of Earth.They could have been anywhere.Were sure this is right, Naomi?Thats the one we saw Mei go through in the hackers footage, she replied.Okay, he said, then dropped to one knee and motioned for his ad hoc army to do the same.When everyone was in a rough circle around him, he said, Our overwatch, Naomi, has intel on the layout of these tunnels, but not much else.We have no idea where the bad guys are, or even if theyre still here.Prax started to object, but Amos quieted him with a heavy hand on his back.So we could conceivably leave a lot of intersections at our back.I dont like that.Yeah, said Wendell, the Pinkwater leader.I dont like that much either.So were going to leave a lookout at each intersection until we know where were going, Holden replied, then said, Naomi, put all their hand terminals on our channel.Guys, put in your ear buds.Comm discipline is dont speak unless I ask a direct question, or someone is about to die.Roger, said Wendell, echoed by the rest of his team.Once we know what were looking at, Ill call all the lookouts up to our position if needed.If not, theyre our way out of here if were in over our heads.Nods all around.Outstanding.Amos is point.Wendell, you cover our asses.Everyone else, string out at one meter intervals, Holden said, then tapped on Wendells breastplate.We do this thing clean, and Ill talk to my OPA people about putting a few credits in your accounts in addition to getting you offworld.Righteous, the thin woman with the cheap armor said, and then racked a round in her machine pistol.Okay, lets go.Amos, Naomis map says fifty meters to another pressure door, then some warehouse space.Amos nodded, then shouldered his weapon, a heavy automatic shotgun with a thick magazine.He had several more magazines and a number of grenades dangling from his Martian armors harness.The metal clicked a little as he walked.Amos headed off down the hallway at a fast walk.Holden gave a quick glance behind, gratified to see the Pinkwater people keeping up the pace and the spacing.They might look half starved, but they knew what they were doing.Cap, theres a tunnel coming off to the right just before the pressure door, Amos said, stopping and dropping to one knee to cover the unexpected corridor.It didnt appear on the map.That meant that new tunnels had been dug after the station specs had last been updated.Modifications like that meant he had even less information than hed thought.It wasnt a good thing.Okay, Holden said, pointing at the thin woman with the machine pistol.You are?Paula, she said.Paula, this is your intersection.Try not to shoot anyone that doesnt shoot at you first, but do not let anyone past you for any reason.Solid copy on that, Paula said, and took up a position looking down the side corridor with her weapon at the ready.Amos pulled a grenade off his harness and handed it to her.Just in case shit goes down, he said.Paula nodded, settled her back against the wall.Amos, taking point, moved toward the pressure door.Naomi, Holden said, looking over the door and locking mechanism.Pressure door, uh, 223 B6.Pop it.Got it, she said.A few seconds later, Holden heard the bolts retract.Ten meters to the next mapped intersection, he said, then looked at the Pinkwater people and picked one gruff looking older man at random.Thats your intersection when we get there.The man nodded, and Holden gestured at Amos.The mechanic took hold of the hatch with his right hand and began counting down from five with his left.Holden took up a position facing the door, his assault rifle at the ready.When Amos hit one, Holden took a deep breath, and he burst through the door as Amos yanked it open a split second later.Nothing.Just another ten meters of corridor, dimly lit by the few LEDs that hadnt failed in the decades since its last use.Years of micro frost melt had built a texture over the surface of the walls like dripping spiderwebs.It looked delicate, but it was mineralized as hard as stone.It reminded Holden of a graveyard.Amos began advancing to the intersection and the next hatch, his gun aimed down the hallway.Holden followed him, his rifle tracking right as he kept it aimed at the side passage, the reflex to cover every possible ingress point to their position having become automatic over the last year.His year as a cop.Naomi had said this wasnt him.Hed left the Navy without seeing live combat outside pirate hunting from the comfort of a warships operations deck.Hed worked for years on the Canterbury, hauling ice from Saturn to the Belt without ever having to worry about something more violent than drunken ice buckers fighting out their boredom.Hed been the peacemaker, the one who always found the way to keep things cool.When tempers flared, hed keep it calm or keep it funny or just sit for a shift and listen to someone rave and rant whatever it was out of their system.This new person hed become reached for his gun first and talked second.Maybe she was right.How many ships had he slagged in the year since Eros?A dozen?More?He comforted himself with the thought that they were all very bad people.The worst kind of carrion eaters, using the chaos of war and the retreat of the Coalition Navy as an opportunity to pillage.The kind of people whod strip all the expensive parts off your engine, steal your spare air, and leave you adrift to suffocate.Every one of their ships hed shot down had probably saved dozens of innocent ships, hundreds of lives.But doing it had taken something from him that he occasionally felt the lack of.Occasions like when Naomi had said, This isnt you.If they tracked down the secret base where Mei had been taken, there was a good chance theyd have to fight to get her back.Holden found himself hoping it would bother him, if for no other reason than to prove that it still could.Cap?You okay?Amos was staring at him.Yeah, Holden said, I just need a different job.Might not be the best moment for a career change, Cap.Fair point, Holden said, and pointed to the older Pinkwater man hed singled out before.This is your intersection.Same instructions.Hold it unless I call you.The older guy shrugged and nodded, then turned to Amos.Dont I get a grenade too?Nah, Amos said, Paulas cuter than you.He counted down from five, and Holden went through the door, same as last time.Hed been ready for another featureless gray corridor, but on the other side there was a wide open space, with a few tables and dusty equipment scattered haphazardly around the room.A massive 3 D copier emptied of resin and partially disassembled, a few light industrial waldoes, the kind of complex automated supply cabinet that usually lurked under desks in scientific labs or medical bays.The mineralized webwork was on the walls but not the boxes or equipment.A glass walled cube two meters to a side sat off in one corner.One of the tables had a small bundle of sheets or tarps piled on it.Across the room another hatch stood closed.Holden pointed to the abandoned equipment and said to Wendell, See if you can find a network access point.If you can, plug this into it.He handed Naomis hastily rigged network bridge to him.Amos sent two of the remaining Pinkwater people up to the next hatch to cover it, then came back to Holden and gestured with his gun toward the glass box.Big enough for a couple kids, he said.Think thats where they kept em?Maybe, Holden said, moving over to examine it.Prax, can you  Holden stopped when he realized the botanist had gone over to the tables and was standing next to the bundle of rags.With Prax standing next to the bundle, Holdens perspective shifted and suddenly it didnt look like a pile of rags at all.It looked very much like a small body under a sheet.Prax was staring at it, his hand darting toward it and then pulling back.He was shaking all over.This this is he said to no one in particular, his hand moving out and back again.Holden looked at Amos, then gestured at Prax with his eyes.The big mechanic moved over to him and put a hand on his arm.Hows about you let us take a look at that, okay?Holden let Amos guide Prax a few steps away from the table before he moved over to it.When he lifted the sheet to look under, Prax made a sharp noise like the intake of breath before a scream.Holden shifted his body to block Praxs view.A small boy lay on the table.He was skinny, with a mop of unruly black hair and dark skin.His clothes were bright: yellow pants and a green shirt with a cartoon crocodile and daisies.It wasnt immediately clear what had killed him.Holden heard a commotion and turned around to see Prax, red faced and struggling to get past Amos to the table.The mechanic was restraining him with one arm in a grip that was halfway between a wrestling hold and an embrace.Its not her, Holden said.Its a kid, but its not her.A boy.Four, maybe five years old.When Amos heard that, he let the struggling Prax go.The botanist rushed to the table, flipping the sheet over and giving one quick cry.Thats Katoa, Prax said.I know him.His father  Its not Mei, Holden repeated, putting a hand on Praxs shoulder.We need to keep looking.Prax shrugged his hand off.Its not Mei, Holden said again.But Strickland was here, Prax said.He was their doctor.I thought if he was with them, theyd be  Holden said nothing.He was thinking the same thing.If one of the kids was dead, they could all be.I thought that meant theyd keep them alive, Prax said.But they let Katoa die.They just let him die and they put him under this sheet.Basia, Im so sorry  Holden grabbed Prax and spun him around.The way he imagined a cop would.That, he said, pointing at the small body on the table, is not Mei.Do you want to find her?Then we need to keep moving.Praxs eyes were filled with tears and his shoulders shook in silent sobs, but he nodded and walked away from the table.Amos watched him carefully.The mechanics expression was unreadable.The thought came unbidden: I hope bringing Prax was a good idea.Across the room, Wendell whistled and waved a hand.He pointed at Naomis network access rig plugged into a port in the wall and gave the thumbs up.Naomi, you in?Holden said while he pulled the sheet back up to cover the dead boy.Yep, Im in, she said, her tone distracted as she worked with the incoming data.Traffic in this node is encrypted.Got the Somnambulist started on it, but shes not nearly as smart as the Roci.This could take a while.Keep trying, Holden replied, and signaled to Amos.But if theres traffic on the network, someones still here.If you wait a minute, Naomi said, I might be able to give you the security cameras and a more up to date floor plan.Feed us what you can, when you can, but were not waiting.Amos ambled over to Holden and tapped the visor of his helmet.Prax was standing alone by the glass cube, staring into it like there was something to see.Holden expected Amos to say something about the man, but Amos surprised him.Been paying attention to the temperature, Cap?Yeah, Holden replied.Every time I check it says cold as hell.I was just over by the door, Amos continued.It went up about half a degree.Holden thought about that for a moment, double checking it on his own HUD and tapping his fingers on his thigh.Theres climate in the next room.Theyre heating it.Seems likely, Amos said, shifting the big auto shotgun into both hands and thumbing off the safety.Holden motioned the remaining Pinkwater people over to them.It looks like weve come to the inhabited portion of this base.Amos and I go in first.You three Holden pointed at the three Pinkwater people who werent Wendell follow and cover our flanks.Wendell, you cover our asses and make sure we can get back out in a hurry if things go bad.Prax   Holden stopped, looking around for the botanist.He had quietly slipped over to the door into the next room.Hed taken the handgun Amos had given him out of his pocket.As Holden watched, he reached out and opened the door, then walked deliberately through.Fuck me, Amos said conversationally.Shit, Holden said.Then, Go, go, go, as he rushed toward the now open door.Just before he got to the hatch, he heard Prax say, Nobody move, in a loud but quavering voice.Holden burst through into the room on the other side, going right while Amos came through just behind him and went left.Prax stood a few feet past the door, the large black handgun looking improbable in his pale, shaking hand.The area itself looked a lot like the one theyd just left, except that this one had a small crowd of people in it.Armed people.Holden tried to take in everything that could be used as cover.A half dozen large gray packing crates with scientific equipment in various states of disassembly in them squatted around the room.Someones hand terminal was propped up on a bench and blaring dance music.On one of the crates sat several open boxes of pizza with most of the slices missing, several of which were still clutched in peoples hands.He tried to count them.Four.Eight.An even dozen, all of them wide about the eye and glancing around, thinking about what to do.It looked to Holden very much like a room full of people packing up to move, taking a short lunch break.Except that the people in this room all had holsters at their sides, and they had left the corpse of a small child to rot in the next room over.Nobody!Move!Prax repeated, this time with more force.You should listen to him, Holden added, moving the barrel of his assault rifle in a slow scan across the room.To drive the point home, Amos sidled up to the nearest worker and casually slammed the butt of his auto shotgun into the mans ribs, dropping him to the floor like a bag of wet sand.Holden heard the tramping of his Pinkwater people rushing into the room behind him and taking up cover positions.Wendell, Holden said, not lowering his rifle.Please disarm these people for me.No, said a stern faced woman with a slice of pizza in her hand.No, I dont think so.Excuse me?Holden said.No, the woman repeated, taking another bite of her pizza.Around a mouthful of food, she said, There are only seven of you.There are twelve of us just in this room alone.And there are a lot more behind us that will come running at the first gunshot.So, no, you dont get to disarm us.She smiled a greasy smile at Holden, then took another bite.Holden could smell the cheese and pepperoni smell of good pizza over the top of Ganymedes ever present odor of ice and the scent of his own sweat.It made his stomach give an ill timed rumble.Prax pointed his handgun at the woman, though his hand was now shaking so badly that she probably didnt feel particularly threatened.Amos gave him a sidelong glance as if to ask, What now, chief?In Holdens mind, the room shifted into a tactical problem with an almost physical click.The eleven potential combatants who were still standing were in three clusters.None of them were wearing visible armor.Amos would almost certainly drop the group of four to the far left of the room in a single burst from his auto shotgun.Holden was pretty sure he could take down the three directly in front of him.That left four for the Pinkwater people to handle.Best not to count on Prax for any of it.He finished the split second tally of potential casualties, and almost of its own volition, his thumb clicked the assault rifle to full auto.This is not you.Shit.We dont have to do this, he said, instead of opening fire.No one has to die here today.Were looking for a little girl.Help us find her, and everyone walks away from this.Holden could see the arrogance and bravado in the womans face for the mask it was.Behind that, there was worry as she weighed the casualties her team would suffer against the risks of talking it out and seeing where that went.Holden gave her a smile and a nod to help her decide.Talk to me.Were all rational people here.Except that not all of them were.Wheres Mei?Prax yelled, poking the gun at her as if his gesture would be somehow translated through the air.Tell me where Mei is!I  she started to reply, but Prax screamed out, Wheres my little girl!and cocked his gun.As if in slow motion, Holden saw eleven hands dart down to the holsters at their belts.Shit.Seventeen: Prax  In the cinema and games that formed the basis of Praxs understanding of how people of violence interacted, the cocking of a gun was less a threat than a kind of punctuation mark.A security agent questioning someone might begin with threats and slaps, but when he cocked his gun, that meant it was time to take him seriously.It wasnt something Prax had considered any more carefully than which urinal to use when he wasnt the only one in the mens room or how to step on and off a transport tube.It was the untaught etiquette of received wisdom.You yelled, you threatened, you cocked your gun, and then people talked.Wheres my little girl!he yelled.He cocked his pistol.The reaction was almost immediate: a sharp, stuttering report like a high pressure valve failing, but much louder.He danced back, almost dropping the pistol.Had he fired it by mistake?But no, his finger hadnt touched the trigger.The air smelled sharp, acidic.The woman with the pizza was gone.No, not gone.She was on the ground.Something terrible had happened to her jaw.As he watched, her ruined mouth moved, as though she was trying to speak.Prax could hear only a high pitched squeal.He wondered if his eardrums had ruptured.The woman with the destroyed jaw took a long, shuddering breath and then didnt take another.With a sense of detachment, he noticed that shed drawn her pistol.It was still clutched in her hand.He wasnt sure when shed done that.The handset playing dance music transitioned to a different song that only faintly made it past the ringing in his ears.I didnt shoot her, he said.His voice sounded like he was in partial vacuum, the air too thin to support the energy of sound waves.But he could breathe.He wondered again if the gunfire had ruptured his eardrums.He looked around.Everyone was gone.He was alone in the room.Or no, they were behind cover.It occurred to him that he should probably be behind cover too.Only nobody was firing and he wasnt sure where to go.Holdens voice seemed to come from far away.Amos?Yeah, Cap?Would you please take his gun away now?Im on it.Amos rose from behind one of the boxes nearest the wall.His Martian armor had a long pale streak across the chest and two white circles just below the ribs.Amos limped toward him.Sorry, Doc, he said.Givin it to you was my bad call.Maybe next time, right?Prax looked at the big mans open hand, then carefully put the gun in it.Wendell?Holden said.Prax still wasnt sure where he was, but he sounded closer.That was probably just Praxs hearing coming back.The acrid smell in the air changed to something more coppery.It made him think of compost heaps gone sour: warm and organic and unsettling.One down, Wendell said.Well get a medic, Holden said.Nice thought, but no point, Wendell said.Finish the mission.We got most of them, but two or three made it through the door.Theyll raise an alarm.One of the Pinkwater soldiers stood up.Blood was running down his left arm.Another lay on the floor, half of his head simply gone.Holden appeared.He was massaging his right elbow, and the armor showed a new scar at his left temple.What happened?Prax asked.You started a gunfight, Holden said.Okay, lets move ahead before they can set up defenses.Prax started noticing other bodies.Men and women who had been eating pizza and listening to music.Theyd had pistols, but Holdens people carried automatic shotguns and assault rifles and some had military looking armor.The difference in outcome hadnt been subtle.Amos, take point, Holden said, and the big man moved through the doorway and into the unknown.Prax moved to follow, and the head of the Pinkwater people took his elbow.Why dont you stay with me, professor, he said.Yes.Ill all right.On the other side of the door, the nature of the rooms changed.They were still clearly in the old tunnels of Ganymede.The walls still had their webwork of mineralized frost, the lighting was still old fashioned LED housings, and the gray walls showed where ice had melted and refrozen during some climate system glitch years or decades before.But walking through that doorway was walking from the land of the dead into something living.The air was warmer, and it smelled of bodies and fresh soil and the subtle, sharp scent of phenol disinfectant.The wide hall they entered could have been the common room in any of a dozen labs where Prax had worked.Three metal office doors were closed along the far wall and a rolling metal freight gateway hung open ahead of them.Amos and Holden went to the three closed doors, Amos kicking each in turn.When the third flew open, Holden shouted something, but the words were lost in the bark of a pistol and Amos return shotgun fire.The two remaining Pinkwater soldiers who werent Wendell scuttled forward, pressing their backs to the wall on either side of the freight gateway.Prax started toward them, but Wendell put a restraining hand on his shoulder.The man on the left side of the door ducked his head into the doorway and then out again.A bullet gouged a streak in the wall where it missed him.What can you give me?Holden asked, and for a moment Prax thought he was talking to them.Holdens eyes were hard, and the scowl seemed etched into his skin.Then Naomi said something to make him smile, and he only looked tired and sad.All right.Weve got a partial floor plan.Through there, weve got an open room.It drops down about two meters, with exits to our ten oclock and one oclock.Its built like a pit, so if theyre setting up defense here, weve got the high ground.Makes it a damned stupid place to set up a defense, then, Wendell said.Gunfire chattered, three small holes appearing in the metal of the freight gateway.The people on the other side were nervous.And yet the evidence suggests Holden said.You want to talk to em, Cap?Amos said.Or do we head straight for the obvious thing?The question meant something more than Prax understood; he could tell that much.Holden started to say something, hesitated, and then nodded toward the doorway.Lets get this done, he said.Holden and Amos jogged toward the gateway, Prax and Wendell close behind.Someone was shouting orders in the room beyond.Prax made out the words payload and evac, his heart going tight.Evac.They couldnt let anyone leave until they found Mei.I counted seven, one of the Pinkwater soldiers said.Could be more.Any kids?Amos asked.Didnt see any.We should probably look again, Amos said, and leaned out the door.Prax caught his breath, expecting to see the mans head dissolve in a rain of bullets, but Amos was already pulling back when the first shots started.What are we working with?Holden asked.Moren seven, Amos said.Theyre using this as a choke point, but the fellas right.Either they dont know what theyre doing, or theres something in there they cant pull back from.So either panicking amateurs or something critical to defend, Holden said.A metal canister the size of a fist rolled through the gateway, clanking.Amos picked the grenade up casually and tossed it back through the doorway.The detonation lit the room, the report louder than anything Prax had ever heard before.The ringing in his ears redoubled.Could be both, Amos shouted conversationally from very far away.In the next room, something shattered.People were screaming.Prax imagined technicians like the ones from the previous room shredded by shrapnel from their own grenade.One of the Pinkwater soldiers leaned out, peering into the haze of smoke.An assault rifle blatted, and he pulled back, clutching his belly.Blood poured between his fingers.Wendell pushed past Prax, kneeling by his fallen soldier.Sorry, sir, the Pinkwater man said.Got careless.Leave me here and Ill guard the rear as long as I can.Captain Holden, Wendell said.If were going to do something, were better off doing it soon.The screaming in the other room got louder.Someone was roaring inhumanly.Prax wondered if theyd had livestock in there.The bellowing sounded almost like an injured bull.He had to fight the urge to put his hands over his ears.Something loud happened.Holden nodded.Amos.Soften them up, then lets head in.Aye, aye, Cap, Amos said, putting down his shotgun.He took two grenades of his own, pulled the pink plastic strip pins, rolled the live grenades through the gateway, and scooped his gun back up.The doubled detonation was deeper than the first one had been, but not as loud.Even before the echo faded, Amos, Holden, Wendell, and the one remaining soldier ducked through the gateway, weapons blazing.Prax hesitated.He was unarmed.The enemy was just beyond the threshold.He could stay here and tend to the gut shot man.But the image that wouldnt leave him was Katoas still body.The dead boy wasnt more than a hundred meters away.And Mei  Keeping his head down, Prax scuttled through the doorway.Holden and Wendell were to his right, Amos and the other soldier to his left.All four were crouched, weapons at the ready.Smoke stung Praxs eyes and nostrils, and the air recyclers groaned in protest, fighting to clear the air.Well now, Amos said, thats fucking queer.The room was built on two levels: an upper catwalk a meter and a half wide, and a lower floor two meters below it.A wide passage led away at ten oclock on the lower level, and a door on the upper level stood open at one oclock.The pit below them was chaos.Blood soaked the walls and had sprayed up to stipple the ceiling.Bodies lay on the ground below them.
