What do you mean by this?she said.She gestured at the table, at his own annoyed scowl.What is wrong now?He stared at his coffee cup, looked up at her, then back down at the cup.It was impossible.A sentence was pronouncing itself in his mind, each word equally weighted: I illed John.Nothings wrong, he said.What do you mean?The corners of her mouth tightened, making her glare look contemptuous and her face old.Nearly eighty now.They were too old for this.After a long silence she sat down across from him.Look, she said slowly.I dont care what happened in the past.She stopped speaking, and he risked a glance at her; she was staring down, looking inward.What happened in the Ares, I mean, or in Underhill.Or any of it.His heart beat inside him like a child trying to escape.His lungs were cold.She was still talking, but he hadnt caught it.Did she know?Did she know what he had done in Nicosia?It was impossible, or she would not have been here (would she?); but she ought to have known.Do you understand?she asked.He hadnt heard what she was referring to.He continued to stare at his coffee cup, and suddenly she slapped it away with the back of her hand.It clattered under a nearby table and broke.The white ceramic semicircle of the handle spun on the ground.I said do you understand?Paralyzed, he continued to stare at the empty tabletop.Overlapping rings of brown coffee stains.Maya leaned forward and put her face in her hands.She was hunched tight over her stomach, not breathing.Finally she breathed, pulled her head up.No, she said, so quietly that at first he assumed she was addressing herself.Dont speak of it.You think I care, and so you do all this.As if I would care more about then than now.She looked up at him and caught his gaze.It was thirty years ago, she said.Over thirty five since we met, and thirty since all that happened.I am not that Maya Katarina Toitovna.I dont know her, I dont know what she thought or felt, or why.That was a different world, another life.It doesnt matter to me now.I have no feeling for it.Now I am here, and this is me.She poked herself between the breasts with a thumb.And look; I love you.She let the silence stretch, her last words drifting out like ripples on a pond.He couldnt stop looking at her; then he pulled his gaze away, he glared up at the faint twilight stars overhead, let their position seep into his memory.When she said I love you, Orion stood tall in the southern sky.The metal chair under you was hard.Your feet were cold.I dont want to think about anything but that, she said.She didnt know; and he did.But everyone has to assume their past somehow.They were nearly eighty years old, and healthy.There were people who were now 110 years old, healthy, vigorous, strong.Who knew how long it would last?They were going to have a lot of past to assume.And as it went on, and those years of their youth receded into the distant past, all those searing passions that had cut so deep...could they really be only scars?Werent they crippling wounds, a thousand amputations?But it wasnt a physical thing.Amputations, castrations, hollowing out; they were all in the imagination.An imaginary relationship to a real situation....The brain is a funny animal, he muttered.She cocked her head, looked curiously at him.Suddenly he was afraid; they were their pasts, they had to be or they were nothing at all, and whatever they felt or thought or said in the present was nothing more than an echo of the past; and so when they said what they said, how could they know what their deeper minds were really feeling, thinking, saying?They didnt know, not really.Relationships were for that reason utterly mysterious, they took place between two subconscious minds, and whatever the surface trickle thought was going on could not be trusted to be right.Did that Maya down at the deepest level know or not know, remember or forget, swear vengeance or forgive?There was no way of telling, he could never be sure.It was impossible.And yet there she was, sitting there miserably, looking as if he could shatter her like a coffee cup, shatter her with a single flick of his finger.If he didnt at least pretend to believe her, what then?What then?How could he shatter her like that?She would hate him for it for forcing her to remember the past, to care about it.And so...one had to go on, to act.He lifted his hand, so frightened that the movement felt like teleoperation.He was a dwarf in a waldo, a waldo that was stiff, touchy, unfamiliar: lift, quick modulate!To the left, hold; return, hold; steady.Down gently.Gently gently onto the back of her hand.Clasp, very gently.Her hand was really very cold; and so was his.She looked wanly at him.Lets He had to clear his throat.Lets go back to our rooms.For weeks after that he remained physically clumsy, as if he had withdrawn into some other space, and had to operate his body from a distance.Teleoperation.It made him aware of how many muscles he had.Sometimes he knew them so well he could snake through the air, but most of the time he jerked across the landscape like Frankensteins monster.Burroughs was flooded with bad news; life in the city seemed fairly normal, but the video screens piped in scenes of a world Frank could scarcely believe.Riots in Hellas; the domed crater New Houston declaring itself an independent republic; and that same week, Slusinski sent tape of an American orientation in which all five dorms had voted to leave for Hellas without the proper travel permits.Chalmers contacted the new UNOMA factor, and got a detachment of U. N.  security police to go there; and ten men arrested 500, by the simple expedient of overriding the tents physical plant computer and ordering the helpless occupants to board a series of train cars before the tents air was released.They had then been trained off to Korolyov, which was now in effect a prison city.Its transformation into a prison had become general knowledge sometime recently, it was hard to recall exactly when, as it had an air of already always about it, perhaps because the parts of a prison system had existed for several years, scattered planetwide.Chalmers interviewed some of the prisoners over their room videos, two or three at a time.You see how easy it was to detain you, he told them.Thats the way it will be all over.The life support systems are so fragile that theyre impossible to defend.Even on Earth advanced military technology makes a police state much more possible to implement than ever before, but here its absurdly easy.Well, you got us when it was easiest, replied a man in his sixties.Which was smart.Once we get free Id like to see you catch us.At that point your life support system is as vulnerable to us as ours is to you, and yours is more visible.You should know better than that!All life support here is hooked back ultimately to Earth.But they have a number of vast military powers at their disposal, and we dont.You and all your friends are trying to live out a fantasy rebellion, some kind of sci fi 1776, frontiersmen throwing off the yoke of tyranny, but it isnt like that here!The analogies are all wrong, and deceptively wrong because they mask the reality, the true nature of our dependence and their might.They keep you from seeing that its a fantasy!Im sure there was many a good Tory neighbor arguing the same case in the colonies, the man said with a grin.Actually the analogy is in many ways a good one.Were not just cogs in the machine here, were individual people, most of us ordinary, but theres some real characters too were going to see our Washingtons and Jeffersons and Paines, I guarantee you.Also the Andrew Jacksons and Forrest Mosebys, the brutal men who are good at getting what they want.This is ridiculous!Frank cried.Its a false analogy!Well, its more metaphor than analogy anyway.There are differences, but we intend to respond to those creatively.We wont be hefting muskets over rock walls to take potshots at you.Hefting mining lasers over crater walls?You think thats different?The man flicked at him, as if the camera in his room were a mosquito.I suppose the real question is, will we have a Lincoln?Lincoln is dead, Frank snapped.And historical analogy is the last refuge of people who cant grasp the current situation.He cut the connection.Reason was useless.Also anger, also sarcasm, not to mention irony.He could only try to match them in fantasyland.So he stood up in meetings and did his very best, haranguing them about what Mars was, how it had come to be, what a fine future it could have as a collective society, specifically and organically Martian in its nature, with the dross of all those Terran hatreds burnt away, all those dead habits that keep us from really living, from the creation that is the worlds only real beauty, damn it!Useless.He tried to arrange meetings with some of the disappeared, and once he talked with a group by phone, and asked them to pass the word along to Hiroko if possible, that he urgently needed to talk to her.But no one seemed to know where she was.Then one day he got a message from her, in print faxed down from Phobos.Hed be better off talking to Arkady, it said.But Arkady had disappeared while down in Hellas, and was no longer taking calls.Its like playing fucking hide and seek, Frank exclaimed bitterly to Maya one day.Did you have that game in Russia?I remember playing with some older kids one time, it was around sunset and a storm over the water making it really dark, and there I was, wandering around empty streets knowing Id never find any of them.Forget the disappeared, she advised.Concentrate on who you can see.The disappeared will be monitoring you anyway.It doesnt matter if you cant see them or if they dont reply.He shook his head.Then there was a new wave of emigration.He shouted for Slusinski and ordered him to get an explanation from Washington.Apparently, sir, the elevator consortium has been bought in a hostile takeover by Subarashii, so its assets are in Trinidad Tobago and it is no longer interested in responding to American concerns about the matter.Infrastructure construction capability is now in line with a moderate emigration rate, they say.Damn them!Frank said.They dont know what theyre doing with this!He walked in a circle, grinding his teeth.The words spilled quietly out of him, in a monologue of their own making.You see but you dont understand.Its like John used to say, theres parts of Martian reality that dont make it across the vacuum, not just the feel of the gravity, but the feel of getting up in a dorm and going down to the baths, and then across the alley to a dining hall.And so youre getting it all wrong, you arrogant, ignorant, stupid sons of bitches....He and Maya took the train from Burroughs back up to Pavonis Mons.All during the trip he sat by the window and watched the red landscape rise and fall, contract in to the flatland five kilometers and then, as they rose, extend out to forty kilometers, or a hundred.Such a big bulge in the planet, Tharsis.Something inside, breaking out.As in the current situation.Yes, they were stuck on the side of the Tharsis Bulge of Martian history, with the big volcanoes about to pop.And then there one was, Pavonis Mons, an enormous dream mountain, as if the world were a print by Hokusai.Frank found it difficult to talk.He avoided looking at the TV at the front of the car news flashed up and down the train almost instantly anyway, in snatches of overheard conversation or the looks on peoples faces.It was never necessary to watch the video to find out the really important news.The train ran through a forest of Acheron pines, tiny things with bark like black iron and cylindrical bushes of needles, but the needles were all yellow and drooping.He had heard about this, there was some kind of problem with the soil, too much salt or too little nitrogen, they werent sure.Helmeted figures stood around one on a ladder, plucking specimens of the sick needles.Thats me, Frank said to Maya under his breath, as she was asleep.Playing with needles when the roots are sick.In the Sheffield offices he started meeting with the new elevator administrators, at the same time beginning another round of simultaneous meetings with Washington.It turned out Phyllis was still in control of the elevator, having aided Subarashii in the hostile takeover.Then they heard that Arkady was in Nicosia, just down the slope from Pavonis, and that he and his followers had declared Nicosia a free city like New Houston.Nicosia had become a big jump off point for the disappeared.You could slip into Nicosia and never be heard of again, it had happened hundreds of times, so many that it was clear there was some system there, of contact and transmission, an underground railroad kind of thing that no undercover agent had yet been able to penetrate, or at least to return from.Lets go down there and talk to him, Frank said to Maya when he heard.I really want to confront him in person.It wont do any good, Maya said darkly.But Nadia was supposed to be there as well, and so she came along.All down the slope of Tharsis they rode in silence, watching the frosted rock fly by.At Nicosia the station opened for their train as if there was not even a question of refusing them.But Arkady and Nadia were not in the small crowd that greeted them; instead it was Alexander Zhalin.Back at the city managers offices, they called up Arkady on a vidlink; judging by the sunlight behind him, he was already many kilometers to the east.And Nadia, they said, had never been in Nicosia at all.Arkady looked the same as ever, expansive and relaxed.This is madness, Frank said to him, furious that he had not gotten him in person.You cant hope to succeed.But we can, Arkady said.We do.His luxuriant red and white beard was an obvious revolutionary badge, as if he were the young Fidel about to enter Havana.Of course it would be easier with your help, Frank.Think about it!Then before Frank could say more, someone off screen got Arkadys attention.A muttered conversation in Russian, and then Arkady faced him again.Sorry, Frank, he said.I must attend to something.Ill get back to you as soon as possible.Dont you go!Frank shouted, but the connection was gone.God damn it!Nadia came on the line.She was in Burroughs, but had been linked into the exchange, such as it was.In contrast to Arkady she was taut, brusque, unhappy.You cant support what hes doing!Frank cried.No, Nadia said grimly.We arent talking.We still have this phone contact, which is how I knew where you were, but we dont use it direct anymore.No point.You cant influence him?Maya said.No.Frank could see that this was hard for Maya to believe, and it almost made him laugh: not influence a man, not manipulate him?What was Nadias problem?That night they stayed at a dorm near the station.After supper Maya went back to the city managers office, to talk to Alexander and Dmitri and Elena.Frank wasnt interested, it was a waste of time.Restlessly he walked the circumference of the old town, through alleys running against the tent wall, remembering that night so long ago.Only nine years, in fact, though it felt like a hundred.Nicosia looked little these days.The park at the western apex still had a good view of the whole, but a blackness filled things so that he could scarcely see.In the sycamore grove, now mature, he passed a short man hurrying the other way.The man stopped and stared at Frank, who was under a street lamp.Chalmers!the man exclaimed.Frank turned.The man had a thin face, long tangled dreadlocks, dark skin.No one he knew.But seeing him, he felt a chill.Yes?he snapped.The man regarded him.He said, You dont know me, do you.No I dont.Who are you?The mans grin was asymmetrical, as if his face had been cracked at the point of the jaw.Underneath the streetlight it looked warped, half crazed.Who are you?Frank said again.The man raised a finger.The last time we met, you were bringing down the town.Tonight its my turn.Ha!He strode off laughing, each sharp Ha!higher than the last.Back at the city managers, Maya clutched his arm.I was worried, you shouldnt be walking around alone in this town!Shut up.He went to a phone and called the physical plant.Everything was normal.He called the UNOMA police, and told them to mount an armed guard at the plant and the train station.He was still repeating the order to someone higher up the chain of command, and it seemed likely it would go all the way up to the new factor for final confirmation, when the screen went blank.There was a tremor underfoot, and every alarm bell in town went off at once.A concerted, adrenal brinnnnng!Then there was a sharp jolt.The doors all hissed shut; the building was sealing, meaning pressures outside had made a rapid drop.He and Maya ran to the window and looked out.The tent over Nicosia was down, in some places stretched over the tallest rooftops like saran wrap, in others blowing away on the wind.People down on the street were pounding on doors, running, collapsing, huddled in on themselves like the bodies in Pompeii.Frank wheeled away, his teeth pounding with hot pain.Apparently the building had sealed successfully.Below all the noise Frank could hear or feel the hum of a generator.The video screens were blank, which had the effect of making it hard to believe the view out the window.Mayas face was pink, but her manner calm.The tent is down!I know.But what happened?He didnt reply.She was working away at the video screens.Have you tried the radio yet?No.Well?she cried, exasperated by his silence.Do you know whats going on?Revolution, he said.Part 7    Senzeni Na      On the fourteenth day of the revolution Arkady Bogdanov dreamed he and his father sat on a wooden box, before a small fire at the edge of the clearing a kind of campfire, except that the long low tin roofed buildings of Ugoly were just a hundred meters behind their backs.They had their bare hands extended to the radiant heat, and his father was once again telling the story of his encounter with the snow leopard.It was windy and the flames gusted.Then a fire alarm rang out behind them.It was Arkadys alarm, set for four A. M.  He got up and took a hot sponge bath.An image from the dream recurred to him.He had not slept much since the revolts beginning, just a few hours snatched here or there, and his alarm had awakened him from several deep sleep dreams, the kind one normally did not remember.Almost all had been undistorted memories of his childhood, memories never once recalled before.It made him wonder just how much the memory held, and if its storage might not be immensely more powerful than its retrieval mechanism.Might one be able to remember every second of ones life, but only in dreams that were always lost on waking?Might this be necessary, somehow?And if so, what would happen if people started living for two or three hundred years?Janet Blyleven came by, looking worried.Theyve blown up Nemesis.Roald has analyzed the video, and guesses they hit it with a bunch of hydrogen bombs.They went next door to Carrs big city offices, where Arkady had spent most of the previous two weeks.Alex and Roald were inside watching the TV.Roald said, Screen, replay tape one.An image flickered and held: black space, the thick net of stars, and midscreen a dark irregular asteroid, visible mostly as a patch of occluded stars.For a few moments the image held, and then a white light appeared on the side of the asteroid.The expansion and dispersal of the asteroid was immediate.Fast work, Arkady remarked.Theres another angle from a camera farther away.This clip showed the asteroid as oblong, and it was possible to make out the silver blisters of its mass driver.Then there was a white flash, and when the black sky returned the asteroid was gone; a shimmering of stars to the right of the screen indicated the passage of fragments, then they steadied and it was over.No fiery white cloud, no roar on the soundtrack; just a reporters tinny voice, chattering about the end of the Martian rioters doomsday threat, and the vindication of the concept of strategic defense.Although apparently the missiles had come from the Amex lunar base, launched by rail gun.I never did like the idea, Arkady said.It was mutual assured destruction all over again.Roald said, But if theres mutual assured destruction, and one side loses the capability ...We havent lost the capability here, though.And they value whats here as much as we do.So now were back to the Swiss defense.Destroy what they wanted and take to the hills, for resistance forever.It was more to his liking.Its weaker, Roald said bluntly.He had voted with the majority, in favor of sending Nemesis on its course toward the Earth.Arkady nodded.It couldnt be denied that one term had been erased from the equation.But it wasnt clear if the balance of power had changed or not.Nemesis had not been his idea; Mikhail Yangel had proposed it, and the group in the asteroids had carried it out on their own.Now a lot of them were dead, killed by the big explosion or by smaller ones out in the belt, while Nemesis itself had created the impression that the rebels would countenance mass destruction on Earth.A bad idea, as Arkady had pointed out.But that was life in a revolution.No one was in control, no matter what people said.And for the most part it was better that way, especially here on Mars.Fighting had been severe in the first week, UNOMA and the transnationals had beefed up their security forces in the previous year.A lot of the big cities had been instantly seized by them, and it might have happened everywhere except that there turned out to be so many more rebel groups than they or anyone else had known about.Over sixty towns and stations had gotten on the net and declared independence, they had popped out of the labs and the hills and simply taken over.And now with Earth on the far side of the sun, and the nearest continuous shuttle destroyed, it was the security forces who were looking under siege, big cities or not.A call came from the physical plant.They were having some trouble with the computers, and wanted Arkady to come have a look.He left the city offices and walked across Menlo Park to the plant.It was just after sunrise, and most of Carr Crater was still in shadow.Only the west wall and the tall concrete buildings of the physical plant were in sunlight at this hour, their walls all yellow in the raw morning light, the pistes running up the crater wall like gold ribbons.In the shadowed streets the city was just waking.A lot of rebels had come in from other towns or the cratered highlands, and they slept on the park grass.People sat up, sleeping bags still draped over their legs, eyes puffy, hair wild.Night temperatures were being kept up, but it was still cool at dawn, and those out of their bags crouched around stoves, blowing into their hands and puttering with coffee pots and samovars, and checking to the west to see how close the line of sunlight had crept.When they saw Arkady they waved, and more than once he was stopped by people who wanted to get his opinion of the news, or give him advice.Arkady answered them all cheerfully.Again he felt that difference in the air, the sense that they were all in a new space together, everyone facing the same problems, everyone equal, everyone (seeing a heating coil glowing under a coffee pot) incandescent with the electricity of freedom.He walked feeling lighter, chattering into his wristpads diary file as he went.The park reminds me of what Orwell said about Barcelona in the hands of the anarchists it is the euphoria of a new social contract, of a return to that childs dream of fairness we all began with  His wristpad beeped and Phylliss face appeared on the tiny screen, which was annoying.What do you want?he asked.Nemesis is gone.We want you to surrender before any more damage is done.Its simple now, Arkady.Surrender or die.He almost laughed.She was like the wicked witch in the Oz movie, appearing unexpectedly in his crystal ball.Its no laughing matter!she exclaimed.Suddenly he saw that she was scared.You know we had nothing to do with Nemesis, he said.It is irrelevant.How can you be such a fool!she cried.It is not foolishness.Listen, you tell your masters this if they try to subdue the free cities here, we will destroy everything on Mars.That was the Swiss defense.Do you think that matters?She was white lipped, her tiny image like a primitive fury mask.It matters.Look, Phyllis, Im only the polar cap of this, theres a massive underground lens that you cant see.Its really vast, and theyve got the means to strike back at you if they want.She must have let her arm fall, because the image on his little screen swung wildly, then showed a floor.You were always a fool, her disembodied voice said.Even back on the Ares.The connection went dead.Arkady walked on, the citys bustle no longer as exhilarating as it had been.If Phyllis were frightened ...At the physical plant they were busy running a malfunction search.A couple of hours before, oxygen levels in the city had begun to rise, and no warning lights had gone off.A tech had discovered it accidentally.Half an hours work and they found it.A program had been substituted.They replaced it, but Tati Anokhin was not happy.Look, that had to be sabotage, and theres still more oxygen than even this accounts for.Look, its nearly forty percent out there right now.No wonder everyone is in such a good mood this morning.Im not.Besides that mood thing is a myth.Are you sure?Go through the programming again, and look at the encryption IDs, and see if there are any other substitutions hidden under this one.He headed back to the city offices.He was halfway there when there was a loud pop overhead.He looked up and saw a small hole in the dome.The air suddenly took on an iridescent shimmer, as if they were inside a great soap bubble.A bright flash and a loud boom knocked him to his feet.Struggling back up, he saw everything ignite simultaneously; people were burning like torches; and right before his eyes his arm caught fire.It was not hard to destroy Martian towns.No harder than breaking a window, or popping a balloon.Nadia Cherneshevsky discovered this while holed up in the city offices of Lasswitz, a tent town which had been punctured one night just after sunset.All the surviving occupants were now huddled in the city offices or the physical plant.For three days they had spent their time going out to try to repair the tent, and watching TV to try and figure out what was going on.But the Terran news packages were concerned with its own wars, which seemed to be coalescing into one.Only infrequently was there a brief report on the wrecked Martian towns.One said that many domed craters had been hit by missiles from over the horizon, usually in a sequence where oxygen or aerated fuels were introduced and then quickly followed by an ignitor that caused explosions of varying severity from antipersonnel fires, to blasts that blew the domes off, to really big explosions that in effect re excavated the crater.Antipersonnel oxygen fires appeared to be the most common; these left the infrastructure intact, for the most part.Tent towns were simpler still.Most of them had been punctured by Phobos based lasers; some had had their physical plants targeted by guided cruise missiles; others had been invaded by troops of one kind or another, their spaceports seized, armored rovers crashing through city walls, and in rare cases rocketpack paratroopers descending from above.Nadia watched the jiggling video images that so clearly revealed the fear of the camera operators, her stomach collapsing to a tight walnut inside her.What are they doing, testing methods?she cried.I doubt it, said Yeli Zudov.Its probably just a matter of different groups using different methods.Some look like theyre trying to do as little damage as possible, others seem to want to kill as many of us as they can.Make more room for emigration.Nadia turned away, sickened.She got up and took off for the kitchen, bent slightly over her collapsed stomach, desperate to do something.In the kitchen they had turned on a generator and were microwaving frozen dinners.She helped hand them out, moving up and down a line of people sitting in the hall outside.Unwashed faces, splashed with black frostnip blisters: some people talked animatedly, others sat like statues, or slept leaning against each other.Most of them had been residents of Lasswitz, but a good number had driven in from tents or hideouts that had been destroyed from space, or attacked by ground forces.Is stupid, an old Arab woman was saying to a gnarled little man.My parents were Red Crescent in Baghdad when the Americans bombed it, if they have the sky is nothing you can do, nothing!We have to surrender.Surrender as soon as possible!But to whom?the little man asked wearily.And for whom?And how?To anyone, from everybody, and by radio, of course!The woman glared at Nadia, who shrugged.Then her wristpad beeped, and Sasha Yefremov babbled in a tinny wristphone voice.The water station north of town had gone up in an explosion, and the well it had capped was now fountaining in an artesian eruption of water and ice.Ill be right there, Nadia said, shocked.The towns water station tapped the lower end of the Lasswitz aquifer, which was a big one.If any significant part of the aquifer broached the surface, the water station and the town and the entire canyon they lay in would disappear in a catastrophic flood and worse, Burroughs was located only 200 kilometers down the slope of Syrtis and Isidis, and the flood could very conceivably run that far.Burroughs!Its population was far too large to evacuate, especially now that it had become a refuge for people escaping the war; there was simply no other place to go.Surrender!the Arab woman insisted from the hall.All surrender!I dont think that will work anymore, Nadia said, and ran for the buildings lock.A part of her was immensely relieved to be able to do something, to stop huddling in a building watching disasters on TV, and do something.And Nadia had platted and overseen the construction of Lasswitz, only six years before, so now she had an idea what to do.The town was a Nicosia class tent, with the farm and physical plant in separate structures, and the water station well off to the north.All the structures were down on the floor of a big east west rift called Arena Canyon, the walls of which were nearly vertical and half a kilometer high.The water station was located only a couple hundred meters from the canyons north wall, which in that area had an impressive overhang at the top.As Nadia drove with Sasha and Yeli to the water station, she quickly outlined her plan: I think we can bring down the cliff onto the station, and if we can, the landslide ought to be enough to cap the leak.Wont the flood just carry the landslides rock away?Sasha asked.It will if its a full aquifer outbreak, sure.But if we cover it when its still just an uncapped well, then the escaping water will freeze in the landslide, and hopefully form a dam heavy enough to hold it.Hydrostatic pressure in this aquifer is only a bit greater than the lithostatic pressure of the rock over it, so the artesian flow isnt all that high.If it were wed be dead already.She braked the rover.Out the windshield they could see the remains of the water station, under a cloud of thin frost steam.A rover came bouncing full speed toward them, and Nadia flashed their headlights and turned the radio to the common band.It was the water station crew, a couple named Angela and Sam, rabid with the adventures of the last hour.When they had driven alongside and finished their story, Nadia explained to them what she had in mind.It could work, Angela said.Certainly nothing else will stop it now, its really pumping.Well have to hurry, Sam said.Its eating the rock at an unbelievable rate.If we dont cap it, Angela said with a certain morbid enthusiasm, itll look like when the Atlantic first broke through the Straits of Gibraltar and flooded the Mediterranean basin.That was a waterfall that lasted ten thousand years.I never heard of that one, Nadia said.Come on with us to the cliff and help us get the robots going.During the ride over she had directed all the towns construction robots from their hangar to the foot of the north wall, next to the water station; when the two rovers got there, they found a few of the faster robots had already arrived, and the rest were grinding over the canyon floor toward them.There was a small talus slope at the foot of the cliff, which towered over them like an enormous frozen wave, gleaming in the noon light.Nadia linked into the earthmovers and bulldozers and gave them instructions to clear paths through the talus; when that was done, tunnelers would bore straight into the cliff.See, Nadia said, pointing at an areological map of the canyon that she had called onto the rovers screen, theres a big fault there behind that whole overhanging piece.Its causing the lip of the wall to slump a bit see that slightly lower shelf at the top?If we set off all the explosives weve got at the bottom of that fault, its sure to bring down the overhang, dont you think?I dont know, Yeli said.Its worth a try.The slower robots arrived, bringing an array of explosives left over from the excavation of the towns foundation.Nadia went to work programming the vehicles to tunnel into the bottom of the cliff, and for most of an hour she was lost to the world.When she was finished she said, Lets get back to town and get everyone evacuated.I cant be sure how much of the cliff might come down, and we dont want to bury everyone.Weve got four hours.Jesus, Nadia!Four hours.She typed in the last command and started up their rover.Angela and Sam followed with a cheer.You dont seem very sorry to leave, Yeli said to them.Hell, it was boring!Angela said.I dont think thats going to be much of a problem anymore.The evacuation was difficult.A lot of the towns occupants didnt want to leave, and there was barely room for them in the rovers at hand.Finally they were all stuffed into one vehicle or another, and off on the transponder road to Burroughs.Lasswitz was empty.Nadia spent an hour trying to contact Phyllis by satellite phone, but the comm channels were disrupted by what sounded like a number of different jamming efforts.Nadia left a message on the satellite itself: Were noncombatants in Syrtis Major, trying to stop the Lasswitz aquifer from flooding Burroughs.So leave us alone!A surrender of sorts.Nadia and Sasha and Yeli were joined in their rover by Angela and Sam, and they drove up the steep switchbacks of the cliff road, onto the south rim of Arena Canyon.Across from them was the imposing north wall; below to the left lay the town, looking almost normal; but to the right it was clear something was wrong.The water station was broken in the middle by a thick white geyser, which plumed like a broken fire hydrant, and then fell into a jumble of dirty red white ice blocks.This weird mass shifted even as they watched, briefly exposing black flowing water which frost steamed madly, white mists pouring out of the black cracks and then whipping down canyon on the wind.The rock and fines of the Martian surface were so dehydrated that when water splashed onto them they seemed to explode in violent chemical reactions, so when the water ran over dry ground, great clouds of dust fired off into the air and joined the frost steam swirling off the water.Sax will be pleased, Nadia said grimly.At the appointed hour, four plumes of smoke shot out of the base of the northern wall.For several seconds nothing else happened, and the observers groaned.Then the cliff face jerked, and the rock of the overhang slipped down, slowly and majestically.Thick clouds of smoke shot up from the bottom of the cliff, and then sheets of ejecta shot out, like water from under a calving iceberg.A low roar shook their rover, and Nadia cautiously backed it away from the south rim.Just before a massive cloud of dust cut off their view, they saw the water station covered by the swift tumbling edge of the landslide.Angela and Sam had been cheering.How will we tell if its worked?Sasha asked.Wait till we can see it again, Nadia said.Hopefully the flood downstream will have gone white.No more open water, no more movement.Sasha nodded.They sat looking down into the ancient canyon, waiting.Nadias mind was mostly blank; the thoughts that did occur to her were bleak.She needed more action like the last few hours, the kind of intense activity that gave her no time to think; even a moments pause and the whole miserable situation crashed back in on her, the wrecked cities, the dead everywhere, Arkadys disappearance.And no one in control, apparently.No plan to any of it.Police troops were wrecking towns to stop the rebellion, and rebels were wrecking towns to keep the rebellion alive.It would end with everything destroyed, her whole lifes work blown up before her eyes; and for no reason!No reason at all.She couldnt afford to think.Down there a landslide had overrun a water station, hopefully, and the water rushing up the well had been blocked and frozen, making a composite dam.After that it was hard to say.If the hydrostatic pressure in the aquifer was high enough, a new breakout might be forced.But if the dam were thick enough...Well, nothing to be done about it.Although if they could create some kind of escape valve, to take the pressure off the landslide dam ...Slowly the wind tattered the dust away.Her companions cheered; the water station was gone, covered by a fresh black landslide that spilled out from the northern wall, which now had a big new arc in its rim.But it had been a close thing, not anywhere near as big a landslide as she would have hoped.Lasswitz itself was still there, and it appeared that the layer of rock over the water station was not all that thick.The flood seemed to have stopped, it was true; it was motionless, a chunky, dirty white swath, like a glacier running down the middle of the canyon.And there was very little frost steam rising from it.Still ...Lets go back down to Lasswitz and look at the aquifer monitors, Nadia said.They drove back down the canyon wall road and into Lasswitzs garage.They walked down the empty streets in walkers and helmets.The aquifer study center was located next to the city offices.It was odd to see their refuge of the last few days empty.Inside the aquifer center they studied the readouts from the array of underground sensors.A lot of them were no longer functioning, but those that were showed that hydrostatic pressure inside the aquifer was higher than ever before, and increasing.As if to emphasize the point a small temblor shook the ground, vibrating the soles of their boots.None of them had ever felt such a thing on Mars before.Shit!Yeli said, its going to blow again for sure!We have to drill a runoff well, Nadia said.A kind of pressure valve.But what if it breaks out like the main one?Sasha asked.If we put it at the upper end of the aquifer, or midway so that it takes some flow, it should be fine.Just as good as the old water station, which someone probably blew up, or else it would still be working fine.She shook her head bitterly.We have to risk it.If it works, it works.If it doesnt, then maybe we cause an outbreak.But if we dont do something, it looks like therell be an outbreak anyway.She led the little group down the main street to the robot warehouse in the garage, and sat down in the command center to begin programming again.A standard drilling operation, with maximum blowout baffling.The water would come to the surface under artesian pressure, and then they would direct it into a pipeline, which they would instruct a robot crew to lay in some direction that would take it out of the Arena Canyon region.She and the others studied topographic maps, and ran simulated floods down several canyons paralleling Arena to north and south.They found that the watershed was huge, everything on Syrtis drained down toward Burroughs, the land was a big bowl here.They would have to pipe the water north for nearly 300 kilometers to get it into the next watershed.Look, Yeli said, released into the Nili Fossae, it will run straight north onto Utopia Planitia, and freeze on the northern dunes.Sax must be loving this revolution, Nadia said again.Hes getting stuff they never would have approved.But a lot of his projects must be getting wrecked too, Yeli pointed out.I bet its still a net gain, in Saxs terms.All this water on the surface ...Well have to ask him.If we ever see him again.Yeli was silent.Then he said, Is it that much water, really?Its not just Lasswitz, Sam said.I saw a news bit a while ago theyve broken the Lowell aquifer, a big breakout like the ones that cut the outflow channels.Itll rip billions of kilos of regolith downslope, and I dont know how much water.Its unbelievable.But why?Nadia said.Its the best weapon they have, I guess.Not much of a weapon!They cant aim it or stop it!No.But neither can anyone else.And think about it all the towns downslope from Lowell are gone Franklin, Drexler, Osaka, Galileo, I imagine even Silverton.And all those were transnational towns.A lot of channel mining towns are vulnerable, I should think.So both sides are attacking the infrastructure, Nadia said dully.Thats right.She had to work, there was no other choice.She got them going again on robot programming, and they spent the rest of that day and the next getting the robot teams out to the drilling site, and making sure the start up went right.The drilling was straightforward; it was only a matter of making sure that pressures in the aquifer didnt cause a blowout.And the pipeline to transfer the water north was even simpler, an operation that had been fully automated for years; but they doubled up on all the equipment, just to make sure.Up the north canyon roadbed, and on northward from there.No need to include pumps; artesian pressure would regulate the flow quite nicely, because when the pressure dropped low enough to stop pushing water out of the canyon, the danger of a breakout at the lower end would presumably be past.So when the mobile magnesium mills were grinding along, scooping up fines and making pipe, and when the forklifts and frontloaders were taking these pipe segments to the assembler, and when that great moving building was taking in the segments and extruding pipe behind it as it rolled slowly along up the road, and when another mobile behemoth was going over the completed pipe, and wrapping it in aerolattice insulation made from tailings from the refinery; and when the first segment of the pipeline was heated and running then they declared the system operational, and hoped it would make it 300 kilometers farther.The pipeline would be built at about a kilometer an hour, for twenty four and a half hours a day; so if all went well, about twelve days to Nili Fossae.At that rate the pipeline would be done very soon after the well was drilled and ready.And if the landslide dam held that long, then they would have their pressure valve.So Burroughs was safe, or as safe as they could make it by their efforts.They could go.But it was a question what their destination should be.Nadia sat slumped over a microwaved dinner, watching a Terran news show, listening to her companions debate the issue.Horrible how the revolution was being portrayed on Earth: extremists, communists, vandals, saboteurs, reds, terrorists.Never the words rebel or revolutionary, words of which half the Earth (at least) might approve.No, they were isolated groups of insane, destructive terrorists.And it didnt help Nadias mood that there was, she felt, some truth to the description; it only made her angrier.We should join whoever we can, and help fight!Angela said.Im not fighting anyone, Nadia said mulishly.Its stupid.I wont do it.Ill fix things where I can, but I wont fight.A message came over the radio.Fournier Crater, about 860 kilometers away, had a cracked dome.The populace was trapped in sealed buildings, and running out of air.I want to go there, Nadia said.Theres a big central warehouse of construction robots there.They could fix the dome, and then be set to other repairs down on Isidis.How will you get there?Sam asked.Nadia thought it over, took a deep breath.Ultralite, I guess.Theres some of those new 16Ds up on the south rim airstrip.That would be the fastest way for sure, and maybe even the safest, who knows.She looked at Yeli and Sasha.Will you fly with me?Yes, Yeli said.Sasha nodded.We want to come with you, Angela said.Itll be safer with two planes anyway.They took two planes that had been built by Spencers aeronautic factory in Elysium, the latest things, called simply 16Ds, ultralite delta winged four seat turbojets, made mostly of areogel and plastics, dangerous to fly because they were so light.But Yeli was an expert flier and Angela said she was too, so they climbed into two of them the next morning, after spending the night in the empty little airport, and taxied out to the packed dirt runway and took off directly into the sun.It took them a long time to rise to a thousand meters.The planet below looked deceptively normal, its old harsh face only a bit whiter on the north faces, as if aged by its parasite infestation.But then they flew out over Arena Canyon, and saw running down it a dirty glacier, a river of broken ice blocks.The glacier widened frequently where the flood had pooled for a time.The ice blocks were sometimes pure white, but more often stained one Martian shade or other, then broken and tumbled into a mix, so that the glacier was a shattered mosaic of frozen brick, sulfur, cinnamon, coal, cream, blood...spilling down the flat bed of the canyon all the way to the horizon, some seventy five kilometers away.Nadia asked Yeli if they could fly north and inspect the land that the robots were going to build the pipeline over.Soon after they turned they received a weak radio message on the first hundred band, from Ann Clayborne and Simon Frazier.They were trapped in Peridier Crater, which had lost its dome.It was to the north also, so they were already on the right course.The land they crossed that morning appeared negotiable to the robot team; it was flat, and though littered with ejecta, there were no little stopper escarpments.Farther on in this region the Nili Fossae began, very gradually at first, just four very shallow depressions, curving down to the northeast like the fingertips of a faint handprint.A hundred kilometers farther north, however, and they were parallel chasms each 500 meters deep, separated by dark land that had been heavily bashed by craters a kind of lunar configuration, reminding Nadia of a messy construction site.Farther north still, they got a surprise: where the easternmost canyon debouched onto Utopia, there was another aquifer outbreak.At its upper end it was simply a new slump, a big bowl of land shattered like a broken plate of glass; lower down, patches of frosting black and white water surged right out of the broken land, ripping at the new blocks and carrying them away even as they watched, in a steaming flood that caused the land it touched to explode.This shocking wound was at least thirty kilometers across, and ran right over the horizon to the north, with no sign of dissipating.Nadia stared at the sight and asked Yeli to fly nearer.I want to avoid the steam, Yeli said, absorbed in the sight himself.Most of the white frost cloud was blowing east and falling down onto the landscape, but the wind was fitful, and sometimes the thin white veil would rise straight up, obscuring the swath of black water and white ice.The outflow was as big as one of the big Antarctic glaciers, or even bigger.Cutting the red landscape in two.That is a hell of a lot of water, Angela said.Nadia switched to the first hundred band, and called Ann down in Peridier.Ann, do you know about this?She described what they were flying over.And its still running, the ice is moving, and we can see patches of open water, it looks black or sometimes red, you know.Can you hear it?Just sort of like a ventilator hum, and some cracks and pops from the ice, yeah.But were pretty loud up here ourselves.Hell of a lot of water!Well, Ann said, that aquifer isnt very big compared to some.How are they breaking them open?Can people really break those open?Some of them, Ann said.The ones with hydrostatic pressure greater than lithostatic pressure are in essence lifting the rock up, and its the permafrost layer that is forming a kind of dam, an ice dam.If you drilled a well and blew it up, or if you melted it ...But how?Reactor meltdown.Angela whistled.But the radiation!Nadia cried.Sure.But have you looked at your counter lately?I figure three or four of them must have gone.Wow!Angela cried.And thats just so far.Anns voice had that distant, dead tone it took on when she was angry.She answered their questions about the flood very briefly.A flood that big caused extreme pressure fluctuations; bedrock was smashed, then plucked away, and it was all swept downstream in a pulverizing rush, a ripping, gaseous, boulder filled slurry.Are you going to come over to Peridier?she asked when their questions trailed off.Were just turning east now, Yeli replied.I wanted to get a visual fix on Crater Fv first.Good idea.They flew on.The astounding roil of the flood dropped beneath the horizon, and they flew over the familiar old stone and sand again.Soon Peridier appeared over the horizon ahead, a low, much eroded crater wall.Its dome was gone, tattered sheets of the fabric thrown aside, still rolling this way and that over the crater rampart, as if a seed pod had burst.The piste running south reflected the sun like a silver thread.They flew over the arc of the crater wall, and Nadia peered down at the dark buildings through binoculars, cursing in a low Slavic chant.How?Who?Why?There was no way to tell.They flew on to the airstrip out on the far crater rampart.None of the hangars was working, and they had to suit up and drive some little cars over the rim into town.All the surviving occupants of Peridier were holed up in the physical plant.Nadia and Yeli went through its lock and gave Ann and Simon a hug, and then they were introduced to the others.There were about forty of them, living off emergency supplies, struggling to balance the gas exchange in the sealed buildings.What happened?Angela asked them, and they told the story in a kind of Greek chorus, interrupting each other frequently: a single explosion had burst the dome like a balloon, causing an instantaneous decompression that had also blown up many of the towns buildings.Luckily the physical plant was reinforced, and had withstood the internal pressures of its own air supply; and those inside had survived.Those out on the streets, or in the other buildings, had not.Wheres Peter?Yeli asked, startled and fearful.Hes on Clarke, Simon said quickly.He called us right after this all began.Hes been trying to get a spot on one of the elevators down, but its all police at this point, I guess there were a lot of them in orbit.Hell get down when he can.Its safer up there right now anyway, so Im not in that much of a hurry to see him.This made Nadia think of Arkady again.But there was nothing to be done, and quickly she set herself to the task of rebuilding Peridier.She first asked the survivors what their plans were, and when they shrugged, she suggested that they start by setting up a much smaller tent than the dome had been, using tenting material stored in the construction warehouses out at the airport.There were a lot of older robots mothballed out there, and so reconstruction would be possible without too much preliminary tooling.The occupants were enthusiastic; they had not known about the contents of the airport warehouses.Nadia shook her head at this.Its in all the records, she said to Yeli later, they only had to ask.They just werent thinking.They were just watching the TV, watching and waiting.Well, its a shock to have a dome go like that, Nadia.They had to make sure the building was secure first.I guess.But there were very few engineers or construction specialists among them.They were mostly escarpment areologists, or miners.Basic construction was something that robots did, or so they seemed to think.It was hard to say how long they would have gone before they would have started in on the reconstruction themselves, but with Nadia there to point out what could be done, and drive them with a brief burst of withering scorn at their inactivity, they were soon under way.Nadia worked eighteen and twenty hours a day for a few days, and got a foundation wall laid, and tenting cranes into action over the rooftops; after that it was mostly a matter of supervision.Restlessly Nadia asked her companions from Lasswitz if they would join her in the planes again.They agreed, and so about a week after their arrival they took off again, with Ann and Simon joining them in Angela and Sams plane.As they flew south, down the slope of Isidis toward Burroughs, a coded message clittered abruptly over their radio speakers.Nadia dug through her pack and found a bag of stuff Arkady had given her, including a bunch of files.She found the one she wanted and plugged it into the planes AI, and they ran the message through Arkadys decryption program.After a few seconds the AI spoke the message in its even tones:  UNOMA is in possession of Burroughs, and detaining everyone who comes here.There was silence in the two planes, winging south through the empty pink sky.Below them the plain of Isidis sloped down to the left.Ann said, Lets go there anyway.We can tell them in person to stop the assaults.No, Nadia replied.I want to be able to work.And if they lock us up...Besides, why do you think theyd listen to what we tell them about the assaults?No answer from Ann.Can we make it to Elysium?Nadia asked Yeli.Yes.So they turned east, and ignored radio queries from Burroughs air traffic control.They wont come after us, Yeli said with assurance.Look, the satellite radar shows theres a lot of planes up and around, too many to go after all of them.And it would be a waste of time anyway, because I suspect most of them are decoys.Someones sent up a whole lot of drones, which confuses the issue nicely as far as were concerned.Someone really put a lot of effort into this, Nadia muttered as she looked at the radar image.Five or six objects were glowing in the southern quadrant.Was it you, Arkady?Did you hide that much from me?She thought of that radio transmitter of his, which she had just run across in her bag.Or maybe it wasnt hidden.Maybe I just didnt want to see it.They flew to Elysium and landed next to South Fossa, the largest roofed canyon of them all.They found that the roof was still there, but only, it turned out, because the city had been depressurized before it had been punctured.So the inhabitants were trapped in any number of intact buildings, and trying to keep the farm alive.There had been an explosion at the physical plant, and several others in the town itself.So there was a lot of work to be done, but there was a good base for a quick recovery, and a more enterprising population than the group in Peridier.So Nadia threw herself into it as before, determined to fill every waking moment with work.She could not stand to be idle; she worked every moment she was awake, her old jazz tunes running through her mind nothing appropriate, there was no jazz or blues appropriate to this it was all completely incongruous, On the Sunny Side of the Street, Pennies from Heaven, A Kiss to Build a Dream On.And in those hectic days on Elysium she began to realize just how much power the robots had.In all her years of construction she had never really tried to exert that power to the full; there simply had been no need.But now there were hundreds of jobs to be done, more than could be accomplished even with a total effort, and so she took the system right out to the bleeding edge as programmers would say, and saw just how much that effort could do, even as she tried to figure out how to do more.She had always considered teleoperation to be a basically local procedure, for instance, but it wasnt necessarily so.Using relay satellites she could drive a bulldozer in the other hemisphere, and now, whenever she could establish a good link, she did so.She did not stop working for even a single waking second; she worked as she ate, she read reports and programs in the bathroom, and she never slept except when exhaustion knocked her out.While in this timeless state she told anyone and everyone she worked with what to do, without regard for their opinion or comfort; and in the face of her monomaniacal concentration, and the authority of her grasp of the situation, people obeyed her.Despite all this effort, they could not do enough.It always came back to Nadia, and she alone through the sleepless hours gave the system a full stretch, out on the bleeding edge all the time.And Elysium had a huge fleet of construction robots already built, so that it was possible to attack most of the pressing problems simultaneously.Most of those were located among the canyons on Elysiums western slope.All the roofed canyons had been broken open to one degree or another, but most of their physical plants were untouched, and there were a great number of survivors hunkered down in individual buildings running on emergency generators, as in South Fossa.When South Fossa was covered and heated and pumped up, she directed teams to go out and find all the survivors on the western slope, and they were pulled out of the other canyons and brought to South, and then sent back out with jobs to do.The roofing crews moved from canyon to canyon, and their ex occupants went to work underneath, readying for the pump ups.At that point Nadia turned her attention to other matters, programming toolmakers, starting robot linemen along the broken pipelines from Chasma Borealis.Who did all this?she said with disgust, staring one night at the TVs image of burst water pipes.The question was torn out of her; in reality she didnt want to know.She didnt want to think about the bigger picture, about anything but that pipeline there, broken on the dunes.But Yeli took her at her word, and said, Its hard to tell.The Terran news programs are all about Earth now, theres only an occasional clip from here, and they dont know what to make of it either.Apparently the next few shuttles are bringing U. N.  troops, who are supposed to restore order.But most of the news is about Earth the Middle East war, the Black Sea, Africa, you name it.A lot of the Southern Club is bombing flag of convenience countries, and the Group of Seven has declared theyre going to defend them.And theres a biological agent loose in Canada and Scandinavia  And maybe here too, Sasha interrupted.Did you see that clip of Acheron?Something happened there, the windows of the habitat are all blown out, and the land underneath the fin is covered with these growths of God knows what, no one wants to get near enough to find out....Nadia closed her mind to their talk, and concentrated on the problem of the pipeline.When she returned to real time, she found that every single robot she could find was in action reconstituting the towns, and the factories were busily pumping out more bulldozers, earthmovers, dump trucks, backhoes, frontloaders, steamrollers, framers, foundation diggers, welders, cement makers, plastic makers, roofers, everything.The system was at full pump, and there wasnt enough to occupy her anymore.And so she told the others she wanted to take off again, and Ann and Simon and Yeli and Sasha decided to accompany her; Angela and Sam had met friends in South Fossa, and were going to stay.So the five climbed into their two planes, and took off again.This was the way it would happen everywhere, Yeli asserted; whenever members of the first hundred encountered each other, they would not separate.They headed in the two planes south, toward Hellas.Passing over Tyrrhena Mohole, next to Hadriaca Patera, they landed briefly; the mohole town was punctured, and needed help to start the rebuilding.There were no robots on hand, but Nadia had found she could start an operation with as small a seed as her programs, a computer, and an air miner.That kind of spontaneous generation of machinery was another aspect of their power.It was slower, no doubt of that.Still, within a month these three components together would have conjured obedient beasts out of the sand: first the factories, then the assembly plants, then the construction robots themselves, vehicles as big and articulated as a city block, doing their work in their absence.It really was confounding, their new power.And yet all of it was as nothing in the face of human destructiveness.The five travelers flew from ruin to ruin, becoming numb to the damage and to the dead.Not that they were insensible to their own danger; after passing over a number of wrecked planes in the Hellas Elysium flight corridor, they switched to night flights.These were more dangerous than day flights in many ways, but Yeli was more comfortable with their level of stealth.The 16Ds were nearly invisible to radar, and would leave only the faintest traces on the most powerful tight focus IR detectors.All of them were willing to take the risk of that minute exposure.Nadia didnt care at all, she would have been happy to fly by day.She lived in the moment as much as she could, but her thoughts ran in circles as she kept trying to drag them back to the moment.Stunned by the waste of all that had been destroyed, she was becoming far distanced from her emotions.She only wanted to work.And Ann, some part of Nadia noticed, was worse.Of course she must have been worried about Peter.And then all the destruction as well for Ann it was not the structures but the land itself, the floods, the mass wasting, the snow, the radiation.And she had no work to distract her.Her work would have been the study of the damage.And so she did nothing, or tried to help Nadia when she could, moving around like an automaton.Day after day they worked at initiating the repair of one ruined structure or another, a bridge, a pipeline, a well, a power station, a piste, a town.They lived in what Yeli called Waldo World, ordering robots about as if they were slavemasters or magicians, or gods; and the machines went to work, trying to reverse the film of time and make broken things fly back together.With the luxury of haste they could be sloppy, and it was incredible how fast they could initiate construction, and then fly on.In the beginning was the word, Simon said wearily one evening, punching at his wristpad.A bridge crane swung across the setting sun.And then they were off again.They started up containment and burial programs for three blown reactors, staying safely over the horizon and working by teleoperation.While watching the operations, Yeli sometimes switched channels and had a look at the news.Once the shot was from orbit: a full disk shot of the Tharsis hemisphere, in daytime for all but the western limb.From that height they could see no sign of the outflows.But the voice over claimed they had occurred in all the old outflow channels that ran north from Marineris into Chryse, and the image jumped to a telescopic shot, which showed whitish pink bands in that region.Canals at last, of a sort.Nadia snapped the TV back to their work.So much destroyed, so many people killed, people who might have lived a thousand years and, of course, no word of Arkady.It had been twenty days now.People were saying he might have been forced into complete hiding, to avoid being killed by a strike from orbit.But Nadia no longer believed this, except in moments of extreme desire and pain, the two emotions surging up through the obsessive work mode in a brand new mixture, a new feeling that she hated and feared: desire causing pain, pain causing desire a hot fierce desire, that things not be as they were.How painful such a desire was!But if she worked hard enough, there was no time for it.No time to think or feel.They flew over the bridge spanning Harmakhis Vallis, on the eastern border of Hellas.It was down.Repair robots were cached in endhouses on all major bridges, and these could be adapted to total reconstruction of the spans, although they would be slow at it.The travelers got them going, and that evening, after finishing the last programs, they sat down to microwaved spaghetti in the planes cabins, and Yeli turned on the Terran TV channel again.There was nothing but static and a snaking, destroyed image.He tried switching channels, but all the channels were the same.Dense, buzzing static.Have they blown up Earth too?Ann said.No no, Yeli said.Someones jamming it.The sun is between us and it, these days, and you would only have to interfere with a few relay satellites to cut contact.They stared glumly at the fizzing screen.In recent days the local areosynchronous communications satellites had been going down left and right, shut down or sabotaged, it was impossible to say.Now, without the Terran news, they would really be in the dark.Surface to surface radio was limited indeed, given the tight horizons and the lack of an ionosphere not much more range than walker intercoms, really.Yeli tried a variety of stochastic resonance patterns, to see if he could cut through the jamming.The signals were scrambled beyond repair.He gave up with a grunt, punched out a search program.The radio oscillated up and down through the hertz, gathering static and stopping at the occasional faint punctuation: coded clicking, irretrievable snatches of music.Ghost voices gabbling in unrecognizable languages, as if Yeli had succeeded where SETI had failed, and finally, now that it was pointless, gotten messages from the stars.Probably just stuff from the asteroid miners.In any case incomprehensible, useless.They were alone on the face of Mars, five people in two small airplanes.It was a new and very peculiar sensation, which only became more acute in the days that followed, when it didnt go away, and they understood that they were going to have to proceed with all their TVs and radios blanked by white noise.It was an experience unique not only in their Martian experience, but in their whole lives.And they quickly found that losing the electronic information net was like losing one of their senses; Nadia kept glancing down at her wristpad, on which, until this breakdown, Arkady could have appeared any second; on which any of the first hundred might have showed up, and declared themselves safe; and then she would look up from the little blank square at the land around her, suddenly so much bigger and wilder and emptier than it had ever been before.It was frightening, truly.Nothing but jagged rust hills for as far as the eye could see, even when flying in the airplanes at dawn and looking for one of the little landing strips marked on the map, which when spotted would resemble little tan pencils.Such a big world!And they were alone in it.Even navigation could no longer be taken for granted, no longer be left to the computers; they had to use road transponders, and dead reckoning, and visual fixes, peering down anxiously in the dawn twilight to spot the next airstrip in the wilderness.Once it took them well into the morning to find a strip near Dao Vallis.After that Yeli began to follow pistes, flying low through the night and watching the silvery ribbon snake below them through the starlight, checking transponder signals against the maps.And so they managed to fly down in the broad lowland of Hellas Basin, following the piste to Low Point Lakefront.Then in the horizontal red light and long shadows of sunrise, a sea of shattered ice came over the horizon into view.It filled the whole western part of Hellas.A sea!The piste they had been following ran right into ice.The frozen shoreline was a jagged tangle of ice plates that were black or red or white or even blue, or a rich jade green all piled together, as if a tidal wave had crushed Big Mans butterfly collection, and left it strewn over a barren beach.Beyond it the frozen sea stretched right over the horizon.After many seconds silence, Ann said, They must have broken the Hellespontus aquifer.That was a really big one, and it would drain down to Low Point.So the Hellas mohole must be flooded!Yeli said.Thats right.And the water at the bottom of it will heat up.Probably hot enough to keep the surface of the lake from freezing.Hard to say.The air is cold, but with the turbulence there might be a clear spot.If not, then right under the surface it will be liquid for sure.Must be some strong convection currents in fact.But the surface ...Yeli said, Well see pretty soon, were going to fly over it.We should be landing, Nadia observed.Well, we will when we can.Besides, things seem to be calming down a bit.Thats just a function of being cut off from news.Hmm.As it turned out they had to fly all the way across the lake, and land on the other side.It was an eerie morning, flying low across a shattered surface reminiscent of the Arctic Sea, except here the ice flows were frosting like an open freezer door, and they were colored across the whole spectrum, heavy on the reds of course, but this only made the occasional blues and greens and yellows stand out more vividly, the focal points of an immense, chaotic mosaic.And there at its center where, even flying as high as they were, the ice sea still extended to the horizon in every direction there was an enormous steam cloud, rising thousands of meters into the air.Circling this cloud cautiously, they saw that the ice underneath it was broken into bergs and floes, floating tight packed in roiling, steaming black water.The dirty bergs rotated, collided, turned turtle and caused thick walls of red black water to splash upward; when these walls fell back down, waves expanded out in concentric circles, bobbing all the bergs up and down as they passed.There was silence in the two planes as they stared down at this most un Martian spectacle.Finally, after two mute circumnavigations of the steam column, they flew on westward over the shattered waste.Sax must be loving this revolution, Nadia said as she had before, breaking the silence.Do you think hes part of it?I doubt it, Ann said.He probably wouldnt risk his Terran investment.Nor an orderly progression to the project, or some kind of control.But Im sure hes evaluating it in terms of how it affects the terraforming.Not whos dying, or whats getting wrecked, or whos taking over here.Just how it affects the project.An interesting experiment, Nadia said.But hard to model, Ann said.They both had to laugh.Speak of the devil they landed west of the new sea (Lakefront was drowned), and spent the day resting, and the next night as they followed the piste northwest toward Marineris, they flew over a transponder that was blinking SOS in Morse code.They circled the transponder until dawn, and landed on the piste itself, just beyond a disabled rover.And next to it was Sax, in a walker, fiddling with the transponder to send his manual SOS.Sax climbed into their plane and slowly took off his helmet, blinking and purse mouthed, his usual bland self.Tired, but looking like the rat that ate the canary, as Ann said to Nadia later.He said little.He had been stuck on the piste in the rover for three days, unable to move; the piste was dead, and his rover had no emergency fuel.Lakefront had indeed drowned: I was leaving for Cairo, he said, to meet with Frank and Maya, because they think it would help to have the whole first hundred together, to form some kind of authority to negotiate with the UNOMA police, and get them to stop.He had taken off, and was in the Hellespontus foothills when the Low Point moholes thermal cloud had suddenly turned yellow, and plumed 20,000 meters into the sky.It turned into a mushroom cloud like a nuclear explosion on Earth; but with a smaller cap, he noted.The temperature gradient isnt so steep in our atmosphere.After that he had turned back, and gone to the edge of the basin to see some of the flooding.The water running down the basin from the north had been black but kept going white, icing over in big segments almost instantaneously, except around Lakefront, where it had bubbled like water on the stove.Thermodynamics were pretty complex there for a while, but the water cooled the mohole pretty fast, and  Shut up, Sax, Ann said.Sax lifted his eyebrows, and went to work improving the planes radio receiver.They flew on, six of them now, Sasha and Yeli, Ann and Simon, Nadia and Sax: six of the first hundred, gathered together as if by magnetism.There was a lot to talk about that night, and they exchanged stories, information, rumors, speculations.But Sax could add little concrete to the overall picture.He had been cut off from the news just as they had been.Again Nadia shuddered as if at a lost sense, realizing that this was a problem that wasnt going to go away.The next morning at sunrise they landed at Bakhuysens airstrip, and were met by a dozen people carrying police stun guns.This little crowd kept their gun barrels down, but escorted the six with very little ceremony into the hangar inside the crater wall.There were more people in the hangar, and the crowd grew all the time.Eventually there were about fifty of them, about thirty of them women.They were perfectly polite, and, when they discovered the travelers identities, even friendly.We just have to make sure who were dealing with, one of them said, a big woman with a strong Yorkshire accent.And who are you?Nadia asked boldly.Were from Korolyov Prime, she said.We escaped.They took the travelers into their dining hall, and treated them to a big breakfast.When they were all seated, people took up magnesium jugs and reached across the table to pour their neighbors apple juice, and their neighbors did likewise, until everyone was served.Then over pancakes the two groups exchanged stories.The Bakhuysen crowd had escaped from Korolyov Prime in the first day of the revolt, and had made their way this far south, with plans to go all the way down to the southern polar region.Thats a big rebel location, the Yorkshire woman (who it turned out was really Finnish) told them.There are these stupendous bench terraces with overhangs, you see, so in effect theyre these long open sided caves, a couple klicks long most of the time, and quite wide really.Perfect for staying out of satellite view but having a bit of air.A kind of a Cro Magnon cliff dweller life theyre setting up down there.Lovely, really.Apparently these long caves had been famous in Korolyov, and a lot of the prisoners had agreed to rendezvous there if a breakout ever occurred.So are you with Arkady?Nadia asked.Who?It turned out they were followers of the biologist Schnelling, who from the sound of it had been a kind of red mystic, held in Korolyov with them, where he had died a few years before.He had given wrist lectures that had been very popular on Tharsis, and after his incarceration many of the prisoners in Korolyov had become his students.Apparently he taught them a kind of Martian communalism based on principles of the local biochemistry.The group at Bakhuysen wasnt very clear about it, but now they were out, and hoping to contact other rebel forces.They had succeeded in establishing contact with a stealthed satellite, programmed to operate in directed microbursts; they had also managed briefly to monitor a channel being used by security forces on Phobos.So they had a little news.Phobos, they said, was being used as a surveillance and attack station by transnational and UNOMA police forces, recently arrived on the latest continuous shuttle.These same forces had control of the elevator, of Pavonis Mons, and of most of the rest of Tharsis; the Olympus Mons observatory had rebelled, but been firestormed from orbit; and transnational security forces had occupied most of the great escarpment, effectively cutting the planet in two.And the war on Earth appeared to be continuing, although they had the impression it was hottest in Africa, Spain, and the U. S.  Mexican border.They thought it was useless to try going to Pavonis; Theyll either lock you up or kill you, as Sonja put it.But when the six travelers decided to try anyway, they were given precise directions to a refuge a nights flight to the west; it was the Southern Margaritifer weather station, the Bakhuysen people told them.Occupied by Bogdanovists.Nadias heart leaped when she heard that word, she couldnt help it.But Arkady had a lot of friends and followers, and none of them seemed to know where he was.Still, she found herself unable to sleep that day, her stomach again tied in a knot.That night at sunset she was happy to return to the planes and take off.The rebels in Bakhuysen sent them on their way so laden with hydrazine and gases and freeze dried food that their planes had a hard time getting off the ground.Their night flights had taken on a strangely ritual aspect, as if they were in the process of inventing a new and exhausting pilgrimage.The two planes were so light that they were buffeted hard by the prevailing western winds, sometimes bouncing wildly ten meters up or down, so that it was impossible to sleep for long even when one was not flying a sudden drop or lift and one was awake again, in the dark little cabin, staring out the window at the black sky and stars above, or the starless black world below.They spoke hardly at all.The pilots hunched forward, expending their energy on keeping a visual fix on the other plane.The planes hummed along, winds keening over their long flexible wings.It was sixty degrees below zero outside, the air only 150 millibars and poisonous; and there was no shelter on the black planet below, for many kilometers in every direction.Nadia would pilot for a while, then move to the back, and twist and turn, and try to sleep.Often the click of a transponder over the radio, combined with the general aspect of their situation, would remind her of the time she and Arkady had ridden the storm in the Arrowhead.She would see him then, striding red bearded and naked through the broken interior of the dirigible, tearing away paneling to throw overboard, laughing, fines floating in a nimbus around him.Then the 16D would jerk her awake, and she would twist with the discomfort of her fear.It would have helped to pilot again, but Yeli wanted to as much as she, at least for the first couple of hours of his watch.There was nothing for it but to help him watch for the other plane, always a kilometer to the right if all was well.They had occasional radio contact with the other plane, but microbursted the calls, and kept them to a minimum hourly checks, or inquiries if one fell behind.In the dead of night it sometimes seemed this was all any of them had ever done, it was hard to recall what life had been like before the revolt.And what had it been, twenty four days?Three weeks, though it felt like five years.And then the sky would begin to bleed behind them, high cirrus clouds turning purple, rust, crimson, lavender, and then swiftly to metal shavings, in a rosy sky; and the incredible fountain of the sun would pour over some rocky rim or scarp, and they would search anxiously as they ghosted over the pocked and shadowed landscape, looking for some sign of an airstrip by the piste.After the eternal night it seemed impossible that they would have navigated successfully to anything at all, but there lay the gleaming piste below, which they could land on directly in an emergency.And the transponders being all individually identifiable, and pegged to the map, their navigation was always more sure than it seemed; so every dawn they would spot a strip down in the shadows ahead, a welcome blond pencil strip of perfect flatness.Down they would glide, thump against the ground, slow down, taxi to whatever facilities they could find, stop the engines, slump back in the seats.Feel the strange lack of vibration, the stillness of another day.That morning they landed at the strip by the Margaritifer station, and were met at their planes by a dozen men and women who were extravagantly enthusiastic in their welcome, hugging and kissing the six travelers countless times, and laughing as they did so.The six clumped together, more alarmed by this than by the wary greeting of the day before.Their welcomers did not neglect to run laser readers over their wrists to identify them, which was reassuring; but when the AI confirmed that they were indeed receiving six of the first hundred, they burst into cheers, and carried on in the very highest of spirits.In fact when the six were led through a lock into a commons, several of their hosts went over immediately to some small tanks, and breathed in hits of what proved to be nitrous oxygen and a pandorphin aerosol, after which they laughed themselves silly.One of them, a slender fresh faced American, introduced himself.Im Steve, I trained with Arkady on Phobos in 12, and worked with him on Clarke.Most of us here worked with him on Clarke.We were in Schiaparelli when the revolution began.Do you know where Arkady is?Nadia asked.Last we heard he was in Carr, but now hes out of the net, which is the way it should be.A tall skinny American shambled up to Nadia, and put his hand on her shoulder and said, Were not always like this!and laughed.Were not!Steve agreed.But its a holiday today!You havent heard?A giggling woman scraped her face off the table and cried, Independence Day!Fourteen the Fourteenth!Watch, watch this, Steve said, and pointed at their TV.An image of space flickered onto the screen, and suddenly the whole group was yelling and cheering.They had locked onto a coded channel from Clarke, Steve explained, and though they could not decode its messages, they had used it as a beacon to aim their stations optical telescope.The image from the telescope had been transferred onto the commons TV, and there it was, the black sky and the stars blocked at the center by the shape they had all learned to recognize, the squared off metallic asteroid with the cable extending out of it.Now watch!they yelled at the puzzled travelers.Watch!They howled again, and some of them began a ragged countdown, starting at one hundred.Some of them were inhaling helium as well as nitrous oxide, and these stood below the big screen singing, Were off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!Because, because, because, because, because of the wonderful things he does!Were off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!Were...off to see the wizard!Nadia found herself shivering.The shouted countdown got louder and louder, reached a shrieked Zero.A gap appeared between the asteroid and the cable.Clarke disappeared from the screen instantly.The cable, gossamer among the stars, dropped out of view almost as fast.Wild cheers filled the room, for a moment at least.But it caught, as if on a hitch, as some of the celebrants were distracted by Ann leaping to her feet, both fists at her mouth.Hes sure to be down by now!Simon cried to Ann over their din.Hes sure to be down!Its been weeks since he called!Slowly it got quiet.Nadia found herself at Anns side, across from Simon and Sasha.She didnt know what to say.Ann was rigid, and her eyes bugged out horribly.How did you break the cable?Sax asked.Well, the cables pretty much unbreakable, Steve replied.You broke the cable?Yeli exclaimed.Well, no, we separated the cable from Clarke, is what we did.But the effect is the same.That cable is on its way down.The group cheered again, somewhat more weakly.Steve explained to the travelers over the noise, The cable itself was pretty much impervious, its graphite whisker with a diamond sponge mesh gel double helixed into it, and theyve got smart pebble defense stations every hundred kilometers, and security on the cars that was intense.So Arkady suggested we work on Clarke itself.See, the cable goes right through the rock to the factories in the interior, and the actual end of it was physically as well as magnetically bonded to the rock of the asteroid.But we landed with a bunch of our robots in a shipment of stuff from orbit, and dug into the interior and placed thermal bombs outside the cable casing, and around the magnetic generator.Then today we set them all off at once, and the rock went liquid at the same time the magnets were interrupted, and you know Clarke is going like a bullet, so it slipped right off the cable end just like that!And we timed it so that its going directly away from the sun, and twenty four degrees out of the plane of the ecliptic as well!So itll be damned hard to track it down.At least we hope so!And the cable itself?Sasha said.It got loud with cheers again, and it was Sax who answered her, in the next quiet moment.Falling, he said.He was at a computer console, typing as fast as he could, but Steve called out to him, We have the figures on the descent if you want them.Its pretty complex, a lot of partial differential equations.I know, Sax said.I cant believe it, said Simon.He still had his hands on Anns arm, and he looked around at the revelers, his face grim.The impacts going to kill a lot of people!Probably not, one of them replied.And those it does kill will mostly be U. N.  police, who have been using the elevator to get down and kill people here on the ground.Hes probably been down a week or two, Simon repeated emphatically to Ann, who was now white faced.Maybe, she said.Some people heard this and quieted down.Others did not want to hear, and continued to celebrate.We didnt know, Steve said to Ann and Simon.His expression of triumph was gone, he was frowning with concern.If we had known, I guess we could have tried to contact him.But we didnt know.Im sorry.Hopefully he swallowedHopefully he wasnt up there.Ann walked back to their table, sat down.Simon hovered anxiously at her side.Neither of them appeared to have heard anything Steve had said.Radio traffic increased somewhat, as those in control of the remaining communications satellites got the news about the cable.Some of the celebrating rebels got busy monitoring and recording these messages; others continued to party.Sax was still absorbed by the equations on the screen.Going east, he remarked.Thats right, Steve said.Itll make a big bow in the middle at first, as the lower part pulls down, and then the rest will follow.How fast?Thats hard to say, but we think about four hours for the first time around, and then an hour for the second time around.Second time around!Sax said.Well, you know, the cable is thirty seven thousand kilometers long, and the circumference at the equator is twenty one thousand.So itll go around almost twice.The people on the equator had better move fast, Sax said.Not exactly the equator, Steve said.The Phobos oscillation will cause it to swerve away from the equator to a certain extent.Thats actually the hardest part to calculate, because it depends where the cable was in its oscillation when it began to fall.North or south?We should know in the next couple of hours.The six travelers stared helplessly at the screen.It was quiet for the first time since their arrival.The screen showed nothing but stars.No vantage point existed from which to view the elevators fall; the cable, never visible for more than a fraction of its length to any single observer, would stay invisible to the end.Or visible only as a falling line of fire.So much for Phylliss bridge, Nadia said.So much for Phyllis, said Sax.The Margaritifer group reestablished contact with the satellite transmissions they had located, and they found they were also able to poach a number of security satellites.From all these channels they were able to piece together a partial account of the cables fall.From Nicosia, a UNOMA team reported that the cable had fallen north of them, crumpling down vertically while yet still rapidly covering ground, as if it were cutting through the turning planet.Though north of them, they thought it was south of the equator.A staticky, panicky voice from Sheffield asked them for confirmation of this; the cable had already fallen across half the city and a line of tents east of it, all the way down the slope of Pavonis Mons and across east Tharsis, flattening a zone ten kilometers wide with its sonic boom; it would have been worse, but the air was so thin at that elevation that it did not carry much force.Now the survivors in Sheffield wanted to know whether to run south to escape the next wrapping, or try to get around the caldera to the north.They got no reply.But more escapees from Korolyov, on the south rim of Melas Chasma in Marineris, reported over one of the rebel channels that the cable was now falling so hard it was shattering on impact.Half an hour later an Aureum drilling operation called in; they had gone out after the sonic booms, and found a mound of glowing brecciated debris, stretching from horizon to horizon.There was an hours absence of any new hard information, nothing but questions and speculation and rumor.Then one of the headphoned listeners leaned back and showed thumbs up to the rest of them, and clicked on the intercom, and an excited voice came on yelling through the static: Its exploding!It came down in about four seconds, it was burning top to bottom and when it hit the ground everything jumped right under our feet!Were having trouble with a leak here.We figure were about eighteen kilometers south of where it hit, and were twenty five south of the equator, so you should be able to calculate the rest of the wrap from that, I hope.It was burning from top to bottom!Like this white line cutting the sky in half!Ive never seen anything like it.Ive still got afterimages in my vision, theyre bright green.It was like a shooting star had stretched...Wait, Jorge is on the intercom, hes out there and saying its only about three meters high where he is.Its soft regolith here, so the cables in a trench it smashed for itself.He says its so deep in places you could bury it and have a level surface.Thosell be like fords, he says, because in other places it stands five or six meters high.I guess itll do that for hundreds of kilometers at a stretch!Itll be like the Great Wall of China.Then a call came in from Escalante Crater, which was right on the equator.They had evacuated immediately on news of the break with Clarke, but had gone south, so that the arrival of the cable had turned out to be a close thing.The cable was now exploding on impact, they reported, and sending sheets of molten ejecta into the sky, lava esque fireworks that arced up into their dawn twilight, and were dim and black by the time they fell back to the surface.During all this time Sax never left his screen, and now he was muttering through pursed lips as he typed and read.The second time around the speed of the fall would accelerate to 21,000 kilometers an hour, he said, almost six kilometers a second; so that for anyone within sight of it a dangerous place to be, deadly if you were not up on a prominence and many kilometers away it would look like a kind of meteor strike, and cross from horizon to horizon in less than a second.Sonic booms to follow.Lets go out and have a look, Steve suggested with a guilty glance at Ann and Simon.A lot of them suited up and went outside.The travelers contented themselves with a video image piped in from the exterior camera, alternating that with video clips gleaned from the satellites.Clips shot from the night side surface were spectacular; they showed a blazing curved line, cutting down like the edge of a white scythe that was trying to chop the planet in two.Even so they found it hard to concentrate, hard to focus on what they were seeing and understand it, much less feel anything about it.They had been exhausted when they had landed, and now they were even more exhausted, and yet it was impossible to sleep; more and more video clips were being passed along, some from robot cameras flying in drones on the day side, showing a blackened steaming swath of desolation the regolith blasted to the side in two long parallel ejecta dikes, banking a canal full of blackness, black all studded with a brecciated mix of stuff which got more exotic as the impact became more severe, until finally a drone camera sent along a clip of a horizon to horizon trench of what Sax said must be rough black diamonds.The impact in the last half hour of the fall was so strong that everything far to north and south was flattened; people were saying that no one close enough actually to see the cable hit survived it, and most of the drone cameras had been smashed as well.For the final thousands of kilometers of the fall, there were no witnesses.A late clip came in from the west side of Tharsis, from the second pass up that great slope.It was brief but powerful: a white blaze in the sky, and an explosion running up the west side of the volcano.Another shot, from a robot in West Sheffield, showed the cable blasting by just to the south; then an earthquake or sonic blast struck, and the whole rim district of Sheffield fell off the rim in a mass, dropping slowly to the caldera floor five kilometers below.After that there were any number of video clips bouncing around the fragmented system, but they proved to be only repeats, or late arrivals, or film of the aftermath.And then the satellites began to shut down again.It had been five hours since the fall began.The six travelers slumped in their chairs, watching or not watching the TV, too tired to feel anything, too tired to think.Well, Sax said, now weve got an equator just like the one I thought the Earth had when I was four years old.A big black line running right around the planet.Ann glared at Sax so bitterly that Nadia worried she would get up and hit him.But none of them moved.The images on the TV flickered, and the speakers hissed and crackled.They saw the new equator line in person, the southern most one anyway, on the second night of their flight toward Shalbatana Vallis.In the dark it was a broad straight black swath, leading them west.As they flew over it Nadia stared down somberly.It hadnt been her project, but it was work, and work destroyed.A bridge brought down.And that black line was also a grave.Not many people on the surface had been killed, except on the east side of Pavonis, but most if not all of those on the elevator must have been, and that in itself meant several thousand people.Most of whom had probably been all right until their part of the cable hit the atmosphere and burned up.As they flew over the wreckage Sax intercepted a new video of the fall.Someone had already stitched up a chronological montage from all the images that had been sent onto the net live, or in the hours immediately afterward.In this montage, a very effective bit of work, the final clips were of the last section of the cable, exploding into the landscape.The impact zone was never anything but a moving white blob, like a flaw in the tape; no video was capable of registering such illumination.But as the montage continued the images had been slowed down and processed in every way possible, and one of these processed images was the final clip, an ultra slow motion shot in which one could see details that would have been impossible to spot live.And so they could see that as the line had crossed the sky, the burning graphite had stripped away first, leaving an incandescent double helix of diamond, flowing majestically out of a sunset sky.All a gravestone, of course, the people on it already dead at that point, burned away; but it was hard to think of them when the image was so utterly strange and beautiful, a vision of some kind of fantasy DNA, DNA from a macroworld made of pure light, plowing into our universe to germinate a barren planet....Nadia stopped watching the TV, moved into the copilots seat to help spot the other plane.All that long night she stared out the window, unable to sleep, unable to get the image of that diamond descent out of her minds eye.It was the longest night of their trip so far, for her.It seemed a kind of eternity before dawn came.But time passed, another night of their lives, and at last dawn came.Soon after sunrise they landed at a pipeline service airstrip above Shalbatana, and stayed with a group of refugees who had been working on the pipeline, and were now caught there.This group had no political stance in common, and wanted only to survive until things got back to normal.Nadia found their attitude only partly refreshing, and tried to get them to go out and repair pipelines; but she did not think they were convinced.That evening they took off once more, again laden with supplies given to them by their hosts.And the following dawn they landed on the abandoned airstrip of Carr Crater.Before eight, Nadia and Sax and Ann and Simon and Sasha and Yeli were out in walkers, and up to the crater rim.The dome was gone.There had been a fire below.All the buildings were intact but scorched, and almost all their windows had been broken or melted.Plastic walls were bent or deformed; concrete was blackened.There were splashes of soot scattered everywhere, and piles of soot scattered here and there on the ground, little heaps of blackened carbon.Sometimes they looked like Hiroshima shadows.Yes, they were bodies.The outlines of people trying to claw down through the sidewalks.The citys air was hyperoxygenated, Sax ventured.In such an atmosphere human skin and flesh were combustible and flammable.That was what had happened to those early Apollo astronauts, stuck in a test capsule filled with an atmosphere of pure oxygen; when the fire started they had burnt like paraffin.And so here.Everyone on the streets had caught fire and rushed around like torches, one could see that by the placement of the soot piles.The six old friends walked down together into the shadow of the eastern crater wall.Under a circular dark pink sky they stopped at the first clutch of blackened bodies, and then walked quickly on.They opened doors in buildings when it was possible, and knocked on all the jammed doors, and listened at the walls with a stethoscope device Sax had brought along.No sound but their own heartbeats, loud and fast at the backs of their coppery throats.Nadia stumbled around, her breath harsh and ragged.She forced herself to look at the bodies she passed, trying to estimate heights from the black piles of carbon.Like Hiroshima, or Pompeii.People were taller now.They still burnt to the bone, though, and even the bones were thin black sticks.When she came to a likely sized pile, she stood staring at it.After a while she approached, and found the right arm, and scraped with her four fingered glove at the back of the charred wristbones, looking for the dotcode tag.She found it, cleaned it.Ran her laser over it like a grocery clerk pricing goods.Emily Hargrove.She moved on, did it again with another likely sized pile.Thabo Moeti.It was better than checking teeth against dental records; but she wouldnt have done that.She was light headed and numb when she came to a soot pile near the city offices, alone, its right hand splayed out so that she only had to check.She cleaned the tag and checked.Arkady Nikelyovich Bogdanov.They flew west for eleven more days, hiding through the daylight hours under stealth blankets, or taking shelter with people they encountered en route.During the nights they followed transponders, or the directions of the last group with which they had stayed.Though these groups often knew of each others existence and location, they were definitely not parts of a single resistance, or coordinated in any way.Some hoped to make it to the south polar cap like the prisoners from Korolyov, others had never heard of this refuge; some were Bogdanovists, others were revolutionaries following different leaders; some were religious communes or utopian experiments, or nationalist groups trying to contact their governments back home; and some were merely collections of survivors without a program, orphaned by the violence.The six travelers even stopped at Korolyov itself, but they did not attempt to enter when they saw the naked frozen bodies of guards outside the locks, some of them propped in standing positions like statues.After Korolyov, they encountered no one.The radios and TVs went dead as satellites were shot out, the pistes were empty, and the Earth was on the other side of the sun.The landscape seemed as barren as before their arrival, except for the spreading patches of frost.They flew on as if they were the only people in the world, the sole survivors.White noise buzzed in Nadias ear, something to do with the planes ventilators no doubt.She checked the ventilators, but they were okay.The others gave her chores to do, let her go on walks by herself before takeoff and after landing.They were stunned themselves by what they had found at Carr and Korolyov, and unable to bring much to the effort of cheering her up, which she found a relief.Ann and Simon were still worried about Peter.Yeli and Sax were worried about their food supplies, dropping all the time; the planes cabinets were nearly bare.But Arkady was dead, and so none of that mattered.The revolt seemed to Nadia more a waste than ever, an unfocused spasm of rage, the ultimate cutting off ones nose to spite ones face.The whole world, wrecked!She told the others to send out a radio message on one of the general channels, announcing that Arkady was dead.Sasha agreed, and helped convince the others to do it.It will help stop things more quickly, Sasha said.Sax shook his head.Insurrections dont have leaders, he said.Besides, no one is likely to hear it.But a couple of days later, it was clear some people had heard it.They received a microburst in response from Alex Zhalin.Look, Sax, this isnt the American Revolution, or the French or the Russian or the English.Its all the revolutions at once, and everywhere!A whole world is in revolt, with a land area equal to Earths, and only a few thousand people are trying to stop it and most of those are still in space, where they have a good view but are very vulnerable.So if they manage to subdue a force in Syrtis, there is another in the Hellespontus.Imagine space based forces trying to stop a revolution in Cambodia, but also in Alaska, Japan, Spain, Madagascar.How do you do it?You cant.I only wish that Arkady Nikelyovich had lived to see it, he would have  The microburst ended abruptly.Perhaps a bad sign, perhaps not.But even Alex hadnt been able to keep a note of discouragement out of his voice, when he talked about Arkady.It was impossible; Arkady had been so much more than a political leader everybodys brother, a natural force, the voice of ones conscience.Ones innate sense of what was fair and just.Ones best friend.Nadia stumped through her grief, helping to navigate their flights by night, sleeping as much as she could through the days.She lost weight.Her hair turned pure white, all the remaining gray and black hairs coming out in her brush.She found it hard to speak.It felt like her throat and guts had petrified.She was a stone, it was impossible to weep.She went about her business instead.No one they met had any food to spare, and they were running out themselves.They set a strict rationing schedule, dividing meals in half.And on the thirty second day of their journey from Lasswitz, after a journey of some 10,000 kilometers, they came to Cairo, up on the southern rim of Noctis Labyrinthus, just to the south of the southernmost strand of the fallen cable.Cairo was under the de facto control of UNOMA, in that no one in the city had ever claimed otherwise, and like all the rest of the big tent cities it lay helpless under the orbiting lasers of UNOMA police ships, which had burned into orbit sometime in the last month.Also most of the inhabitants of Cairo at the beginning of the war had been Arab and Swiss, and in Cairo, at least, people of both nationalities seemed only to be trying to stay out of harms way.Now, however, the six travelers were not the only refugees arriving.A flood of them had just come down Tharsis from the devastation in Sheffield and the rest of Pavonis; others were driving up from Marineris, through the maze of Noctis.The city was at quadruple capacity, with crowds living and sleeping in the streets and parks, the physical plant strained to the breaking point, and food and gases running out.The six travelers were told this by an airstrip worker who was still stubbornly doing her job, although none of the strip shuttles were running anymore.After guiding them into parking places among a great fleet of planes at one end of the strip, she told them to suit up and walk the kilometer to the city wall.It made Nadia unreasonably nervous to leave the two 16Ds behind and walk into a city; and she was not reassured once through the lock, when she saw that most people inside were wearing their walkers and carrying their helmets with them, ready for depressurization if it came.They went to the city offices, and there found Frank and Maya, as well as Mary Dunkel and Spencer Jackson.They all greeted each other with relief, but there was no time for catching up on their various adventures.Frank was busy before a screen, talking to someone in orbit by the sound of it, and he shrugged off their hugs and kept talking, waving once later to acknowledge their appearance.Apparently he was hooked into a functioning communications system, or even more than one, because he stayed in front of the screen talking to one face or another for the next six hours straight, pausing only to sip water or make another call, not sparing another glance for his old compatriots.He seemed to be in a permanent fury, his jaw muscles bunching and unbunching rhythmically; other than that he was in his element, explaining and lecturing, wheedling and threatening, inquiring and then commenting impatiently on the answers he got.Wheeling and dealing in his old style, in other words, but with an angry, bitter, even frightened edge, as if he had walked off a cliff and was trying to argue his way back to ground.When he finally clicked off, he leaned back in his seat and sighed histrionically, then rose stiffly from his seat and came over to greet them, putting a hand briefly on Nadias shoulder.Aside from that he was brusque with all of them, and completely uninterested in how they had managed to make it to Cairo.He only wanted to know whom they had met, and where, and how well these scattered parties were doing, and what they intended.Once or twice he went back to his screen and contacted these groups immediately upon being informed of their location, an ability that stunned the travelers, who had assumed that everyone was as cut off as they had been.UNOMA links, Frank explained, running a hand over his swarthy jaw.Theyre keeping some channels open for me.Why?Sax said.Because Im trying to stop this.Im trying for a cease fire, then a general amnesty, then a reconstruction joined by all.But under whose direction?UNOMAs, of course.And the national offices.But UNOMA agrees only to the cease fire?Sax ventured.While the rebels only agree to the general amnesty?Frank nodded curtly.And neither like the reconstruction joined by all.But the current situation is so bad they may go for it.Four more aquifers have blown since the cable came down.Theyre all equatorial, and some people are saying its cause and effect.Ann shook her head at this, and Frank looked pleased to see it.They were broken open, I was pretty sure.They broke one at the mouth of Chasma Borealis, its pouring out onto the Borealis dunes.The weight of the polar cap probably puts that one under a good bit of pressure, Ann said.Do you know what happened to the Acheron group?Sax asked Frank.No.Theyve disappeared.It might be like with Arkady, Im afraid.He glanced at Nadia, pursed his lips unhappily.I should get back to work.But whats happening on Earth?Ann demanded.What does the U. N.  have to say about all this?Mars is not a nation but a world resource,   Frank quoted heavily.Theyre saying that the tiny fraction of humanity that lives here cant be allowed to control the resources, when the human material base as a whole is so deeply stressed.Thats probably true, Nadia heard herself say.Her voice was harsh, a croak.It felt like she hadnt spoken in days.Frank shrugged.Sax said, I suppose thats why theyve given the transnationals such a free hand.It seems to me theres more of their security here than U. N.  police.Thats right, Frank said.It took the U. N.  a while to agree to deploy their peacekeepers.They dont mind having the dirty work done by someone else.Of course not.And Earth itself?Ann asked again.Frank shrugged.The Group of Seven seems to be getting things under control.He shook his head.Its hard to say from here, it really is.He went to his screen to make more calls.The others went off to eat, to clean up, to sleep, to catch up on friends and acquaintances, on the rest of the first hundred, on what news there was from Earth.The flags of convenience had been destroyed by attacks from the have nots in the south, but apparently the transnationals had fled to the Group of Seven, and had been taken in and defended by the sevens giant militaries.The twelfth attempt at a cease fire had held for several days now.So they had a bit of time to try and recover.But when they went through the comm room, Frank would still be there, shifting ever more surely into a bitter black fury, snapping his way through what seemed an endless nightmare of screen diplomacy, talking on and on in an urgent, scornful, biting tone.He was past cajoling anyone into anything now, it was purely an exertion of will.Trying to move the world without a fulcrum, or with the weakest of fulcrums, his leverage consisting mainly of his old American connections and his current personal standing with a variety of insurrection leaders, both nearly severed by events and the TV blackouts.And both becoming less important daily on Mars itself, as UNOMA and the transnational forces took over town after town.It seemed to Nadia that Frank was now trying to muscle the process along by the sheer force of his anger at his lack of influence.She found she could not stand to be around him; things were bad enough without his black bile.But with Saxs help he got an independent signal to Earth, by contacting Vega and getting the technicians there to transmit messages back and forth.That meant a few hours between transmission and reception, but in a long couple of days after that, he got in five coded exchanges with Secretary of State Wu, and while waiting through the night for return messages, the people on Vega filled the gaps with tapes of Terran news programs that they had not seen.All these reports, when they referred to the Martian situation at all, portrayed the insurrection as a minor disruption caused by criminal elements, principally by escaped prisoners from Korolyov, who had gone on a rampage of senseless property damage, in the process killing great numbers of innocent civilians.Clips of the frozen naked guards outside Korolyov were featured prominently in these reports, as were satellite telephotos of the aquifer outbursts.The most skeptical programs mentioned that these and all other clips from Mars were provided by UNOMA, and some stations in China and the Netherlands even questioned the accuracy of the UNOMA accounts.But they provided no alternative explanation of events, and for the most part, the Terran media disseminated the transnationals version of things.When Nadia pointed this out, Frank snorted.Of course, he said contemptuously.Terran news is transnational.He turned off the sound.Behind him Nadia and Yeli leaned forward instinctively on the bamboo couch, as if that might help them to hear the silent clip better.Their two weeks of being cut off from outside news had seemed like a year, and now they watched the screen helplessly, soaking in whatever information they could.Yeli even stood to turn the sound back up, but saw that Frank was asleep in his chair, his chin on his chest.When a message from the State Department came in Frank jerked awake, turned up the sound, stared at the tiny faces on the screen, snapped out a reply in a hoarse rasp.Then he closed his eyes and slept again.At the end of the second night of the Vega link, he had gotten Secretary Wu to promise to press the U. N.  in New York to restore communications, and halt all police action until the situation could be assessed.Wu was also going to try to get transnational forces ordered back to Earth, though that, Frank noted, would be impossible.The sun had been up for a couple of hours when Frank sent a final acknowledgment to Vega, and shut down.Yeli was asleep on the floor.Nadia stood up stiffly and went for a walk around the park, taking advantage of the light to have a look around.She had to step over bodies sleeping in the grass, in groups of three or four spooned together for warmth.The Swiss had set up big kitchens, and rows of outhouses lining the city wall; it looked like a construction site, and suddenly she found tears running down her face.On she walked.It was nice to be able to walk around in the open light of day.Eventually she returned to the city offices.Frank was standing over Maya, who was asleep on a couch.He stared down at her with a blank expression, then looked up bleary eyed at Nadia.Shes really out.Everyones tired.Hmph.What was it like at Hellas?Under water.He shook his head.Sax must be loving it.Thats what I kept saying.But I think its too out of control for him.
