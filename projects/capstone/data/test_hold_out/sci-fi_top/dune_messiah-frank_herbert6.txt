Another possibility remained, however   one which would cement the desired characteristic into an offspring.Paul dared offer animal breeding to the Bene Gesserit!How much was he really prepared to pay for his Chani's life?Would he accept a cross with his own sister?Sparring for time, the Reverend Mother said: "Tell me, oh flawless exemplar of all that's holy, has Irulan anything to say of your proposal?""Irulan will do what you tell her to do," Paul growled.True enough, Mohiam thought.She firmed her jaw, offered a new gambit: "There are two Atreides. "Paul, sensing something of what lay in the old witch's mind, felt blood darken his face."Careful what you suggest," he said."You'd just use Irulan to gain your own ends, eh?"she asked."Wasn't she trained to be used?"Paul asked.And we trained her, that's what he's saying, Mohiam thought.Well...Irulan's a divided coin.Was there another way to spend such a coin?"Will you put Chani's child on the throne?"the Reverend Mother asked."On my throne. "Paul said.He glanced at wondering suddenly if she knew the divergent possibilities in this exchange.Alia stood with eyes closed, an odd stillness of person about her.With what inner force did she commune?Seeing his sister thus, Paul felt he'd been cast adrift.Alia stood on a shore that was receding from him.The Reverend Mother made her decision, said: "This is too much for one person to decide.I must consult with my Council on Wallach.Will you permit a message?"As though she needed my permission!Paul thought.He said: "Agreed, then.But don't delay too long.I will not sit idly by while you debate. ""Will you bargain with the Bene Tleilaxu?"the ghola asked, his voice a sharp intrusion.Alia's eyes popped open and she stared at the ghola as though she'd been wakened by a dangerous intruder."I've made no such decision," Paul said."What I will do is go into the desert as soon as it can be arranged.Our child will be born in sietch. ""A wise decision," Stilgar intoned.Alia refused to look at Stilgar.It was a wrong decision.She could feel this in every cell.Paul must know it.Why had he fixed himself upon such a path?"Have the Bene Tleilaxu offered their services?"Alia asked.She saw Mohiam hanging on the answer.Paul shook his head."No. "He glanced at Stilgar."Stil, arrange for the message to be sent to Wallach. ""At once, m'Lord. "Paul turned away, waited while Stilgar summoned guards, left with the old witch.He sensed Alia debating whether to confront him with more questions.She turned, instead, to the ghola."Mentat," she said, "will the Tleilaxu bid for favor with my brother?"The ghola shrugged.Paul felt his attention wander.The Tleilaxu?No...not in the way Alia meant.Her question revealed, though, that she had not seen the alternatives here.Well...vision varied from sibyl to sibyl.Why not a variance from brother to sister?Wandering...wandering...He came back from each thought with a start to pick up shards of the nearby conversation."...must know what the Tleilaxu... ""...the fullness of data is always... ""...healthy doubts where...  "Paul turned, looked at his sister, caught her attention.He knew she would see tears on his face and wonder at them.Let her wonder.Wondering was a kindness now.He glanced at the ghola, seeing only Duncan Idaho despite the metallic eyes.Sorrow and compassion warred in Paul.What might those metal eyes record?There are many degrees of sight and many degrees of blindness, Paul thought.His mind turned to a paraphrase of the passage from the Orange Catholic Bible: 'What senses do we lack that we cannot see another world all around us?'Were those metal eyes another sense than sight?Alia crossed to her brother, sensing his utter sadness.She touched a tear on his cheek with a Fremen gesture of awe, said: "We must not grieve for those dear to us before their passing. ""Before their passing," Paul whispered."Tell me, little sister, what is before?"= = = = = =   "I've had a bellyful of the god and priest business!You think I don't see my own mythos?Consult your data once more, Hayt.I've insinuated my rites into the most elementary human acts.The people eat in the name of Muad'dib!They make love in my name, are born in my name   cross the street in my name.A roof beam cannot be raised in the lowliest hovel of far Gangishree without invoking the blessing of Muad'dib!"Book of Diatribes from The Hayt Chronicle   "You risk much leaving your post and coming to me here at this time," Edric said, glaring through the walls of his tank at the Face Dancer."How weak and narrow is your thinking," Scytale said."Who is it who comes to visit you?"Edric hesitated, observing the hulk shape, heavy eyelids, blunt face.It was early in the day and Edric's metabolism had not yet cycled from night repose into full melange consumption."This is not the shape which walked the streets?"Edric asked."One would not look twice at some of the figures I have been today," Scytale said.The chameleon thinks a change of shape will hide him from anything, Edric thought with rare insight.And he wondered if his presence in the conspiracy truly hid them from all oracular powers.The Emperor's sister, now...Edric shook his head, stirring the orange gas of his tank, said: "Why are you here?""The gift must be prodded to swifter action," Scytale said."That cannot be done. ""A way must be found," Scytale insisted."Why?""Things are not to my liking.The Emperor is trying to split us.Already he has made his bid to the Bene Gesserit. ""Oh, that. ""That!You must prod the ghola to...  ""You fashioned him, Tleilaxu," Edric said."You know better than to ask this. "He paused, moved closer to the transparent wall of his tank."Or did you lie to us about this gift?""Lie?""You said the weapon was to be aimed and released, nothing more.Once the ghola was given we could not tamper. ""Any ghola can be disturbed," Scytale said."You need do nothing more than question him about his original being. ""What will this do?""It will stir him to actions which will serve our purposes. ""He is a mentat with powers of logic and reason," Edric objected."He may guess what I'm doing...or the sister.If her attention is focused upon  "  "Do you hide us from the sibyl or don't you?"Scytale asked."I'm not afraid of oracles," Edric said."I'm concerned with logic, with real spies, with the physical powers of the Imperium, with the control of the spice, with  "  "One can contemplate the Emperor and his powers comfortably if one remembers that all things are Finite," Scytale said.Oddly, the Steersman recoiled in agitation, threshing his limbs like some weird newt.Scytale fought a sense of loathing at the sight.The Guild Navigator wore his usual dark leotard bulging at the belt with various containers.Yet...he gave the impression of nakedness when he moved.It was the swimming, reaching movements, Scytale decided, and he was struck once more by the delicate linkages of their conspiracy.They were not a compatible group.That was weakness.Edric's agitation subsided.He stared out at Scytale, vision colored by the orange gas which sustained him.What plot did the Face Dancer hold in reserve to save himself?Edric wondered.The Tleilaxu was not acting in a predictable fashion.Evil omen.Something in the Navigator's voice and actions told Scytale that the Guildsman feared the sister more than the Emperor.This was an abrupt thought flashed on the screen of awareness.Disturbing.Had they overlooked something important about Alia?Would the ghola be sufficient weapon to destroy both?"You know what is said of Alia?"Scytale asked, probing."What do you mean?"Again, the fish man was agitated."Never have philosophy and culture had such a patroness," Scytale said."Pleasure and beauty unite in  "  "What is enduring about beauty and pleasure?"Edric demanded."We will destroy both Atreides.Culture!They dispense culture the better to rule.Beauty!They promote the beauty which enslaves.They create a literate ignorance   easiest thing of all.They leave nothing to chance.Chains!Everything they do forges chains, enslaves.But slaves always revolt. ""The sister may wed and produce offspring," Scytale said."Why do you speak of the sister?"Edric asked."The Emperor may choose a mate for her," Scytale said."Let him choose.Already, it is too late. ""Even you cannot invent the next moment," Scytale warned."You are not a creator...any more than are the Atreides. "He nodded."We must not presume too much. ""We aren't the ones to flap our tongues about creation," Edric protested."We aren't the rabble trying to make a messiah out of Muad'dib.What is this nonsense?Why are you raising such questions?""It's this planet," Scytale said."It raises questions. ""Planets don't speak!""This one does. ""Oh?""It speaks of creation.Sand blowing in the night, that is creation. ""Sand blowing...  ""When you awaken, the first light shows you the new world   all fresh and ready for your tracks. "Untracked sand?Edric thought.Creation?He felt knotted with sudden anxiety.The confinement of his tank, the surrounding room, everything closed in upon him, constricted him.Tracks in sand."You talk like a Fremen," Edric said."This is a Fremen thought and it's instructive," Scytale agreed."They speak of Muad'dib's Jihad as leaving tracks in the universe in the same way that a Fremen tracks new sand.They've marked out a trail in men's lives. ""So?""Another night comes," Scytale said."Winds blow. ""Yes," Edric said, "the Jihad is finite.Muad'dib has used his Jihad and  "  "He didn't use the Jihad," Scytale said."The Jihad used him.I think he would've stopped it if he could. ""If he could?All he had to do was  "  "Oh, be still!"Scytale barked."You can't stop a mental epidemic.It leaps from person to person across parsecs.It's overwhelmingly contagious.It strikes at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues.Who can stop such a thing?Muad'dib hasn't the antidote.The thing has roots in chaos.Can orders reach there?""Have you been infected, then?"Edric asked.He turned slowly in the orange gas, wondering why Scytale's words carried such a tone of fear.Had the Face Dancer broken from the conspiracy?There was no way to peer into the future and examine this now.The future had become a muddy stream, clogged with prophets."We're all contaminated," Scytale said, and he reminded himself that Edric's intelligence had severe limits.How could this point be made that the Guildsman would understand it?"But when we destroy him," Edric said, "the contag  "  "I should leave you in this ignorance," Scytale said."But my duties will not permit it.Besides, it's dangerous to all of us. "Edric recoiled, steadied himself with a kick of one webbed foot which sent the orange gas whipping around his legs."You speak strangely," he said."This whole thing is explosive," Scytale said in a calmer voice."It's ready to shatter.When it goes, it will send bits of itself out through the centuries.Don't you see this?""We've dealt with religions before," Edric protested."If this new  "  "It is not just a religion!"Scytale said, wondering what the Reverend Mother would say to this harsh education of their fellow conspirator."Religious government is something else.Muad'dib has crowded his Qizarate in everywhere, displaced the old functions of government.But he has no permanent civil service, no interlocking embassies.He has bishoprics, islands of authority.At the center of each island is a man.Men learn how to gain and hold personal power.Men are jealous. ""When they're divided, we'll absorb them one by one," Edric said with a complacent smile."Cut off the head and the body will fall to  "  "This body has two heads," Scytale said."The sister   who may wed. ""Who will certainly wed. ""I don't like your tone, Scytale. ""And I don't like your ignorance. ""What if she does wed?Will that shake our plans?""It will shake the universe.

""They are not unique!""You forget, Guildsman, that we once made a kwisatz haderach.This is a being filled by the spectacle of Time.It is a form of existence which cannot be threatened without enclosing yourself in the identical threat.Muad'dib knows we would attack his Chani.We must move faster than we have.You must get to the ghola, prod him as I have instructed. ""And if I do not?""We will feel the thunderbolt. "= = = = = =   Oh, worm of many teeth, Canst thou deny what has no cure?The flesh and breath which lure thee To the ground of all beginnings Feed on monsters twisting in a door of fire!Thou hast no robe in all thy attire To cover intoxications of divinity Or hide the burnings of desire!Wormsong from the Dunebook   Paul had worked up a sweat on the practice floor using crysknife and short sword against the ghola.He stood now at a window looking down into the temple plaza, tried to imagine the scene with Chani at the clinic.She'd been taken ill at midmorning, the sixth week of her pregnancy.The medics were the best.They'd call when they had news.Murky afternoon sandclouds darkened the sky over the plaza.Fremen called such weather "dirty air. "Would the medics never call?Each second struggled past, reluctant to enter his universe.Waiting...waiting...The Bene Gesserit sent no word from Wallach.Deliberately delaying, of course.Prescient vision had recorded these moments, but he shielded his awareness from the oracle, preferring the role here of a Timefish swimming not where he willed, but where the currents carried him.Destiny permitted no struggles now.The ghola could be heard racking weapons, examining the equipment.Paul sighed, put a hand to his own belt, deactivated his shield.The tingling passage of its field ran down against his skin.He'd face events when Chani came, Paul told himself.Time enough then to accept the fact that what he'd concealed from her had prolonged her life.Was it evil, he wondered, to prefer Chani to an heir?By what right did he make her choice for her?Foolish thoughts!Who could hesitate, given the alternatives   slave pits, torture, agonizing sorrow...and worse.He heard the door open, Chani's footsteps.Paul turned.Murder sat on Chani's face.The wide Fremen belt which gathered the waist of her golden robe, the water rings worn as a necklace, one hand at her hip (never far from the knife), the trenchant stare which was her first inspection of any room   everything about her stood now only as a background for violence.He opened his arms as she came to him, gathered her close."Someone," she rasped, speaking against his breast, "has been feeding me a contraceptive for a long time...before I began the new diet.There'll be problems with this birth because of it. ""But there are remedies?"he asked."Dangerous remedies.I know the source of that poison!I'll have her blood. ""My Sihaya," he whispered, holding her close to calm a sudden trembling."You'll bear the heir we want.Isn't that enough?""My life burns faster," she said, pressing against him."The birth now controls my life.The medics told me it goes at a terrible pace.I must eat and eat...and take more spice, as well...eat it, drink it.I'll kill her for this!"Paul kissed her cheek."No, my Sihaya.You'll kill no one. "And he thought: Irulan prolonged your life, beloved.For you, the time of birth is the time of death.He felt hidden grief drain his marrow then, empty his life into a black flask.Chani pushed away from him."She cannot be forgiven!""Who said anything about forgiving?""They why shouldn't I kill her?"It was such a flat, Fremen question that Paul felt himself almost overcome by a hysterical desire to laugh.He covered it by saying: "It wouldn't help. ""You've seen that?"Paul felt his belly tighten with vision memory."What I've seen...what I've seen... "he muttered.Every aspect of surrounding events fitted a present which paralyzed him.He felt chained to a future which, exposed too often, had locked onto him like a greedy succubus.Tight dryness clogged his throat.Had he followed the witchcall of his own oracle, he wondered, until it'd spilled him into a merciless present?"Tell me what you've seen," Chani said."I can't. ""Why mustn't I kill her?""Because I ask it. "He watched her accept this.She did it the way sand accepted water: absorbing and concealing.Was there obedience beneath that hot, angry surface?he wondered.And he realized then that life in the royal Keep had left Chani unchanged.She'd merely stopped here for a time, inhabited a way station on a journey with her man.Nothing of the desert had been taken from her.Chani stepped away from him then, glanced at the ghola who stood waiting near the diamond circle of the practice door."You've been crossing blades with him?"she asked."And I'm better for it. "Her gaze went to the circle on the floor, back to the ghola's metallic eyes."I don't like it," she said."He's not intended to do me violence," Paul said."You've seen that?""I've not seen it!""Then how do you know?""Because he's more than ghola; he's Duncan Idaho. ""The Bene Tleilax made him. ""They made more than they intended. "She shook her head.A corner of her nezhoni scarf rubbed the collar of her robe."How can you change the fact that he is ghola?""Hayt," Paul said, "are you the tool of my undoing?""If the substance of here and now is changed, the future is changed," the ghola said."That is no answer!"Chani objected.Paul raised his voice: "How will I die, Hayt?"Light glinted from the artificial eyes."It is said, m'Lord, that you will die of money and power. "Chani stiffened."How dare he speak thus to you?""The mentat is truthful," Paul said."Was Duncan Idaho a real friend?"she asked."He gave his life for me. ""It is sad," Chani whispered, "that a ghola cannot be restored to his original being. ""Would you convert me?"the ghola asked, directing his gaze to Chani."What does he mean?"Chani asked."To be converted is to be turned around," Paul said."But there's no going back. ""Every man carries his own past with him," Hayt said."And every ghola?"Paul asked."In a way, m'Lord. ""Then what of that past in your secret flesh?"Paul asked.Chani saw how the question disturbed the ghola.His movements quickened, hands clenched into fists.She glanced at Paul, wondering why he probed thus.Was there a way to restore this creature to the man he'd been?"Has a ghola ever remembered his real past?"Chani asked."Many attempts have been made," Hayt said, his gaze fixed on the floor near his feet."No ghola has ever been restored to his former being. ""But you long for this to happen," Paul said.The blank surfaces of the ghola's eyes came up to center on Paul with a pressing intensity."Yes!"Voice soft, Paul said: "If there's a way... ""This flesh," Hayt said, touching left hand to forehead in a curious saluting movement, "is not the flesh of my original birth.It is...reborn.Only the shape is familiar.A Face Dancer might do as well. ""Not as well," Paul said."And you're not a Face Dancer. ""That is true, m'Lord. ""Whence comes your shape?""The genetic imprint of the original cells. ""Somewhere," Paul said, "there's a plastic something which remembers the shape of Duncan Idaho.It's said the ancients probed this region before the Butlerian Jihad.What's the extent of this memory, Hayt?What did it learn from the original?"The ghola shrugged."What if he wasn't Idaho?"Chani asked."He was. ""Can you be certain?"she asked."He is Duncan in every aspect.I cannot imagine a force strong enough to hold that shape thus without any relaxation or any deviation. ""M'Lord!"Hayt objected."Because we cannot imagine a thing, that doesn't exclude it from reality.There are things I must do as a ghola that I would not do as a man. "Keeping his attention on Chani, Paul said: "You see?"She nodded.Paul turned away, fighting deep sadness.He crossed to the balcony windows, drew the draperies.Lights came on in the sudden gloom.He pulled the sash of his robe tight, listened for sounds behind him.Nothing.He turned.Chani stood as though entranced, her gaze centered on the ghola.Hayt, Paul saw, had retreated to some inner chamber of his being   had gone back to the ghola place.Chani turned at the sound of Paul's return.She still felt the thralldom of the instant Paul had precipitated.For a brief moment, the ghola had been an intense, vital human being.For that moment, he had been someone she did not fear   indeed, someone she liked and admired.Now, she understood Paul's purpose in this probing.He had wanted her to see the man in the ghola flesh.She stared at Paul."That man, was that Duncan Idaho?""That was Duncan Idaho.He is still there. ""Would he have allowed Irulan to go on living?"Chani asked.The water didn't sink too deep, Paul thought.And he said: "If I commanded it. ""I don't understand," she said."Shouldn't you be angry?""I am angry. ""You don't sound...angry.You sound sorrowful. "He closed his eyes."Yes.That, too. ""You're my man," she said."I know this, but suddenly I don't understand you. "Abruptly, Paul felt that he walked down a long cavern.His flesh moved   one foot and then another   but his thoughts went elsewhere."I don't understand myself," he whispered.When he opened his eyes, he found that he had moved away from Chani.She spoke from somewhere behind him."Beloved, I'll not ask again what you've seen.I only know I'm to give you the heir we want. "He nodded, then: "I've known that from the beginning. "He turned, studied her.Chani seemed very far away.She drew herself up, placed a hand on her abdomen."I'm hungry.The medics tell me I must eat three or four times what I ate before.I'm frightened, beloved.It goes too fast. "Too fast, he agreed.This fetus knows the necessity for speed.= = = = = =   The audacious nature of Muad'dib's actions may be seen in the fact that He knew from the beginning whither He was bound, yet not once did He step aside from that path.He put it clearly when He said: "I tell you that I come now to my time of testing when it will be shown that I am the Ultimate Servant. "Thus He weaves all into One, that both friend and foe may worship Him.It is for this reason and this reason only that His Apostles prayed: "Lord, save us from the other paths which Muad'dib covered with the Waters of His Life.  "Those "other paths" may be imagined only with the deepest revulsion.from The Yiam el Din (Book of Judgment)   The messenger was a young woman   her face, name and family known to Chani   which was how she'd penetrated Imperial Security.Chani had done no more than identify her for a Security Officer named Bannerjee, who then arranged the meeting with Muad'dib.Bannerjee acted out of instinct and the assurance that the young woman's father had been a member of the Emperor's Death Commandos, the dreaded Fedaykin, in the days before the Jihad.Otherwise, he might have ignored her plea that her message was intended only for the ears of Muad'dib.She was, of course, screened and searched before the meeting in Paul's private office.Even so, Bannerjee accompanied her, hand on knife, other hand on her arm.It was almost midday when they brought her into the room   an odd space, mixture of desert Fremen and Family Aristocrat.Hiereg hangings lined three walls: delicate tapestries adorned with figures out of Fremen mythology.A view screen covered the fourth wall, a silver gray surface behind an oval desk whose top held only one object, a Fremen sandclock built into an orrery.The orrery, a suspensor mechanism from lx, carried both moons of Arrakis in the classic Worm Trine aligned with the sun.Paul, standing beside the desk, glanced at Bannerjee.The Security Officer was one of those who'd come up through the Fremen Constabulary, winning his place on brains and proven loyalty despite the smuggler ancestry attested by his name.He was a solid figure, almost fat.Wisps of black hair fell down over the dark, wet appearing skin of his forehead like the crest of an exotic bird.His eyes were blue blue and steady in a gaze which could look upon happiness or atrocity without change of expression.Both Chani and Stilgar trusted him.Paul knew that if he told Bannerjee to throttle the girl immediately, Bannerjee would do it."Sire, here is the messenger girl," Bannerjee said."M'Lady Chani said she sent word to you. ""Yes. "Paul nodded curtly.Oddly, the girl didn't look at him.Her attention remained on the orrery.She was dark skinned, of medium height, her figure concealed beneath a robe whose rich wine fabric and simple cut spoke of wealth.Her blue black hair was held in a narrow band of material which matched the robe.The robe concealed her hands.Paul suspected that the hands were tightly clasped.It would be in character.Everything about her would be in character   including the robe: a last piece of finery saved for such a moment.Paul motioned Bannerjee aside.He hesitated before obeying.Now, the girl moved   one step forward.When she moved there was grace.Still, her eyes avoided him.Paul cleared his throat.Now the girl lifted her gaze, the whiteless eyes widening with just the right shade of awe.She had an odd little face with delicate chin, a sense of reserve in the way she held her small mouth.The eyes appeared abnormally large above slanted cheeks.There was a cheerless air about her, something which said she seldom smiled.The corners of her eyes even held a faint yellow misting which could have been from dust irritation or the tracery of semuta.Everything was in character."You asked to see me," Paul said.The moment of supreme test for this girl shape had come.Scytale had put on the shape, the mannerisms, the sex, the voice   everything his abilities could grasp and assume.But this was a female known to Muad'dib in the sietch days.She'd been a child, then, but she and Muad'dib shared common experiences.Certain areas of memory must be avoided delicately.It was the most exacting part Scytale had ever attempted."I am Otheym's Lichna of Berk al Dib. "The girl's voice came out small, but firm, giving name, father and pedigree.Paul nodded.He saw how Chani had been fooled.The timbre of voice, everything reproduced with exactitude.Had it not been for his own Bene Gesserit training in voice and for the web of dao in which oracular vision enfolded him, this Face Dancer disguise might have gulled even him.Training exposed certain discrepancies: the girl was older than her known years; too much control tuned the vocal cords; set of neck and shoulders missed by a fraction the subtle hauteur of Fremen poise.But there were niceties, too: the rich robe had been patched to betray actual status...and the features were beautifully exact.They spoke a certain sympathy of this Face Dancer for the role being played."Rest in my home, daughter of Otheym," Paul said in formal Fremen greeting."You are welcome as water after a dry crossing. "The faintest of relaxations exposed the confidence this apparent acceptance had conveyed."I bring a message," she said."A man's messenger is as himself," Paul said.Scytale breathed softly.It went well, but now came the crucial task: the Atreides must be guided onto that special path.He must lose his Fremen concubine in circumstances where no other shared the blame.The failure must belong only to the omnipotent Muad'dib.He had to be led into an ultimate realization of his failure and thence to acceptance of the Tleilaxu alternative."I am the smoke which banishes sleep in the night," Scytale said, employing a Fedaykin code phrase: I bear bad tidings.Paul fought to maintain calmness.He felt naked, his soul abandoned in a groping time concealed from every vision.Powerful oracles hid this Face Dancer.Only the edges of these moments were known to Paul.He knew only what he could not do.He could not slay this Face Dancer.That would precipitate the future which must be avoided at all cost.Somehow, a way must be found to reach into the darkness and change the terrifying pattern."Give me your message," Paul said.Bannerjee moved to place himself where he could watch the girl's face.She seemed to notice him for the First time and her gaze went to the knife handle beneath the Security Officer's hand."The innocent do not believe in evil," she said, looking squarely at Bannerjee.Ahhh, well done, Paul thought.It was what the real Lichna would've said.He felt a momentary pang for the real daughter of Otheym   dead now, a corpse in the sand.There was no time for such emotions, though.He scowled.Bannerjee kept his attention on the girl."I was told to deliver my message in secret," she said."Why?"Bannerjee demanded, voice harsh, probing."Because it is my father's wish. ""This is my friend," Paul said."Am I not a Fremen?Then my friend may hear anything I hear. "Scytale composed the girl shape.Was this a true Fremen custom...or was it a test?"The Emperor may make his own rules," Scytale said."This is the message: My father wishes you to come to him, bringing Chani. ""Why must I bring Chani?""She is your woman and a Sayyadina.This is a Water matter, by the rules of our tribes.She must attest it that my father speaks according to the Fremen Way. "There truly are Fremen in the conspiracy, Paul thought.This moment fitted the shape of things to come for sure.And he had no alternative but to commit himself to this course."Of what will your father speak?"Paul asked."He will speak of a plot against you   a plot among the Fremen. ""Why doesn't he bring that message in person?"Bannerjee demanded.She kept her gaze on Paul."My father cannot come here.The plotters suspect him.He'd not survive the journey. ""Could he not divulge the plot to you?"Bannerjee asked."How came he to risk his daughter on such a mission?""The details are locked in a distrans carrier that only Muad'dib may open," she said."This much I know. ""Why not send the distrans, then?"Paul asked."It is a human distrans," she said."I'll go, then," Paul said."But I'll go alone. ""Chani must come with you!""Chani is with child. ""When has a Fremen woman refused to... ""My enemies fed her a subtle poison," Paul said."It will be a difficult birth.Her health will not permit her to accompany me now. "Before Scytale could still them, strange emotions passed over the girl features: frustration, anger.Scytale was reminded that every victim must have a way of escape   even such a one as Muad'dib.The conspiracy had not failed, though.This Atreides remained in the net.He was a creature who had developed firmly into one pattern.He'd destroy himself before changing into the opposite of that pattern.That had been the way with the Tleilaxu kwisatz haderach.It'd be the way with this one.And then...the ghola."Let me ask Chani to decide this," she said."I have decided it," Paul said."You will accompany me in Chani's stead. ""It requires a Sayyadina of the Rite!""Are you not Chani's friend?"Boxed!Scytale thought.Does he suspect?No.He's being Fremen cautious.And the contraceptive is a fact.Well   there are other ways."My father told me I was not to return," Scytale said, "that I was to seek asylum with you.He said you'd not risk me. "Paul nodded.It was beautifully in character.He couldn't deny this asylum.She'd plead Fremen obedience to a father's command."I'll take Stilgar's wife, Harah," Paul said."You'll tell us the way to your father. ""How do you know you can trust Stilgar's wife?""I know it. ""But I don't. "Paul pursed his lips, then: "Does your mother live?""My true mother has gone to Shai hulud.My second mother still lives and cares for my father.Why?""She's of Sietch Tabr?""Yes. ""I remember her," Paul said."She will serve in Chani's place. "He motioned to Bannerjee."Have attendants take Otheym's Lichna to suitable quarters. "Bannerjee nodded.Attendants.The key word meant that this messenger must be put under special guard.He took her arm.She resisted."How will you go to my father?"she pleaded."You'll describe the way to Bannerjee," Paul said."He is my friend. ""No!My father has commanded it!I cannot!""Bannerjee?"Paul said.Bannerjee paused.Paul saw the man searching that encyclopedic memory which had helped bring him to his position of trust."I know a guide who can take you to Otheym," Bannerjee said."Then I'll go alone," Paul said."Sire, if you...  ""Otheym wants it this way," Paul said, barely concealing the irony which consumed him."Sire, it's too dangerous," Bannerjee protested."Even an Emperor must accept some risks," Paul said."The decision is made.Do as I've commanded. "Reluctantly, Bannerjee led the Face Dancer from the room.Paul turned toward the blank screen behind his desk.He felt that he waited for the arrival of a rock on its blind journey from some height.Should he tell Bannerjee about the messenger's true nature?he wondered.No!Such an incident hadn't been written on the screen of his vision.Any deviation here carried precipitate violence.A moment of fulcrum had to be found, a place where he could will himself out of the vision.If such a moment existed...= = = = = =   No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine / human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.from The Tlielaxu Godbuk   As he crossed over on the high footbridge from his Keep to the Qizarate Office Building, Paul added a limp to his walk.It was almost sunset and he walked through long shadows that helped conceal him, but sharp eyes still might detect something in his carriage that identified him.He wore a shield, but it was not activated, his aides having decided that the shimmer of it might arouse suspicions.Paul glanced left.Strings of sandclouds lay across the sunset like slatted shutters.The air was hiereg dry through his stillsuit filters.He wasn't really alone out here, but the web of Security hadn't been this loose around him since he'd ceased walking the streets alone in the night.Ornithopters with night scanners drifted far overhead in seemingly random pattern, all of them tied to his movements through a transmitter concealed in his clothing.Picked men walked the streets below.Others had fanned out through the city after seeing the Emperor in his disguise   Fremen costume down to the stillsuit and temag desert boots, the darkened features.His cheeks had been distorted with plastene inserts.A catchtube ran down along his left jaw.As he reached the opposite end of the bridge, Paul glanced back, noted a movement beside the stone lattice that concealed a balcony of his private quarters.Chani, no doubt."Hunting for sand in the desert," she'd called this venture.How little she understood the bitter choice.Selecting among agonies, he thought, made even lesser agonies near unbearable.For a blurred, emotionally painful moment, he relived their parting.At the last instant, Chani had experienced a tau glimpse of his feelings, but she had misinterpreted.She had thought his emotions were those experienced in the parting of loved ones when one entered the dangerous unknown.Would that I did not know, he thought.He had crossed the bridge now and entered the upper passageway through the office building.There were fixed glowglobes here and people hurrying on business.The Qizarate never slept.Paul found his attention caught by the signs above doorways, as though he were seeing them for the first time: Speed Merchants.Wind Stills and Retorts.Prophetic Prospects.Tests of Faith.Religious Supply.Weaponry...Propagation of the Faith...A more honest label would've been Propagation of the Bureaucracy, he thought.A type of religious civil servant had sprung up all through his universe.This new man of the Qizarate was more often a convert.He seldom displaced a Freman in the key posts, but he was filling all the interstices.He used melange as much to show he could afford it as for the geriatric benefits.He stood apart from his rulers   Emperor, Guild, Bene Gesserit, Landsraad, Family or Qizarate.His gods were Routine and Records.He was served by mentats and prodigious filing systems.Expediency was the first word in his catechism, although he gave proper lip service to the precepts of the Butlerians.Machines could not be fashioned in the image of a man's mind, he said, but he betrayed by every action that he preferred machines to men, statistics to individuals, the faraway general view to the intimate personal touch requiring imagination and initiative.As Paul emerged onto the ramp at the far side of the building, he heard the bells calling the Evening Rite at Alia's Fane.There was an odd feeling of permanence about the bells.The temple across the thronged square was new, its rituals of recent devising, but there was something about this setting in a desert sink at the edge of Arrakeen   something in the way wind driven sand had begun to weather stones and plastene, something in the haphazard way buildings had gone up around the Fane.Everything conspired to produce the impression that this was a very old place full of traditions and mystery.He was down into the press of people now   committed.The only guide his Security force could find had insisted it be done this way.Security hadn't liked Paul's ready agreement.Stilgar had liked it even less.And Chani had objected most of all.The crowd around him, even while its members brushed against him, glanced his way unseeing and passed on, gave him a curious freedom of movement.It was the way they'd been conditioned to treat a Fremen, he knew.He carried himself like a man of the inner desert.Such men were quick to anger.As he moved into the quickening flow to the temple steps, the crush of people became even greater.Those all around could not help but press against him now, but he found himself the target for ritual apologies: "Your pardon, noble sir.I cannot prevent this discourtesy. ""Pardon, sir; this crush of people is the worst I've ever seen. ""I abase myself, holy citizen.A lout shoved me. "Paul ignored the words after the first few.There was no feeling in them except a kind of ritual fear.He found himself, instead, thinking that he had come a long way from his boyhood days in Caladan Castle.Where had he put his foot on the path that led to this journey across a crowded square on a planet so far from Caladan?Had he really put his foot on a path?He could not say he had acted at any point in his life for one specific reason.The motives and impinging forces had been complex   more complex possibly than any other set of goads in human history.He had the heady feeling here that he might still avoid the fate he could see so clearly along this path.But the crowd pushed him forward and he experienced the dizzy sense that he had lost his way, lost personal direction over his life.The crowd flowed with him up the steps now into the temple portico.Voices grew hushed.The smell of fear grew stronger   acrid, sweaty.Acolytes had already begun the service within the temple.Their plain chant dominated the other sounds   whispers, rustle of garments, shuffling feet, coughs   telling the story of the Far Places visited by the Priestess in her holy trance."She rides the sandworm of space!She guides through all storms 		Into the land of gentle winds.Though we sleep by the snake's den, 		She guards our dreaming souls.Shunning the desert heat, 		She hides us in a cool hollow.The gleaming of her white teeth 		Guides us in the night.By the braids of her hair 		We are lifted up to heaven!Sweet fragrance, flower scented.Surrounds us in her presence. "Balak!Paul thought, thinking in Fremen.Look out!She can be filled with angry passion, too.The temple portico was lined with tall, slender glow tubes simulating candle flame.They flickered.The flickering stirred ancestral memories in Paul even while he knew that was the intent.This setting was an atavism, subtly contrived, effective.He hated his own hand in it.
