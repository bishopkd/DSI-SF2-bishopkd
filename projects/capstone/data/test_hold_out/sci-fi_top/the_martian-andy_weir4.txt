Pathfinder has no way of knowing where it is, so it has no way of knowing where Earth is.The only way for it to find out is getting a signal.They know Im alive!I dont even know what to say.This was an insane plan and somehow it worked!Im going to be talking to someone again.I spent three months as the loneliest man in history and its finally over.Sure, I might not get rescued.But I wont be alone.The whole time I was recovering Pathfinder, I imagined what this moment would be like.I figured Id jump up and down a bit, cheer, maybe flip off the ground (because this whole damn planet is my enemy), but thats not what happened.When I got back to the Hab and took off the EVA suit, I sat down in the dirt and cried.Bawled like a little kid for several minutes.I finally settled down to mild sniffling and then felt a deep calm.It was a good calm.It occurs to me: Now that I might live, I have to be more careful about logging embarrassing moments.How do I delete log entries?Theres no obvious way Ill get to it later.Ive got more important things to do.Ive got people to talk to!*  Venkat grinned as he took the podium in the JPL press room.We received the high gain response just over half an hour ago, he said to the assembled press.We immediately directed Pathfinder to take a panoramic image.Hopefully, Watney has some kind of message for us.Questions?The sea of reporters raised their hands.Cathy, lets start with you, Venkat said, pointing to the CNN reporter.Thanks, she said.Have you had any contact with the Sojourner rover?Unfortunately, no, he replied.The lander hasnt been able to connect to Sojourner, and we have no way to contact it directly.What might be wrong with Sojourner?I cant even speculate, Venkat said.After spending that long on Mars, anything could be wrong with it.Best guess?Our best guess is he took it into the Hab.The landers signal wouldnt be able to reach Sojourner through Hab canvas.Pointing to another reporter, he said, You, there.Marty West, NBC News, Marty said.How will you communicate with Watney once everythings up and running?Thatll be up to Watney, said Venkat.All we have to work with is the camera.He can write notes and hold them up.But how we talk back is trickier.How so?Marty asked.Because all we have is the camera platform.Thats the only moving part.There are plenty of ways to get information across with just the platforms rotation, but no way to tell Watney about them.Hell have to come up with something and tell us.Well follow his lead.Pointing to the next reporter, he said, Go ahead.Jill Holbrook, BBC.With a thirty two minute round trip and nothing but a single rotating platform to talk with, itll be a dreadfully slow conversation, wont it?Yes it will, Venkat confirmed.Its early morning in Acidalia Planitia right now, and just past three a. m.  here in Pasadena.Well be here all night, and thats just for a start.No more questions for now.The panorama is due back in a few minutes.Well keep you posted.Before anyone could ask a follow up, Venkat strode out the side door and hurried down the hall to the makeshift Pathfinder control center.He pressed through the throng to the communications console.Anything, Tim?Totally, he replied.But were staring at this black screen because its way more interesting than pictures from Mars.Youre a smart ass, Tim, Venkat said.Noted.Bruce pushed his way forward.Still another few seconds on the clock, he said.The time passed in silence.Getting something, Tim said.Yup.Its the panoramic.Sighs of relief and muted conversation replaced tense silence as the image began coming through.It filled out from left to right at a snails pace due to the bandwidth limitations of the antique probe sending it.Martian surface Venkat said as the lines slowly filled in.More surface  Edge of the Hab!Bruce said, pointing to the screen.Hab, Venkat smiled.More Hab now more Hab Is that a message?Thats a message!As the image grew, it revealed a handwritten note, suspended at the cameras height by a thin metal rod.We got a note from Mark!Venkat announced to the room.Applause filled the room, then quickly died down.Whats it say?someone asked.Venkat leaned closer to the screen.It says Ill write questions hereAre you receiving?Okay?said Bruce.Thats what it says, Venkat shrugged.Another note, said Tim, pointing to the screen as more of the image came through.Venkat leaned in again.This one says Point here for yes.He folded his arms.All right.We have communication with Mark.Tim, point the camera at Yes.Then, start taking pictures at ten minute intervals until he puts another question up.LOG ENTRY: SOL 97 (2)  Yes!They said, Yes!I havent been this excited about a yes since prom night!Okay, calm down.I have limited paper to work with.These cards were intended to label batches of samples.I have about fifty cards.I can use both sides, and if it comes down to it, I can re use them by scratching out the old question.The Sharpie Im using will last much longer than the cards, so ink isnt a problem.But I have to do all my writing in the Hab.I dont know what kind of hallucinogenic crap that ink is made of, but Im pretty sure it would boil off in Marss atmosphere.Im using old parts of the antenna array to hold the cards up.Theres a certain irony in that.Well need to talk faster than yes/no questions every half hour.The camera can rotate 360 degrees, and I have plenty of antenna parts.Time to make an alphabet.But I cant just use the letters A through Z.  Twenty six letters plus my question card would be twenty seven cards around the lander.Each one would only get 13 degrees of arc.Even if JPL points the camera perfectly, theres a good chance I wont know which letter they meant.So Ill have to use ASCII.Thats how computers manage characters.Each character has a numerical code between 0 and 255.Values between 0 and 255 can be expressed as 2 hexadecimal digits.By giving me pairs of hex digits, they can send any character they like, including numbers, punctuation, etc.How do I know which values go with which characters?Because Johanssens laptop is a wealth of information.I knew shed have an ASCII table in there somewhere.All computer geeks do.So Ill make cards for 0 through 9, and A through F.  That makes 16 cards to place around the camera, plus the question card.Seventeen cards means over 21 degrees each.Much easier to deal with.Time to get to work!Spell with ASCII.0F at 21 degree increments.Will watch camera starting 11:00 my time.When message done, return to this position.Wait 20 minutes after completion to take picture (so I can write and post reply).Repeat process at top of every hour.S T A T U S  No physical problems.All Hab components functional.Eating 3/4 rations.Successfully growing crops in Hab with cultivated soil.Note: Situation not Ares 3 crews fault.Bad luck.H O W A L I V E  Impaled by antenna fragment.Knocked out by decompression.Landed facedown, blood sealed hole.Woke up after crew left.Bio monitor computer destroyed by puncture.Crew had reason to think me dead.Not their fault.C R O P S?Long story.Extreme botany.Have 126 m2 farmland growing potatoes.Will extend food supply, but not enough to last until Ares 4 landing.Modified rover for long distance travel, plan to drive to Ares 4.W E S A W S A T L I T E  Government watching me with satellites?Need tinfoil hat!Also need faster way to communicate.Speak&Spell taking all damn day.Any ideas?B R I N G S J R N R O U T  Sojourner rover brought out, placed 1 meter due north of lander.If you can contact it, I can draw hex numbers on the wheels and you can send me six bytes at a time.S J R N R N O T R S P N D  Damn.Any other ideas?Need faster communication.W O R K I N G O N I T  Earth is about to set.Resume 08:00 my time tomorrow morning.Tell family Im fine.Give crew my best.Tell Commander Lewis disco sucks.*  Venkat blinked his bleary eyes several times as he tried to organize the papers on his desk.His temporary desk at JPL was nothing more than a folding table set up in the back of a break room.People were in and out picking up snacks all day, but on the plus side the coffeepot was nearby.Excuse me, said a man approaching the table.Yes, theyre out of Diet Coke, Venkat said without looking up.I dont know when Site Services refills the fridge.Im actually here to talk to you, Dr.Kapoor.Huh?said Venkat, looking up.He shook his head.Sorry, I was up all night.He gulped his coffee.Who are you again?Jack Trevor, said the thin, pale man before Venkat.I work in software engineering.What can I do for you?We have an idea for communication.Im all ears.Weve been looking through the old Pathfinder software.We got duplicate computers up and running for testing.Same computers they used to find a problem that almost killed the original mission.Real interesting story, actually; turns out there was a priority inversion in Sojourners thread management and  Focus, Jack, interrupted Venkat.Right.Well, the thing is, Pathfinder has an OS update process.So we can change the software to anything we want.How does this help us?Pathfinder has two communications systems.One to talk to us, the other to talk to Sojourner.We can change the second system to broadcast on the Ares 3 rover frequency.And we can have it pretend to be the beacon signal from the Hab.You can get Pathfinder talking to Marks rover?Its the only option.The Habs radio is dead, but the rover has communications equipment made for talking to the Hab and the other rover.Problem is, to implement a new comm system, both ends of it need to have the right software running.We can remotely update Pathfinder, but not the rover.So, Venkat said, you can get Pathfinder to talk to the rover, but you cant get the rover to listen or talk back.Right.Ideally, we want our text to show up on the rover screen, and whatever Watney types to be sent back to us.That requires a change to the rovers software.Venkat sighed.Whats the point of this discussion if we cant update the rovers software?Jack grinned as he continued.We cant do the patch, but Watney can!We can just send the data, and have him enter the update into the rover himself.How much data are we talking about?I have guys working on the rover software right now.The patch file will be twenty meg, minimum.We can send one byte to Watney every four seconds or so with the Speak&Spell.Itd take three years of constant broadcasting to get that patch across.Obviously, thats no good.But youre talking to me, so you have a solution, right?Venkat probed, resisting the urge to scream.Of course!Jack beamed.Software engineers are sneaky bastards when it comes to data management.Enlighten me, said Venkat.Heres the clever part, Jack said, conspiratorially.The rover currently parses the signal into bytes, then identifies the specific sequence the Hab sends.That way, natural radio waves wont throw off the homing.If the bytes arent right, the rover ignores them.Okay, so what?It means theres a spot in the code base where its got the parsed bytes.We can insert a tiny bit of code, just twenty instructions, to write the parsed bytes to a log file before checking their validity.This sounds promising Venkat said.It is!Jack said excitedly.First, we update Pathfinder so it knows how to talk to the rover.Then, we tell Watney exactly how to hack the rover software to add those twenty instructions.Then we have Pathfinder broadcast new software to the rover.The rover logs the bytes to a file.Finally, Watney launches the file as an executable and the rover patches itself!Venkat furrowed his brow, taking in far more information than his sleep deprived mind wanted to accept.Um, Jack said.Youre not cheering or dancing.So we just need to send Watney those twenty instructions?Venkat asked.That, and how to edit the files.And where to insert the instructions in the files.Just like that?Just like that!Venkat was silent for a moment.Jack, Im going to buy your whole team autographed Star Trek memorabilia.I prefer Star Wars, he said, turning to leave.The original trilogy only, of course.Of course, Venkat said.As Jack walked away, a woman approached Venkats table.Yes?Venkat said.I cant find any Diet Coke, are we out?Yes, Venkat said.I dont know when Site Services refills the fridge.Thanks, she said.Just as he was about to get back to work, his mobile rang.He groaned loudly at the ceiling as he snatched the phone from his desk.Hello?he said as cheerfully as he could.I need a picture of Watney.Hi, Annie.Nice to hear from you, too.How are things back in Houston?Cut the shit, Venkat.I need a picture.Its not that simple, Venkat explained.Youre talking to him with a fucking camera.How hard can it be?We spell out our message, wait twenty minutes, and then take a picture.Watneys back in the Hab by then.So tell him to be around when you take the next picture, Annie demanded.We can only send one message per hour, and only when Acidalia Planitia is facing Earth, Venkat said.Were not going to waste a message just to tell him to pose for a photo.Besides, hell be in his EVA suit.You wont even be able to see his face.I need something, Venkat, Annie said.Youve been in contact for twenty four hours and the media is going ape shit.They want an image for the story.Itll be on every news site in the world.You have the pictures of his notes.Make do with that.Not enough, Annie said.The press is crawling down my throat for this.And up my ass.Both directions, Venkat!Theyre gonna meet in the middle!Itll have to wait a few days.Were going to try and link Pathfinder to the rover computer  A few days!?Annie gasped.This is all anyone cares about right now.In the world.This is the biggest story since Apollo 13.Give me a fucking picture!Venkat sighed.Ill try to get it tomorrow.Great!she said.Looking forward to it.LOG ENTRY: SOL 98  I have to be watching the camera when it spells things out.Its half a byte at a time.So I watch a pair of numbers, then look them up on an ASCII cheat sheet I made.Thats one letter.I dont want to forget any letters, so I scrape them into the dirt with a rod.The process of looking up a letter and scraping it in the dirt takes a couple of seconds.Sometimes when I look back at the camera, Ive missed a number.I can usually guess it from context, but other times I just miss out.Today, I got up hours earlier than I needed to.It was like Christmas morning!I could hardly wait for 08:00 to roll around.I had breakfast, did some unnecessary checks on Hab equipment, and read some Poirot.Finally the time came!CNHAKRVR2TLK2PTHFDRPRP4LONGMSG  Yeah.Took me a minute.Can hack rover to talk to Pathfinder.Prepare for long message.That took some mental gymnastics to work out.But it was great news!If we could get that set up, wed only be limited by transmission time!I set up a note that said, Roger.Not sure what they meant by long message, but I figured I better be ready.I went out fifteen minutes before the top of the hour and smoothed out a big area of dirt.I found the longest antenna rod I had, so I could reach into the smooth area without having to step on it.Then I stood by.Waiting.At exactly the top of the hour, the message came.LNCHhexiditONRVRCMP,OPENFILE /usr/lib/habcomm.so SCROLLTILIDXONLFTIS:2AAE5,OVRWRT141BYTSWTHDATAWELLSNDNXTMSG,STANDINVIEW4NXTPIC20MINFTERTHSDONE  Jesus.Okay  They want me to launch hexedit on the rovers computer, then open the file /usr/lib/habcomm.so, scroll until the index reading on the left of the screen is 2AAE5, then replace the bytes there with a 141 byte sequence NASA will send in the next message.Fair enough.Also, for some reason, they want me to hang around for the next pic.Not sure why.You cant see any part of me when Im in the suit.Even the faceplate would reflect too much light.Still, its what they want.I went back in and copied down the message for future reference.Then I wrote a short note and came back out.Usually Id pin up the note and go back in.But this time I had to hang around for a photo op.I gave the camera a thumbs up to go along with my note, which said, Ayyyyyy!Blame the seventies TV.*  I ask for a picture, and I get the Fonz?Annie asked, admonishing Venkat.You got your picture, quit bitching, he said, cradling the phone on his shoulder.He paid more attention to the schematics in front of him than the conversation.Ayyyyyy!Annie mocked.Why would he do that?Have you met Mark Watney?Fine, fine, Annie said.But I want a pic of his face ASAP.Cant do that.Why not?Because if he takes off his helmet, hell die.Annie, I have to go, one of the JPL programmers is here and its urgent.Bye!But Annie said as he hung up.Jack, in the doorway, said, Its not urgent.Yeah, I know, Venkat said.What can I do for you?We were thinking, Jack began.This rover hack might get kind of detailed.We may have to do a bunch of back and forth communication with Watney.Thats fine, Venkat said.Take your time, do it right.We could get things done faster with a shorter transmission time, Jack said.Venkat gave him a puzzled look.Do you have a plan for moving Earth and Mars closer together?Earth doesnt have to be involved, Jack said.Hermes is seventy three million kilometers from Mars right now.Only four light minutes away.Beth Johanssen is a great programmer.She could talk Mark through it.Out of the question, Venkat said.Shes the mission sysop.Jack pressed on.This is her exact area of expertise.Cant do it, Jack.The crew still doesnt know.What is with you?Why wont you just tell them?Watneys not my only responsibility, Venkat said.Ive got five other astronauts in deep space who have to concentrate on their return trip.Nobody thinks about it, but statistically theyre in more danger than Watney right now.Hes on a planet.Theyre in space.Jack shrugged.Fine, well do it the slow way.LOG ENTRY: SOL 98 (2)  Ever transcribed 141 random bytes, one half of a byte at a time?Its boring.And its tricky when you dont have a pen.Earlier, I had just written letters in the sand.But this time, I needed a way to get the numbers onto something portable.My first plan was: Use a laptop!Each crewman had their own laptop.So I have six at my disposal.Rather, I had six.I now have five.I thought a laptop would be fine outside.Its just electronics, right?Itll keep warm enough to operate in the short term, and it doesnt need air for anything.It died instantly.The screen went black before I was out of the airlock.Turns out the L in LCD stands for Liquid.I guess it either froze or boiled off.Maybe Ill post a consumer review.Brought product to surface of Mars.It stopped working.0/10.So I used a camera.Ive got lots of them, specially made for working on Mars.I wrote the bytes in the sand as they came in, took a picture, then transcribed them in the Hab.Its night now, so no more messages.Tomorrow, Ill enter this into the rover and the geeks at JPL can take it from there.*  A notable smell hung in the air of the makeshift Pathfinder control room.The ventilation system was not designed for so many people, and everyone had been working every waking moment without much time for personal hygiene.Come on up here, Jack, said Venkat.You get to be the most Timward today.Thanks, said Jack, taking Venkats place next to Tim.Heya, Tim!Jack, said Tim.How long will the patch take?Venkat asked.Should be pretty much instant, Jack answered.Watney entered the hack earlier today, and we confirmed it worked.We updated Pathfinders OS without any problems.We sent the rover patch, which Pathfinder rebroadcast.Once Watney executes the patch and reboots the rover, we should get a connection.Jesus, what a complicated process, Venkat said.Try updating a Linux server sometime, Jack said.After a moment of silence, Tim said, You know he was telling a joke, right?That was supposed to be funny.Oh, said Venkat.Im a physics guy, not a computer guy.Hes not funny to computer guys, either.Youre a very unpleasant man, Tim, Jack said.Systems online, said Tim.What?Its online.FYI.Holy crap!Jack said.It worked!Venkat announced to the room.*  [11:18] JPL: Mark, this is Venkat Kapoor.Weve been watching you since Sol 49.The whole worlds been rooting for you.Amazing job, getting Pathfinder.Were working on rescue plans.JPL is adjusting Ares 4s MDV to do a short overland flight.Theyll pick you up, then take you with them to Schiaparelli.Were putting together a supply mission to keep you fed till Ares 4 arrives.[11:29] WATNEY: Glad to hear it.Really looking forward to not dying.I want to make it clear it wasnt the crews fault.Side question: What did they say when they found out I was alive?Also, Hi, Mom![11:41] JPL: Tell us about your crops.We estimated your food packs would last until Sol 400 at 3/4 ration per meal.Will your crops affect that number?As to your question: We havent told the crew youre alive yet.We wanted them to concentrate on their own mission.[11:52] WATNEY: The crops are potatoes, grown from the ones we were supposed to prepare on Thanksgiving.Theyre doing great, but the available farmland isnt enough for sustainability.Ill run out of food around Sol 900.Also: Tell the crew Im alive!What the fuck is wrong with you?[12:04] JPL: Well get botanists in to ask detailed questions and double check your work.Your life is at stake, so we want to be sure.Sol 900 is great news.Itll give us a lot more time to get the supply mission together.Also, please watch your language.Everything you type is being broadcast live all over the world.[12:15] WATNEY: Look!A pair of boobs!> (.Y. )*  Thank you, Mr.President, Teddy said into the phone.I appreciate the call, and Ill pass your congratulations on to the whole organization.He terminated the call and put his phone on the corner of his desk, flush with the desktops edges.Mitch knocked on the open door to the office.This a good time?Mitch asked.Come in, Mitch, Teddy said.Have a seat.Thanks, Mitch said, sitting in a fine leather couch.He reached up to his earpiece and lowered the volume.Hows Mission Control?Teddy asked.Fantastic, Mitch said.Alls well with Hermes.And everyones in great spirits thanks to whats going on at JPL.Today was a damn good day for a change!Yes, it was, Teddy agreed.Another step closer to getting Watney back alive.Yeah, about that, said Mitch.You probably know why Im here.I can take a guess, said Teddy.You want to tell the crew Watneys alive.Yes, Mitch said.And youre bringing this up with me while Venkat is in Pasadena, so he cant argue the other side.I shouldnt have to clear this with you or Venkat or anyone else.Im the flight director.It should have been my call from the beginning, but you two stepped in and overrode me.Ignoring all that, we agreed wed tell them when there was hope.And now theres hope.Weve got communication, we have a plan for rescue in the works, and his farm buys us enough time to get him supplies.Okay, tell them, Teddy said.Mitch paused.Just like that?I knew youd be here sooner or later, so I already thought it through and decided.Go ahead and tell them.Mitch stood up.All right.Thanks, he said as he left the office.Teddy swiveled in his chair and looked out his windows to the night sky.He pondered the faint, red dot among the stars.Hang in there, Watney, he said.Were coming.Chapter 12   Watney slept peacefully in his bunk.He shifted slightly as some pleasant dream put a smile on his face.Hed done three EVAs the previous day, all filled with labor intensive Hab maintenance.So he slept deeper and better than he had in a long time.Good morning, crew!Lewis called out.Its a brand new day!Sol 6!Up and at em!Watney added his voice to a chorus of groans.Come on, Lewis prodded, no bitching.You got forty minutes more sleep than you wouldve on Earth.Martinez was first out of his bunk.An air force man, he could match Lewiss navy schedule with ease.Morning, Commander, he said crisply.Johanssen sat up, but made no further move toward the harsh world outside her blankets.A career software engineer, mornings were never her forte.Vogel slowly lumbered from his bunk, checking his watch.He wordlessly pulled on his jumpsuit, smoothing out what wrinkles he could.He sighed inwardly at the grimy feeling of another day without a shower.Watney turned away, hugging a pillow to his head.Noisy people, go away, he mumbled.Beck!Martinez called out, shaking the missions doctor.Rise and shine, bud!Yeah, okay, Beck said blearily.Johanssen fell out of her bunk, then remained on the floor.Pulling the pillow from Watneys hands, Lewis said, Lets move, Watney!Uncle Sam paid a hundred thousand dollars for every second well be here.Bad woman take pillow, Watney groaned, unwilling to open his eyes.Back on Earth, Ive tipped two hundred pound men out of their bunks.Want to see what I can do in 0.4 g?No, not really, Watney said, sitting up.Having rousted the troops, Lewis sat at the comm station to check overnight messages from Houston.Watney shuffled to the ration cupboard and grabbed a breakfast at random.Hand me an eggs, will ya, Martinez said.You can tell the difference?Watney said, passing Martinez a pack.Not really, Martinez said.Beck, whatll you have?Watney continued.Dont care, Beck said.Give me whatever.Watney tossed a pack to him.Vogel, your usual sausages?Ja, please, Vogel responded.You know youre a stereotype, right?I am comfortable with that, Vogel replied, taking the proffered breakfast.Hey Sunshine, Watney called to Johanssen.Eating breakfast today?Mnrrn, Johanssen grunted.Pretty sure thats a no, Watney guessed.The crew ate in silence.Johanssen eventually trudged to the ration cupboard and got a coffee packet.She clumsily added hot water, then sipped until wakefulness crept in.Mission updates from Houston, Lewis said.Satellites show a storm coming, but we can do surface ops before it gets here.Vogel, Martinez, youll be with me outside.Johanssen, youre stuck tracking weather reports.Watney, your soil experiments are bumped up to today.Beck, run the samples from yesterdays EVA through the spectrometer.Should you really go out with a storm on the way?Beck asked.Houston authorized it, Lewis said.Seems needlessly dangerous.Coming to Mars was needlessly dangerous, Lewis said.Whats your point?Beck shrugged.Just be careful.*  Three figures looked eastward.Their bulky EVA suits rendered them nearly identical.Only the European Union flag on Vogels shoulder distinguished him from Lewis and Martinez, who wore the Stars and Stripes.The darkness to the east undulated and flickered in the rays of the rising sun.The storm, Vogel said in his accented English, it is closer than Houston reported.Weve got time, Lewis said.Focus on the task at hand.This EVAs all about chemical analysis.Vogel, youre the chemist, so youre in charge of what we dig up.Ja, Vogel said.Please dig thirty centimeters and get soil samples.At least one hundred grams each.Very important is thirty centimeters down.Will do, Lewis said.Stay within a hundred meters of the Hab, she added.Mm, Vogel said.Yes, maam, said Martinez.They split up.Greatly improved since the days of Apollo, Ares EVA suits allowed much more freedom of motion.Digging, bending over, and bagging samples were trivial tasks.After a time, Lewis asked, How many samples do you need?Seven each, perhaps?Thats fine, Lewis confirmed.Ive got four so far.Five here, Martinez said.Of course, we cant expect the navy to keep up with the air force, now can we?So thats how you want to play it?Lewis said.Just call em as I see em, Commander.Johanssen here.The sysops voice came over the radio.Houstons upgraded the storm to severe.Its going to be here in fifteen minutes.Back to base, Lewis said.*  The Hab shook in the roaring wind as the astronauts huddled in the center.All six of them now wore their flight space suits, in case they had to scramble for an emergency takeoff in the MAV.Johanssen watched her laptop while the rest watched her.Sustained winds over one hundred kph now, she said.Gusting to one twenty five.Jesus, were gonna end up in Oz, Watney said.Whats the abort wind speed?Technically one fifty kph, Martinez said.Any more than that and the MAVs in danger of tipping.Any predictions on the storm track?Lewis asked.This is the edge of it, Johanssen said, staring at her screen.Its gonna get worse before it gets better.The Hab canvas rippled under the brutal assault as the internal supports bent and shivered with each gust.The cacophony grew louder by the minute.All right, Lewis said.Prep for abort.Well go to the MAV and hope for the best.If the wind gets too high, well launch.Leaving the Hab in pairs, they grouped up outside Airlock 1.The driving wind and sand battered them, but they were able to stay on their feet.Visibility is almost zero, Lewis said.If you get lost, home in on my suits telemetry.The winds gonna be rougher away from the Hab, so be ready.Pressing through the gale, they stumbled toward the MAV, with Lewis and Beck in the lead and Watney and Johanssen bringing up the rear.Hey, Watney panted.Maybe we could shore up the MAV.Make tipping less likely.How?Lewis huffed.We could use cables from the solar farm as guylines.He wheezed for a few moments, then continued.The rovers could be anchors.The trick would be getting the line around the  Flying wreckage slammed Watney, carrying him off into the wind.Watney!Johanssen exclaimed.What happened?Lewis said.Something hit him!Johanssen reported.Watney, report, Lewis said.No reply.Watney, report, Lewis repeated.Again, she was met with silence.Hes offline, Johanssen reported.I dont know where he is!Commander, Beck said, before we lost telemetry, his decompression alarm went off!Shit!Lewis exclaimed.Johanssen, where did you last see him?He was right in front of me and then he was gone, she said.He flew off due west.Okay, Lewis said.Martinez, get to the MAV and prep for launch.Everyone else, home in on Johanssen.Dr.Beck, Vogel said as he stumbled through the storm, how long can a person survive decompression?Less than a minute, Beck said, emotion choking his voice.I cant see anything, Johanssen said as the crew crowded around her.Line up and walk west, Lewis commanded.Small steps.Hes probably prone; we dont want to step over him.Staying in sight of one another, they trudged through the chaos.Martinez fell into the MAV airlock and forced it closed against the wind.Once it pressurized, he quickly doffed his suit.Having climbed the ladder to the crew compartment, he slid into the pilots couch and booted the system.Grabbing the emergency launch checklist with one hand, he flicked switches rapidly with the other.One by one, the systems reported flight ready status.As they came online, he noted one in particular.Commander, he radioed.The MAVs got a seven degree tilt.Itll tip at 12.3.Copy that, Lewis said.Johanssen, Beck said, looking at his arm computer, Watneys bio monitor sent something before going offline.My computer just says Bad Packet.I have it, too, Johanssen said.It didnt finish transmitting.Some datas missing, and theres no checksum.Gimme a sec.Commander, Martinez said.Message from Houston.Were officially scrubbed.The storms definitely gonna be too rough.Copy, Lewis said.They sent that four and a half minutes ago, Martinez continued, while looking at satellite data from nine minutes ago.Understood, Lewis said.Continue prepping for launch.Copy, Martinez said.Beck, Johanssen said.I have the raw packet.Its plaintext: BP 0, PR 0, TP 36.2.Thats as far as it got.Copy, Beck said morosely.Blood pressure zero, pulse rate zero, temperature normal.The channel fell silent for some time.They continued pressing forward, shuffling through the sandstorm, hoping for a miracle.Temperature normal?Lewis said, a hint of hope in her voice.It takes a while for the Beck stammered.It takes a while to cool.Commander, Martinez said.Tilting at 10.5 degrees now, with gusts pushing it to eleven.Copy, Lewis said.Are you at pilot release?Affirmative, Martinez replied.I can launch anytime.If it tips, can you launch before it falls completely over?Uh, Martinez said, not expecting the question.Yes, maam.Id take manual control and go full throttle.Then Id nose up and return to preprogrammed ascent.Copy that, Lewis said.Everyone home in on Martinezs suit.Thatll get you to the MAV airlock.Get in and prep for launch.What about you, Commander?Beck asked.Im searching a little more.Get moving.And Martinez, if you start to tip, launch.You really think Ill leave you behind?Martinez said.I just ordered you to, Lewis replied.You three, get to the ship.They reluctantly obeyed Lewiss order and made their way toward the MAV.The punishing wind fought them every step of the way.Unable to see the ground, Lewis shuffled forward.Remembering something, she reached to her back and got a pair of rock drill bits.She had added the one meter bits to her equipment that morning, anticipating geological sampling later in the day.Holding one in each hand, she dragged them along the ground as she walked.After twenty meters, she turned around and walked the opposite direction.Walking a straight line proved to be impossible.Not only did she lack visual references, the endless wind pushed her off course.The sheer volume of attacking sand buried her feet with each step.Grunting, she pressed on.Beck, Johanssen, and Vogel squeezed into the MAV airlock.Designed for two, it could be used by three in emergencies.As it equalized, Lewiss voice came over the radio.Johanssen, she said, would the rover IR camera do any good?Negative, Johanssen replied.IR cant get through sand any better than visible light.Whats she thinking?Beck asked after removing his helmet.Shes a geologist.She knows IR cant get through a sandstorm.She is grasping, Vogel said, opening the inner door.We must get to the couches.Please hurry.I dont feel good about this, Beck said.Neither do I, Doctor, said Vogel, climbing the ladder, but the commander has given us orders.Insubordination will not help.Commander, Martinez radioed, were tilting 11.6 degrees.One good gust and were tipping.What about the proximity radar?Lewis said.Could it detect Watneys suit?No way, Martinez said.Its made to see Hermes in orbit, not the metal in a single space suit.Give it a try, Lewis said.Commander, said Beck, putting on a headset as he slid into his acceleration couch, I know you dont want to hear this, but Watn Marks dead.Copy, Lewis said.Martinez, try the radar.Roger, Martinez radioed.He brought the radar online and waited for it to complete a self check.Glaring at Beck, he said, Whats the matter with you?My friend just died, Beck answered.And I dont want my commander to die, too.Martinez gave him a stern look.Turning his attention back to the radar, he radioed, Negative contact on proximity radar.Nothing?Lewis asked.It can barely see the Hab, he replied.The sandstorms fucking things up.Even if it wasnt, theres not enough metal inShit!Strap in!he yelled to the crew.Were tipping!The MAV creaked as it tilted faster and faster.Thirteen degrees, Johanssen called out from her couch.Buckling his restraints, Vogel said, We are far past balance.We will not rock back.We cant leave her!Beck yelled.Let it tip, well fix it!Thirty two metric tons including fuel, Martinez said, his hands flying over the controls.If it hits the ground, itll do structural damage to the tanks, frame, and probably the second stage engine.Wed never be able to fix it.You cant abandon her!Beck said.You cant.Ive got one trick.If that doesnt work, Im following her orders.Bringing the orbital maneuvering system online, he fired a sustained burn from the nose cone array.The small thrusters fought against the lumbering mass of the slowly tilting spacecraft.You are firing the OMS?Vogel asked.I dont know if itll work.Were not tipping very fast, Martinez said.I think its slowing down  The aerodynamic caps will have automatically ejected, Vogel said.It will be a bumpy ascent with three holes in the side of the ship.Thanks for the tip, Martinez said, maintaining the burn and watching the tilt readout.Cmon   Still thirteen degrees, Johanssen reported.Whats going on up there?Lewis radioed.You went quiet.Respond.Stand by, Martinez replied.Twelve point nine degrees, Johanssen said.It is working, Vogel said.For now, Martinez said.I dont know if maneuvering fuel will last.Twelve point eight now, Johanssen supplied.OMS fuel at sixty percent, Beck said.How much do you need to dock with Hermes?Ten percent if I dont fuck anything up, Martinez said, adjusting the thrust angle.Twelve point six, Johanssen said.Were tipping back.Or the wind died down a little, Beck postulated.Fuel at forty five percent.There is danger of damage to the vents, Vogel cautioned.The OMS was not made for prolonged thrusts.I know, Martinez said.I can dock without nose vents if I have to.Almost there Johanssen said.Okay were under 12.3.OMS cutoff, Martinez announced, terminating the burn.Still tipping back, Johanssen said.11.6 11.5 holding at 11.5.OMS Fuel at twenty two percent, Beck said.Yeah, I see that, Martinez replied.Itll be enough.Commander, Beck radioed, you need to get to the ship now.Agreed, Martinez radioed.Hes gone, maam.Watneys gone.The four crewmates awaited their commanders response.Copy, she finally replied.On my way.They lay in silence, strapped to their couches and ready for launch.Beck looked at Watneys empty couch and saw Vogel doing the same.Martinez ran a self check on the nose cone OMS thrusters.They were no longer safe for use.He noted the malfunction in his log.The airlock cycled.After removing her suit, Lewis made her way to the flight cabin.She wordlessly strapped into her couch, her face a frozen mask.Only Martinez dared speak.Still at pilot release, he said quietly.Ready for launch.Lewis closed her eyes and nodded.Im sorry, Commander, Martinez said.You need to verbally  Launch, she said.Yes, maam, he replied, activating the sequence.The retaining clamps ejected from the launch gantry, falling to the ground.Seconds later, preignition pyros fired, igniting the main engines, and the MAV lurched upward.The ship slowly gained speed.As it did, wind shear blew it laterally off course.Sensing the problem, the ascent software angled the ship into the wind to counteract it.As fuel was consumed, the ship got lighter, and the acceleration more pronounced.Rising at this exponential rate, the craft quickly reached maximum acceleration, a limit defined not by the ships power, but by the delicate human bodies inside.As the ship soared, the open OMS ports took their toll.The crew rocked in their couches as the craft shook violently.Martinez and the ascent software kept it trim, though it was a constant battle.The turbulence tapered off and eventually fell to nothing as the atmosphere became thinner and thinner.Suddenly, all force stopped.The first stage had been completed.The crew experienced weightlessness for several seconds, then were pressed back into their couches as the next stage began.Outside, the now empty first stage fell away, eventually to crash on some unknown area of the planet below.The second stage pushed the ship ever higher, and into low orbit.Lasting less time than the massive first stage, and thrusting much more smoothly, it seemed almost like an afterthought.Abruptly, the engine stopped, and an oppressive calm replaced the previous cacophony.Main engine shutdown, Martinez said.Ascent time: eight minutes, fourteen seconds.On course for Hermes intercept.Normally, an incident free launch would be cause for celebration.This one earned only silence broken by Johanssens gentle sobbing.*  Four months later  Beck tried not to think about the painful reason he was doing zero g plant growth experiments.He noted the size and shape of the fern leaves, took photos, and made notes.Having completed his science schedule for the day, he checked his watch.Perfect timing.The data dump would be completing soon.He floated past the reactor to the Semicone A ladder.Traveling feet first along the ladder, he soon had to grip it in earnest as the centripetal force of the rotating ship took hold.By the time he reached Semicone A he was at 0.4 g.   No mere luxury, the centripetal gravity of Hermes kept them fit.Without it, they would have spent their first week on Mars barely able to walk.Zero g exercise regimens could keep the heart and bones healthy, but none had been devised that would give them full function from Sol 1.Because the ship was already designed for it, they used the system on the return trip as well.Johanssen sat at her station.Lewis sat in the adjacent seat while Vogel and Martinez hovered nearby.The data dump carried e mails and videos from home.It was the high point of the day.Is it here yet?Beck asked as he entered the bridge.Almost, Johanssen said.Ninety eight percent.Youre looking cheerful, Martinez, Beck said.My son turned three yesterday.He beamed.Should be some pics of the party.How about you?Nothing special, Beck said.Peer reviews of a paper I wrote a few years back.Complete, Johanssen said.All the personal e mails are dispatched to your laptops.Also theres a telemetry update for Vogel and a system update for me.Huh theres a voice message addressed to the whole crew.She looked over her shoulder to Lewis.Lewis shrugged.Play it.Johanssen opened the message, then sat back.Hermes, this is Mitch Henderson, the message began.Henderson?Martinez said, puzzled.Talking directly to us without CAPCOM?Lewis held her hand up to signal for silence.I have some news, Mitchs voice continued.Theres no subtle way to put this: Mark Watneys still alive.Johanssen gasped.Wha Beck stammered.Vogel stood with his mouth agape as a shocked expression swept across his face.Martinez looked to Lewis.She leaned forward and pinched her chin.I know thats a surprise, Mitch continued.And I know youll have a lot of questions.Were going to answer those questions.But for now Ill just give you the basics.Hes alive and healthy.We found out two months ago and decided not to tell you; we even censored personal messages.I was strongly against all that.Were telling you now because we finally have communication with him and a viable rescue plan.It boils down to Ares 4 picking him up with a modified MDV.Well get you a full write up of what happened, but its definitely not your fault.Mark stresses that every time it comes up.It was just bad luck.Take some time to absorb this.Your science schedules are cleared for tomorrow.Send all the questions you want and well answer them.Henderson out.The messages end brought stunned silence to the bridge.He Hes alive?Martinez said, then smiled.Vogel nodded excitedly.He lives.Johanssen stared at her screen in wide eyed disbelief.Holy shit, Beck laughed.Holy shit!Commander!Hes alive!I left him behind, Lewis said quietly.The celebrations ceased immediately as the crew saw their commanders expression.But, Beck began, we all left togeth  You followed orders, Lewis interrupted.I left him behind.In a barren, unreachable, godforsaken wasteland.Beck looked to Martinez pleadingly.Martinez opened his mouth, but could find no words to say.Lewis trudged off the bridge.Chapter 13   The employees of Deyo Plastics worked double shifts to finish the Hab canvas for Ares 3.There was talk of triple shifts, if NASA increased the order again.No one minded.The overtime pay was spectacular, and the funding was limitless.Woven carbon thread ran slowly through the press, which sandwiched it between polymer sheets.The completed material was folded four times and glued together.The resulting thick sheet was then coated with soft resin and taken to the hot room to set.LOG ENTRY: SOL 114  Now that NASA can talk to me, they wont shut the hell up.They want constant updates on every Hab system, and theyve got a room full of people trying to micromanage my crops.Its awesome to have a bunch of dipshits on Earth telling me, a botanist, how to grow plants.I mostly ignore them.I dont want to come off as arrogant here, but Im the best botanist on the planet.One big bonus: e mail!Just like the days back on Hermes, I get data dumps.Of course, they relay e mail from friends and family, but NASA also sends along choice messages from the public.Ive gotten e mail from rock stars, athletes, actors and actresses, and even the President.One of them was from my alma mater, the University of Chicago.They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially colonized it.So technically, I colonized Mars.In your face, Neil Armstrong!But my favorite e mail was the one from my mother.Its exactly what youd expect.Thank God youre alive, stay strong, dont die, your father says hello, etc.I read it fifty times in a row.Hey, dont get me wrong, Im not a mamas boy or anything.Im a full grown man who only occasionally wears diapers (you have to in an EVA suit).Its totally manly and normal for me to cling to a letter from my mom.Its not like Im some homesick kid at camp, right?Admittedly, I have to schlep to the rover five times a day to check e mail.They can get a message from Earth to Mars, but they cant get it another ten meters to the Hab.But hey, I cant bitch.My odds of living through this are way higher now.Last I heard, theyd solved the weight problem on Ares 4s MDV.Once it lands here, theyll ditch the heat shield, all the life support stuff, and a bunch of empty fuel tanks.Then they can take the seven of us (Ares 4s crew plus me) all the way to Schiaparelli.Theyre already working on my duties for the surface ops.How cool is that?In other news, Im learning Morse code.Why?Because its our backup communications system.NASA figured a decades old probe isnt ideal as a sole means of communication.If Pathfinder craps out, Ill spell messages with rocks, which NASA will see with satellites.They cant reply, but at least wed have one way communication.Why Morse code?Because making dots and dashes with rocks is a lot easier than making letters.Its a shitty way to communicate.Hopefully it wont come up.All chemical reactions complete, the sheet was sterilized and moved to a clean room.There, a worker cut a strip off the edge, divided it into squares, and put each through a series of rigorous tests.Having passed inspection, the sheet was then cut to shape.The edges were folded over, sewn, and resealed with resin.A man with a clipboard made final inspections, independently verifying the measurements, then approved it for use.LOG ENTRY: SOL 115  The meddling botanists have grudgingly admitted I did a good job.They agree Ill have enough food to last till Sol 900.Bearing that in mind, NASA has fleshed out the mission details of the supply probe.At first, they were working on a desperate plan to get a probe here before Sol 400.But I bought another five hundred sols of life with my potato farm, so they have more time to work on it.Theyll launch next year during the Hohmann Transfer Window, and itll take almost nine months to get here.It should arrive around Sol 856.Itll have plenty of food, a spare oxygenator, water reclaimer, and comm system.Three comm systems, actually.I guess they arent taking any chances, what with my habit of being nearby when radios break.Got my first e mail from Hermes today.NASAs been limiting direct contact.I guess theyre afraid Ill say something like You abandoned me on Mars, you assholes!I know the crew was surprised to hear from the Ghost of Mars Missions Past, but cmon!I wish NASA was less of a nanny sometimes.Anyway, they finally let one e mail through from the Commander:  Watney, obviously were very happy to hear you survived.As the person responsible for your situation, I wish there was more I could do to directly help.But it looks like NASA has a good rescue plan.Im sure youll continue to show your incredible resourcefulness and get through this.Looking forward to buying you a beer back on Earth.Lewis  My reply:  Commander, pure bad luck is responsible for my situation, not you.You made the right call and saved everyone else.I know it must have been a tough decision, but any analysis of that day will show it was the right one.Get everyone else home and Ill be happy.I will take you up on that beer, though.Watney  The employees carefully folded the sheet and placed it in an argon filled airtight shipping container.The man with the clipboard placed a sticker on the package.Project Ares 3; Hab Canvas; Sheet AL102.The package was placed on a charter plane and flown to Edwards Air Force Base in California.It flew abnormally high, at great cost of fuel, to ensure a smoother flight.Upon arrival, the package was carefully transported by special convoy to Pasadena.Once there, it was moved to the JPL Spacecraft Assembly Facility.Over the next five weeks, engineers in white bodysuits assembled Presupply 309.It contained AL102 as well as twelve other Hab Canvas packages.LOG ENTRY: SOL 116  Its almost time for the second harvest.Ayup.I wish I had a straw hat and some suspenders.My reseed of the potatoes went well.Im beginning to see that crops on Mars are extremely prolific, thanks to the billions of dollars worth of life support equipment around me.I now have four hundred healthy potato plants, each one making lots of calorie filled taters for my dining enjoyment.In just ten days theyll be ripe!And this time, Im not replanting them as seed.This is my food supply.All natural, organic, Martian grown potatoes.Dont hear that every day, do you?You may be wondering how Ill store them.I cant just pile them up; most of them would go bad before I got around to eating them.So instead, Ill do something that wouldnt work at all on Earth: throw them outside.Most of the water will be sucked out by the near vacuum; whats left will freeze solid.Any bacteria planning to rot my taters will die screaming.In other news, I got an e mail from Venkat Kapoor:  Mark, some answers to your earlier questions:  No, we will not tell our Botany Team to Go fuck themselves.I understand youve been on your own for a long time, but were in the loop now, and its best if you listen to what we have to say.The Cubs finished the season at the bottom of the NL Central.The data transfer rate just isnt good enough for the size of music files, even in compressed formats.
