A thin steam rose from the gore.They had been using equipment for cover.Prax recognized a microcentrifuge smashed almost out of its casing.Inch thick slivers of ice or glass glittered among the carnage.A nitrogen bath was tipped on its side, the alarm indicator showing it had locked down.A massive blot array easily two hundred kilos lay at an improbable angle, a childs toy thrown aside in the ecstasy of play.What the hell kind of ordnance are you packing?Wendell asked, his voice awed.From the wide passage at ten oclock came shrieks and the sound of gunfire.I dont think this was us, Holden said.Come on.Double time it.They dropped down to the killing floor.A glass cube like the one theyd seen before stood in shattered glory.Blood made the floor slick underfoot.A hand still wrapping a pistol lay in the corner.Prax looked away.Mei was here.He couldnt lose focus.Couldnt be sick.He kept going on.Holden and Amos led the way toward the sound of fighting.Prax trotted along behind them.When he tried to hold back, let Wendell and his compatriot go first, the Pinkwater men gently pushed him forward.They were guarding the rear, Prax realized.In case someone came up from behind.He should have thought of that.The passageway opened out, broad but low.Industrial loading mechs, amber indicators showing idle, stood beside pallets of foam coated supply boxes.Amos and Holden moved down the hall with a practiced efficiency that left Prax winded.But with every turn they reached, every door they opened, he found himself willing them to go faster.She was here, and they had to find her.Before she got hurt.Before something happened.And with every body they found, the sick feeling that something had already happened sank deeper in his gut.They moved forward quickly.Too quickly.When they reached the end of the line an airlock four meters high and at least seven across Prax couldnt imagine that there was anyone behind it.Amos let his automatic shotgun hang at his side as he tapped at the airlock controls.Holden squinted up at the ceiling as if something might be written there.The ground trembled and set the hidden base creaking.Was that a launch?Holden said.That was a launch!Yeah, Amos said.Looks like theyve got a landing pad out there.Monitors arent showing anything else on it, though.Whatever that was, it was the last train outta here.Prax heard someone shouting.It took him only a second to realize it was him.Like he was watching his body move without him, he dashed to the sealed metal doors, pounding them with his clenched fists.She was there.She was just out there, on the ship lifting away from Ganymede.He could feel her like she had a rope tied to his heart and every moment pulled it out of him a little more.He blacked out for a second.Or maybe longer.When he came back to himself, he was slung over Amos wide shoulder, the armor biting into his belly.He pushed up to see the airlock receding slowly behind them.Put me down, Prax said.Cant do it, Amos replied.Cap says   The stuttering of assault rifle fire came, and Amos dropped Prax to the ground and squatted over him, shotgun at the ready.What the fuck, Cap?Amos said.Prax glanced up in time to see the Pinkwater soldier cut down, blood spraying out of his back.Wendell was on the ground, returning fire around a sharp corner.Missed someone, Holden said.Or else they called in their friends.Dont shoot them, Prax said.What if its Mei!What if they have her with them?They dont, Doc, Amos said.Stay down.Holden was shouting, words rolling out of him too fast to follow.Prax didnt know if he was talking to Amos or Wendell or Naomi back on the ship or him.It could have been any of them.All of them.Four men came around the corner, weapons in hand.They wore the same coveralls that all the others had worn.One had long black hair and a goatee.Another was a woman with skin the color of buttercream.The two in the middle could have been brothers the same close cut brown hair, the same long noses.From somewhere to Praxs right, the shotgun spoke twice.All four fell back.It was like something out of a prank comedy.Eight legs, swept at once.Four people Prax didnt know, had never met, just fell down.They just fell down.He knew they were never getting back up.Wendell?Holden said.Report?Caudels dead, Wendell said.He didnt sound sad about it.He didnt sound like anything.I think I broke my wrist.Anyone know where they came from?Nope, Holden said.Lets not assume they were alone, though.They retraced their steps, back through the long, wide passages.Past bodies of men and women they hadnt killed, but who were dead now anyway.Prax didnt try to keep from weeping.There was no point.If he could keep his legs moving, one foot in front of the other, it was enough.They reached the bloodied pit after a few minutes or an hour or a week.Prax couldnt tell, and all options seemed equally plausible.The ruptured bodies stank, the spilled blood thickening to a black currant jelly, the opened viscera freeing colonies of bacteria usually held in check by the gut.On the catwalk, a woman stood.What was her name?Paula.That was it.Why arent you at your post?Wendell snapped when he saw her.Guthrie called for backup.Said he was gut shot and about to pass out.I brought him some adrenaline and speed.Good call, Wendell said.Uchi and Caudel?Didnt make it, Wendell said.The woman nodded, but Prax saw something pass over her.Everyone here was losing someone.His tragedy was just one among dozens.Hundreds.Thousands.By the time the cascade had run all the way out, maybe millions.When death grew that large, it stopped meaning anything.He leaned against the nitrogen bath, his head in his hands.Hed been so close.So close  We have to find that ship, he said.We have to drop back ten and punt, Holden said.We came here looking for a missing kid.Now weve got a covert scientific station halfway to being packed up and shipped out.And a secret landing pad.And whatever third player was fighting with these people while we were.Third player?Paula asked.Wendell gestured to the carnage.Not us, he said.We dont know what were looking at, Holden said.And until we do, we need to back off.We cant stop, Prax said.I cant stop.Mei is   Probably dead, Wendell said.The girls probably dead.And if shes not, shes alive someplace besides Ganymede.Im sorry, Holden said.The dead boy, Prax said.Katoa.His father took the family off Ganymede as soon as he could.Got them someplace safe.Someplace else.Wise move, Holden said.Prax looked to Amos for support, but the big man was poking through the wreckage, pointedly not taking either side.The boy was alive, Prax said.Basia said he knew the boy was dead and he packed up and he left, and when he got on that transport?His boy was here.In this lab.And he was alive.So dont tell me Meis probably dead.They were all silent for a moment.Just dont, Prax said.Cap?Amos said.Just a minute, Holden said.Prax, Im not going to say that I know what youre going through, but I have people I love too.I cant tell you what to do, but let me ask you  ask you to look at what kind of strategy is going to be best for you.And for Mei.Cap, Amos said.Seriously, you should look at this.Amos stood by the shattered glass cube.His shotgun hung forgotten in his hand.Holden walked up to the mans side, following his gaze to the ruined container.Prax pushed away from the nitrogen bath and joined them.There, clinging to the walls of glass that still stood, was a network of fine black filament.Prax couldnt tell if it was an artificial polymer or a natural substance.Some kind of web.It had a fascinating structure, though.He reached out to touch it and Holden grabbed his wrist, pulling him back so hard it hurt.When Holden spoke, his words were measured and calm, which only made the panic behind them more terrifying.Naomi, prep the ship.We have to get off this moon.We have to do it right now.Eighteen: Avasarala  What do you think?the secretary general asked from the upper left pane of the display.On the upper right, Errinwright leaned forward a centimeter, ready to jump in if she lost her temper.Youve read the briefing, sir, Avasarala said sweetly.The secretary general waved his hand in a lazy circle.He was in his early sixties and wore the decades with the elfin charm of a man untroubled by weighty thoughts.The years Avasarala had spent building herself from the treasurer of the Workers Provident Fund to the district governor of the Maharshta Karnataka Goa Communal Interest Zone, hed spent as a political prisoner at a minimum security facility in the recently reconstructed Andean cloud forest.The slow, grinding wheels of power had lifted him to celebrity, and his ability to appear to be listening lent him an air of gravity without the inconvenience of an opinion of his own.Had a man been engineered from birth to be the ideal governmental figurehead, he still wouldnt have achieved the perfection that was Secretary General Esteban Sorrento Gillis.Political briefs never capture the really important things, the bobble head said.Tell me what you think.I think you havent read the fucking briefs, Avasarala thought.Not that I can really complain.She cleared her throat.Its all sparring and no fight, sir, Avasarala said.The players are top level.Michel Undawe, Carson Santiseverin, Ko Shu.They brought enough military to show that its not just the elected monkeys.But so far, the only one whos said anything interesting is a marine they brought in to be a flower arrangement.Otherwise, were all waiting for someone else to say something telling.And what about the secretary general paused and lowered his voice the alternative hypothesis?Theres activity on Venus, Avasarala said.We still dont know what any of it means.There was a massive upwelling of elemental iron in the northern hemisphere that lasted fourteen hours.There has also been a series of volcanic eruptions.Since the planet doesnt have any tectonic motion, were assuming the protomolecule is doing something in the mantle, but we cant tell what.The brains put together a statistical model that shows the approximate energy output expected for the changes weve seen.It suggests that the overall level of activity is rising about three hundred percent per year over that last eighteen months.The secretary general nodded, his expression grave.It was almost as if hed understood any part of what shed said.Errinwright coughed.Do we have any evidence that ties the activity on Venus to the events on Ganymede?he asked.We do, Avasarala said.An anomalous energy spike at the same time as the Ganymede attack.But its only one datapoint.It might have been coincidence.A womans voice came from the secretary generals feed, and he nodded.Im afraid Im called to duty, he said.Youre doing fine work, Avasarala.Damn fine work.I cant tell you what that means coming from you, sir, she said with a smile.Youd fire me.Half a beat later, the secretary general barked out a laugh and wagged his finger at the screen before the green connection ended message took his place.Errinwright sat back, his palms pressed to his temples.Avasarala picked up her cup of tea and sipped it with her eyebrows lifted and her gaze on the camera, inviting him to say something.The tea wasnt quite down to tepid.All right, Errinwright said.You win.Were impeaching him?He actually chuckled.Wherever he was, it was dark outside his windows, so he was on the same side of the planet that she was.That they were both in night gave the meeting a sense of closeness and intimacy that had more to do with her own exhaustion than anything else.What do you need to resolve the Venus situation?he asked.Resolve?Poor choice of words, he said.From the beginning of this, youve had your eye on Venus.Keeping things calm with the Martians.Reining in Nguyen.Noticed that, did you?These talks are stalled, and Im not going to waste you on babysitting a deadlock.We need clarity, and we need it a month ago.Ask for the resources you need, Chrisjen, and either rule Venus out or get us proof.Im giving you a blank check.Retirement at last, she said, laughing.To her surprise, Errinwright took it seriously.If you want, but Venus first.This is the most important question either of us has ever asked.Im trusting you.Ill see to it, she said.Errinwright nodded and dropped the connection.She leaned forward on her desk, fingertips pressed to her lips.Something had happened.Something had changed.Either Errinwright had read enough about Venus to get his own set of the heebie jeebies, or someone wanted her off the Martian negotiation.Someone with enough pull to get Errinwright to kick her upstairs.Did Nguyen have patrons that powerful?Yes, it gave her what she wanted.After all shed said and meant when shed said it she couldnt refuse the project, but the success had a bitter aftertaste.Perhaps she was reading too much into it.God knew she hadnt been getting enough sleep, and fatigue left her paranoid.She checked the time.Ten oclock p. m.  She wouldnt make it back to Arjun that night.Another morning in the depressing VIP quarters, drinking the weak coffee and pretending to care what the latest ambassador from the Pashwiri Autonomous Zone thought about dance music.Screw it, she thought, I need a drink.The Dasihari Lounge catered to the full range in the complex organism that was the United Nations.At the bar, young pages and clerks leaned into the light, laughing too loud and pretending to be more important than they were.It was a mating dance only slightly more dignified than presenting like a mandrill, but endearing in its own fashion.Roberta Draper, the Martian Marine whod shat on the table that morning, was among them, a pint glass dwarfed by her hand and an amused expression on her face.Soren would probably be there, if not that night, another time.Avasaralas son would probably have been among them if things had gone differently.In the center of the room, there were tables with built in terminals to pipe in encrypted information from a thousand different sources.Privacy baffles kept even the waitstaff from glimpsing over the shoulders of the middle range administrators drinking their dinners while they worked.And in the back were dark wooden tables in booths that recognized her before she sat down.If anyone below a certain status walked too close, a discreet young man with perfect hair would sweep up and see them to a different table, elsewhere, with less important people.Avasarala sipped her gin and tonic while the threads of implication wove and rewove themselves.Nguyen couldnt have enough influence to put Errinwright against her.Could the Martians have asked that she be removed?She tried to remember who shed been rude to and how, but no good suspect came to mind.And if they had, what was she going to do about it?Well, if she couldnt be party to the Martian negotiations in an official capacity, she could still have contacts on an informal basis.Avasarala started chuckling even before she knew quite why.She picked up her glass, tapped the table to let it know it was permitted to let someone else sit there, and made her way across the bar.The music was soft arpeggios in a hypermodern tonal scale, which managed to sound soothing despite itself.The air smelled of perfume too expensive to be applied tastelessly.As she neared the bar, she saw conversations pause, glances pass between one young fount of ambition and another.The old lady, she imagined them saying.Whats she doing here?She sat down next to Draper.The big woman looked over at her.There was a light of recognition in her eyes that boded well.She might not know who Avasarala was, but shed guessed what she was.Smart, then.Perceptive.And fucking hell, the woman was enormous.Not fat either, just big.Buy you a drink, Sergeant?Avasarala asked.Ive had a few too many already, she said.And a moment later: All right.Avasarala lifted an eyebrow, and the bartender quietly gave the marine another glass of whatever shed been having before.You made quite an impression today, Avasarala said.I did, Draper said.She seemed serenely unconcerned about it.Thorssons going to ship me out.Im done here.May just be done.Thats fair.Youve accomplished what they wanted from you anyway.Draper looked down at her.Polynesian blood, Avasarala guessed.Maybe Samoan.Someplace that evolution had made humans like mountain ranges.Her eyes were narrowed, and there was a heat to them.An anger.I havent done shit.You were here.Thats all they needed from you.Whats the point?They want to convince me that the monster wasnt theirs.One argument theyve made is that their own soldiers meaning you didnt know about it.By bringing you, theyre showing that they arent afraid to bring you.Thats all they need.You could sit around with your thumb up your ass and argue about the offside rule all day.It would be just as good for them.Youre a showpiece.The marine took it in, then raised an eyebrow.I dont think I like that, she said.Yes, well, Avasarala said, Thorssons a cunt, but if you stop working with politicians just for that, you wont have any friends.The marine chuckled.Then she laughed.Then, seeing Avasaralas gaze on her own, she sobered.That thing that killed your friends?Avasarala said while the marine was looking her in the eye.It wasnt one of mine.Drapers inhalation was sharp.It was like Avasarala had touched a wound.Which made sense, because she had.Drapers jaw worked for a second.It wasnt one of ours either.Well.At least weve got that settled.It wont do any good, though.They wont do anything.They wont talk about anything.They dont care.You know that?They dont care what happened as long as they all protect their careers and make sure the balance of power isnt tilted the wrong way.None of them fucking care what that thing was or where it came from.The bar around them wasnt silent, but it was quieter.The mating dance was now only the second most interesting thing happening at the bar.I care, Avasarala said.As a matter of fact, Ive just been given a very great deal of latitude in finding out what that thing was.It wasnt entirely true.Shed been given a huge budget to implicate or rule out Venus.But it was close, and it was the right frame for what she wanted.Really?Draper said.So what are you going to do?First thing, Im going to hire you.I need a liaison with the Martian military.That should be you.Can you handle it?No one at the bar was talking to anybody now.The room might have been empty.The only sounds were the soft music and Drapers laughter.An older man wearing clove and cinnamon cologne walked by, drawn by the quiet spectacle without knowing what it was.Im a Martian Marine, Draper said.Martian.Youre UN.Earth.We arent even citizens of the same planet.You cant hire me.My names Chrisjen Avasarala.Ask around.They were silent for a moment.Im Bobbie, Draper said.Nice to meet you, Bobbie.Come work for me.Can I think about it?Of course, Avasarala said, and had her terminal send Bobbie her private number.So long as when youre done thinking, you come work for me.At the VIP apartments, Avasarala tuned the system to the kind of music Arjun might be listening to just then.If he wasnt already asleep.She fought back the urge to call him.It was late already, and she was just drunk enough to get maudlin.Sobbing into her hand terminal about how much she loved her husband wasnt something she longed to make a habit of.She pulled off her sari and took a long, hot shower.She didnt drink alcohol often.Usually she didnt like how it dulled her mind.That night it seemed to loosen her up, give her brain the little extra jazz it needed to see connections.Draper kept her connected to Mars, even if not to the day by day slog of the negotiations.That was a good start.There would be other connections too.Foster, in data services, could be brought in.Shed need to start routing more work through him.Build a relationship.It wouldnt do to march in and insist on being his new best friend just because he happened to be managing the encryption requests for Nguyen.A few no strings attached cupcakes first.Then the hook.Who else could she   Her hand terminal chimed a priority alert.She turned off the water and grabbed a bathrobe, wrapping herself tightly and double knotting the stay before she accepted the connection.She was years past flashing someone over a hand terminal, no matter how much shed drunk.The connection came from someone in priority surveillance.The image that flashed up was a middle aged man with ill advised mutton chop whiskers.Ameer!You mad dog.What have you done that they make you work so late?Moved to Atlanta, miss, the analyst said with a toothy grin.He was the only one who ever called her miss.She hadnt spoken to him in three years.Ive just come back from lunch.I had an unscheduled report flagged for you.Contact immediately.I tried your assistant, but he didnt answer.Hes young.He still sleeps sometimes.Its a weakness.Stand by while I set privacy.The moment of friendly banter was over.Avasarala leaned forward, tapping her hand terminal twice to add a layer of encryption.The red icon went green.Go ahead, she said.Its from Ganymede, miss.You have a standing order on James Holden.Yes?Hes on the move.He made an apparent rendezvous with a local scientist.Praxidike Meng.Whats Meng?In Atlanta, Ameer transitioned smoothly to a different file.Botanist, miss.Emigrated to Ganymede with his family when he was a child.Schooled there.Specializes in partial pressure low light soybean strains.Divorced, one child.No known connections to the OPA or any established political party.Go ahead.Holden, Meng, and Burton have left their ship.Theyre armed, and theyve made contact with a small group of private security types.Pinkwater.How many?The on site analyst doesnt say, miss.A small force.Should I query?What lag are we at?Ameers brown black eyes flickered.Forty one minutes, eight seconds, miss.Hold the query.If I have anything else, I can send them together.The on site analyst reports that Holden negotiated with the private security, either a last minute renegotiation or else the whole meeting was extemporaneous.It appears they reached some agreement.The full group proceeded to an unused corridor complex and forced entry.A what?Disused access door, miss.What the fuck is that supposed to mean?How big is it?Where is it?Should I query?You should go to Ganymede and kick this sorry excuse for an on site analyst in the balls.Add a clarification request.Yes, miss, Ameer said with the ghost of a smile.Then, suddenly, he frowned.An update.One moment.So the OPA had something on Ganymede.Maybe something theyd put there, maybe something theyd found.Either way, this mysterious door made things a degree more interesting.While Ameer read through and digested the new update, Avasarala scratched the back of her hand and reevaluated her position.Shed thought Holden was there as an observer.Forward intelligence.That might be wrong.If hed gone to meet with this Praxidike Meng, this utterly under the radar botanist, the OPA might already know quite a bit about Bobbie Drapers monster.Add the fact that Holdens boss had the only known sample of the protomolecule, and a narrative about the Ganymede collapse began to take shape.There were holes in it, though.If the OPA had been playing with the protomolecule, there had been no sign of it.And Fred Johnsons psychological profile didnt match with terrorist attacks.Johnson was old school, and the monster attack was decidedly new.Theres been a firefight, miss.Holden and his people have met armed resistance.Theyve set a perimeter.The on site analyst cant approach.Resistance?I thought this was supposed to be unused.Who the fuck are they shooting at?Shall I query?God damn it!Forty light minutes away, something important was going on, and she was here, in a bedroom that wasnt hers, trying to make sense of it by pressing her ear to the wall.The frustration was a physical sensation.It felt like being crushed.Forty minutes out.Forty minutes back.Whatever she said, whatever order she gave, it would get there almost an hour and a half behind what was clearly a rapidly changing situation.Pull him in, she said.Holden, Burton.Their Pinkwater friends.And this mysterious botanist.Bring them all in.Now.Ameer in Atlanta paused.If theyre in a firefight, miss  Then send in the dogs, break up the fight, and take them in.Were past surveillance.Get it done.Yes, miss.Contact me as soon as its done.Yes, miss.She watched Ameers face as he framed the order, confirmed it, sent it out.She could practically imagine the screen, the strokes of his fingers.She willed him to go faster, to press her intent out past the speed of light and get the damn thing done.Orders out.As soon as I hear from the on site analyst, Ill reach you.Ill be here.If I dont take the connection, try again until I wake up.She dropped the link and sat back.Her brain felt like a swarm of bees.James Holden had changed the game again.The boy had a talent for that, but that in itself made him a known quantity.This other one, this Meng, had come from her blind side.The man might be a mole or a volunteer or a stalking goat sent to lead the OPA into a trap.She considered turning off the light, trying to sleep, then abandoned it as a bad bet.Instead, she set up a connection with the UNs intelligence research database.It was an hour and a half at earliest before shed hear anything more.In the meantime, she wanted to know who Praxidike Meng was and why he mattered.Nineteen: Holden  Naomi, prep the ship.We have to get off this moon.We have to do it right now.All around Holden, the black filaments spread, a dark spiders web with him at the center.He was on Eros again.He was seeing thousands of bodies turning into something else.He thought hed made it off, but Eros just kept coming.He and Miller had gotten out, but it got Miller anyway.Now it was back for him.Whats the matter, Jim?Naomi said from the distance of the suit radio.Jim?Prep the ship!Its the stuff, Amos said.He was talking to Naomi.Like from Eros.Jesus, they Holden managed to gasp out before the fear welled up in his mind, robbing him of speech.His heart banged against his ribs like it wanted out, and he had to check the oxygen levels on his HUD.It felt like there wasnt enough air in the room.Out of the corner of his eye, something appeared to scuttle up the wall like a disembodied hand, leaving a trail of brown slime in its wake.When Holden spun and pointed his assault rifle at it, it resolved into a bloodstain below a discolored patch of ice.Amos moved toward him, a worried look on his broad face.Holden waved him off, then set the butt of his rifle on the ground and leaned on a nearby crate to catch his breath.We should probably move out, Wendell said.He and Paula were helping hold up the man whod been gut shot.The injured man was having trouble breathing.A small red bubble of blood had formed in his left nostril, and it inflated and deflated with each ragged gasp the man took.Jim?Naomi said in his ear, her voice soft.Jim, I saw it through Amos suitcam, and I know what it means.Im getting the ship ready.That encrypted local traffic?Its dropped way off.I think everyones gone.Everyones gone, Holden echoed.The diminished remains of his Pinkwater team were staring at him, the concern on their faces shifting to fear, his own terror infecting them even though they had no idea what the filament meant.They wanted him to do something, and he knew he had to, but he couldnt quite think what it was.The black web filled his head with flashing images, running too quickly to make sense, like video played at high speed: Julie Mao in her shower, the black threads surrounding her, her body twisted into a nightmare; bodies scattered across the floor of a radiation chamber; the zombielike infected staggering off the trams in Eros, vomiting brown bile on everyone around them, even a drop of the goo a death sentence; video captures of the horror show Eros had become; a torso stripped to a rib cage and one arm dragging itself through the protomolecule landscape on some unknowable mission.Cap, Amos said, then moved over to touch Holdens arm.Holden yanked away, almost falling over in the process.He swallowed the thick lemony flavored saliva building up in his throat and said, Okay.Im here.Lets go.Naomi.Call Alex.We need the Roci.Naomi didnt answer for a moment, then said, What about the block   Right fucking now, Naomi!Holden yelled.Right fucking now!Call Alex right now!She didnt reply, but the gut shot man took one final ragged breath and then collapsed, nearly dragging the wounded Wendell to the floor with him.We have to go, Holden said to Wendell, meaning We cant help him.If we stay, we all die.Wendell nodded but went to one knee and began taking the mans light armor off, not understanding.Amos pulled the emergency medkit off his harness and dropped down next to Wendell to begin working on the wounded man while Paula watched, her face pale.Have to go, Holden said again, wanting to grab Amos and shake him until he understood.Amos, stop, we have to go right now.Eros   Cap, Amos interrupted, all due respect, but this aint Eros.He took a syringe from the medkit and gave the downed man an injection.No radiation rooms, no zombies puking goo.Just that broken box, a whole lotta dead guys, and these black threads.We dont know what the fuck it is, but it aint Eros.And we aint leaving this guy behind.The small rational part of Holdens mind knew Amos was right.And more than that, the person Holden wanted to believe he still was would never consider leaving even a complete stranger behind, much less a guy whod taken a wound for him.He forced himself to take three deep, slow breaths.Prax knelt by Amos side, holding the medkit.Naomi, Holden said, meaning to apologize for yelling at her.Alex is on his way, she replied, her voice tight but not accusing.Hes a few hours out.Running the blockade wont be easy, but he thinks hes got an angle.Where is he putting down?Holden found himself answering before he realized hed made the decision.Tell him to land in the Somnambulists berth.Im giving her to someone.Meet us outside the airlock when we get there.He pulled the mag key for the Somnambulist out of a pocket on his harness and tossed it to Wendell.This will get you on the ship youre taking.Consider it a down payment for services rendered.Wendell nodded and tucked the key away, then went back to his injured man.The man appeared to be breathing.Can he be carried?Holden asked Amos, proud of how steady his voice sounded again, trying not to think about the fact that he would have left the man to die a minute before.No choice, Cap.Then somebody pick him up, Holden said.No, not you, Amos.I need you back on point.I got him, Wendell said.I cant shoot for shit with this hand busted.Prax.Help him, Holden said.Were getting the hell out of here.They moved as quickly as injured people could back through the base.Back past the men and women theyd killed getting in and, more frighteningly, the ones they hadnt.Back past Katoas small, still corpse.Praxs gaze drifted toward the body, but Holden grabbed his jacket and shoved him toward the hatch.Its still not Mei, he said.Slow us down and I leave you.The threat made him feel like an ass the moment it left his lips, but it wasnt idle.Finding the scientists lost little girl had stopped being the priority the instant they found the black filaments.And as long as he was being honest with himself, leaving the scientist behind would mean not being there when they found his daughter twisted into a monster by the protomolecule, brown goo leaking from orifices she hadnt been born with, the black threads crawling from her mouth and eyes.The older Pinkwater man whod been covering their exit rushed over to help carry the injured man without being asked.Prax handed the wounded man off to him without a word and then slid in place behind Paula as she scanned the hallways ahead with her machine pistol.Corridors that had seemed boring on the trip in took on a sinister feel on the way back out.The frosted texture that had reminded Holden of spiderwebs when hed come in now looked like the veins of some living thing.Their pulsing had to be caused by adrenaline making his eyes twitch.Eight rems burning off Jupiter onto the surface of Ganymede.Even with the magnetosphere, eight rems a day.How quickly would the protomolecule grow here, with Jupiter endlessly supplying the energy?Eros had become something frighteningly powerful once the protomolecule had taken hold.Something that could accelerate at incredible speeds without inertia.Something that could, if the reports were right, change the very atmosphere and chemical composition of Venus.And that was with just over a million human hosts and a thousand trillion tons of rocky mass to work with at the beginning.Ganymede had ten times as many humans and many orders of magnitude more mass than Eros.What could the ancient alien weapon do with such bounty?Amos threw open the last hatch to the shadow base, and the crew was back in the higher traffic tunnels of Ganymede.Holden didnt see anyone acting infected.No mindless zombies staggering through the corridors.No brown vomit coating the walls and floor, filled with the alien virus looking for a host.No Protogen hired thugs shepherding people into the kill zone.Protogen is gone.An itch at the back of his mind that Holden hadnt even been aware of pushed its way to the front.Protogen was gone.Holden had helped bring them down.Hed been in the room when the architect of the Eros experiment died.The Martian fleet had nuked Phoebe into a thin gas that was sucked into Saturns massive gravity.Eros had crashed into the acidic and autoclave hot atmosphere of Venus, where no human ships could go.Holden himself had taken Protogens only sample of the protomolecule away from them.So who had brought the protomolecule to Ganymede?Hed given the sample to Fred Johnson as leverage to be used in the peace talks.The Outer Planets Alliance had gotten a lot of concessions in the chaos that followed the brief inner planets war.But not everything theyd wanted.The inner planets fleets in orbit around Ganymede were proof of that.Fred had the only sample of the protomolecule left in the solar system.Because Holden had given it to him.It was Fred, he said out loud without realizing it.What was Fred?Naomi asked.This.Whats happening here.He did this.No, Naomi said.To drive the inner planets out, to test some kind of super weapon, something.But he did this.No, Naomi said again.We dont know that.The air in the corridor grew smoky, the nauseating scent of burning hair and flesh choking off Holdens reply.Amos held up a hand to halt the group, and the Pinkwater people stopped and took up defensive positions.Amos moved up the corridor to the junction and looked off to his left for several moments.Something bad happened here, he finally said.Ive got half a dozen dead, more than that celebrating.Are they armed?Holden asked.Oh yeah.The Holden who would have tried to talk his way by them, the Holden who Naomi liked and wanted back, barely put up a struggle when he said, Get us past them.Amos leaned out around the corner and fired off a long burst from his auto shotgun.Go, he said when the echoes of the gunshots had faded away.The Pinkwater people picked up their wounded and hurried up the corridor and beyond the battle; Prax jogged along close behind, head down and thin arms pumping.Holden followed, a glance showing him dead bodies on fire at the center of a wide hallway.Burning them had to be a message.It wasnt quite bad enough yet for them to be eating each other.Was it?There were a few bodies lying outside the fire, bleeding out on the corrugated metal floors.Holden couldnt tell if they were Amos handiwork.The old Holden would have asked.The new one didnt.Naomi, he said, wanting to hear her voice.Im here.Were seeing trouble out here.Is it He heard the dread in her voice.No.Not the protomolecule.But the locals may be bad enough.Seal up the locks, Holden told her, the words coming to him without thought.Warm up the reactor.If something happens to us, leave and rendezvous with Alex.Dont go to Tycho.Jim, she said, I   Dont go to Tycho.Fred did this.Dont go back to him.No, she said.Her new mantra.If we arent there in half an hour, go.Thats an order, XO.At least she would get away, Holden told himself.No matter what happened on Ganymede, at least Naomi would make it out alive.A vision of the nightmare Julie, dead in her shower, but with Naomis face flashed in his mind.He didnt expect the little yelp of grief that escaped him.Amos turned and looked back at him, but Holden waved him on without a word.Fred had done this.And if Fred had, then Holden had too.Holden had spent a year playing enforcer to Freds politician.Hed hunted ships and killed them for Freds grand OPA government experiment.Hed changed the man hed been into the man he was now, because some part of him believed in Freds dream of the liberated and self governed outer planets.And Fred had secretly been planning this.Holden thought of all the things hed put off so that he could help Fred build his new solar system order.Hed never taken Naomi to meet his family back on Earth.Not that Naomi herself could have ever gone to Earth.But he could have flown his family up to Luna to meet her.Father Tom would have resisted.He hated travel.But Holden had no doubt that in the end he would have gotten them all to come meet her once he explained how important shed become to him.And meeting Prax, seeing his need to find his daughter, made Holden realize how badly he wanted to know what that was like.To experience that sort of hunger for the presence of another human being.To present another generation to his parents.To show them that all the effort and energy they had put into him had paid off.That he was passing it along.He wanted, almost more than hed wanted anything before, to see the looks on their faces when he showed them a child.His child.Naomis child.Fred had taken that from him, first by wasting his time as the OPAs leg breaker, and now by this betrayal.Holden swore to himself that if he made it off Ganymede, Fred would pay for all of it.Amos halted the group again, and Holden noticed that they were back at the port.He shook himself out of his reverie.He didnt remember how theyd gotten there.Looks clear, Amos said.Naomi, Holden said, what does it look like around the ship?Looks clear here, she said.But Alex is worried that   Her voice was cut off by an electronic squeal.Naomi?Naomi!Holden yelled, but there was no response.To Amos he said, Go, double time it to the ship!Amos and the Pinkwater people ran toward the docks as quickly as their injured bodies and the unconscious teammate would let them.Holden brought up the rear, shouldering his assault rifle and flicking off the safety as he ran.They ran through the twisting corridors of the port sector, Amos scattering pedestrians with loud shouts and the unspoken threat of his shotgun.An old woman in a hijab scurried away before them like a leaf driven before a storm.She was dead already.If the protomolecule was loose, everyone Holden passed was dead already.Santichai and Melissa Supitayaporn and all the people theyd come to Ganymede to save.The rioters and killers whod been normal citizens of the station before their social ecosystem collapsed.If the protomolecule was loose, all of them were as good as dead.So why hadnt it happened?Holden pushed the thought aside.Later if there was a later he could worry about it.Someone shouted at Amos, and Amos fired his shotgun into the ceiling once.If port security still existed outside of the vultures trying to take a cut of every incoming shipment, they didnt try to stop them.The outer airlock door of the Somnambulist was closed when they reached it.Naomi, you there?Holden asked, fumbling in his pockets for the swipe card.She didnt reply, and it took him a moment to remember hed given the card to Wendell.Wendell, open the door for us.The Pinkwater leader didnt reply.Wendell  Holden started, then stopped when he saw that Wendell was staring, wide eyed, at something behind him.Holden turned to look and saw five men Earthers, all of them in plain gray armor without insignias.All were armed with large bore weapons.No, Holden thought, and brought his gun up and across them in a full auto sweep.Three of the five men dropped, their armor blooming red.The new Holden rejoiced; the old was quiet.It didnt matter who these men were.Station security or inner planet military or just leftover mercenaries from the now destroyed shadow base, hed kill them all before he let them stop him from getting his crew off this infected moon.He never saw who fired the shot that took his leg out from under him.One second he was standing, emptying the magazine of his assault rifle into the gray armored fire team, and the next a sledgehammer blow hit the armor on his right thigh, knocking him off his feet.As he fell, he saw the two remaining gray armored soldiers go down as Amos auto shotgun unloaded in a single long roar.Holden rolled to his side, looking to see if anyone else was hurt, and saw that the five on his side had been only half of the enemy team.The Pinkwater people were raising their hands and dropping their weapons as five more gray armored soldiers came down the corridor from behind.Amos never saw them.He dropped the expended magazine from his auto shotgun and was pulling a new one off his harness when one of the mercenaries aimed a large weapon at the back of his head and pulled the trigger.Amos helmet flew off and he was slapped forward onto the corrugated metal decking with a wet crunch.Blood splashed across the floor where he hit it.Holden tried to get a new magazine into his assault rifle, but his hands wouldnt cooperate and before he could reload his gun, one of the soldiers had crossed the distance and kicked the rifle away from him.Holden had time to see the still standing members of his Pinkwater team disappear into black bags before one came down over his own head and plunged him into darkness.Twenty: Bobbie  The Martian delegation had been given a suite of offices in the UN building for their own use.The furniture was all real wood; the paintings on the walls were originals and not prints.The carpet smelled new.Bobbie thought that either everyone in the UN campus lived like a king, or they were just going out of their way to impress the Martians.Thorsson had called her a few hours after shed left her run in with Avasarala at the bar, and had demanded that she meet with him the next day.Now she waited in the lobby of their temporary office suite, sitting in a bergere style chair with green velvet cushions and a cherry wood frame that would have cost her two years salary on Mars.A screen set into the wall across from her played a news channel with the sound muted.It turned the program into a confusing and occasionally macabre slide show of images: two talking heads sitting at a desk in a blue room, a large building on fire, a woman walking down a long white hallway while gesturing animatedly to both sides, a UN battleship parked at an orbital station with severe damage scarring its flank, a red faced man talking directly into the camera against the backdrop of a flag Bobbie didnt recognize.It all meant something and nothing at the same time.A few hours before, this would have frustrated Bobbie.She would have felt compelled to go find the remote and turn the sound up, to add context to the information being thrown at her.Now she just let the images flow around her like canal water past a rock.A young man shed seen a few times on the Dae Jung but had never actually met hurried through the lobby, tapping furiously on his terminal.When he was halfway across the room, he said, Hes ready for you.It took Bobbie a moment to realize the young man had been talking to her.Apparently her stock had fallen far enough that she no longer warranted face to face delivery of information.More meaningless data.More water flowing past her.She pushed herself to her feet with a grunt.Her hours long walk at one g the previous day had taken more out of her than shed realized.She was vaguely surprised to find that Thorssons office was one of the smallest in the suite.That meant that either he didnt care about the unspoken status conferred through office size, or he was actually the least important member of the delegation to still rate a private workspace.She felt no compulsion to figure out which.Thorsson did not react to her arrival, his head bent over his desk terminal.Bobbie didnt care about being ignored, or about the lesson he was trying to teach her with it.The size of the office meant that Thorsson had no chair for guests, and the ache in her legs was sufficiently distracting.I may have overreacted earlier, he finally said.Oh?Bobbie replied, thinking about where she might find more of that soy milk tea.Thorsson looked up at her.His face was trying its mummified remains version of a warm smile.Let me be clear.Theres no doubt that you damaged our credibility with your outburst.But, as Martens points out, that is largely my fault for not fully understanding the extent of your trauma.Ah, Bobbie said.There was a framed photograph on the wall behind Thorsson of a city with a tall metal structure in the foreground.It looked like an archaic rocket gantry.The caption read PARIS.So instead of sending you home, I will be keeping you on staff here.Youll be given an opportunity to repair the damage youve done.Why, Bobbie said, looking Thorsson in the eye for the first time since coming in, am I here?Thorssons hint of a smile disappeared and was replaced by an equally understated frown.Excuse me?Why am I here?she repeated, thinking past the disciplinary board.Thinking of how hard it would be to get reassigned to Ganymede if Thorsson didnt send her back to Mars.If he didnt, would she be allowed to resign?Just leave the corps and buy her own ticket?The thought of no longer being a marine made her sad.The first really strong feeling shed had in a while.Why are you  Thorsson started, but Bobbie cut him off.Not to talk about the monster, apparently.Honestly, if Im just here as a showpiece, I think Id rather be sent home.I have some things I could be doing  You, Thorsson said, his voice getting tighter, are here to do exactly what I say for you to do, and exactly when I say it.Is that understood, soldier?Yeah, Bobbie said, feeling the water slide past her.She was a stone.It moved her not at all.I have to go now.She turned and walked away, Thorsson not managing to get a last word out before she left.As she moved through the suite toward the exit, she saw Martens pouring powdered creamer into a cup of coffee in the small kitchen area.He spotted her at the same time.Bobbie, he said.Hed gotten a lot more familiar with her over the last few days.Normally, shed have assumed it was a buildup to romantic or sexual overtures.With Martens, she was pretty sure it was just another tool in his how to fix broken marines tool kit.Captain, she said.She stopped.She felt the front door tugging at her with a sort of psychic gravity, but Martens had never been anything but good to her.And she had a strange premonition that she was never going to see any of these people again.She held out her hand to him, and when he took it, she said, Im leaving.You wont have to waste your time with me anymore.He smiled his sad smile at her.In spite of the fact that I dont actually feel like Ive accomplished anything, I dont feel like I wasted my time.Do we part friends?I  she started, then had to stop and swallow a lump in her throat.I hope this didnt wreck your career or anything.Im not worried about it, he said to her back.She was already walking out the door.She didnt turn around.In the hallway Bobbie pulled out her terminal and called the number Avasarala had given her.It immediately went to voice mail.Okay, she said, Ill take that job.There was something liberating and terrifying about the first day on a new job.In any new assignment, Bobbie had always had the unsettling feeling that she was in over her head, that she wouldnt know how to do any of the things they would ask her to do, that she would dress wrong or say the wrong thing, or that everyone would hate her.But no matter how strong that feeling was, it was overshadowed by the sense that with a new job came the chance to totally recreate herself in whatever image she chose, that at least for a little while her options were infinite.Even waiting for Avasarala finally to notice her couldnt fully dampen that feeling.Standing in Avasaralas office reinforced Bobbies impression that the Martian suite was intended to impress.The deputy secretary was important enough to get Bobbie transferred out of Thorssons command and into a liaison role for the UN with a single phone call.And yet her office had cheap carpet that smelled unpleasantly of stale tobacco smoke.Her desk was old and scuffed.No cherrywood chairs here.The only things that looked lovingly tended in the room were the fresh flowers and the Buddha shrine.Avasarala radiated weariness.There were dark circles under her eyes that hadnt been there during their official meetings and hadnt been visible in the dim lights of the bar where shed made her offer.Sitting behind her giant desk in a bright blue sari, she looked very small, like a child pretending to be a grown up.Only the gray hair and crows feet ruined the illusion.Bobbie suddenly pictured her instead as a cranky doll, complaining as children moved her arms and legs and forced her to go to tea parties with stuffed animals.The thought made her cheeks ache from restraining the grin.Avasarala tapped at a terminal on her desk and grunted with irritation.No more tea for you, gramma dolly, youve had enough, Bobbie thought, then stifled a laugh.Soren, youve moved my fucking files again.I cant find a goddamned thing anymore.The stiff young man whod brought Bobbie into the office and then sort of melted into the background cleared his throat.It made Bobbie jump.He was closer behind her than shed realized.Maam, you asked me to move a few of the   Yes, yes, Avasarala interrupted, tapping harder on the terminals screen, as if that would make the device understand what she wanted.Something about that made Bobbie think of people who started talking louder when trying to communicate with someone who spoke a different language.Okay, there they are, Avasarala said with irritation.Why youd put them  She tapped a few more times and Bobbies terminal chimed.That, she said, is the report and all of my notes on the Ganymede situation.Read them.Today.I may have an update later, once Ive had a little polite questioning done.Bobbie pulled out her terminal and scrolled quickly through the documents shed just been sent.It went on and on for hundreds of pages.Her first thought was Did she really mean read all of this today?This was quickly followed by Did she really just hand me everything she knows?It made her own governments recent treatment of her look even worse.It wont take you long, her new boss continued.Theres almost nothing there.Lots of bullshit by overpaid consultants who think they can hide the fact that they dont actually know anything by talking twice as long.Bobbie nodded, but the feeling of being in over her head had started to outcompete her excitement at a new opportunity.Maam, is Sergeant Draper cleared to access  Soren said.Yes.I just cleared her.Bobbie?Youre cleared, Avasarala said right over the top of him.Stop busting my balls, Soren.Im out of tea.Bobbie made a conscious effort not to turn around and look at Soren.The situation was uncomfortable enough without driving home the fact that hed just been humiliated in front of a foreigner with exactly seventeen minutes on the job.Yes, maam, Soren said.But I was wondering whether you should alert the security service about your decision to clear the sergeant.They do like to be in the loop on that kind of thing.Meow meow cry meow meow, Avasarala said.Thats all I heard you say.Yes, maam, Soren said.Bobbie finally looked back and forth between them.Soren was being dressed down in front of a new team member who was also technically the enemy.His expression hadnt changed.He looked like he was humoring a demented grandmother.Avasarala made an impatient clicking sound with her teeth.Was I not clear?Have I lost the ability to speak?No, maam, Soren said.Bobbie?Can you understand me?Y yes, sir.Good.Then get out of my office and do your jobs.Bobbie, read.Soren, tea.Bobbie turned to leave and found Soren staring at her, his face expressionless.Which was, in its way, more disconcerting than a little well justified anger would have been.As she walked past him, Avasarala said, Soren, wait.Take this to Foster in data services.She handed Soren what looked like a memory stick.Make sure you get it to him before he leaves for the day.Soren nodded, smiled, and took the small black wafer from her.Of course.When he and Bobbie had left Avasaralas office, and Soren had closed the door behind them, Bobbie let out a long whistling exhale and smiled at him.Wow, that was awkward.Sorry about  she started, but stopped when Soren held up his hand, casually dismissing her concern.Its nothing, he said.Shes actually having a pretty good day.While she stood gaping and looking at him, Soren turned away from her and tossed the memory stick onto his desk, where it slid under the wrapper of a half eaten package of cookies.He sat down and put on a headset, then began scrolling through a list of phone numbers on his desktop terminal.If he noticed her continued presence, he gave no sign.You know, Bobbie said finally, I just have some stuff to read, so if youre busy, I could take that thing to the data services guy.I mean, if youre busy with other stuff.Soren finally looked at her quizzically.Why would I need you to do that?Well, Bobbie said, glancing at the time on her terminal, its pretty close to eighteen hundred local, and I dont know what time you guys usually close up shop, so I just thought   Dont worry about it.The thing is, my whole job is making her he jerked his head toward the closed door calm and happy.With her, everythings top priority.And so nothing is, you know?Ill do it when it needs doing.Until then, the bitch can bark a little if it makes her feel happy.Bobbie felt a cool rush of surprise.No, not surprise.Shock.You just called her a bitch?What would you call her, right?Soren said with a disarming grin.Or was it mocking?Was this all a joke to him, Avasarala and Bobbie and the monster on Ganymede too?An image popped into her head of snatching the smug little assistant out of his chair and snapping him into a zigzag shape.Her hands flexed involuntarily.Instead, she said, Madam Secretary seemed to think it was pretty important.Soren turned to look at her again.Dont worry about it, Bobbie.Seriously.I know how to do my job.She stood for a long moment.Solid copy on that, she said.Bobbie was yanked from a dead sleep by sudden blaring music.She lurched upright in an unfamiliar bed in a nearly pitch black room.The only light she could see was a faint pulsing pearly glow from her hand terminal, all the way across the room.The music suddenly stopped sounding like an atonal cacophony and became the song shed selected as the audio alarm for incoming phone calls when she went to bed.Someone was calling.She cursed them in three languages and tried to crawl across the bed toward the terminal.The edge of the bed came unexpectedly and plunged her face first toward the floor, her half asleep body not compensating for Earths heavier gravity.She managed to avoid breaking her head open at the cost of a pair of jammed fingers on her right hand.Cursing even louder, she continued her trek across the floor to the still glowing terminal.When she finally reached it, she opened the connection and said, If someone isnt dead, someone will be.Bobbie, the person on the other end said.It took Bobbies fuzzy head a moment to place the voice.Soren.She glanced at the time on her terminal and saw that it was 0411.She wondered if he was calling to drunkenly upbraid her or apologize.It certainly wouldnt be the strangest thing thatd happened over the last twenty four hours.Bobbie realized he was still talking, and put the speaker back up to her ear.is expecting you soonest, so get down here, Soren said.Can you repeat that?He started speaking slowly, as though to a dim child.The boss wants you to come to the office, okay?Bobbie looked at the time again.Right now?No, Soren said.Tomorrow at the normal time.She just wanted me to call at four a. m.  to make sure you were coming.The flash of anger helped wake her up.Bobbie stopped gritting her teeth long enough to say, Tell her Ill be right there.She fumbled her way to a wall, and then along it to a panel, which lit up at her touch.A second touch brought up the rooms lights.Avasarala had gotten her a small furnished apartment within walking distance of the office.It wasnt much bigger than a cheap rent hole on Ceres.One large room that doubled as living space and bedroom, a smaller room with a shower and toilet, and an even smaller room that pretended to be a kitchen.Bobbies duffel lay slumped in the corner, a few items pulled out of it, but mostly still packed.Shed stayed up till one in the morning reading and hadnt bothered to do anything after that but brush her teeth and then collapse into the bed that pulled down from the ceiling.As she stood surveying the room and trying to wake up, Bobbie had a sudden moment of total clarity.It was as though a pair of dark glasses she hadnt even known she was wearing were snatched away, leaving her blinking in the light.Here she was, climbing out of bed after three hours of sleep to meet with one of the most powerful women in the solar system, and all she cared about was that she hadnt gotten her quarters shipshape and that she really wanted to beat one of her coworkers to death with his brass pen set.Oh, and she was a career marine whod taken a job working with her governments current worst enemy because someone in naval intelligence had been mean to her.And not least of all, she wanted to get back to Ganymede and kill someone without having the foggiest idea who that someone might be.The abrupt and crystal clear vision of how far off the tracks her life seemed to have fallen lasted for a few seconds, and then the fog and sleep deprivation returned, leaving her with only the disquieting feeling that shed forgotten to do something important.She dressed in the prior days uniform and rinsed her mouth out, then headed out the door.Avasaralas modest office was packed with people.Bobbie recognized at least three civilians from her first meeting there on Earth.One of them was the moonfaced man who shed later learned was Sadavir Errinwright, Avasaralas boss and possibly the second most powerful man on Earth.The pair were in an intense conversation when she came in, and Avasarala didnt see her.Bobbie spotted a small clump of people in military uniforms and drifted in their direction until she saw that they were generals and admirals, and changed course.She wound up next to Soren, the only other person in the room standing alone.He didnt even give her a glance, but something about the way he held himself seemed to radiate that disquieting charm, powerful and insincere.It struck Bobbie that Soren was the kind of man she might take to bed if she was drunk enough, but shed never trust him to watch her back in a fight.On second thought, no, shed never be drunk enough.Draper!Avasarala called out in a loud voice, having finally noticed her arrival.Yes, maam, Bobbie said, taking a step forward as everyone in the room stopped talking to look at her.Youre my liaison, Avasarala said, the bags under her eyes so pronounced they looked less like fatigue and more like an undiagnosed medical condition.So fucking liaise.Call your people.What happened?The situation around Ganymede has just turned into the shit storm to end all shit storms, she said.Were in a shooting war.Twenty One: Prax  Prax knelt, his arms zip tied securely behind him.His shoulders ached.It hurt to hold his head up and it hurt to let it sink down.Amos lay facedown on the floor.Prax thought he was dead until he saw the zip ties holding his arms behind his back.The nonlethal round their kidnappers had fired into the back of the mechanics head had left an enormous blue and black lump there.Most of the others Holden, some of the Pinkwater mercenaries, even Naomi were in positions much like his own, but not all.Four years before, theyd had a moth infestation.A containment study had failed, and inch long gray brown miller moths had run riot in his dome.Theyd built a heat trap: a few dabs of generated pheromones on a heat resistant fiber swatch under the big long wave full spectrum lighting units.The moths came too close, and the heat killed them.The smell of small bodies burning had fouled the air for days, and the scent was exactly like that of the cauterizing drill their abductors were using on the injured Pinkwater man.A swirl of white smoke rose from the formed plastic office table on which he was laid out.Im just the Pinkwater man said through his sedation haze.You just go ahead, finish that without me.Ill be over  Another bleeder, one of their abductors said.She was a thick featured woman with a mole under her left eye and blood slicked rubber gloves.Right there.Check.Got it, said the man with the drill, pressing the metal tip back down into the patients open belly wound.The sharp tapping sound of electrical discharge, and another small plume of white smoke rising from the wound.Amos rolled over suddenly, his nose a bloody ruin, his face covered in gore.I bight be wrong about dis, Cabn, he said, the words fighting out past the bulbous mess of his nose, ut I dond dink dese fellas are station security.The room Prax had found himself in when the hood had been lifted had nothing to do with the usual atmosphere of law enforcement.It looked like an old office.The kind a safety inspector or a shipping clerk might have used in the ancient days before the cascade had started: a long desk with a built in surface terminal, a few recessed lights shining up on the ceiling, a dead plant  Sanseviera trifasciata with long green brown leaves turning to dark slime.The gray armored guards or soldiers or whatever they were had been very methodical and efficient.Prisoners were all along one wall, bound at the ankles and wrists; their hand terminals, weapons, and personal effects were stowed along the opposite wall with two guards set to do nothing but make sure no one touched them.The armor theyd stripped off Holden and Amos was in a pile on the floor next to their guns.Then the pair that Prax thought of as the medical team had started working, caring for the most desperately wounded first.They hadnt had time yet to go on to anybody else.Any idea who were dealing with here?Wendell asked under his breath.Not OPA, Holden said.That leaves a pretty large number of suspects, the Pinkwater captain said.Is there somebody youve pissed off I should know about?Holdens eyes took on a pained expression and he made a motion as close to a shrug as he could manage, given the circumstances.Theres kind of a list, he said.Another bleeder here, the woman said.Check, the drill man said.Tap, smoke, the smell of burning flesh.No offense meant, Captain Holden, Wendell said, but Im starting to wish Id just shot you when I had the chance.None taken, Holden replied with a nod.Four of the soldiers came back into the room.They were all squat Earther types.One a dark skinned man with a fringe of gray hair and an air of command was subvocalizing madly.His gaze passed over the prisoners, seeing them without seeing them.Like they were boxes.When his eyes were on Prax, the man nodded but not to him.Are they stable?the dark skinned man asked the medical team.If I had the choice, the woman said, I wouldnt move this one.If you didnt?Hell probably make it.Keep the high g to a minimum until I can get him to a real medical bay.Excuse me, Holden said.Can someone please tell me what the hells going on?He might as well have been asking the walls.Weve got ten minutes, the dark skinned man said.Transport ship?Not yet.The secure facility.Splendid, the woman said sourly.Because if you want to ask us any questions, Holden said, we should start by getting everybody off Ganymede.If you want your people to still be people, we have to go.That lab we were in had the protomolecule.I want them moved two at a time, the dark skinned man said.Yes, sir, the woman replied.Are you listening to me?Holden shouted.The protomolecule is loose on this station.Theyre not listening to us, Jim, Naomi said.Ferguson.Mott, the dark skinned man said.Report.The room was silent as someone somewhere reported in.My daughters missing, Prax said.That ship took my daughter.They werent listening to him either.He hadnt expected them to.With the exception of Holden and his crew, no one had.The dark skinned man hunched forward, his expression profoundly focused.Prax felt the hair on the back of his neck rise.A premonition.Repeat that, the dark skinned man said.And then a moment later: Were firing?Whos we?Someone answered.The medical team and the weapons guards had their eyes on the commander too.Their faces were poker blank.Understood.Alpha team, new orders.Get to the port and secure a transport ship.Use of force is authorized.Repeat that: Use of force is authorized.Sergeant Chernev, I need you to cut the prisoners leg restraints.One of the gun guards did a double take.All of them, sir?All of them.And were going to need a gurney for this gentleman.Whats going on, sir?the sergeant asked, his voice strained by confusion and fear.Whats going on is Im giving you an order, the dark skinned man said, striding fast out the door.Now go.Prax felt the knife slash as a rough vibration against his ankles.He hadnt realized his feet were numb until the burning pins and needles sensation brought tears to his eyes.Standing hurt.In the distance, something boomed like an empty freight container dropped from a great height.The sergeant cut Amos legs free from their bonds and moved on to Naomi.One guard still stood by the supplies.The medical team was sealing the gut shot mans belly closed with a sweet smelling gel.The sergeant bent over.The glance between Holden and Amos was the only warning Prax had.As casually as a man heading for the restroom, Holden started walking toward the door.Hey!the weapons guard said, lifting a rifle the size of his arm.Holden looked up innocently, all eyes upon him, while behind him Amos brought his knee up into the sergeants head.Prax yelped with surprise and the gun swung toward him.He tried to raise his hands, but they were still tied behind him.Wendell stepped forward, put a foot against the medical womans hip, and pushed her into the guards line of fire.Naomi was kneeling on the sergeants neck; his face was purple.Holden kicked the drill wielding man in the back of the knee at the same moment that Amos tackled the man with the rifle.The cauterizing drill sparked against the floor with a sound like a finger tapping against glass.Paula had the sergeants knife in her hands, backing up against one of her compatriots, sawing at the zip line around his wrists.The rifleman swung his elbow, and Amos breath went out in a whoosh.Holden dropped onto the male half of the medical team, pinning the mans arms with his knees.Amos did something Prax couldnt see, and the rifleman grunted and folded over.Paula got through the Pinkwater mans zip tie just as the medical woman scooped up the rifle.The freed man pulled the pistol from the fallen sergeants holster and leaned forward, pressing the barrel to the medical womans temple as she swung the rifle up a quarter second too late.Everyone froze.The medical woman smiled.Checkmate, she said, and lowered the rifle to the floor.It had all taken no more than ten seconds.Naomi took the knife, quickly, methodically slicing through the wrist bindings while Holden followed along behind, disabling the communication webs in the gray unmarked armor and zip tying their hands and feet.A perfect inversion of the previous situation.Prax, rubbing the feeling back into his fingers, had the absurd image of the dark skinned man coming back in and barking orders to him.Another boom came, another huge, resonating container being dropped and sounding out like a drum.I just want you to know how much I appreciate the way you looked after my people, Wendell told the pair who made up the medical team.The woman suggested something obscene and unpleasant, but she smiled while she did it.Wendell, Holden said, rummaging in the box of their belongings and then tossing a card key to the Pinkwater leader.The Somnambulist is still yours, but you need to get to her now and get the hell out of here.Preaching to the choir, Wendell said.Get that gurney.Were not leaving him behind now, and weve got to get out of here before reinforcements come.Yessir, Paula said.Wendell turned to Holden.It was interesting meeting you, Captain.Lets not do this again.Holden nodded but didnt stop putting his armor back on to shake hands.Amos did the same, then distributed their confiscated weapons and items back to them.Holden checked the magazine on his gun and then left through the same door the dark skinned man had used, Amos and Naomi on his heels.Prax had to trot to catch up.Another detonation came, this one not so distant.Prax thought he felt the ice shake under him, but it might have been his imagination.Whats whats going on?The protomolecules breaking out, Holden said, tossing a hand terminal to Naomi.The infections taking hold.I dond dink dat whas habning, Cabn, Amos said.With a grimace he grabbed his nose with his right hand and yanked it away from his face.When he let go, it looked mostly straight.He blew a bloody colored plug of snot out of each nostril, then took a deep breath.Thats better.Alex?Naomi said into her handset.Alex, tell me this link is still up.Talk to me.Her voice was shaking.Another boom, this one louder than anything Prax had ever heard.The shaking wasnt imagined now; it threw Prax to the ground.The air had a strange smell, like overheated iron.The station lights flickered and went dark; the pale blue emergency evacuation LEDs came on.A low pressure Klaxon was sounding, its tritone blat designed to carry through thin and thinning air.When Holden spoke, he sounded almost contemplative.Or they might be bombarding the station.Ganymede Station was one of the first permanent human toeholds in the outer planets.It had been built with the long term in mind, not only in its own architecture, but also in how it would fit with the grand human expansion out into the darkness at the edge of the solar system.The possibility of catastrophe was in its DNA and had been from the beginning.It had been the safest station in the Jovian system.Just the name had once brought to mind images of newborn babies and domes filled with food crops.But the months since the mirrors fell had corroded it.Pressure doors meant to isolate atmosphere loss had been wedged open when local hydraulics had failed.Emergency supplies had been used up and not replaced.Anything of value that could be turned into food or passage on the black market had been stolen and sold.The social infrastructure of Ganymede was already in its slow, inevitable collapse.The worst of the worst case plans hadnt envisioned this.Prax stood in the arching common space where Nicola and he had gone on their first date.Theyd eaten together at a little dulceria, drinking coffee and flirting.He could still remember the shape of her face and the heart stopping thrill hed felt when she took his hand.The ice where the dulceria had been was a fractured chaos.A dozen passages intersected here, and people were streaming through them, trying to get to the port or else deep enough into the moon that the ice would shield them, or someplace they could tell themselves was safe.The only home hed really known was falling apart around him.Thousands of people were going to die in the next few hours.Prax knew that, and part of him was horrified by it.But Mei had been on that ship, so she wasnt one of them.He still had to rescue her, just not from this.It made it bearable.Alex says its hot out there, Naomi said as the four of them trotted through the ruins.Really hot.Hes not going to be able to make it to the port.Theres the other landing pad, Prax said.We could go there.Thats the plan, Holden said.Give Alex the coordinates for the science base.Yes, sir, Naomi said at the same moment Amos, raising a hand like a kid in a schoolroom, said, The one with the protomolecule?Its the only secret landing pad Ive got, Holden said.Yeah, all right.When Holden turned to Prax, his face was gray with strain and fear.Okay, Prax.Youre the local.Our armor is vacuum rated, but well need environment suits for you and Naomi.Were about to run through hell, and not all of its going to be pressurized.I dont have time to take a wrong turn or look for something twice.Youre point.Can you handle it?Yes, Prax said.Finding the emergency environment suits was easy.They were common enough to have essentially no resale value and stowed at brightly colored emergency stations.All the supplies in the main halls and corridors were already stripped, but ducking down a narrow side corridor that linked to the less popular complex where Prax used to take Mei to the skating rink was easy.The suits there were safety orange and green, made to be visible to rescuers.Camouflage would have been more appropriate.The masks smelled of volatile plastic, and the joints were just rings sewn into the material.The suit heaters looked ill cared for and likely to catch on fire if used too long.Another blast came, followed by two others, each sounding closer than the one before.Nukes, Naomi said.Maybe gauss rounds, Holden replied.They might have been talking about the weather.Prax shrugged.Either way, a hit that gets into a corridor means superheated steam, he said, pressing the last seal along his side closed and checking the cheap green LED that promised the oxygen was flowing.The heating system flickered to yellow, then back to green.You and Amos might make it if your armors good.I dont think Naomi and I stand a chance.Great, Holden said.Ive lost the Roci, Naomi said.No.Ive lost the whole link.I was routing through the Somnambulist.She must have taken off.Or been slagged.The thought was on all their faces.No one said it.Over this way, Prax said.Theres a service tunnel we used to use when I was in college.We can get around the Marble Arch complex and head up from there.Whatever you say, buddy, Amos said.His nose was bleeding again.The blood looked black in the faint blue light inside his helmet.It was his last walk.Whatever happened, Prax was never coming back here, because here wouldnt exist.The fast lope along the service corridor where Jaimie Loomis and Tanna Ibtrahmin Sook had taken him to get high was the last time hed see that place.The broad, low ceilinged amphitheater under the old water treatment center where hed had his first internship was cracked, the reservoir compromised.It wouldnt flood the corridors quickly, but in a couple of days, the passageways would be filled in.In a couple of days, it wouldnt matter.Everything glowed in the emergency LEDs or else fell into shadow.There was slush on the ground as the heating system struggled to compensate for the madness and failed.Twice, the way was blocked, once by a pressure door that was actually still functional, once by an icefall.They met almost no one.The others were all running for the port.Prax was leading them almost directly away from it now.Another long, curved hall, then up a construction ramp, through an empty tunnel, and  The blue steel door that blocked their way wasnt locked, but it was in safety mode.The indicator said there was vacuum on the other side.One of the God like fists pummeling Ganymede had broken through here.Prax stopped, his mind clicking through the three dimensional architecture of his home station.If the secret base was there, and he was here, then  We cant get there, he said.The others were silent for a moment.Thats not a good answer, Holden said.Find a different one.Prax took a long breath.If they doubled back, they could go down a level, head to the west, and try getting to the corridor from below, except that a blast strong enough to break through here would almost certainly have compromised the level below too.If they kept going to the old tube station, they might be able to find a service corridor not that he knew there was one, but maybe and it might lead in the right direction.Three more detonations came, shaking the ice.With a sound like a baseball bat hitting a home run, the wall beside him cracked.Prax, buddy, Amos said, soonerd be better.They had environment suits, so if they opened the door, the vacuum wouldnt kill them.But there would be debris choking it.Any strike hard enough to break through to the surface would  Would  We cant get there through the station tunnels, he said.But we can go up.Get to the surface and go that way.And how do we do that?Holden asked.Finding an access way that wasnt locked down took twenty minutes, but Prax found one.No wider than three men walking abreast, it was an automated service unit for the dome exteriors.The service unit itself had long since been cannibalized for parts, but that didnt matter.The airlock was still working under battery power.Naomi and Prax fed it the instructions, closed the inner door, and cycled the outer open.The escaping pressure was like a wind for a moment, and then nothing.Prax walked out onto the surface of Ganymede.Hed seen images of the aurora from Earth.Hed never imagined hed see anything like it in the blackness of his own sky.But there, not just above him but in lines from horizon to horizon, were streaks of green and blue and gold chaff and debris and the radiating gas of cooling plasma.Incandescent blooms marked torch drives.Several kilometers away, a gauss round slammed into the moons surface, the seismic shock knocking them from their feet.Prax lay there for a moment, watching the water ejecta geyser up into the darkness and then begin to fall back down as snow.It was beautiful.The rational, scientific part of his mind tried to calculate how much energy transfer there was to the moon when a rail gun hurled chunk of tungsten hit it.It would be like a miniature nuke without all the messy radiation.He wondered if the round would stop before it hit Ganymedes nickel iron core.Okay, Holden said over the cheap radio in Praxs emergency suit.The low end of the sound spectrum was lousy, and Holden sounded like a cartoon character.Which way now?I dont know, Prax said, rising to his knees.He pointed toward the horizon.Over there somewhere.I need more than that, Holden said.Ive never been on the surface before, Prax said.In a dome, sure.But just out?I mean, I know were close to it, but I dont know how to get there.All right, Holden said.In the high vacuum over his head, something huge and very far away detonated.It was like the old cartoon lightbulb of someone getting an idea.We can do this.We can solve this.Amos, you head toward that hill over there, see what you can see.Prax and Naomi, start going that direction.I dont think we need to do that, sir, Naomi said.Why not?Naomi raised her hand, pointing back behind Holden and Prax both.Because Im pretty sure thats the Roci setting down over there, she said.Twenty Two: Holden  The secret landing pad lay in the hollow of a small crater.When Holden crested the lip and saw the Rocinante below him, the sudden and dizzying release of tension told him how frightened hed been for the last several hours.But the Roci was home, and no matter how hard his rational mind argued that they were still in terrible danger, home was safe.As he paused a moment to catch his breath, the scene was lit with bright white light, like someone had taken a picture.Holden looked up in time to see a fading cloud of glowing gas in high orbit.People were still dying in space just over their heads.Wow, Prax said.Its bigger than I expected.Corvette, Amos replied, obvious pride in his voice.Frigate class fleet escort ship.I dont know what any of that means, Prax said.It looks like a big chisel with an upside down coffee cup on the back.Amos said, Thats the drive   Enough, Holden cut in.Get to the airlock.Amos led the way, sliding down the craters icy wall hunched down on his heels and using his hands for balance.Prax went next, for once not needing any help.Naomi went third, her reflexes and balance honed by a lifetime spent in shifting gravities.She actually managed to look graceful.Holden went last, fully prepared to slip and go down the hill in a humiliating tumble, then pleasantly surprised when he didnt.As they bounded across the flat floor of the crater toward the ship, the outer airlock door slid open, revealing Alex in a suit of Martian body armor and carrying an assault rifle.As soon as they were close enough to the ship that they could cut through the orbital radio clutter, Holden said, Alex!Man, is it good to see you.Hey, Cap, Alex replied, even his exaggerated drawl not able to hide the relief in his voice.Wasnt sure how hot this LZ would be.Anyone chasin you?Amos ran up the ramp and grabbed Alex in a bear hug that yanked him off his feet.Man, its fucking good to be home!he said.Prax and Naomi followed, Naomi patting Alex on the shoulder as she went by.You did good.Thank you.Holden stopped on the ramp to look up one last time.The sky was still filled with the flashes and light trails of ongoing battle.He had the sudden visceral memory of being a boy back in Montana, watching massive thunderheads flash with hidden lightning.Alex watched with him, then said, It was a bit hectic, comin in.Holden threw an arm around his shoulder.Thanks for the ride.Once the airlock had finished cycling and the crew had removed their environment suits and armor, Holden said, Alex, this is Prax Meng.Prax, this is the solar systems best pilot, Alex Kamal.Prax shook Alexs hand.Thank you for helping me find Mei.Alex frowned a question at Holden, but a quick shake of the head kept him from asking it.Nice to meet you, Prax.Alex, Holden said, get us warmed up for liftoff, but dont take off until Im up in the copilots chair.Roger, Alex said, and headed toward the bow of the ship.Everythings sideways, Prax said, looking around at the storage room just past the inner airlock door.The Roci doesnt spend much time on her belly like this, Naomi said, taking his hand and leading him to the crew ladder, which now appeared to run across the floor.Were standing on a bulkhead, and that wall to our right is normally the deck.Grew up in low grav and dont spend much time on ships, apparently, Amos said.Man, this next part is really gonna suck for you.Naomi, Holden said.Get to ops and get belted in.Amos, take Prax to the crew deck and then head down to engineering and get the Roci ready for a rough ride.Before they could leave, Holden put a hand on Praxs shoulder.This takeoff and flight is going to be fast and bumpy.If you havent trained for high g flight, it will probably be very uncomfortable.Dont worry about me, Prax said, making what he probably thought was a brave face.I know youre tough.You couldnt have survived the last couple weeks otherwise.You dont have anything to prove at this point.Amos will take you to the crew deck.Find a room without a name on the door.That will be your room now.Get in the crash couch and buckle in, then hit the bright green button on the panel to your left.The couch will pump you full of drugs that will sedate you and keep you from blowing a blood vessel if we have to burn hard.My room?Prax said, an odd note in his voice.Well get you some clothes and sundries once were out of this shit.You can keep them there.My room, Prax repeated.Yeah, Holden said.Your room.He could see Prax fighting down a lump in his throat, and he realized what the simple offer of comfort and safety probably meant to someone whod been through what the small botanist had over the last month.There were tears in the mans eyes.Come on, lets get you settled in, Amos said, leading Prax aft toward the crew deck.Holden headed the other way, past the ops deck, where Naomi was already strapped down into a chair at one of the workstations, then forward into the cockpit.He climbed into the copilots seat and belted in.Five minutes, he said over the shipwide channel.So, Alex said, dragging the word out to two syllables while he flicked switches to finish the preflight check, were lookin for someone named Mei?Praxs daughter.We do that now?Seems like the scope of our mission is creepin a bit.Holden nodded.Finding lost daughters was not part of their mandate.That had been Millers job.And hed never be able to adequately explain the certainty he felt that this lost little girl was at the center of everything that had happened on Ganymede.I think this lost little girl is at the center of everything thats happened on Ganymede, he said with a shrug.Okay, Alex replied, then hit something on a panel twice and frowned.Huh, we have a red on the board.Gettin a no seal on the cargo airlock.Mightve caught some flak on the way down, I guess.It was pretty hot up there.Well, were not going to stop and fix it now, Holden said.We keep the bay in vacuum most of the time anyway.If the inner hatch into the cargo area is showing a good seal, just override the alarm and lets go.Roger, Alex said, and tapped the override.One minute, Holden said over the shipwide, then turned to Alex.So Im curious.Bout?Howd you manage to slip through that shit storm up above us, and can you do it again on the way out?Alex laughed.Simple matter of never bein higher than the second highest threat on anyones board.And, of course, not bein there anymore when they decide to get around to you.Im giving you a raise, Holden said, then began the ten second countdown.At one, the Roci blasted off of Ganymede on four pillars of superheated steam.Rotate us for a full burn as soon as you can, Holden said, the rumble of the ships takeoff giving him an artificial vibrato.This close?Theres nothing below us that matters, Holden said, thinking of the remnants of black filament theyd seen in the hidden base.Melt it.Okay, Alex said.Then, once the ship had finished orienting straight up, he said, Givin her the spurs.Even with the juice coursing through his blood, Holden blacked out for a moment.When he came to, the Roci was veering wildly from side to side.The cockpit was alive with the sounds of warning buzzers.Whoa, honey, Alex was saying under his breath.Whoa, big girl.Naomi, Holden said, looking at a confusing mass of red on the threat board and trying to decipher it with his blood starved brain.Whos firing at us?Everyone.She sounded as groggy as he felt.Yeah, Alex said, his tension draining some of the good old boy drawl out of his voice.Shes not kidding.The swarm of threats on his display began to make sense, and Holden saw they were right.It looked like half of the inner planets ships on their side of Ganymede had lobbed at least one missile at them.He entered the command code to set all the weapons to free fire and sent control of the aft PDCs to Amos.Amos, cover our asses.Alex was doing his best to keep any of the incoming missiles from catching them, but ultimately that was a lost cause.Nothing with meat inside it could outrun metal and silicon.Where are we  Holden said, stopping to target a missile that wandered into the front starboard PDCs firing arc.The point defense cannon fired off a long burst at it.The missile was smart enough to turn sharply and evade, but its sudden course change bought them a few more seconds.Callistos on our side of Jupiter, Alex said, referring to the next sizable moon out from Ganymede.Gonna get in its shadow.Holden checked the vectors of the ships that had fired at them.If any of them were pursuing, Alexs gambit would only buy them a few minutes.But it didnt appear they were.Of the dozen or so that had attacked them, over half were moderately to severely damaged, and the ones that werent were still busy shooting at each other.Seems like we were everyones number one threat there for a second, Holden said.But not so much anymore.Yeah, sorry about that, Cap.Not sure why that happened.I dont blame you, Holden said.The Roci shuddered, and Amos gave a whoop over the shipwide comm.Dont be trying to touch my girls ass!Two of the closer missiles had vanished off the threat board.Nice work, Amos, Holden said, checking the updated times to impact and seeing that theyd bought another half minute.Shit, Cap, the Roci does all the work, Amos said.I just encourage her to express herself.Going to duck and cover around Callisto.Id appreciate a distraction, Alex said to Holden.Okay, Naomi, another ten seconds or so, Holden said.Then hit them with everything youve got.Well need them blind for a few seconds.Roger, Naomi said.Holden could see her prepping a massive assault package of laser clutter and radio jamming.The Rocinante lurched again, and the moon Callisto suddenly filled Holdens forward screen.Alex hurtled toward it at a suicidal rate, flipping the ship and hard burning at the last second to throw them into a low slingshot orbit.Three two one now, he said, the Roci diving tail first toward Callisto, whipping past it so low that Holden felt like he could have reached out the airlock and scooped up some snow.At the same time, Naomis jamming package hammered the sensors of the pursuing missiles, blinding them while their processors worked to cut through the noise.By the time theyd reacquired the Rocinante, shed been thrown around Callisto by gravity and her own drive in a new vector and at high speed.Two of the missiles gamely tried to come about and pursue, but the rest either limped off in random directions or slammed into the moon.When their two pursuers had gotten back on course, the Roci had opened up an enormous lead and could take her time shooting them down.We made it, Alex said.Holden found the disbelief in his pilots voice fairly disconcerting.Had it been that close?Never doubted it, Holden said.Take us to Tycho.Half a g.  Ill be in my cabin.When they were finished, Naomi flopped onto her side in their shared bunk, sweat plastering her curly black hair to her forehead.She was still panting.He was too.That was vigorous, she said.Holden nodded but didnt have enough air to actually speak yet.When hed climbed down the ladder from the cockpit, Naomi had been waiting, already out of her restraints.Shed grabbed him and kissed him so hard his lip had split.He hadnt even noticed.Theyd barely reached the cabin with their clothes on.What had happened afterward was sort of a blur now to Holden, though his legs were tired and his lip hurt.Naomi rolled across him and climbed out of the bunk.Ive got to pee, she said, pulling on a robe and heading out the door.Holden just nodded to her, still not quite capable of speech.He shifted over to the middle of the bed, stretching out his arms and legs for a moment.The truth was the Rocis cabins were not built for two occupants, least of all the crash couches that doubled as beds.But over the course of the last year, hed spent more and more time sleeping in Naomis cabin, until it sort of became their cabin and he just didnt sleep anywhere else anymore.They couldnt share the bunk during high g maneuvers, but so far theyd never been asleep anytime the ship had needed to do high g maneuvering.A trend that was likely to continue.Holden was starting to doze off when the hatch opened and Naomi came back in.She tossed a cold, wet washcloth onto his belly.Wow, thats bracing, Holden said, sitting up with a start.It was hot when I left the head with it.That, Holden said while he cleaned up, sounded very dirty.Naomi grinned, then sat on the edge of the bunk and poked him in the ribs.You can still think of sex?I wouldve thought we got that out of your system.A close brush with death does wonderful things for my refractory period.Naomi climbed into the bunk next to him, still wrapped in her robe.You know, she said, this was my idea.And Im all in favor of reaffirming life through sex.Why do I get the feeling that there is a but missing at the end of that sentence?But   Ah, there it is.Theres something we need to talk about.And this seems a good time.Holden rolled over onto his side, facing her, and pushed up onto one elbow.A thick strand of hair was hanging in her face, and he brushed it back with his other hand.What did I do?he said.Its not exactly anything youve done, Naomi said.Its more what were heading off to do right now.Holden put his hand on her arm but waited for her to continue.The soft cloth of her robe clung to the wet skin beneath it.Im worried, she said, that were flying off to Tycho to do something really rash.
