 Festival Night      Mars was empty before we came.Thats not to say that nothing had ever happened.The planet had accreted, melted, roiled and cooled, leaving a surface scarred by enormous geological features: craters, canyons, volcanoes.But all of that happened in mineral unconsciousness, and unobserved.There were no witnesses except for us, looking from the planet next door, and that only in the last moment of its long history.We are all the consciousness that Mars has ever had.Now everybody knows the history of Mars in the human mind: how for all the generations of prehistory it was one of the chief lights in the sky, because of its redness and fluctuating intensity, and the way it stalled in its wandering course through the stars, and sometimes even reversed direction.It seemed to be saying something with all that.So perhaps it is not surprising that all the oldest names for Mars have a peculiar weight on the tongue Nirgal, Mangala, Auqakuh, Harmakhis they sound as if they were even older than the ancient languages we find them in, as if they were fossil words from the Ice Age or before.Yes, for thousands of years Mars was a sacred power in human affairs; and its color made it a dangerous power, representing blood, anger, war and the heart.Then the first telescopes gave us a closer look, and we saw the little orange disk, with its white poles and dark patches spreading and shrinking as the long seasons passed.No improvement in the technology of the telescope ever gave us much more than that; but the best Earthbound images gave Lowell enough blurs to inspire a story, the story we all know, of a dying world and a heroic people, desperately building canals to hold off the final deadly encroachment of the desert.It was a great story.But then Mariner and Viking sent back their photos, and everything changed.Our knowledge of Mars expanded by magnitudes, we literally knew millions of times more about this planet than we had before.And there before us flew a new world, a world unsuspected.It seemed, however, to be a world without life.People searched for signs of past or present Martian life, anything from microbes to the doomed canal builders, or even alien visitors.As you know, no evidence for any of these has ever been found.And so stories have naturally blossomed to fill the gap, just as in Lowells time, or in Homers, or in the caves or on the savannah stories of microfossils wrecked by our bio organisms, of ruins found in dust storms and then lost forever, of Big Man and all his adventures, of the elusive little red people, always glimpsed out of the corner of the eye.And all of these tales are told in an attempt to give Mars life, or to bring it to life.Because we are still those animals who survived the Ice Age, and looked up at the night sky in wonder, and told stories.And Mars has never ceased to be what it was to us from our very beginning a great sign, a great symbol, a great power.And so we came here.It had been a power; now it became a place.And so we came here.But what they didnt realize was that by the time we got to Mars, we would be so changed by the voyage out that nothing we had been told to do mattered anymore.It wasnt like submarining or settling the Wild West it was an entirely new experience, and as the flight of the Ares went on, the Earth finally became so distant that it was nothing but a blue star among all the others, its voices so delayed that they seemed to come from a previous century.We were on our own; and so we became fundamentally different beings.All lies, Frank Chalmers thought irritably.He was sitting in a row of dignitaries, watching his old friend John Boone give the usual Boone Inspirational Address.It made Chalmers weary.The truth was the trip to Mars had been the functional equivalent of a long train ride.Not only had they not become fundamentally different beings, they had actually become more like themselves than ever, stripped of habits until they were left with nothing but the naked raw material of their selves.But John stood up there waving a forefinger at the crowd, saying, We came here to make something new, and when we arrived our earthly differences fell away, irrelevant in this new world!Yes, he meant it all literally.His vision of Mars was a lens that distorted everything he saw, a kind of religion.He would spout the same nonsense in private conversation, no matter how you rolled your eyes.Chalmers stopped listening and let his gaze wander over the new city.They were going to call it Nicosia.It was the first town of any size to be built freestanding on the Martian surface; all the buildings were set inside what was in effect an immense clear tent, supported by a nearly invisible frame, and placed on the rise of Tharsis, west of Noctis Labyrinthus.This location gave it a tremendous view, with a distant western horizon punctuated by the broad peak of Pavonis Mons.For the Mars veterans in the crowd it was giddy stuff: they were on the surface, they were out of the trenches and mesas and craters, they could see forever!Hurrah!A laugh from the audience drew Franks attention back to his old friend.John Boone had a slightly hoarse voice and a friendly Midwestern accent, and he was by turns (and somehow even all at once) relaxed, intense, sincere, self mocking, modest, confident, serious, and funny.In short, the perfect public speaker.And the audience was rapt; this was the First Man On Mars speaking to them, and judging by the looks on their faces they might as well have been watching Jesus produce their evening meal out of the loaves and fishes.And in fact John almost deserved their adoration for performing a similar miracle on another plane, transforming their tin can existence into an astounding spiritual voyage.On Mars we will come to care for each other more than ever before, John said, which really meant, Chalmers thought, an alarming incidence of the kind of behavior seen in rat overpopulation experiments; Mars is a sublime, exotic and dangerous place, said John meaning a frozen ball of oxidized rock on which they were exposed to about fifteen rem a year; And with our work, John continued, we are carving out a new social order and the next step in the human story i. e. , the latest variant in primate dominance dynamics.John finished with this flourish, and there was, of course, a huge roar of applause.Maya Toitovna then went to the podium to introduce Chalmers.Frank gave her a private look which meant he was in no mood for any of her jokes; she saw it and said, Our next speaker has been the fuel in our little rocket ship, which somehow got a laugh.His vision and energy are what got us to Mars in the first place, so save any complaints you may have for our next speaker, my old friend Frank Chalmers.At the podium he found himself surprised by how big the town appeared.It covered a long triangle, and they were gathered at its highest point, a park occupying the western apex.Seven paths rayed down through the park to become wide, tree lined, grassy boulevards.Between the boulevards stood low trapezoidal buildings, each faced with polished stone of a different color.The size and architecture of the buildings gave things a faintly Parisian look, Paris as seen by a drunk Fauvist in spring, sidewalk cafs and all.Four or five kilometers downslope the end of the city was marked by three slender skyscrapers, beyond which lay the low greenery of the farm.The skyscrapers were part of the tent framework, which overhead was an arched network of sky colored lines.The tent fabric itself was invisible, and so taken all in all, it appeared that they stood in the open air.That was gold, that was.Nicosia was going to be a popular city.Chalmers said as much to the audience, and enthusiastically they agreed.Apparently he had the crowd, fickle souls that they were, about as securely as John.Chalmers was bulky and dark, and he knew he presented quite a contrast to Johns blond good looks; but he knew as well that he had his own rough charisma, and as he warmed up he drew on it, falling into a selection of his own stock phrases.Then a shaft of sunlight lanced down between the clouds, striking the upturned faces of the crowd, and he felt an odd tightening in his stomach.So many people there, so many strangers!People in the mass were a frightening thing (as they were individually) all those wet ceramic alien eyes encased in pink blobs, looking at him....Usually when he spoke to an audience he picked out a few faces and the rest became visual filler, but with the sunlight coursing over his shoulder they all caught at his eye at once, and it was nearly too much.Five thousand people in a single Martian town!After all the years in Underhill it was hard to grasp.Foolishly he tried to tell the audience something of this.Looking, he said.Looking around ...the strangeness of our presence here is ...accentuated.He was losing the crowd.How to say it?How to say that they alone in all that rocky world were alive, their faces glowing like paper lanterns in the light?How to say that even if living creatures were no more than carriers for ruthless genes, this was still somehow better than the blank mineral nothingness of everything else?Of course he could never say it.Not at any time, perhaps, and certainly not in a speech.So he collected himself.In the Martian desolation, he said, the human presence is, well, a remarkable thing.(They would care for each other more than ever before, a voice in his mind repeated sardonically. )The planet, taken in itself, is a dead frozen nightmare (therefore exotic and sublime) and so thrown on our own, we of necessity are in the process of ...reorganizing a bit (or forming a new social order) so that yes, yes, yes, he found himself proclaiming exactly the same lies they had just heard from John!Ridiculous.But lies were what people wanted; that was politics.Thus at the end of his speech he too got a big roar of applause.Irritated, he announced it was time to eat, depriving Maya of her chance for a final remark.Although probably she had known he would do that and so hadnt bothered to think of any.Frank Chalmers liked to have the last word.People crowded onto the temporary platform to mingle with the celebrities.It was rare to get this many of the first hundred in one spot anymore, and people crowded around John and Maya, Samantha Hoyle, Sax Russell and Chalmers.Frank looked over the crowd at John and Maya.He didnt recognize the group of Terrans surrounding them, which made him curious.He made his way across the platform, and as he approached he saw Maya and John give each other a look.Theres no reason this place shouldnt function under normal law, one of the Terrans was saying.Maya said to him, Did Olympus Mons really remind you of Mauna Loa?Sure, the man said.Shield volcanoes all look alike.Frank stared over this idiots head at Maya.She didnt acknowledge the look.John was pretending not to have noticed Franks arrival.Samantha Hoyle was speaking to another man in an undertone, explaining something; he nodded, then glanced involuntarily at Frank.Samantha kept her back turned to him.But it was John who mattered, John and Maya.And both were pretending that nothing was out of the ordinary; but the topic of conversation, whatever it had been, had gone away.Chalmers left the platform.People were still trooping down through the park, toward tables that had been set in the upper ends of the seven boulevards.Chalmers followed them, walking under young transplanted sycamores; their khaki leaves colored the afternoon light, making the park look like the bottom of an aquarium.At the banquet tables construction workers were knocking back vodka, getting rowdy, obscurely aware that with the construction finished, the heroic age of Nicosia was ended.Perhaps that was true for all of Mars.The air filled with overlapping conversations.Frank sank beneath the turbulence, wandered out to the northern perimeter.He stopped at a waist high concrete coping: the city wall.Out of the metal stripping on its top rose four layers of clear plastic.A Swiss man was explaining things to a group of visitors, pointing happily.An outer membrane of piezoelectric plastic generates electricity from wind.Then two sheets hold a layer of airgel insulation.Then the inner layer is a radiation capturing membrane, which turns purple and must be replaced.More clear than a window, isnt it?The visitors agreed.Frank reached out and pushed at the inner membrane.It stretched until his fingers were buried to the knuckles.Slightly cool.There was faint white lettering printed on the plastic: isidis planitia polymers.Through the sycamores over his shoulder he could still see the platform at the apex.John and Maya and their cluster of Terran admirers were still there, talking animatedly.Conducting the business of the planet.Deciding the fate of Mars.He stopped breathing.He felt the pressure of his molars squeezing together.He poked the tent wall so hard that he pushed out the outermost membrane, which meant that some of his anger would be captured and stored as electricity in the towns grid.Polyvinylidene difluoride was a special polymer in that respect carbon atoms were linked to hydrogen and fluorine atoms in such a way that the resulting substance was even more piezoelectric than quartz.Change one element of the three, however, and everything shifted; substitute chlorine for fluorine, for instance, and you had saran wrap.Frank stared at his wrapped hand, then up again at the other two elements, still bonded to each other.But without him they were nothing!Angrily he walked into the narrow streets of the city.Clustered in a plaza like mussels on a rock were a group of Arabs, drinking coffee.Arabs had arrived on Mars only ten years before, but already they were a force to be reckoned with.They had a lot of money, and they had teamed up with the Swiss to build a number of towns, including this one.And they liked it on Mars.Its like a cold day in the Empty Quarter, as the Saudis said.The similarity was such that Arabic words were slipping quickly into English, because Arabic had a larger vocabulary for this landscape: akaba for the steep final slopes around volcanoes, badia for the great world dunes, nefuds for deep sand, seyl for the billion year old dry riverbeds....People were saying they might as well switch over to Arabic and have done with it.Frank had spent a fair bit of time with Arabs, and the men in the plaza were pleased to see him.Salaam aleyk!they said to him, and he replied, Marhabba!White teeth flashed under black moustaches.Only men present, as usual.Some youths led him to a central table where the older men sat, including his friend Zeyk.Zeyk said, We are going to call this square Hajr el kra Meshab, the red granite open place in town.He gestured at the rust colored flagstones.Frank nodded and asked what kind of stone it was.He spoke Arabic for as long as he could, pushing the edges of his ability and getting some good laughs in response.Then he sat at the central table and relaxed, feeling like he could have been on a street in Damascus or Cairo, comfortable in the wash of Arabic and expensive cologne.He studied the mens faces as they talked.An alien culture, no doubt about it.They werent going to change just because they were on Mars, they put the lie to Johns vision.Their thinking clashed radically with Western thought; for instance the separation of church and state was wrong to them, making it impossible for them to agree with Westerners on the very basis of government.And they were so patriarchal that some of their women were said to be illiterate illiterates, on Mars!That was a sign.And indeed these men had the dangerous look that Frank associated with machismo, the look of men who oppressed their women so cruelly that naturally the women struck back where they could, terrorizing sons who then terrorized wives who terrorized sons and so on and so on, in an endless death spiral of twisted love and sex hatred.So that in that sense they were all madmen.Which was one reason Frank liked them.And certainly they would come in useful to him, acting as a new locus of power.Defend a weak new neighbor to weaken the old powerful ones, as Machiavelli had said.So he drank coffee, and gradually, politely, they shifted to English, and by shifting with them Frank not only conceded their superiority in languages, but also found it easier to control the conversation.How did you like the speeches?he asked, looking into the black mud at the bottom of his demitasse.John Boone is the same as ever, old Zeyk replied.The others laughed angrily.When he says we will make an indigenous Martian culture, he only means some of the Terran cultures here will be promoted, and others attacked.Those perceived as regressive will be singled out for destruction.It is a form of Ataturkism.He thinks everyone on Mars should become American, said a man named Nejm.Why not?Zeyk said, smiling.Its already happened on Earth.No, Frank said.You shouldnt misunderstand Boone.People say hes self absorbed, but  He is self absorbed!Nejm cried.He lives in a hall of mirrors!He thinks that we have come to Mars to establish a good old American superculture, and that everyone will agree to it because it is the John Boone plan.Zeyk said, He doesnt understand that other people have other opinions.Its not that, Frank said.Its just that he knows they dont make as much sense as his.They laughed at that, but the younger mens hoots had a bitter edge.They all believed that before their arrival Boone had argued in secret against U. N.  approval for Arab settlements.Frank encouraged this belief, which was almost true John disliked any ideology that might get in his way.He wanted the slate as blank as possible in everybody who came up.The Arabs, however, believed that John disliked them in particular.Young Selim el Hayil opened his mouth to speak, and Frank gave him a swift warning glance.Selim froze, then pursed his mouth angrily.Frank said, Well, hes not as bad as all that.Although to tell the truth Ive heard him say it would have been better if the Americans and Russians had been able to claim the planet when they arrived, like explorers in the old days.Their laughter was brief and grim.Selims shoulders hunched as if struck.Frank shrugged and smiled, spread his hands wide.But its pointless!I mean, what can he do?Old Zeyk lifted his eyebrows.Opinions vary on that.Opinions vary on that.Yes, a lot of people had underestimated John Boone Chalmers had done it himself many times.An image came to him of John in the White House, pink with conviction, his disobedient blond hair flying wildly, the sun streaming in the Oval Office windows and illuminating him as he waved his hands and paced the room, talking away while the President nodded and his aides watched, pondering how best to co opt that electrifying charisma.Oh, they had been hot in those days, Chalmers and Boone; Frank with the ideas and John the front man, with a momentum that was practically unstoppable.It would be more a matter of derailment, really.Chalmers got up to move on, meeting for one instant Selims insistent gaze.Then he strode down a side street, one of the narrow lanes that connected the citys seven main boulevards.Most were paved with cobblestones or streetgrass, but this one was rough blond concrete.He slowed by a recessed doorway, looked in the window of a closed boot manufactory.His faint reflection appeared in a pair of bulky walker boots.Selim el Hayils reflection appeared among the boots.Is it true?he demanded.Is what true?said Frank crossly.Is Boone anti Arab?What do you think?Was he the one who blocked permission to build the mosque on Phobos?Hes a powerful man.The young Saudis face twisted.The most powerful man on Mars, and he only wants more!He wants to be king!Selim made a fist and struck his other hand.He was slimmer than the other Arabs, weak chinned, his moustache covering a small mouth.A bit of a rabbit, but with sharp teeth.The treaty comes up for renewal soon, Frank said.And Boones coalition is bypassing me.He ground his teeth.I dont know what their plans are, but Im going to find out tonight.You can imagine what theyll be, anyway.Western biases, certainly.He may withhold his approval of a new treaty unless it contains guarantees that all settlements will be made only by the original treaty signatories.Selim shivered, and Frank pressed; Its what he wants, and its very possible he could get it, because his new coalition makes him more powerful than ever.It could mean an end to settlement by nonsignatories.Youll become guest scientists.Or get sent back.In the window the reflection of Selims face appeared a kind of mask, signifying rage.Battal, battal, he was muttering.Very bad, very bad.His hands twisted as if out of his control, and he muttered about the Koran or Camus, Persepolis or the Peacock Throne, references scattered nervously among non sequiturs.Babbling.Talk means nothing, Chalmers said harshly.When it comes down to it, nothing matters but action.That gave the young Arab pause.I cant be sure, he said at last.Frank poked him in the arm, watched a shock run through the man.Its your people were talking about.Its this planet were talking about.Selims mouth disappeared under his moustache.After a time he said, Its true.Frank said nothing.They looked in the window together, as if judging boots.Finally Frank raised a hand.Ill talk to Boone again, he said quietly.Tonight.He leaves tomorrow.Ill try to talk to him, to reason with him.I doubt it will matter.It never has before.But Ill try.Afterward ...we should meet.Yes.In the park, then, the southernmost path.Around eleven.Selim nodded.Chalmers transfixed him with a stare.Talk means nothing, he said brusquely, and walked away.The next boulevard Chalmers came to was crowded with people clumped outside open front bars, or kiosks selling couscous and bratwurst.Arab and Swiss.It seemed an odd combination, but they meshed well.Tonight some of the Swiss were distributing face masks from the door of an apartment.Apparently they were celebrating this stadtfest as a kind of Mardi Gras, Fassnacht as they called it, with masks and music and every manner of social inversion, just as it was back home on those wild February nights in Basel and Zrich and Luzern....On an impulse Frank joined the line.Around every profound spirit a mask is always growing, he said to two young women in front of him.They nodded politely and then resumed conversation in guttural Schwyzerdtsch, a dialect never written down, a private code, incomprehensible even to Germans.It was another impenetrable culture, the Swiss, in some ways even more so than the Arabs.That was it, Frank thought; they worked well together because they were both so insular that they never made any real contact.He laughed out loud as he took a mask, a black face studded with red paste gems.He put it on.A line of masked celebrants snaked down the boulevard, drunk, loose, at the edge of control.At an intersection the boulevard opened up into a small plaza, where a fountain shot sun colored water into the air.Around the fountain a steel drum band hammered out a calypso tune.People gathered around, dancing or hopping in time to the low bong of the bass drum.A hundred meters overhead a vent in the tent frame poured frigid air down onto the plaza, air so cold that little flakes of snow floated in it, glinting in the light like chips of mica.Then fireworks banged just under the tenting, and colored sparks fell down through the snowflakes.It always seemed to him that sunset more than any other time of day made it clear that they stood on an alien planet; something in the slant and redness of the light was fundamentally wrong, upsetting expectations wired into the savannah brain over millions of years.This evening was providing a particularly garish and unsettling example of the phenomenon.Frank wandered in its light, making his way back to the city wall.The plain south of the city was littered with a truly Martian abundance of rocks, each one dogged by a long black shadow.Under the concrete arch of the citys south gate he stopped.No one there.The gates were locked during festivals like these, to keep drunks from going out and getting hurt.But Frank had gotten the days emergency code out of the fire department AI that morning, and when he was sure no one was watching he tapped out the code and hurried into the lock.He put on a walker, boots, and helmet, and went through the middle and outer doors.Outside it was intensely cold as always, and the diamond pattern of the walkers heating element burned through his clothes.He crunched over concrete and then duricrust.Loose sand flowed east, pushed by the wind.Grimly he looked around.Rocks everywhere.A planet sledgehammered billions of times.And meteors still falling.Someday one of the towns would take a hit.He turned and looked back.It looked like an aquarium glowing in the dusk.There would be no warning, but everything would suddenly fly apart, walls, vehicles, trees, bodies.The Aztecs had believed the world would end in one of four ways: earthquake, fire, flood, or jaguars falling from the sky.Here there would be no fire.Nor earthquake nor flood, now that he thought of it.Leaving only the jaguars.The twilight sky was a dark pink over Pavonis Mons.To the east stretched Nicosias farm, a long low greenhouse running downslope from the city.From this angle one could see that the farm was larger than the town proper, and jammed with green crops.Frank clumped to one of its outer locks, and entered.Inside the farm it was hot, a full sixty degrees warmer than outside, and fifteen degrees warmer than in the city.He had to keep his helmet on, as the farm air was tailored to the plants, heavy on CO2 and short on oxygen.He stopped at a work station and fingered through drawers of small tools and pesticide patches, gloves and bags.He selected three tiny patches and put them in a plastic bag, then slipped the bag gently into the walkers pocket.The patches were clever pesticides, biosaboteurs designed to provide plants with systemic defenses; he had been reading about them, and knew of a combination that in animals would be deadly to the organism....He put a pair of shears in the walkers other pocket.Narrow gravel paths led him up between long beds of barley and wheat, back toward the city proper.He went in the lock leading into town, unclipped his helmet, stripped off the walker and boots, transferred the contents of the walker pockets to his coat.Then he went back into the lower end of town.Here the Arabs had built a medina, insisting that such a neighborhood was crucial to a citys health; the boulevards narrowed, and between them lay warrens of twisted alleyways taken from the maps of Tunis or Algiers, or generated randomly.Nowhere could you see from one boulevard to the next, and the sky overhead was visible only in plum strips, between buildings that leaned together.Most of the alleys were empty now, as the party was uptown.A pair of cats skulked between buildings, investigating their new home.Frank took the shears from his pocket and scratched into a few plastic windows, in Arabic lettering, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.He walked on, whistling through his teeth.Corner cafs were little caves of light.Bottles clinked like prospectors hammers.An Arab sat on a squat black speaker, playing an electric guitar.He found the central boulevard, walked up it.Boys in the branches of the lindens and sycamores shouted songs to each other in Schwyzerdtsch.One ditty was in English: John Boone/Went to the moon/No fast cars/He went to Mars!Small disorganized music bands barged through the thickening crowd.Some moustached men dressed as American cheerleaders flounced expertly through a complicated can can routine.Kids banged little plastic drums.It was loud; the tenting absorbed sound, so there werent the echoes one heard under crater domes, but it was loud nevertheless.Up there, where the boulevard opened into the sycamore park that was John himself, surrounded by a small crowd.He saw Chalmers approaching and waved, recognizing him despite the mask.That was how the first hundred knew each other ...Hey, Frank, he said.You look like youre having a good time.I am, Frank said through his mask.I love cities like this, dont you?A mixed species flock.It shows you what a diverse collection of cultures Mars is.Johns smile was easy.His eyes shifted as he surveyed the boulevard below.Sharply Frank said, A place like this is a crimp in your plan, isnt it?Boones gaze returned to him.The surrounding crowd slipped away, sensing the agonistic nature of the exchange.Boone said to Frank, I dont have a plan.Oh come on!What about your speech?Boone shrugged.Maya wrote it.A double lie: that Maya wrote it, that John didnt believe it.Probably.Even after all these years it was almost like talking to a stranger.To a politician at work.Come on, John, Frank snapped.You believe all that and you know it.But what are you going to do with all these different nationalities?All the ethnic hatreds, the religious manias?Your coalition cant possibly keep a thumb on all this.You cant keep Mars for yourselves, John, its not a scientific station anymore, and youre not going to get a treaty that makes it one.Were not trying to.Then why are you trying to cut me out of the talks!Im not!John looked injured.Relax, Frank.Well hammer it out together just like we always have.Relax.Frank stared at his old friend, nonplussed.What to believe?He had never known how to think of John the way he had used Frank as a springboard, the way he was so friendly ...hadnt they begun as allies, as friends?It occurred to him that John was looking for Maya.So where is she?Around somewhere, Boone said shortly.It had been years since they had been able to talk about Maya.Now Boone gave him a sharp look, as if to say it was none of his business.As if everything of importance to Boone had become, over the years, none of Franks business.Frank left him without a word.The sky was now a deep violet, streaked by yellow cirrus clouds.Frank passed two figures wearing white ceramic dominoes, the old Comedy and Tragedy personas, handcuffed together.The citys streets had gone dark and windows blazed, silhouettes partying in them.Big eyes darted in every blurry mask, looking to find the source of the tension in the air.Under the tidal sloshing of the crowd there was a low tearing sound.He shouldnt have been surprised, he shouldnt.He knew John as well as one could know another person; but it had never been any of his business.Into the trees of the park, under the hand sized leaves of the sycamores.When had it been any different!All that time together, those years of friendship; and none of it had mattered.Diplomacy by other means.He looked at his watch.Nearly eleven.He had an appointment with Selim.Another appointment.A lifetime of days divided into quarter hours made him used to running from one appointment to the next, changing masks, dealing with crisis after crisis, managing, manipulating, doing business in a hectic rush that never ended; and here it was a celebration, Mardi Gras, Fassnacht!and he was still doing it.He couldnt remember any other way.He came on a construction site, skeletal magnesium framing surrounded by piles of bricks and sand and paving stones.Careless of them to leave such things around.He stuffed his coat pockets with fragments of brick just big enough to hold.Straightening up, he noticed someone watching him from the other side of the site a little man with a thin face under spiky black dreadlocks, watching him intently.Something in the look was disconcerting, it was as if the stranger saw through all his masks and was observing him so closely because he was aware of his thoughts, his plans.Spooked, Chalmers beat a quick retreat into the bottom fringe of the park.When he was sure he had lost the man, and that no one else was watching, he began throwing stones and bricks down into the lower town, hurling them as hard as he could.And one for that stranger too, right in the face!Overhead the tent framework was visible only as a faint pattern of occluded stars; it seemed they stood free, in a chill night wind.Air circulation was high tonight, of course.Broken glass, shouts.A scream.It really was loud, people were going crazy.One last paving stone, heaved at a big lit picture window across the grass.It missed.He slipped further into the trees.Near the southern wall he saw someone under a sycamore Selim, circling nervously.Selim, Frank called quietly, sweating.He reached into his jumper pocket, carefully felt in the bag and palmed the trio of stem patches.Synergy could be so powerful, for good or ill.He walked forward and roughly embraced the young Arab.The patches hit and penetrated Selims light cotton shirt.Frank pulled back.Now Selim had about six hours.Did you speak with Boone?he asked.I tried, Chalmers said.He didnt listen.He lied to me.It was so easy to feign distress: Twenty five years of friendship, and he lied to me!He struck a tree trunk with his palm, and the patches flew away in the dark.He controlled himself.His coalition is going to recommend that all Martian settlements originate in the countries that signed the first treaty.It was possible; and it was certainly plausible.He hates us!Selim cried.He hates everything that gets in his way.And he can see that Islam is still a real force in peoples lives.It shapes the way people think, and he cant stand that.Selim shuddered.In the gloom the whites of his eyes were bright.He has to be stopped.Frank turned aside, leaned against a tree.I ...dont know.You said it yourself.Talk means nothing.Frank circled the tree, feeling dizzy.You fool, he thought, talk means everything.We are nothing but information exchange, talk is all we have!He came on Selim again and said, How?The planet.It is our way.The city gates are locked tonight.That stopped him.His hands started to twist.Frank said, But the gate to the farm is still open.But the farms outer gates will be locked.Frank shrugged, let him figure it out.And quickly enough Selim blinked, and said Ah.Then he was gone.Frank sat between trees, on the ground.It was a sandy damp brown dirt, product of a great deal of engineering.Nothing in the city was natural, nothing.After a time he got to his feet.He walked through the park, looking at people.If I find one good city I will spare the man.But in an open area masked figures darted together to grapple and fight, surrounded by watchers who smelled blood.Frank went back to the construction site to get more bricks.He threw them and some people saw him, and he had to run.Into the trees again, into the little tented wilderness, escaping predators while high on adrenaline, the greatest drug of all.He laughed wildly.Suddenly he caught sight of Maya, standing alone by the temporary platform up at the apex.She wore a white domino, but it was certainly her: the proportions of the figure, the hair, the stance itself, all unmistakable Maya Toitovna.The first hundred, the little band; they were the only ones truly alive to him anymore, the rest were ghosts.Frank hurried toward her, tripping over uneven ground.He squeezed a rock buried deep in one coat pocket, thinking Come on, you bitch.Say something to save him.Say something that will make me run the length of the city to save him!She heard his approach and turned.She wore a phosphorescent white domino with metallic blue sequins.It was hard to see her eyes.Hello, Frank, she said, as if he wore no mask.He almost turned and ran.Mere recognition was almost enough to do it.But he stayed.He said, Hello, Maya.Nice sunset, wasnt it?Spectacular.Nature has no taste.Its just a city inauguration, but it looked like Judgment Day.Yes.They were under a streetlight, standing on their shadows.She said, Have you enjoyed yourself?Very much.And you?Its getting a little wild.Its understandable, dont you think?Were out of our holes, Maya, were on the surface at last!And what a surface!You only get these kind of long views on Tharsis.Its a good location, she agreed.It will be a great city, Frank predicted.But where do you live these days, Maya?In Underhill, Frank, just as always.You know that.But youre never there, are you?I havent seen you in a year or more.Has it been that long?Well, Ive been in Hellas.Surely you heard?Who would tell me?She shook her head and blue sequins glittered.Frank.She turned aside, as if to walk away from the questions implications.Angrily Frank circled her, stood in her path.That time on the Ares, he said.His voice was tight, and he twisted his neck to loosen his throat, to make speech easier.What happened, Maya?What happened?She shrugged and did not meet his gaze.For a long time she did not speak.Then she looked at him.The spur of the moment, she said.And then it was ringing midnight, and they were in the Martian time slip, the thirty nine and a half minute gap between 12:00:00 and 12:00:01, when all the clocks went blank or stopped moving.This was how the first hundred had decided to reconcile Marss slightly longer day with the twenty four hour clock, and the solution had proved oddly satisfactory.Every night to step for a while out of the flicking numbers, out of the remorseless sweep of the second hand ...And tonight as the bells rang midnight, the whole city went mad.Almost forty minutes outside of time; it was bound to be the peak of the celebration, everyone knew that instinctively.Fireworks were going off, people were cheering; sirens tore through the sound, and the cheering redoubled.Frank and Maya watched the fireworks, listened to the noise.Then there was a noise that was somehow different: desperate cries, serious screams.Whats that?Maya said.A fight, Frank replied, cocking an ear.Something done on the spur of the moment, perhaps.She stared at him, and quickly he added, Maybe we should go have a look.The cries intensified.Trouble somewhere.They started down through the park, their steps getting longer, until they were in the Martian lope.The park seemed bigger to Frank, and for a moment he was scared.The central boulevard was covered with trash.People darted through the dark in predatory schools.A nerve grating siren went off, the alarm that signaled a break in the tent.Windows were shattering up and down the boulevard.There on the streetgrass was a man flat on his back, the surrounding grass smeared with black streaks.Chalmers seized the arm of a woman crouched over him.What happened?he shouted.She was weeping.They fought!They are fighting!Who?Swiss, Arab?Strangers, she said.Auslnder.She looked blindly at Frank.Get help!Frank rejoined Maya, who was talking to a group next to another fallen figure.What the hells going on?he said to her as they took off toward the citys hospital.Its a riot, she said.I dont know why.Her mouth was a straight slash, in skin as white as the domino still covering her eyes.Frank pulled off his mask and threw it away.There was broken glass all over the street.A man rushed at them.Frank!Maya!It was Sax Russell; Frank had never seen the little man so agitated.Its John hes been attacked!What?they exclaimed together.He tried to stop a fight, and three or four men jumped him.They knocked him down and dragged him away!You didnt stop them?Maya cried.We tried a whole bunch of us chased them.But they lost us in the medina.Maya looked at Frank.Whats going on!he cried.Where would anyone take him?The gates, she said.But theyre locked tonight, arent they?Maybe not to everyone.They followed her to the medina.Streetlights were broken, there was glass underfoot.They found a fire marshal and went to the Turkish Gate; he unlocked it and several of them hurried through, throwing on walkers at emergency speed.Then out into the night to look around, illuminated by the bathysphere glow of the city.Franks ankles hurt with the night cold, and he could feel the precise configuration of his lungs, as if two globes of ice had been inserted in his chest to cool the rapid beat of his heart.Nothing out there.Back inside.Over to the northern wall and the Syrian Gate, and out again under the stars.Nothing.It took them a long time to think of the farm.By then there were about thirty of them in walkers, and they ran down and through the lock and flooded down the farms aisles, spreading out, running between crops.They found him among the radishes.His jacket was pulled over his face, in the standard emergency air pocket; he must have done it unconsciously, because when they rolled him carefully onto one side, they saw a lump behind his ear.Get him inside, Maya said, her voice a bitter croakHurry, get him inside.Four of them lifted him.Chalmers cradled Johns head, and his fingers were intertwined with Mayas.They trotted back up the shallow steps.Through the farm gate they stumbled, back into the city.One of the Swiss led them to the nearest medical center, already crowded with desperate people.They got John onto an empty bench.His unconscious expression was pinched, determined.Frank tore off his helmet and went to work pulling rank, bulling into the emergency rooms and shouting at the doctors and nurses.They ignored him until one doctor said, Shut up.Im coming.She went into the hallway and with a nurses help clipped John into a monitor, then checked him out with the abstracted, absent look doctors have while working: hands at neck and face and head and chest, stethoscope ...Maya explained what they knew.The doctor took down an oxygen unit from the wall, looking at the monitor.Her mouth was bunched into a displeased little knot.Maya sat at the end of the bench, face suddenly distraught.Her domino had long since disappeared.Frank crouched beside her.We can keep working on him, the doctor said, but Im afraid hes gone.Too long without oxygen, you know.Keep working on him, Maya said.They did, of course.Eventually other medical people arrived, and they carted him off to an emergency room.Frank, Maya, Sax, Samantha, and a number of locals sat outside in the hall.Doctors came and went; their faces had the blank look they took on in the presence of death.Protective masks.One came out and shook his head.Hes dead.Too long out there.Frank leaned his head back against the wall.When Reinhold Messner returned from the first solo climb of Everest, he was severely dehydrated, and utterly exhausted; he fell down most of the last part of the descent, and collapsed on the Rongbuk glacier, and he was crawling over it on hands and knees when the woman who was his entire support team reached him; and he looked up at her out of a delirium, and said, Where are all my friends?It was quiet.No sound but the low hum and whoosh that one never escaped on Mars.Maya put a hand on Franks shoulder, and he almost flinched; his throat clamped down to nothing, it really hurt.Im sorry, he managed to say.She shrugged the remark aside, frowned.She had somewhat the air of the medical people.Well, she said, you never liked him much anyway.True, he said, thinking it would be politic to seem honest with her at that moment.But then he shuddered and said bitterly, What do you know about what I like or dont like.He shrugged her hand aside, struggled to his feet.She didnt know; none of them knew.He started to go into the emergency room, changed his mind.Time enough for that at the funeral.He felt hollow; and suddenly it seemed to him that everything good had gone away.He left the medical center.Impossible not to feel sentimental at such moments.He walked through the strangely hushed darkness of the city, into the land of Nod.The streets glinted as if stars had fallen to the pavement.People stood in clumps, silent, stunned by the news.Frank Chalmers made his way through them, feeling their stares, moving without thought toward the platform at the top of town; and as he walked he said to himself, Now well see what I can do with this planet.Part 2    The Voyage Out      Since theyre going to go crazy anyway, why not just send insane people in the first place, and save them the trouble?said Michel Duval.He was only half joking; his position throughout had been that the criteria for selection constituted a mind boggling collection of double binds.His fellow psychiatrists stared at him.Can you suggest any specific changes?asked the chairman, Charles York.Perhaps we should all go to Antarctica with them, and observe them in this first period of time together.It would teach us a lot.But our presence would be inhibitory.I think just one of us will be enough.So they sent Michel Duval.He joined a hundred and fifty odd finalists at McMurdo Station.The initial meeting resembled any other international scientific conference, familiar to them all from their various disciplines.But there was a difference: this was the continuation of a selection process that had lasted for years, and would last another.And those selected would go to Mars.So they lived in Antarctica for over a year together, familiarizing themselves with the shelters and equipment that were already landing on Mars in robot vehicles; familiarizing themselves with a landscape that was almost as cold and harsh as Mars itself; familiarizing themselves with each other.They lived in a cluster of habitats located in Wright Valley, the largest of Antarcticas Dry Valleys.They ran a biosphere farm, and then they settled into the habitats through a dark austral winter, and studied secondary or tertiary professions, or ran through simulations of the various tasks they would be performing on the spaceship Ares, or later on the red planet itself; and always, always aware that they were being watched, evaluated, judged.They were by no means all astronauts or cosmonauts, although there were a dozen or so of each, with many more up north clamoring to be included.But the majority of the colonists would have to have their expertise in areas that would come into play after landfall: medical skills, computer skills, robotics, systems design, architecture, geology, biosphere design, genetic engineering, biology; also every sort of engineering, and construction expertise of several kinds.Those who had made it to Antarctica were an impressive group of experts in the relevant sciences and professions, and they spent a good bit of their time crosstraining to become impressive in secondary and tertiary fields as well.And all their activity took place under the constant pressure of observation, evaluation, judgment.It was necessarily a stressful procedure; that was part of the test.Michel Duval felt that this was a mistake, as it tended to ingrain reticence and distrust in the colonists, preventing the very compatibility that the selection committee was supposedly seeking.One of the many double binds, in fact.The candidates themselves were quiet about that aspect of things, and he didnt blame them; there wasnt any better strategy to take, that was a double bind for you: it insured silence.They could not afford to offend anyone, or complain too much; they could not risk withdrawing too far; they could not make enemies.So they went on being brilliant and accomplished enough to stand out, but normal enough to get along.They were old enough to have learned a great deal, but young enough to endure the physical rigors of the work.They were driven enough to excel, but relaxed enough to socialize.And they were crazy enough to want to leave Earth forever, but sane enough to disguise this fundamental madness, in fact defend it as pure rationality, scientific curiosity or something of the sort which seemed to be the only acceptable reason for wanting to go, and so naturally they claimed to be the most scientifically curious people in history!But of course there had to be more to it than that.They had to be alienated somehow, alienated and solitary enough not to care about leaving everyone they had known behind forever and yet still connected and social enough to get along with all their new acquaintances in Wright Valley, with every member of the tiny village that the colony would become.Oh, the double binds were endless!They were to be both extraordinary and extra ordinary, at one and the same time.An impossible task, and yet a task that was an obstacle to their hearts greatest desire; making it the very stuff of anxiety, fear, resentment, rage.Conquering all those stresses ...But that too was part of the test.Michel could not help but observe with great interest.Some failed, cracked in one way or another.An American thermal engineer became increasingly withdrawn, then destroyed several of their rovers and had to be forcibly restrained and removed.A Russian pair became lovers, and then had a falling out so violent that they couldnt stand the sight of each other, and both had to be dropped.This melodrama illustrated the dangers of romance going awry, and made the rest of them very cautious in this regard.Relationships still developed, and by the time they left Antarctica they had had three marriages, and these lucky six could consider themselves in some sense safe; but most of them were so focused on getting to Mars that they put these parts of their lives on hold, and if anything conducted discreet friendships, in some cases hidden from almost everyone, in other cases merely kept out of the view of the selection committees.And Michel knew he was seeing only the tip of the iceberg.He knew that critical things were happening in Antarctica, out of his sight.Relationships were having their beginnings; and sometimes the beginning of a relationship determines how the rest of it will go.In the brief hours of daylight, one of them might leave the camp and hike out to Lookout Point; and another follow; and what happened out there might leave its mark forever.But Michel would never know.And then they left Antarctica, and the team was chosen.There were fifty men and fifty women: thirty five Americans, thirty five Russians, and thirty miscellaneous international affiliates, fifteen invited by each of the two big partners.Keeping such perfect symmetries had been difficult, but the selection committee had persevered.The lucky ones flew to Cape Canaveral or Baikonur, to ascend to orbit.At this point they both knew each other very well and did not know each other at all.They were a team, Michel thought, with established friendships, and a number of group ceremonies, rituals, habits, and tendencies; and among those tendencies was an instinct to hide, to play a role and disguise their real selves.Perhaps this was simply the definition of village life, of social life.But it seemed to Michel that it was worse than that; no one ever before had had to compete so strenuously to join a village, and the resulting radical division between public life and private life was new, and strange.Ingrained in them now was a certain competitive undercurrent, a constant subtle feeling that they were each alone, and that in case of trouble they were liable to be abandoned by the rest, and yanked out of the group.The selection committee had thus created some of the very problems it had hoped to prevent.Some of them were aware of this; and naturally they took care to include among the colonists the most qualified psychiatrist they could think of.So they sent Michel Duval.At first it felt like a shove in the chest.Then they were pushed back in their chairs, and for a second the pressure was deeply familiar: one g, the gravity they would never live in again.The Ares had been orbiting Earth at 28,000 kilometers per hour.For several minutes they accelerated, the rockets push so powerful that their vision blurred as corneas flattened, and it took an effort to inhale.At 40,000 kilometers per hour the burn ended.They were free of the Earths pull, in orbit to nothing but the sun.The colonists sat in the delta V chairs blinking, their skin flushed, their hearts pounding.Maya Katarina Toitovna, the official leader of the Russian contingent, glanced around.People appeared stunned.When obsessives are given their object of desire, what do they feel?It was hard to say, really.In a sense their lives were ending; yet something else, some other life, had finally, finally begun....Filled with so many emotions at once, it was impossible not to be confused; it was an interference pattern, some feelings cancelled, others reinforced.Unbuckling from her chair Maya felt a grin contorting her face, and she saw on the faces around her the same helpless grin all but Sax Russell, who was as impassive as an owl, blinking as he looked over the readouts on the rooms computer screens.They floated weightlessly around the room.December 21st, 2026: they were moving faster than anyone in history.They were on their way.It was the beginning of a nine month voyage or of a voyage that would last the rest of their lives.They were on their own.Those responsible for piloting the Ares pulled themselves to the control consoles and gave the orders to fire lateral control rockets.The Ares began to spin, stabilizing at four rpm.The colonists sank to the floors, and stood in a pseudogravity of .38 g, very close to what they would feel on Mars.Many man years of tests had indicated that it would be a fairly healthy g to live in, and so much healthier than weightlessness that rotating the ship had been deemed worth the trouble.And, Maya thought, it felt great.There was enough pull to make balance relatively easy, but hardly any feeling of pressure, of drag.It was the perfect equivalent of their mood; they staggered down the halls to the big dining hall in Torus D, giddy and exhilarated, walking on air.In Torus Ds dining hall they mingled in a kind of cocktail party, celebrating the departure.Maya wandered about, sipping freely from a mug of champagne, feeling slightly unreal and extremely happy, a mix that reminded her of her wedding reception many years before.Hopefully this marriage would go better than that one had, she thought, because this one was going to last forever.The hall was loud with talk.Its a symmetry not so much sociological as mathematic.A kind of aesthetic balance.Were hoping to get it into the parts per billion range, but its not going to be easy.Maya turned down an offered refill, feeling giddy enough.Besides, this was work.She was co mayor of this village, so to speak, responsible for group dynamics, which were bound to get complex.Antarctic habits kicked in even at this moment of triumph, and she listened and watched like an anthropologist, or a spy.The shrinks have their reasons.Well end up fifty happy couples.And they already know the match ups.She watched them laugh.Smart, healthy, supremely well educated was this the rational society at last, the scientifically designed community that had been the dream of the Enlightenment?But there was Arkady, Nadia, Vlad, Ivana.She knew the Russian contingent too well to have many illusions on that score.They were just as likely to end up resembling an undergraduate dorm at a technical university, occupied by bizarre pranks and lurid affairs.Except they looked a bit old for that kind of thing; several men were balding, and many of both sexes showed touches of gray in their hair.It had been a long haul; their average age was forty six, with extremes ranging from thirty three (Hiroko Ai, the Japanese prodigy of biosphere design) to fifty eight (Vlad Taneev, winner of a Nobel Prize in medicine).Now, however, the flush of youth was on all their faces.Arkady Bogdanov was a portrait in red: hair, beard, skin.In all that red his eyes were a wild electric blue, bugging out happily as he exclaimed, Free at last!Free at last!All our children are free at last!The video cameras had been turned off, after Janet Blyleven had recorded a series of interviews for the TV stations back home; they were out of contact with Earth, in the dining hall anyway, and Arkady was singing, and the group around him toasted the song.Maya stopped to join this group.Free at last; it was hard to believe, they were actually on their way to Mars!Knots of people talking, many of them world class in their fields; Ivana had won part of a Nobel Prize in chemistry, Vlad was one of the most famous medical biologists in the world, Sax was in the pantheon of great contributors to subatomic theory, Hiroko was unmatched in enclosed biological life support systems design, and so on all around; a brilliant crowd!And Maya was one of their leaders.It was a bit daunting.Her engineering and cosmonautic skills were modest enough, it was her diplomatic ability that had gotten her aboard, presumably.Chosen to head the disparate, fractious Russian team, with the several commonwealth members well, that was okay.It was interesting work, and she was used to it.And her skills might very well turn out to be the most important ones aboard.They had to get along, after all.And that was a matter of guile, and cunning, and will.Willing other people to do your bidding!She looked at the crowd of glowing faces, and laughed.All aboard were good at their work, but some were gifted far beyond that.She had to identify those people, to seek them out, to cultivate them.Her ability to function as leader depended on it, for in the end, she thought, they would surely become a kind of loose scientific meritocracy.And in such a society as that, the extraordinarily talented constituted the real powers.When push came to shove, they would be the colonys true leaders they, or those who influenced them.She looked around and located her opposite number, Frank Chalmers.In Antarctica she had not gotten to know him very well.A tall, big, swarthy man.He was talkative enough, and incredibly energetic, but hard to read.She found him attractive.Did he see things as she did?She had never been able to tell.He was talking to a group across the length of the room, listening in that sharp inscrutable way of his, head tilted to the side, ready to pounce with a witty remark.She was going to have to find out more about him.More than that, she was going to have to get along with him.She crossed the room, stopped by his side, stood so their upper arms just barely touched.Leaned her head in toward his.A brief gesture at their comrades: This is going to be fun, dont you think?Chalmers glanced at her.If it goes well, he said.After the celebration and dinner, unable to sleep, Maya wandered through the Ares.All of them had spent time in space before, but never in anything like the Ares, which was enormous.There was a kind of penthouse at the front end of the ship, a single tank like a bowsprit, which rotated in the opposite direction the ship did, so that it held steady.Solar watch instruments, radio antennas, and all the other equipment that worked best without rotation were located in this tank, and at the very tip of it was a bulbous room of transparent plastic, a chamber quickly named the bubble dome, which provided the crew with a weightless, nonrotating view of the stars, and a partial view of the great ship behind it.Maya floated near the window wall of this bubble dome, looking back at the ship curiously.It had been constructed using space shuttle external fuel tanks; around the turn of the century NASA and Glavkosmos had begun attaching small booster rockets to the tanks and pushing them all the way into orbit.Scores of tanks had been launched this way, then tugged to work sites and put to use with them they had built two big space stations, an L5 station, a lunar orbit station, the first manned Mars vehicle, and scores of unmanned freighters sent to Mars.So by the time the two agencies agreed to build the Ares, the use of the tanks had become routinized, with standard coupling units, interiors, propulsion systems and so forth; and construction of the big ship had taken less than two years.It looked like something made from a childrens toy set, in which cylinders were attached at their ends to create more complex shapes in this case, eight hexagons of connected cylinders, which they called toruses, lined up and speared down the middle by a central hub shaft, made of a cluster of five lines of cylinders.The toruses were connected to the hub shaft by thin crawl spokes, and the resulting object looked somewhat like a piece of agricultural machinery, say the arm of a harvester combine, or a mobile sprinkler unit.Or like eight knobby doughnuts, Maya thought, toothpicked to a stick.Just the sort of thing a child would appreciate.The eight toruses had been made from American tanks, and the five bundled lengths of the central shaft were Russian.Both kinds of tanks were about fifty meters long and ten meters in diameter.Maya floated aimlessly down the tanks of the hub shaft; it took her a long time, but she was in no hurry.She dropped down into Torus G.  There were rooms of all shapes and sizes, right up to the largest, which occupied entire tanks.The floor in one of these she passed through was set just below the halfway mark, so its interior resembled a long Quonset hut.But the majority of the tanks had been divided up into smaller rooms.She had heard there were over five hundred of them in all, making for a total interior space roughly the equivalent of a large city hotel.But would it be enough?Perhaps it would.After the Antarctic, life on the Ares seemed an expansive, labyrinthine, airy experience.Around six every morning the darkness in the residential toruses would lighten slowly to a gray dawn, and around six thirty a sudden brightening marked sunrise.Maya woke to it as she had all her life.After visiting the lavatory she would make her way to Torus Ds kitchen, heat a meal, and take it into the big dining hall.There she sat at a table flanked by potted lime trees.Hummingbirds, finches, tanagers, sparrows and lories pecked underfoot and darted overhead, dodging the creeping vines that hung from the halls long barrel ceiling, which was painted a gray blue that reminded her of St.Petersburgs winter sky.She would eat slowly, watch the birds, relax in her chair, listen to the talk around her.A leisurely breakfast!After a lifetime of grinding work it felt rather uncomfortable at first, even alarming, like a stolen luxury.As if it were Sunday morning every day, as Nadia said.But Mayas Sunday mornings had never been particularly relaxed.In her childhood that had been the time for cleaning the one room apartment she had shared with her mother.Her mother had been a doctor and like most women of her generation had had to work ferociously to get by, obtaining food, bringing up a child, keeping an apartment, running a career; it had been too much for one person, and she had joined the many women angrily demanding a better deal than they had gotten in the Soviet years, which had given them half the money jobs while leaving them all the work at home.No more waiting, no more mute endurance; they had to take advantage while the instability lasted.Everything is on the table, Mayas mother would exclaim while cooking their meager dinners, everything but food!And perhaps they had taken advantage.In the Soviet era women had learned to help each other, a nearly self contained world had come into being, of mothers, sisters, daughters, babushkas, women friends, colleagues, even strangers.In the commonwealth this world had consolidated its gains and thrust even further into the power structure, into the tight male oligarchies of Russian government.One of the fields most affected had been the space program.Mayas mother, slightly involved in space medical research, always swore that cosmonautics would need an influx of women, if only to provide female data for the medical experimentation.They cant hold Valentina Tereshkova against us forever!her mother would cry.And apparently she had been right, because after studying aeronautic engineering at Moscow University, Maya had been accepted in a program at Baikonur, and had done well, and had gotten an assignment on Novy Mir.While up there she had redesigned the interiors for improved ergonomic efficiency, and later spent a year in command of the station, during which a couple of emergency repairs had bolstered her reputation.Administrative assignments in Baikonur and Moscow had followed, and over time she had managed to penetrate Glavkosmoss little politburo, playing the men against each other in the subtlest of ways, marrying one of them, divorcing him, rising afterward in Glavkosmos a free agent, becoming one of the utmost inner circle, the double triumvirate.And so here she was, having a leisurely breakfast.So civilized, Nadia would scoff.She was Mayas best friend on the Ares, a short woman round as a stone, with a square face framed by cropped salt and pepper hair.Plain as could be.Maya, who knew she was good looking, and knew that this had helped her many times, loved Nadias plainness, which somehow underlined her competence.Nadia was an engineer and very practical, an expert in cold climate construction.They had met in Baikonur twenty years before, and once lived together on Novy Mir for several months; over the years they had become like sisters, in that they were not much alike, and did not often get along, and yet were intimate.Now Nadia looked around and said, Putting the Russian and American living quarters in different toruses was a horrible idea.We work with them during the day, but we spend most of our time here with the same old faces.It only reinforces the other divisions between us.Maybe we should offer to exchange half the rooms.Arkady, wolfing down coffee rolls, leaned over from the next table.Its not enough, he said, as if he had been part of their conversation all along.His red beard, growing wilder every day, was dusted with crumbs.We should declare every other Sunday to be moving day, and have everyone shift quarters on a random basis.People would get to know more of the others, and there would be fewer cliques.And the notion of ownership of the rooms would be reduced.But I like owning a room, Nadia said.Arkady downed another roll, grinned at her as he chewed.It was a miracle he had passed the selection committee.But Maya brought up the subject with the Americans, and though no one liked Arkadys plan, a single exchange of half the apartments struck them as a good idea.After some consulting and discussion, the move was arranged.They did it on a Sunday morning, and after that, breakfast was a little more cosmopolitan.Mornings in the D dining hall now included Frank Chalmers and John Boone, and also Sax Russell, Mary Dunkel, Janet Blyleven, Rya Jimenez, Michel Duval, and Ursula Kohl.John Boone turned out to be an early riser, getting to the dining hall even before Maya.This room is so spacious and airy, it really has an outdoor feel to it, he said from his table one dawn when Maya came in.A lot better than Bs hall.The trick is to remove all chrome and white plastic, Maya replied.Her English was fairly good, and getting better fast.And then paint the ceiling like real sky.Not just straight blue, you mean?Yes.He was, she thought, a typical American: simple, open, straightforward, relaxed.And yet this particular specimen was one of the most famous people in history.It was an unavoidable, heavy fact, but Boone seemed to slip out from under it, to leave it around his feet on the floor.Intent on the taste of a roll, or some news on the table screen, he never referred to his previous expedition, and if someone brought the subject up he spoke as if it were no different from any of the flights the rest of them had taken.But it wasnt so, and only his ease made it seem that way: at the same table each morning, laughing at Nadias lame engineering jokes, making his portion of the talk.After a while it took an effort to see the aura around him.Frank Chalmers was more interesting.He always came in late, and sat by himself, paying attention only to his coffee and the table screen.After a couple of cups he would talk to people nearby, in ugly but functional Russian.Most of the breakfast conversations in D hall had now shifted to English, to accommodate the Americans.The linguistic situation was a set of nesting dolls: English held all hundred of them, inside that was Russian, and inside that the languages of the commonwealth, and then the internationals.Eight people aboard were idiolinguists, a sad kind of orphaning in Mayas opinion, and it seemed to her they were more Earth oriented than the rest, and in frequent communication with people back home.It was a little strange to have their psychiatrist in that category; though bilingual, he was very focused on France.Anyway English was the ships lingua franca, and at first Maya had thought that this gave the Americans an advantage.But then she noticed that when they spoke they were always on stage to everyone, while the rest of them had more private languages they could switch to if they wanted.Frank Chalmers was the exception to all that, however.He spoke five languages, more than anyone else aboard.And he did not fear to use his Russian, even though it was very bad; he just hacked out questions and then listened to the answers, with a really piercing intensity, and a quick startling laugh.He was an unusual American in many ways, Maya thought.At first he seemed to have all the characteristics, he was big, loud, maniacally energetic, confident, restless; talkative and friendly enough, after that first coffee.It took a while to notice how he turned the friendliness on and off, and to notice how little his talk revealed.Maya never learned a thing about his past, for instance, despite deliberate efforts to chat him up.It made her curious.He had black hair, a swarthy face, light hazel eyes handsome in a tough guy way his smile brief, his laugh sharp, like Mayas mothers.His gaze too was sharp, especially when looking at Maya; a matter of evaluating the other leader, she assumed.He acted toward her as if they had an understanding built on long acquaintance, a presumption which made her uneasy given how little they had spoken together in Antarctica.She was used to thinking of women as her allies, and of men as attractive but dangerous problems.So a man who presumed to be her ally was only the more problematic.And dangerous.And ...something else.She recalled only one moment when she had seen further into him than the skin, and that had been back in Antarctica.After the thermal engineer had cracked and been sent north, news of his replacement had come down, and when it was announced everyone was quite surprised and excited to hear that it was going to be John Boone himself, even though he had certainly received more than the maximum radiation dosage on his previous expedition.While the evening room was still buzzing with the news Maya had seen Chalmers come in and be told of it, and he had jerked his head around to stare at his informant; and then for a fraction of a second she had seen a flash of fury, a flash so fast it was almost a subliminal event.But it had made her attentive to him.And certainly he and John Boone had an odd relationship.It was difficult for Chalmers, of course; he was the Americans official leader, and even had the title Captain but Boone, with his blond good looks and the strange presence of his accomplishment, certainly had more natural authority he seemed the real American leader, and Frank Chalmers something like an overactive executive officer, doing Boones unspoken bidding.That could not be comfortable.They were old friends, Maya had been told when she asked.But she saw few signs of it herself, even watching closely.They seldom talked to each other in public, and did not seem to visit in private.Thus when they were together she watched them more closely than ever, without ever consciously considering why the natural logic of the situation just seemed to demand it.If they had been back at Glavkosmos, it would have made strategic sense to drive a wedge between them, but she didnt think of it that way here.There was a lot that Maya didnt think about consciously.She watched, though.And one morning Janet Blyleven wore her video glasses into D hall for breakfast.She was a principal reporter for American television, and often she wove her way through the ship wearing her vidglasses, looking around and talking the commentary, collecting stories and transmitting them back home where they would be, as Arkady put it, predigested and vomited back into that baby bird consensus.It was nothing new, of course.Media attention was a familiar part of every astronauts life, and during the selection process they had been scrutinized more than ever.Now, however, they were the raw material for programs magnitudes more popular than any space program had been before.Millions watched them as the ultimate soap opera, and this bothered some of them.So when Janet settled at the end of the table wearing those stylish spectacles with the optical fibers in the frame, there were a few groans.And at the other end of the table Ann Clayborne and Sax Russell were arguing, oblivious to any of them.Itll take years to find out what we have there, Sax.Decades.Theres as much land on Mars as on Earth, with a unique geology and chemistry.The land has to be thoroughly studied before we can start changing it.Veni, vidi, vici.Well change it just by landing.Russell brushed aside Anns objections as if they were spiderwebs on his face.Deciding to go to Mars is like the first phrase of a sentence, and the whole sentence says  Russell shrugged.If you want to put it that way.Youre the weenie, Sax, Ann said, lip curled with irritation.She was a broad shouldered woman with wild brown hair, a geologist with strong views, difficult in argument.Look, Mars is its own place.You can play your climate shifting games back on Earth if you want, they need the help.Or try it on Venus.But you cant just wipe out a three billion year old planetary surface.Russell rubbed away more spiderwebs.Its dead, he said simply.Besides, its not really our decision.Itll be taken out of our hands.None of these decisions will be taken out of our hands, Arkady put in sharply.Janet looked from speaker to speaker, taking it all in.Ann was getting agitated, raising her voice.Maya glanced around, and saw that Frank didnt like the situation.But if he interrupted it he would give away to the millions the fact that he didnt want the colonists arguing in front of them.Instead he looked across the table and caught Boones gaze.There was an exchange of expressions between the two so quick it made Maya blink.Boone said, When I was there before, I got the impression it was already Earthlike.Except two hundred degrees Kelvin, Russell said.Sure, but it looked like the Mojave, or the Dry Valleys.The first time I looked around on Mars I found myself keeping an eye out for one of those mummified seals we saw in the Dry Valleys.And so on.Janet turned to him, and Ann, looking disgusted, picked up her coffee and left.Afterward Maya concentrated, trying to recall the looks Boone and Chalmers had exchanged.They had been like something from a code, or the private languages invented by identical twins.The weeks passed, and the days each began with a leisurely breakfast.Mid mornings were far busier.Everyone had a schedule, although some were fuller than others.Franks was packed, which was the way he liked it, a maniacal blur of activity.But the necessary work was not really all that great: they had to keep themselves alive and in shape, and keep the ship running, and keep preparing for Mars.Ship maintenance ranged from the intricacy of programming or repairs to the simplicity of moving supplies out of storage, or taking trash to the recyclers.The biosphere team spent the bulk of its time on the farm, which occupied large parts of toruses C, E, and F; and everyone aboard had farm chores.Most enjoyed this work, and some even returned in their free hours.Everyone was on doctors orders to spend three hours a day on treadmills, escalators, running wheels, or using weight machines.These hours were enjoyed or endured or despised, depending on temperament, but even those who claimed to despise them finished their exercises in noticeably (even measurably) better moods.Beta endorphins are the best drug, Michel Duval would say.Which is lucky, since we dont have any others, John Boone would reply.Oh, theres caffeine ...Puts me to sleep.Alcohol ...Gives me a headache.Procaine, Darvon, morphine  Morphine?In the medical supplies.Not for general use.Arkady smiled.Maybe Id better get sick.The engineers, including Maya, spent many mornings in training simulations.These took place on the backup bridge in Torus B, which had the latest in image synthesizers; the simulations were so sophisticated that there was little visible difference between them and the act itself.This did not necessarily make them interesting: the standard orbital insertion approach, simulated weekly, was dubbed The Mantra Run, and became quite a bore to every conceivable flight crew.But sometimes even boredom was preferable to the alternatives.Arkady was their training specialist, and he had a perverse talent for designing problem runs so hard that they often killed everybody.These runs were strangely unpleasant experiences, and did not make Arkady popular among his victims.He mixed problem runs with Mantra Runs randomly, but more and more often they were problem runs; they would approach Mars and red lights would flash, sometimes with sirens, and they were in trouble again.Once they struck a planetesimal weighing approximately fifteen grams, leaving a large flaw in the heat shield.Sax Russell had calculated that their chances of hitting anything larger than a gram were about one in every seven thousand years of travel, but nevertheless there they were, emergency!, adrenaline pouring through them even as they pooh poohed the very idea of it, rushing up to the hub and into EVA suits, going out to fill the pothole before they hit the Martian atmosphere and burned to a crisp; and halfway there, Arkadys voice came over their intercoms: Not fast enough!All of us are dead.But that was a simple one.Others....The ship, for instance, was guided by a fly by wire system, meaning that the pilots fed instructions to flight computers which translated them into the actual thrusts needed to achieve the desired result.This was how it had to be, because when approaching a gravitational mass like Mars at their speed, one simply could not feel or intuit what burns would achieve the desired effects.So none of them were flyers in the sense of a pilot flying a plane.Nevertheless, Arkady frequently blew the entire massively redundant system just as they were reaching a critical moment (which failure, Russell said, had about a one in ten billion chance of happening) and they had to take over and command all the rockets mechanically, watching the monitors and an orange on black visual image of Mars bearing down on them, and they could either go long and skip off into deep space and die a lingering death, or go short and crash into the planet and die instantly, and if the latter, they got to watch it right down to the simulated 120 kilometer per second final smash.Or it might be a mechanical failure: main rockets, stabilizing rockets, computer hardware or software, heatshield deployment; all of them had to work perfectly during the approach.And failures of these systems were the most likely of all in the range, Sax said (though others contested his risk assessment methods), of one in every ten thousand approaches.So they would do it again and red lights would flash, and they would groan, and beg for a Mantra Run even as they partly welcomed the new challenge.When they managed to survive a mechanical failure, they were tremendously pleased; it could be the high point of a week.Once John Boone successfully aerobraked by hand, with a single main rocket functioning, hitting the safe millisecond of arc at the only possible speed.No one could believe it.Blind luck, Boone said, grinning widely as the deed was talked about at dinner.Most of Arkadys problem runs ended in failure, however, meaning death for all.Simulated or not, it was hard not to be sobered by these experiences, and after that, irritated with Arkady for inventing them.One time they repaired every monitor in the bridge just in time to see the screens register a hit by a small asteroid, which sheared through the hub and killed them all.Another time Arkady, as part of the navigation team, made an error and instructed the computers to increase the ships spin rather than decrease it.Pinned to the floor by six gs!he cried in mock horror, and they had to crawl on the floor for half an hour, pretending to rectify the error while weighing half a ton each.When they succeeded, Arkady leaped off the floor and began pushing them away from the control monitor.What the hell are you doing?Maya yelled.Hes gone crazy, Janet said.Hes simulated going crazy, Nadia corrected her.We have to figure out doing an end run around Arkady  how to deal with someone on the bridge going insane!Which no doubt was true.But they could see the whites of Arkadys eyes all the way around, and there wasnt a trace of recognition in him as he silently assaulted them.It took all five of them to restrain him, and Janet and Phyllis Boyle were hurt by his sharp elbows.Well?he said at dinner afterward, grinning lopsidedly, as he was growing a fat lip.What if it happens?Were under pressure up here, and the approach will be worst of all.What if someone cracks?He turned to Russell and the grin grew wider.What are the chances of that, eh?And he began to sing a Jamaican song, in a Slavic Caribbean accent: Pressure drop, oh pressure drop, oh o, pressure going to drop on you oo oo!So they kept trying, handling the problem runs as seriously as they could, even the attack by Martian natives or the decoupling of Torus H caused by explosive bolts installed by mistake when the ship was built, or the last minute veering of Phobos out of its orbit.Dealing with the more implausible scenarios sometimes took on a kind of surreal black humor, and Arkady replayed some of his videotapes as after dinner entertainment, which sometimes got people launched into the air with laughter.But the plausible problem runs ...They kept on coming, morning after morning.And despite the solutions, despite the protocols for finding solutions, there was that sight, time after time the red planet rushing at them at an unimaginable 40,000 kilometers an hour, until it filled the screen and the screen went white, and small black letters appeared on it: Collision.They were traveling to Mars in a Type II Hohmann Ellipse, a slow but efficient course, chosen from among other alternatives mainly because the two planets were in the correct position for it when the ship was finally ready, with Mars about forty five degrees ahead of Earth in the plane of the ecliptic.During the voyage they would travel just over halfway around the sun, making their rendezvous with Mars some three hundred days later.Their womb time, as Hiroko called it.The psychologists back home had judged it worthwhile to alter things from time to time, to suggest the passing of the seasons on the Ares.Length of days and nights, weather, and ambient colors were shifted to accomplish this.Some had maintained their landfall should be a harvest, others that it should be a new spring; after a short debate it had been decided by vote of the voyagers themselves to begin with early spring, so that they would travel through a summer rather than a winter; and as they approached their goal, the ships colors would turn to the autumn tones of Mars itself, rather than to the light greens and blossom pastels they had left so far behind.So in those first months, as they finished their mornings business, leaving the farm or the bridge, or staggering out of Arkadys merrily sadistic simulations, they walked into springtime.Walls were hung with pale green panels, or mural sized photos of azaleas, and jacarandas, and ornamental cherries.The barley and mustard in the big farm rooms glowed vivid yellow with new blooms, and the forest biome and the ships seven park rooms had been stocked with trees and shrubs in the spring of their cycles.Maya loved these colorful spring blossoms, and after her mornings work she fulfilled part of her exercise regimen by taking a walk in the forest biome, which had a hilly floor, and was so thick with trees one could not see from one end of the chamber to the other.Here she often met Frank Chalmers, of all people, taking one of his short breaks.He said he liked the spring foliage, though he never seemed to look at it.They walked together, and talked or not as the case might be.If they did talk, it was never about anything important; Frank didnt care to discuss their work as leaders of the expedition.Maya found this peculiar, though she didnt say so.But they did not have exactly the same jobs, which might account for his reluctance.Mayas position was fairly informal and nonhierarchical cosmonauts among themselves had always been relatively egalitarian, this had been the tradition since the days of Korolyov.The American program had a more military tradition, indicated even in titles: while Maya was merely Russian Contingent Coordinator, Frank was Captain Chalmers, and supposedly in the strong sense of the old sailing navies.Whether this authority made it more or less difficult for him, he didnt say.Sometimes he discussed the biome, or small technical problems, or news from home; more often he just seemed to want to walk with her.So silent walks, up and down on narrow trails, through dense thickets of pine and aspen and birch.And always that presumption of closeness, as if they were old friends, or as if he were, very shyly (or subtly), courting her.Thinking about that one day, it occurred to Maya that starting the Ares in springtime might have created a problem.Here they were in their mesocosm, sailing through spring, and everything was fertile and blooming, profligate and green, the air perfumed with flowers and windy, the days getting longer and warmer, and everyone in shirts and shorts, a hundred healthy animals, in close quarters, eating, exercising, showering, sleeping.Of course there had to be sex.Well, it was nothing new.Maya herself had had some fantastic sex in space, most significantly during her second stint on Novy Mir, when she and Georgi and Yeli and Irina had tried every weightless variant imaginable, which was a great many indeed.But now it was different.They were older, they were stuck with each other for good: Everything is different in a closed system, as Hiroko often said in other contexts.The idea that they should stay on a fraternal basis was big at NASA: out of the 1,348 pages of the tome NASA had compiled called Human Relations in Transit to Mars, only a single page was devoted to the subject of sex; and that page advised against it.They were, the tome suggested, something like a tribe, with a sensible taboo against intratribal mating.The Russians laughed hilariously at this.Americans were such prudes, really.We are not a tribe, Arkady said.We are the world.And it was spring.And there were the married couples aboard, some of whom were pretty demonstrative; and there was the swimming pool in Torus E, and the sauna and whirlpool bath.Bathing suits were used in mixed company, this because of the Americans again, but bathing suits were nothing.Naturally it began to happen.She heard from Nadia and Ivana that the bubble dome was being used for assignations in the quiet hours of the night; many of the cosmonauts and astronauts turned out to be fond of weightlessness.And the many nooks in the parks and the forest biome were serving as hideaways for those with less weightless experience; the parks had been designed to give people the sense that they could get away.And every person had a private soundproofed room of their own.With all that, if a couple wanted to begin a relationship without becoming an item in the gossip mill, it was possible to be very discreet.Maya was sure there was more going on than any one person could know.D0#0;000;^She could feel it.No doubt others did as well.Quiet conversations between couples, changes in dining room partners, quick glances, small smiles, hands touching shoulders or elbows in passing oh yes, things were happening.It made for a kind of tension in the air, a tension that was only partly pleasant.Antarctic fears came back into play; and besides, there was only a small number of potential partners, which tended to give things a musical chairs kind of feeling.And for Maya there were additional problems.She was even more wary than usual of Russian men, because in this case it would mean sleeping with the boss.She was suspicious of that, knowing how it had felt when she had done it herself.Besides, none of them ...well, she was attracted to Arkady, but she did not like him, and he seemed uninterested.Yeli she knew from before, he was just a friend; Dmitri she didnt care for; Vlad was older, Yuri not her type, Alex a follower of Arkadys ...on and on like that.And as for the Americans, or the internationals well, that was a different kind of problem.Cross cultures, who knew?So she kept to herself.But she thought about it.And occasionally, while waking up in the morning, or finishing a workout, she floated on a wave of desire that left her washed up on the shore of bed or shower, feeling alone.Thus late one morning, after a particularly harrowing problem run, which they had almost solved and then failed to solve, she ran into Frank Chalmers in the forest biome and returned his hello, and they walked for about ten meters into the woods and stopped.She was in shorts and tank top, barefoot, sweaty and flushed from the crazed simulation.He was in shorts and a T shirt, barefoot, sweaty and dusty from the farm.Suddenly he laughed his sharp laugh, and reached out to touch her upper arm with two fingertips.Youre looking happy today.With that darting smile.The leaders of the two halves of the expedition.Equals.She lifted her hand to touch his, and that was all it took.They left the trail and ducked into a tight thicket of pine.They stopped to kiss, and it had been long enough since the last time that it felt strange to her.Tripping over a root Frank laughed under his breath, that quick secretive laugh which gave Maya a shiver, almost of fear.They sat on pine needles, rolled together like students necking in the woods.She laughed; she had always liked the quick approach, the way she could just knock a man down when she wanted to.And so they made love, and for a time passion took her away.When it was over she relaxed, enjoying the wash of afterglow.But then it got a bit awkward, somehow; she didnt know what to say.There was something hidden still about him, as if he were hiding even when making love.And even worse, what she could sense behind his reserve was some kind of triumph, as if he had won something and she had lost.That Puritan streak in Americans, that sense that sex was wrong and something that men had to trick women into.She closed up a little herself, annoyed at that hidden smirk on his face.Win and lose, what children.And yet they were co mayors, so to speak.So if it were put on a zero sum basis ...They talked for a while in a jovial enough way, and even made love again before they left.But it wasnt quite the same as the first time, she found herself distracted.So much in sex was beyond rational analysis.Maya always felt things about her partners that she could not analyze or even express; but she always either liked what she felt or didnt, there was no doubt about that.And looking at Frank Chalmerss face after the first time, she had been sure that something wasnt right.It made her uneasy.But she was amiable, affectionate.It would not do to be put off at such a moment, no one would forgive that.They got up and dressed and went back into Torus D, and ate dinner at the same table with some others, and that was when it made perfect sense to become more distant.But then in the days after their encounter, she was surprised and displeased to find herself putting him off a little bit, making excuses to avoid being alone with him.It was awkward, not what she had wanted at all.She would have preferred not to feel the way she did, and once or twice after that they went off alone again, and when he started things she made love with him again, wanting it to work, feeling that she must have made a mistake or been in a bad mood somehow.But it was always the same, there was always that little smirk of triumph, that I got you that she disliked so much, that moralistic Puritan double standard dirtiness.And so she avoided him even more, to keep from getting into the start situation; and quickly enough he caught the drift.One afternoon he asked her to go for a walk in the biome, and when she declined, claiming fatigue, a staccato look of surprise passed over his face, and then it had closed up like a mask.She felt badly, because she couldnt even explain it to herself.To try to make up for such an unreasonable withdrawal, she was friendly and forthright with him after that, as long as it was a safe situation.And once or twice she suggested, indirectly, that for her their encounters had been only a matter of sealing a friendship, something she had done with others as well.All this had to be conveyed between words, however, and it was possible he misunderstood.After that first jolt of comprehension, he only seemed puzzled.Once, when she left a group just before it broke up, she had seen him give her a sharp glance.After that, only distance and reserve.But he had never been really upset, and he never pressed the issue, or came to her to talk about it.But that was part of the problem, wasnt it?He didnt seem to want to talk to her about that kind of thing.Well, perhaps he had affairs going with other women, with some of the Americans, it was hard to say.He really did keep to himself.But it was ...awkward.Maya resolved to abolish the knockover seduction, no matter the thrill she got from it.Hiroko was right; everything was different in a closed system.It was too bad for Frank (if he did care), because he had served as her education in this regard.In the end she resolved to make it up to him, by being a good friend.She worked so hard at doing this that once, almost a month later, she miscalculated and went a little too far, to the point where he thought she was seducing him again.They had been part of a group, up late talking, and she had sat next to him, and afterward he had clearly gotten the wrong impression, and walked with her around Torus D to the bathrooms, talking in the charming and affable way he had at this stage of things.Maya was vexed with herself; she didnt want to seem completely fickle, although at this point either way she went it would probably look that way.So she went along with him, just because it was easier, and because there was a part of her that wanted to make love.And so she did, upset with herself and resolved that this should be the last time, a sort of final gift that would hopefully make the whole incident a good memory for him.She found herself becoming more passionate than ever before, she really wanted to please him.And then, just before orgasm, she looked up at his face, and it was like looking in the windows of an empty house.That was the last time.v for velocity, delta for change.In space, this is the measure of the change in velocity required to get from one place to another thus, a measure of the energy required to do it.Everything is moving already.But to get something from the (moving) surface of the Earth into orbit around it, requires a minimum v of ten kilometers per second; to leave Earths orbit and fly to Mars requires a minimum v of 3.6 kilometers per second; and to orbit Mars and land on it requires a v of about one kilometer per second.The hardest part is leaving Earth behind, for that is by far the deepest gravity well involved.Climbing up that steep curve of spacetime takes tremendous force, shifting the direction of an enormous inertia.History too has an inertia.In the four dimensions of spacetime, particles (or events) have directionality; mathematicians, trying to show this, draw what they call world lines on graphs.In human affairs, individual world lines form a thick tangle, curling out of the darkness of prehistory and stretching through time: a cable the size of Earth itself, spiraling round the sun on a long curved course.That cable of tangled world lines is history.Seeing where it has been, it is clear where it is going it is a matter of simple extrapolation.For what kind of v would it take to escape history, to escape an inertia that powerful, and carve a new course?The hardest part is leaving Earth behind.The form of the Ares gave a structure to reality; the vacuum between Earth and Mars began to seem to Maya like a long series of cylinders, bent up at their joints at forty five degree angles.There was a runners course, a kind of steeplechase, around Torus C, and at each joint she slowed down in her run and tensed her legs for the increased pressure of the two 22.5 degree bends, and suddenly she could see up the length of the next cylinder.It was beginning to seem a rather narrow world.Perhaps in compensation, the people inside began to get somehow larger.The process of shedding their Antarctic masks continued, and every time someone displayed some new and hitherto unknown characteristic, it made all who noticed it feel that much freer; and this feeling caused more hidden traits to be revealed.One Sunday morning the Christians aboard, numbering a dozen or so, celebrated Easter in the bubble dome.It was April back home, though the Ares season was midsummer.After their service they came down to the D dining hall for brunch among them Yuri, Rya, Edvard and Mary.Maya, Frank, John, Arkady, and Sax were at a table, drinking cups of coffee and tea.The conversations among them and with other tables were densely interwoven, and at first only Maya and Frank heard what John was saying to Phyllis Boyle, the geologist who had conducted the Easter service.I understand the idea of the universe as a superbeing, and all its energy being the thoughts of this being.Its a nice concept.But the Christ story ...John shook his head.Do you really know the story?Phyllis asked.I was brought up Lutheran in Minnesota, John replied shortly.I went to confirmation class, had the whole thing drilled into me.Which, Maya thought, was probably why he bothered to get into discussions like this.He had a displeased expression that Maya had never seen before, and she leaned forward a bit, suddenly concentrating.She glanced at Frank; he was gazing into his coffee cup as if in a reverie, but she was sure he was listening.John said, You must know that the gospels were written decades after the event, by people who never met Christ.And that there are other gospels which reveal a different Christ, gospels that were excluded from the Bible by a political process in the third century.So hes a kind of literary figure really, a political construct.We dont know anything about the man himself.Phyllis shook her head.Thats not true.But it is, John objected.This caused Sax and Arkady to look up from the next table.Look, theres a history to all this stuff.Monotheism is a belief system that you see appearing in early herding societies.The greater their dependence on sheep herding, the more likely their belief in a shepherd god.Its an exact correlation, you can chart it and see.And the god is always male, because those societies were patriarchal.Theres a kind of archeology, an anthropology a sociology of religion, that makes all of this perfectly clear how it came about, what needs it fulfilled.Phyllis regarded him with a small smile.I dont know what to say to that, John.Its not a matter of history, after all.Its a matter of faith.Do you believe in Christs miracles?The miracles arent what matter.Its not the church or its dogma that matters.Its Jesus himself that matters.But hes just a literary construct, John repeated doggedly.Something like Sherlock Holmes, or the Lone Ranger.And you didnt answer my question about the miracles.Phyllis shrugged.I consider the presence of the universe to be a miracle.The universe and everything in it.Can you deny it?Sure, John said.The universe just is.I define a miracle as an action that clearly breaks known physical law.Like traveling to other planets?No.Like raising the dead.Doctors do that every day.Doctors have never done that.Phyllis looked nonplussed.I dont know what to say to you, John.Im kind of surprised.We dont know everything, to pretend we do is arrogance.The creation is mysterious.To give something a name like the big bang, and then think you have an explanation its bad logic, bad thinking.Outside your rational scientific thought is an enormous area of consciousness, an area more important than science.Faith in God is part of that.And I suppose you either have it or you dont.She stood.I hope it comes to you.She left the room.After a silence, John sighed.Sorry, folks.Sometimes it still gets to me.Whenever scientists say theyre Christian, Sax said, I take it to be an aesthetic statement.The church of the wouldnt it be pretty to think so, Frank said, still looking into his cup.Sax said, They feel were missing a spiritual dimension of life that earlier generations had, and they attempt to regain it using the same means.He blinked in his owlish way, as if the problem were disposed of by being defined.But that brings in so many absurdities!John exclaimed.You just dont have faith, Frank said, egging him on.John ignored him.People who in the lab are as hard headed as can be you should see Phyllis grilling the conclusions her colleagues draw from their data!And then suddenly they start using all kinds of debaters tricks, evasions, qualifications, fuzzy thinking of every kind.As if they were an entirely different person.You just dont have faith!Frank repeated.Well I hope I never get it!Its like being hit by a hammer in the head!John stood and took his tray to the kitchen.The rest looked at each other in silence.It must have been, Maya thought, a really bad confirmation class.Clearly none of the others had known any more than her about this side of their easygoing hero.Who knew what they would learn next, about him or any of them?News of the argument between John and Phyllis spread through the crew.Maya wasnt sure who was telling the story neither John nor Phyllis seemed inclined to speak of it.Then she saw Frank with Hiroko, laughing as he told her something.Walking by them she heard Hiroko say, Youve got to admit Phyllis is right about that part we dont understand the why of things at all.Frank, then.Sowing discord between Phyllis and John.And (not a trivial point) Christianity was still a major force in America, and elsewhere.If word got around back home that John Boone was anti Christian, it could give him problems.And that wouldnt be such a bad thing for Frank.They were all getting media play on Earth, but if you watched some of the news and features, it became clear that some were getting more than others, and this made them seem more powerful, and so they became more powerful in fact, by association.Among this group were Vlad and Ursula (whom she suspected were more than friends, now), Frank, Sax all people who had been well known before their selection and none so much as John.So that any diminution in Earths regard for one of them might have a kind of corresponding effect on their status within the Ares.This at any rate seemed to be Franks operating principle.It felt as if they were confined to the interior of a hotel with no exits, without even any balconies.The oppression of hotel life was growing; they had been inside now for four long months, but it was still less than half their trip.And none of their carefully designed physical surroundings or daily routines could hasten its end.Then one morning the second flight team was dealing with another of Arkadys problem runs, when all at once red lights burned on several screens.A solar flare has been detected by the solar monitoring equipment, Rya said.Arkady stood quickly.Thats not me!he exclaimed, and leaned over to read the screen nearest him.He looked up, met his colleagues skeptical stares, grinned.Sorry, friends.This is the real wolf.An emergency message from Houston confirmed him.He could have faked those as well, but he was headed for the nearest spoke, and there was nothing they could do; fake or not, they had to follow.In fact, a big solar flare was an event they had simulated many times before.Everyone had tasks to perform, quite a few of them in a very short time, so they ran around the toruses, cursing their luck and trying not to get in each others way.There was a lot to do, as battening down was complicated, and not very automated.In the midst of dragging plant trays into the plant shelter Janet yelled, Is this one of Arkadys tests?He says not!Shit.They had left Earth during the low point in the eleven year sunspot cycle, specifically to reduce the chance of a flare like this occurring.And here it was anyway.They had about half an hour before the first radiation arrived, and no more than an hour after that the really hard stuff would follow.Emergencies in space can be as obvious as an explosion or as intangible as an equation, but their obviousness has nothing to do with how dangerous they are.The crews senses would never perceive the subatomic wind approaching them, and yet it was one of the worst things that could have happened.And everyone knew it.They ran through the toruses to get their bit of battening done plants had to be covered or moved to protected areas, the chickens and pigs and pygmy cows and the rest of the animals and birds had to be herded into their own little shelters, seeds and frozen embryos had to be collected and carried along, sensitive electrical components had to be boxed or likewise carried along.When they were done with these high speed tasks they yanked themselves up the spokes to the central shaft as fast as they could, and then flew down the central shaft tube to the storm shelter, which was directly behind the tubes aft end.Hiroko and her biosphere team were the last ones in, banging through the hatch a full twenty seven minutes after the initial alarm.They hurtled into the weightless space flushed and out of breath.Has it started yet?Not yet.They plucked personal dosimeters from a velcro rack of them, and pinned them to their clothing.The rest of the crew already floated in the semicylindrical chamber, breathing hard and nursing bruises and a few sprains.Maya ordered them to count off, and was relieved to hear the whole hundred run through without gaps.The room seemed very crowded.They hadnt gathered the whole hundred in one spot for many weeks, and even a max room didnt seem large enough.This one occupied a tank in the middle strand of the hub shaft.The four tanks surrounding theirs were filled with water, and their tank was divided lengthwise between their room and another semicylinder that had been filled with heavy metals.This semicylinders flat side was their floor, and it was fitted inside the tank on circular tracks, and rotated to counteract the spin of the ship, keeping the tub between the crew and the sun.So they floated in a nonrotating space, while the curved roof of the tank rotated over them at its usual four rpm.It was a peculiar sight, which along with the weightlessness made some people begin to look thoughtful in a preseasick kind of way.These unfortunates congregated down at the end of the shelter where the lavatories were located, and to help them out visually, everyone else oriented themselves to the floor.The radiation was therefore coming up through their feet, mostly gamma rays scattering out of the heavy metals.Maya felt an impulse to keep her knees together.People floated in place, or put on velcro slippers to walk over the floor.They talked in low voices, instinctively finding their next door neighbors, their working partners, their friends.Conversations were subdued, as if a cocktail party had been told that the hors doeuvres had been tainted.John Boone rip ripped his way to the computer terminals at the fore end of the room, where Arkady and Alex were monitoring the ship.He punched in a command, and the exterior radiation data were suddenly displayed on the rooms biggest screen.Lets see how much is hitting the ship, he said brightly.Groans.Must we?exclaimed Ursula.We might as well know, John said.And I want to see how well this shelter works.The one on the Rust Eagle was about as strong as the bib you wear at the dentists.Maya smiled.It was a reminder, rare from John, that he had been exposed to much more radiation than any of the rest of them about 160 rem over the course of his life, as he explained now in response to someones question.On Earth one caught a fifth of a roentgen equivalent man per year, and orbiting Earth, still inside the protection of the Earths magnetosphere, one took around thirty five per year.So John had taken a lot of heat, and somehow that gave him the right, now, to screen the exterior data if he wanted to.Those who were interested about sixty people clumped behind him to watch the screen.The rest relocated at the far end of the tank with the people worrying about motion sickness, a group that definitely didnt want to know how much radiation they were taking.Just the thought was enough to send some of them into the heads.Then the full force of the flare struck.The exterior radiation count shifted to well above the solar winds usual level, and then soared in a sudden rush.An indrawn hiss came from several observers at once, and there were some shocked exclamations.But look how much the shelter is stopping, John said, checking the dosimeter pinned to his shirt.Im still at only point three rem!That was several lifetimes of dentists X rays, to be sure, but the radiation outside the storm shelter was already 70 rem, well on its way to a lethal dose, so they were getting off lightly.Still, the amount flying through the rest of the ship!Billions of particles were penetrating the ship and colliding with the atoms of water and metal they were huddled behind; hundreds of millions were flying between these atoms and then through the atoms of their bodies, touching nothing, as if they were no more than ghosts.Still, thousands were striking atoms of flesh and bone.Most of those collisions were harmless but in all those thousands, there were in all probability one or two (or three?)in which a chromosome strand was taking a hit, and kinking in the wrong way: and there it was.Tumor initiation, begun with just that typo in the book of the self.And years later, unless the victims DNA luckily repaired itself, the tumor promotion that was a more or less unavoidable part of living would have its effect, and there would appear a bloom of Something Else inside: cancer.Leukemia, most likely; and, most likely, death.So it was hard not to regard the figures unhappily.1.4658 rem, 1.7861, 1.9004.
