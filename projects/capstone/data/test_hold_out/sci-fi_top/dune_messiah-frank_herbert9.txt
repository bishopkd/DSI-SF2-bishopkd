Duncan Idaho will awaken then. "The dwarf clapped his hands together.Hayt grunted, feeling that he had been interrupted in the middle of a thought...or perhaps in the middle of a sentence.What was it?Something about...targets?"You think to confuse me and manipulate me," he said."How is that?"Bijaz asked."I am your target and you can't deny it," Hayt said."I would not think of denying it. ""What is it you'd try to do with me?""A kindness," Bijaz said."A simple kindness. "= = = = = =   The sequential nature of actual events is not illuminated with lengthy precision by the powers of prescience except under the most extraordinary circumstances.The oracle grasps incidents cut out of the historic chain.Eternity moves.It inflicts itself upon the oracle and the supplicant alike.Let Muad'dib's subjects doubt his majesty and his oracular visions.Let them deny his powers.Let them never doubt Eternity.The Dune Gospels   Hayt watched Alia emerge from her temple and cross the plaza.Her guard was bunched close, fierce expressions on their faces to mask the lines molded by good living and complacency.A heliograph of 'thopter wings flashed in the bright afternoon sun above the temple, part of the Royal Guard with Muad'dib's fist symbol on its fuselage.Hayt returned his gaze to Alia.She looked out of place here in the city, he thought.Her proper setting was the desert   open, untrammeled space.An odd thing about her came back to him as he watched her approach: Alia appeared thoughtful only when she smiled.It was a trick of the eyes, he decided, recalling a cameo memory of her as she'd appeared at the reception for the Guild Ambassador: haughty against a background of music and brittle conversation among extravagant gowns and uniforms.And Alia had been wearing white, dazzling, a bright garment of chastity.He had looked down upon her from a window as she crossed an inner garden with its formal pond, its fluting fountains, fronds of pampas grass and a white belvedere.Entirely wrong...all wrong.She belonged in the desert.Hayt drew in a ragged breath.Alia had moved out of his view then as she did now.He waited, clenching and unclenching his fists.The interview with Bijaz had left him uneasy.He heard Alia's entourage pass outside the room where he waited.She went into the Family quarters.Now he tried to focus on the thing about her which troubled him.The way she'd walked across the plaza?Yes.She'd moved like a hunted creature fleeing some predator.He stepped out onto the connecting balcony, walked along it behind the plasmeld sunscreen, stopped while still in concealing shadows.Alia stood at the balustrade overlooking her temple.He looked where she was looking   out over the city.He saw rectangles, blocks of color, creeping movements of life and sound.Structures gleamed, shimmered.Heat patterns spiraled off the rooftops.There was a boy across the way bouncing a ball in a cul de sac formed by a buttressed massif at a corner of the temple.Back and forth the ball went.Alia, too, watched the ball.She felt a compelling identity with that ball   back and forth...back and forth.She sensed herself bouncing through corridors of Time.The potion of melange she'd drained just before leaving the temple was the largest she'd ever attempted   a massive overdose.Even before beginning to take effect, it had terrified her.Why did I do it?she asked herself."One made a choice between dangers. "Was that it?This was the way to penetrate the fog spread over the future by that damnable Dune Tarot.A barrier existed.It must be breached.She had acted out of a necessity to see where it was her brother walked with his eyeless stride.The familiar melange fugue state began creeping into her awareness.She took a deep breath, experienced a brittle form of calm, poised and selfless.Possession of second sight has a tendency to make one a dangerous fatalist, she thought.Unfortunately, there existed no abstract leverage, no calculus of prescience.Visions of the future could not be manipulated as formulas.One had to enter them, risking life and sanity.A figure moved from the harsh shadows of the adjoining balcony.The ghola!In her heightened awareness, Alia saw him with intense clarity   the dark, lively features dominated by those glistening metal eyes.He was a union of terrifying opposites, something put together in a shocking linear way.He was shadow and blazing light, a product of the process which had revived his dead flesh...and of something intensely pure...innocent.He was innocence under siege!"Have you been there all along, Duncan?"she asked."So I'm to be Duncan," he said."Why?""Don't question me," she said.And she thought, looking at him, that the Tleilaxu had left no corner of their ghola unfinished."Only gods can safely risk perfection," she said."It's a dangerous thing for a man. ""Duncan died," he said, wishing she would not call him that."I am Hayt. "She studied his artificial eyes, wondering what they saw.Observed closely, they betrayed tiny black pockmarks, little wells of darkness in the glittering metal.Facets!The universe shimmered around her and lurched.She steadied herself with a hand on the sun warmed surface of the balustrade.Ahhh, the melange moved swiftly."Are you ill?"Hayt asked.He moved closer, the steely eyes opened wide, staring.Who spoke?she wondered.Was it Duncan Idaho?Was it the mentat ghola or the Zensunni philosopher?Or was it a Tleilaxu pawn more dangerous than any Guild Steersman?Her brother knew.Again, she looked at the ghola.There was something inactive about him now, a latent something.He was saturated with waiting and with powers beyond their common life."Out of my mother, I am like the Bene Gesserit," she said."Do you know that?""I know it. ""I use their powers, think as they think.Part of me knows the sacred urgency of the breeding program...and its products. "She blinked, feeling part of her awareness begin to move freely in Time."It's said that the Bene Gesserit never let go," he said.And he watched her closely, noting how white her knuckles were where she gripped the edge of the balcony."Have I stumbled?"she asked.He marked how deeply she breathed, with tension in every movement, the glazed appearance of her eyes."When you stumble," he said, "you may regain your balance by jumping beyond the thing that tripped you. ""The Bene Gesserit stumbled," she said."Now they wish to regain their balance by leaping beyond my brother.They want Chani's baby...or mine. ""Are you with child?"She struggled to fix herself in a timespace relationship to this question.With child?When?Where?"I see...my child," she whispered.She moved away from the balcony's edge, turned her head to look at the ghola.He had a face of salt, bitter eyes   two circles of glistening lead...and, as he turned away from the light to follow her movement, blue shadows."What...do you see with such eyes?"she whispered."What other eyes see," he said.His words rang in her ears, stretching her awareness.She felt that she reached across the universe   such a stretching...out...out.She lay intertwined with all Time."You've taken the spice, a large dose," he said."Why can't I see him?"she muttered.The womb of all creation held her captive."Tell me, Duncan, why I cannot see him. ""Who can't you see?""I cannot see the father of my children.I'm lost in a Tarot fog.Help me. "Mentat logic offered its prime computation, and he said: "The Bene Gesserit want a mating between you and your brother.It would lock the genetic...  "A wail escaped her."The egg in the flesh," she gasped.A sensation of chill swept over her, followed by intense heat.The unseen mate of her darkest dreams!Flesh of her flesh that the oracle could not reveal   would it come to that?"Have you risked a dangerous dose of the spice?"he asked.Something within him fought to express the utmost terror at the thought that an Atreides woman might die, that Paul might face him with the knowledge that a female of the royal family had...gone."You don't know what it's like to hunt the future," she said."Sometimes I glimpse myself...but I get in my own way.I cannot see through myself. "She lowered her head, shook it from side to side."How much of the spice did you take?"he asked."Nature abhors prescience," she said, raising her head."Did you know that, Duncan?"He spoke softly, reasonably, as to a small child: "Tell me how much of the spice you took. "He took hold of her shoulder with his left hand."Words are such gross machinery, so primitive and ambiguous," she said.She pulled away from his hand."You must tell me," he said."Look at the Shield Wall," she commanded, pointing.She sent her gaze along her own outstretched hand, trembled as the landscape crumbled in an overwhelming vision   a sandcastle destroyed by invisible waves.She averted her eyes, was transfixed by the appearance of the ghola's face.His features crawled, became aged, then young...aged...young.He was life itself, assertive, endless...She turned to flee, but he grabbed her left wrist."I am going to summon a doctor," he said."No!You must let me have the vision!I have to know!""You are going inside now," he said.She stared down at his hand.Where their flesh touched, she felt an electric presence that both lured and frightened her.She jerked free, gasped: "You can't hold the whirlwind!""You must have medical help!"he snapped."Don't you understand?"she demanded."My vision's incomplete, just fragments.It flickers and jumps.I have to remember the future.Can't you see that?""What is the future if you die?"he asked, forcing her gently into the Family chambers."Words...words," she muttered."I can't explain it.One thing is the occasion of another thing, but there's no cause...no effect.We can't leave the universe as it was.Try as we may, there's a gap. ""Stretch out here," he commanded.He is so dense!she thought.Cool shadows enveloped her.She felt her own muscles crawling like worms   a firm bed that she knew to be insubstantial.Only space was permanent.Nothing else had substance.The bed flowed with many bodies, all of them her own.Time became a multiple sensation, overloaded.It presented no single reaction for her to abstract.It was Time.It moved.The whole universe slipped backward, forward, sideways."It has no thing aspect," she explained."You can't get under it or around it.There's no place to get leverage. "There came a fluttering of people all around her.Many someones held her left hand.She looked at her own moving flesh, followed a twining arm out to a fluid mask of face: Duncan Idaho!His eyes were...wrong, but it was Duncan   child man adolescent child man adolescent...Every line of his features betrayed concern for her."Duncan, don't be afraid," she whispered.He squeezed her hand, nodded."Be still," he said.And he thought: She must not die!She must not!No Atreides woman can die!He shook his head sharply.Such thoughts defied mentat logic.Death was a necessity that life might continue.The ghola loves me, Alia thought.The thought became bedrock to which she might cling.He was a familiar face with a solid room behind him.She recognized one of the bedrooms in Paul's suite.A fixed, immutable person did something with a tube in her throat.She fought against retching."We got her in time," a voice said, and she recognized the tones of a Family medic."You should've called me sooner. "There was suspicion in the medic's voice.She felt the tube slide out of her throat   a snake, a shimmering cord."The slapshot will make her sleep," the medic said."I'll send one of her attendants to  "  "I will stay with her," the ghola said."That is not seemly!"the medic snapped."Stay...Duncan," Alia whispered.He stroked her hand to tell her he'd heard."M'Lady," the medic said, "it'd be better if... ""You do not tell me what is best," she rasped.Her throat ached with each syllable."M'Lady," the medic said, voice accusing, "you know the dangers of consuming too much melange.I can only assume someone gave it to you without  "  "You are a fool," she rasped."Would you deny me my visions?I knew what I took and why. "She put a hand to her throat."Leave us.At once!"The medic pulled out of her field of vision, said: "I will send word to your brother. "She felt him leave, turned her attention to the ghola.The vision lay clearly in her awareness now, a culture medium in which the present grew outward.She sensed the ghola move in that play of Time, no longer cryptic, fixed now against a recognizable background.He is the crucible, she thought.He is danger and salvation.And she shuddered, knowing she saw the vision of her brother had seen.Unwanted tears burned her eyes.She shook her head sharply.No tears!They wasted moisture and, worse, distracted the harsh flow of vision.Paul must be stopped!Once, just once, she had bridged Time to place her voice where he would pass.But stress and mutability would not permit that here.The web of Time passed through her brother now like rays of light through a lens.He stood at the focus and he knew it.He had gathered all the lines to himself and would not permit them to escape or change."Why?"she muttered."Is it hate?Does he strike out at Time itself because it hurt him?Is that it...hate?"Thinking he heard her speak his name, the ghola said: "M'Lady?""If I could only burn this thing out of me!"she cried."I didn't want to be different. ""Please, Alia," he murmured."Let yourself sleep. ""I wanted to be able to laugh," she whispered.Tears slid down her cheeks."But I'm sister to an Emperor who's worshipped as a god.People fear me.I never wanted to be feared. "He wiped the tears from her face."I don't want to be part of history," she whispered."I just want to be loved...and to love. ""You are loved," he said."Ahhh, loyal, loyal Duncan," she said."Please, don't call me that," he pleaded."But you are," she said."And loyalty is a valued commodity.It can be sold...not bought, but sold. ""I don't like your cynicism," he said."Damn your logic!It's true!""Sleep," he said."Do you love me, Duncan?"she asked."Yes. ""Is that one of those lies," she asked, "one of the lies that are easier to believe than the truth?Why am I afraid to believe you?""You fear my differences as you fear your own. ""Be a man, not a mentat!"she snarled."I am a mentat and a man. ""Will you make me your woman, then?""I will do what love demands. ""And loyalty?""And loyalty. ""That's where you're dangerous," she said.Her words disturbed him.No sign of the disturbance arose to his face, no muscle trembled   but she knew it.Vision memory exposed the disturbance.She felt she had missed part of the vision, though, that she should remember something else from the future.There existed another perception which did not go precisely by the senses, a thing which fell into her head from nowhere the way prescience did.It lay in the Time shadows   infinitely painful.Emotion!That was it   emotion!It had appeared in the vision, not directly, but as a product from which she could infer what lay behind.She had been possessed by emotion   a single constriction made up of fear, grief and love.They lay there in the vision, all collected into a single epidemic body, overpowering and primordial."Duncan, don't let me go," she whispered."Sleep," he said."Don't fight it. ""I must...I must.He's the bait in his own trap.He's the servant of power and terror.Violence...deification is a prison enclosing him.He'll lose...everything.It'll tear him apart. ""You speak of Paul?""They drive him to destroy himself," she gasped, arching her back."Too much weight, too much grief.They seduce him away from love. "She sank back to the bed."They're creating a universe where he won't permit himself to live. ""Who is doing this?""He is!Ohhh, you're so dense.He's part of the pattern.And it's too late...too late...too late... "As she spoke, she felt her awareness descend, layer by layer.It came to rest directly behind her navel.Body and mind separated and merged in a storehouse of relic visions   moving, moving...She heard a fetal heartbeat, a child of the future.The melange still possessed her, then, setting her adrift in Time.She knew she had tasted the life of a child not yet conceived.One thing certain about this child   it would suffer the same awakening she had suffered.It would be an aware, thinking entity before birth.= = = = = =   There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves.Judging this limit is the true artistry of government.Misuse of power is the fatal sin.The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created.You cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences.Muad'dib on Law, The Stilgar Commentary   Chani stared out at the morning desert framed in the fault cleft below Sietch Tabr.She wore no stillsuit, and this made her feel unprotected here in the desert.The sietch grotto's entrance lay hidden in the buttressed cliff above and behind her.The desert...the desert...She felt that the desert had followed her wherever she had gone.Coming back to the desert was not so much a homecoming as a turning around to see what had always been there.A painful constriction surged through her abdomen.The birth would be soon.She fought down the pain, wanting this moment alone with her desert.Dawn stillness gripped the land.Shadows fled among the dunes and terraces of the Shield Wall all around.Daylight lunged over the high scarp and plunged her up to her eyes in a bleak landscape stretching beneath a washed blue sky.The scene matched the feeling of dreadful cynicism which had tormented her since the moment she'd learned of Paul's blindness.Why are we here?she wondered.It was not a hajra, a journey of seeking.Paul sought nothing here except, perhaps, a place for her to give birth.He had summoned odd companions for this journey, she thought   Bijaz, the Tleilaxu dwarf; the ghola, Hayt, who might be Duncan Idaho's revenant; Edric, the Guild Steersman Ambassador; Gaius Helen Mohiam, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother he so obviously hated; Lichna, Otheym's strange daughter, who seemed unable to move beyond the watchful eyes of guards; Stilgar, her uncle of the Naibs, and his favorite wife, Harah...and Irulan...Alia...The sound of wind through the rocks accompanied her thoughts.The desert day had become yellow on yellow, tan on tan, gray on gray.Why such a strange mixture of companions?"We have forgotten," Paul had said in response to her question, "that the word 'company' originally meant traveling companions.We are a company. ""But what value are they?""There!"he'd said, turning his frightful sockets toward her."We've lost that clear, single note of living.If it cannot be bottled, beaten, pointed or hoarded, we give it no value. "Hurt, she'd said: "That's not what I meant. ""Ahhh, dearest one," he'd said, soothing, "we are so money rich and so life poor.I am evil, obstinate, stupid...  ""You are not!""That, too, is true.But my hands are blue with time.I think...I think I tried to invent life, not realizing it'd already been invented. "And he'd touched her abdomen to feel the new life there.Remembering, she placed both hands over her abdomen and trembled, sorry that she'd asked Paul to bring her here.The desert wind had stirred up evil odors from the fringe plantings which anchored the dunes at the cliff base.Fremen superstition gripped her: evil odors, evil times.She faced into the wind, saw a worm appear outside the plantings.It arose like the prow of a demon ship out of the dunes, threshed sand, smelled the water deadly to its kind, and fled beneath a long, burrowing mound.She hated the water then, inspired by the worm's fear.Water, once the spirit soul of Arrakis, had become a poison.Water brought pestilence.Only the desert was clean.Below her, a Fremen work gang appeared.They climbed to the sietch's middle entrance, and she saw that they had muddy feet.Fremen with muddy feet!The children of the sietch began singing to the morning above her, their voices piping from the upper entrance.The voices made her feel time fleeing from her like hawks before the wind.She shuddered.What storms did Paul see with his eyeless vision?She sensed a vicious madman in him, someone weary of songs and polemics.The sky, she noted, had become crystal gray filled with alabaster rays, bizarre designs etched across the heavens by windborne sand.A line of gleaming white in the south caught her attention.Eves suddenly alerted, she interpreted the sign: White sky in the south: Shai hulud's mouth.A storm came, big wind.She felt the warning breeze, a crystal blowing of sand against her cheeks.The incense of death came on the wind: odors of water flowing in qanats, sweating sand, flint.The water   that was why Shai hulud sent his coriolis wind.Hawks appeared in the cleft where she stood, seeking safety from the wind.They were brown as the rocks and with scarlet in their wings.She felt her spirit go out to them: they had a place to hide; she had none."M'Lady, the wind comes!"She turned, saw the ghola calling to her outside the upper entrance to the sietch.Fremen fears gripped her.Clean death and the body's water claimed for the tribe, these she understood.But...something brought back from death...Windblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks.She glanced over her shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky.The desert beneath the storm had taken on a tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea.She hesitated, caught by a feeling of the desert's transience.Measured against eternity, this was no more than a caldron.Dune surf thundered against cliffs.The storm out there had become a universal thing for her   all the animals hiding from it...nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds: blown sand scraping along rock, a wind surge whistling, the gallop of a boulder tumbled suddenly from its hill   then!somewhere out of sight, a capsized worm thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths.It was only a moment as her life measured time, but in that moment she felt this planet being swept away   cosmic dust, part of other waves."We must hurry," the ghola said from right beside her.She sensed fear in him then, concern for her safety."It'll shred the flesh from your bones," he said, as though he needed to explain such a storm to her.Her fear of him dispelled by his obvious concern, Chani allowed the ghola to help her up the rock stairway to the sietch.They entered the twisting baffle which protected the entrance.Attendants opened the moisture seals, closed them behind.Sietch odors assaulted her nostrils.The place was a ferment of nasal memories   the warren closeness of bodies, rank esters of the reclamation stills, familiar food aromas, the flinty burning of machines at work...and through it all, the omnipresent spice: melange everywhere.She took a deep breath."Home. "The ghola took his hand from her arm, stood aside, a patient figure now, almost as though turned off when not in use.Yet...he watched.Chani hesitated in the entrance chamber, puzzled by something she could not name.This was truly her home.As a child, she'd hunted scorpions here by glowglobe light.Something was changed, though..."Shouldn't you be going to your quarters, m'Lady?"the ghola asked.As though ignited by his words, a rippling birth constriction seized her abdomen.She fought against revealing it."M'Lady?"the ghola said."Why is Paul afraid for me to bear our children?"she asked."It is a natural thing to fear for your safety," the ghola said.She put a hand to her cheek where the sand had reddened it."And he doesn't fear for the children?""M'Lady, he cannot think of a child without remembering that your firstborn was slain by the Sardaukar. "She studied the ghola   flat face, unreadable mechanical eyes.Was he truly Duncan Idaho, this creature?Was he friend to anyone?Had he spoken truthfully now?"You should be with the medics," the ghola said.Again, she heard the fear for her safety in his voice.She felt abruptly that her mind lay undefended, ready to be invaded by shocking perceptions."Hayt, I'm afraid," she whispered."Where is my Usul?""Affairs of state detain him," the ghola said.She nodded, thinking of the government apparatus which had accompanied them in a great flight of ornithopters.Abruptly, she realized what puzzled her about the sietch: outworld odors.The clerks and aides had brought their own perfumes into this environment, aromas of diet and clothing, of exotic toiletries.They were an undercurrent of odors here.Chani shook herself, concealing an urge to bitter laughter.Even the smells changed in Muad'dib's presence!"There were pressing matters which he could not defer," the ghola said, misreading her hesitation."Yes...yes, I understand.I came with that swarm, too. "Recalling the flight from Arrakeen, she admitted to herself now that she had not expected to survive it.Paul had insisted on piloting his own 'thopter.Eyeless, he had guided the machine here.After that experience, she knew nothing he did could surprise her.Another pain fanned out through her abdomen.The ghola saw her indrawn breath, the tightening of her cheeks, said: "Is it your time?""I. ..yes, it is. ""You must not delay," he said.He grasped her arm, hurried her down the hall.She sensed panic in him, said: "There's time. "He seemed not to hear."The Zensunni approach to birth," he said, urging her even faster, "is to wait without purpose in the state of highest tension.Do not compete with what is happening.To compete is to prepare for failure.Do not be trapped by the need to achieve anything.This way, you achieve everything. "While he spoke, they reached the entrance to her quarters.He thrust her through the hangings, cried out: "Harah!Harah!It is Chani's time.Summon the medics!"His call brought attendants running.There was a great bustling of people in which Chani felt herself an isolated island of calm...until the next pain came.Hayt, dismissed to the outer passage, took time to wonder at his own actions.He felt fixated at some point of time where all truths were only temporary.Panic lay beneath his actions, he realized.Panic centered not on the possibility that Chani might die, but that Paul should come to him afterward...filled with grief...his loved one...gone...gone...Something cannot emerge from nothing, the ghola told himself.From what does this panic emerge?He felt that his mentat faculties had been dulled, let out a long, shuddering breath.A psychic shadow passed over him.In the emotional darkness of it, he felt himself waiting for some absolute sound   the snap of a branch in a jungle.A sigh shook him.Danger had passed without striking.Slowly, marshaling his powers, shedding bits of inhibition, he sank into mentat awareness.He forced it   not the best way   but somehow necessary.Ghost shadows moved within him in place of people.He was a transshipping station for every datum he had ever encountered.His being was inhabited by creatures of possibility.They passed in review to be compared, judged.Perspiration broke out on his forehead.Thoughts with fuzzy edges feathered away into darkness   unknown.Infinite systems!A mentat could not function without realizing he worked in infinite systems.Fixed knowledge could not surround the infinite.Everywhere could not be brought into finite perspective.Instead, he must become the infinite   momentarily.In one gestalten spasm, he had it, seeing Bijaz seated before him blazing from some inner fire.Bijaz!The dwarf had done something to him!Hayt felt himself teetering on the lip of a deadly pit.He projected the mentat computation line forward, seeing what could develop out of his own actions."A compulsion!"he gasped."I've been rigged with a compulsion!"A blue robed courier, passing as Hayt spoke, hesitated."Did you say something, sirra?"Not looking at him, the ghola nodded."I said everything. "= = = = = =   There was a man so wise, He jumped into A sandy place And burnt out both his eyes!And when he knew his eyes were gone, He offered no complaint.He summoned up a vision And made himself a saint.Children's Verse from History of Muad'dib   Paul stood in darkness outside the sietch.Oracular vision told him it was night, that moonlight silhouetted the shrine atop Chin Rock high on his left.This was a memory saturated place, his first sietch, where he and Chani...I must not think of Chani, he told himself.The thinning cup of his vision told him of changes all around   a cluster of palms far down to the right, the black silver line of a qanat carrying water through the dunes piled up by that morning's storm.Water flowing in the desert!He recalled another kind of water flowing in a river of his birthworld, Caladan.He hadn't realized then the treasure of such a flow, even the murky slithering in a qanat across a desert basin.Treasure.With a delicate cough, an aide came up from behind.Paul held out his hands for a magnabord with a single sheet of metallic paper on it.He moved as sluggishly as the qanat's water.The vision flowed, but he found himself increasingly reluctant to move with it."Pardon, Sire," the aide said."The Semboule Treaty   your signature?""I can read it!"Paul snapped.He scrawled "Atreides Imper. "in the proper place, returned the board, thrusting it directly into the aide's outstretched hand, aware of the fear this inspired.The man fled.Paul turned away.Ugly, barren land!He imagined it sun soaked and monstrous with heat, a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools, blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks, their narrow bellies full of ochre crystals.But it was a rich land, too: big, exploding out of narrow places with vistas of storm trodden emptiness, rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges.All it required was water...and love.Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he thought.That was the message of the desert.Contrast stunned him with realization.He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life   all life, every last crawling bit of it!We're all in this beauty together!They wouldn't understand.In the desert, they were endlessly desert.Growing things performed no green ballet for them.He clenched his fists at his sides, trying to halt the vision.He wanted to flee from his own mind.It was a beast come to devour him!Awareness lay in him, sodden, heavy with all the living it had sponged up, saturated with too many experiences.Desperately, Paul squeezed his thoughts outward.Stars!Awareness turned over at the thought of all those stars above him   an infinite volume.A man must be half mad to imagine he could rule even a teardrop of that volume.He couldn't begin to imagine the number of subjects his Imperium claimed.Subjects?Worshippers and enemies, more likely.Did any among them see beyond rigid beliefs?Where was one man who'd escaped the narrow destiny of his prejudices?Not even an Emperor escaped.He'd lived a 'take everything' life, tried to create a universe in his own image.But the exultant universe was breaking across him at last with its silent waves.I spit on Dune!he thought.I give it my moisture!This myth he'd made out of intricate movements and imagination, out of moonlight and love, out of prayers older than Adam, and gray cliffs and crimson shadows, laments and rivers of martyrs   what had it come to at last?When the waves receded, the shores of Time would spread out there clean, empty, shining with infinite grains of memory and little else.Was this the golden genesis of man?Sand scuffed against rocks told him that the ghola had joined him."You've been avoiding me today, Duncan," Paul said."It's dangerous for you to call me that," the ghola said."I know. ""I. ..came to warn you, m'Lord. ""I know. "The story of the compulsion Bijaz had put on him poured from the ghola then."Do you know the nature of the compulsion?"Paul asked."Violence. "Paul felt himself arriving at a place which had claimed him from the beginning.He stood suspended.The Jihad had seized him, fixed him onto a glidepath from which the terrible gravity of the Future would never release him."There'll be no violence from Duncan," Paul whispered."But, Sire...  ""Tell me what you see around us," Paul said."M'Lord?""The desert   how is it tonight?""Don't you see it?""I have no eyes, Duncan. ""But...  ""I've only my vision," Paul said, "and wish I didn't have it.I'm dying of prescience, did you know that, Duncan?""Perhaps...what you fear won't happen," the ghola said."What?Deny my own oracle?How can I when I've seen it fulfilled thousands of time?People call it a power, a gift.It's an affliction!It won't let me leave my life where I found it!""M'Lord," the ghola muttered, "I. ..it isn't...young master, you don't...I. ..  "He fell silent.Paul sensed the ghola's confusion, said: "What'd you call me, Duncan?""What?What I. ..for a moment... ""You called me 'young master. '"  "I did, yes. ""That's what Duncan always called me. "Paul reached out, touched the ghola's face."Was that part of your Tleilaxu training?""No. "Paul lowered his hand."What, then?""It came from...me. ""Do you serve two masters?""Perhaps. ""Free yourself from the ghola, Duncan. ""How?""You're human.Do a human thing. ""I'm a ghola!""But your flesh is human.Duncan's in there. ""Something's in there. ""I care not how you do it," Paul said, "but you'll do it.
