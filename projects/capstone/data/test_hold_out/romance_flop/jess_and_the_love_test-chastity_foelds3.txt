DAngelo, Isabella said.Im not sure I should.Cmon!Tell me!Fine, Isabella said.I have one of these subliminal circuit boards inside Bills car.An hour each way to work allows for a lot of subconscious programming time.So you know it works.Im certain it works, Isabella said.Look, I know what youre thinking.Isabella fixed Jess with a knowing gaze.Is it just the sex thats dried up, or has Anthonys love for you dried up too?This will out the truth.If its just a rut you guys are in, this will rekindle his passion for you.If not, and its over, youll be able to tell.Youll know for sure.Damn Isabella!She had somehow figured out exactly what was on Jesss mind.Did Anthony not love her any more?Or was this just the natural course of any long relationship?At least Isabella didnt mention Jesss darkest fear was Anthony having an affair?So what will this subconscious programming make him do?Jess asked.Its mild, Isabella said.Itll just make him more oral.Hell talk more?Isabella got a playful glint in her eye.No, silly.Hell want to kiss you more.Jess thought about it for a bit, but not long.Well thatd be nice.What would be the harm?It wasnt like she was violating his privacy or anything.Anthony should want to kiss his wife.Jess nodded her head.Lets do it, she said.It wont take long, will it?Anthony will be back with my Mercedes in about three hours.No, Isabella said.My loverI mean, my friend, will bang this out lickety split.Shes very good at what she does.Isabella added, with a twinkle of the eye, at everything she does.Your lover is a she?Jess giggled.Youre baaad.You have no idea.3   Jess was just ladling the linguini into the cast iron frying pan filled with mussels and clams fully popped, broth at a slow boil, when she heard the garage door open.In moments Anthony came swooping into the room.It wasnt that her husband was in a rush he swooped into every room he entered.Boots off, dear, Jess reminded.Anthony stepped back to the mudroom and took off his construction boots.Despite being a big man, Anthony bent over with an easy athleticism that a twenty year old would envy.A day didnt go by that Anthony didnt hit the gym, and his body showed it.Being big and brutally strong was required in Anthonys line of work, where he regularly had to tune guys up.Jess never asked her husband about his work.Most mafia wives didnt.It was for the best.If you didnt know anything, you couldnt be called to testify.Jess often wondered if Anthonys mafia ties were the source of his impulse to gay bash.The mafia was not a progressive organization in the least.I hope you got that furniture moved for your friend, Anthony said.I need my truck tomorrow.I drive up in a Mercedes and everyone thinks Im rich, and then they start thinking they dont have to pay me, and that slows me down.Slows you down?Jess asked.Having to remind people that they need to respect me, that takes time, Anthony said.Ah, tuning people up.Jess had only seen Anthony tune someone up once, in all their years of marriage.It was brutal, and it was bloody, and it bothered Jess that she got extremely turned on watching Anthony use his bare hands to bludgeon that guy, battering him to the ground.What did that say about her?Afterwards, Anthony had smelled so manly, a mixture of sweat and blood not his that Jess had jumped his bones.Of course, that was years ago.Smells good, Anthony said.No kiss, no hug, no how was your day.Isabella was rightJess needed to use that subliminal programming.There was nothing wrong with doing it, was there?Why did it feel like Jess was violating a trust?Her husband lumbered off to the half bath in the hallway, washed up, and then sat down at the dining room table, waiting for Jess to serve him.Im a scullery maid in my own house.
