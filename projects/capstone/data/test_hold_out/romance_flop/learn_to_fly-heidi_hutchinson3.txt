E spoke to Lenny more than him and he started to get huffy.When they were getting ready to leave, E gave her number to Lenny to keep in contact.Lenny was excited; she didn't have many friends who she could talk with about fitness anymore.Gimme her number, Lenny.Sway begged like a toddler after they had returned to the bus.No, Sway.If she wanted you to have it, she would have given it to you.Lenny staunchly refused.Please, Lenny!Sway dropped to the floor of the bus in a pleading posture, I have to talk to her again.Why this girl, Sway?Lenny raised an eyebrow at him.You didn't even talk to the two slutties drooling all over you.I almost had to hose them down.What made this girl so important to you?Sway pulled himself up off the floor and threw his body into a chair.You wouldn't get it, he grumbled.Lenny crossed her arms and waited.He ran his hands through his long hair a few times and sighed heavily.I met her in Spain awhile back.She turned me down then too.She didn't mention that, Lenny said thoughtfully.She's the only girl to turn me down, he looked over at Lenny and rolled his eyes, Besides you.So, you just want what you can't have?Lenny was disgusted.No, she's...aww forget it.Sway waived his hand at her dismissively, I'm going to get some sleep.He trudged towards the back of the bus.What was that about?Harrison asked as he handed Lenny a water bottle and sat down on the floor.I'm not totally sure, Lenny frowned down at her water.You wanna kill some zombies with me?Harrison asked hopefully.It didn't matter how late a show went or long they'd all been awake, Harrison loved to play video games.Might as well.Lenny smiled and tousled his hair as she sank to the floor beside him.The label heard that Travis Cline had tried to pick a fight with a girl at a bar in Virginia Beach and pulled Juniper Highlights off the tour the next morning.They didnt have enough clout for the company to take that kind of a risk.Lenny was pleased, it served them right.But that meant Double Blind Study didnt have an opener.Harrison suggested they use local bands at every venue, giving new talent a platform.It was an instant hit, increasing the bands reputation for staying true to their humble beginnings.Additional things had changed since that night.The dynamic had shifted between Lenny and Carl.She was going to have to get a lot closer to the guys to prevent what had happened in Virginia.That meant distancing herself from Carl a little more and staying nights on the band's respective buses.He appeared to understand her point of view and respected it.He had asked her to walk a fine line and he seemed satisfied with how the situation was evolving.He gave the guys a little more space, and only really saw Lenny when she brought him coffee in the mornings.They were coming up on another day off and the anticipation was palpable.The crew was looking forward to blowing off some steam, but the band wasnt sure what they were going to do yet.Blakes foray into bar top stripper had made them a little more wary of letting loose.Maybe we should just practice, Mike suggested from his seat in the corner.They were all riding in the Red Bus as the convoy traveled to their next venue.Lenny had been surprised at how much time they actually spent together.It was a lot.She had assumed that bands got on each other's nerves and needed their space.Or maybe that was just girls in high school.Thats a pretty good idea, actually, Luke concurred with his friend.Sway and Blake groaned in unison.Harrison had no response except the occasional grunt as he decapitated a zombie.I hate this game, Lenny said under her breath from beside him.Lenny, you said you had ideas for how we could demonstrate our manhood, Blake stated flatly.The guys chuckled and Lenny turned a wary eye over her shoulder.Yeah she said noncommittally.What can we do tomorrow to be men?Blake folded his hands in his lap.Lenny smiled at his phrasing and bit her lip.Im glad you asked, actually.I already set something up for us tomorrow.She turned around as her avatar died and Harrison let out a whimper.All of us?Blake asked, one black eyebrow raised.Yep.Should be fun.And dangerous enough to keep you out of trouble.Lenny stood up and stretched her cramped legs.Harrison needed a new hobby, this was going to wreck her knees.The guys tried to persuade her to reveal her idea but she remained tight lipped.Ive already cleared it with Carl   You clear everything with Carl, Sway grumbled.That guy is sooo boring.Hes not that bad, Lenny defended, He has a job to do and I respect that, you should too.She chuckled as Sway rolled his eyes at her.You know, you guys arent always puppy dogs and ice cream either.Im actually hurt that you would say that, Mike remarked as she plopped down on the sofa next to him and he threw an arm across her shoulders.I strive to always act as puppy like as possible.She laughed and shoved his leg.Ha ha ha, she said sarcastically but her smile was genuine.Cmon, just tell us what the big plan is.Harrisons eyes were round and dark with pretend innocence.His mother mustve had a hard time trying to keep him honest, Lenny thought with amusement.Nope, youll just have to trust me.She crossed her arms over her chest and leaned back against the couch, signaling the argument was over.The guys grumbled a little while more, a common occurrence as they started to wind down from their performance.It wasn't too much longer and they crawled into their bunks one by one until only Luke and Lenny were still awake.They continued to visit quietly but Lenny was very aware of the shift in mood after everyone had gone to bed.It had predictably become more...intimate.He could make her palms sweat with a look.Not to mention the fact that whenever they were alone her body suddenly wanted to fall asleep.It was like it knew that Luke had dark powers that could cause her body to relax and finally rest for unspecified amounts of time.It wanted to curl up against him and lose all connection to reality.She hated her body.Traitor.You should probably get some sleep, too, she reminded Luke.His face fell slightly at her sudden subject change and she wished things didn't have to be so complex between them.What about you?He asked with uncertainty.What do you mean?Lenny felt her heart rate quicken.Stop it!Calm down!She scolded it internally.You don't sleep much...do you?Luke's gentle confrontation left her without an explanation.She could lie to anyone.Her parents, her brothers, her friends.But not him.It was way too hard and required too much cognitive function, which she was somehow lacking in his presence.Not quite, she finally muttered.Why not?It was a simple question.Lenny wished she had a simple answer.What could she really say?Sure, they had gotten closer during their morning runs every day and Lenny considered him a friend.He told her anything and everything about himself, becoming transparent and real.But there was still so much he didn't know about her.She could change that.She could answer his question honestly and open up to him.It was only fair.Oh, boy.I was in an...accident, a few years ago.Lenny started slow, her hands beginning to tremble.She hadn't talked about this with anyone in a very long time.She clasped her hands in her lap and squeezed them together.What kind of an accident?Luke's quiet voice prompted.Lenny took a deep breath.This sucked.Where the hell was she supposed to start?If she told Luke everything then...then what?Then he'd know.I used to snowboard, she said flatly, the words falling onto the floor of the bus with a thud.There it was, in the open, her secret.She raised her eyes to meet his confused expression.Like, professionally?Luke sat up straighter in his chair and leaned forward.Lenny blew air out of her mouth.Why did he have to be so interested in her crappy past?How was she supposed to explain all of this without coming across like a dick?Yeah...I was an Olympic contender.Shit.Now she sounded arrogant.Luke's eyebrows rose, That sounds like a big deal.Lenny closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose.Here comes the headache.When did things stop being black and white?Where did all this gray shit come from?Yeah, she declared more forcefully than she intended.She dropped her hand back to her lap and tried again.Yeah, it was a big deal.Luke waited patiently for her to proceed and Lenny fought back the urge to jump out of the moving bus.I come from a family of athletes.We're all awesome.Her sarcastic tone made Luke chuckle and she relaxed a little.I started snowboarding when I was a little kid and decided that's what I wanted to do for...she shrugged, Well, forever.Lenny paused as the memories rushed in.The purity of the excitement.The adrenaline spike of a good run.My best friend's uncle, Duke, was pro at the time and he took me under his wing.Taught me everything he knew.He was wild.He encouraged us to be risky and find our own lines off the normal, protected ski routes.She shook her head, reminiscing.My parents were totally freaked out.They wanted me to have regular lessons and train in a more controlled environment.But thats the appeal of snowboarding, there are very few rules.It has a freedom of expression that other sports are lacking.I got better and started winning competitions.My parents were upset at first that I wasn't pursuing a more 'traditional' sport but...she smiled wistfully, They eventually got on board.My first Olympics, two years ago...almost three now, I thought I was ready, her voice cracked and she tried to swallow the ache away, I wasn't.I lost control and wrecked.How bad?Luke finally asked after a few minutes of silence had passed.Oh, you know, the usual head trauma, broken bones.Stuff like that.Lenny saw the distress on Luke's face and she felt stripped.Raw.When he looked at her, he saw her.Crushed spirit and all.And it terrified her.I'm fine now.I made a full recovery, completed all my therapy and I'm clear for launch, she laughed, trying to brush off the severity of her injuries, but it was obviously forced.Luke frowned at her and cleared his throat, But you don't sleep.Ah, Lenny waved carelessly It's just leftover side effects from having your body crushed.I sleep a little.But then the muscle spasms and the anxiety take over and...you know what?Lenny cut herself off and shook her head with embarrassment, It's not a big deal.It's totally fine.It's not fine, Luke confronted.He suddenly crossed to sit next to her on the couch.He reached up, brushing the hair over her shoulder and touched the tense spot behind her neck, This.This isn't fine.His fingers began their magical movements, releasing the negative energy that seemed to pool in that area.And you slept just fine in my arms, his voice, warm and rough, reminded very near her ear.I guess...Lenny sought an explanation, one she hadn't figured out yet.I guess, you make me feel safe.She thought she heard Luke sigh but she couldn't be sure.She shouldn't have said that.She shouldn't have said any of the things she had said to him tonight.She was losing control of her faculties.This only happened around him.You are safe with me, Luke gently pulled her into his arms as he reclined on the sofa.He tucked her body between his and the couch, keeping her head on his chest.His fingers stayed on the back of her neck, slowly removing the ache, while his other hand pulled her arm across him, completing the embrace.Lenny's body was flush against his and her heart hammered in her chest.If one of the guys came back to the main lounge or if Carl caught them   I don't want you to worry anymore, Luke broke into her thoughts.I didn't say anything, Lenny defended.I can feel you tensing up again, he tapped her neck with his fingertips, Just relax.This isn't anything more than a friend helping out another friend.Lenny fought the heaviness in her eyelids.Friends.Is this what it was like to have friends?She slowly traced the black swirl of ink that started on his forearm and disappeared under his shirt sleeve.She inhaled his scent, a mixture of soap and spearmint, and sighed.She couldnt let feelings develop for him.It wouldnt be fair to him or her, for that matter.After the tour was over they would go different ways.She focused on the reason she got this job in the first place, to get away and start new.He was a rock star, she was the assistant.At best, they were friends, but it couldnt be more than that.Besides, Luke Casey deserved someone better than a broken girl from nowhere.It was her last thought before she slipped into peaceful unconsciousness.When Luke woke up the next morning, Lenny was already gone.The buses had stopped sometime around dawn but he wasnt sure when she had left.He wasn't too surprised.He knew he was pushing every boundary she had set up between them since the beginning.But he couldn't help it, from the moment he had first met her, he couldn't resist her.When he found out he could offer her the peace she had been lacking, he jumped at it.He had tried to stay awake as long as possible, just enjoying the feel of her in his arms.Her softness and warmth, it was a closeness he'd never experienced with anyone.It was terrifying.And perfect.Luke tried to push the burning apprehension in his gut further downward.He hoped she wouldn't feel weird around him today.He wanted this to be a step forward, not back.He joined the guys after his shower and they began to speculate what plans Lenny might have for them.They discussed skydiving, water skiing or maybe even makeovers.Id be down for a makeover.Harrison looked at his hair in the reflection of the chrome on the side of the bus and primped a little, As long as I get to keep my hair.Lenny pulled up in a rented van and they all piled in.They chattered the whole time, trying to get Lenny to tell them where they were going.She remained secretive for the whole forty minute drive out of town.Then the van pulled onto a gravel road that wound up into the gorgeous Smokey Mountains.She stopped at a ramshackle cabin with a saggy roof.As the guys quietly piled out of the van, an older gentleman came out of the cabin and approached Lenny.His hair was gray and thinning at the temples but he moved with the energy of a much younger man.He was obviously fit and carried himself with a dignity that had been earned.Lenny Evans, it really is you!He grabbed her in a hug.I havent seen you sinceoh, its got to have been four or five years now.The band looked on, silent.They knew each other?Last time you were here you had that friend of yours with you, whats her name?Cody?Did she come along this time?The old timer looked around.Lenny laughed and shook her head, Not this time, Dale.Luke frowned as a stray memory tried to connect in his brain.Cody?He knew that name from somewhere  Guys, Lenny addressed her group, This is Dale Larson, he owns this shop and hes agreed to set us up for the day.For what?Harrison asked, surveying the surrounding mountains.Mountain biking.All day.She said it like she had expected them to have it figured out already.The guys were definitely surprised.Maybe a little nervous but Lenny seemed confident that they were going to do just fine.Dale set them up with bikes and helmets and various supplies like water and snacks.He gave all of them different degrees of instruction but nothing really specific, then he turned them over to Lenny.Whatever happens, keep your eyes on the lead dog, he rested his hand on Lennys shoulder, Thats this girl, right here.Shes the best Ive ever seen on a trail and shell show you how its done.With that, he bid them farewell and retreated back into his cabin.Lenny wasted no time; she climbed onto her bike and headed down the road.The guys had no choice but to follow.She tried not to push them too hard at first.She had extra energy she was trying to burn off and she didn't need to take it out on them.Waking up in Luke's arms that morning had left her feeling a combination of unparalleled rejuvenation and bewilderment.She had slowly peeled herself out of his embrace and promptly begun avoiding him and any conversation having to do with him.She had no idea what was going to come of this new development in their friendship.But she was pretty sure that they were dancing on the edge of the traditional definition of just friends.Blake caught up to her first, Hate to bust your balls, but I think I know how to ride a bike.Lenny grinned and ducked off the main road and onto a narrow trail heading uphill.She kept glancing behind her to make sure she hadnt lost anyone.She laughed to herself every time she heard one of them holler in surprise.She pushed them to what she knew was their limit, but nothing too risky or dangerous.As they continued their climb she heard grumblings in the back for a water break.She knew there was a place that leveled off up ahead and she would let them rest when they reached it.As the last member entered the clearing, Lenny took her helmet off and released her sweaty hair from its tight ponytail.She smoothed it back and replaced the elastic.Then she passed out sandwiches and water, making sure the guys stayed hydrated.How much further?Harrison puffed.You wanna head back?Lenny offered.No, well keep going.Luke answered; he was barely winded and grinning from ear to ear.He patted Harrison on the back, The fresh air is good for you.Its a good thing none of us are smokers, Sway joked.Yeah, Carl would be dead by now, Blake laughed.Lenny smiled at her band of tattooed misfits.They had quickly become her favorite people in the whole world.She finished her sandwich and walked over to a ledge overlooking the forest below.Mike walked up next to her and whistled.Thats an amazing view.Lenny agreed.Mike studied her expression quizzically and asked, What other extreme sports do you take part in?Lenny took a deep breath of the mountain air and smiled.She turned toward the group and answered, I hang out with rock stars.Luke pulled his bike up next to Lennys and handed her her helmet.Ready, Captain?He asked her, testing the waters of their friendship.Not knowing if she regretted trusting him the night before with her secrets.Ready.She buckled the chin strap and smiled up at Luke.If she was ashamed, she wasn't showing it.Youre gorgeous, he blurted out, not really thinking.You too, she teased back.You seem to be doing pretty good on the trail, she complimented.I like a challenge, Luke winked.Lenny raised her eyebrows and mounted her bike, Well then, Ill race you to the top.And she was off.Luke shook his head and sped after her.He had never met anyone with so much passion for everything they did.He loved the way she never stopped going after something and how she managed to completely master something new.He wanted to see how fast he could teach her guitar.Besides, that would offer more opportunity for them to be alone together.He tried to shake off the excited feeling he got when he thought about sitting with her, alone, just talking.He thought about kissing her all the time.Constantly.But he wasn't about to make her uncomfortable.It would be alright, he would be patient until she trusted him.He was enjoying every minute they spent together anyway.That included hanging with a bunch of people or talking late into the night on the bus.Lenny beat him to the top and took off her helmet with a big smile.Was that challenging enough for you?Luke nodded, trying to catch his breath, Well done.They had a few minutes alone as they waited for the rest of the group to catch up and Luke plunged ahead with his just born idea.You should ride on the Blue Bus with us after tomorrow night's show.I want to try to teach you how to play.Play what?Lennys brows frowned.The guitar.Luke answered like it was obvious.Why do you want to teach me the guitar?Lennys frown deepened.Youre good at everything you do.Not just good, youre the best.I wanna see how fast you learn it.Lenny shrugged, I suppose its worth a shot.And then maybe you can teach me something I dont know how to do.He was trying to be subtle but he still wanted her to pick up on the undertone of his suggestion.If she did, he would never know because the guys came huffing and puffing their way up the trail.So its settled, youll ride with me and Mike after tomorrows show?He wanted her confirmation, knowing she wouldnt go back on her word.You got it.She smiled openly at him and then greeted the stragglers, Hello, Lovelies.How do you feel?Im not gonna lie, Len, I feel like a man.Blake confessed and they all laughed out loud.Good job, mama, he complimented her as he patted her back.Lenny let them rest and enjoy the scenery for a while before turning them back down the hill.The ride to the starting point was quiet and Lenny took it easy on them.When they got back to the cabin, they thanked Dale for the loaned equipment and collapsed into the van.They were all too exhausted to even think about going out later.Which, Luke suspected, had been Lenny's plan all along.Lenny took a longer drive through the mountains instead of driving straight back to the venue.Most of the guys fell asleep right away and the radio played soft country music as she wound her way along the tight mountain highway.Luke sat in the front seat with her and watched her face as she drove along carefully.I miss the mountains.She said it so quietly Luke would have missed it if he hadnt been looking at her.Luke reached over and took her hand gently in his.He didnt say anything and she didnt look at him.He kept her hand in his, resting on the middle seat between them.His thumb softly stroked the tops of her fingers.When they pulled into the parking lot, she tugged her hand free of his grasp.As she parked, she smiled apologetically at him.He nodded at her in understanding.He had no problem being the guy who brought her comfort on her own terms.The guys all piled out groggily and onto their buses, thanking Lenny along the way.Thanks, mama, Blake hugged her shoulders, You made me feel like a man and kicked my ass at the same time.The sun was beginning to set, and there was some discussion of getting a pizza and turning in early.Harrison placed a delivery order and gave Lenny the cash.She walked to the gate of the parking lot to wait for the driver.Famous rock stars couldnt just get their own pizza; she smiled to herself at the thought.They were crazy famous to the whole world, to her they were her family.She sat down on the curb and enjoyed the peaceful calm of the evening.The sky was turning from blue to purple to red with highlights of gold and pink mixed in.She breathed in the clean mountain air and felt the tension in her shoulders ease.She marveled at the strange turn her life had taken in the last month.She had planned on getting as far away from her previous life as possible and now she was feeling the weirdest tingle of homesickness.She missed her family and the open skies of Wyoming.Tomorrow was Davids birthday.She knew they would probably have a big family dinner.Scott and Nathan would be there, as well as Davids wife, Felicity, and their four little boys.Lenny would be the only one absent.She should call to wish him a happy birthday.She pulled out her phone and looked at it.She decided to send a text instead; if they were busy she didnt want to interrupt.Sliding her phone back into her pocket, she was startled when Mike sat down next to her.You shouldnt be out here, she jested, Someone might recognize you.Mike made a humph noise.They sat quietly together for a few minutes, listening to the sounds of the city below them.Lenny leaned back on her arms and kicked her feet out in front of her.I have a confession.Mike looked down at his feet and stirred some loose gravel around with his shoe.Lenny frowned and looked over at him but didn't say anything.I overheard your conversation with Luke last night.Lenny wrinkled her nose in response.And I know that you and Luke, he cleared his throat, slept together on the couch.We didn't  Lenny sat up and started to protest.No, I know, Mike stopped her.You actually slept, not the other thing.Lenny swallowed and waited for him to continue.I just wanted you to know that I haven't told anyone.I know how weird Carl gets about our personal relationships and he doesn't need to know about this.Well, it won't happen again so...Lenny wasn't sure what to say.Embarrassment was beginning to color her cheeks.That's crazy, Lenny.Mike finally looked up from the ground and she was surprised at his serious continence.You work too frickin' hard to have to go without frickin' sleep.If Luke makes you feel like you can relax then I think you should take advantage of it.Mike, that's not exactly...professional.Lenny felt a burning begin in the back of her eyes.Mike rolled his eyes.Would you let it go for a minute?I'm serious about this.His voice held an edge that she had never heard him use before.I know what it's like to run away from something you love because of...mistakes.He licked his bottom lip, looked back at the ground and then back to Lenny.Luke's more than a friend to me.He's a brother.He aided in my recovery like no one else.If he can help you get through this last little bit of disrepair, then let him do it.I just don't...Lenny's throat was dry and her head spun.I know, you're embarrassed.You don't want to need help.You think you can figure this out on your own.Lenny's stomach twisted at Mike's words.When he said out loud what she was thinking internally, it sounded selfish.And weak.I enjoy the whole 'Girl Power' thing as much as any dude but you have to be able to admit when you've taken it too far.A large tear splashed onto Lenny's cheek as Mike continued.Sleep is so important.I can't stress that enough.If Luke can help you regain that part of your physiology then let him.I have a pretty solid theory that once you get back in the habit of sleeping regularly, you'll be able to face the rest of your recovery.But, I've recovered completely, Lenny argued meekly.Sure, physically, Mike nodded and reached towards her, touching her temple softly.What about all the stuff still happening up here?Lenny's vision blurred with tears.Her heart thudded in her ribcage as her head spun, trying to figure out where all of Mike's insight had come from and how she had become so transparent.Did she really appear to be this weepy, broken girl, lost and needing help from strangers?Hey.Mike's voice had lost its confrontation and his hand gently pulled her face up so he could look her in the eye.No one knows.And no one has to know unless you tell them.He studied her face for a moment.The only reason I overheard the whole thing is because figuring you out has become...an obsession for me.He chuckled at his own words.But after hearing the truth, it felt wrong for me to know without you giving me the permission to hold that knowledge...you know?Lenny nodded but didn't reply.Mike's hand dropped from her chin back to his lap.His eyes tugged down on the sides, making him look older than usual.You're a part of the band now, Lenny.Whatever happens from here on out, you need to know that we consider you the sixth member.And you're safe with us.All of us.Tears began to collect in Lenny's eyelashes and she reached up to rub them off her face.Mike had brought out a tangle of emotions in her and she was ashamed at her reaction.She had no words for a reply.Just more tears.She wiped at them angrily.Mike put his arm around her shoulders and she leaned into him.Listen, kid.I get it, I really do.He paused and rubbed her arm tenderly.But you have to go back someday.You cant give up your passions just because of a bad decision.Believe me, what do you think this tour is all about?But Im not like you, Mike, she softly reminded.Youre awesome and Imnot.Mike chuckled at her reasoning.Were a lot more alike than you would think.Youre basically the chick version of me.Lenny sniffed away her tears and laughed.She sat up straight as the pizza delivery guy pulled up at that moment and Lenny paid for the food.As she and Mike walked back to the buses Lenny asked, What happens now?Now?Whatever you want, mama.Well follow your lead, just like always.He winked and Lenny felt relieved.Now Mike and Luke knew.And it didn't seem so terrible anymore.Luke.Every feeling she had in regards to him caused conflict inside.She wanted to be next to him all the time and yet she wanted to run away as fast as possible.He could make her feel completely safe and completely exposed simultaneously.As if Mike were reading her thoughts he said, Luke just wants to help you, you mean a lot to all of us.Try not to freak out about it.She looked over at Mike with a stunned expression and he chuckled at her.Lenny considered his words for a moment, You guys really are best friends, arent you?Mike nodded, Id do anything for him.He saved my life.Hes the only reason Im back on the road again.Mike sucked air in through his nose and frowned, adding weight to his final words.He doesnt give up on the people he loves.I owe him more than I can ever repay.6    Short Skirt/Long Jacket      Luke's breathing was labored.His body hummed with adrenaline and he bent down hard against the guitar strings.Sweat poured off his face and his longish bangs stuck to his forehead.He stilled his mouth behind the microphone and looked out over the throbbing mass of people; his arm hovered over the overworked instrument.He felt a mischievous grin spread across his face as the audience screamed for him to continue.He heard the pulse of Mike on the kick drum behind him.Sway had his back turned to the crowd and he waited for Luke's signal.Harrison stood at rapt attention, a smile beaming across his expressive face as he surveyed the arena.Blake stood solemnly in his zone, guitar half cocked, a statue of rock and roll.Luke laughed into the microphone and the crowd screamed louder.What?He asked them, knowing the reply.Oh, you want us to keep going?The reaction was physical, and the energy coming off the crowd pushed against him.He loved this moment.Holding the crowd on the precipice of complete rock and roll ecstasy.Luke nodded once to Sway and the band exploded in a flourish of lights, smoke, and sound.The crowd erupted with them, filling the stadium with even more madness than a few minutes before.Luke rode the high all way till the end of the show.He was still buzzing as he bounded up the steps of the bus.He flopped on the sofa as Mike threw him a bottle of water.There's never enough.He said to no one in particular.Never enough what?Lenny settled next to him, handing him a towel to wipe off his sweaty face.Luke smiled up at the ceiling.How did she do that?Make him relax in an instant?Never enough time.Or music.Or voice.He took a long drink of the water and sighed.I want to do this everyday for the rest of my life.You and me both, Mike agreed and Luke reached his hand in the air to fist bump his drummer.Luke rolled his head to the side and took in Lenny's fresh appearance.She was in some old jeans and a too big t shirt, her bare feet tucked up underneath her in the corner of the couch.He squinted to get a better look, yep, she was wearing eyeliner tonight.That was new.Made her eyes look even bluer, if that were possible.Her cheeks were flushed a healthy pink and Luke couldn't resist grinning openly at her.She gave a half smile and looked away.He knew he was staring but he didn't care.She was too damn pretty to not look at.Lenny had let him hold her again last night while she slept.On the couch again, but he didn't mind.He'd take what he could get.Two consecutive nights of decent sleep and her complexion had brightened noticeably.Not only that, but her smiles came easier.And Luke loved to see that smile.Is that my shirt?He gestured to the blue tee that was clearly too big for her.Lenny scrunched up her nose.Ha, probably.I used to jack my brother's clothes all the time.I haven't had time to wash anything and I didn't feel like being a dirty girl today.She picked at the hem.I just grabbed one from the back.I hope that's okay.It's fine.It was more than fine, he loved that she was feeling comfortable around them enough to borrow their clothes.And the fact that she had chosen his shirt, whether on purpose or not, gave him a small thrill.He tore his gaze from her and righted himself.If he didn't purpose to move on to the next task he'd stare at her all night.He retrieved his old acoustic guitar from his bunk, the one he'd had since he was in middle school, and took a seat in a chair facing Lenny.He began to explain the construction and shape of it, trying to be more conversational that clinical.He told her about the history of the instrument and what had first inspired him to play.But I read in Rolling Stone that you learned how to play guitar to pick up chicks.Lenny raised an eyebrow.What a tease.Mike let out a large burst of laughter, That's right!I remember when you said that!Luke frowned at the two of them.Of course that's what I told Rolling Stone...they're freaking Rolling Stone Magazine.He shook his head as if to disapprove of their misunderstanding.Lenny's sudden giggle was unexpected and she tried to cover her mouth with her hand when they both looked at her with lifted eyebrows.Luke couldn't help but notice the flush on her cheeks and the nervous way she bit her bottom lip when she looked at him.Luke gave her a wink and continued on with his lesson.He explained chords, notes and calluses while the overhead lights bounced tiny reflections off the guitar and the mirrored ceiling.Mike, for his part, taught Lenny the basics of keeping a beat.He gave her a set of drumsticks and demonstrated how to use her legs to smack out a rhythm.She picked it up quickly and soon they were having an impromptu jam session.As Luke watched Mike and Lenny try to trip each other up he was filled with more appreciation for his drummer than before.Lenny was laughing easily and openly at this point and Luke knew it was due to the cozy atmosphere in the bus.And Mike was responsible for a lot of that.Mike caught Luke's eye and gave a slight nod.He got up and kissed the top of Lenny's head, I have to go to bed or I'll be grumpy tomorrow.Lenny let out a small groan of disappointment but it was halfhearted.Her eyes flicked to Luke's briefly as she said goodnight to the drummer and Luke felt his stomach do a somersault.He wondered when, if ever, she would stop affecting him with a single look.Mike retired to his bunk and Luke crossed over to the sofa and placed the guitar across Lenny's knees.She didn't resist as he guided her fingers to the correct positions, letting his hands linger too long on her soft skin.Yikes, I can see why you have such thick calluses.Lenny winced as she squeezed her fingers around the neck.Youre tough; youll develop some of your own soon enough.Luke could smell her shampoo and it took a fair amount of restraint for him to not lean over and bury his face in her hair.He watched the delicate features of her face as she concentrated on her finger placement.She was learning quickly, just like he had anticipated.I like you in my shirt, he softly murmured in her ear.Lenny stilled her motions.She didnt look at him; instead, she readjusted the guitar on her lap and continued to focus.It really brings out your eyes, he spoke slow, leaning closer to her.He lightly brushed the hair off of her shoulder, exposing her neck.He wondered if her skin tasted as sweet as it smelled.Lenny sighed heavily and her shoulders fell.She pushed the guitar back towards Luke and stood up.Goodnight, Luke.Luke quickly put the guitar down, stood up and grabbed her hand.I dont understand.Where are you going?His eyes searched her pained expression.Im going to bed.You should too.Were both tired and I really dont think youre processing things rationally.She tried to tug her hand out of his grasp but he held on.Len, Im sorry, please dont go yet.I got carried away; I just like being near you.Lenny's face was guarded.When the sexy lead singer of the hottest band in the world starts talking about your eyes, it gets pretty weird.You think Im sexy?Luke tried to joke with her, hoping to get her to stay.Nope.Lenny made a face and yanked her hand away.Were friends, Luke.Dont wreck it just cause you're horny, she snapped.She was hurt.And offended.Luke was desperate to make it right.He wanted to kick himself for being too damn pushy.He thought she was feeling what he had been feeling; he had read the whole situation wrong.And now she was slipping away from him again.He gently grabbed her by her shoulders and waited till she looked him in the eye.Youre right, we are friends.The last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable.He brushed a piece of hair off her face.I realize our situation is...complicated.It's just...he stumbled on his words.Yourethis unstoppable force of nature and sometimesI let myself get carried away when Im around you.Its fine, Lenny replied coolly.Sway explained the rules to me: What happens on the bus, stays on the bus.She pulled back and tried to give a small smile but she looked entirely too sad.Old habits are hard to break...I get it.Luke frowned down at her.Sometimes I dont think you listen to a word I say.I will give you credit, though, she continued, You rock stars sure have a way with words.She started to back towards the bunk area.Well just pretend that this didnt happen and then no one has to feel awkward.She tugged at the hem of the shirt she was wearing.Ill wash this and get it back to you.You can keep it, he waived her words off and tried again.What about you getting some sleep?Can't we still...?He gestured to the couch where he had automatically planned on spending every night holding her until the tour ended.I don't think that's a good idea anymore.Lenny's eyes pulled down on the sides with a deeper sadness than Luke had seen before and he felt like he'd gotten kicked in the stomach.I'll see you in the morning.She turned and disappeared into the center of the bus.Luke slumped back on the sofa, giving up.Not having the strength or mental clarity to convince her she was wrong.He hadn't been trying to take advantage of her, he'd simply gotten caught up in her presence.Caught up in her smile, her laugh, her very being.It had been a long time since a girl had made him feel this crazy.And she had no idea.Not even a clue.He sat in the quiet of the cabin, listening to the hum of the wheels.He picked softly on the guitar, and jotted notes on a sheet of paper hed been carrying in his back pocket.If nothing else, this girl had inspired some of his best writing.He rubbed the scruff on his face.No one, ever, in his life had started a fire like this inside of him.He thought about what might happen when the tour was over and his heart ached at the idea of her disappearing from his life.Lenny lay in the bunk facing the wall with her arms crossed over her middle.She felt like she was tearing apart her insides.She wanted to go to Luke and crash into him.Wrap her arms around him and not let go.But it would ruin everything.It would ruin him.She would ruin him.Every moment she spent with him was intense.It was all she could do to keep her wits about her.Walking away from him had required more mental fortitude than she could have foreseen.If he would have kissed her...She closed her eyes at the idea; that would have been the end of her.She would have came apart completely and she doubted very heavily that she'd be able to survive that kind of a wreck.Different worlds.Different people.Different futures.She would stay away for a few days; they needed to clear their heads.A little time apart and they would be feeling...differently.Three days.That's how long it had been since Lenny had left Luke standing in the cabin on the bus with a broken look on his perfect face.For three days she had successfully avoided seeing him and talking to him.Except for those ninety minutes where DBS took the stage.Then she couldn't take her eyes off him.Couldn't stop imagining what that kiss would have felt like had she let the moment continue.Couldn't stop wanting him to make another attempt.She rubbed her tired face with her fingertips and tried to suppress a yawn.Three days since she'd slept.Yep, it was back to that.She looked at her empty coffee cup and wondered if a fifth refill would be a bad idea.She looked around the small coffee shop, planning on waving down the attendant.She froze when she saw Luke standing in the doorway.Looking directly at her.At first, she thought maybe she had been daydreaming about him so intensely that she had imagined him.But no, he was as real as he'd ever been.Tall, lean, and perfectly created like a work of art.A sculpture come to life.Her fantasy with living breath.She was trapped.She couldn't exit without causing a scene.Of course he's going to come over here, she thought with barely controlled panic as he made his way towards her.He settled into the vacant seat across from her, never breaking eye contact.Hey, she said with a small, sideways smile.Ive missed you, Luke responded and then winced at his own words.Ive been busy.This leg of the tour is prettyintense.His eyes were bluer than normal today.She felt her traitor of a heart speed up at his close proximity.Luke visibly swallowed.He was obviously trying to keep from spooking her again and she felt a stab of guilt.Whats that?He nodded at her notebook.Just some poemsstupid stuff, really.Lenny closed the weathered book and laid her arms on top.Can I see?Luke reached across the table, his fingers touching the edge of her hand and setting her on fire.Lenny hesitated but released it to him stiffly.How much was she supposed to deny him?She was already withholding the friendship she had promised wouldn't get awkward.It wouldn't hurt to let him read some old ramblings of a shattered girl in recovery.Lenny held her breath as he leafed through the pages.She thought a few days apart would cool things off between them.Logically, it should have.She was wrong.Whatever they felt for each other had gained strength.These are really excellent, Lenny.Luke was absorbed in the written words and Lenny was rethinking letting him read her most personal thoughts.Sure, not every single one of them was about her in particular.But she had never really shared them with anyone besides Scott.And that was just because Scott was so damn bossy.No, its just pointlessgirl stuff she trailed off, finding it difficult to have this conversation.Luke looked up at her swiftly, Nothing about you is pointless.Lenny licked her lips nervously.Why did he make her feel like this?She wanted to run away.She glanced at the door, planning her escape.Please dont go.Luke pleaded, reading her thoughts.Her chest burned at his request.I should get back, Carl wants me to She was trying to come up with a plausible lie.Just then, her cell phone rang and she jumped.She hurriedly pulled it out of her pocket and glanced at the call screen.Speak of the devil, it was Carl.She answered it, ignoring Lukes heavy sigh.Hello?Hey, have you seen Luke?He wont pick up my call.Carl sounded irritated.Yeah, hes right here She handed him the phone, thankful for the interruption.Hello?What?Right now?Luke closed his eyes in frustration and brought a hand up to rub his forehead.Yeah, okay.Ill be right there.He hung up the phone and handed it back to Lenny, You shouldnt have answered that.Lukes demeanor had shifted dramatically.What was it about?Lenny wasnt sure she wanted to know based on the clench in his jaw and the narrowing of his eyes at the center of the table.Luke stood up and grabbed her hand pulling her to the door, not worrying about her reaction.Just some garbage I have to deal with, he growled.He tucked her notebook under his arm and pulled her down the street possessively.Gone was the Luke who was trying too hard to not cross any lines.Lenny was thrown off by the sudden alpha male, take charge Luke that was striding purposefully down the sidewalk.She half expected him to toss her over his shoulder if she didn't comply.He didnt release the firm clasp on her hand until they were climbing up into his bus, more agitated than Lenny had ever seen him.As Lennys eyes adjusted to the darkened inside of the lounge she made out the figure of someone sitting on the couch.A tall, leggy, buxom brunette was filing her nails.She had on a severely short skirt and a cleavage baring top.Alarm bells started to go off in Lenny's head when she saw Carl standing a little ways away with his arms crossed.Hey, baby, the boobilicious girl lilted when she saw Luke.She smiled and showed too many teeth, reminding Lenny of the shark from Jaws.Her stunning blue eyes were half lidded, as if in a sleepy, sexy daze.What are you doing here, Ashton?Luke got right to the point.Shes our opener for the next month.Carl said, not hiding his displeasure.The label told me a few hours ago.That doesnt answer why youre here.Luke emphasized On my freaking bus!Lenny was too stunned to say anything.Luke never lost his temper.Ever.And he was beyond livid.She felt like she shouldnt be here except that Luke had brought her.She knew her eyes were wide but she was pretty sure no one was paying attention to her.Aww, baby, I thought youd be happier to see me.Ashton wasnt fazed by Luke's shouting or the angry glares focused on her.Her full, pouty lips made it impossible to look away from her mouth while she spoke.She went on to explain nonchalantly, My band is riding with Sway and them.Im gonna bunk with you.She winked.Lenny almost threw up.She had finally placed who the bimbo was.Ashton James was a recording artist, which was the simple explanation.The more detailed version included her being Lukes ex girlfriend.Their relationship had been very public and fans blamed her for a lot of the problems between the band members two years ago.Including Mikes overdose and following hospitalization.Modern day Yoko.No, Luke said, deadly quiet, You can ride with the crew.Ew.Ashton rolled her eyes and pushed her flawless, chocolate hair back over her bare shoulder on one side.Carl already said it was okay.She didn't even pause her filing and looked at Luke.Itll be just like old times.I never said it was okay, Carl was trying not to rage.You backed me into a corner, you she devil.He turned to explain to Luke who hadnt stopped glowering at Ashton.Her entourage filled the empty spaces of the crew buses and the Red Bus.Your bus is the only one with room until we get to Denver, then the label will have one for her.Whos the groupie?Ashton suddenly narrowed her eyes at Lenny and Lenny immediately felt her body shift into a defensive stance.Shes their assistant.Carl answered automatically, still caught up in his own frustrations.Lenny felt her face start to redden as Ashton looked her up and down with a knowing smirk.She didn't even know this girl and she already hated her.So you guys finally hired a professional to keep you happy?The groupies too inexperienced for you now?Ashton ran her tongue over her teeth and arched an eyebrow.Are you implying that I'm a whore?Lenny bristled, causing Luke to take a step in between the two women.No, I was calling you one outright.Ashton's eyes flared slightly, daring Lenny to react.You're not?Lenny is our personal assistant.Everyone looked up to see Mike standing calmly in the doorway to the back lounge.Ashton rolled her eyes and looked back to her nails.Lenny, Mike addressed without taking his glare off Ashton, You dont do anything she says.He took a few steps across the room and stood in front of Lenny with his back to Ashton.I moved your things for you from the crew bus when I heard Lucifer was joining the tour, youre staying with us.Permanently.I knew it, you're all addicted to blondes.I hope she's at least clean.You had her tested, right?Ashtons voice dripped with disdain.Mike grabbed Lennys shoulders to stop her from charging forward.His jaw clenched visibly and he pushed Lenny towards the door.He looked over his shoulder at Luke who was visibly shaking with anger.Sound check, man.Luke nodded but didnt respond.When they got out into the parking lot, Lenny yelled to expel her frustration, WhatTheHell?!She had never hated anyone instantly before.A few seconds later Carl stormed off the bus grumbling, Never hit a woman!Never hit a woman!Guess Lenny wasn't the only one with self control issues at the moment.Mike kept walking; he motioned for Lenny to join him.She got close enough and he hooked an arm around her neck, pulling her towards the stage area.Don't let her get under your skin.His jaw was working furiously but his voice stayed even.She's gonna say and do all she can to make you want to...well, kill yourself.He snorted and shook his head.No one knows better than me how effectively she can get into your head.Just don't listen to anything she says, okay?Lenny was mad.She was mad because Ashton James shouldn't be anyone to fear.She was mad because this person had hurt Mike in the past.And she was mad that Luke was alone with her.What about the rule?She can't stay on the bus.Lenny was grasping and she knew it.I agree.If I can't have heroin on the bus than the devil sure as hell shouldn't be allowed either.Luke took a deep breath and tried to calm the adrenaline coursing through his body.He paced back and forth across the floor and rubbed the back of his head with his palm.Whats wrong with you?Ashton asked, focused again on her nails.Luke stared at her for a minute, not really believing she was back in his life.Just when things with Lenny wereWere what?I mean really, whats going on with Lenny anyway?Every time I try to make a move of any kind she runs away.Luke shook his head, trying to focus on the present problem sitting in his view.You look good.Ashton eyed him seductively, attempting to change the subject.He heaved out his breath and sat down in a chair across from her.Ashton, look, he began calmly; theyd had this conversation many times.Please try to listen to what Im saying.She raised her eyebrow and gave him a bored expression.This tour is different; there will be no like old times.At all.He tried to decipher her blank look.No drugs, no sex, no wild parties.You understand?Ashton squinted her eyes as she tried to decide which part to argue with and made a face.Ugh, youre boring.She flipped her nail file onto the table and crossed her legs.Any other rules, Headmaster?That was the thing with Ashton, when they were alone together she could almost be reasoned with.If he approached it right.Lenny is our personal assistant, you cant talk to her like that.She deserves respect and she's going to get it.Ashton leaned forward, her eyes glinting with mischief, Why, is she your girlfriend?No.Luke knew that Ashtons jealousy could take a nasty turn if she found out he had actual feelings for Lenny.It would be so much worse than if Ashton believed they were only sleeping together.Then why do you care how I talk to her?Ashton's lip curled in a disbelieving smirk.Shell kick your ass, Ashton.Luke answered honestly.And if you don't tone down the attitude, I'm pretty sure no one will stop her.Aww, you're worried about me?Ashton sat back and pouted like a child.Lukes stomach churned.He couldnt believe he had been with her for so long.He had definitely underestimated how wasted he had kept himself two years ago.Not exactly, Luke grumbled.Luke was late to sound check and completely distracted.But he promised the guys he would be on for the show.Lenny fidgeted nervously in the sound booth, waiting for Ashton to grace the audience with her presence.She hadnt talked to Luke since leaving him on the bus with her.What could she say?Hey, your ex is a piece of work, mind if I smother her in her sleep?Yeah, that's all she could come up with.The lights dimmed and the band started playing a slow ballad.Ashton appeared in the spotlight.Her body seemed to be completely proportionate and Lenny had to wonder how much of that was credit to an experienced surgeon on the west coast.She worked the crowd over and brought them to their feet.By the time her set was done, even Lenny was clapping.That tramp could really sing.It was completely unfair.When it was Double Blind Studys turn to take the stage, they were delayed.Lenny started to chew on her fingernails, wondering what was going on backstage.Greg muttered something into his radio, someone muttered back.He cued the lights and Mike struck the first beat of a very shaky performance.They got stronger as they continued but it wasnt great.Lenny was nervous for them.The guys seemed disconnected from each other.This had never happened before.At least, not on this tour.During the encore, Lenny decided to make her way back to the bus.Her footsteps were heavy as she climbed inside.Ashton, not unexpectedly, was sitting in the lounge reading a Cosmo magazine.Her dark hair hung perfectly down her back, not a strand out of place.Her long, fabulous legs stretched out on the couch in front of her.She was wearing a mens t shirt and lacy panties.That was all.Lenny rolled her eyes and walked past her.Youre not special.Ashtons dig was unexpected and Lenny halted in her tracks.She knew from Mike's warning that she should keep walking but she wanted to see what all the fuss was about.She faced Ashton, taking in her full lips and high cheekbones.Not one thing about this woman was even remotely flawed; and again, Lenny wondered how much of it had been paid for.Her eyelashes were even thick enough that Lenny guessed she probably didn't have to wear much makeup at all.You think they care about you and theyll fight for you.Ashton turned her wicked blue eyes to Lenny.But they wont.I dont need anyone to fight for me.Lenny declared, knowing she was letting Ashton do exactly what Mike had warned her she would do.Ashton laughed mockingly, Youre so clueless.You really think you matter to them, it's actually kind of sweet.She closed her magazine and set it aside.But you don't have anything to offer they can't get somewhere else.You're a simple novelty, a shiny new toy.You're replaceable.Lenny took a step towards her but Luke and Mike came inside at that moment.Ashton jumped up and wrapped her arms around Lukes neck, giving Lenny a great view of her perfect ass.Luke had eye contact with Lenny over Ashton's shoulder.Lenny rolled her eyes in disgust and went to the back lounge.Mike followed close behind.I didnt have any clean pajamas so I borrowed one of your shirts, I hope thats okay.Ashtons sing song voice could be heard throughout the cabin.It made Lenny want to rip her ears off and throw them out the window.I mean, I always used to wear your shirts to bed before Lenny gave Mike a look and pretended to stab herself and bleed out.Mike stifled his laughter.Luke stuck his head the doorway, What are you guys doing?Probably watch a movie.Out there seemed a little, I dont know, Mike acted like he was searching for the right word, whorish for my taste.I heard that!Ashton yelled.Good!Put some pants on!Mike hollered back.Just a couple of days guys and shell be on her own bus.Luke was trying to keep the peace but Lenny couldnt figure out why.Why was he being nice to her?Yep, and I plan on treating her exactly as she deserves until then.Mike stated plainly.Luke let out a heavy sigh through his tired smile.He looked at Lenny apologetically, Im going to bed.He climbed into his bunk and closed the curtain.Ashton whined for a while before she, too, finally went to bed.Lenny half expected her to try to crawl into the same bunk as Luke but she didnt.Thank God for small miracles, Lenny thought.She and Mike stayed up watching classic movies, not speaking.After Humphrey Bogart put Ingrid Bergman on the plane bound for Lisbon, Mike coaxed her into trying to get some sleep.She climbed into her bunk and tried to block out what Ashton had said to her.You think they care for you and theyll fight for you.But they wont.Lenny took that as a threat, Ashton was planning on getting rid of her.Well Ashton James might have gotten her way in the past, but Lenny didnt lose.Ever.It was so on.7    Breakout      Lenny got up the next morning feeling invigorated despite her lack of sleep.She hadnt had a challenge in a long time, and Ashton James just bit off more than she could chew.Lenny was determined to make her choke on it.Ashton's presence on the tour was already oppressive.Lenny could sense it in the mood of the crew.It was like a black cloud hanging over each of them individually, waiting for the inevitable lightning strike.It pissed Lenny off to see that Bitch Face could have that kind of power over the people in her life.Not if I have anything to do with it.She showered and dressed quickly, pulling her hair into a messy bun with a few wisps of hair escaping around her face.She threw on her standard jeans, a snug, canary yellow tee and her trusty Chucks and quickly made her coffee rounds.She greeted Carl in their usual spot with a beaming smile.You look like sunshine this morning, Carl eyed her suspiciously.You didnt kill Ashton by any chance, did you?Not yet.She said with a lopsided grin.That woman makes my skin crawl.Carl took a sip of coffee.Are we sure shes even human?I mean, isnt there a separate classification for pure evil?Carl gave Lenny an amused warning glare.You better steer clear of that little nightmare, Lenny.He said in his worried dad voice.You have no idea how capable I am of handling her.Lenny reassured him.No idea at all.Carl flashed her a look that said he was still unsure but proceeded to change the subject.The good news is that Ive arranged to get hotel rooms for us when we reach Denver.I booked you a nice suite since youll have spent the week in a vipers nest.Thanks, Carl, Lenny smiled sweetly at him.Carl didn't do favors for anyone.Lenny recognized the huge deal that it was and she impulsively threw her arms around him.He stiffened at her sudden embrace and she held back a laugh.That's enough, he growled but Lenny heard the affection in his voice.Her status in this band was solid, Ashton was an idiot.The guys were tense.Mike watched them eat quietly as he sipped his orange juice.Lenny had gathered them up and taken them to breakfast but no one could find Luke...or Ashton.Mike knew the guys were already running through their worst case scenarios in their heads.Ashton had successfully thrown them back into a place of angst and distrust.Everyone except for Lenny.She was irritated but still peppy.Mike watched as she tried to pull the guys out of their glum moods and he again thanked God for her existence.Mike was pissed too.He was doing his best to not entertain his own dark temperament, but it was still there, lingering in the back of his mind.He really hoped Luke wasn't being stupid.He'd been Ashton's lapdog once before.It didn't work out.We need to do something fun.Lenny announced to the table causing the solemn eaters to stare at her.What do you have in mind, mama?Blake finally asked tiredly.I heard there is a bungee jumping area near here, her face lit up with rebellion.I dont know if Carl would go for that.Harrison eyed her suspiciously and Mike sniggered.Lenny was definitely in a wild mood this morning.Who says he has to know?She dared them, eyebrows raised.The looks that went around the table ranged from terrified to excited.Lenny didn't bend the rules.Lenny would never go against Carl.Lenny was predictable.Lenny was safe.This wasn't Lenny...was it?Hell, Im in.Mike was the first to commit; he knew why Lenny was feeling so unruly.Ashtons presence was suffocating and Luke wasnt being himself.He had pretty much gone off alone since Ashton had shown up.And he was also avoiding the rest of the band.Lenny was feeling a need to express her frustration and bungee jumping was a way better alternative than what Mike had come up with...binge drinking and smack.The others turned to Mike, clearly surprised at his easy agreement.Dude, we could die.Harrison felt it necessary to point out the dangers, in case it wasn't obvious.Yeah, but we wont.Mike winked at Lenny and stood up from the table.She joined him at the door where they turned to look at the others who were still gaping.Mike chuckled and grabbed Lenny's hand, tugging her into the sunshine that matched the color of her shirt.Mike looked down at the raging water below him from nearly two hundred feet.This is a very bad idea.He was having second thoughts at Lennys choice of activity for the day.He looked at her getting her harness attached and was amazed at her calm focus.She seemed more relaxed than he had seen her all tour.It shouldnt have made sense, they were easily in the most dangerous scenario he could come up with, and she was acting like it was a trip to the mall, or whatever girls do for relaxation.He had obviously underestimated her drive for extreme adventure.Harrison, Blake and Sway had agreed to try it if Mike and Lenny went first.But Mike could see the apprehension on their faces.Harrison was visibly sweating.He chuckled nervously to himself, what had they gotten themselves into?Lenny approached the edge of the platform and listened to the instructions from the operator.She nodded and took a deep breath.Youre afraid to get on a snowboard again, but this doesnt scare you?Mike tried to reason with her.Lenny flashed him a grin and then dove off the platform.Mike's stomach dropped to his feet as he watched her body fly into the open air.She got to the end of the line and her body rebounded and plunged again, continuing to oscillate up and down until all the energy was dissipated.The operators lowered a rope to her, she attached it to her harness and they hauled her back to the platform.That was awesome!Sway gave her a high five.Are you okay?Harrison asked, his eyes wide, trying to search for any visible injuries.Im great!Lenny responded, Im gonna do it again!Her face was...serene, her cheeks pink from giddiness.Mike shook his head; he knew it was his turn.He would have to follow through since he had given the others such a hard time for being scared.Youre gonna love it, she whispered in his ear as she gave him a quick hug.She stood back, biting her bottom lip and grinning at the same time in anticipation of his jump.Mike approached the edge and took a deep breath.In a moment of courage he took a flying leap and was airborne.The sensations that raced through him were indescribable.He felt completely out of control but totally centered at the same time.Then he experienced a brand new rush in the recoil.His heart was stuck in his throat, but he knew his face had a silly grin plastered across it.As soon as it had started, it was over, and they were pulling him back up.His mighty leap impressed the guys and they got geared up to make their own jumps.Lenny let loose more than all of them, jumping three more times herself before they had to call it a day and head back for sound check.It was weird to not have Luke with them but they still had fun despite his absence.Cant tell Carl, okay guys?Lenny leveled a serious look at all of them.Why does it matter if Carl knows?Were the ones who hired you.Sway said, and Mike noticed Lennys lip twitch at his words.Lets just keep it between us, okay?Lenny said again earnestly and they all nodded in agreement.Luke was late to sound check again, looking like he hadnt slept in days.It was amazing, Ashton had only been a part of the tour for twenty four hours and Luke had aged ten years.His hair was more matted than stylishly messy and his eyes were unfocused and empty.Lenny was helping the guitar techs, Dustin and Ben, get set up when Ashton pranced across the stage  Oh good, Ashton, Blake sounded relieved, Its just you, I thought I heard someone backing over a goat.The guitar techs laughed and Ashton shot daggers at him.Lenny stopped laughing when she saw Luke watching them.He had never looked so lost.Lenny took a step his direction but he minutely shook his head, signaling her to stop.She frowned at his pinched expression, silently asking her question from across the stage.He held eye contact with her for far too long, as if attempting to dump every thought and feeling he had into that one, simple communique.Lenny nodded, understanding as much as she dared.She left the stage in search of Carl.No way Ashton was going to force the alienation of Luke from his friends.Home wrecking sociopath.The show that night was better than the previous, but only marginally.The rest of the band was tight but Luke struggled with playing and remembering all the lyrics.He would look up from the mic and back to the sound booth but Lenny wasnt there.He didnt know where she was and it bothered him.He knew he was the only one at fault for why she had to stay away.Punishment for past sins.Luke trudged to his bus, no autographs or photos with fans.His shoulders pulled down and he felt like shit.He dreaded seeing Ashton.
