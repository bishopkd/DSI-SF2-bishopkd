Manolo, Jess called out, dont worry about the pool house today. The two oclock sun cast a glare off the smooth pool surface that made it hard to see Manolo over by the pool house. Yes, maam, Manolo replied. He turned back from the accessory building, picked up his equipment, and proceeded to vacuum the pool bottom. Nearer to where Jess lay, she could see him better. Uck, Jess thought, I am NOT a maam! Jess pulled at the gauzy wrap that covered her from the waist down. The wrap made her feel overheated on this gorgeous sunny day, but there was no way Jess was going out in the yard without a wrap on. Maam! Clearly, she needed it. Wasnt it was bad enough being a thirty-eight-year-old woman with a boatload of body issues without the pool boy calling her maam? Jess sipped at her Virgin Bloody Mary and tried not to be obvious while watching Manolo work. He wore a cropped tee with the sleeves cut off. The shirt was dirty, stained with sweat and soil. Filthy, slimy, and grimyJess found it sexy as hell. Manolos long days spent in the summer sun, plus his naturally dark skin, gave him the bronze radiance of a Latin god. His short black hair was a blessing there was nothing to block the view of his pronounced cheekbones and chocolaty eyeballs. Manolo had the eyes of a basset hound deep and soulful.  Add in the gym shorts and sandals and ooh lah lahJess wished the pool needed vacuuming more often. Come on. Look over here. Notice me. Nothing more. Just notice me. Thats all I ask. Not much. I want to feel worth noticing. Jesss shades hid the movement of her eyes, or lack thereof, as she watched Manolo manipulate the long pole. Jess was always careful to point her head in a different direction, to avoid detection. Manolo never knew at least Jess hoped so. But someone did. A shadow obscured Jesss sun, and Jess bolted up and spilled tomato juice on her bosom. Anthony! was her first thought, even though it was too soon for him to be home from work, if you could call busting heads work. Was that work? No. Anthony enjoyed busting heads too much for it to be work. Hells knells, Jess heard a familiar female voice say. Tense up much? Oh, thank GodNOT Anthony! Jess finally exhaled, her stomach unknotting. Jess looked up and saw the source of the shadow was her friend and neighbor, Isabella. Despite the hot afternoon sun, Isabella was wearing layer upon layer of black some lace, some cotton and enough beads to buy the isle of Manhattan. Hey, Isabella, Jess said. Just lost in thought. Isabella, popping her ever-present gum, glanced over at Manolo and sat down on the chaise lounge next to Jesss. Lost in thoughts of your tall, dark, and brown pool man, I bet. Isabella grinned that wide goofy grin she sported when she teased. She sported that grin a lot. No, Jess lied, dabbing at the tomato juice on her chest with a paper napkin. You know hes gay, right? Isabella asked. He is not! Jess said. Those muscles, and his strut no! Youre wrong. Then again, he was extremely well groomed for a pool man. Bi, maybe, but not gay. Well, Isabella said, lets ask. Hey, Manolo! Are you? Jess reached out and pinched Isabellas leg. Isabella squealed and said, Are you too hot today? Manolo told her he wasnt and kept at his work. Oh yes he is, Isabella whispered. Jess pinched her again. Youre teasing me, Jess said. Isabella plopped her massive tote bag down on the paver patio and rubbed her thigh. I am teasing you, but he is gay. Stop saying that, Jess said. Isabella had no internal censor. Words like gay came out of her mouth full steam, and not whispered, like they should be. If Anthony heard you The apes not home, is he? Isabella asked, her eyes darting to the house. No, my husband isnt home, Jess replied, and then whispered, but you know how he gets all bashy when a gay person is around. Its not safe to even joke about. Isabella exhaled. Youre married to a caveman, and Im glad hes not here. Id hate to cut into you two lovebirds wooing time. Pffft, Jess said. You know thats not true. It had been years since Jess thought of Anthony and her as lovebirds. And by the time Jess stopped thinking that way, it had probably been years, if ever, that Anthony had thought of them that way. Jess knew Anthony thought of her, when he thought of her at all, as HIS WOMAN nothing more. Isabella is right my husband is a caveman. So whens the last time you two had sex? Isabella asked. Hey! Jess said, so loud that Manolo lifted his head. Dont talk like that. Words like that really! Manolo put his head back to his work. Isabella was too free with words like sex. Jess couldnt remember the last time shed used that word herself. Even then it was probably to do a school assignment. And Jess had graduated high school two decades ago. Sorry, Isabella said, grinning. Whens the last time you guys did the nasty? Bumped uglies? Made the beast with two backs? Danced the sweaty naked tango? Played randy pirate and willing wench? Jess slapped at Isabellas fleshy shoulder. Cut it out! Now, I mean it. Jesss face grew red, but she did start to giggle uncontrollably. Okay, I get it, Isabella said. A long time. Jess pulled off her sunglasses, and her eyes cried out for help. Is it that obvious? Yes. Great, Jess said. What would you say if I told you I could fix all that? Isabella asked, a glint in her eye.        		   -2-  Two days later, Isabella and Jess stood in Jesss garage, looking over Anthonys F350. Jess had no idea what the technical definition of a monster truck was, but Anthonys truck sure seemed to qualify. Like her husband, it was big larger than life. And when the engine roared, just like her husband, it could not be ignored. Jess knew for a fact there were construction workers, men who hauled iron girders by hand, that hunkered down and tried not to do anything that might draw Anthonys attention when they heard his truck rumble their way. Jess could still remember in vivid detail, even though it was years ago, the one time shed seen Anthony tune a guy up. Thats what he called it: tuning a guy up. Jess supposed that went down better than the truth: assault. Anthony wasnt the type of man who felt the necessity of niceties, so Jess assumed the euphemism was for her benefit. Of course, that was back when Anthony used to take Jesss feelings into consideration. Like Jesss ability to be naked with the lights on, those days were long gone. The truck sat in the garage, taking up the whole bay. So how will this work? Jess asked. Simple, Isabella said. My friend installs a circuit board under the dash, completely out of sight, and whenever Anthony plays his trucks radio, no matter what hes listening to, a subliminal message will come out of the speakers along with his station. Who will install it? Your friend? Jess asked, her eyebrows arched. Isabella had lots of friends. Fine, Isabella replied, adopting a faux haughty air. My LOVER. She let that last word linger in the air. God, shes incorrigible. But so free and relaxed. Oooh, Jess squealed. Dont say it like that. You make it even tawdrier, if thats possible. Does Bill know? My husband? Isabella replied. Of course he does. He encourages it. Bill wants me to be happy. Jess spotted Isabellas eyes dart to the floor. Jess poked Isabellas black tee between her low-hanging strands of beads. Wait a minute, Jess said. Youre holding something back. You little fibber-de-libber. Youre holding something back. Maybe, Isabella said. Hey, watch the beads. Jess pulled her finger away and crossed her arms. Isabella Sheffield, tell me your secret right now. Well, gee, Mrs. DAngelo, Isabella said. Im not sure I should. Cmon! Tell me! Fine, Isabella said. I have one of these subliminal circuit boards inside Bills car. An hour each way to work allows for a lot of subconscious programming time. So you know it works. Im certain it works, Isabella said. Look, I know what youre thinking. Isabella fixed Jess with a knowing gaze. Is it just the sex thats dried up, or has Anthonys love for you dried up too? This will out the truth. If its just a rut you guys are in, this will rekindle his passion for you. If not, and its over, youll be able to tell. Youll know for sure. Damn Isabella! She had somehow figured out exactly what was on Jesss mind. Did Anthony not love her any more? Or was this just the natural course of any long relationship? At least Isabella didnt mention Jesss darkest fear was Anthony having an affair? So what will this subconscious programming make him do? Jess asked. Its mild, Isabella said. Itll just make him more oral. Hell talk more? Isabella got a playful glint in her eye. No, silly. Hell want to kiss you more. Jess thought about it for a bit, but not long. Well thatd be nice. What would be the harm? It wasnt like she was violating his privacy or anything. Anthony should want to kiss his wife. Jess nodded her head. Lets do it, she said. It wont take long, will it? Anthony will be back with my Mercedes in about three hours. No, Isabella said. My loverI mean, my friend, will bang this out lickety-split. Shes very good at what she does. Isabella added, with a twinkle of the eye, at everything she does. Your lover is a she? Jess giggled. Youre baaad. You have no idea.        		   -3-  Jess was just ladling the linguini into the cast iron frying pan filled with mussels and clams fully popped, broth at a slow boil, when she heard the garage door open. In moments Anthony came swooping into the room. It wasnt that her husband was in a rushhe swooped into every room he entered. Boots off, dear, Jess reminded. Anthony stepped back to the mudroom and took off his construction boots. Despite being a big man, Anthony bent over with an easy athleticism that a twenty-year-old would envy. A day didnt go by that Anthony didnt hit the gym, and his body showed it. Being big and brutally strong was required in Anthonys line of work, where he regularly had to tune guys up. Jess never asked her husband about his work. Most mafia wives didnt. It was for the best. If you didnt know anything, you couldnt be called to testify. Jess often wondered if Anthonys mafia ties were the source of his impulse to gay-bash. The mafia was not a progressive organization in the least. I hope you got that furniture moved for your friend, Anthony said. I need my truck tomorrow. I drive up in a Mercedes and everyone thinks Im rich, and then they start thinking they dont have to pay me, and that slows me down. Slows you down? Jess asked. Having to remind people that they need to respect me, that takes time, Anthony said. Ah, tuning people up. Jess had only seen Anthony tune someone up once, in all their years of marriage. It was brutal, and it was bloody, and it bothered Jess that she got extremely turned-on watching Anthony use his bare hands to bludgeon that guy, battering him to the ground. What did that say about her? Afterwards, Anthony had smelled so manly, a mixture of sweat and blood not his that Jess had jumped his bones. Of course, that was years ago. Smells good, Anthony said. No kiss, no hug, no how was your day. Isabella was rightJess needed to use that subliminal programming. There was nothing wrong with doing it, was there? Why did it feel like Jess was violating a trust? Her husband lumbered off to the half-bath in the hallway, washed up, and then sat down at the dining room table, waiting for Jess to serve him. Im a scullery maid in my own house. Jess placed the silver serving-bowl heaped high with pasta and seafood in front of her husband. He dug in heartily. Apparently tuning people up built an appetite. Jess picked carefully at her dinner, minimizing the pasta and focusing on the seafood. As she crested towards forty, carbs were not her friend. What do you think about renting a movie tonight? Your pick, Jess said. She knew that would doom her to explosions and car chases, and not the character-driven films that she enjoyed, but one made sacrifices in a relationship. No. Going out, Anthony said. Business. He took half the loaf of Italian bread and slathered it with soft butter. For as long as theyd been married, he could eat like a teenager and not put on any fat. Only muscle. Lots of muscle. Really? Jess asked. On a Wednesday? Yep. Cant be avoided. Jess was left to clear the table and do the dishes while Anthony showered and put on a good suit. He didnt kiss her goodbye. Where have the kisses gone in their marriage? Surely there is nothing wrong with using a little hypnotism to bring back the kisses. But why did it feel wrong? Even when Anthony came home, at past two in the morning, he didnt kiss Jess. She pretended to be asleep while Anthony pulled off his tie and hung up his suit. The bed listed heavily in his direction when he climbed in beside Jess. The cool night air rode up inside her flannel nightshirt as he billowed out the sheets and made himself comfortable. Anthonys meaty hand swallowed Jesss flannel covered shoulder as he leaned forward. Ah, a kiss. What was I worried about? This is a nice change. See, I just should have been patient. Ill tell Isabella to disconnect the subliminal circuit board. Only it wasnt a kiss. Anthony rolled Jess onto her belly, and he climbed on top of her. Anthony yanked up her flannel nightshirt and pushed her knees apart. For all he knew, she was still asleep. Jess stared at the pillowcase blankly, well used to the routine. We need new linens. And maybe a new color of paint on these walls. No kisses. Jess didnt even get a peck on the cheek, or the back of her neckAnthony just entered her, without any foreplay or tenderness. Jess just lay there, patiently. She knew from experience that she would moisten up quickly, and it wouldnt hurt for long. Anthony was a long time coming, just like when it wasnt his first time in a night. Anthonys breath smelled of liquor, and the faint scent drifted of something. Maybe the liquor is slowing him down. He usually finishes pretty quickly. Jess stared at the headboard while Anthony pounded into her. She gritted her teeth. He was big, her husband, and strong. There was no use resisting, and certainly nothing to be attained by saying no, not tonight. Jess just waited for him to finish. What was that smell? Anthony wheezed and grunted as he went about his business. It began to hurt less and less, which was good. Of course, if history was any indication, by the time Jess started enjoying it Anthony would be done, and she would be left to her own devices. Hes my husband. Its my duty. Jess could pick out his musk that wasnt the smell. It was flowery. LikeJasmine. Oh my God! That was another womans perfume. Son of a bitch! Jess squeezed the pillow with her fingers. Yeah, thats right, Anthony muttered drunkenly. Yeah. You cheating stinker. After all Ive done for you! Anthony released himself into Jesss angry body, and then he rolled over and went to sleep. Any doubts as to whether or not Jess should use the subliminal programming became a far, distant memory.        		   -4-  Two weeks later, Jess checked her toenail polish for scuffs as she fastened the straps on her cork-wedge sandals. She wore a button down blouse that revealed a healthy amount of cleavage, for her, and a flouncy print skirt. Her waxed legs were tan from the sun and soft with aloe lotion. Her hair was pulled back. Jess had spent thirty minutes on her makeup. In the kitchen, she finished squeezing the lemons and mixed a cup of sugar in the lemonade. The glass pitcher was sweating with condensation. She placed it, along with two iced glasses, on a bamboo serving-tray. Jess brought the tray out to the patio. Manolo, she called. Take a break. Have some lemonade. I just made it! Manolo smiled at Jess, put down his vacuum pole, and padded over to the umbrella-shaded table. Oh, what a smile. There is no way hes gay. He cant be. Thank you, Mrs. DAngelo, Manolo said. Nice and cold. It took a monster effort of will, but Jess managed to reach out and touch Manolos slick bicep. You work too hard, Manolo. Using the back of his forearm, Manolo wiped sweat and lemonade from his lips. Its very sweet, he said. Too sweet? Im sorry. No, I like it. Manolo smiled. Its very sweet, like you. Jess grew paradoxically flattered and indignant. The last thing I want to be thought of as is sweet! Still, the compliment warmed her heart. Tell him hes sweet too. Tell him! No, not now. Saturday. Manolo, Jess said, would it be possible to pop by Saturday afternoon? Were having a party Sunday, and Id like the pool house and pool to be ship shape. A lie. A little lie. Hell never know. Why should Anthony be the only one to have fun? Jess could have tried to seduce Manolo right then and there, but she needed time to get her courage up. Is no problem, Mrs. DAngelo. I can come by on Saturday. Say something witty and charming. Cmon Jess, say something! Yoo-hoo! Anyone home? Isabella called out. She had let herself in through the gate and was coming around the corner of the house. Jess pulled her hand away from Manolos arm, and Manolo noticed. Isabella was wearing all black again, despite the heat, and she carried her huge tote bag. There you are, she cried. Hi Manolo. My, youre looking fit. Thank you Mrs. Sheffield, Manolo said. Then, looking a bit sheepish, Manolo put down his glass of lemonade and went back to vacuuming the pool. Once he was out of earshot, Isabella said, You never make me fresh lemonade. You dont deserve any, Jess said. Why not? Whats wrong, honey? Jess plopped onto a patio chair and pulled out a tissue. Im not going to cry. Im not going to cry. Itll ruin my makeup. Anthony is cheating on me, Jess sobbed. Isabella leaned forward and hugged Jess. Isabellas bosom was large and soft a place of comfort. Oh, honey, Isabella said. Im so sorry. Are you okay? They stayed that way for a while, and finally Isabella sat back on another patio chair. Ive been so stupid, Jess said. All the signs were there. Why didnt I figure it out sooner? Honey, Isabella said, dont take this the wrong way, but we all figured you condoned it. We? Jess cried. Everyone knows? It seemed obvious to us. Your caveman husband is not the most discrete. Did you really not know? No! Jess blew her nose into her sodden tissue. It was about to fall apart. And your stupid hypnotic circuit board isnt working. Its been two weeks, and he still doesnt kiss me! Isabella stroked her chin, thought for a bit, and then said, Two weeks is long enough. Have you used the trigger? Jess finally looked straight at her friend. Trigger? What trigger? Oh, honey, I surely told you about the trigger. You need to scent the air to smell like lilacs. Hell get oral with you then. He wont be able not to. Jess poured herself some lemonade. Not that she was thirsty, but she needed something to do with her hands. You didnt tell me about the trigger. Isabella looked up at the glaring sun, and then down at Manolos tan shoulders. I thought I did, but anyway, thats what you need to do. Okay, Ill try it. But I dont see the point now, Jess confessed. Isabella rooted around in her tote bag. She pulled out a pocket video camera. It was digital, and needed no tape, so it was very small. Isabella shot some video of Manolo as he worked. What are you doing? Jess asked. Oh, hes so good looking, Isabella replied. I love to record good looking men, even if they are gay. Jess grabbed the video camera from Isabellas hand and put it down on the table. Cut it out. Hes not gay, and I call dibs. Okay, honey, Isabella said. Im sorry. Some habits are hard to break. Speaking of bad habits, why are you going to do with your no-good cheating husband? I know a good divorce lawyer. Divorce? Hah! Mafia wives didnt get divorced. Sure, Mary Barone left her husband, but she had kept a file on Bruno, her husband. Mary Barone had recorded her husband talking about heroine deals and a murder. Anthony never discussed his business. Divorce was not an option. Jess was trapped. No, Jess said. Maybe if I use the lilac trigger, hell mend his ways. How do I know this Love Test works, anyway? If he starts kissing me, does that mean it worked? Isabella shook her head. No, Im afraid not. Hell get oral, if it works, but the gist of my plan is that this will re-spark his interest in you. You know, prime the pump, and hell only be interested in you. If he gets oral but still acts like an ass, then youll know its over. Jess watched Manolo move the vacuum equipment to the deep end of the pool. Manolo moved with a physical grace that Jess found entrancing. It doesnt sound like the best test, if you ask me, Jess said. Sorry honey, Isabella replied. Its the best Ive got. The two friends moved the conversation to chitchat, and spent the afternoon watching Manolo and drinking lemonade. It was obvious, after a while, that Manolo knew he was being watched. Soon after Manolo finished, put his equipment in his truck, and drove away, Isabella left too. When Jess was cleaning up, she noticed Isabellas pocket video recorder was still on the patio table. Jess picked it up, and brought it to her bedroom, where she put it in her lingerie drawer. Then she went out to purchase some lilac scented candles.        		   -5-  Anthony was working late that day, but he had no plans to go out after dinner. Jess set about making his favoriteLinguini Alfredo and also managed to bake a cherry pie. Anthony loved cherry pie. The dining room table had a bouquet of flowers, lilacs and dragons breath, that Jess had bought while she was out getting the candles. Shortly after seven oclock, Anthony came barreling into the kitchen. Once again, Jess had to remind him to take off his construction boots. Every time. He cant break bad habits. This is not going to work. Busy day? Jess asked after they sat down to eat. The usual, Anthony replied, his mouth full of pasta. Whats with the flowers? I just wanted to spruce things up. Remember when you used to buy me flowers? Yeah. That was before we were married. Husbands dont bring their wives flowers. Anthony sniffed at the air. Aha! The trigger! Do I smell cherry pie? Oh, so NOT the trigger! You do, Jess replied, getting up. She knew that was his way of telling her to bring him some cherry pie. That hypno circuit board was a hoax. Or maybe he hasnt been listening to the radio. Was the pool guy here today? Anthony asked. Yes, why? Jess nervously replied. She laid the cherry pie on the table and proceeded to cut Anthony a slice. Her hands shook.  Anthony grabbed her wrist. He comes here a lot, Anthony said. So? Jess whispered. Anthony pulled on Jesss arm and spun her so that she landed on his lap. SO, he should get the job right on the first try. Hed never make it working for me. His thick hand grabbed the back of Jesss neck, and he twisted her head toward his. He knows! He knows I want Manolo! But he didnt. Anthony settled his lips on Jesss, and he gave her a kiss like the ones he used to give her before they were married long, and soulful. When his lips released her, Jess said, Mmm. What was that for? Anthony shrugged and smiled. I dont need an excuse to kiss my woman, do I? Jess used a fork and broke off the tip of the slice of cherry pie, and then fed it to her husband. No you dont, she said. Never.        		   -6-  Jess cleaned up in the kitchen with a spring in her step. Despite his past infidelities, Jess was tickled pink that Anthony had kissed her. It took so little to make her happy, it was a wonder Anthony couldnt manage it without a hypnotic push in the right direction. Anthony was watching baseball in the den by the time Jess was done cleaning up. She sat and watched with him for a while, but things were no different than before. He barely noticed her, and only spoke to her when he needed another beer. I should have put lilacs in the den, too. By the time the eighth inning started, Jess was ready for bed. She went upstairs, lit the three lilac candles shed purchased that day, and changed into a red satin nightie. This will turn his head. It didnt. When Jess went down to the den to tell Anthony she was going to bed, he merely grunted, and gave her a cursory once-over. Jess had hoped the nightie would lure him upstairs before the game was over, but she now knew that was too much to ask. Jess had fallen asleep by the time Anthony came upstairs, but like hundreds of other nights, she woke up when he entered the room. He blew out the candles, muttering something about having to tell her not to leave them burning in the future, brushed his teeth, and took off his clothes. The bed listed when he climbed on. When Anthony put his meaty paw on Jesss shoulder, she thought, here we go again. But he didnt flip her onto her belly like he always did. Anthony eased her gently onto her back, and pressed his lips to her throat. Mmmm, Jess said sleepily. Anthony ran a strong hand, a hand that pummeled people on a daily basis, across her cheek. His touch was gentle. He pressed his lips to hers with an urgency that was a distant memory. Jess kissed her husband back, keeping her eyes closed, and suspecting it was half a dream. His tongue probed her lips, and then sought entry there. Jess opened her mouth slightly, and Anthonys tongue, tasting minty fresh, ran across her teeth. Oh, if this is a dawn of a new era, then sign me up! As Anthonys hand ran along Jesss side, her back arched, and her body reached out for him. She cradled his head in her hands, and Anthony peppered her lips with dozens of tender pecks. He eased his body on top of hers, and Jess spread her legs for him. Anthony kissed the tops of her breasts as his hand stroked between her legs. When he finally entered her, Jess was completely ready for him, and welcomed him wholeheartedly. He continued to kiss her as they made gentle love, and for the first time in their marriage, Jess arrived at the station before he did. It was marvelous. But Anthony wasnt done there. After theyd come apart, at the moment when Anthony would usually roll over and go to sleep, he slid down her body and lifted her nightie so that he could kiss her tummy. Jesss body rolled to and fro on the king-size mattress as his lips danced around her belly button. Ive never been so fond of the scent of lilacs! Anthonys mouth continued working south, and he did something he had once told her he would never do. Hungrily, eagerly, and without reservation, his mouth brought her back to the station once more, and Jess thought she was having the most marvelous dream. My God, hes orally insatiable! Its like hes in a trance! It was a night to remember. The next day, however, was not. After dinner, Anthony went out on business, and saw his girlfriend. Jess didnt bother to light the lilac candles, and when Anthony came home smelling of Jasmine, Jess was glad she hadnt. Anthony had failed the Love Test. Now what? Jess had an idea.        		   -7-  Saturday turned out to be a beautiful day. The sun was shining, and the forecast had no hint of rain. Jess wore her bathing suit, with a wrap around her waist, and sat on the patio drinking iced tea. Manolo arrived, and Jess asked him to clean the interior of the pool house before touching up the pool. Dont blow out the candles, please, Jess said. The pool house was filled with lilac candles, and their scent filled the air. Jess lay back on the chaise lounge and daydreamed about Manolo being as orally fixated with her as Anthony had been the other night. Oh, if only! A shadow blocked the sun, and Jess opened her eyes. Anthony towered over her. Where the fuck is my cellphone? he asked. I had to come back from my rounds. I left it charging in the truck, and when I got to the job site I noticed it wasnt there. Oh, Jess said, sitting up with a start. I used it to make a call. I left it in the pool house. She started to rise. Ill get it. In the pool house? Anthony said. Is the pool man in there? Do you always cavort around dressed like this when the pool man is here? No, Jess lied. Anthony put a hand on Jesss shoulder and pushed her back down. Ill get it. Go put some clothes on, or stay inside for Christs sake. I cant have my woman parading around in front of the pool man dressed like that. Anthony stormed off across the yard to the pool house. Jess went into the house and changed into jeans and a button down shirt. She also grabbed her purse. When she went out to the yard, Anthony was still in the pool house. Jess stole up to the sliding glass door, and took Isabellas miniature video camera out of her purse. Manolo, the pool man, was sitting on the wicker couch that faced the floor-to-ceiling windows in the pool house, with his legs spread. Jess started the video camera, and began recording. The strong scent of lilacs in the pool house had proven too much for Anthony. The hypnotic suggestion had kicked in, and his oral impulse, just as Jess had hoped, must have proven irresistible. Anthonys head bobbed up and down in Manolos lap, and Jess got it all on video. Hell never want his mafia friends to see this. After Manolo reached his climax, he went to stand up, but Anthony pushed him back down and proceeded to have another go. Jess taped that one too, being sure to get Anthonys face. Once she was sure she had enough, Jess walked out to her Mercedes and pulled out of the driveway. Jess used the cars dashboard cellphone to call Isabella. Well, Jess said to Isabella, you were right. Manolo is gay. So it worked? Isabella asked. Jess patted the video recorder on the seat beside her. It worked, she said. Where are you now? Isabella asked. On my way to the divorce lawyer. He agreed to meet me on a Saturday. Isabella wished Jess good luck and congratulated her. After terminating the call, Jess put the video recorder in her lap, to keep it close. She started humming I will survive. Jess was free at last.  THE END  For the Chastity Foelds Blog: click here  For a taste of Mistress Made Me, flip on!

He feared it would ring, yet he wanted it to ring. As he waited for it to ring, hoping it would ring, praying it would ring, his eyes scanned the leaded glass window. Ripples from the raging flames in the fireplace peppered the imperfect glass with bright promises of orange, but that wasnt what engaged Owens sight. He was watching for headlights coming from cars on the road. The rural road was not often travelled. Usually, when a car came down the road, it was coming to the estate where Owen sat waiting in the gatehouse. He was naked, but he was ready at a moments notice to don whatever clothing he was told to put on by the voice at the other end of the phone line. All for Bree. Sweet Bree. My sweet Bree. Owen would do anything for his Bree hed proven that over and over. Soon it would be time to do so again. The phone rang. Owens stomach twisted into a knot. Owen looked down at the table next to his wingback chair. Beside the phone was a stack of business cards. Well, not really business cards, but rather coupons, or redemption tickets. They all said the same thing, scarlet lettering over a glossy black background. Mistress Made Me.  Natural Habitat  Owen sorted envelopes, as he did every weekday, buried in a basement mailroom. Four years on his Bachelors, and two on his MBA, and he was sorting mail in the dank basement of a third-rate office building. Business school didnt prepare him for this economy. And no one told him eighty thousand dollars of debt for a degree from a run of the mill school was not a good investment. He unwrapped his Twinkie and bent to his work, pulling down his sorted piles and placing them in his pushcart. The telltale click clack of Virginia Stiles heels sounded down the concrete hall. Ms. Stiles always wore the most elegant shoes, almost always high-heels, and Owen knew her gait by heart. Owen was an aficionado of womens shoes. He couldnt identify brands, but he knew what he liked. It came from a lifetime spent almost always looking down. Owen could seldom recall the color of a womans eyes, but he would always recognize her shoes. There were two reasons for anyone to come into the basement of the building: to check on the boiler, or to stop by the mailroom. Virginia Stiles would have no reason to check on the boiler. Owen crammed the remaining two-thirds of Twinkie into his mouth and quickly swallowed. Virginia Stiles detested eating on the job, junk food in particular. Virginia Stiles stood in the doorway, her hands on each jamb, taking command of the space like she took command of every space she occupied. Virginia Stiles tapped her toe. Owen, she said. Did my niece get any mail? Owens eyes traced up Virginia Stiles smooth calves, rising along her pencil skirt, and rested upon her trim waist. Hed worked for Virginia Stiles for two years, but still didnt know if she wore glasses or how she styled her bangs. Yes, Ms. Stiles, Owen replied, trying to swallow down the last bit of the Twinkies delicious crme. Yes, she did, Owen said. He surreptitiously wiped away any Twinkie residue that might be on his mouth. Virginia Stiles chuckled. Be a dear and be sure she gets it as soon as possible. I will, Ms. Stiles. Are you happy working here, Owen? At Pure Rile Media? Yes, I am. No, I mean here in the mailroom. Owen swallowed hard, thought twice, and croaked out, Not particularly, Ms. Stiles, no. But Im grateful for the job, and I do what needs doing. Virginia Stiles clucked her tongue. Thats a very good answer Owen. Excellent, in fact. Keep up the good work. Carry on! Owen listened to Virginia Stiles purposeful strides up the corridor, back to the real world. She was only fifteen years or so older than Owen, which put her in her mid-forties, yet she was in charge of this whole company. Must be nice. And a hot body, too. Nice. It wasnt until Owen was sure Virginia Stiles had exited the hallway that he rolled his cart to the service elevator. Logic would have dictated Owen take the elevator to the top floor and work his way down, but Owen hit the button for the third floor. He exited the elevator and rolled his way past the accounting department. He placed a bundle of mail on Allisons desk. Allison was the accounting departments secretary. Hey, Owen, Allison said, half a frosted donut clutched in her pudgy, manicured fingers. A bunch of us are going over to Jigglys after work. Interested? I dont think so, Owen replied. Jigglys was a Hooters-style bar, and the waitresses aggressiveness was intimidating to Owen. Plus, there was the issue of Jigglys signature feature, the Interrogation Room. Aw, cmon, Allison said. Itll be fun. Beer, wings, and laughs. You should come out with us. Without looking up, Owen replied, Maybe. Well see. Owen rolled his cart down the hall. He rolled his cart past the ficus that needed watering, past the water cooler whose very proximity no doubt tortured the ficus, and down to the gray steel door at the end of the hall. He knocked first, waited, and then opened the door. Bree wasnt in the room. Owen picked up the bundle of mail addressed to Bree Estelle. She sure went away a lot on business. Owen guessed that was a perk of being the niece of the boss lots of travel. Sighing, he shut the door. Turning around, he ran right into Virginia Stiles, who had managed to sneak up on him over the heel-muffling industrial carpet. Oh my God, she has the greenest eyes! Owen quickly looked down. Youre fond of my niece, arent you Owen? Excuse me? Its okay. Bree is quite attractive. She gets lots of suitors. Im sorry, Ms. Stiles, Owen sputtered. I didnt mean to be presumptuous. Oh, Owen, Virginia Stiles said as she settled a hand on the front of his collared shirt, dont be ridiculous. Her palm slid down toward his pocket, and she cupped his flabby chest. Bree doesnt like the fatties, though. Just a word of advice. You look like you once were in shape, dear. I used to swim in high school, Owen replied, torn between wanting to wriggle away from Ms. Stiles touch yet not wanting to offend. You should get back to that, Virginia Stiles said. Youd have a better chance of turning Brees head that way. She removed her hand and started to turn away, but then paused and added, The gym on the first floor has a spin-class at five-fifteen. Its free for all employees. Think about it. I have to get home after work, Ms. Stiles, Owen said. But thank you. As you wish, Owen. Ill tell you, thoughBree never misses a spin-class when shes in town. It might be something youd have in common. Virginia Stiles strutted away down the hall. Carry on! she said with a wave of her hand. Bree took spin-class? Sweet Bree. Owen pondered the possibilities as he rolled his cart back up the hall. In his pocket, his cell phone buzzed. Owen took it out and looked at it. His mother. Owen wasnt supposed to answer his phone while delivering the mail, but no one could see him in this hallway. He answered it and whispered a hushed hello. OWEN. WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING? Im not supposed to answer my phone at work Ma. You know that. NOT EVEN WHEN ITS YOUR MOTHER CALLING AND ITS AN EMERGENCY? Whats the matter Ma? I NEED YOU TO PICK UP TWO-PERCENT MILK, A QUART, AND BUTTER AND CIGARETTES ON YOUR WAY HOME. Okay, Ma, Owen said. I will. See you later. DONT FORGET. YOU FORGOT LAST TIME. I wont, Ma, Owen replied. Tucking the phone back in his tight pocket, Owen looked back once more at the gray steel door at the end of the hallway. Sweet Bree. My sweet Bree.
