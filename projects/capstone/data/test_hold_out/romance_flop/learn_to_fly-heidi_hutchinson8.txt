This is where you guys live, I dont.My job is ended.She got a confirmation nod from Carl and continued.But I have had the best time of my life with all of you.She looked at Luke again.He was staring at her with the saddest eyes shed ever seen.I have a whole other life that needs tending to out west.She paused, her mental barrier starting to strain against the heavy emotion that was threatening to overpower her.I will miss all of you, more than you know.The guys hugged her one by one, their heads low.They backed off a little to give Luke and Lenny some space.Lennys resolve was weakening as she looked into Lukes eyes that were starting to turn red from held back tears.I will miss you the most.She offered a small smile.She grabbed both of his hands in hers and whispered, I have never, in my life, felt for anyone what I feel for you.Then why are you going?Lukes voice was hoarse with emotion.Because its time, Lenny whispered.I cant hang around like a fangirl the rest of my life.I have to grow up one of these days.She tried to get him to smile but he wouldnt.Luke suddenly took her in his arms and held her tight.He whispered in her ear, I dont want you to go.This was Lennys moment.She gave him a long embrace and then pulled back, kissed him tenderly on his lips and looked him in the eye.She wanted to make sure he knew she was for real.I love you, Luke Casey.I will always love you.She stepped back and took a shuddering breath.Now, go.She smiled as sincerely as her heart would let her.Be amazing.She allowed herself to behold his masculine perfection one last time, trying to memorize every single striking detail, and then she turned around.He didn't call out to her or chase her.He was letting her go.A tear escaped and splashed onto her cheek.Her legs carried her onward and her heart quaked in her chest.She would feel better in a few days.This was how it had to be.He couldnt face reality, so she had to do it for the both of them.The longer they tried to make it work, the harder it would be to end it.They would each resent each other, making it an ugly end.And Lenny didnt want that.She wanted to remember her time with Luke as the greatest adventure of her life.Because it truly was.17    Drive All Night      Lenny rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and looked around.She had to reorient herself.Where was she?Oh yes, she thought, layover hell.She had flown from Boston to Atlanta and what was supposed to be a ninety minute layover turned into three hours.Then she flew from Atlanta to Salt Lake City where a blizzard greeted her and the other passengers.She had been waiting in the terminal for six hours until they were cleared for flight to Jackson Hole.She sat up in the chair and tried to straighten the kinks in her back.She grimaced as it popped and pulled.Its tough getting older, she thought wryly.Being an adult sucks, she had concluded during her first layover of the trip.Leaving Luke was the most painful thing she had experienced and she still wasnt in a place where she could properly grieve.Surrounded by strangers and airport personnel, she couldnt very well break down into choking heaving sobs, she would cause a panic.She would have to wait till she got home.Home.It was still so far away.She hadnt told anyone she was coming home so no would be expecting her.She figured shed rent a car, drive to the Lodge and crash for a few days until her clock readjusted.Maybe she would just stay in bed for the rest of her life.Yes, that was the new plan.At long last, the call came over the intercom to board her final flight.She shuffled through the line with the other passengers, feeling more raggedy than she had her whole life.Just an hour more.She focused on the next step.As she settled into her seat, the flight attendants reminded them to please turn off their cellphones during takeoff.Lenny glanced at hers painfully.She had left it on, hoping Luke would call.But he hadnt.No one had.Not Harrison or Sway or Mike.No one had called or texted to even check on her.The heaviness in Lennys chest increased substantially as the plane started its taxi down the runway.When they left the airport in Boston it got ugly.Harrison openly wept and Blake was so pissed he threw his luggage at a sign and they had to be escorted from the building.The guys had yelled at Luke.They demanded to know why he had let Lenny walk away.Why didnt he chase her?What was stopping him?Wasnt he supposed to be in love?They were beyond disappointed in their fearless leader.He had no answers for them.Instead he set his jaw and got in a cab and took off.Sway got incredibly emotional and called a girlfriend to come pick him up.Carl shrugged, muttered something about rock stars and got his own cab.Mike was angry.But he was handling it better than Blake, whose face was now a lovely shade of purple.He rubbed his temples in the back of the taxi that he was sharing with Blake and Harrison.Harrison, please stop crying, Mike grit his teeth together.Im sorry, Harrison sniffed pitifully.Its alright, man.Just try to calm down.Mike tried to be understanding.But he didnt understand.What was that bullshit Luke had said about wanting to marry her?Im gonna kick his ass!Blake declared.I dont care if he is Luke freaking Casey.Im gonna knock him out.Get in line, Mike muttered.What the hell are we supposed to do now?Blake asked pointedly.I thought Lenny was a permanent member of this band.Sonofabitch!So did I, Mike said.The cab brought them to their building where they all had their own separate loft in the same massive structure.Luke had bought a large colonial style house in the countryside.Sways living quarters were a small apartment near the TD Garden where he lived in complete anonymity.But Blake, Harrison and Mike had lived in the same building for years.The elevator slowly rose to their floor, Harrison leaning heavily against the steel doors.Lets go get her.He muttered, his breath making a fog on the metal.Blake and Mike exchanged glances but didn't respond.We can go to Wyoming and get her.Tell her it was a misunderstanding.Shell believe us.Well bring her back and Luke will be so happy he His voice trailed off.Hell what?Propose?Mike reacted with more bark than he intended.Right.She tells him she loves him in the airport but thats not enough to ask her to stay.But we forcibly bring her back and suddenly he sees the light?The door to the elevator opened on Blakes floor and they all got out.Harrison hung his head and shuffled along in front of them, stopping at Blake's entry.We have to do something.He said quietly.Yeah, get over her, Mike said sardonically.Blake wrestled with his key before opening the door and going straight for the refrigerator.God bless you, Claudia, he said out loud, pulling a huge chocolate cheesecake out of the fridge and setting it on the counter.Claudia was his housekeeper and she faithfully left a massive dessert in the refrigerator for Blake on the day he returned from a long tour.You guys want to drown your feelings in some serious calories?Blake produced forks and tossed them down.Why not?Mike answered.It was better than going down to the corner and buying a bindle, which he had thought about for maybe a millisecond.Harrison took a bite of the cake and started crying again.We have to get her back, he lamented.How?Blake asked contemptuously, If Luke doesnt want her around what can we do?We can fire Luke and put Lenny in his place.Harrisons eyes lit up at the prospect and it made Mike chuckle.That might work actually.Blake assented with an emphatic nod.Im so pissed at him, I dont want see him for a very long time.Me either.Harrison shook his head in disgust.He pulled out his phone, Im calling her.Nah, man.Her phone is probably off.Just wait a couple days, let her get home first.Mike said reasonably.Okay.Harrison begrudgingly put his phone down.Luke had been driving for a while, he wasnt sure how long.He had gotten home and unloaded his luggage inside his big empty house.The house he had been planning on bringing Lenny to.Then he got his old pick up out of the garage and started to drive.He didnt really have a plan; he just didnt want to be in his house.Not without her.He stopped at a tiny gas station to fill up.It was cold and he pulled his leather jacket tighter around his neck as he waited for the pump to stop.He looked around at his surroundings and decided to buy a map.He spread the map out on the seat next to him and gave it a good look.Pennsylvania.Why did Wyoming have to be so frickin' far away?He started the truck and pulled back out onto the road.Maybe the drive would give him time to think about what he would say to her when he got there.The guys were pissed at him.He knew they blamed him for Lenny leaving.Shouldnt they, though?He didnt want her to leave, that was the last thing he had been expecting.He'd been completely blindsided.But as she broke down the details, the obvious dawned on him.They lived in separate worlds.Goodbye had been inevitable.No, that wasnt right either.She had left because he hadnt explained his plan to her.He had left her out of it.Of course, she had been making plans, too, it seemed and had left him out of it.Why hadnt they been talking to each other about this?Because they were enjoying the moment.Moments.All of them.Sure, he couldve dropped to his knees in baggage claim and proposed right there.But wouldnt that have seemed forced?Especially since he didnt have a ring yet?And what if she had said no?That thought scared him the most.She said she loved him but then she left.She justwalked away.He regretted everything that had happened so far that day.He needed to get away and think.He had to fix this somehow.He had to get to her.Show her that he loved her, not just say it.Lenny didnt know how long shed been sleeping but it still didnt feel like enough.She pulled the covers tighter over her head and cursed the daylight filling her bedroom.She had taken a cab all the way to the Lodge when she had landed in Jackson Hole.It was not a cheap ride but she hadnt called anyone she knew because she didnt want to talk to them.Anyone.She had heard Duke coming and going downstairs but he had never come up to check on her.He had to know she was home, shed left her luggage strewn at the bottom of the stairs.It only added to her self inflicted misery.No one cared about her.She checked her phone again.Still nothing.Lenny angrily pushed the covers off of her and glared at her giant windows letting in all the horrible light.Out of the corner of her eye she saw her luggage stacked neatly in the corner.Obviously Duke had brought them up.That meant he had checked on her after all.Lenny felt worse for thinking harsh thoughts about him.She got out of bed and dragged herself to the bathroom.She stared at her face in the mirror with loathing.She looked terrible.Black mascara smudges all the way to her chin, her eyes were red and puffy from hours of crying into her pillow.Her hair was matted and greasy, she hadnt showered in days.She was wearing an old ratty pair of shorts and Lukes t shirt that she had kept after he said she could.So, this is my life.She thought as she examined her atrocious appearance.No wonder Luke doesnt want me.I look like death.She heard her stomach rumble and frowned.She hadnt eaten in a while, maybe there were some cookies or something stashed in the kitchen.She took the stairs slowly, trying to listen if Duke was home or not.She didnt want to see or talk to anyone right now.She crept into the kitchen and started rummaging through cupboards, finally finding an unopened package of Oreos.She poured herself a glass of milk and shoved a few cookies in her mouth as she headed for the stairs to go back to bed.Hey, she lives!Duke said from behind her.Lenny froze in her tracks.She thought about continuing on upwards without saying anything.But she slowly turned around, swallowing her mouthful of cookies.She was confused at first by Dukes clean shaven face, it took her a moment to adjust.She'd never seen him without a beard and she almost didn't recognize him.You look awful.Duke stated with a serious frown.Thanks, Lenny said forlornly, shoving another cookie in her mouth and wiping some milk dribble off her cheek.I mean, you look like you need a shower.Duke tried again, frown not flinching.Youre not helping, Lenny glowered.What happened to your face?Duke reached up and stroked where his beard used to be.I thought it might be time for a change.It was making me look older.Whatever.Lenny said with no conviction.Sorry.Duke took a step towards her, discomfort all over his face.You wanna talk about it?No.Lenny said and turned to go back to her room.The world is a horrible place and Im going to die alone in my room.She heard Duke stifle a laugh at her response.Maybe you should have something better to eat than cookies.No, Lenny said belligerently.Lenny Duke began nervously, Ithereare some people Id like you to meet.Lenny paused and turned on the third step, staring at Duke dumbly.Theyre gonna be here soon  He tried to speak calmly, looking at her not ready for guests appearance.How soon?Lenny asked.As if on cue, the front doorbell rang and Lennys eyes widened at him.No, Duke.Whoever it is, tell them Im sick or dead or something.But there was no time, a young boy came racing into the kitchen and grabbed Duke around his middle.Hey!Duke greeted the boy and hugged him back briefly.Lenny watched with the eyes of a woman who thought she might be losing her mind.Before she could process the childs presence, a tall, black haired beauty entered the room with an apologetic smile.Sorry, Tyler figured out the door was unlocked.Thats okay.Duke answered her with a smile.What was that in his eyes?Adoration?He was beaming at this stranger in Lennys kitchen as if he had known her for years.And she was looking at him the same way.What is going on?Is the boy Dukes?How long have I been asleep?Am I even here anymore or did I finally die and Im a ghost watching my friends and family move on with their lives?Hi, you must be Lenny.Duke has told me so much about you.The raven haired woman reached her hand out.So they can see me, that rules out ghost.Lenny stepped down into the kitchen, adjusted her milk and cookies into one arm and shook the tall womans hand.She knew she was gaping but she really couldnt stop.She had high cheek bones and the straightest, shiniest, blackest hair Lenny had ever seen.Her scent filled the kitchen, Lenny couldnt place the fragrance but it was warm and intoxicating.Not overpowering, but comforting, like a blanket that Lenny wanted to wrap up in and sleep forever.Lenny, this Natalie Rodgers.Her father was Colonel Henry Clay, she and her son, Tyler, are moving up to the Clay cabin.Duke introduced proudly.Oh, was all Lenny could get out.Duke shifted uncomfortably as he waited for Lenny to say more.He grimaced again at her appearance and she knew this was not her best look.Im sorry for my Lenny looked down at herself, Hideousness, she finished.Natalie gave her a smile as warm as sunshine.Dont apologize, Ive been there.She was so gracious that it caused Lenny to want to fling herself into the womans arms and start sobbing all over again.Are you the girl that can fly?Tyler inquired with wondering eyes.Lenny turned her gaze on the young boy and felt tears start to form in the back of her eyes.I used to be, she choked out.Duke grabbed Tyler around the shoulders and turned him around.Lets go see if we can find a snowboard your size, what do ya say?Okay!Tyler agreed amicably with the distraction.Duke glanced over his shoulder, Nat, can you try to get her to shower or...something?He motioned his head in Lennys direction and Natalie nodded at him.As the guys disappeared into the other room, Lenny continued staring at the gorgeous woman in her kitchen.She studied her openly and shoved another cookie in her mouth.Maybe she was some sort of angel.Or mystical princess.How about we get some real food in you.Natalie said and took away the package of cookies.She removed her coat, hat and gloves, setting them aside.Then she went to the fridge and effortlessly whipped up eggs, sausage and toast presenting it to Lenny who had managed to shuffle to the counter and sit on a stool.She was still staring.Where did you come from?Lenny finally asked as she apathetically shoveled food into her mouth.My car broke down and Shawn towed us into town.Shawn?You call him Shawn?Lenny was incredulous.And weirdly jealous.Duke was hers, she'd never had to share him with anyone before.Well, thats his name, Natalie smiled.Hes always been Duke to me, I guess.Lenny mumbled.Shawn?That was new.This whole thing was new.So, was this woman Dukes girlfriend?She had a different last name than her dad, she was probably married.Was she going to get Duke killed?Are you married?Lenny asked bluntly.Widowed.My husband was a Marine.He died in combat three years ago.Natalie poured Lenny a glass of orange juice.Lenny swallowed hard.Now she felt like a vile wretch.Sorry.Its all right.Natalie leaned across the counter on her elbows and looked Lenny in the eye.Bad break up?She asked with such compassion that Lenny started to cry again.Natalie came around the counter and gently hugged Lenny to her side.Lenny sank against her.She didnt know this woman but she suddenly needed her.Natalie pulled Lenny up and towards the stairs.As they made their way to the top floor, Lenny spilled her heart out.I told him I loved him!I mean, how stupid is that?I just said, hey, I love you, goodbye.He hasnt even called!I know, I know, Im the one who left but I thought they would call.I thought someone would call.Even Shane called!I thought I was important.I guess Im not.Im just aloser!Lenny collapsed on her bed, face down.She twisted her face out of the pillow and continued, And I know it would have never worked.I mean, how could it?He has this whole other incredible life.Of course he didnt want me hanging around forever.I was aflingan experimentconvenient.Her breath caught on the last word.Just like Ashton.Fresh tears pooled in her eyes.Natalie moved to the bathroom and started a hot shower.She came back and helped Lenny into a standing position.Youre not a loser, Natalie spoke firmly.But you really need to get cleaned up.Just because he hasnt called doesnt mean you can forgo basic hygiene.Lenny nodded begrudgingly and began the arduous task of getting showered.She toweled off and Natalie coached Lenny into getting dressed in fresh clothes.Then Natalie sat Lenny down on the bench at the end of her bed and took careful time to comb out Lennys long tangled hair.Why are you being so nice to me?Lenny whispered.Youre important to Shawn.Natalie said simply.And Shawn is important to me.Besides, Ive been through my fair share of break ups, it helps to have a friend.How long have you guys known each other?Lenny was touched at this womans kindness and compassion.Oh, about two weeks.Natalie laughed lightly.I know that seems fast but when youve been through as much as I have, you know what to look for in a person.I used to think I knew what to look for.Lenny said, more tears threatening to spill over.What was wrong with her?Shed never acted this emotional before in her whole life.She was stronger than this.She had to be.She'd forgotten or something.Just because he let you walk away doesnt mean he didnt have feelings for you.Natalie came around to look Lenny in the eyes.Sometimes, guys get scared and they act badly.He hasnt even called.Lenny whispered, folding her hands helplessly in her lap.I know, and he might not.Natalie said honestly.Its important to grieve.Youre not doing anything wrong.But Im acting like a crazy person, Lenny protested.This isnt me!Im always focused and in control and level headedNow Imjust a mess.Natalie touched Lennys chin gently and offered a small smile.Its okay to be messy.Love does that to us.When will I feel better?Lenny asked.Itll take some time.Natalie admitted.But from what Shawn has told me about you, youre strong and courageous.Youll get through this.Ive never been in love before.Lenny mumbled, looking at the floor.It hurts so bad.Like a piece of me is missing.Not something small like a fingermore like a lung.Natalie patted her knee.Yep.I know what that feels like.She swallowed hard.But it will get better.I promise.Lenny looked into Natalies dark eyes and wanted so badly to believe her.She had to hope it would get better.She just wished she didnt have to miss Luke so badly while she was waiting for it to get better.Was that too much to ask?Duke brought Tyler back inside to warm up and found the ladies in the living room sitting by the fire.It brought a special peace over him that he couldnt explain.Theres hot chocolate on the stove, Natalie directed him.Duke filled a cup for both he and Tyler and then they joined them in the other room.Tyler lay down on the floor and took off his socks, propping up his feet to face the fire.Duke sat in the chair adjacent to the couch.Im glad you got cleaned up, he lifted his chin to Lenny, taking in her fresh face and clothes.She was wearing a fuzzy gray sweater that he hadnt seen her in since their trip to Alaska a few years back.She had bought it in a little shop of handmade items.It reminded him of a phone call hed gotten a couple days prior.Yeah, I guess I just didnt know what to do with myselfI still kinda dont.Lenny was blue.Duke frowned.He had really believed that Luke was the one.It had all seemed so clear but hed just let her walk away.What a fool, Duke decided internally.Hey, Nick called the other day.Duke changed the subject.Nick?Lenny frowned quizzically, Nick Federa?Duke nodded, Yup.He and Serge and a few of the guys are heading to Alaska this week.He heard you were back in the game and wanted to know if youd be up for it.His offer hung in the air.The perfect escape.A two week trip to the back country of Alaska with some of the best riders in the world.No television, no distractions.Nothing but the purity and thrill of riding ancient mountains.Are you going?Lenny questioned, a small spark stirring in her blue eyes.Duke sighed and glanced at Natalie.Nah, Im gonna stick around here.Ive been helping Natalie get her cabin in order and I cant very well bail on her now.Youve done enough already, Natalies eyebrows went up.I can get the rest finished.I wouldnt mind if you wanted to go on a trip with your friends.Dukes eyes crinkled at the sides as he smiled at her.I know you wouldnt mind.I think Id miss you guys too much.He stared adoringly at Natalie, forgetting for a moment that Lenny was sitting right there until she cleared her throat in an obvious manner.Anyways, I told Federa I wasnt going but you might be up for it.Duke directed back to Lenny.He knew she didn't have any plans, her future was wide open if she wanted it.All she had set out to do was die in her room under a pile of blankets and cookie crumbs.Yeah, Ill go.She sat up straight.When do I have to get out of here?Duke was a little shocked by her abrupt agreement.Maybe he shouldnt have been.She did have a history of running away when things got tough.Was this another example of that?No, she told Luke goodbye, she didnt just disappear.He knew where she was going and he hadnt called or tried to get a hold of her at all.Going to Alaska on a whim is exactly what the old Lenny would have done.Youd have to fly out tonight.Duke challenged her.Dang, I dont even have time to pack.Lenny showed a small lopsided smile that gave Duke hope.She wasnt gone, she was just hurt.You dont have to impress those idiots, you know.Duke lightly scolded.I know.Lenny stood up, Im gonna call the airline and see if I can even get a ticket.After Lenny had left the room, Duke moved over to sit next to Natalie on the couch.You really think its a good idea for her to do this?He asked her softly.Tyler had fallen fast asleep on the floor.I do, Natalie nodded.Sometimes you have to run away to see is someone if going to chase you.Her dark eyes shined in the firelight and Duke found himself leaning in to kiss her.He paused, considering what this next step would mean.He studied her delicate features and soft lips, savoring the closeness that they were sharing at that moment.Id chase you anywhere.He whispered and then he pressed his lips to hers.This was it, he decided, no more screwing around.This was the ride he'd been waiting on for some time now.18    February Stars      Luke had gotten as far as Ohio before his truck got a flat tire.It wasnt a big deal, he changed it and continued on.Another hundred miles and something under the hood started to smoke.He was basically in the middle of nowhere and it was cold.He slammed his hand against the steering wheel and yelled.He had left town in such a way that he didnt have a car charger for his phone and the battery had died the day before.He hadnt thought, he simply headed west.Luke flipped his hazards on and popped the hood.He stepped out into the bitter wind of the Ohio interstate and tried to figure out what was wrong this time.Hed worked on this truck for years.It had been passed down to him from his grandfather and was one of the only possessions he'd inherited when everyone started dying off.Luke had babied it and had kept it running like a top.But like everything else in this world, it could and would fail on occasion.Maybe it was a sign.Nothing about this trip had been going right.If Lenny wanted to be with him she wouldve stayed, right?Obviously she had gotten whatever she had needed from her stint as a roadie and was ready to return to her real life.I was just collateral damage, he thought cynically.He slammed the hood down on the truck and cranked the motor.It fired right up and Luke yanked the wheel back onto the road.He saw the next exit fast approaching and he took it.Why should he have to drive clear across hell and gone for her?If she wanted to talk to him, she knew where to find him.He pointed the truck east and slammed on the gas.Luke was tired.He was tired from the drive, he was tired of the games, he was just too damn tired of everything.The guys would have to get over it.Just like he would have to get over it.Lenny hadnt been able to get a flight that day but she called Federa and said she would only be a couple of days late.He agreed to pick her up at the airport in Anchorage so she wouldnt have to drive to the interior alone.That gave Lenny an extra day to wash her clothes and pack.It was nice to have something to do keep her mind off of Luke.She tried to stay as busy as possible, even making a few runs with Duke and Tyler.Natalie and Tyler hung around pretty consistently and Lenny could see the bond between them and Duke growing.Whatever feelings of jealousy she had experienced initially had completely disappeared.Duke was a good man and he deserved a good woman.It warmed Lennys heart to know that he wasnt going to be alone anymore.She shoved the last of her socks in the suitcase and paused, Lukes t shirt was neatly folded on the edge of her bed.She bit the inside of her cheek as she considered taking it with her.No one would know who it belonged to, only her.She grabbed it and shoved it under her socks and zipped the suitcase shut.She couldnt have Luke with her, she should at least be able to take a piece of him.Especially since it felt like he had retained rights to a fairly large chunk of her heart.She checked her phone again.It was becoming compulsive.Still no calls or texts.She sat down on the edge of the bed and stared at the screen.Her heart started to beat crazy hard as she typed out Harrison as a recipient.What could it hurt to say, hey?Lenny : Miss you guys, how is everything?She pressed send and set the phone down, hands shaking.Was it too much?Should she cut all ties?What if he didnt respond?Lenny stood up, frustrated with herself for being so weak.Shes the one who decided to end it.This wasnt their fault.The blame landed entirely on her.Her stomach clenched when her phone chirped softly.She grabbed at it, eager to read the reply.Harrison: Miss you too.Luke is a douche bag.We want to come and see you.Lenny smiled.Leave it to Harrison to spill the opinion of the group.She impulsively called him, texting would no longer suffice.Hello?Harrison asked cautiously.Hey, its me, Lenny greeted quietly.Harrison sighed audibly, Did you get my reply?Yeah, but I wanted to call.Lenny tapped her knee with her forefinger.Im glad you called.Ive missed your voice.Blake and Mike arent as nice to me as you.They love you.Lenny admonished with a smile.I knowBut seriously, we were thinking about coming to see you.Well Lenny looked over at her suitcases.Im actually leaving in the morningfor Alaska.The phone was quiet as Harrison processed the information.How long will you be in Alaska?Probably two weeks.Its a trip for some pros and old timers.Just for fun.We live in these cabins with no plumbing and spend all day riding these crazy huge lines.Its pretty awesome.That sounds coolHow about when you get back?Lenny paused.She missed them.A lot.But wouldnt that be like joint custody in a separation?That wasnt fair to Luke, they were his friends first.What was she even doing calling Harrison?She had no right.She was being completely selfish.Maybe.Was all Lenny would commit to.She didnt want to make it harder for her to get over Luke and she didnt want his friends to feel like they had to choose between them.Is it okay if we call you and stuff?Harrison sounded hesitant.Of course, you guys can always call meI might not have great reception in AK but you can leave me messages.She tried to laugh and ease his mind.Has Luke called you?Harrison's voice was guarded.Lenny swallowed hard, No.The line was quiet for a long time, neither of them really knowing what to say.Its okay, Harry.It has to be like this, Lenny said gently.I disagree.Harrison was more serious than Lenny had ever remembered hearing him.Youll seewell stay friends and Luke will move onOne of us had to be the grown up...Lenny tried to pour comfort and belief into her tone even though she didn't feel it.We're gonna come and see you when you get back.Youre part of us now, Lenny.Its not the same without you around.I appreciate that.Lenny smiled into the phone.She meant it.But she knew that given enough time, they would move on too.They would all move on.Duke and Lenny had ridden to the airport in the Bronco quietly and he helped her get her luggage and equipment checked in.She turned to face him, all she had to do was head through security, so this would be goodbye.Duke motioned to a bench off to the side.They sat down next to each other and Duke could see the emotion building on her face.She swallowed hard, pushing back the tears that were already turning her eyes red.Duke took one of her hands and held it both of his own.Goodbyes were never easy but this one seemed more...final than ever before.Im sorry he let you go, he said quietly.Lenny looked away.I cant do this here, Duke, she whispered.Hes a fool, Lenny, Duke continued anyway.He didn't know when he'd see her again and she needed to know these things.Youre going to find someone who makes you as happy as you deserve someday.Huh, Lenny laughed sardonically.You were my backup plan.I thought I'd come home and make a go of it with you but you had to go off and get a girlfriend.Duke shook his head at her flippancy.He knew she was half serious.She was heartbroken enough that she would have sought solace in his arms and he wouldn't have been able to say no.But it wouldn't have been real and it would have ruined both of them.Having Natalie cleared up a lot of his confusion in regards to his feelings for Lenny.It would have never lasted, he said with a tender smile.Thats not true.Lenny put on a brave face even as large tears fell on both cheeks.I couldve been happy with you.I could have cooked and cleaned for you and had your babies.Her voice broke and shuddered as she tried to continue, When I look at you...I see so much of what I want...Duke smiled and held her cheek with his palm.You would never have done that.He touched her tears with his thumb.Youre too good of a person to live a lie.Her body crumpled against him and she sobbed into his coat, I know, I would never be able to love you like you deserve.Duke's heart broke for her.How could he comfort her properly?What could he say to let her know that she was strong enough?That she would heal in time and she didn't need him in order find that out?Its time to be grownups, remember?Duke gently reminded her.We cant keep playing house our whole lives.Youre my best friend.Lenny said through her tears.And youre mine, Duke's chest burned with restrained emotion.But everythings gonna be different now, she whispered.Yeah, Duke nodded.Its gonna be better.He had spent a great deal of his life loving her, knowing the whole while that he wasnt going to be the one to experience her love returned.She was capable of passion like an avalanche, God save the man who would be on the receiving end of it.When Lenny got on the plane, she knew in her heart that Duke was going to be okay...and she would be too, eventually.She was pretty sure that they both knew, without saying, that it was unlikely Lenny would be returning in two weeks.Alaska had a wildness about her that matched a lot of Lennys insides.She would stay among the danger and adventure as long as it took to heal her.Neither of them knew how long that would be.Lenny pulled out her notebook.She hadnt written in it since she first started falling for Luke.But it was time to start chronicling her hearts journey again.She knew more about herself than before.Now, she knew she was capable of love.And she knew it was real.And she knew that if she wasnt careful, it could wreck her completely.She had thought about getting a new one.Her old one had notes and marks in it from Luke and she thought it might be too hard to have to look at that.But, in the end, she decided to keep it.Luke was a part of who she was becoming and she didnt want to ignore that.After all, he was the first man she had ever loved.She wanted to remember that experience as honestly as possible.And honestly, it had been the best thing that had ever happened to her.Luke got home and immediately called a realtor.He decided he hated his house and wanted to sell it.He unpacked his luggage next to the trashcan in the garage.He threw out most of his clothes instead of laundering them.He kept a few irreplaceable things but for the for the most part, it went to the trash.He didnt want anything around that reminded him of her.Luke was going through the last suitcase of clothes when Mike walked into the garage.Luke had been so focused on his task he hadnt noticed Mikes SUV pull up and park outside.Hey, Mike greeted casually.He leaned his long body against the bed of Lukes pickup and stuck his sunglasses in the collar of his shirt.What are you doing here?Luke knew he wasnt being friendly but he really wasnt in the mood for more bullshit.Hadnt talked to you in a few days Mike watched Luke throw more clothes in the trash.I came by the other day, you werent here.Yeah, I was stuck in Ohio.But Im back now, Luke barked.You change your mind?Mike asked, unfazed by Lukes demeanor.No, Mike.She did.Luke looked up at Mike, his face hot with anger.Im not the one who left.Remember?So thats it then?Mikes tone was flat.What do you want me to do?Luke growled.What, Mike!Tell me!Have you tried calling her?Mike asked pointedly.Luke sighed heavily.Shes the one who left.If she wants to talk to me, she can call me.Wow, thats not childish at all, Mike said sarcastically.Maybe you should keep your opinions to yourself, Luke warned darkly.Maybe you should nut up!Mike snapped.You know what?Luke felt his pulse pound in his neck.I'm tired of constantly having to rescue people around me!I'm tired of trying to convince you lot to stick around!It's bullshit!Maybe if you didn't have such a hero complex, you'd see that you're the one who needs to be rescued!From your own arrogant, asinine behavior!Luke narrowed his eyes at his friend.He'd never wanted to punch someone so bad in his life.Stop being a dick!Stop making yourself a victim and look at reality!What did you expect when you got home?She would hang around, like some sort of friggin' groupie?She's so much better than that and she deserves better than that!Mike shook his head in disgust.Nah, man.Youre gonna have to put forth a little effort to get her back.If you want her, go and get her.Luke grit his teeth together.He didnt respond to Mike.Instead, he threw more clothes in the trash.He finally reached the bottom of the suitcase and paused.It was one of Lennys shirts.It mustve gotten mixed up in the rush to pack when they were leaving Europe.Luke touched it hesitantly.I cant make her come back, he said quietly.Heres a random question.Mike was annoyed at how stubborn Luke was being.Did you even tell her you loved her?Luke looked up at Mike, brow furrowed.Mike barked out a laugh of frustration and paced a short distance across the garage and turned back to Luke.Wow, youre really thick, you know that?Mike let his hands slap against his sides in exasperation.And you cant figure out why she left?Hello?!You never gave her a reason!You didnt even tell her you loved her, dumbass!Luke swallowed hard, I didnt have to say it.She knew.What happened to not giving up on people we care about, huh?Mike shouted.What happened to doing everything we could to keep the family together?She's a part of our family now!Why isn't she here, Luke?Mike waved an arm around the garage, amplifying his point.You do love her, don't you?Yes!I love her!But she left, Mike!Luke's face was crimson and the veins in his neck were starting to pulse.So did I once, but you never gave up on me!Mike reminded him.And I did a hell of a lot more shitty things to you than Lenny did.What the hell are you thinking?Luke's posture was rigid but Mike knew him better than that.He was the most broken and defeated he'd ever been.Why was he being so stiff necked about this?I know how you feel.Mike tried to bring his voice to a reasonable decibel, despite his frustration.She's the first woman who ever looked at you and saw past the rock star persona and straight to your soul.You revealed things to her you never would to anyone else.She sees more than the black and white description on Wikipedia and knows every color, shape and flaw that makes up your entire matter.She's still the only think you think about, dream about and want.Mike's voice choked off and he swallowed hard.Luke stared at him, confused and shocked.His face began to pinch as he tried to push down the rising ache that permeated his whole existence.Mike could see it, because he'd been there.Because he was still there.You feel betrayed because when she left, you got sucker punched.Any other girl and I'd tell you to get over it.But she's not any other girl, is she?She's the only one who makes you feel alive.She's the one who stands next to you and makes you feel like this world might not be so bad after all.She's your song, she's your home!Mike was about to say more when Luke cut him off.No, were done here.You can let yourself out.He grabbed the empty suitcase and went into the house, locking the door behind him.Mike rolled his eyes and went back out to his truck.Whatever then.He had tried.If Luke wanted to play the blame game and not fight for the girl of his dreams that was his prerogative.Mike and the guys were still gonna be friends with Lenny and if that made Luke uncomfortable then so be it.Conceited, narcissistic jackass.Luke threw the suitcase across the kitchen floor and stalked into his bedroom.He sat down on the bed and looked at the shirt still in his hands.He picked it up and slowly pressed it to his face.He inhaled her scent deeply.It was the scent that had been haunting his dreams since she had left.He felt a lump rising in his chest and he pushed it down.His eyes began to burn and he closed them.For a moment, she was there with him.Her hair falling on her shoulders and her laugh lighting up his day.Her eyes, so blue they could have been taken straight from the oceans depths, looking at him with love and adoration.Her hands tangled in his, her lips the perfect distance away for a kiss  He sighed and dropped his head with regret.I dont know how to make you come back, Luke whispered to no one.Mikes words rang through his head.But what if she still said no?Luke didn't know if he could handle that kind of kick in the teeth.No, it would take some time apart.He would get over her in a while.She wasnt any different than any other girl hed been with.He held on to that lie, hoping that it would eventually be true.Lenny was in Seattle for her two hour layover before the three hour flight to Anchorage.She had already perused all the little booths and shops in the airport near her gate.She was considering getting a coffee, but wanted to avoid having to use the lavatory on the plane.The airport was packed with travelers and Lenny welcomed the distraction from her thoughts.Lenny?Lenny Evans?A male voice came from behind her.Lenny turned in her chair and stood when she recognized Ben Calloway, a guy she used to snowboard with back in the day.Ben!Lenny greeted happily.Lenny hadnt seen Ben in years.They were the same age and competed in a lot of the same events growing up.His parents moved to San Diego during high school and they didnt see much of each other after that.Ben was immensely talented and Lenny had kept up on his achievements over the years.The last time she saw him, he was a gangly, disproportionate eighteen year old with some serious height in the half pipe.He had most definitely filled out, Lenny observed.He was at least a whole head taller, wide shoulders and muscles that were apparent through his coat.He had the west coast, surfer boy look going, full tan and shaggy hair.What are you doing here?He asked her eagerly.Headed to Valdez for a couple weeks with Federa and them.No shit!Me too!Really?I thought I was gonna be the last to arrive.Nick didnt mention you were coming.Lenny was excited, she hadnt ridden with Calloway in a long time.Yeah, I had to wrap up some stuff at home before I could leave.Its so rad that youre coming.Do you know who else is gonna be there?Lenny questioned.Yeah.Besides Federa and Serge, me, you, Smitty, Shelby Lynn, Travis Jenkins, Shane Brookings and Jimmy Trucker.Lenny made a face at Shanes name.Yeah, I saw all that over the X Games.Ben laughed.I loved how you stuck it to him.That douche bag had it coming for a while.EhIll have to avoid him, I suppose.Lenny said wryly.She wished Nick had told her that Shane was going to be there...oh well.Maybe well have an appropriately timed avalanche during his run.Ben waggled his eyebrows.Thats not funny, Ben.But Lenny was laughing anyway.Man, its so good to see you.His sincerity was obvious.Its been years.You lookreally good.He nodded his head in approval.You too.Lenny smiled in return.Who is Shelby Lynn?The names familiar but Im having a hard time placing her.Shes this little daredevil from Vermont.Shes only seventeen or something but shes blowing up the circuit right now.Ben took a seat across from her and stretched out his long legs in front of him.Oh yeah, I remember seeing something about her.Shes just a kid, I cant believe Nick is taking her along.Cmon, Lenny, Ben chided, We werent much older when Nick took us up to Valdez the first time.Thats true.Lenny rolled her eyes, Man, time flies.True story.Ben agreed shaking his messy hair out of his face.Hey, you still with the rock star?Lenny groaned.Not exactly.It was all anyone talked about after Aspen.He raised an eyebrow at her.Yeah, I noticed.Lenny said dryly remembering the tabloid pictures.What happened?Ben was just making conversation, he didnt know that it was weird for Lenny to talk about.She wrinkled her nose.It just didnt work out.Was he bad in bed?Ben asked suggestively, making Lenny laugh.It just wasnt meant to be, thats all.Lenny hedged wishing she could find a way to get him to drop it without being rude.Was he a jerk?Ben frowned.No, Luke was really great.Lenny pursed her lips.Its still kinda raw for me so if we could not...Ben nodded, understanding.Gotcha.Well, when you get to the phase where you want to trash him unmercifully, I have lots of good ones in my repertoire.Lenny smiled, grateful for his consideration.This trip was going to be fun.Exactly what she needed to help her work through all the turmoil inside.She didnt even mind that much that Shane was going to be there.She felt like she had already kicked that ass and hopefully they could move on like adults.Her mind drifted briefly to Luke.She wondered what he was doing.Who he was doing it with.She blinked hard, forcing the thoughts away and concentrating on the conversation with Ben.No reason to go there.I havent seen Trucker in years, I had no idea he could still ride.Lenny remarked.Hes in the geriatrics league.Ben joked, making Lenny laugh again.Yes, this was going to be an excellent vacation.Luke stared out the window of his bedroom from his back.Sleep wouldnt come.The sky was black, the stars floating in the darkness.He could almost feel her forgetting him.Didnt they have something special?Werent they different from the rest?He knew the longer he waited, the harder it would be to get her back.He felt gutted.Like a car that had been burned up from the inside out.Empty and charred, waiting to be shuffled off the pavement and taken to the junk heap.The fire leaving nothing useful behind.He had sold his house.He had a week to get his things out.He didnt even have anywhere to live.He figured hed place his stuff in storage for now.It didnt matter.Nothing felt like home without her there.19    Deep Inside Of You      Luke suspected that if Lenny knew his suffering, she would feel justified somehow.This is what she wanted, isnt it?For him to be miserable and sleepless and hard to get along with?Well, thats what had happened.Hed been living with Sway for two days now and hated every second of it.As relaxed and unkempt as Sway appeared to the outside world, he was surprisingly strict about his home.To the point of obnoxious perfectionism.A place for everything and everything had a place.And sometimes he would want it put away before Luke was done using it.Forty eight hours into their living arrangement and Luke wanted to kill him.Listen Luke, youre welcome to stay with me until you find your own place.Sway was making his diplomatic speech for the umpteenth time.But you have to pick up after yourself.You didnt hang your towel straight after your shower and I had to fix it.We dont want musty towels, do we?Luke rolled his eyes.You dont give a shit about cleanliness on the road.What gives?Are you just giving me a hard time?Thats Road Sway this is Home Sway.Sway responded like it shouldve made perfect sense to Luke.He walked into the living room and got his coat out of the closet.Where you going?Luke asked.One of the reasons he had asked to stay with Sway was for the distraction.He thought it would be easier to not think about Lenny if he could hang out with some new girls.And Sway was constantly drowning in women.I have some people Im meeting up with.Sway answered casually.You need a wing man?Luke asked.Sway grimaced as his words.Wing man?Dude, were not in college anymore.Besides, Im insulted that you think I would need a wing man.He checked his face in the mirror by the door.He adjusted his long, shiny hair around his shoulders.Sorry, I just thought I could come with you.Maybe hookup with someone.The words sounded strange and forced, even to Luke.Sway turned and frowned at him.Youre looking for a hookup?He shook his head with disappointment.Man, youre not like that.I used to be.Luke protested, feeling his ego getting testy.Youre not that guy anymore.You changed with Lenny   At the mention of her name, Luke looked down and swore under his breath.No one had said anything to him about her since the day Mike had visited him in the garage.It was a touchy subject for all of them.The guys disagreed passionately about Lukes complacency.And Luke was determined to prove them wrong.He was just doing the worst job at it.I know you dont want to talk about her and shit but lets be real for a second.Sway was trying to sound laid back so Luke wouldnt feel threatened but he saw through it.You guys had something real.Ive never had that with anyoneBut seeing you guys together gave me hope that I could have it someday too.What?Are you saying youre done being a dog and youre gonna turn into a respectable human being?Luke knew his words were too harsh but he didnt care.Sway wasnt fazed.He was fine being the one Luke took his hurt feelings out on.Yeah, Im working on it.He paused as he rested his hand on the doorknob.You cant come with me tonight, I have a date.A real one.Actually, Sway was on his third date with the same girl this week.It was totally new for him.He saw the confusion and disbelief in Lukes eyes and took compassion on him, We can hang when I get home, I wont be out too late.He promised.He opened the door and looked at his friend one more time.One of these days Luke was going to have to come to terms with his own hardheadedness.He needed that girl more than he knew.They all did.Luke tried watching TV for a while but there was nothing on.He wondered what Mike was up to.They used to hang out all the time when they were off tour.But Luke didnt want to call him and get another stupid lecture.Mike had no right to tell him how to handle this, he wasnt the one in love with Lenny.Shit.Luke stood up angrily.He was getting so sick of his head leading him back to the same damn train of thought.He didnt want to think about her anymore.It was needless heartache.She was gone and she wasnt coming back.He found himself staring at his phone.Not just his phone, he had already cued up Lennys number and his thumb was hovering over send.He stood still for a long time, debating in his head if he should call her or not.He shoved his phone back in his pocket and got his jacket from the closet.He didnt want to talk to her.What else could she say that she hadnt already said.He didnt need to hurt himself on purpose.He left the apartment and went out into the Boston night.Lenny thought she heard her cellphone ring and took it out to look at it.Nope.She didnt even have a signal.That was weird.She frowned at the display, she was so sure she had heard it ring  Something going on on your phone?Ben asked from beside her.She shook her head and put her phone back.I thought I heard it ring but it didnt.She couldnt shake the feeling that someone was trying to call her.You probably wont get too many calls in Thompson Pass, Nick said from the front seat.Youll have a better signal in Valdez.Lenny just nodded without voicing her thoughts.She looked out the window of the SUV at the frozen landscape.It had been years since she had first laid eyes on the beauty of the Alaskan terrain.Valdez boasted an annual snowfall average of 300 inches with some 600 900 more in the surrounding areas.Which is exactly where they were headed.The stark contrast of the crisp white snow against the brilliant blue of the sky made Lennys heart quicken just a tad.Alaska had always felt like a second home to her.Its great that you could join us this year, Len.Nick was saying from the drivers seat.They were barreling down the highway, trying to beat the oncoming snowfall.It was an easy six hour drive inland from Anchorage as long as weather permitted.Yeah, Lenny agreed, not really listening.All she could think about was how much more amazing this would all be if Luke and the guys were here.Ben frowned thoughtfully at Lenny.She kept drifting in an out of being totally fine to being completely somewhere else.They had been able to talk quite a bit on the plane ride up, getting reacquainted and rebuilding their neglected friendship.Nick couldnt pick them up until morning and they had both opted to just stay the night in the airport rather than get a hotel.It was fun, they spread their coats out on the floor by the heaters and laid head to head.They continued talking and joking until they got too tired and both fell asleep.Ben had been awakened when Lenny had reached above her head and smacked his face for snoring.He never felt like he had ever really gotten to know Lenny completely.She had always been this whirlwind of ambiguity.She wasnt shy but she didnt flirt either.Ben was naturally attracted to her and he was usually very good with women but Lenny treated him more like a kid brother than anything else.He didnt mind, they had the whole trip to get to know each other better.And Ben was looking forward to showing Lenny how much of a kid he wasnt.I thought maybe you and Shelby Lynn could share a cabin.Nick was still talking to Lenny.You know, since youre the only girls.Yeah, that sounds good.Lenny turned her attention back inside the vehicle, her thoughts momentarily put on hold.Unless you want one to yourself, I can try to arrange that , too.Nick put in.No, Ill share.I hate staying alone.You probably wouldnt have to stay alone for long.Ben said under his breath.Lenny frowned at him but he just shook his head like he hadnt said anything at all.She knew what he was implying, but nothing was going to happen there.Ever.She doesnt snore, does she?Lenny raised an eyebrow at Ben.'Cause Ill probably have to smack her.I dont know about the snoring, youll have to let me know.Nick chuckled from the front seat.He glanced in the rear view mirror and saw the brief exchange between Ben and Lenny.He grimaced inwardly.The wonderful thing about having Lenny along was that she was probably the best rider in the group and would be able to teach the others a thing or two.The hard part was that she was too damn pretty and too damn nice.Nick had promised to take over for Duke in looking out for her among all these dudes.But it was going to be difficult.Hopefully they would get enough snowfall that there wouldnt be much downtime for them to get bored and start looking for other forms of entertainment.Especially since Nick knew that Lenny could take care of herself.He didnt want to be taking guys into town for broken bones and what not.Nick Federa was forty years old this year.He had been doing big mountain riding nearly his whole life.Duke had been his best friend and riding partner for most of it.Nick enjoyed nothing more than to get a bunch of pros all together for a couple of weeks a year in what he considered his backyard.He always tried to invite a variety of riders, guys and girls.But usually the girls opted out.The ones that did make it were pretty fearless and would, on occasion, scare the shit out of him completely.This year was no different.The group that had come together consisted of legends and rookies but all freaks in their own right.No one looked forward to snowfall more than this group of crazies.Hows the weather looking for the week?Ben asked Nick.So far so good.But you know as much as I do.That can change.He chuckled to himself.He loved the unpredictability of living in the mountains.How soon till we can get on the heli?Lenny piped in.Damn, youre ready to get to it, arent you?Ben said with appreciation.Oh, probably tomorrow morning, Ill have to check with Jack.Nick answered.Kay.Lenny gave a half smile and looked back out the window.They pulled into the little area where they would camp.Tiny cabins with no plumbing and a couple of nearby outhouses.It was not the most glamorous of setups but no one was there for the amenities.A main Lodge was the focal point of the cul de sac.It had plumbing and a staffed kitchen and full service bar.Thats where the riders would spend most of their down time.It was nice and rustic with an old pool table and a couple of big screens thrown in for entertainment during blizzards.Lenny helped unload her gear and Nick directed her to her cabin.She opened the door to the tiny room and smiled.It had been a long time since she was here.The cabin only held what it needed to.It was one room with one set of bunks and one small window.A short table under the window held a few items that belonged to Shelby Lynn and the heater in the corner was roaring.The bunks were piled with blankets and sleeping bags and a single light bulb hung from the ceiling with a pull string.Lenny set her stuff down and gratefully accepted the top bunk.Shelby Lynns things were obviously claiming the bottom even though Shelby wasnt there herself.Probably in the Lodge.Lenny thought to herself.Smart girl, dont wanna isolate yourself in this world of testosterone.Lenny left her things and trudged through the snow over to the Lodge.She might as well join everyone right away.She had been away from the entire snowboarding culture for so long, she wasnt sure what to expect.Would she have to prove herself all over again?Would they welcome her with open arms the way Ben had?Would she be shunned and rejected?She opened the door to the Lodge and it took a second for her eyes to adjust from the brilliant snow outside to the darker interior.She tried to gauge where she should be as she looked around the open space.It was pretty full since it was a destination restaurant for a lot of folks in Valdez, not just for those staying in the cabins.She took off her coat in the warm interior and hung it on a nearby hook with others.She startled a little when someone came up beside her and put an arm around her shoulders.Were all in the back at the bar.Ben said as he guided her that direction.Lenny was relieved that she wasnt left to fend for herself but she was growing a tad uncomfortable with Bens familiarity with her.She shrugged her shoulders subtly to push his arm away.He didnt resist, instead he walked ahead of her to the group.Hey everyone, look whos here!He announced Lenny to the group of snowboarders who were having a casual drink at the bar.Lenny gave a small wave and swallowed.Here we go, she thought.Serge immediately patted the stool to his left and motioned with his head for her to join him.She smiled gratefully and took a seat.Serge was a legend among legends.He was arguably the greatest rider in the world.His talent and technique were unrivaled.Quiet and soft spoken but he always meant whatever he said.His immediate acceptance of her relieved Lenny.That meant that no one else would have a problem with her either.Serge didnt say much but he bought her a beer and listened to the others talk about their run earlier that day.Lenny relaxed into the conversation.It was fun getting to talk to others who loved what she loved and did what she did.The Lodge was full of activity and soft country music played from a nearby jukebox.It made her heartache seem more bearable.Nick, Smitty, Ben and Shane were playing a game of pool nearby.The rest of the crew was lined up at the bar facing outward.Next to Serge was Jimmy Trucker, a long haired hippy from Wisconsin who hadnt competed in more than ten years.Next to Jimmy was Shelby Lynn, blonde, unruly hair and sweet innocence wrapped in a stick of dynamite.Next to Shelby Lynn was Travis Jenkins, eight teen year old superstar from Washington who thought he was a lot cooler than he actually was.Shelby Lynn and Travis gravitated towards each other naturally because of the age similarity.They had more in common with each other than with the older riders.Smitty was around the same age as Nick.They had been friends for years, competing in the same circuits and then eventually leaving the competitive side for the same reasons.Smitty used to keep his red hair long but had cut it when he turned forty so he would look more respectable.Smitty and Trucker had been along for Lennys first trip to AK six years ago and it was comforting to see familiar faces.And then there was Shane.He kept his eyes focused on the game of pool but they would occasionally flick up to look at Lenny.She wasnt sure how to act with him, they didnt leave things very good in Aspen but maybe they could move past it.He seemed more subdued than his usual, flashy self.You looking forward to getting some heli time tomorrow?Serge asked from beside her.Serge was from Norway but his English was perfect.Lenny could only detect a slight accent if she listened really hard.Yes.Lenny nodded emphatically.How was it today?Good.He gestured to the pool game, Smitty took a bad fall but he says he is okay.He nodded over his shoulder at the rookies.They are a little skittish on the big hills still, he said quietly, his eyes locked with Lennys.I was hoping you would be looking for some good vertical tomorrow.Lenny felt her mouth pull into a half smile.Absolutely.Serge had a reputation for pushing the limits of what was physically possible and Lenny felt privileged that he would include her.
