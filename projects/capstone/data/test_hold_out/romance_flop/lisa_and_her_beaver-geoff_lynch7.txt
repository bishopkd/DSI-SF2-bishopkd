Im a grown woman, I can do whatever I fucking want, Anne replied.Dont listen to him mom, youre coming with us, Lisa said.From what I hear, I dont think Im welcome, Anne said.She has nowhere to go, you have to let her come with us, you cant let her go back to prison, Lisa begged Toby.Toby shook his head and said, Another mouth to feed, great.So its ok?Lisa asked.For now, Toby replied.How far is it to your dam?Anne asked.Im guessing six or seven miles, Toby replied.You will go faster if you get in the river with me.Two hours later, the three of them found Tobys beaver dam and gathered round looking at it.I dont remember it being so small, Toby said.He set his magic box down on the ground.There is no way three of us are living here, Anne said.Good, then get the fuck out, Toby said.Toby!Lisa yelled back, Thats my mother, show her some respect!She isnt my mother, I didnt ask for someone else to take care of, Toby said.Anne, feeling left out, spoke up, Ill make myself useful, Ill go look for something we can eat.You want some help?Lisa asked.Yeah, Anne said.Toby spoke up, No fucking way, if you leave, you will take off, Lisa stays with me, and you can go by yourself.Wait, lets all go together once we figure out how were going to make this dam livable, Lisa said.Toby reached in and pulled on some of the branches trying to look inside the dam.This will take a week just to tear apart and two weeks to rebuild  So what do you want to do?Lisa asked.First thing, we need to find fresh water to drink, Toby said.What about the river water?Lisa asked.If I were a cow or a deer, yeah, but I want something that dont look like someone took a shit in, Toby said.What did you drink when you were a beaver?Anne asked.River water, but thats all I knew, I used to piss in that water, Toby replied.Where do we find clean drinking water?Anne asked.We need to find a farm house with a well, Toby replied.Wont the farmer be a bit pissed that three strangers are drinking from his well?We find some containers, fill them up at night, nobody will find out.Lisa spoke up, Do you know of any farms around here?No, I spent all my time in the river, beavers dont get around on land much.We need to quit talking and get to looking, we cant last long without drinking water, Toby said motioning for the other two to follow him.I hope you know what youre doing, Anne said.Shut the fuck up and follow me, Toby said walking back into the woods.You cant throw a dead chicken around here without hitting a farm.The three walked back into the woods and headed randomly to where the open areas led them keeping track of where they were going.No one had breadcrumbs to leave behind, but they had a general sense of where the river was and could always head back in that direction and from there find Tobys beaver dam.For a half hour they walked through the woods stepping on sticks, rocks and whatever could poke them in the feet.Lisa was getting hurt with every step and noticed her right foot was starting to bleed.I need to stop, Lisa said looking at her feet.Whats wrong?Toby said, We have a long way to go yet.My foot is bleeding, she replied lifting up her foot for Toby to see.Anne spoke up, If youd let her wear clothes this wouldn't be a problem.Toby stepped over to Anne and backhanded her across the face.Dont sass me woman, he said.I might decide to snap your neck right here and leave you to rot.One less mouth to feed.Oh yeah tough guy, still wont fix the problem that Lisa is bleeding and cant go on, you stupid fuck.Toby shook his head in anger.Let me see that, he said getting down on one knee.Lisa raised up her foot and Toby could see a good gash across the front pad of her foot next to her big toe.It was bleeding nonstop but not profusely.A good bandage could help, but no one had one.Fuck, Toby said.What?Lisa asked.You might need stitches, or a good bandage.Anne stepped in close and took a look.This is all your fault, she said.You fucking misogynistic pig.Keeping her naked for your own pleasure.I lived all my life naked lady, this isnt a big deal to me.Then why are you wearing clothes?Anne asked like a bitch.I dont have to answer to you, Toby said dropping Lisas foot and moving closer to Anne.Anne stood her ground and didnt back up.Go for it asshole, she said.Toby cocked his hand back as to punch Anne in the face and hesitated.He looked over to Lisa who was starting to cry and back at Anne.He then put his hand back down.He then grabbed ahold of Annes shirt and tried to tear a piece off.He couldnt.What are you doing?Anne asked.I need to wrap her foot, Toby replied.Anne rolled her eyes and tore a long piece of her shirt from the bottom and handed it to Toby.There you go, she said as snarky as she could.Toby took the cloth and walked back over to Lisa keeping an eye on Anne.He didnt think she was going to run, he wanted to intimidate her.He then got back down on one knee and wrapped Lisas foot the best he could and tied it off.Lisa put her foot down and bared weight on it.Hows that?Toby asked.Then he felt a smack in the head and fell to the ground.Looking up he saw Anne holding a three foot long stick.Asshole, Anne said.What are you doing mom?Lisa asked.Teaching that fucking beaver a lesson, Anne replied.Toby tried to get up but was beat down by repeated strikes from the stick.It was heavy, and very effective.The last strike hit him in the ear and the sting sent Toby straight to the ground holding his head in agony.That had to hurt, Anne said.Youre just going to piss him off!Lisa yelled.He pissed me off, Anne said waiting for Toby to try to get back up.Hes going to get up and kill you.Anne stepped in close and hit Toby a few more times in the head.By now he was bleeding and disoriented.Every time he tried to get up, he flopped back down losing his balance.What did you do?Lisa asked.I hit him in the head a few times pretty well, Anne said.He might be down for good.Now what are we going to do?Lisa asked.Lets get the hell out of here, Anne said.She took Lisa by the hand and left Toby lying in his own blood on the ground.She kept the big stick in her hand.As fast as they could, they walked away from the river deeper into the woods minding Lisas bleeding foot.The woods looked the same in all directions and the further they went, the more lost they felt.All they knew was they had to put some distance between them and Toby.Then they stopped when they heard a noise, a noise like a low humming engine.And then they smelled smoke, not like that of burning wood, but of burning oil.Where is that coming from?Lisa asked.Both stood and listened close.Anne pointed to her left and said, Over there,  Yeah, I think youre right, Lisa said and they two headed off in that direction.More woods and hills until they came to a clearing and saw a backhoe digging a hole along the side of a field.Smoke poured out of the machines exhaust and the motor hummed, only louder.Thank God!Lisa said and took off as fast as she could towards the machine.It was like her foot didnt hurt at all.26   Backhoe      Once Lisa got to the backhoe, she stopped in horror.She recognized the man operating as Paul, the man who captured her and Judd at the photo shoot.He must have been released from jail.She then noticed three bodies lying on the ground waiting to be buried.They made eye contact for a moment and the backhoe stopped.Paul jumped out and ran over to Lisa who was trying her best to run on an injured foot.Paul shoved her to the ground with a thud and came face to face with Anne.What the hell are you doing?Anne yelled at Paul.Mom, watch out!This is the guy who kidnapped me and Judd!Lisa yelled.What are you talking about?Paul spoke up, Your girly here was taking naked pictures on my property.I had every right to lock her up, Paul said.Youre mother forced Judd to jerk off into a cup!Lisa yelled.She forced me too, you dont see me bitching, Paul replied.Where is momma?Lisa asked.Who are you burying?Mama's dead, your asshole friend killed her, Paul replied.Good, she needed to be dead, sadistic bitch, whos on the ground over there?Trespassers, Paul replied.Like you are, again!You cant go around abducting everyone that comes onto your property, there are laws about that kind of stuff.Lisa said.All I know is that I need to dig a wider hole now, I got two more.You arent going to get me twice asshole, Lisa said.Paul knew he left his gun in the cab of the backhoe.He hesitated and looked back, Lisa caught on right away and lunged at Paul grabbing him by his legs.She then shouted, Mom, get his gun!Look in the drivers seat!Anne took off and Paul tried to get away but Lisas grip was too tight.Anne ran to the backhoe, climbed up inside and grabbed Pauls rifle.Back on the ground she ran over and pointed it at Paul and yelled, Dont move!Paul stopped trying to get free and let of Lisa, You know how that works?he asked.Anne pointed the gun over Pauls head and pulled on the trigger, nothing.Paul smiled realizing that Anne had no clue the gun was on safety.He wasnt going to tell her either.With a swift kick of his boot, he pushed Lisa away and stood back up.Whats the problem lady?Dont know how to shoot?Anne turned the gun looking at the stock and trigger guard trying to figure out why the gun didnt work.It all looked like a mess to her and she didnt understand what all the parts did.The gun was useless to her.But she wasnt going to give it back to Paul.Paul stepped in towards Anne, Anne backed up and took off running towards the woods leaving Lisa behind on the ground.Looks like your momma left you, Paul said with a smile.My mom will be back fuck head!Lisa yelled.Im not worried about that.Then an awkward silence as Anne did not return.Paul looked down at Lisa and said, Where is she?Lisa looked over to the woods and saw only trees and grass.She didnt have an answer.Stay there while I run you over, Paul said.He walked back over to the back hoe and crawled into the cab.He put the machine in reverse and looked over his shoulder trying to line up with Lisa who was trying to get up.Once he had his heading, he popped the clutch and backed up hitting her with the shovel blade.That wasnt his intention and it knocked her down allowing the wheels to pass on each side of her.Fuck, Paul said no longer able to see Lisa who was now underneath the machine.Now hed have to get back out and pull her somewhere where he could get a better run at her.But before he could open the door, he saw her taking off to his left towards the house.The backhoe could go about twenty five miles an hour on smooth ground, but this field was plowed with huge ruts that would bog him down.It was time to get back on his feet and run her down.Then Paul heard the crack of a gunshot and turned around.It was Anne standing at the edge of the woods with a man holding a rifle.From the distance, it looked like the man had blood all over his face, but it was a blur as Paul took off running to save his own hide.He no longer cared about Lisa that shot was too close and he didnt want to end up in the hold he had just dug.Did you hit him?Anne asked Toby.I cant see straight, Toby replied.Try again!Anne yelled.You try!Toby yelled, I got the safety off, now its up to you.Anne took the rifle and tried to line it up with Paul who was a good two hundred yards away by now.She squeezed off a shot and missed by a mile.Fuck, Ive never shot a rifle before.She did see that Lisa was safe and that Paul was heading off in a different direction.Together, they walked over to the bodies lying on the ground to see who they were.Neither one recognized them, they looked like      Ten minutes later, Lisa, Anne and Toby were at Pauls house, Toby broke open the back door and they all entered inside.Lisa shuttered as she recalled being held hostage in this house and didnt like the idea of being back.But they had to stay somewhere for now and this was the best they could find.At least there would be food and clean water.Then they heard the doorbell ring.They all looked at each other wondering what to do, then they heard the sound of footsteps from the floor above and a door open.The thought they were thinking was that Paul was in the house answering the door.Toby moved over to the stairs and slowly made his way up to the main floor followed by Anne and Lisa who was holding the rifle.When Toby reached the top of the steps, he peered around the corner and saw Paul talking to the sheriff.Leaning against the wall, out of the sight of the sheriff was another rifle, or a shotgun, Toby didnt know the difference.Whats going on?Lisa asked from the middle of the stairs.Toby put his hand up signaling for her to shut her hole.He was trying to listen in on the conversation between the sheriff and Paul.What he heard told him a whole new story.Paul, were looking for two men and a woman whove been reported missing, the sheriff said to Paul.They were sighted on your road this morning, did you see them?the sheriff Axl Jackson asked.No, I didnt see nobody, Paul replied.Now youre not fucking with me now are you?Youre the kind of redneck fuck that would mess with people like that.I dont think I like your tone sheriff, Paul said.Let me be straight with you Paul, I never liked you, or your sick mother, I would be more than happy if a tornado swept in and took you, her and this whole fucked up farm to hell.Speaking of which, where is your mother?She passed away in a car accident, Paul lied knowing that Judd smashed her face into a countertop.Glad to hear it, how did you escape?You son of a bitch, Paul said.What did we ever do to you?Nothing to me personally, but I know your type, freaks that hide out in your bunkers, think the worlds after you, probably have a statue of Hitler in your living room.Youre making a lot of assumptions sheriff, Paul said.Where do you keep you statue of Hitler then?the sheriff asked.Do you have a warrant?Paul asked.Warrant for what?To be on my property.I dont need a warrant to be on your property, Im just here asking questions, why?Are you hiding something?The image of the three dead bodies in the back field popped into Pauls mind.No, I dont.The sheriff looked at Pauls facial expression and knew he was lying.Pauls arms were crossed and he kept looking at the floor.Mind if I take a look?the sheriff asked.Yes I do, Paul replied.Why?What will I find?Nothing, my momma told me never to let anyone snoop around ever, this is my property, and we paid for it.And its my job as sheriff to uphold the law,  Fucking government asshole, Paul said.He was about ready to go for his gun but decided to play it cool.Im on your side Paul, I dont enforce some of the law, I enforce all the law, if you had a trespasser, and youd call me, right?Then Id come out and take care of that for you.I work for all taxpayers.I take care of my own problems, Paul said.What problems?Did you see those three out here?Did you take care of them?Paul looked at the sheriff and back at the ground, he shuffled in the doorway and shook his head no.I dont know what youre talking about.I didnt see anyone.Dont you listen?I do listen, and what I hear makes me think youre hiding something.I think Ill contact the judge about getting a search warrant and checking out your property, the sheriff said.Under what cause?You cant just make shit up!You are very evasive, that is probable cause in my book, and I think the judge will agree with me.Just because I dont allow you to search my property?This is America, I have rights!Paul snapped back.So do those three missing people, they have the right to be found.I think you know where they are, I think you might be holding them, the sheriff said.He put his hand close to his sidearm.Do what you want sheriff, Paul said sternly.Nobodys coming on my property period.From behind Paul, the sheriff saw a figure move.Spooked, the sheriff took out his pistol and pointed it at the man standing behind Paul.Who is that?the sheriff asked.Paul turned around to see Toby standing behind him.In a panic, Paul reached for his gun, but before he could get to it, Toby pushed Paul out the door and into the sheriff.Toby grabbed the gun and tossed it back further into the room away from Pauls reach.Anne and Lisa came up behind Toby and Lisa handed him the rifle.Grab that gun, Toby said looking over to where he tossed it.Then the sound of gunshots cracked from outside and Toby looked to see the sheriff shooting from the porch.It looked like Paul took off running and the sheriff was trying to mow him down.The sheriff then turned to Toby, pistol in hand and yelled, Put down the gun!Toby dropped the rifle on the ground and put his hands up.Get out here on the porch!All of you!the sheriff yelled.Toby and the two women walked out onto the porch.On the ground, face down, hands behind your back!the sheriff yelled.The three complied and the sheriff called for backup on his radio.Who the fuck are you?the sheriff asked.Im looking for two men and one woman, not one man and two women.I know who youre looking for!Anne yelled.He killed them, they are in the field.He was going to bury them.That fuck wad!the sheriff yelled in an adrenaline fueled panic.Who are you?Anne didnt want to say anything, she was a fugitive and talking to the sheriff would land her right back in prison.But she was fucked anyway.Anne Marie, she said.Anne?I didnt recognize you without your uniform on and your tit hanging out, the sheriff said.Toby said his name and then Lisa.The sheriff knew Lisa, she was the girl he was looking for way back when he entered the diner.Why are you naked?the sheriff asked Lisa.Are you still taking porn pictures out in the country?No, I didnt get a chance too, that fuck kidnapped me and Judd.What kind of whore are you?the sheriff asked.I know your momma is gutter trash, but I thought maybe her kids would be different.Fuck you, Lisa said.Sorry, I dont have fifty bucks, the sheriff replied.27   Booby trap      The smell of smoke filled the air and pops and bangs could be heard from behind the house.The sheriff knew something was up and backed off the porch keeping his pistol pointed at the three laying on their faces.Whats going on?Anne asked in a panic.Get up!the sheriff yelled, Get away from the house now!The three stood up and took off down the steps tripping over each other to get away from what seemed like a burning house.The smoke now poured out the front door and more popping sounds could be heard.Then a crack of a rifle and Anne hit the ground.There was no time to stop, the house was now burning with flames shooting out of the windows and holes that seemed to burst from the roof.Its booby trapped!the sheriff yelled.The house has bombs in it, get back to the road!he yelled.Toby stopped and kneeled down to check on Anne, she had a gunshot to the side of her head that trickled a small amount of blood onto the ground.She was motionless and looking vacantly at the open field.Toby knew Paul was going to pick them off one by one.Lisa ran to the road and looked back wondering why nobody followed her, then she saw her mother lying on the ground with Toby running from her.Whats wrong with mom?she yelled.Shes been shot!Get to the sheriffs truck and get inside!Toby yelled.More shots from the rifle cracked in the air and the smoke was thick like paint.Neither Toby nor Lisa could see where the sheriff was and felt like sitting ducks, but the metal of the cab gave them some sense of relief, although a high power rifle round would slice through the cab like it wasnt there.We have to get the fuck out of here!Lisa yelled.Toby looked at the ignition and saw no keys.He has the keys, we cant go anywhere, he replied.Find the sheriff, get the keys!she yelled.Then she heard the sound of glass breaking and saw a spot in the windshield where a bullet passed through.Then another.She huddled down into her seat and waited for the next shot.Toby didnt want to wait, he got out of the truck and ran back to where he had last seen the sheriff.Lying on the ground, with one shot to the chest, Sheriff Axl Jackson lie wounded.Help me!the sheriff pleaded.Give me your keys, Toby said holding out his hand.Ill get help.I called for backup already, get me away from here, the sheriff said.Toby had no intention of dragging the sheriff across the ground leaving himself exposed.All he wanted was his keys, so he bent down and dug through his pockets.What are you doing?the sheriff asked pushing Toby away.Toby placed his knee on the sheriffs arm, keeping him from grabbing him and found his keys in his right pants pocket.Once he had them, he stood up and ran back to the truck.Then he heard a rifle crack and expected to be hit, but nothing.The shot motivated him more and he sprinted back to the truck where he found Lisa lying with a bullet wound to her right shoulder.Are you alright?Toby asked.Lisa leaned up in her seat and said, Did you get the keys?Yes.Get us the fuck out of here!she yelled and laid back down.Toby started the truck and pulled away leaving the burning house behind him.In the distance he could hear the sounds of sirens and knew help was on the way, but now he was driving a stolen sheriffs vehicle and left a wounded man behind to die.As soon as the first turn came up, Toby made a right and sped off away from town so he wouldnt cross paths with the emergency vehicles responding to the sheriffs call.Where are you going?Lisa asked.Anywhere but back to town, we need to get back to my beaver dam, Toby replied.I need to get to a hospital!I just left a man to die, Im not going to run to town so they can lock me up.Toby looked at Lisas wound.Youre not bleeding that bad, youll live.I cant live with a bullet in me, itll get infected, Lisa plead.Toby continued down the road in the direction of the river.Once there he could abandon the truck and follow the river back home.Did you hear me?Toby slammed on the breaks and stopped the truck on the gravel road.Get out!he yelled.Lisa didnt move.If you want to go so bad, get out now!Why cant you take me?I told you, you stupid bitch, now get out of shut the fuck up.Make up your mind because Im going in ten seconds.Lisa looked at Toby and grit her teeth, she was pissed but she wasnt about to walk back to the house.Or was she?She decided it was best to leave and get help so she grabbed the door handle and before she could move it, Toby took off spinning his tires heading back down the gravel road.What are you doing?she asked.I didnt think youd go, Toby replied.Stop the truck now!Toby ignored Lisa and continued down the road at a speed way too fast for the conditions.Hills and gravel out in the country can spell disaster.Four hours later, Toby and Lisa were back at the beaver dam.They had abandon the truck at the bridge and waded down the river.Lisa made sure she kept her open wound from touching the filthy river water.At the dam, Lisa sat on the bank while Toby found his magic box.What are you doing with that?she asked.This thing has power, I need to figure out how to use it, Toby replied.Its just a box with a dead baby inside, its not magic.Toby pulled the skull out and held it in his hand.He examined the face and turned it around looking for anything unusual.It was small, but not misshapen or odd in anyway.He poured the rest of the bones into the lid making sure he didnt spill any on the ground.The business card was still there, but otherwise there was nothing else.Fuck, he said shaking his head.Whats on the bottom of the box?Lisa said.She could see the bottom when Toby set the box on the ground.Toby picked up the box and saw writing.It was one sentence in the form of a riddle.To unlock my power, name three things that have eyes yet cannot see, he read aloud.A needle, Lisa said.What else?Toby asked.Potatoes have eyes, Lisa replied.I need one more.Both Toby and Lisa sat on the river bank racking their brains trying to think of a third answer.Neither one could think of anything.A blind person?Toby asked.He was sure he was right and waited for the power of the box to be unleashed, but nothing.Thats a valid answer, he said.Obviously the box disagrees, Lisa replied.I dont think the question is about literal eyes, it has to be something that is called an eye.Im hungry, Toby said.We need to find some food and water, fuck, were right back where we started from, without your mother of course.Yeah, thanks for bringing that up, Im sure youre glad shes gone, one less mouth to feed, Lisa said.Hey, I didnt kill her, that crazy farmer fuck did.Hey that reminds me, I wonder if he had a water jug or some food in that backhoe.Probably full of chewing tobacco if there is, Lisa said.Better than dying of dehydration.Im in no mood to walk back to the farmhouse and see those dead bodies on the ground.Plus, hes still on the loose.Toby leaned back on his hands and looked up at the late afternoon sky.Gonna be dark soon, he said.Looks like it might storm.Lisa did one of those double takes like a chicken cocking its head.Did you say storm?Yeah, why?Thats the answer, a storm.Storms have eyes, Lisa said.Toby sad back up and picked up the box.He dumped the skeleton back in the box and put the lid back on.Let me try this.Box, the answer to your riddle is needle, potato and storm.He waited for the magic and again nothing happened.Pissed, he put the box back down and crossed his arms, but before he could get too far, Lisa noticed something.Look at your hand, She said.The one that was holding the box.Toby looked at his hand and saw long hairs sticking out, long hairs like he had when he was a beaver.What the hell?he said looking at his hand.Whats going on?he asked.Youre turning back into a beaver, Lisa said.Its running down your arm now.Toby watched as his arm transformed from human into beaver, hairs grew and his arm grew smaller.With every second he became less human and more a wood eating water based rodent.No, I liked be human, I dont want to change back, he said to his dismay.In less than five minutes, Toby was totally transformed back into a furry little beaver with two buck teeth for cutting wood.The clothes he was wearing were now laying on the ground next to him.He was in shock and pissed as hell.Are you alright?Lisa asked.Im fine, just very disappointed, Toby replied.He looked over at Lisa and saw that her wound was gone, not healed, gone.Look at your shoulder, he said.Lisa looked at where the bullet hit and saw there wound was gone.Im healed!The magic box worked!Then they heard a familiar voice reply from the edge of the woods, Thought you could get away?Paul said.Both Toby and Lisa looked over and saw Paul standing at the edge of the woods holding a rifle.Wheres your friend?Paul asked.Lisa looked at Toby and back to Paul.He left me, ran off, she replied.Chicken shit, Paul said.Whose clothes are those?he asked.I dont know, there were here when I got here, Lisa replied.Paul raised his rifle and pointed it at Toby, Looks like I have lunch figured out, and took a shot missing Toby by inches.Toby scurried as fast as he could to the river bank and dove in as Paul took two more shots that missed.Fuck, my sights need adjustment bad, he said.For what seemed a long moment, both Paul and Lisa had an awkward silence as neither knew what to say to the other.They didnt think theyd see each other again.Then Lisa spoke up.Now what?she asked.Dont know, need to think about it for a while, the sheriffs deputies and the state patrol are out looking for me, so I cant stay too long, but maybe I rape the shit out of you for the fun of it.Lisa crossed her arms and legs giving Paul the idea she was off limits and wasnt going to let him have his way easy.How are you going to do that holding the rifle?Do you think Im going to let you rape me willingly?I could put a few holes in you first, make it hard to fight back, then when Im done, shoot you in the head and toss you in the river, Paul replied.What a pathetic fuck, Lisa said.Yeah, you run around naked all the time, you must be some sort of whore anyway, I bet you like getting fucked all the time, Paul said.Are you saying Im asking for it because of how I look?A whore is a whore, just like your momma, Paul replied.28   Bacon      Paul stepped over to Lisa and stood above her with his rifle pointed at her foot.Couple in the leg should keep you from getting away, he said.But before he could pull off a shot, Lisa grabbed the magic box and threw it at Paul.It hit him and fell to the ground intact.What was that?he asked laughing.Was that supposed to hurt?Lisa was disappointed, she expected the box to do something to Paul, but he continued to stand over her with the rifle.She reached over and picked up the box and turned it over to the bottom to read the riddle again.This time it had changed.Now it asked, What is black and white and red all over, She replied out loud, A sunburn penguin, and tossed the box at Paul.He immediately caught fire and began to burn to a crisp while Lisa watched.In less than thirty seconds Paul was an ash on the ground with a rifle laying near.Nice, Toby said from the river.His head was above water watching what was going on.Lisa turned to Toby and stood up.She walked over to the river and stood with her hands on her hips like she was about to explode.I am so sick of this shit!I just want to go home and have a normal life, she said.Sorry honey, you can head back whenever you want, Im a beaver again and I can live here like I used to.No!You are going to help me!Im twenty miles from home, still naked, and starving.I havent had a shower in days, or a drink of water and Im about to pass out of sheer exhaustion.There are a shitload of cops out there looking for the asshole you just torched.Go find one, theyll take you home, Toby said.And you can put on my clothes, I dont need them anymore.Lisa looked at the shirt and pants lying on the ground.They were way too big and filthy, by now she was used to running around with no clothes on and the idea of wearing Tobys old shirt and pants grossed her out.No thanks, she said and stepped into the river.Its gonna be dark soon, you need a place to sleep, Toby said.Can I fit in there?she asked looking at the beaver dam.No, youll have to sleep on the bank, it gets pretty cold out at night.You better find something to cover up with.What I need is a fire, Lisa said.And every cop will be here, if thats what you want.I dont know if thats what I want or not, she replied.On one hand I want to go back, but I know once I do my life will be on display, probably have reporters and cops bothering me constantly.You wanted to be a star right?This all started when you were going for a photo shoot.Why not milk it?Use the publicity.Lisa thought Toby may be onto something, but there was one problem.I never got any pictures taken, I have nothing to publicize.You can shoot pictures afterwards, Toby said.By then nobody will care.Well, I dont have a camera so youre shit out of luck, Toby said.Im going to at least stay the night here before I make any decisions.And I will need a fire, Im not freezing my ass off, Lisa said.You hiding a lighter?No.Ever build a fire from scratch before?No.Then tell me how you plan to start a fire, Toby asked.I guess Im not, Lisa said.Then use my clothes as a blanket.Lisa stepped back up onto the river bank and picked up Tobys clothes.They smelled like week old sweat.These are so fucking gross, she said.Keep you warm, better to be alive than pretty.I have a better idea, Lisa said.Lets go back to Lancaster.Toby swam around on his back for a while before answering.You want to go back down that death tube?Not really, but at least there they dont know me and I can start over.They were less judgmental there.The grass isnt greener on the other side, and you couldnt wait to get back to Sparksville, remember?You sold me out just to get away.I remember, Lisa said.You have to make the best of where you are, not run away when things get shitty, Toby said.My moms gone, and I dont have anything to keep me here, Lisa said.Do you plan to become a famous model in Lancaster?You could do that here if you put some effort into it.Im not sure I want to be a model anymore.Doesnt matter, spend the night, get cleaned up and go home.I probably dont have a home to go to, I havent been to work in a week, probably dont have a job anymore and cant pay my rent.Im basically homeless.Well, Ive heard of people being raised by wolves in the jungle, I guess you can live in the woods with a beaver, Toby said.The next morning Lisa woke to the smell of bacon.There was a fire and a jug of clean water.She looked to see Toby cooking and stirring a pot of beans.Where did this come from?Lisa asked.Went back to the house and stole it.It was hard, the fire marshal was still out there investigating, Toby said.Lisa crawled over and took some bacon off the stick it was hanging from.She ate it quickly and took another till they were all gone.Dont bother heating the beans, I like them cold, she said.For the next twenty minutes, Lisa ate till she was full and licked the bean juice out of the can.She downed a quart of clean water and felt better than she had in days.Was that really bacon?Or did you cut a chunk off of Paul?she asked with a smile.She was joking, but in the back of her mind maybe she was right.She looked to Toby to be reassured, he ignored her and chewed on a stick.I miss sticks.Toby said.Youre human food tastes like oil and shit.Thanks for getting this, she said.Didnt want you to die out here, dont want your rotting carcass smelling up the place, Toby replied.Thats so special, she said with a wink.Did you happen to find any clothes while you were gone?Lisa asked.No, I like you naked, Toby replied.Why?Im naked, so you should be too.Thats nature, youre supposed to be naked, Lisa said.If you were supposed to wear clothes, youd be born with clothes.I think you like what you see, Lisa said.Toby took a look at Lisa and replied, You have flabby tits and funny shaped nipples.Youre snatch looks like a clam, and overall you look like an ape that shaved.You look like something I took out of a rat trap once, only bigger, Lisa replied with a smile.Youd be better off as a beaver, I dont have a job, I live in a nice beaver dam, I dont have to shop for clothes and I eat all the bark I can find.Although I admire your woodsy outdoors attitude, I dont think bark would taste very good, and from watching you, it looks like it takes an hour to chew, Lisa said.The best kind does, the dry crusty stuff falls apart and usually tastes like termite shit, Toby replied.Lisa sat up and looked at the river.Now what?she asked.What do you mean?I cant live on stolen bacon forever, I need a plan.I thought we discussed this, Toby said spitting out a bug.We did, and I decided I want to go back to Lancaster and start fresh.Toby shook his head.Have fun with that.Youre coming with me, she said.Sorry, I got what I need here, last thing I need is some stupid woman dragging me into a hole and upsetting my life again.What can I do to change your mind?Lisa asked.If I had nothing else to live for I guess Id go, Toby said.Lisa reached over and grabbed a burning stick from the fire and tossed it onto Tobys beaver dam.It sparked and smoked and fell in between the other sticks.There you go, you wont have any place to live in about an hour.Toby swam over to his dam and splashed water with his tail onto the dam until the smoke stopped.No, got to do better than that, he said.Plus, I could rebuild my dam in a week.Ill pick you up and take you with me, she said.I got claws now bitch, try it, Toby said with a grin.Fuck!I cant stay here and you wont go with me, what the hell am I supposed to do?Lisa asked.Youre shit out of luck girlfriend, Toby said.You might want to start building a shelter and looking for food.Lisa picked up the magic box and had an idea, I bet this does more than just fix people and turn them back into beavers.Like what?Toby said swimming on his back.Like grant wishes.I doubt it, Toby said.Its not a genie, you cant just rub it and get what you want.Ive rubbed lots of things and got what I wanted, Lisa laughed.I bet that joke goes over well at the whore house.Lisa took that comment badly.Fuck you, She said and rubbed the box.I wish that Toby would be my slave and do whatever I ask, she said.Toby continued to swim.It was a longshot, but Lisa had to give it a try so she tried it out.Toby, come up here and get a burning stick and light your dam on fire, she said.Without hesitation, Toby swam out of the water and did as she commanded.He picked up a burning stick and tossed it on a dry spot and waited for the whole pile of wood to light up.It took about twenty minutes, but once lit, it burned hot and quick.In less than an hour, the entire dam was burned to the waters edge.Why did I do that?Toby asked looking at the pile of ashes floating down the river.Because I commanded you, Lisa said still holding the magic box.What else can it do?Make you a house?Get you some new clothes?Toby asked.I think it only works on living things, not objects, Lisa said.Try it, Toby said.Lisa rubbed the box and said, I want some clean clothes.Nothing happened.I want a place to live, she said.Still nothing.Maybe you said it wrong, Toby said.Lisa reworded it, I wish I had clean clothes.Nothing happened.I wish Toby would rub my feet, she said and Toby waddled over and rubbed her feet.Yeah, doesnt work on objects, just living things.I dont think I should be rubbing your feet, you still have a nasty wound, Toby said.Lisa grabbed the box and said, I wish my foot was healed, and instantly her foot was healed.Better than the hospital, and no charge, Toby said.Is there anything else I can do for you?Toby asked.Yeah, get ready to leave this shit hole.29   Waterbed      Lisa broke the surface of the swimming pool followed by Toby to find a large man floating on a Styrofoam lounger near the edge.The man was sipping on a drink and was resting in the shade of the umbrella propped up above him attached to the lounger.Up on the edge of the pool, on the cement was a fat woman in a one piece swimming suit reading a book.Walking along the edge was a butler wearing a tuxedo carrying a tray of snacks back to the house.Looks like we have company this time, Toby said.Lisa swam to the edge farthest from the man in the floating lounger and got out of the pool followed by Toby.She didnt know if anyone saw her till she heard a woman's voice call out, Excuse me, this is a private pool.Lisa turned to see the woman with the book looking at her.Shit, She said under her breath and tried to play it off like it was no big deal.Sorry, we wont do it again, she said.We?Whos we?the woman asked.Me and my beaver, Lisa said pointing to Toby who was now walking around the pool edge on the hot concrete.You let a rat in my pool?the woman asked in an outrage.Henry, get your gun and shoot that rat!she said.No!Hes not a rat, hes my friend, Lisa said.You have a rat as a pet?What kind of riff raff are you?Lisa walked over to the woman, water dripping from her nude body in the sun.The closer she got, the more interested the woman became.You do realize there is a cave that leads to your pool dont you?I cant be the first person to come through here.No, I had no idea.Henry, did you know about a cave in our pool?she asked.Henry, a gross, fat and bald man replied, No dear.Doesnt matter anyway, this is my pool and you cant swim in it without my permission.And under no circumstance can you let your pet rat swim in it either.Toby stepped over to the woman, mindful of the hot concrete and stopped in the shade she made.Im not a rat, Im a beaver, he said.The woman looked at Toby like he was a freak.A beaver?she asked.Shouldnt you be in the woods cutting down trees or whatever beavers do?I was about five minutes ago, then we got in the river, got sucked into the cave and got shit out here in your pool.Thats quite the story, the woman said.If thats so, what are you planning to do now?Id like to go find that witch that cut off my tail and made me into stew, Toby replied.The woman looked at Tobys backside and said, You have a tail.I know, long story.And you?the woman asked Lisa.I dont know yet, I want to be a model, but for now I just need a job.A job?Huh, I might be able to help you out with that.Henry, can I hire this girl?
