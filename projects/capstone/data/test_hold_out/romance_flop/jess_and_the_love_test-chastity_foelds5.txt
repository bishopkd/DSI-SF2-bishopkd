In the kitchen, she finished squeezing the lemons and mixed a cup of sugar in the lemonade.The glass pitcher was sweating with condensation.She placed it, along with two iced glasses, on a bamboo serving tray.Jess brought the tray out to the patio.Manolo, she called.Take a break.Have some lemonade.I just made it!Manolo smiled at Jess, put down his vacuum pole, and padded over to the umbrella shaded table.Oh, what a smile.There is no way hes gay.He cant be.Thank you, Mrs.DAngelo, Manolo said.Nice and cold.It took a monster effort of will, but Jess managed to reach out and touch Manolos slick bicep.You work too hard, Manolo.Using the back of his forearm, Manolo wiped sweat and lemonade from his lips.Its very sweet, he said.Too sweet?Im sorry.No, I like it.Manolo smiled.Its very sweet, like you.Jess grew paradoxically flattered and indignant.The last thing I want to be thought of as is sweet!Still, the compliment warmed her heart.Tell him hes sweet too.Tell him!No, not now.Saturday.Manolo, Jess said, would it be possible to pop by Saturday afternoon?Were having a party Sunday, and Id like the pool house and pool to be ship shape.A lie.A little lie.Hell never know.Why should Anthony be the only one to have fun?Jess could have tried to seduce Manolo right then and there, but she needed time to get her courage up.Is no problem, Mrs.DAngelo.I can come by on Saturday.Say something witty and charming.Cmon Jess, say something!Yoo hoo!Anyone home?Isabella called out.She had let herself in through the gate and was coming around the corner of the house.Jess pulled her hand away from Manolos arm, and Manolo noticed.Isabella was wearing all black again, despite the heat, and she carried her huge tote bag.There you are, she cried.Hi Manolo.My, youre looking fit.Thank you Mrs.Sheffield, Manolo said.Then, looking a bit sheepish, Manolo put down his glass of lemonade and went back to vacuuming the pool.Once he was out of earshot, Isabella said, You never make me fresh lemonade.You dont deserve any, Jess said.Why not?Whats wrong, honey?Jess plopped onto a patio chair and pulled out a tissue.Im not going to cry.Im not going to cry.Itll ruin my makeup.Anthony is cheating on me, Jess sobbed.Isabella leaned forward and hugged Jess.Isabellas bosom was large and soft a place of comfort.Oh, honey, Isabella said.Im so sorry.Are you okay?They stayed that way for a while, and finally Isabella sat back on another patio chair.Ive been so stupid, Jess said.All the signs were there.Why didnt I figure it out sooner?Honey, Isabella said, dont take this the wrong way, but we all figured you condoned it.We?Jess cried.Everyone knows?It seemed obvious to us.Your caveman husband is not the most discrete.
