Duke shook his head, But Lenny wouldnt have it.Nope.Our Bird had to be free.Duke nodded to the starlit mountain line.Out there, the only place Ive seen her truly happy.His words hung in the silent cold for a while.So youre saying that its probably not gonna last.Luke responded quietly, feeling his gut twist.I didnt say that.Duke countered.I said it would be one hell of a ride.Duke gave a sly smile.Dont give up.Youre already loads better than that tool, Shane.I thought Shane was perfect.Luke grumbled despondently.Ha!Yeah, he sure was pretty.Duke let out a dark chuckle.He wasnt all that.He was nice but he wasnt any good for her.What makes me different?Luke couldn't help but ask.Here he was, with someone who probably knew Lenny better than she knew herself.What made Luke the guy?After her accident, a little piece of her died.I know that sounds macabre but its true.She left a chunk of herself out there.Shane tried to bring her back to life, I tried, her folks tried but it was no use.It was like talking to a walking corpse.Duke breathed out through is nose.But shes suddenly back.I look in her eyes and I see her in there.Dukes voice grew thick with emotion.Youre the one who found her.Luke looked back up at the stars.He wanted badly for what Duke said to be true.He had never felt for anyone the way he felt for Lenny.But was that enough?She obviously had issues with commitment and an addiction to fight or flight.Its worth it.Duke said into the darkness as if reading his thoughts.Grab that light and dont let go.12    Magpies On Fire      After several minutes outside with Duke, Sway came and got Luke, asking him to be his partner in the pool tournament.Luke had reluctantly agreed, wanting more to sulk in the cold.As the game got underway, Luke regretted even more that he'd agreed to this.For some reason, Cody was the only girl in the room and she was being very...vigilant.She kept finding reasons to stand very close to him.She hardly spoke to him, but he could feel eyes on him wherever he took a shot.He and Sway won the first round and moved on to the next.All Luke could think about was how he hadn't seen Lenny in over a week and he was playing pool with a bunch of dudes he didn't know with a drunk chick attached to his hip.It was not his ideal situation.Some of the guys cleared out to race snowmobiles and Luke and Sway went onto the next round.You're really good at this game.Cody leaned over and Luke caught a whiff of vodka off her words.She must have some stashed nearby, Luke hadn't seen any being served.Thanks.He responded tersely as he lined up his shot.Cody pressed her body against his side and he felt her hot breath in his ear.After this game you want to go...somewhere?Luke's stomach roiled inside and he clenched his teeth.He made his shot despite Cody's interference and he walked away from her to the other side of the room.Sway gave him a perplexed look and Luke ignored him.Cody was close behind, not deterred in the slightest.Luke wasn't sure how to deal with this.He was used to women pawing at him, but it had never been the best friend of the girl he was with.Wasn't this against girl code?Did girls have a code?Just then, Blake walked into the room.Shirtless.Luke could have kissed him.Hey, Luke handed him his cue, Play for me, I have to go do a thing.He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder.Blake didn't hesitate, he grabbed the cue in one hand and Cody around the waist with the other.Be my lucky charm?He grinned down at her and she giggled.Luke was thankful for his brash and bold band mate as he booked it out of there.He needed to find Lenny.He knew a couple of hours had passed and he had to talk to her.This wasn't right.The snowmobile races wrapped up and Duke put the sleds away.Lenny watched from the patio, her hands shoved deep in her coat pockets.What a crappy New Year's.For her anyway.Everyone else seemed to be having a wonderful time.Did it bother her that she hadn't seen Luke in a while?Yes.Did it bother her that she also had not seen Cody during that time?More than she liked to admit.Luke didn't want to appear frantic.So he casually strolled through the huge Lodge that was packed with people.He smiled and chatted with those who recognized him but he was searching for Lenny.He glanced in what he assumed was some sort of den.It was fairly dark, lit only by a few candles artistically placed around the room.No one else was in the room and he took a few steps inside to see if there might be another room beyond a door or something.This house was massive and damn if he hadn't already gotten turned around a few times in it.There you are.Luke turned to see Cody closing the door and smiling at him seductively.Hey, Cody.Have you seen Lenny?Luke tried to remain polite but she was testing his patience.Cody curled a lip up, Why do you care where Lenny is?She's not here, that's all that matters.She began to step towards him and Luke shook his head in wonder.How were they even friends?You can do to me all the things you want to do to her.She's never gonna love you.She only cares about herself.Cody slid her hands up Luke's shoulders and pressed her body against him.Luke grabbed her hands and took a large step backwards.You're drunk, Cody.He tried to give her an excuse but he knew in his gut that this is who she really was.And it sickened him.Cody, your ride is here.A gruff voice interrupted them and Luke looked up, startled to see Duke standing in the doorway.Cody didn't even seem to notice.She leaned towards Luke again.Duke entered the room and grabbed Cody by the arm.Your ride is here.He repeated, his eyes flashing to Luke's.Cody struggled against him as he forced her out the door.What's your problem, Duke?She shrieked, wrestling out of his grasp.Duke scooped her up and flung her over his shoulder.He nodded at Luke, Can you help me with the door?Luke had no words; he just did as the man asked.The way to the front door was cleared of human presence and Luke wondered how that was even possible.But it would probably benefit Cody some if no one saw the degrading way she was being asked to leave.The limo driver waiting outside didn't even look surprised as Duke shoved his niece into the car.The rest of her friends were already inside and Luke heard a plethora of questions being hurled in Cody's direction.Duke slammed the car door and the driver made haste getting underway.Duke placed his hands on his hips and gave Luke a hard stare.You want to tell me what that was?His words coming out as white puffs in the cold air.I was looking for Lenny.Luke knew what it must have looked like when Duke had opened the door but he had to know the reality.Didn't he?Duke met him with silence.His frown deeper than Luke had seen it all night and he realized that with one word, Duke could turn Lenny against him.If Duke didn't want him around this was the perfect opportunity to make that happen.Lenny cruised through the Lodge reminding all the remaining guests that the countdown to midnight was happening in fifteen minutes.She had no explanation for why Blake and Sway were both playing pool in only their boxers and she didn't ask.She found Harrison and Mike had taken over the DJ's job and were playing a mix all their own.It seemed that Cody and the rest of her friends had vacated early and Lenny felt a mixture of relief and apprehension.She still hadn't seen Luke and her worst fear was that he had left with Cody.He wouldn't do that?Would he?Nathan, Lenny almost ran into her brother as he came in from the backyard.Have you seen Luke?Nathan nodded over his shoulder, He's out back with Duke.They're having some sort of heavy conversation.Lenny frowned.What?She had just been back there and hadn't seen either one of them.She grabbed her coat and hat and went back out into the cold.The sound from the party got louder and then quieted again as someone came outside from the patio door.Soft footsteps on the granite came toward them and Luke looked up to see Lenny approaching slowly.She had put on a dark coat and a black stocking cap, making her blonde hair and creamy skin stand out.She shoved her hands in her coat pockets and stood in front of him.I think we need to talk.Her eyes flicked over to Duke momentarily and Luke had to wonder again at the extent of their friendship.He knew what Duke had told him but how could he be sure there wasn't more there?I think so, too.Luke agreed.He definitely had some questions.Duke, could you give us a minute?Lenny asked.Duke sighed as he slowly stood up.He grumbled something unintelligible to himself.He patted Luke on the shoulder.Remember what I told you.Luke nodded but didnt reply.Lenny sat down in Dukes vacated chair and frowned at his figure as he let himself into the house.What did Duke tell you?Guy stuff, Luke hedged.What do you want to talk about?Lenny closed her eyes like she was trying to get her thoughts in line before she spoke.Im sorry about what...Erin said in there.I had no ideaany of that was going to happen.Was it true?Luke kept his voice flat.What do you mean?Lenny was playing too innocent, she was hiding again.Were you and Shane more serious than you led me to believe?Luke asked evenly, not wanting it to come out like he was threatened.I dont see how that matters, she answered darkly.Really?Cmon, Lenny.Lukes eyes bored into hers.Was he in love with you?She swallowed several times before answering, I dont know.I mean, how can you really know what someone else feels?He said he did but that doesnt mean anything.But II didnt love him back.And I never told him I loved him.How long were you guys together?Luke was afraid of the answer but he had to know.He had to know where that put them.If there even was a them to be worried about.A little over two years  Lenny broke off as Luke cursed under his breath.And you broke up with him how long before you met me?He knew he sounded accusatory but he was too agitated to stop.The corner of Lenny's mouth twitched and she looked cornered, trapped.Luke hated himself for making her feel that way.But she didn't run away, instead, she set her jaw and spoke plainly.I sent him a text, telling him it wasnt working.From the airport.Right before I boarded the plane and met you.Her voice was devoid of emotion.A text?Lenny?A text?To a man who is in love with you?Luke was losing it.Lenny's lack of emotion seemed to amplify his.He knew he was overreacting, but his train of rational thought had derailed a few minutes ago and he wasn't getting it back anytime soon.I dont understand why this so upsetting for you.Lenny spoke coldly.Im not with him, I dont have feelings for him, why does this make you crazy?Luke shot up from his chair and put both hands on top of his hair as he stepped a few paces across the patio and stood with his back to Lenny.She was the first girl that he had ever revealed so much of himself to.The first one who looked at him and he really felt like she saw him.Not the public image of him, the one girls wanted to sleep with so they could feel famous.But who he was at his center.At his most real.He took a couple of breaths and then turned back to her, his heart racing with both hope and fear.Mind numbing, logic splintering fear.Because, Lenny.Because I'm in love with you and it's turning me into a freaking basket case.He took a step forward.Because Im crazy about you.Because I love just being near you.Because I want to be with you all the time.Because you mean so frickin' much to me.And, from what everyone else has said, I cant help but think that Shane felt the same way and you He shook his head and raked his hands through his hair in exasperation.I what?Lenny narrowed her eyes at him.Luke dropped his hands against his thighs, You...you dont care.You already said you didnt have feelings for him.For two years.He sighed heavily.Am I just supposed to wait around until you finally figure out that you dont have feelings for me either?Will it just come in the form of a text?Lennys frown was deep as she responded.What we have is different than what I had with Shane.You cant compare the two.Luke sat down again and grabbed her by her hands, looking her in the eye.Then tell me what we have.What is this?He stared into her dark blue eyes, eyes that were the same color as the night sky.Eyes that just a few weeks ago had looked at him in peace and adoration but seemed deep and empty tonight.The noise from the party grew as the countdown began to midnight.Luke kept hold of her, waiting for a response.I dont know.She said stiffly, giving him the exact answer that he had been afraid of.Luke held her hands a moment longer and then slumped into his chair, defeated.The revelers started to go home after an hour or so and the house became quieter.The caterers and DJ had cleaned up and cleared out.Lenny walked through the dark, empty Lodge, picking up trash and leftover drinks.She blew out the candles and turned lights off in vacant rooms.After she had told Luke she didn't know how to define their relationship, he had gotten up and gone for a walk.Lenny had stayed on the back patio long enough for everyone to leave or go to bed so she wouldnt have to talk to anyone.She could barely feel her fingers and toes when she had slid the back door open.She stuffed the last of the trash into the bag in her hand.This was not how she was hoping tonight would have gone.She was glad the rest of her guests had had a good time but things with her and Luke wereawkward at best.He wanted some kind of absolution from her and she didnt know what to think, let alone what to feel.She knew she hadaffection for him.But there was no way that could sustain a relationship.Especially when one of them was as busy and famous as Luke.She took the full trash bag out to the garage and put it in the can, pausing to look at the back wall.She sighed heavily as she slowly walked towards what had been her vehicle to freedom since she was a child.She missed it.Desperately.Like the way a person misses air from the bottom of a pool.She hadn't felt free...in a long time.She turned when someone in the doorway cleared their throat.Duke stood watching her in navy blue pajama pants and a long sleeve white tee shirt.She thought he had gone to bed with everyone else.Deep thoughts?He asked.She half smirked, Are there any other kinds?He stepped down into the garage and stood next to Lenny with his hands in his pockets.What happened with you and Eddie Vedder?Lenny smiled at Dukes nickname for Luke.At least it was better than Tool Shed which is what he had called Shane the entire time they were together.Nothing.We argued, sort of.I don't know.Lenny said, regret touching her voice.Did he tell you that Cody made a play for him?Lenny felt like she'd gotten kicked in the gut.She wasn't surprised but to have it confirmed made it harder to deny Cody's true nature.No, her mouth was instantly dry.He didn't mention it.And why should he?That didn't shock you.It was a statement.Lenny didn't reply, she was running out of words to try and explain things away.What did you argue about then?Duke pressed.He wants something I can't give him.Lenny rolled her eyes at the absurdity.Imagine, a man stressing over the girl not ready for a commitment.He wants to know how I feel.She scoffed, thinking Duke would laugh with her.How do you feel?He asked her seriously, looking at the garage floor.I don't know, Duke.Lenny frowned at him.Why do you care?Her stomach tightened as the mood in the room shifted with her words.Cmon, Lenny.Dont you think youre kind of being a brat about this?Dukes tone had an edge he had never directed at Lenny and she was taken off guard.What do you mean?She felt bitterness crawl into her mouth and she grit her teeth together.Duke's sudden coldness was neither helpful nor warranted.Im not gonna lecture you or give a big speech.Just He took a few seconds to collect his thoughts and when he started speaking again she felt his agitation towards her in a way that she never had before.He was disappointed in her.Life is hard, Lenny.And people tend to suck, I mean, no ones perfect.We need someone in our lives to help us through it.We make each other better, stronger.Yeah, but who's to say that I need Luke?Lenny clipped, feeling herself getting defensive.Fed up, Duke waved his hand at the back wall of snowboards and raised his voice, Thats your passion, right there, hanging on the wall like a dead animal!You really just gonna walk away from your first true love?He turned and waved at the Lodge, That man in there, brought you back to life when the rest of us were afraid you were beyond hope.And you dont know how you feel?The reasons you wont get back on the board or admit your feelings for Luke are the same.Youre afraid of losing the control.You think you cant get hurt if you can control it.Well, guess what?Love isnt like that.Youre either all in or not.He let out a disgusted breath and paced a short distance across the garage floor.Lennys face was hot.She was angry.Duke didn't have the right to tell her her reasons.They were hers and hers alone, she didn't owe him an explanation.And she didn't owe Luke one either.I thought you said you werent going to lecture me, she bit out.I lied!Duke snapped indignantly.Your family and I have been far too forgiving and coddling to you.You need to grow up one of these days.This coming from a guy who hates organized sports and lives alone in a house I paid for!Lenny was taking it too far but she wanted to hurt him the way he was hurting her.Hey!Duke stormed towards her, pointing his finger in her face.I dont need your charity, say the word and Im gone!Lenny stood her ground, she was afraid in that moment that maybe Duke actually would leave but she was too stubborn to take back her words.Instead she jutted out her chin and clenched her jaw.You cant keep running away from the things that scare you!Duke threw his hands out to the sides in exasperation.I didn't run away!Lenny shouted back, angry tears burning the back of her eyes.Really?His sarcasm thick, Then what would you call it?Escaping!Lenny's stomach fell to the floor as she shouted her truth across the garage.His eyes grew wide at her response and she felt her hands starting to tremble.The room was quiet and Lenny could hear her pulse roaring through her ears.She looked down at the floor, unable to watch Duke's face as he tried to read her mind.Tried to figure out where she had gone.She was tired of carrying her secret for so long.She knew it had changed her.She had let it change her, propelled that change.She didnt want to be who she had been.She wanted to be someone else.She wanted to be safe.Were you a prisoner?He asked, his voice calm, concerned.I'm not...I'm not doing this.Lenny's voice sounded tired and scared.Duke knew he was almost there.He didn't want to push her.He had wanted her to come to terms with it on her own.She was more stubborn than he had given her credit for.He knew that there was a huge likelihood that she would hate him after this.He had to take that risk.She needed him to.What happened, Lenny?It was the question everyone kept asking her, the one she had never answered.I told you, I don't remember.She crossed her arms over her middle and stared at the floor.Duke thought she looked especially small like that.You've never forgotten a detail in your life.Tell me the truth.His voice was hard, unforgiving.A flash of terror went across her face.How he hated himself.What happened to the girl who looked fear in the face and laughed as she found her line?Her eyes unfocused and he knew he was reaching her.What happened to the girl who flew past seasoned backwoods riders and raged down the ridge line in Alaska?She shifted and turned away from him.Duke was close, he could feel it.He was going to have to wreck her before he could save her.He raised his voice again, forcing the issue.What happened, Lenny?Whered she go?I cant do this.Lenny started to the door of the garage but Duke got there first.No, we do this now.No more running.He blocked the way with his body and Lenny tried to push past him but he was solid.He grabbed her by her shoulders and looked into her face as she stared at the center of his chest.Let me by, Duke.Lenny said, a false fire on her tongue.No.Duke repeated.He clenched his jaw, having a final debate with his insides on whether or not he should be doing this.I want to know what happened to you.He swallowed his own fear and took a deep breath.I wanna know where the girl is that I fell in love with.Lenny met his eyes at last and he saw pain and betrayal covered by confusion.What?The word was a whisper and he almost didn't hear it due to the ringing in his ears at his own confession.Yeah, Lenny.His voice low.Where is the strong, powerful, confident woman that I am hopelessly in love with?He'd said it twice now.He hoped he didn't throw up before they got through this.Lenny looked down at the floor; she reeled like she'd just gotten the wind knocked out of her.She turned to walk away but Duke grabbed her arm and whirled her back to face him.Lenny pushed him away with force, her face twisted in anger.Stop saying that!She yelled.Stop using that word!What is wrong with you people?She backed away from Duke, her eyes wild.Shane, Luke, now YOU?!You dont know what love is!Stop throwing that word around like it means something!She screamed at him, her hands clenched into fists at her sides.Duke felt his tears pool in the corners of his eyes as he watched her fall apart in front of him.He couldn't stop now, he was committed, and they were almost there.He grabbed her by the shoulders again and looked her square in the face.Tell me what happened, Lenny!Tell me what really happened before the accident!'Cause I know damn good and well this isnt about a bad wreck!Tears started to spill down Lennys cheeks as they stared at one another.The look of defeat that hung in her eyes broke his heart.A sob caught in her chest as she tried to breathe normally and Duke folded her into his arms.He held her body as it shook with released emotion.Shane slept with Cody.She clung to him as the truth escaped her lips.Duke closed his eyes and held her close.So that was it.That was the big secret.When?He asked gently, pressing his cheek to the top of her head.At the Olympics, the day before my event...the day before the crash.Her breathing steadied as she brought her emotions under control again.I caught them.They said that it was my fault for being, she swallowed and her voice was laced with cynicism, Such a tease.They said I was incapable of love and Shane needed a release before his event.And I was too selfish to help him with it.A disgusted shiver swept through her body and Duke resisted the urge to put his fist through a wall.I couldn't get my head right, I lost focus.Lenny continued shakily.That's how I wrecked.She pulled away from him and tried to wipe the watery mess off her face.She was red and splotchy but her eyes were clear.Finally.Duke didn't want to let her go.He wanted to hold her until she felt safe again.But that wasn't his place.Instead, he sat down on the garage step and she settled next to him.The rest of the story spilled out unencumbered and he had to bite his tongue to keep from going off on his own tangent against Shane and Cody.After the accident, they both came to see me in the hospital.The doctor said I had enough brain damage that I probably would never remember the previous twenty four hours.So I went with it.I just couldn't foresee trying to figure out how to walk again while dealing with their shit, you know?I thought they'd get tired of the whole thing and move on if I ignored them.Then Shane moved out here and Cody wouldn't shut up about a rematch and I guess I just decided I wanted to try a different life for a while.One where I didn't have to see those two every day.Why didn't you just confront them after you'd recovered?Duke couldn't help but ask.Because then they would have known that I lied about forgetting it.And I was afraid that would make me just like them.You could never be like them.Duke put an arm around her shoulder and pulled her against his side.I didn't realize how much time had gone by until I found the engagement ring in Shane's truck.I couldn't live a lie, I had to leave.She paused and looked up at Duke, her face sorrowful.Im sorry I didnt tell you sooner.No, Lenny Duke cut her off.They were wrong on so many levels.I understand why you split.You dont have to apologize.Lenny was quiet for a long time and then she said, I cant stop thinking that they might be right.Duke looked at her with a frown.What if I am incapable of love?Duke sighed heavily and held her tighter.Youre just incapable of their twisted version of love.You have more heart and passion than anyone I have ever met.I see you with your family and your friends and even complete strangers.Youre kind and compassionate and you honestly care.He paused, letting his words sink in.Youre capable of great love; greater than those two will ever experience in their lifetime.He wrapped both of his arms around her and blinked back his own tears.Finally.After so much avoidance and running away, maybe now she could begin to move forward.He knew there had been a connection between her accident and her resistance to fall in love.If he could just get her past her fear, shed fall headlong in love with the man who deserved her the most.And as much as Duke hated to admit it, it wasnt him.We need to get you on a line as soon as possible.You can't let them take that away from you.And not up at Aspen, here, on your home turf.His voice was thick with emotion.What if its been too long?What if I forgot everything youve taught me?She asked honestly.Then I can re teach you.Duke replied.Ill always have your back, you know that.She seemed to consider his proposal and he felt a thrill go through him that she didn't outright say no this time.How about you get some sleep, and well talk about a plan tomorrow over breakfast.He helped her into a standing position.She gave him a contrite smile, I think I really screwed things up with Luke tonight.One thing at a time.Lets get you on a line first.We can fix everything with Thor after that.Thor?Lenny asked quizzically.Well, you know, he has that chiseled jaw and those piercing blue eyes.Lenny laughed as Duke directed her up into the house and shut off the lights to the garage.They took the sleds as far as they could and then started to hike up the mountain, the terrain getting steeper the further they climbed.Lenny refused to think about what was waiting ahead.Instead she focused on the climb.She tried to drink in the wilderness.Savoring every breath that included the scent of fresh pine.Her steps were solid, she didnt have trouble finding safe footing the whole way up.Duke was ahead of her and she could tell he was making sure to clear a little of the path to make it easier for her.She was, after all, out of practice.The band had protested, when then found out what the plan was but Lenny calmly explained that this was something she had to do.She could tell they felt left out by being left at the Lodge, but she had to do this without an audience.Luke, especially, seemed jilted.But like Duke said, one thing at a time.Duke was proud of Lenny for telling him the whole truth last night; he knew it hadnt been easy.He was determined that she see this through.Nothing had ever seemed so right like when Lenny took to the slopes.His insides were still churning from all the new information.Shane had better stay away or Duke would end him.And Cody, even though she was Dukes niece, was no longer welcome in his home.Lenny was really the only one who had ever mattered to Duke.Shed saved his life at a time when he was falling apart.Hed gotten into the Hollywood scene of snowboarding and things went from awesome to terrifying very quickly.You can only drink yourself into a blackout so many times before you decide that enough is enough.He got off the bottle and moved to the mountains where he met his nieces best friend.Lenny had been only twelve, but she was bold and daring and full of natural talent.Duke took the little bird under his wing and taught her all he knew.She gave him a reason to get up even when the depression threatened to force him to drink again.She took the information he gave her and turned herself into a legend.He started to only see her in the winter as school and competing took first place.But they stayed in good contact by phone.Then, after she had graduated high school at midterm, she wanted to take a trip into the back country of Alaska and ride some fresh powder.Duke hustled up some of his old riding buddies and arranged a two week trip for his protg.But when Bird showed up, she wasnt this gangly little middle schooler anymore.She was nineteen and had transformed into a woman with unrivaled beauty.Her time spent on the mountains all over the world had given her an untamed, natural allure that was fiercely captivating.Duke spent most of the trip threatening his friends every time one of them so much as glanced at her.His buddies did their best to show off but Lenny would match them, challenge for challenge.She had finally come into her own and Duke had nothing left to teach her.Thats where it had happened.Thats where Duke began to look at her with brand new eyes.She was wild and unstoppable and fearless.He admired her for her talent and strength and courage.And little by little, he allowed himself to fall in love with her, knowing that nothing could ever come of it.She saw him as an old man, and a friend.And Duke was content with that, feeling blessed to have her friendship, to be that close to a wildfire and not get burned.Duke had turned thirty during that trip to Alaska.He was in the prime of his physical riding career.But even at the top of his game, he took a little spill.He wrecked pretty majorly, cracking a couple ribs and getting bruised all to hell.Lenny had taken careful diligence to patch him back up, chewing him out the whole time for being reckless.He knew he would never forget the way her hands felt on his skin.Or how her hair fell past her face and tickled his bare chest as she leaned over to pack ice around his shoulder.He knew that was the closest that hed ever get.And he had savored every second.His little confession the night before hadnt come back up.He knew she hadnt forgotten it, not with her perfect memory, but he didnt want to talk about it anyway.He knew she needed someone that could offer her more than he could.He had accepted that years ago.He had risked his heart and his heart alone, he could deal with that.They crested the top of Lennys favorite ridge and she felt her heart beating faster and it wasn't just from the climb.The mountains opened up before her and she could see for miles.I never get tired of that.Duke breathed next to her.Lenny could only nod.He turned and waited for her to make the first move.I dont know if I can do this Duke.Lenny was thinking about trying to convince him that it wasnt time, she wasnt ready.This is how its going to work.Duke was all business.You're gonna strap in, then youre gonna dig your chute, then your whole life is gonna change.How do you know?Lenny was half stalling and half really wanting to know.How do you know this is the answer?Lenny, you have to try, he said gently.Ill be right here if anything goes wrong.Lenny took a deep breath.She leveled off the space where she would start her line and looked down the mountainside.Her legs were trembling and her heart was racing.She looked at Duke, her eyes pleading for another way, but she knew she had to do it.Now that she was up there, she could feel an old persistence creeping up from her toes and making its way to her head.She had to go.She had to fly.She knew she was moving quickly but it felt like slow motion.She could feel the texture of the snow as it bent beneath her, carving a perfect path.She let go of all she had been holding back and images started to flash through her mind.Her fight with Shane, walking in on him and Cody getting dressed, the following argument.The initial crash, the slow process of recovery, fights with her parents, avoiding Shane, running away with Double Blind Study, Luke.Luke and his voice and his lips and his amazingly strong arms.She veered to the left, following her instincts, taking her line over a ridge and going airborne.The rush was intoxicating.It was better than she had remembered.She landed gracefully, fluidly.Her body a perfectly oiled machine, moving and adjusting with the terrain before her.She controlled her speed, enjoying every twist and edge.Her mind was finally starting to put things in order.This is where she belonged, out in the open.Free.Not the condescending Freebird that Cody and Shane had constantly called her which was more a ridicule than a nickname.No, more innocent than that.Duke had given her the nickname Bird the first time he met her.He compared her to a lark and would always quote lines from his favorite George Meredith poem to her while they hiked up to a new chute.As she went over another lip and caught even more air than before, his voice echoed through her mind:  He rises and begins to round,  He drops the silver chain of sound  Of many links without a break,  In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake,  All intervolved and spreading wide,  Like water dimples down a tide  Where ripple ripple overcurls  And eddy into eddy whirls;  A press of hurried notes that run  So fleet they scarce are more than one,  Yet changing ly the trills repeat  And linger ringing while they flee,  In that moment, as she seemed to hover in the air with Duke's voice echoing through her head and the images of what had happened flashed before her, she realized that it wasn't her fault.What Shane and Cody had done was their choice.She didn't earn their betrayal.The blame belonged on them.And it had been wrong for them to try to put it on her.But it had been even worse that she had allowed them to blame her.She allowed them to make her feel like she had no worth, like she was nothing.And she had started running, slowly at first and then gaining momentum with her decision to make that interview with Carl.She thought if she got far enough away, she'd stop feeling so trapped in her own weakness.But only facing the truth of what had happened could truly release her.She finally felt absolved of the guilt that had accompanied their disloyalty and vilification.Lenny landed safely again, nearly breathless.Her mind having been put right and finally at peace.She guided the board expertly to a stop and pushed her goggles up on her head.She could see Duke making his descent and she shook her head.He never followed her line.It was like an unspoken rule between them.They each had to find their own way.He came to the edge of a ridge she knew was too steep of a drop, thats why she had avoided it.She held her breath, hoping against her own gut that he wouldnt go for it.Sonofabitch Lenny muttered as Duke dropped off the ridge and out of view.She waited for a few seconds, her heart starting to thud in her chest.Suddenly, Duke sprang over a slope and raged down the rest of the mountain.Lenny breathed a sigh of relief.Duke came skidding to a stop right in front of her, huge grin plastered on his face.Did you see that?Thought I was a goner for sure!He yelled excitedly.You scared me half to death!Lenny yelled back, laughing.Duke disengaged his boots and scooped her up in a huge hug.She laughed freely as he swung her around.She hadn't forgotten how to fly after all.13    The Deepest Blues Are Black      Lenny and Duke had been gone all day.It was only mid afternoon but it might as well have been midnight with the way Luke's head was messing with him.He was trying really hard to be the rational, reasonable guy that his band mates knew and loved but having Lenny out in the wilderness with a man who was undoubtedly in love with her had pushed his rationality over a cliff.Jealously wasn't something that Luke had ever had to deal with.Not since high school anyway.He felt like an idiot.Even after Duke had all but given his blessing the night before, Luke still felt...tense.Here they come.Mike interrupted his brooding and nodded out the large windows facing the back of the house.Sure enough, two snowmobiles were pulling up out back.Lenny disembarked and said something to Duke before entering the house through the back door.Duke drove his sled towards the garage to put it away.Hey guys!Lenny's face was red from the cold and she had snow stuck in her hair.She took off her hat and gloves and started removing her coat.How was it?Harrison bounded across the room and jumped onto the back of the sofa, eager for the recap.Lenny laughed at him and Luke noticed that it was louder, more released than before.Her smile was wide and her face radiant.He thought she was beautiful before, but this was a whole new experience.It was...perfect.Lenny giggled again and the guys exchanged puzzled smiles.Mike was the only one who seemed to not be surprised.He grinned broadly and wrapped her into a hug.Her arms encircled him in return and they shared a moment that Luke knew he'd never fully grasp.So, what happens now?Blake frowned and crossed his arms.Are you leaving the tour or what?Luke hadn't even considered that Lenny being able to return to snowboarding might mean her leaving their lives.Of course not!Lenny exclaimed as her hug with Mike ended.You can't get rid of me that easily.Her eyes swung over to Luke and she said a thousand different things to him with that one look.A recklessness burned on the edge of her irises and he realized that something in her had been awakened in the past few hours.It was a definite turn on.But, I have to fill you in on a few...unsavory details of my life.Lenny made a face as she entered the kitchen.You guys hungry?I'm starving, I need nutrients.The band gathered in the kitchen and Lenny fixed them up with sandwiches.Duke joined them after he had put the sleds away and Lenny calmly explained the details of her 'reckoning' as Duke had called it.The group absorbed the information and came to the same collective opinion.That Shane was the worst and Cody was the devil.Luke hoped that he and Lenny would have a second chance at their conversation from the night before.Having been filled in on the details of her relationship with Shane now, Luke could absolutely see how the two didn't compare.He wasn't Shane, and he never would be.He needed to make sure that Lenny understood that.This probably changes a lot of things about Aspen.Sway stated the obvious.I still have to go.Lenny threw a towel at Duke when he rolled his eyes.Contractual obligations.But I would still love it if you guys all joined me.She looked around at them hopefully.Of course well be there, mama.Blake grinned mischievously.Absolutely.Sway agreed, linking eyes with Blake and mirroring his smile.Are we gonna have a talk with Shane?Harrison asked, noticing his friends weird behavior.Youre awesome at subtly, you know that?Blake closed his eyes in frustration.What?Harrison asked, perplexed.Are you coming too?Luke directed at Duke.Nah, you guys got this.I hate it up there, too many people.Luke inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.While he respected Duke and his position in Lennys life he couldnt help but feel like Dukes presence would keep he and Lenny from getting any closer.They packed their bags that night and got ready to depart for the weekend in Aspen.Duke would drive them all to the airport early the next morning.Lenny was actually looking forward to the trip now, her conscience clear and her mind focused.Shane and Cody may have held her back in the beginning but she had chosen to stay there.Now she was back.She stood in her room looking out over the dark mountains being lit by the moon.She stretched her tight muscles and closed her eyes.She started when she heard someone in the doorway.It was Duke, again.He looked a little more friendly than he had the night before in the garage.You always did have the best view up here.He nodded out the large, wall sized windows.Lenny smiled, walking over to her bed and sitting on the edge.She motioned with her head for Duke to join her.She saw him consider it for a moment before relenting and sitting down.When you coming back?Duke asked softly.We have to leave for London right after Aspen.So, youre still gonna be the assistant?Yeah, for now.Its really fun.Lennys voice got wistful.And theyre really good guys, I like being there for them.Youve always been a good friend.Duke looked down at his hands and then back out the window.Ill come home after that.Lenny leaned her shoulder against his, sensing his melancholy mood.You dont have to promise anything right now.Things can still change between now and then.Duke pointed out.Lenny let out a heavy sigh, Duke was right.Anything could happen she supposed.Ill call you.She decided to promise instead.Duke chuckled.Good.Thatll be nice.The silence became comfortable, like it always did between them.She felt him take a deep breath and he put an arm around her.She eased into his embrace and closed her eyes.For singing till his heaven fills,  T is love of earth that he instills,  And ever winging up and up,  Our valley is his golden cup,  And he the wine which overflows  To lift us with him as he goes  Duke's deep voice reciting his favorite poem to her, the poem he had given to her when she was still a child, along with all the heavy emotions they had shared with one another over the past few days, it was almost enough to make her heartbeat stop.He did love her.She had no doubts.Thank you, Duke.She whispered into his chest.For what?Duke grunted.For never giving up on me.Lenny said quietly.Duke didnt know what to say, so he didnt say anything.He was content to hold her until she had fallen asleep.He picked up her resting body and placed it carefully on the bed, pulling a blanket over her bare arms.He stared down at her, wanting to be the one who could...just wanting to be the one.Duke walked down the steps slowly and made his way to his room.He crawled into his own bed in the dark and listened to the quiet of the house.He enjoyed living alone but he would miss Lenny desperately.Part of him hoped that she and Luke would run off and get married in Europe and never come home.All he ever wanted was for her to have an unending adventure.He knew that Luke could offer all of that and so much more.Besides, Luke was totally in love with her.She would be safe with him.Spinning around quickly, Lenny shoved the last of her clothes in the dresser in her suite.She knew she only had a few minutes before the band showed up at her room and she really didn't want to be unpacking her underwear in front of them.She slid the empty duffel into the closet just as there was a knock on her door.Her loud and rowdy group entered the room with more fanfare than was necessary but it still made her smile.Check out the view you have!Sway whistled as he flopped himself onto her bed.See?I told you.Harrison said to Blake.Her room is always better than ours.And I told you its because shes better than us.Blake replied.And I told both of you to knock it off.Lenny reprimanded with a smile.The view was pretty stunning.Buttermilk Mountain had been turned into a phenomenal course for the Winter X Games.Hundreds of people had worked tirelessly on it for weeks now, constructing the perfect place for one of the most exciting competitions in the world.Thousands of pounds of snow had been moved and rearranged to create both ideal and difficult terrain for the athletes.Lenny and the guys had been some of the first to arrive.She had a room to herself but the guys split three rooms between them.She wasnt sure how that worked out and didnt ask.Luke had his hands in his pockets and stood regarding her carefully.They still hadn't had a moment alone together since their last very tense conversation.She felt heat creep up her neck as his blue eyes flicked up and down the length of her.She couldn't stand the wall that seemed to be between them and she impulsively threw her arms around his neck.His arms wrapped around her immediately and he buried his face in her neck letting out a small groan, I missed you.I missed you back, she whispered in his ear.Um, do you guys want to be alone?Blake interrupted from behind her.Luke let her go and smiled crookedly.Lenny rolled her eyes at Blake and readjusted her hoodie as she turned around.She walked to the dresser and grabbed their VIP passes she had gotten from Patrick and passed them out.These will get you into all the events and the VIP tent.She stepped back and put her hands in her back pockets as she further explained.I have X Fest today and tomorrow.Patrick stacked my schedule to appease as many sponsors as possible.I have two interviews today, an hour in the autograph booth and a demo.You guys can have free reign, just dont embarrass me.She added with a grin, she knew they would be amazing, she had no doubts.Not even about Sway.Her phone made a chirp noise and she picked it up off the dresser glancing at the screen.It was Cody, wondering if she was here yet.Lenny put the phone in her pocket without bothering to reply.Hey, when do we get to meet Shane?Harrison asked from his corner.In a perfect world, never.But chances are hes lurking around here somewhere.Hes kind of a media whore.Lenny replied sourly.Were famous, too, Sway pointed out.Not as famous as he is in this place, Lenny countered.Why do you want to meet him at all?No reason.Blake elbowed Harrison before he could reply.Lenny rolled her eyes, Just dont get into any trouble.She moved toward the door, Cmon, let's go see who is here before I have get to work.They hung out in the VIP lounge for a couple hours, rubbing shoulders with sportscasters, celebrities and the best athletes in the world.The band knew a lot of the people there and it was sort of a mini reunion.They visited with other artists who also happened to be fans of the X Games and made fast friends of those they didnt already know.Nearly everyone was surprised to see Lenny, she had been notably absent in the last two years.She was hugged and high fived and congratulated on returning to the sport.She downplayed the accolades and didnt really explain the reason for her attendance.Her first interview only wanted her to talk about how exciting the Games were so far and who she thought would do the best today.She smiled and answered honestly, complimenting all the talent that she had witnessed so far.Fans had started to gather around the media tent, her appearance causing a stir.When the interviewer announced Lenny was heading to the autograph booth next, the crowd moved in a wave that direction.Lenny always like this part, she enjoyed talking to fans and taking pictures with them.Especially the kids.She signed photos and passed them to fans, deflecting questions about her return to the sport.Some people had her sign their equipment or had even brought posters from home.She was more than happy to accommodate them all, posing for pictures and giving hugs.Afterward, she headed back to the VIP lounge to see her friends.All of them were busy enjoying themselves and she felt good about that.Lenny had been worried they might not fit it but realized that was a ridiculous assumption.They fit in anywhere.Luke approached her, looking bothered.She frowned at his worried expression.Whats up?She asked him, wondering when they would ever have a quiet moment alone together again.I just talked to a guy fromI dont know, some sports thing.And he said that your next interview will have Shane there.He eyed her warily.Lennys stomach gurgled uncomfortably.She knew she would have to deal with him eventually so this wasnt that big of a surprise.She just didnt want to do it on national television.Typical Shane, still trying to intimidate her into shutting up.She wouldn't be surprised if he had arranged it like this, he loved attention.Im glad you told me.Lenny smirked.That wouldve been a shock.Maybe you can get out of it.Fake food poisoning or something.Luke was trying to be helpful but Lenny knew this was something she needed to do.She was angry with Shane for what he'd done.Her fire was back and she was looking forward to giving Shane a good burn.No.She shook her head at Luke's suggestion.Thanks.But I think I got this.She turned on her heel and strode back to the media tents, prepared to give the interview of a lifetime.It was long ago and far away, but for Lenny, the memory crept back to her most vividly.She had been fourteen when she had first lain on eyes on the smoldering hunk of athleticism that was Shane Brookings.He was four years her senior, but had dominated the half pipe circuit for the better part of his short career.Tall, with wide, strong shoulders and rippling muscles, he looked too large to be so agile on a snowboard, yet he moved with a seductive fluidity.His strength carrying him to record breaking heights and crossing boundaries of flight.His square jaw and perfectly unshaven stubble gave him a roguish appearance that made girls swoon.Lenny made it her purpose to show up on his radar.It took a few years, she was just a kid to him in the beginning, but after her trip to the back country of Alaska she gained a little more media attention, and Shane took notice.They flirted off and on for a couple of years, creating speculation in the sports world about them having super beautiful athletic babies.And then one day it happened.Shane decided he had to have her.Looking back, Lenny realized there were several warning signs.Shane was always way into his own body, constantly working out and taking offers to pose half naked for whatever magazine wanted him.He would flirt shamelessly with every pretty girl who walked by; Lenny wrote it off to him having an outgoing personality.Just a few weeks into them dating and Shane started to get weirdly controlling about who Lenny could and could not talk to.She got an offer from Sports Illustrated to be in their swimsuit issue and Shane had pitched a fit.She turned it down to appease him but then Cody had swooped in and taken the gig.Lenny should have caught on right away.But shed never been in a relationship so she really had nothing to compare it to.Lenny knew it was unusual by the worlds standards to be a twenty three year old virgin, but shed been busy having a life and never really thought about having sex.It was there, in the back of her mind, she just assumed that when it was time she would know.Completely confident in every decision shed made in her life thus far, it was normal for her.So when Shane had started to pressure her into having sex the night before the biggest run in her career, Lenny balked at the idea.No, Im not ready for that step.And besides, I dont want a big distraction in my head for tomorrow.They were sitting in her room, a small dorm sized bedroom with two sets of bunks.She and Cody were roommates with two other girls who had recently left because they had won their medals and wanted to go home.Shane had started to make more frequent visits to her room to make out.Cmon, itll make you do even better tomorrow.He whispered in her ear as his hand traveled from her knee up her thigh.Lenny shoved his hand away and stood up.She was not liking this side of Shane at all.Theres no way for you to know that.She frowned.I dont want to, its not a discussion.Shane put on his best puppy dog face, trying again.Please, baby, youre just so hot I can hardly keep my hands off you.He stood up and pulled her close against his body.I want you so bad and I love you so much.He started kissing her neck.Lenny shoved him away from her.Knock it off.Im serious, Shane.She crossed her arms and her frown deepened.This isnt happening.Shane's face shifted to affronted and he put his hands on his hips, scowling at Lenny.She stood firm, not sure what to expect.What the hell, Lenny?Whats your problem?He barked, all sweetness leaving him.Lenny narrowed her eyes.Im pretty sure Im not the one with the problem.She grabbed her jacket and slipped it on.Where are you going?He demanded, grabbing a hold of her arm.She twisted free as she yanked open the door.To get some fresh air, I suggest you do the same.She left in a huff, slamming the door behind her.Lenny stalked though the Village, calming down quickly.She ran into a few Olympians she had just met that week and they invited her to join them for their evening activities.She relaxed in the fun atmosphere watching other events and competitors.She was feeling in a much better mood when she went back to her room to get rested before her own run the next day.She opened the door and stopped in her tracks.Her voice stuck in her chest as her eyes that never missed anything viewed the heart wrenching scene before her.Cody's toned and tanned body was only in a bra and panties and she was hastily yanking a shirt over her head.Shane was in his boxers and pulling his jeans up.Their faces were flushed and they were still breathing heavy.They must have justfinished Lenny felt her stomach turn as her brain tried to wrap around this blatant betrayal.She finally found her voice.It sounded strange and angry in her own ears.She wondered what it sounded like to them.You have got to be kidding me.She stood still in the doorway, not wanting to enter the room and have to feel the remnants of their recent passions.What did you expect?Cody glared at her, running her fingers through her caramel colored tresses to smooth out the tousle they'd just been through.Youre such an effing tease.Im just glad I could be there to fill in.Didnt come in second this time.She said smugly.Lennys eyes widened at her friend's words.Youre not seriously suggesting that this is okay?Calm down, Lenny.Dont make a big deal out of this.Shane spoke to her like she was child as he pulled his shirt over his head.Dont make a big deal?Are you serious?Her voice was starting to get louder and people walking by in the hallway were taking notice.A small crowd started to gather a few feet away, listening in.I needed a release, I gave you first dibs, and you declined.I found it somewhere else.You shouldnt be mad about this.This is what you wanted, isn't it?Shane taunted.Youre an asshole!Was all Lenny could get out.She was losing her resolve and starting to crumble.She couldnt believe what they had just done but what was even harder to swallow is that they were defending themselves.I told Shane that you guys would probably never have sex.Cody said haughtily.That you have a hard time showing love.That youre broken.She let her words dig in.But dont worry friend, I'm always happy to help out.Lenny was going to be sick.She could feel the bile rising in her esophagus and swallowed hard to push it down.It didnt work; she ran to the bathroom a short distance down the hall, locked the door behind her, and wretched into the toilet.Then she sat down on the floor and cried.It had always been hard for Lenny to make friends.With three older brothers she had gotten along with guys better.Girls tended to not like her.It didnt bother her too much, she had always had Cody.But nowTears ran down her face, uncontrolled.She had never felt so alone in her life.Her family wasnt allowed in the Village and Duke was on an expedition and couldnt be reached.She had no one.Their words had done more than stung.Lenny had always feared in the back of her mind that maybe romantic love wasnt something in her future.What if Cody was right?What if she was broken?That week had been the worst of Lennys whole life.She crashed the next day, allowing Cody to take gold and propel her into superstardom.The recovery from the accident had been slow.Shane and Cody kept coming around, trying to see if she remembered what they had done.Apparently they werent feeling as secure in their lusty decisions after the fact.Lennys confidence was sapped.She couldnt even rely on her own body to take her where she wanted to go.She decided to focus on recovery, hoping Cody and Shane would tire of the daily torture and leave her alone.As she made progress, Shane used her accident as another way to be in the spotlight.He was constantly giving interviews about her well being and their future together.It didnt take too many weeks of that before Lenny understood why he was in a relationship with her in the first place.It looked good.It made him look even more attractive, he was using her to stay visible.No appeal remained for her to return to snowboarding.Two years flew by.Shane moved to Wyoming, he wanted to move into the Lodge but his condition was that Duke move out.Lenny declined that idea.She was getting so tired of him.Getting sick of all the fake I love yous and empty gestures.She could feel herself growing colder and more distant with everyone around her.Her atmosphere was suffocating her and she started to fear she would die if she didnt leave.Snowboarding was more than a sport for Lenny.It had been an extension of herself.It offered a freedom that other sports lacked.Her brothers said that it was her rebellious nature finding a home.It made her feel limitless and challenged.She hated the rules and propriety of growing up in an upper class family.Snowboarding gave her an outlet, a way to express love, rage, passion and grief.The mountain had been her canvas, the board her brush.Losing her confidence in that had been devastating.She was afraid that she would never feel at peace with herself again.Not anymore.She was back, and her nonconformity had been stifled for too long.She had some catching up to do.Lenny smirked to herself as she entered the media tent, instantly drawing attention to herself.She smiled politely at the staff, shaking hands and exchanging greetings.A little gal came over and fitted her with a mic and showed her which chair to sit in.Wow, youre even pretty up close.The girl giggled nervously, Lenny just smiled, remembering how graciously the guys dealt with the attention they received wherever they went and aimed to appear as comfortable as they always did.She sat in the chair she was directed to and Brad, the interviewer, engaged her in small talk while they waited for Shane.She and Brad had been on good terms since she had started to gain attention in her early teens.He was apprised of all her success and failures and knew her family relatively well, too.That was the thing about sportscasters, they stuck around the industry for a long time and made friends.It gave them better interviews.Theres been quite a bit of pressure on me to ask you some hard questions ever since it was announced you were going to be here.Brad said, testing Lennys reaction.You can ask me anything you want, Brad.Lenny replied with a sincere smile, hoping he'd get the hint.Brads eyebrows went up at the open door invitation.Normally, a celebrity such as Lenny would have limits or guidelines set up at the beginning of the interview.He smiled with intrigue at her unflinching response.Lennys attention was drawn to the flurry of activity coming towards her.Shane Brookings entered the tent and flashed everyone his dazzling smile.The mic girl got so flustered she forgot her job and blushed a deep maroon.Lenny hadnt seen Shane since the day before she'd had her interview with Carl.He looked good.Not great, but good.He approached Lenny and Brad and coolly took his seat.He had kept his dark hair trimmed short and had grown a nice goatee that showed off his angular jaw.He was tall, well over six feet, his large, muscular frame engulfing the chair he sat in.His eyes were pools of amber that glinted in the sunlight that peeked through the seams of the tent.I wasnt sure youd show.He raised an eyebrow at Lenny, obviously surprised to see her.Lenny didnt reply, she just smiled politely and faced Brad.So lets begin, Brad got the ball rolling, turning to speak into the camera.Today at the Winter X Games we have snowboardings elite, the sweethearts of the sport.Lenny Evans, eight time X Games gold medalist, once the darling of big mountain riding and Shane Brookings, reigning World Champion in the Half Pipe and current Olympic gold medalist.Also, snowboardings most eligible bachelor.The world thought you two were going to get married and ride off into the sunset on Burtons newest design but that hasnt happened.How long since youve seen each other?She left me about six months ago.Shane answered quickly, not looking in Lennys direction.Thats true, I did.Lenny nodded, keeping her face flat.Have you left the sport entirely?Brad directed at Lenny.I thought I had, but I may be making a comeback.She smiled coyly.She noticed Shane tense up next to her.So did Brad.What do you think about that, Shane?I thinkthats a pretty big decision and she should probably take it easy.He chuckled nervously.I mean, she had a pretty major wreck, it might take a while for her to get back to the level she was at.Oh, Im just as good as I always was.Lenny answered, relaxed and confident, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.Is that why you guys decided to call it quits, difference of opinion?Brad questioned, his eyebrows bobbing up and down.Yeah, sort of, Lenny answered before Shane could.I shouldve ended it years ago.He had the opinion that it was okay to sleep with my best friend and my opinion was that it was wrong.She was laying the sarcasm on pretty thick and saw Brad swallow his grin.She looked to Shane to voice his opinion on the matter; he was obviously blindsided.He started stuttering, trying to come up with something to counter Lennys words.But nothing would come out.Is that true?Brad asked Shane.Shane couldnt answer; he just stared at the ground.There was speculation at the time of your wreck that you were distraught before approaching the chute.Brad, realizing that Shane was worthless at this point, pointed back to Lenny.Yeah, I had just caught them a few hours prior.In my room.She heard a collective gasp around the tent.When you say them you mean Brad prodded, a light sheen of sweat was becoming visible by his hairline and Lenny knew she was standing on the edge of acceptable interview protocol.She could practically hear Patrick the lawyer reading her retraction statement to the press now.He'd probably cite exhaustion or something.Shane and my best friend at the time, Cody Carmichael.Lenny heard a screech from somewhere off camera but she didnt let it distract her.That mustve been pretty awful.Brad prodded Lenny to elaborate.You know, it really was.The worst part was how they made me feel less than myself.It took me some time to really come to terms with that.She glanced sideways at Shane but he was still mute and paralyzed.Shane has been acting like you were the one who broke his heart.Brad was trying to get Shane to react to something, anything.Weird, right?Lenny made a face and Brad couldnt stop himself from laughing.I feel bad for all the girls hes ever suckered into believing his sob story just so he can get pity sex.Cmon, Lenny.Shane had suddenly come back to life.We dont have to do this here.Lets go talk somewhere in private.Lenny ignored him and kept her focus on Brad.So you think you might be coming back to the sport in a full time capacity?Brad asked, putting every ounce of professionalism into his voice as he could muster.I havent made any decisions yet.But its something I am considering.Lenny answered with a smirk.Im still damn good.Think you could win a medal in two years?Brad speculated.If youre asking if I think Im better than the gold medal defender, Cody Carmichael, then Lenny lifted her chin in defiance as she answered.Yes.I am better than her, in a lot of ways.Shane, completely humiliated, yanked off his mic and stormed out of the tent.Lenny smile apologetically at Brad.So, all good news here today.Brad turned to look into the camera.Lenny Evans is considering making a return to snowboarding in time for the Winter Olympics and if todays interview is any indication of her passion, the rest of the world better start paying attention.The red light on the camera went off and Lenny got up to leave.Brad stopped her and shook her hand.Its good to have you back, Lenny, Brad said sincerely.And if you want to trash any other ex boyfriends on TV please call me first.Okay, will do, Lenny laughed.Luke greeted her in the VIP tent with a huge hug.That was amazing.Luke was positively beaming.You dont think it was a little over the top?Lenny asked with a touch of anxiety.Sure, it felt good at the time but she was aware there could be significant fallout.Are you kidding me?I make my living by being over the top.I am the foremost expert on what over the top is.He smiled at her again.You were completely within reason.Thanks.She breathed a little sigh of relief.She had dealt with Shane, now she would have to deal with Cody.Lenny knew there would be trouble after she labeled her as the whorey, second rate best friend.I think Blake and Sway were a little disappointed they didnt get to talk to Shane first.Luke said as he directed her back to the hotel.Oh, is that right?Lenny laughed.What did they think they were gonna do, rough him up?She laughed again at the idea.She allowed Luke to lead her back to his room without really thinking about it.He slid the key card into the door and let her inside.His room was smaller than hers.Just one bed and a bathroom.You and Mike sharing the King size?Lenny joked.No, I got my room to myself for the first time ina while.He finished slowly.I bet thats gotta be nice.Lenny smiled and slipped off her hoodie, revealing a white tank underneath.She sat down on the bed, playfully bouncing a little.She watched Luke take off his outerwear.She hadnt really looked at him yet since theyd arrived.He was so fit and lean, his muscles flexed and moved under his skin and were clearly visible beneath his shirt.His tattoos peeked out from under his long sleeves as he pushed them up and sat down on the chair.His blonde hair was a little longer than when they had first met, she noted as he raked it back off his face with his fingers.He had grown a short beard that only defined his chiseled features even more.His crystal blue eyes were crinkled at the sides, as if in perpetual smile.Her stomach did a back flip.Luke Casey could still take her breath away.She wasnt sure what to say so she waited in the silence.Hoping Luke would speak.After several minutes, Luke turned his terrible blue eyes on Lenny.Those eyes that had the power to make her heart stop.Im here for you this week.Not the events, not the celebrities, not the weather.Just you.Whatever you need from me, you have it.Lenny bit the inside of her cheek.She had been keeping him at a distance and yet here he was, offering more for her to misuse if thats what she chose.Her heart beat fast as she began to grasp his unrestricted devotion to her.It was a lot stronger than she had realized.I just got my head back on Lenny started slowly, she didnt want to hurt Luke but she wanted to be honest with him.Im sort of just starting to feel comfortable in my own skin.
