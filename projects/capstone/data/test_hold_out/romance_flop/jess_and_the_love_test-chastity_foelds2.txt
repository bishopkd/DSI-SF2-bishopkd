You know thats not true.It had been years since Jess thought of Anthony and her as lovebirds.And by the time Jess stopped thinking that way, it had probably been years, if ever, that Anthony had thought of them that way.Jess knew Anthony thought of her, when he thought of her at all, as HIS WOMAN nothing more.Isabella is right my husband is a caveman.So whens the last time you two had sex?Isabella asked.Hey!Jess said, so loud that Manolo lifted his head.Dont talk like that.Words like that really!Manolo put his head back to his work.Isabella was too free with words like sex.Jess couldnt remember the last time shed used that word herself.Even then it was probably to do a school assignment.And Jess had graduated high school two decades ago.Sorry, Isabella said, grinning.Whens the last time you guys did the nasty?Bumped uglies?Made the beast with two backs?Danced the sweaty naked tango?Played randy pirate and willing wench?Jess slapped at Isabellas fleshy shoulder.Cut it out!Now, I mean it.Jesss face grew red, but she did start to giggle uncontrollably.Okay, I get it, Isabella said.A long time.Jess pulled off her sunglasses, and her eyes cried out for help.Is it that obvious?Yes.Great, Jess said.What would you say if I told you I could fix all that?Isabella asked, a glint in her eye.2   Two days later, Isabella and Jess stood in Jesss garage, looking over Anthonys F350.Jess had no idea what the technical definition of a monster truck was, but Anthonys truck sure seemed to qualify.Like her husband, it was big larger than life.And when the engine roared, just like her husband, it could not be ignored.Jess knew for a fact there were construction workers, men who hauled iron girders by hand, that hunkered down and tried not to do anything that might draw Anthonys attention when they heard his truck rumble their way.Jess could still remember in vivid detail, even though it was years ago, the one time shed seen Anthony tune a guy up.Thats what he called it: tuning a guy up.Jess supposed that went down better than the truth: assault.Anthony wasnt the type of man who felt the necessity of niceties, so Jess assumed the euphemism was for her benefit.Of course, that was back when Anthony used to take Jesss feelings into consideration.Like Jesss ability to be naked with the lights on, those days were long gone.The truck sat in the garage, taking up the whole bay.So how will this work?Jess asked.Simple, Isabella said.My friend installs a circuit board under the dash, completely out of sight, and whenever Anthony plays his trucks radio, no matter what hes listening to, a subliminal message will come out of the speakers along with his station.Who will install it?Your friend?Jess asked, her eyebrows arched.Isabella had lots of friends.Fine, Isabella replied, adopting a faux haughty air.My LOVER.She let that last word linger in the air.God, shes incorrigible.But so free and relaxed.Oooh, Jess squealed.Dont say it like that.You make it even tawdrier, if thats possible.Does Bill know?My husband?Isabella replied.Of course he does.He encourages it.Bill wants me to be happy.Jess spotted Isabellas eyes dart to the floor.Jess poked Isabellas black tee between her low hanging strands of beads.Wait a minute, Jess said.Youre holding something back.You little fibber de libber.Youre holding something back.Maybe, Isabella said.Hey, watch the beads.Jess pulled her finger away and crossed her arms.Isabella Sheffield, tell me your secret right now.Well, gee, Mrs.
