Did you really not know?No!Jess blew her nose into her sodden tissue.It was about to fall apart.And your stupid hypnotic circuit board isnt working.Its been two weeks, and he still doesnt kiss me!Isabella stroked her chin, thought for a bit, and then said, Two weeks is long enough.Have you used the trigger?Jess finally looked straight at her friend.Trigger?What trigger?Oh, honey, I surely told you about the trigger.You need to scent the air to smell like lilacs.Hell get oral with you then.He wont be able not to.Jess poured herself some lemonade.Not that she was thirsty, but she needed something to do with her hands.You didnt tell me about the trigger.Isabella looked up at the glaring sun, and then down at Manolos tan shoulders.I thought I did, but anyway, thats what you need to do.Okay, Ill try it.But I dont see the point now, Jess confessed.Isabella rooted around in her tote bag.She pulled out a pocket video camera.It was digital, and needed no tape, so it was very small.Isabella shot some video of Manolo as he worked.What are you doing?Jess asked.Oh, hes so good looking, Isabella replied.I love to record good looking men, even if they are gay.Jess grabbed the video camera from Isabellas hand and put it down on the table.Cut it out.Hes not gay, and I call dibs.Okay, honey, Isabella said.Im sorry.Some habits are hard to break.Speaking of bad habits, why are you going to do with your no good cheating husband?I know a good divorce lawyer.Divorce?Hah!Mafia wives didnt get divorced.Sure, Mary Barone left her husband, but she had kept a file on Bruno, her husband.Mary Barone had recorded her husband talking about heroine deals and a murder.Anthony never discussed his business.Divorce was not an option.Jess was trapped.No, Jess said.Maybe if I use the lilac trigger, hell mend his ways.How do I know this Love Test works, anyway?If he starts kissing me, does that mean it worked?Isabella shook her head.No, Im afraid not.Hell get oral, if it works, but the gist of my plan is that this will re spark his interest in you.You know, prime the pump, and hell only be interested in you.If he gets oral but still acts like an ass, then youll know its over.Jess watched Manolo move the vacuum equipment to the deep end of the pool.Manolo moved with a physical grace that Jess found entrancing.It doesnt sound like the best test, if you ask me, Jess said.Sorry honey, Isabella replied.Its the best Ive got.The two friends moved the conversation to chitchat, and spent the afternoon watching Manolo and drinking lemonade.It was obvious, after a while, that Manolo knew he was being watched.Soon after Manolo finished, put his equipment in his truck, and drove away, Isabella left too.When Jess was cleaning up, she noticed Isabellas pocket video recorder was still on the patio table.Jess picked it up, and brought it to her bedroom, where she put it in her lingerie drawer.Then she went out to purchase some lilac scented candles.5   Anthony was working late that day, but he had no plans to go out after dinner.Jess set about making his favoriteLinguini Alfredo and also managed to bake a cherry pie.Anthony loved cherry pie.The dining room table had a bouquet of flowers, lilacs and dragons breath, that Jess had bought while she was out getting the candles.Shortly after seven oclock, Anthony came barreling into the kitchen.Once again, Jess had to remind him to take off his construction boots.Every time.He cant break bad habits.This is not going to work.Busy day?Jess asked after they sat down to eat.The usual, Anthony replied, his mouth full of pasta.Whats with the flowers?
