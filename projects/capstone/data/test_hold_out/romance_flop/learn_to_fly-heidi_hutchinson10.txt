They didnt need convincing.Shane waited in his room long enough for the others to think hed gone to bed and then he stepped into the hallway.He paused, waiting to see if Luke would notice his presence.If he did, it wasnt obvious.Luke was more exhausted then Shane had first noticed.His clothes were wrinkled and unwashed.His eyes were sunk in and dark from days, possibly weeks, without sleep.He hadnt shaved either.Shane wondered when he had eaten last.He made his way slowly towards the singer and took a seat next to him on the floor.I dont want to fight with you, Brookings.Luke said roughly.His eyes heavy with fatigue and discouragement.Thats not why Im here.Shane answered flatly.He clenched his jaw.Being a dick was so much easier, but Shane wanted to be a better person.How he hated himself right now.They sat in silence for a while, the ice maker down the hall and a movie with explosions in the room behind them, the only noise.She hasnt slept with me.Shane said, his voice echoing in the silence.He felt an indescribable need to defend Lennys honor.Maybe because he had been the one to ruin her in the past, it would be a way of making amends.Shane wasnt sure.He didnt particularly like Luke Casey but he knew Lenny cared for him.And that was important to Shane.I know, Luke sighed in frustration.Then, why did you?Shanes voice trailed off.I was mad.And I still dont know why youre here.Luke threw a small glare in Shanes direction.Shane shrugged.Luke had a point.It did look suspicious at first glance.Im not after your girl, Shane declared.Luke hmphed and leaned his head back, looking up at the ceiling.What makes you think shes still my girl?He asked the ceiling more than Shane.Shane considered his words carefully before saying them.Ive known Lenny a long time, he began slowly, And shes never slapped anyone.Kicked the crap out a couple of guys and has definitely thrown some punches but never slapped.And that helps me how?Luke let out a disgruntled chuckle.I thinkyou have to care really deeply for someone to let them get to you that much.Shane shook his head and looked into his lap.She never even fought with me.Luke frowned and looked over at Shane.Never?Nope.Shed just shut herself off or leave town for a while.I guess I always knew I wasnt worth her time.So, youre saying the slap is a good thing?Luke asked skeptically.Yeah, thats what Im saying.Shanes serious face cracked a smile.But thats Lenny for ya, when she loves, she goes all in.Luke swallowed hard.He missed her.He wanted to start pounding on her door and demand to work this out.But he thought she might be sleeping and he didnt want to disturb her.She had looked so tired.Did you really get a tattoo of her name on your arm?Luke suddenly asked.Ha, yeah.You wanna see it?Shane pulled up his sleeve to reveal his perfectly sculpted bicep and a simple script:  Free Bird  Why did you do that?Luke asked.What can I say, Im a lifelong fan.Shane shrugged and smiled, lowering his sleeve.Get some sleep, man.Shane started to stand up.If this storm breaks tomorrow, shes gonna head for the highest peak.He raised an eyebrow, You ready to chase her?Luke gave a crooked grin through his weariness as an answer.Ill think Ill sleep out herejust in case.Shane nodded and headed back to his room.He grabbed a couple of the extra pillows and a blanket and brought it to Luke in the hallway.Luke nodded his thanks and Shane left it at that.He hoped that Luke could put things right.He wasnt a bad guy, hed just made some piss poor choices.Shane had been there.But Lenny had forgiven Shane, so she would probably forgive Luke as well.Hopefully, sooner rather than later.Those two belonged together.23    Get Around This      Lennys growling stomach is what woke her up.She was starving.Her first thought was for pancakes.Her second thought was Luke.She crept to the door to look out the peep hole and held her breath.What if he wasnt there?What if he had left while things were still ugly between them?Lenny let the air out of her lungs as she observed Lukes slumped over figure in the hallway.He looked pitiful.Hed tried to stay propped up but had nodded off sometime in the night and was slouched, painfully crooked.Lennys heart squeezed inside of her chest.What kind of a man would sleep outside of the door of the girl who had publicly chastised him and then slapped him?Luke Casey was that kind of man.Lenny went to the bathroom and rushed through her routine.She shook her head to herself as she contemplated what her next move should be.She couldnt see a way out of talking to him.He obviously wasnt going to leave until she did.She brushed her teeth and pulled her silky hair into a loose ponytail at the nape of her neck.She looked down at her pajamas and decided she didnt want look like a total mess.She tried to find something clean to wear amongst her pile of dirty clothing.Settling on some well worn jeans and her black, lace back riding tank, Lenny quickly changed.She slipped on some thick socks and laced up her boots.She grabbed a black and white flannel from off the floor and shoved her arms through the sleeves, not bothering to button it up.She closed her eyes to steady her breathing before opening the door.She pulled it open quietly and slowly stepped into the hall.Luke didnt stir.She looked up and down the hall but didnt hear any other activity aside from the small click of her door closing behind her.It was still early, the rest of the group would probably be asleep for at least another hour.Lenny looked down at Luke and noticed his appearance for the first time.She had been so upset with him the night before that she didnt see the circles and puffiness under his eyes.But he was still as handsome as she remembered, his long hair nearly to his shoulders and partially covering his face..She knelt down next to him and readjusted his pillow.Lukes eyes opened slightly and then closed again.Lenny gently touched his face, brushing his hair away.His eyes opened again and fixed on her.Lenny smiled slightly as his brain caught up with his vision.Lenny?His voice croaked.What are you doing sleeping in the hallway?She asked softly.Luke pushed himself into a sitting position and tried to reorient himself.He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and looked at his surroundings.His vision came to rest on Lenny and he looked her up and down, finally settling on her face.She tried to work the moisture back into her mouth, suddenly at a loss for words under the scrutiny of his crystal blue eyes.Her anger from the previous evening momentarily forgotten in his larger than life presence.You wanna get some breakfast?She couldnt think of anything else to say.She knew they needed to talk but she didnt know where to start and she didnt want to be in the hallway when the others started to rise from their comas.Luke nodded once and got into a standing position.He gathered his pillows and blanket and silently deposited them in his room.He disappeared for a few minutes, leaving Lenny in the hallway.Just when she was afraid he wasnt coming back, he reemerged, his face washed and breath fresh.His eyes brightened when he looked at her, or did she imagine that?They didnt speak as they got on the elevator and walked to the small caf that was part of the hotel.The hostess seated them and they sat silently, staring at their menus.Lenny couldnt help but feel incredibly awkward.Maybe this was a bad idea.She looked sideways out the windows and silently cursed the continuing blizzard.She wanted nothing more than to run out into the swirling snow and disappear from the uncomfortable conversation they had yet to begin.The waitress came and got their order and then left them to sit in their silence again.Luke shifted in his seat and finally leaned against the table, putting his elbows on the top and resting his chin in his hands.I'm sorry about the thing with the girl in the bar.It was stupid and I have no excuse.His normally smiling eyes were tired and forlorn.Luke  Lenny started, closing her eyes.Not anticipating the pain that would accompany the strangeness of his apology.I don't have a right to ask for anymore chances or even for forgiveness.He slid his hand across the table and tentatively touched the top of her fingertips.Lenny sighed heavily.He didn't understand, how could he?I'm also sorry about releasing your song.You were right.It was special, I should have kept it special.Lukes mouth turned up on one side slightly.Thats what I get for listening to Sway.You took relationship advice from Sway?Lenny asked, aghast.He has a girlfriend now, Luke defended.No way.Lenny smiled suddenly and Luke grinned in response.I miss those guys, she added quietly.Then come back, Luke pleaded frankly.Luke, you know that wouldnt be a good idea.Lenny swallowed the lump that rose in her throat.He wasnt going to make this easy on her, was he?Why?Luke asked, covering her hand with his.Were great together.Why is this such a bad idea?Lennys skin awakened when his hand grabbed hers and she got mad at herself inwardly for having such a reaction.If she was going to explain this to him than she need to keep her wits about her.Did you not notice the epic fight we had last night?Lenny looked at him earnestly.Being on tour put us in a kind of bubble.It protected us from reality.When I first left, I thought that maybe I was making a mistake because I missed you so bad but...she looked out the window and shook her head.Seeing you in those pictures hurt more than I thought possible.Our relationship doesnt translate into our regular lives.She pulled her hand away from his and took a sip of water.If you think about it, I think youll see it too.Luke looked down at the table.His shoulders slowly sagged into a defeated posture and Lenny thought that maybe she had reached him after all.Maybe he could see what she could see.Their food came and they ate silently.Luke wouldnt look at her and Lenny felt like she was leaving him all over again.Why had he come to Alaska?What purpose did this serve?He was obviously moving on back in Boston.The pictures flashed into Lennys mind again and she visibly shuttered, getting Lukes attention.Something wrong with your food?He asked, concerned.No, Lenny took a drink of water, Just an unpleasant memory.Luke nodded and went back to his meal.Hey, guys.Nick approached their table cautiously.Nick, Lenny greeted and nodded at Luke, This is Luke Casey, Luke this is Nick Federa.He runs the place up in Thompson Pass.Yeah, we met briefly last night.Nick offered his hand and Luke shook it.The storm should clear out by today, Nick was addressing Lenny again, We should be able to go back to the cabins by tomorrow.Nick must have noticed the tension at the table but he decided to add an invitation to Luke, Youre more than welcome to join us, if you want.Luke probably wont be staying.Lenny interjected before Luke could answer.Nick shrugged and then moved to his own table where Smitty and Trucker were seated.Are you asking me to leave?Luke asked, his voice rough.Lenny looked up, seeing the rejection on his face and her heart sank.I just thought, it might be weird for you to stay sinceyou know.No, I dont know.Lukes eyebrows pulled in tight.Lenny mirrored his frown.He was more stubborn that she had anticipated.How could he not see the eminent devastation that was their relationship?I just meant, you might want to get back home, thats all.Luke lowered his glower to his plate of food and shoveled in the last few bites of omelet.He swirled the coffee in his cup, took a drink, and looked up at Lenny again.His face was resolved.Im staying, he said simply.Lennys mouth fell open but before she could protest, Luke stood up and pulled his wallet out of his back pocket.He tossed a couple of twenties onto the table, more than enough for both of their breakfasts.He pushed his face into her personal space, demanding eye contact.This, he pointed between himself and Lenny, his voice a dark whisper, isnt over.He held her eyes for a heartbeat longer than Lenny was comfortable with before he turned to leave.Lenny watched his back in silent frustration.Her face was warm from the intensity of Lukes final stare.Why was he making this harder than it had to be?What could be solved by his staying here?What was he possibly thinking?Luke had a plan.It wasnt the best plan that hed ever made but he finally had one.Lenny thought their relationship couldnt last in the real world.She thought he didn't care for as much as he did.His plan was to prove her wrong.And the best way to do that would be to join her in her world.Luke had been snowboarding recreationally since he was a kid.He wasnt the best but he was better than most.Duke had set him up with a bunch of gear before leaving Jackson Hole.He had all the equipment he would need to join the other seasoned riders for the remaining week.He just hoped it wouldnt take long for Lenny to figure out what he already had.They were meant to be together.He showered and dressed quickly, knowing he was going to have to permeate Lennys life in a way he never had before.He had to learn about her friends and colleagues.He had to dedicate himself to being her friend again.And when she was ready, she would let her guard down and Luke would swoop in and steal her heart.He was pulling his shirt over his head when he heard her come back from breakfast.He grabbed his coat and went to her door and knocked.He noticed her dumbfounded face when she opened the door.She stood there awkwardly for a few minutes until he spoke.Can I come in?He asked, trying to sound as platonic as possible.I was just leaving, actually.Lenny replied, eying him suspiciously.I have to get some of these clothes washed before tomorrow.Ill help you.Luke stepped into her room, ignoring her annoyed look and grabbed the couple of laundry bags she had filled.He turned to find her staring at him.Lets go, he prompted.Lenny hesitated before reluctantly opening the door to the hallway.She grabbed her coat and slipped it on.Luke did likewise and they traveled in complete silence from the hallway to the elevator and down the street to the laundry mat.Lenny self consciously sorted her clothes while Luke got change.She hadnt brought anything too embarrassing with her.Just the basics; jeans, t shirts, underwear, socks, a couple sweaters and some flannels.Luke came back and handed her a stack of quarters and she hurriedly started two loads at once.The sooner this was over with the better.As the washers began their cycles, Lenny took a seat and Luke joined her.She was decidedly uneasy.Lukes presence still had an overwhelming effect on her.She felt calm, relaxed, giddy even but that was coupled with the fear, dread and paranoia that everything was about to go terribly wrong.Luke could sense her tension and he got up and bought a couple of waters from the machine.He handed one to her and took his seat again.So, you get any good runs in since you been here?He tried to sound as casual as possible but his heart was racing.Being in such close proximity to Lenny was like being trapped in an open space with a tornado bearing down on him.Yeah, its been nonstop until this blasted storm.Lenny gestured to the snow that was starting to taper off but still heavy.Tell me about your favorite day.Luke saw her eyes light up and he was happy that she was feeling a bit more lenient to opening up to him.Luke paid attention to every detail.He asked for specifics and tried to memorize all the people that Lenny was close to.If he was going to gain her trust again, he was going to need to give it everything he had.He loved listening to her voice and how, when she was really excited about something, her smile was permanently crooked, making her talk out of the side of her mouth.Sometimes hed get distracted by the perfect shape of her lips and hed remember what it had been like to taste them.Hed have to pull himself back into reality.If he was ever going to get an opportunity like that again, he was going to have to earn it.Luke helped Lenny switch her loads to the dryer.She continued to tell him all about her week in Alaska.She recounted everything in vivid detail, using her photographic memory to the best of its ability.Sharing with Luke the adventure shed been on made it feel like he had been there with her.And for a moment, fleeting though it was, Lenny forgot about the tabloid gossip and pictures.She was simply sharing her life, turn by turn, with the one person she had wanted to be there all along.Luke hung on her words.Thankful for the time he could spend with her.At first, he had been jealous of the others who had gotten to share in the actual events of the week but her memory was so perfect and clear, he knew she wasnt leaving anything out.He had noticed this about her memory before and he had a hunch.Taking advantage of the relaxed and warm atmosphere of the laundry mat, Luke decided to ask her about it.Do you have a photographic memory?He didnt miss the subtle intake of breathe at his words.Ive just noticed that you never miss a detail.Luke was trying to sound complimentary.That obvious, huh?Lennys eyes turned down like she was embarrassed.Only to those who are paying attention.Luke touched her fingertips and she looked up at him.Yeah, I do, Lenny confessed with a sigh.Its my best kept secret.Duke is the only one who knowsand now you.Why do you keep it a secret?Luke asked gently.Im afraid they wont let me compete or people would be too afraid to get to know me.Lenny let her gaze drift to the outside world and her eyes unfocused.I guess, thats why I love the back country so much.Its unpredictable and it always surprises me.You like to be surprised?Lukes question held a subtle double meaning and Lenny didnt miss it.But instead of turning away from him she held his gaze.Some surprises are no fun at all, she answered simply.He knew she was referring to the pictures with the other woman.Luke cringed internally.Knowing her perfect memory now, he could see why that would be so hard to move past.Its not that she was choosing to remember it, she literally could not forget.He hated himself even more.I don't know if I can do this, Luke.Lenny blurted out.She ran a hand through her long hair nervously.Do what?He frowned, his heart flooding with panic.It's too weird.You showing up here after not calling me, making out with random girls and then our meltdown in front of my friends last night.She looked weary and sad.And you want to act like nothing has changed, act like we're friends and you can put the pieces back in places where you think they fit.But they just don't.Her brows pulled together as she tried to explain to him what he refused to accept as fact.I can't pretend like I'm okay.I'm not.I know I left, because I thought it was the right thing to do.But you let me go.You made it kind of obvious that you were fine with me being gone.I was the opposite of fine, Lenny.I was a mess.Luke calmly confessed.I realize that it might take some time to get back to where we were...but I'm not going anywhere.I think we can fix this...together.Before Lenny could answer, the dryers buzzed simultaneously causing her to jump up and begin putting her dry clothes on the folding table.Luke stood up slowly and joined her.Again in silence, they sorted and folded her clean laundry.Lenny was careful to make sure she folded all of her own bras and panties, not letting Luke even touch them.He found it amusing that she was so protective of her undergarments.He didnt get to see Lenny behave like a typical girl very often and he liked it.He finished folding a shirt and reached for another.He pulled a large blue t shirt from the pile and frowned.It looked familiar, and it was obviously a mans shirt.It clicked in an instant.It was his shirt.The one he had given her back when they were on tour.He glanced over at Lenny who hadnt yet noticed what he was holding and he couldnt help but smile.She had brought it with her.And it had ended up in the laundry which meant she had been wearing it.And that meant she still had feelings for him.He felt a sly smile tug at the corners of his mouth.She was totally in love with him.And he knew it.He was definitely not giving up now.Lenny saw Luke looking at her out of the corner of her eye and she glanced quickly in his direction.Seeing the shirt he was folding, her eyes went wide.She turned back to her task, maybe he didnt recognize it.So, you're still wearing my shirt?Luke sounded amused.Lenny grit her teeth and grabbed the shirt from him.She threw all her clothes back in the bags, not bothering to fold the rest.Cmon, Lenny, Lukes voice softened, I was just teasing.I know.Lenny answered flatly.Maybe I dont feel like being teased right now.Especially about that.She put on her coat and charged out the door.She heard him follow a few seconds later.When he caught up with her, he took the heavy bags from her hands and continued forward.She glared at the back of his head but she followed him anyway.In the elevator, Lukes eyes twinkled with mischief.Lenny kept her face straight, she refused to smile at him.Do you sleep in it?He asked suggestively.Lenny rolled her eyes, silently staring at the door of the lift.Luke laughed at her avoidance of the question.Outside of her door she fumbled with her key, clearly having been made uncomfortable by Lukes line of questions.Luke leaned against the door frame, watching her.Youre gorgeous, you know that?He said, oozing as much sensuality as his longtime experience as a rock star would allow.Lenny dropped her key on the floor and when she bent down to retrieve it, Luke put his hand on hers.She looked up into his penetrating gaze, their faces inches apart.He leaned in fractionally and Lenny bolted upright.She slid her key in the lock and quickly opened the door.Luke stood up and Lenny grabbed the bags from his hands, throwing them into her room.Thank you for your help with my laundry, Lenny said politely and then closed the door.She heard Luke chuckle softly from the other side and it irritated her.He knew what kind of power he held over her and it wasnt fair for him to use it against her like that.Luke knocked softly on the door.Ill just wait out here until youre hungry again.He joked playfully from the other side.Lenny paced in frustration.He had her there.She ate around the clock and there was no food in her room.Besides, she couldnt keep avoiding him.Especially if he was planning on coming with them tomorrow.The worst part was that she didnt want to avoid him.She had thoroughly enjoyed the entire day with him.He had been sweet and attentive and adorable.But, again, this was a bubble.As soon as real life got involved, it would go straight to hell.I was thinking pizza for lunch.Luke continued through the door.I saw a little place up the road that I wanted to try.Lenny couldnt help but smile.He was persistent, she would give him that.She had missed him so much.She found herself opening the door, against her better judgment.Luke was leaning against the frame and he gave her his most charming smile.Hungry?He asked coyly.She tried to hide her smile but she couldnt.She sighed and entered the hallway again, he fell in step beside her on the way back downstairs.Im assuming that youre paying?Lenny asked in the elevator.No way.The rule is, if I pay its officially a date, he winked at her, Unless this is date?Lennys heart skipped at his wink but she maintained composure.Nope, just friends.Ill pay for myself.She looked straight ahead, refusing to get sucked into his playful gaze.When they were seated in the booth at the small pizzeria, Lenny tried to relax again.Lukes presence was always unnerving but even more so now that he was completely hell bent on flirting with her.She couldn't deny that it felt good to have him there.Her body no longer felt like it was missing a vital organ.She glanced around and saw some of the people from her group at a different table.She shifted, as they openly gawked.The shouting match that had taken place in the hallway last night flashed in her mind.They looked confused and curious and she couldnt blame them.What was she thinking?Luke was going to be entering a hornets nest with this group.They would undoubtedly see him as the villain and ostracize him.This was a bad idea, Lenny said as she swirled the ice in her drink.Its okay, Lenny, Luke tried to get her eyes to meet his.I can take my lumps.Ill do whatever it takes to prove that to you and anyone else who cares.Lenny pursed her lips together.They both had separate agendas.She was trying to prove that they couldnt possibly work and he was trying to prove otherwise.What a fine pair they made.Luke saw a thousand emotions roll across Lennys face in an instant.She seemed to settle on casual indifference and Luke felt a new wave of regret course through his veins.He wondered if he hadnt have gone out that nightwould she have been this reserved now?How much distance did he put between them with his selfish choice?He missed the familiarity they used to have.Now, she was on guard, distrusting, reserved.He missed the way she would look at him and he knew she felt safe.Lenny cleared her throat and looked at him expectantly.Luke realized that she had asked him a question but he hadnt heard it.Im sorry, what?He asked apologetically.I said, when is your return flight?Lenny frowned at his faraway look.Uh, I dont have one.Luke answered uncomfortably.He saw the question on her face so he added.I bought a one way.The group of other riders finished their meal and gave curious glances as they departed.Shelby Lynn waved at Lenny shyly and then went outside.What was that all about?Luke asked.Oh, you havent heard?Im awesome.Lenny said saucily and laughed at her own bravado.I have, actually, heard that.And humble, too.Luke smiled at her.They were interrupted when Ben stepped over to their table.Were going bowling tonight.He openly glared at Luke, Nick said youre coming back up to the cabins with us tomorrow.Luke gave a curt nod and Ben continued, So you can join us tonight if you want.You make me feel so welcome, Luke said, impatience in his voice.Theyll be other girls there, you sure you can control yourself?Ben asked darkly.Ben!Lenny snapped, mortified by his behavior.Its okay, Lenny.Luke calmly stopped her and addressed Ben squarely.Look man, I made some bad choices.Im not making excuses for that.But I love this girl and Im not gonna give up just cause you spent half an hour coming up with an insult.He took a drink of his soda.Wed be happy to join you for bowling tonight.Lenny could see Ben was trying to think of something witty to reply with but came up empty.He grunted and left.Lennys head was swirling with a million thoughts.And they all centered around one thing.Luke had said that he was still in love with her.Luke went back to eating, completely unfazed.He looked up to see Lenny watching him with curious eyes.What?Do I got pizza on my face?He asked, making her smile.Nothing, Lenny replied but something had changed, infinitesimally in her eyes when she looked at him.He had no idea what he'd said in the past few seconds to propel any kind of change, but he was happy for it.The afternoon passed quickly.Lenny found herself getting excited for Luke to join them on the mountain tomorrow.She had wanted him to be a part of her life before, but the timing had been all off.She couldnt believe that he had bought a one way ticket to Alaska.She still felt a need to show him that a romantic relationship was impossible for them and probably a terrible idea.But he was making it hard.He flirted with her openly all day long.She did her best to ignore his comments and gestures, not wanting to encourage him.If he stood too close, she moved away.If he reached for her hand, shed put them in her pockets.Part of her was scared that her plan would work and hed give up, but he only tried harder.Finding new and clever ways to flirt and catch her off guard.At the bowling alley, the others tried their best to give Luke the cold shoulder but Lukes gregarious personality and authentic charm won them over pretty quickly.Even Ben, who held out the longest, was eventually high fiving Luke and buying him nachos.Damn, Lenny, Trucker complained.Youre kicking our asses!Is there anything youre not good at?Yes, Shane answered from behind her, Shes a terrible dancer.What!Lenny whirled to give him a glare but he just laughed.You are a horrible dancer, dont deny it.Shane handed her a soda.Luke was getting along with everyone so well that Lenny found herself unusually miffed.He was attentive and alert.He answered their questions but downplayed his rock star status.He joked around and looked genuinely at ease.He was freaking perfect.Dont be grumpy, Shane rebuked as he sat down beside her.Im not being grumpy, Lenny protested even though she knew he was right.You have a very effective frown but this is neither the time nor place.Shane reprimanded with a smile.Is it weird that hes getting along with everyone so well?Lenny shared her thoughts with Shane.No, whats weird is that youre avoiding him so obviously.Hey, you were on my side not twenty four hours ago.Lenny reminded him.Yep, Shane admitted.But then we had a bro talk.You what?Lennys slack jawed face caused Shane to burst out laughing.Yeah, Luke and I are bros now.Shane grinned at her.Lenny put her hand to her forehead in shame.My life is so weird, she muttered, making Shane laugh again.I think you should give him another chance, honestly.Shane added.Theres no another chance to give!Am I the only one who can see this as an impending disaster?Lennys tone was desperate but Shane laughed her off again.You forgave me, dont forget.Shane reminded.Whats your point?Lenny shot at him, irritated with his blas attitude.Well, I would think it would be easier to forgive Luke, Shane answered seriously, Youre in love with him.Lenny pursed her lips indignantly, I hate your face.Shane guffawed as Luke sat down on the other side of her.Whats going on over here?He asked, grabbing Lennys soda and taking a big drink.Nothing, Lenny answered quickly, giving Shane a warning glare.We were talking about how she needs to give you a one on one lesson on the slopes tomorrow.Shane winked at Lenny.Thats sounds sexy, Luke arched an eyebrow at Lenny.Yeah, it should be real hot with all the layers of clothing involved.Lenny answered dryly.She was not amused.How had both of her exes become best friends?You bunking with me tomorrow?Shane asked Luke.Thats what Nick said.Luke nodded, draining the last of Lenny's soda.Sweet, Shane fist bumped Luke and then headed to take his turn.Lenny gave Luke a look that made him laugh.What the hell is that all about?Lenny asked him.Shanes a good guy.Luke didnt give more of an explanation.When did this happen?Lenny was confused and annoyed at the same time.Last night.He brought me a pillow after you slapped me silly.Luke answered with a sly smile.I did not slap you silly.Lenny objected.And Im sorry about that, by the way.She added softly.You dont have to apologize, I deserved it.Luke nodded towards Shane, We have a lot in common.Oh yeah, like what?Lenny asked in disbelief.Well, we both have excellent taste in women.Luke smiled at her glare and got up to refill her soda.As the night continued on, Lenny found herself in conflict.Why was she pushing Luke away?To prove a point?Shane was right, she was in love with him and she didn't want him leave.She wanted him to stay.Nothing made sense anymore.Her previous resolve seemed so foolish and foreign with Luke's overwhelming presence all around her.When they made their way back to their rooms and turned in, anticipating the early departure tomorrow and the promise of fresh powder, Luke stalled outside Lennys door.Lenny unlocked her door but didnt go in right away.She paused, holding the door open with an arm, and looked up into Lukes hopeful expression.I had fun today, she said sincerely.Me too.Luke reached up and brushed a stray hair off her face.She didnt pull away this time.Luke wanted to kiss her.His eyes drifted to her lips and he stared at their perfect bow shape.But it was too soon.He still had work to do and kissing her right now wouldnt help.Instead, he touched her cheek with his palm and pressed his lips to the top of her forehead.Get some sleep, beautiful.He smiled down at her.You have to teach me how to fly tomorrow.Lenny smiled in return and went into her room, slowly closing the door behind her.She sat down on the edge of the bed in a daze.Oh no, she thought with dread, Im in way over my head.24    All In      The four day storm had covered Thompson Pass and the Chugach Mountains with a perfect, unblemished blanket of snow.It was pristine and lush; Lenny literally salivated when she beheld it.The drive up had been very different than the week before.This time, Lenny rode in the back of Nicks SUV with Luke and Serge.The atmosphere was cheerful and mild, probably due to the presence of the unshakable Norwegian.But it may have also been Lukes solid resolve from beside her.Lennys discontent had taken a backseat.She had awoken that morning feeling refreshed and alive.Knowing Luke was going to be there gave her soul a little boost.She didnt entirely know what that meant.She wasnt ready to just declare all forgiven and agree to move to Boston.But she would be lying if she said she hadnt thought about it more than once.Luke brought a peace out in her that no one else ever had.And it really wasnt anything he did.It was who she naturally became when then were together.Luke had finally gotten a good nights sleep.He hadnt rested since Lenny had left Boston.The first night in Alaska when he slept outside her door had been his first real sleep in weeks.Just knowing she was close by had been enough to allow him to doze off for a few hours.But after he had walked her to her door last night, he fell asleep before his head hit the pillow.Hed been so upside down without her, and having her around had finally righted him.Even if this was as close as they ever got, Luke knew without a doubt that they needed to be a part of each others lives.She was his best friend.And he was never taking that relationship for granted again.They quickly unloaded their gear into their cabins and then gathered by Nick for another rundown of basic avalanche survival training.Everyone except for Luke had already taken the training when they had first arrived but with the new snowfall, Nick wanted everyone to be refreshed before going out there.They all passed the basic tests without any problems.Nick reminded them that the mountains are unpredictable.Especially with the new powder, no one would be able to tell whats sturdy and whats soft until theyre in the middle of it.No pressure, guys, Nick spoke through his headset in the helicopter.Were just gonna go out and make a few turns.Lenny nodded when Nick glanced behind to make sure they had heard.She looked at Luke who was his usual, the most relaxed and confident person in the room.She had no idea how he could be so collected even when he was obviously out of his element.After the chopper had set them down and then took off again, Lenny pulled Luke off to the side.You dont have to do this, you know.She saw his eyes shift to the mountainside and then back to her.Yes, I do, Luke said calmly with a smile.Besides, if I get hurt, you can give me mouth to mouth.He laughed as she rolled her eyes.She feigned annoyance but the idea of her lips on his again made her heart stutter.And that annoyed her a little bit more.Why wasnt he taking this more seriously?You need to be a little scared, you know.Lennys concern was growing.I know.And I am.Totally terrified.Luke grinned at her again as Shane joined them.Ready to have your life change?Shane asked.Do your worst.Luke accepted the challenge.Lenny realized that she was the one who the most nervous about Luke riding.If anything happened to himHer stomach was full of butterflies as Shane gave Luke some pointers.This was a bad idea.Lenny shook her head and finally had to say something.No.Dont do that.Lenny stepped in between Shane and Luke.No offense, Shane.She said over her shoulder then back to Luke.Just take it slow.We can ride this hill all day.Dont worry about speed.She looked down at Lukes board and bindings and realized why they had looked so familiar.Do you have Dukes stuff?Yeah, he said I would need it.Luke looked at her sheepishly.So he had been to see Duke first.Was she really the only one who saw the ridiculousness of the situation?Well, hes not wrong.Duke always had the best stuff, Lenny conceded.She would have to address that Duke issue later.Just go slow for your first few turns and see how it feels.Wait till you can feel how the board responds.Were not racing.Luke put his hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eye.Hey, Im gonna be fine.I promise not to do anything stupid, he said reassuringly.She smiled, seeing the honesty in his face and tried to relax her back flipping insides.Cmon, Casey, Shane waved his arm and started on his run.Luke pulled his goggles down and joined him.Lenny held her breath as she watched them curve in and out and back and forth.Luke was good.He was actually very good.He kept up with Shane just fine and Lenny could tell he was a strong rider.His technique was a little shaking.But that can be cleared up with practice back home.Lenny muttered a curse under her breath for that thought.Luke was not coming home with her.She wasnt even surprised that Luke had been to see Duke.She figured he had either talked to Duke or Harrison because they were the only ones who knew she was in Alaska.She wished shed gotten a little more of a heads up though.Shed have to give Duke a hard time for that one.She was a little shocked that Duke had loaned his stuff to Luke.That was the equivalent of letting someone take your firstborn across the country.Duke never let anyone touch his stuff.Either Duke was getting soft in his old age or this was his version of giving Luke his blessing.Lenny suspected the latter.And that thought only added to her frustration.Her heart stumbled in conjunction with Luke's wipe out.He had been doing fine when he lost control and tumbled end over end.Shane had led him over a small lip and he caught air.He was clearly unprepared for it and he lost control before he'd even landed.Lenny didn't even wait for him to come to a complete stop.She was already flying that direction, her heart in her throat.She edged her board to a stop so fast, she could have had her own fall if she wouldn't have already disengaged her binders and was in near sprint across the snowy terrain.She threw off her goggles and hat and sank to her knees in the snow next to Luke's upturned figure.He was flat on his back, his arms outspread.She cleared the snow that had packed in around his face, her breath coming laboriously.Luke?She pushed his goggles up and stopped.His perfect blue eyes were looking at her with a bemused, almost whimsical expression.Were you worried?He asked, his mouth making a crooked grin.Lenny wanted to hug him and kick him at the same time.She bit her bottom lip and shook her head.Luke pushed himself into a sitting position and grinned at her.You came rushing to my side at the first sign of trouble.I've taken worse falls off the stage.He raised his eyebrows as if to make some point.I'm glad you're okay.Lenny finally said as she returned to her feet.She was blushing at her reaction to his mini wreck and she was glad he couldn't tell due to the cold air on her face.What if I would have gotten hurt?Luke asked as he disengaged his board and stood as well.He put his hands on his hips and looked at her with a cocky self assurance.Would you be sad?Lenny rolled her eyes and walked back to where she'd left her board near buried a short distance away.You woulda cried, I bet.Luke followed behind her.She smiled to herself, glad he couldn't see her reaction.The rest of the day went by smoothly.No injuries, no avalanches.Shane and Luke brought an energy to the group that hadnt been there the week before.They had bonded quickly and Luke was a complete natural on the mountain.Just like the night before when they were all bowling together, Luke was everyones best friend.He fit so perfectly in the group that Lenny was actually shaken up by it.Not in a scared waywell, maybe in a scared way.Had she been wrong this whole time?Was her fear of the oncoming heartache all in her head?Was she really the only one who could ruin this?They returned to base camp that night and Trucker and Smitty built a bonfire.The crew was still amped from an easy day on the slopes and they needed to expel a little of that extra energy.The fire burned tall and bright against the blackness of the Alaskan sky.Some people were roasting marshmallows, a few were drinking beers.Light conversation and laughter floated through the air.Lenny sat on a log near the fire, a little removed from the group.She stared into the orange glow and let her tense muscles relax with the buzzing of her friends voices nearby.So much had happened in the span of a few days.The emotional ups and downs had been hard to keep up with.And now, she had to get her head together and figure out what the next step was.She thought she had this all figured out when she had left Europe but it had hurt more than she had anticipated.She wasnt sure, that when push came to shove, she could willingly walk away from Luke again.Even if it was better for them both.It hurt too much.Luke sat down next to her on the log, pushing close against her side till she moved over so he had room.Did you have fun today?He asked her, pulling a charred marshmallow off of a stick.Yeah, did you?She asked giving him a small smile.She was desperately trying to keep an emotional barrier between them.Luke always made her question every single one of her rational thoughts.Luke popped the mallow into his mouth and grinned at her.She couldnt help but grin back, his happy smile was infectious.I always have the best day when its been a day with you.Luke said after he swallowed his mouthful a little more serious as he spoke.Her heart strangled in her chest.Thats exactly how she felt too.Lenny had always been extremely independent.Which is probably why shed chosen snowboarding as the first love of her life.It was free and wild, just like her.She loved her family and they had always supported her.But even they couldnt explain the side of Lenny that came out when she was shredding a gorgeous line.Traveling and boarding all over the world, she had gotten to meet some exceptional people.She never had a problem making friends but she hadnt truly made any deep connections.Not until she ran away with rock stars.Even now, without Mike, Blake, Harrison and Sway here, she felthomesick.Lukes close proximity only made that feeling stronger.She had tried, really tried, to keep her barrier intact.But those rowdy group of men had won over her heart.And one of them in particular held more of heart than she had consciously agreed to.She gave a sideways glance to Luke and tried not to stare at how the fire reflected in his pale blue eyes, making them glow even more intensely.The entire tour he hadnt so much as looked at another woman.Not that there werent any around.Women were constantly throwing themselves at the band.They would do horrible things to get attention.Shameful, self depreciating things.But the guys were professionals, and the tour had been clean and relatively easy.Thats what had been so shocking about the paparazzi photos of Luke with whoever that had been.It was so uncharacteristic of the Luke that she knew.But there it had been, in full, high definition color, the truth of what a life of fame often entailed.Lenny wasnt sure if she could live that life.Do you want a mallow?Luke asked her, reloading his stick.Um, sure.Lenny tried to pull her thoughts back to the present.Luke lit the marshmallow on fire and slowly turned the stick so it burned evenly all the way around.He presented the perfectly roasted mallow to Lenny and she gingerly removed it from the stick.She couldnt help but smile at his proud grin.Luke leaned against her as she stuck the gooey treat in her mouth.He rested his chin on her shoulder, looking directly at her face.Is it good?He asked, eyebrows going up.Lenny laughed out loud at his behavior and playfully shoved him off of her.Luke chuckled, that low, hearty chuckle that sent shivers through her.She knew she was blushing but was hoping that the glow from the fire was covering it up.Luke casually let his arm drape across her back and she instinctively leaned closer to him.After a few moments Lenny rested her head on his shoulder.They sat in silence, staring into the fire.Luke pressed his cheek against the top of her head and let out a contented sigh.Lenny knew what it meant because she was feeling the same way.It was like finally coming home.No one bothered them.They left them in their own little world.Lenny had started to pick up on the collective thought of the group that she needed to stop resisting Lukes attempts at reconciliation.She had feared they would hate him, nearly the opposite had occurred.It seemed Lenny was the only one who was still unsure.No, that wasnt it.Its not that she was unsure, it was that she was the only one who hadnt gotten caught up in the romanticized scenario that had been playing out for all of them to see.She was the only one who could see the truth.And the truth was that Lukes life came with certaincomplications.If she went back with him, it might be great for a while.But eventually, they wouldnt be able to see each other every day.And Lenny didnt know if that would count as being on a break for Luke again.Would he seek solace with someone else?Or maybe hed get tired of her all together and trade her in for someone far prettier and moreexperienced.She swallowed at that last thought.She didnt really have much to offer.Lenny sighed and Luke glanced down at her face, lit by the roaring fire.He was beyond happy to be this near to her again but he was still intimidated by her presence.She was strong and brave and tender.Her eyes missed nothing, her heart felt everything.She was completely different than any woman hed ever met.She spoke her mind but with kindness.Shed risk everything to protect those she loved.She was always trying to do the right thing, not just what felt good in the moment.Luke had no idea how he had ever gotten her to look at him in the first place.She could honestly have her pick of anyone out there.But Luke knew he was the only one who was willing to fight this hard to keep her.After a long while, the fire started to burn down and the other riders started to go to bed.Lenny knew they should probably turn in as well but she didnt want to move.If they got up and went to their separate cabins then she would have to face reality again.And she still hadnt made any definite decisions.Its getting late.Luke murmured against her hair.Mmhm.Lenny confirmed, still not moving away.Cmon, Luke stood up, pulling Lenny with him.Ill walk you to your cabin.His fingers found and intertwined into hers and they slowly walked across the snow packed ground.The light inside was on which meant that Shelby Lynn was in there and awake.Lenny slowed as they got closer to the door.Not wanting the peaceful moment to end.Luke stopped walking and turned to face her, pulling her into his strong embrace.He hugged her tight against him and she wished there was more time.How about if you meet me for breakfast tomorrow?Luke asked.Lenny nodded, swallowing away the emotion that came out of nowhere.Why was it so hard to say goodnight?She would be seeing him again in the morning.Because every goodnight is closer to goodbye.Again.Luke leaned down and kissed her cheek softly.His lips were warm on her cold skin and Lenny felt a tingle run through her.She gave him a shy, sad smile before going inside.Shelby Lynn was propped up on one elbow when Lenny came through the door.She watched quietly as Lenny changed and crawled up the ladder into the top bunk.Are you gonna take him back?Shelby asked as Lenny reached for the string to turn the light off.Lenny paused at the question.She wasnt sure how to answer.Was Luke really hers to take back?Why do you ask?Lenny asked instead, pulling the switch and enclosing the room in darkness.Because we all think you should.Lenny smiled in the dark room.All of you think that, huh?Well, its just been the most exciting thing thats happened all week.We obviously talked about it.Shelby adjusted her covers making the wooden structure rock slightly.Its not a reality show, S. L.  Lenny pointed out.The audience doesnt get a vote.I know.Shelby was quiet for a few minutes and then she sleepily sighed, You guys are so great together.Lenny pursed her lips up at the ceiling.The cabin grew quiet, Lenny heard Shelbys breathing even out and knew she had fallen asleep.Lenny wasnt so lucky.She lay awake for a long while after that, trying to figure out why Shelbys logic seemed so sound.The next day brought more adventure and even more confusing thoughts for Lenny.The group stayed together again and took some turns.Travis and Trucker started a slight competition with a small jump and pretty soon everyone was being a little more risky with their lines.Luke was his amazing, charming, smooth self.Lenny loved how he fit in perfectly with her group of friends but that didnt mean what she knew he was hoping it would mean.She still couldnt shake the thoughts from the night before.He was a rock star.He would always be a rock star.And it would take a special kind of woman to be able to deal with all the things that came along with that.Lenny wasn't sure if she would ever fit into that category.Luke was having a blast.Snowboarding was his new favorite thing.Lennys friends were awesome and being around Lenny was...intoxicating, as usual.She was unbelievable on the snow.Everything she did seemed effortless.She had raced Serge to the bottom of a very steep mountain, tying Lukes stomach in knots.But he couldnt help but let his heart swell with pride at her confidence and talent.When the others started doing some risky flips and rotations, she blew them all away.They had gotten heated and Lenny had removed her coat and flannel.She was wearing her black snow pants and a form fitting black tank with the entire back made out of lace.Luke assumed that every guy was checking her out but there was nothing he could do about it.She was captivating.Her perfect body twisted and soared in the air, her blonde hair glowing like a halo in the bright sunlight.She had no idea how beautiful she was.When they got ready to head back to base, Lenny put her coat back on and Luke knew he heard some sad groans from the guys around them.She didnt even notice.Of course she didnt.She wasnt one of those girls.She had no clue that very often she was the most gorgeous woman in the room.Luke had a devilish thought then.If Lenny knew how hot she was, with her confidence, the world would be doomed.He chuckled at himself as he followed her into the helicopter.She gave him a frown that was more of a question and he just shook his head.Everyone gravitated to the Lodge for the evenings activities.Luke sat up at the bar and watched Lenny try to teach Shelby Lynn how to play pool.It was comical and sweet at the same time.Lenny was good, like everything else in her life, but Shelby Lynn was very uncoordinated.She kept getting frustrated and would want to give up but Lennys patient words would bring her back to try again.Shane took a seat next to Luke and nodded at the bartender for a beer.When he got it and took a sip, he chuckled at Luke.Youre so obvious.Shane laughed again and Luke smirked, knowing hed been caught watching Lenny.I cant help it.Luke replied honestly.Lenny looked up and caught his stare.He didnt even try to hide it, instead he winked at her.He thought he saw her blush slightly before shaking her head and going back to Shelby Lynn.Have you guys talked anymore?Shane asked curiously.Luke sighed heavily.No, not really.He frowned slightly.Shes being pretty stubborn.Yeah, that sounds like Lenny.Shane smiled around the lip of his glass.Luke scanned the room, trying to come up with some kind of profound plan.He had thought that just spending time in Lennys world would prove that their relationship could work.But he was starting to get the feeling there was more to her rigidness than that.She wasnt being completely forthright with him and he needed to get her to open up to him.Once and for all.Thats when Luke spotted the unused dance floor tucked back in a corner.It was just beyond the jukebox.The lights around it werent on so thats why he didnt see it.It wasnt in complete darkness but it would provide a nice little private space for them to talk without her feeling completely trapped.All he had to do was convince her to dance with him.Luke grinned at Shane, I have an idea.He hopped off his stool and made his way to the jukebox.He glanced over the song lists and starting pumping quarters in the machine.He thought hed need about six songs for a decent conversation.He chose all slow, cheesy ballads, knowing shed at least find humor in it if nothing else.As Neil Diamonds husky voice started to sing Hello Again, Luke approached Lenny from behind.He saw Shelby Lynns eyes get wide but Lenny didnt turn around.Luke smiled and gently clasped her wrist, slowly twisting her to face him.She was curious and her eyes sparkled.Luke didnt say anything as he gently tugged her towards the dance floor.He put his hands on her waist and she automatically rested her hands on his shoulders.She looked uncomfortable and Luke noticed right away that she was not a very good dancer at all.He kept the pace slow and she focused on the center of his chest, concentrating on the movements of her feet.I think we should talk, Luke began in a hushed voice.He saw Lenny swallow and she subtly nodded.I want you, Luke said plainly.Lennys eyes flashed up to his and her face flushed with his choice of words.He chuckled as he realized how that sounded.I mean, I want you with me.His face growing more serious.I want you back in my life.Another verse went by as he waited for her response.When she spoke, her words came out stiffly, like it was hard for her to say them.Luke She began slowly, Youre a rock starand with that comes certaincomplications.Luke frowned down at her face but he didnt interrupt.I don't know how I can beokay, knowing that the moment were not together for a few days, youll have women standing in line to fill that void for you.Its not like that.Luke protested.I made a really bad choice   Luke, we had only been apart for a little while and you Lenny swallowed again.You   I know.Luke began to plead.I really screwed up, but it won't ever happen again.Lenny's eyebrows pushed together with confusion.But, Luke, when you love someone, it doesnt matter if youre on a break.That person should still be the only one  Lukes heart froze in his chest as he realized what she was telling him.He couldnt undo what he had done.She was right.He had been in love with her and had allowed himself to look intoother options.If she had been out kissing other guys he would have felt completely betrayed.He had never put himself in her position.The idea of Lenny with someone elsekissing him, holding himloving him.His pulse began to quicken with the rising panic of losing Lenny forever.Its hard tostart over.Her words were tiny slices in his heart, stripping away the hope he had left.I cant forget   I know, you cant forget.But maybe you could forgive.Lukes grip around her tightened, like he was afraid she would walk away from him any minute.Im so madly in love with you I cant think straight.Youre all I want.I can give up the band, the music, Boston.All of it.Anything.Just not you.Lukes words were pouring out, he couldnt stop them if he wanted to.I know I messed up.I hate what I did.I never wanted to hurt you.Ever.I should have fought for you from the beginning.I shouldve never let you walk awayI need you in my life.Youre Lukes voice cracked.youre my best friend, Lenny.Try to think about the future, Luke.Lennys voice sounded small, even to her but she needed to get it out.What happens when were separated?When Im competing, maybe, and youre around the world?And you get lonely?Youre the sexy lead singer of a major band, in case youve forgottenyou wouldnt be lonely for longand I dont think, no, I know I cant compete with that.Im just Lenny searched for the right explanation.a regular person.Her eyes settled on his chin as she said the words.You are not a regular person.Luke's firm voice brought her eyes back up to his.His jaw clenched in seriousness.You are a hell of a woman.His eyes shone with emotion.Youre it.He brought one hand up to rest on her cheek.There is no competition.You have my heart.Lenny had no words left.She couldnt deny that her heart still ached to be near Luke.That the only time shed felt any kind of peace in the past couple of weeks was when he had shown up in Valdez.She couldnt refute that even the simple act of him holding her in his arms on the deserted dance floor made her whole body tremble with excitement.I have never known anyone like you, Lenny.You are brave and strong and beautiful.You make me think I can be a better person.More importantly, you make me want to be a better person.He took a careful breath.I know we dont have it all figured out.I know Im probably gonna screw up a few more times and make you mad at me.But I also know that youre the one I want to be with to figure these things out.I dont want to do this life without you, my best friend.I'm crazy in love with you.Luke pulled her closer, holding her tight.He touched his forehead to hers so he could look her directly in the eye.Please, Lenny.Please, Luke whispered, his deep voice raspy.Forgive meI should have told you every day that I loved you.Youre the most amazing womanIyoureeverything to meyou deserve better than me but, dammit!Im not gonna ever stop trying to show you how incredible you are and how incredible we are when we're together.In that moment Lenny knew her heart had been misleading her the whole time.She had been so afraid of following it blindly that she had made all of her decisions based on fear.And they had been the wrong ones.Luke in her life was the only thing that made sense.She closed her eyes, and licked her lips slowly.Okay.She whispered.Before she could open her eyes to see his reaction his lips crashed into hers.His hands pressed into her back drawing her body flush against his.She tangled her fingers in his hair and pulled his head in, deepening their kiss.Her body reacted forcefully, feeling like it would never be close enough to him.Lenny surrendered her heart fully to him.No more second guessing or hesitation in her thoughts.This was it.No matter what happened in the future, she knew that Lukes arms would forever be her home.She could never go back to a life without them.The room broke out into applause and Lenny disrupted her kiss with Luke, laughing.She had forgotten that they were surrounded by a bunch of people.Luke still didnt seem to notice or maybe he just didnt care.He continued kissing her face and neck.He finally stepped back and addressed the onlookers.Thank you, thank you.Luke bowed and Lenny shook her head at him, a smile still on her lips.Always the entertainer.He grabbed her hand and kissed it affectionately and tugged her in the direction of the bar.You finally get all that figured out?Shane asked with a grin.Not all of it Lenny looked over at Luke who was beaming at her and he slipped an arm around her waist, pulling her to his side.But the rest is just details.She finished with a content smile.Good.Shane handed them each a beer and then toasted them.Lenny wasnt sure what was going to happen next but as she looked up at Luke and he pulled her tighter against him, she knewthey would get through it together.Luke couldn't believe the peace that had descended over him.He looked down at Lenny's laughing face and he knew...everything was going to okay now.He wasn't going to screw this up again.She caught him looking at her and her face took on a puzzled expression.What?He nuzzled her neck.Staying away from her was going to be even more difficult now.Why me, Luke?He pulled away, unable to hide the shock on his face.Why you?Are you serious?Lenny smiled shyly and bit her bottom lip.Yeah, why me?Because youre smart and funny and a good kisser.He grinned when she smiled.Because, you make me feel like Im worth a damn.Because when the rest of the world doesnt make sense, you do.Because when were together, were unstoppable.He rested his forehead against hers and looked her in the eyes.Because youre my very best friend in the whole world and Im never gonna let you go.Epilogue    Sweetness      All Im saying is, I think four weeks is more than enough time for a Honeymoon.Sway was bitching again.Harrison rolled his eyes and continued to pretend he was readingWhat magazine is this again?We have to be in L. A.  in two weeks and we dont have anything good to work with yet and hes unreachable.He put his fingers in the air to symbolize the air quotes while making a snotty expression.Dude, shut up, Mike looked at Sway with his eyebrows raised.Blake and I have written some kick ass stuff so stop insulting us.He got up from the couch and moved to the fridge.Besides, Luke gave us everything he had before he left.Sway made a disgruntled noise in the back of his throat and flopped himself into a chair, looking dejected.Let the man enjoy his honeymoon, for Petes sake.Mike said from Blakes kitchen.He pulled out some leftover pizza still in the box from the fridge, opened the lid and gave it a cautious smell.Nope, no should eat that, theyll die.He left it on the counter.Is Sway still bitching?Blake asked as he reentered the room.He picked up a slice of the cold pizza off the counter and took a bite.Mike eyed him warily but didnt say anything.We should be able to call him.Sway grumbled.No man.Mike frowned severely at him.Let him enjoy his wife.What could possibly be so important that they needed to disappear for a whole month?Sway asked like he had a point.Mike stared at him incredulous.Are you really that thick?He asked honestly.Sway frowned back, looking like a belligerent teenager.Theyre probably having sex!Harrison finally snapped.So, Ive had lots of sex.Sway almost grinned at his own words.Yeah, well, theyre not you.Harrison tossed the magazine aside and looked at Sway seriously.Luke and Lenny waited to get married.And Lenny was a virgin.Harrison felt his face heating up.I really cant believe I have to explain this to you.Sway stared at him for a few minutes as he processed his words.Suddenly the proper synapses in Sways brain fired and understanding dawned on him.His eyes grew wide.Ooohhh.He drew out the word making Blake chuckle and Mike and Harrison roll their eyes.Youre such a dumbass.Blake laughed again.Harrison ran both hands through his thick, dark hair and addressed Mike.You suppose theyll get their own bus?I hope so.Mike sniffed, I really dont want to share a bus with newlyweds.He picked up the phone to dial for fresh pizza.Where do you think theyll live?Harrison asked Blake.Blake chewed thoughtfully and swallowed before answering.I dont know.Luke is technically still homeless.Yeah, he ruined all my towels.Sway spoke up.Maybe hell move to Wyoming.Blake pointed out.Yeah, maybe.Harrison grew quiet.He was really happy for his friends but he also hated change.Do you think they might get a place here?He asked hopefully.Maybe.Blake nodded and started on another piece of cold pizza.I bet Lenny is gonna be super hot when they get back.Sway said with a wistful expression.Shell be all tan from spending a month in Hawaii.He made a clicking noise with his tongue.No.Blake corrected him, shaking his head.You cant check Lenny out anymore.Why not?Sway was getting overly frustrated.Cuz theyre married now.That would be like checking out your sister.Blake answered matter of fact.Sway sighed heavily as he thought that one through.Fine.He slumped his shoulders in resignation.What happened with that girl you were seeing?Mike asked now that he was off the phone.Sway was always a little tamer and easier to get along with when he was in a relationship.His attitude indicated he was single again.Eh, she left me for a stunt man.Sway mumbled.Really?Im sorry man.Mike meant that, he didnt like to see his friends get hurt.Its all right.Apparently he can set himself on fire.Sway tried to lighten his expression.How can I really compete with that?Mike still found it amazing that Sway had been in a monogamous relationship for more than a month.It really showed growth.Of course, they were all growing, werent they?Luke getting married was just the first big step.It would only snowball from here.As he looked around Blakes loft at his closest friends, he felt a peaceful energy deep inside.He, for one, was looking forward to what the future would bring.It was time to see what they were capable of in real life.
