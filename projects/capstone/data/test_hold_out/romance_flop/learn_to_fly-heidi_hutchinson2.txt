Lenny huffed under her breath and then shook off her bad mood.We still gonna make good time with all the extra stops?Carl pursed his lips, Yeah, for the most part.He grimaced as he thought about the time being wasted on friggin' bathroom breaks.That's the last time Sway buys tacos out of some guy's trunk.Lenny tried to hide her smirk behind her cup but Carl caught it anyway.I know, you think it's funny.It is funny!Lenny grinned at him.And it's really not Sway's fault.I mean, that Hibachi looked clean to me.Carl rolled his eyes.Well then, no more Mexican food on the road.We can't keep stopping every time he's gotta take a dump.Gross, Carl, Lenny pretended to look disgusted.He's just following the rules.She raised her eyebrows at him and he said the rule out loud with her:  No number two on the bus.That should've been the name of the tour.Carl muttered under his breath.Lenny chuckled at his orneriness.Hey, day off tomorrow, whats the plan?Carl considered before replying, I was thinking about giving you the day off, too.He raised an eyebrow and gave her a knowing look.You mean, tell everyone I have the day off and then sneak around to see if they try to get into any trouble?Lenny translated for him.Yeah, pretty much.Carl nodded.Sounds like a good idea.I think the guys are getting sick of me playing Mother Hen.It might be better for me to lay low for a day.Theyre not sick of you, they love you.Everyone does.Carl told her seriously.Lenny avoided his stern look and gave him her now famous half smirk, did her trademark move of slamming her coffee and got ready to get back to work.Carl knew it was her exit strategy for when things started to get too personal for her.She was really good at protecting herself, but he was getting to know her despite it.She didn't really allow compliments for herself.She'd get a flicker in her eye and immediately end the conversation.Just like now.Time to get back to work, Boss Man.She strode to the end bus to start her rounds, her golden hair reflecting the rising sun and bouncing the color off the shiny chrome.Carl took another sip of his coffee as he watched her depart.Damn, but that girl knew how to find good coffee.Hey!Carl called after her, Blue Bus today!She waved her hand at him over her shoulder in acknowledgment.Lenny knocked on the Red Buss door and waited for a few seconds before boarding the bus.She liked to give a small warning before entering because a couple of days ago she discovered how much Sway liked to walk around in the nude.Growing up with three brothers it wasn't anything shocking for Lenny.But Sway had actually been kind of embarrassed.Which had been pretty adorable.The guys were sitting in the main living space with guitars and papers spread all around them.They looked up in unison as Lenny entered the room.How you feeling, Sway?Lenny asked the bassist.He rubbed his belly and made a sad face, Now that I've shit out half my intestines I feel a little better.Nice.Lenny shook her head.Well, Carl says no more Mexican food on the road.Agreed, Blake and Harrison replied as one.You ready to hit the road?She asked as she inspected their refrigerator and bathroom supplies.Who are you riding with today?Blake asked curiously.Blue Bus today.Hopefully it'll be less stinky.She teased, waving her hand in front of her face.Sway looked apologetic and Lenny grinned at him.Don't feel bad, we've all been there.Hey, whats the plan for the day off tomorrow?Harrison seemed hesitant to ask.His large brown eyes looking anywhere but directly at Lenny.Um, lets see, Lenny said, pretending to think about it.A whole day off in Virginia BeachI think I might actually go to the beach.She laughed at their silent faces.What?Carl said I could have the day off, too.Cool.We were just talking abouthow you needed a day off.Harrison quickly covered as Blake gave him a stern look.Sure ya were.Lenny smirked, I know, Ive been in your hair a lot.You need a break, I get it.She smiled at their protesting faces but didn't leave room for discussion.Its cool, I totally understand.Ill see you later, she waved as she left the bus.Lennys next stop was the Blue Bus with Mike and Luke.It was her favorite stop of the day, thats why she usually saved it for last.And today was even better because she would be getting to stay.Lenny tried to stifle the spark of excitement that was bouncing around in her belly.She knocked and paused.She hadn't had any indecent accidents on this bus like the other one but she decided that she really couldn't be too careful.Besides, Luke Casey naked was not an image she really needed to have in her head forever.Unfortunately.That would make working for him that much harder.Making her way into the living space she could see Mike sleeping on the sofa, looked like hed been there all night.Empty water bottles and candy wrappers littered the floor.Automatically, she started to pick up the garbage and throw it away.Luke came out of the bathroom, having just showered, with a towel slung low on his hips.Why is Mike sleeping on the couch?You guys have a fight?She quipped, refusing to look up, knowing she wouldnt be able to keep herself from staring at Lukes perfectly sculpted chest and abs.Freaking Adonis.Luke retreated to the back room to put clothes on.When he reemerged he was wearing faded jeans and a black t shirt, his hair still wet and messy from the shower.He had started to grow some scruff on his face a few days ago and hadnt shaved it.But it looked good on him.Made him look older.He stepped towards Lenny and took the now full trash bag from her hands to tie it closed.He was watching a movie last night and decided to sleep out here, he explained in a hushed voice.He was standing close to Lenny so that she could hear him and she could smell the fresh shampoo from his shower and his minty breath.Suddenly, she was very aware of her coffee breath and took a step back.She smiled casually, ignoring the flush she felt creeping up her neck, and opened the refrigerator to give it a quick scan.What movie was it?She asked, surprised at the steadiness of her voice despite the pounding of her pulse.The intensity with which her body consistently responded to Luke's presence was alarming, to say the least.Rear Window with Jimmy Stewart.His voice was close again, just over her shoulder, and she swallowed hard before turning around.His crystal blue eyes scanned her face slowly.He had successfully backed her into the corner of the kitchenette.She licked her bottom lip nervously and saw his gaze drop to her mouth and stay there.I love that movie, too.Lenny reached for the trash bag, grazing his hand with her own as she slipped it from Lukes grasp.He inhaled sharply and she stepped around him, quickly backing towards the door.Ill make sure you guys get a refill of water before we take off.She paused, trying to get her heart rate under control, I'm riding on this bus today so...I'll be right back.Luke took a step toward her, What are you going to do tomorrow?Maybe go to the beach with Tanya and the other merch girls, she lied, looking away from his penetrating gaze.That sounds like fun Luke acted like there was more he wanted to say but couldn't think of it.Yeahso Ill be right back.She repeated, but this time she turned around, finally breaking the tension between them and walked down the steps.Mike watched their interaction through slits in his eyes and held back the deep chuckle that wanted to escape.That sounds like fun, Mike mocked softly from the couch.Luke turned to him, clearly surprised that he was awake.Youre an ass, he muttered to his friend on his way to the back of the bus.Mike let the chuckle out now; he enjoyed giving his best friend a hard time.Luke didn't really have crushes, so there was so much more material to be worked.Luke had never had a hard time getting women.He'd usually just give them a lip curl and a wink and they were suddenly topless.To Mike, it was very interesting to see Luke struggle so much with basic conversation around a girl.Maybe you can help put lotion on her back, he continued to tease.Luke huffed and closed the door to the back lounge, leaving Mike on the couch laughing.What's in the notebook?Mike asked with curiosity, nodding towards Lenny.She looked up and Mike thought he detected a bit of panic on her face, but she quickly smoothed it out.Just my journal, sort of, she muttered, closing it and tucking it back into her bag.You don't have to put it away, I was just wondering, Mike reassured.I was finished anyway, Lenny's dark blue eyes connected briefly with his and he gave her a small smile.You writing the next Great American Novel?He kept it light, still trying to get a good bead on her.Hardly.She tucked a stay hair that had come out of her braid behind her ear.She stood up and stretched her arms over her head.These long hours on the bus sure do get my muscles all bunched up.Yeah, you seem like you're pretty active.The drive must about make you crazy.Mike gauged her reaction to a personal assumption about herself.If it bothered her, she didn't show it.Getting to know the 'real' Lenny was Mike's new hobby.She was an expert at deflection and ambiguity.It didn't upset Mike or bring him any cause for worry.To him, it was a new way to pass the time on the long drives.It's not so bad.Lenny answered with a sigh.Besides, it's not every day I get the opportunity to travel with one of the world's greatest bands.And there it was, deflecting his personal inquiry into a compliment about the band.It was her MO.If a question required a personal answer, she would stroke the ego of the inquisitor.It was like a weird game of chess, with words and presumptions being the moving pieces.Mike loved it.Carl said you go running during sound check everyday, Luke joined them from the back lounge.He'd been noticeably absent, Mike thought.Usually wherever Lenny was, Luke was hanging around nearby.But he'd kept his distance most of the day, which Mike didn't understand.He clearly liked the girl.Yeah, it's a habit I picked up a few years ago.Lenny averted her eyes and sat back down.I usually run in the mornings when we park.You should join me sometime.Luke's lead singer confidence was back to oozy goodness.Lenny's eyes flashed to Luke's for a second and Mike was certain she almost blushed.These two were so attracted to one another, and continued to fail at pretending as if they weren't, that it was almost comical to witness.Unless you think you wouldn't be able to keep up.Luke playfully provoked when Lenny didn't answer right away.That's the least of my worries.Lenny gave him a sideways smile.I like to run alone, helps me think.I promise not to talk, Luke pressed, You won't even notice I'm there.Mike was beginning to wonder if they noticed he was even there.If Mike's attempts at divulging Lenny's carefully concealed inner self was like chess, then whatever it was that Lenny and Luke did was like fencing.Fluid.Graceful.Advance.Passata soto.Then why do you want me there?Do you need a bodyguard?Lenny's tone turned playful.Opposition Parry.Luke guffawed, Maybe.Sometimes I get scared.He winked at Mike.There could be bears out there.Forward Recovery.Oh yeah, Mike verified, Luke picks up wild animals like nobody's business.He wasn't sure if he was helping or even what he was helping with; Luke still hadn't made any declarations to him about his intentions with Lenny.Lenny let out a small laugh and she pulled her legs up under herself in the chair, slipping off her shoes.I guess it wouldn't hurt.She gave Luke a serious scowl.But I run with a purpose, it's not a fashion show for me.I plan on looking ugly and unkempt.Good, better to scare away the bears.Flick.Lenny wasn't sure when she had drifted off.She remembered talking with Mike and Luke about the new song they had been trying out the past couple of shows.Then they had lunch.Sandwiches.Mike decided to get Lenny involved in his favorite soap opera.He had waved her over to the couch so she could have a better view of the show and she settled in between the two men.The next thing she knew, she was laying in the middle of a field under a perfect bluebird sky.She hadn't seen a sky this crystal clear in so long.The wildflowers surrounding her smelled clean and masculine.Masculine?Wait a minute, that's not right.But it felt sooo right.Lenny rolled onto her side and inhaled deeply.Mmmmm, you smell like snowflakes.She heard thunder in the distance, a storm must be coming.She felt the ground rumble beneath her and her eyes flew open when she realized it wasn't thunder but a very deep, hearty chuckle.A man's chuckle.Lenny sat up so quickly her vision darkened.She tried to focus on something, anything.Mike was gone.The TV was playing but on mute and the cabin was the golden colors of early evening.Whoa, calm down, Len.Luke's voice was gentle as he placed his warm hand on the center of her back to steady her.His blonde, messy hair swung across his forehead, covering his eyes.I'm sorry, I didn't know I fell asleep.Lenny's neck was heating up and she used one hand to wipe the side of her face.It was as bad as she feared.Drool.It's fine, you were obviously tired.You work your freaking ass off; I think you've earned yourself a nap.Luke's fingers had started to make small circles on her back, soothing her.They worked their way up to her braid and tugged on the elastic, pulling it free.I didn't mean to...um...drool.Lenny was humiliated.She moved to try to stand up but Luke put his other hand on her knee, stopping her.The warmth from his touch seemed to melt her to the seat.Really, Lenny, he said sincerely, making sure to have eye contact, You didn't do anything wrong.You need to learn to take a break sometime.His fingers were still working into her hair and untangling the tight twists of her braid.Lenny gave him a tight smile, wishing she could believe what he was saying.But what if Carl had walked in at that moment?How could she explain why her head had been in the lap of a rock star?She'd have been fired for sure.No, she would have to be more careful.And she really needed to stop whatever black magic Luke was doing to her hair.Besides, who doesn't like being told they smell like snowflakes?Luke was trying not to smile but he was failing.Lenny's eyes widened as she realized she had said that out loud!How else could she embarrass herself today?I was dreaming, Lenny muttered, coolly moving Luke's hand off her knee and tensing to stand up again.Luke's hand in her hair held her still.Give me minute, his deep voice commanded.His fingers found the knot in her muscles at the back of her neck and started a gentle, but firm, massage.Lenny let out a small sigh as he worked the tension free.Dreaming about me or snowflakes?Luke whispered low in her ear, causing goosebumps to raise on Lenny's arms.Neither, Lenny muttered and she finally broke out of his spell and got up and crossed to the other side of the cabin, settling back in her chair.Can I have my hair tie back?She asked, holding out her hand and disliking the breathless way her words had come out.Luke's face was unreadable as he watched her.No, he finally said, I've noticed you've been getting headaches and I'm worried that braid is adding undo pressure.Lenny sat back at his statement.It made sense.Her headaches usually blossomed right at the base of her skull where the top of her braid began.But she had no idea that he had been noticing those things about her.Her goal had been to be as invisible and as unassuming as possible.The last thing she wanted was attention.And since I can't get you to take any regular kind of break, the least I can do is require you to let your hair down, he grinned at her, so to speak.Luke's smile caused warmth to fill her appendages and she bit the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling back.Besides, you wear that damn thing every day; it's time for a change.He wrapped the hair tie around his wrist and gave her a serious look.And anytime you need me to work on the tension you have building in your neck, you let me know.He arched an eyebrow flirtatiously.Sure thing, boss.Lenny replied, seeing the slight tick in Luke's jaw when she said the word 'boss. 'He didn't like being reminded that they had a working relationship but one of them had to right the rocking ship.He was getting too familiar and she had to keep him at a safer distance.Lenny flipped her head over and shook out her hair, pulling the strands through her fingers and releasing any tangles.She couldn't deny that it felt good to have it free.Every follicle was rejoicing in triumph.Silly follicles.When she righted herself, she saw Luke staring at her with hazy eyes.She knew what that look meant, she'd seen it before, on other men looking at other women.She didn't understand why Luke was directing that kind of a look at her.She knew she wasn't ugly but she wasn't anything beyond...ordinary.She chose to ignore it and pulled out her cellphone to check for any messages.A couple texts from Harrison in regards to Blake eating the last of his Crunch Berries, a dirty joke from Sway and an ETA from Carl.We should be in Virginia Beach soon.Lenny informed Luke, hoping the subject change would snap him back to reality.You really going to the beach tomorrow?Luke asked, shifting into a casual slouch on the sofa.The setting sun cast shadows in the cabin and darkened his face so she couldn't read his expression.Yep, Lenny lied.She hated that she had to lie.You could come fishing with me and Mike, he offered slowly.Lenny cleared her throat.Honestly?She would much rather go fishing with Luke and Mike then have to play party to Carl's paranoia.But that wasn't an option.No, I think I better work on my tan.I've just never seen you really talk to the merch girls; I didn't know you guys hung out.Luke suspected something.Probably not the truth, but he definitely thought she was up to something else.Lenny could feel him studying her and her pulse quickened.Just say what you want to say, Luke, Lenny replied in a low voice, Ask me the question that's really on your mind.This was a dangerous game, even for Lenny.If Luke guessed outright what she was doing...she would admit it.And Carl would flip shit.The cabin was quiet save for the hum of the wheels on the road.Lenny thought about turning on the overhead light so she could read Luke's face.Are you seeing someone on the road crew?His voice was dark and rough, as if the question was painful to ask.Lenny felt a small smile play on her lips.No,  she let let out a relieved sigh.Nope, I'm as single as they come.She connected his suspicions and had to admit that it did indeed look like she was sneaking off to meet a secret lover.She almost laughed at the idea but Luke turned on the lights in the cabin and the serious look on his face sobered her instantly.He returned to his seat but continued to study her.She met his gaze without flinching.Are you seeing Carl?He asked, his mouth flat.Lenny's eyes widened and her eyebrows raised at Luke.Seriously?He didn't respond, watching her with that penetrating stare of his.As if he could extract the truth from her by willing it from the depth of her soul.No, Lenny shook her head, incredulous, I am not seeing Carl.That would be...She couldn't think of the correct word to finish with.Absurd, creepy, wrong, insane, all came to mind.That would be what?Luke demanded an end to her sentence.Weird.Lenny finally vocalized.And very, very wrong.She lifted her hair off of her now hot neck and pulled it over one shoulder.Why would you even think that?You seem really comfortable with him, Luke stated plainly.Apparently Carl wasn't the only one Lenny was comfortable around.She still couldn't wrap her head around the fact that she had been asleep in Luke's lap.Her, the girl who can't sleep.Drooling in Luke Casey's lap.It was ludicrous.I guess he reminds me of my brother, Scott.Lenny said slowly.The tense lines around Luke's mouth seemed to relax and the playfulness came back into his voice.Then what's the real reason you won't come fishing tomorrow?Oh, boy.Lenny was about to spill.She swallowed hard, lying to Luke left a bad taste in her mouth.I can't tell you, she finally mustered out.She wanted to smack her forehead with her palm.Why was she so weak when it came to him?The silence that followed was oppressive and Lenny thought she was actually going to choke.And then Luke let her off the hook.I can accept that, he dipped his head in truce.You don't have to tell me everything, Lenny...just don't lie to me.Can I ask you a question?Lenny took advantage of the familiarity that seemed to erupt between them without her permission.It may have been her imagination, or possibly her ego, but she had the distinct impression that Luke was more open with her than he realized.Always.He answered without pause and she felt a tiny shiver race down her spine.What changed in between this tour and the last one?She licked her bottom lip and tried to clarify quickly, I mean, I know that Mike was in rehab but it seems like this is really important to you.To all of you, she looked at him with soft eyes, But especially you.Luke let out a careful breath, That obvious, huh?He chuckled nervously and rubbed his hand down the side of his face.Lenny was a little fearful she'd asked too personal of a question.But she couldn't stop herself this time.She wanted to know.Her need to know more about Luke was sometimes overpowering, like now.It overshadowed her sensible reasoning to keep a safe distance.She wanted to see past the image that was projected to the public and know who he was at his core.Why did he give her want to make exceptions to all the rules that she believed would keep her safe from defeat?Was it the way his mouth curved up slightly on one side, how his voice deepened when he talked about his friends, the way he seemed to have one more thing to say but never said it?All of the above.It's hard to explain.His eyebrows raised slightly and he focused on the center of the floor.My parents died in a car accident when I was in fourth grade and my great aunt took me in.I met Mike in sixth grade and we were pretty much inseparable after that.My aunt died a week after I turned eighteen, leaving me a ton of money and no relatives.His eyes returned to hers and she saw something deeper, more vivid, than Luke had ever revealed.The band became my family.I'd do anything for them.But we got too big too fast and none of us were super responsible about what to do with that kind of popularity.I was drinking, his eyes widened and he looked into his lap, a lot.I didn't pay attention to what was happening to us.The night we almost lost Mike, I realized how much I needed him.They're my family, maybe not by blood, but that doesn't really matter.They're my brothers.You love them.Lenny said it as a definitive statement, squeezed from her by the emotion she heard in his voice as he relayed his simple story.Yes, he nodded.More than anything.He looked into her face and she couldn't help but see the burden he carried for his loved ones.The inner conviction and loyalty that drove him.The music is more than a hobby or something we happen to be good at.It's who we are.It's or heart breath, our creed, our passion.His blue eyes blazed around the edges.That's why this tour is so important to me.Because they're important to me.Lenny's heart pounded at his words.His intensity, his truth...it was exquisite.She didn't get a chance to respond because Mike rejoined them at that moment.He staggered from the back of the bus, his messy brown hair even more mussed.He rubbed his sleepy eyes and looked back and forth between Luke and Lenny.That's not where I left you.He winked at Lenny and she felt her face flush as she remembered where she had awoken only a short time ago.Mike chuckled at her discomfort and got a bottle of water out of the fridge.Hey, throw me one of those, Luke called to him and Mike tossed a bottle his direction.You joining us for movie's and popcorn tonight?Mike directed at Lenny.I, uh, Lenny stammered.She had no idea what she was going to be doing that night.She hadn't discussed it with Carl.But more than that, she was still reeling from the complex emotions that Luke had stirred in her.When we park we're going over to the Red Bus, you're coming with us.Mike held up his hand to stop her weak protest.We're the ones who asked you to come on this crazy adventure, it would rude to ditch you.Lenny sighed in mock disgust but she gave him a smile.If you say so.She locked eyes with Luke momentarily.It was enough to cause her heart to stall.He was beautiful.And not only on the outside.They arrived in Virginia Beach around eight that night, the buses parked and everyone disembarked.It had been a long two weeks.Crew and personnel scattered almost immediately.They werent staying in hotels for a lot of the tour because they were trying to cut costs.The band had to prove themselves as a big draw again.They had decided to buy their own tour buses which helped keep the crew comfortable during their crazy, sometimes back to back performances.The schedule they were on was hairy, but they were more than prepared for it.The investment of the transportation and skipping hotel accommodations for the majority of the trip, had been an easy and efficient way of getting the label's backing for such a date heavy tour.The band would all go separate ways tomorrow for the day.But for the night before, they all gathered in the Red Bus to go over music Sway was working on and watch movies.Having Lenny tag along was a natural addition to their close knit family.Mike could see her apprehension and decided to give her free rein of the remote control.He understood the complex idea of an outsider trying to fit into a dynamic that was already tight and bonded.It couldn't be easy.Lenny smiled gratefully as Sway placed the popcorn bowl in her lap.That was something concrete Mike had picked up on, Lenny liked to eat.Blake was already popping more for everyone else.Lenny started to flip through channels, pausing on ESPN sports network for a moment.She casually glanced around, not noticing Mike lounging in the back, watching though half lidded eyes.She turned her attention back to the sports update.He watched as her body noticeably shifted closer to the screen.Her eyes lit up while the channel showed images of snowboarders practicing in anticipation of the Winter X games coming up in a couple months.Mike caught Lukes eye and raised his chin in Lennys direction.Find anything good yet?Blake asked abruptly and she quickly changed the channel.Not yet.Lenny replied, scrolling through the list again.She eventually settled on an old classic movie.An American in Paris with Gene Kelly.Mike was a sucker for old movies and it distracted him from asking Lenny about the snowboarding.You don't really like this, do you?Blake made a face at Lenny.Well, it's no Brigadoon...Lenny smiled.Brigadoon!Mike heard himself shout.He knew he had just gotten more excited than his usual.Everyone turned to stare at him.You like Brigadoon too?He asked Lenny, getting up and moving onto the couch so he could be closer to her.Holy crap, yes.Lenny giggled.You've got to be kidding me!Blake grumbled.There's two of them?I always wanted to be Cyd Charisse when I grew up, Lenny confessed.Mike didn't know the last time he had been this happy.He was the only one who ever got into the old movies, especially the musicals.He saw Blake roll his eyes but ignored him.I made my mom sign me up for ballroom dancing because I wanted to be the next Gene Kelly.How did you end up becoming a drummer?She asked, her smile wide.Turns out I have a great sense of rhythm but two left feet.Mike grinned and took some of the popcorn she offered.Mike and Lenny talked through the whole movie.They raved over the actors and the characters and the plot line.They exchanged quotes from their favorite classic movies, trying to best each other in a guessing game.Mike knew they were driving the others crazy but he didn't care.His chess game with Lenny had shifted into ping pong and she was volleying with equal give and take.When did you get into the classics?Lenny asked.I'm not sure, they were always a part of my life.But I got reattached while I was in rehab.Mike stated matter of fact.He sensed the mood of the room shift.He hated that.Anytime his past drug use came up, everyone started using kid gloves.Im sorry, Lennys eyes were apologetic.Its not your fault, Mike stayed casual.I have a problem; its something I have to be able to acknowledge.Its what keeps me on track.The room was quiet, Lenny looked into her lap.Hey, dont feel bad.He said smiling at her, trying to break the tension.Im the one who screwed up.Im thankful I didnt die and Im thankful I have these idiots to help hold me accountable.He playfully shoved her shoulder.When did you get into classic movies?He turned the question on her.Lenny swallowed and tried to push past the awkwardness she clearly felt.I saw My Fair Lady when I was eight.I decided right then and there that no one would ever be as beautiful as Audrey Hepburn.The air in the bus seemed to relax a little more and Mike asked her questions about her her childhood.Now all the guys were paying close attention, this was the most Lenny had ever shared about herself.She talked about growing up in Wyoming and having three older brothers.Dang, three older brothers, that explains your competitive side.Mike acknowledged.Yeah, Lenny's face was open as she talked about her siblings.They definitely taught me a lot.I was sort of an accident.Scott, David and Nathan were all really close together.Scott was twelve when I was born.David was eleven and Nathan was ten.So you were the baby, essentially.I guess you could say that, though they would never let me feel like it.I wanted to keep up with them so bad and they were more than happy to let me tag along.I think I was afforded a lot more opportunity than others would have been in a similar situation.Lenny got a faraway look in her eyes and Mike could tell she was feeling a little home sick.Do you get to talk to them very often?Mike asked gently.Not as much as they would like, Lenny admitted.Scott calls every day but mostly to lecture me on my priorities.Do they know what youre doing now?Yeah, but they just like to worry.Lenny tried to wave it off but she obviously really missed her brothers.What about your folks?Mike wanted to find out all he could before her walls went back up.My folks are awesome, honestly.Theyre really great people.Theyre just having a hard time with me growing up.Mike noticed Lenny space off a little in their conversation but instead of drawing her back in, he changed the channel.The movie had ended a few minutes ago and he wanted to try an experiment.He turned the station back to ESPN and the sports broadcasters were still talking about the Winter X games preparation.Lenny zeroed right in on the screen.Mike kept one eye on Lenny and one on the TV.Her face was pinched and tight, like she was trying to not feel whatever it was she was feeling right now.It morphed into obvious distress as they started to show a profile of a female snowboarder, Cody Carmichael.She was talking excitedly about the upcoming games and the interviewer asked her about her Olympic gold medal from two years ago.Lenny stood abruptly, yanking the remote away from Mike and switching off the TV.Everyone looked up at her sudden movement and she stared directly into Mikes eyes.He'd gone too far.Checkmate.I have to go.She darted out of the bus.What the hell?Sway asked, confused.Mike exchanged glances with Luke who had been watching from across the room.He put down his notebook and grabbed his hoodie.Ill check on her.He waved them off and bounded out of the bus.She was lacing up her running shoes when Luke walked onto the bus.Kinda late for a run, isnt it?He asked, trying to appear casual but his concern was showing through.Nope, Lenny answered stoically.Her demeanor was drastically different than it had been most of the day.She was cold towards Luke, closed off.Luke was glad he was wearing his sweatpants and tennis shoes; he followed her out the door and matched her pace.You dont have to come, she snapped.I know, Luke answered, not even breathing hard.Lenny picked up her pace, pushing Luke to keep up.She kept increasing speed until she was at a flat out run, turning corners and crossing streets with unbelievable fluidity.They rounded a corner and came to a large city pond with a bike path that ran alongside of it.Luke matched her step for step, breath for breath.She was running on pure emotion now.As they crested a small incline she ran out of breath and collapsed flat out in the grass staring up at the star filled sky.Luke looked down at her for a beat and then he took a seat next to her.He let her rest for a few minutes before speaking.You can really run.She snickered a little and sat up, still panting.I told you that you didnt have to come, she reminded.She pushed her sweaty hair off her face and readjusted her hasty ponytail.Luke looked up into the sky and then turned his eyes on her.His kept his voice soft as he asked, What happened?He saw a thousand emotions debating across her face but she wouldn't give voice to any of them.You know, I had to chase Mike once.Luke began; he brought his knees up and rested his forearms across them.Of course, he hopped a plane and went to L. A.  You were much easier to catch.He leaned his shoulder into hers for a moment and looked into her face again.What happened, Len?Its nothing.Lenny was building those walls again and Luke could feel her shutting him out.He sighed and put his arm around her shoulders pulling her tight to his side.Trying to keep her from shutting him out completely.Okay.I wont push.At first Lenny stiffened at his sudden embrace but then relaxed and turned her face into his chest.I shouldnt have taken off.Theyre gonna want to know whats wrong with me.Lennys voice was muffled by Lukes sweatshirt.Theyll get over it.Luke rubbed her back reassuringly.Luke had never just held a woman before and he had been able to seize that opportunity twice today.It felt really good to feel her softness against his side.She smelled amazing, the heat from the run mixing with her subtle perfume.He used both arms to pull her a little closer.When she didn't resist he felt a strange satisfaction in that.Why did Mike run?Lenny asked into the silence.That's not fair.Luke tenderly corrected.I can't divulge my best friend's secrets without anything in return.Lenny's hand fisted against his sweatshirt and he pressed his lips to the top of her head.Luke?Lenny's voice came out small and slow.Yeah?How long did I sleep this afternoon?Luke thought back to this afternoon when Lenny had snuggled into his side and eventually rested her head in his lap.She had fallen asleep almost the instant he had touched her.Four hours.Luke answered honestly and he felt her tense beneath him.Why do you ask?Why didn't you wake me up?She asked, ignoring his question.Because...Luke didn't know how to answer that.Not without sounding like a psycho.Oh well....I wanted you to feel safe.He tightened his grip around her, trying to drive that point home.Lenny wrapped her arms around his middle and Luke closed his eyes in relief.They sat together quietly for a long time before Lenny stood.She had put the pieces back together of her crumbling wall and she was her regular, centered self again.Luke realized that no matter how comfortable someone may seem being alone, they all needed someone every now and again.You wanna go back?She asked.Luke nodded and they began a slow jog back to the buses.His head was spinning at having spent so much focused time with Lenny.He had a peek into her world.Even though she had shut him out again, Luke knew that he had been the one to lend her the strength to repair whatever had broken her tonight.As they rounded the corner and the buses came into view, Lenny slowed her pace to walk to cool down.Thanks for letting me hang out with you guys tonight.She said quietly into the humid night air.You can always hang with us, Len.Youre a part of us now.His sincerity made Lenny smile.He would do anything to see that smile more often.And thanks for, she gestured to the way they had come, all that.Anytime.He wanted to pull her into his arms.He didn't want the night to be over.He didn't want her to be alone anymore.He walked her to the foot of the steps of the crew bus and he had an idea.She might not go for it but then again  Hey, we have the extra space for a third person on the Blue Bus if you would like to move over there with me and Mike...permanently.Lenny raised her eyes at his suggestion, Dont you think that would be a little inappropriate?Why?Luke didnt understand.Lenny let out a small laugh, Because Im a girl and you are, well, notorious rock stars.Luke grimaced when he finally understood what she was implying.But its not like that with you; youre like a sister to us.Lenny took a deep breath, Ill ask Carl what he thinks.Luke nodded his head, Fair enough.He started to back away, Good night, Lenny.Good night, Luke.Luke turned around and scowled to himself.Youre like a sister to us?Why would I say something so stupid?He most definitely did not view her as a sister.He shook his head and climbed the stairs to the Red Bus to say good night to the fellas before turning in himself.They had questions of course, but he deflected them the best he could, protecting Lennys vulnerability.It felt good to protect her.Normal.Maybe he was too hellbent on rescuing people he cared about.Maybe it was because there was nothing he could do to save his parents and so he was trying to make up for that by rescuing everyone else, whether they wanted it or not.That was a depressing thought.Or maybe he was falling in love with her.Lennys mind refused to let her fall asleep.Again.Long after the crew had come back to the bus and had filled the bunks, she was still lying in the darkness.Waiting for exhaustion to win out over her thoughts.The lines were blurring between her job and her desire to be their friend.Especially Luke.She couldnt explain the irresistible pull she felt towards him.She got along with the other guys really well, but Lukehe was special.Every time they had eye contact it felt like she was getting electrocuted.In a good way.She sighed and rolled over to face the wall.Why did he have to be so damn perfect?Tonight he hadnt even made a move; he had simply held her, without expectations.That was new, especially considering his reputation.Then that conversation earlier that exposed so much of his complicated loveliness...and now he was asking her to move to his bus.No way would Carl be okay with that.It had to stop; she couldn't let it go any further.It was protection for him just as much as it was for her.An unexplainable tear made its way out of the corner of her eye and traveled down to the pillow.4    Creatures (For A While)      I am the king of this castle!Blake shouted from the top of the bar.He lifted his beer pitcher high in the air and the crowd cheered as he started to pour it down his throat, spilling frothy overflow onto the front of his shirt.CHUG!CHUG!CHUG!The spectators shouted at his feet, pumping their fists in the air.How the hell did this happen?!Carl snarled as he and Lenny tried to push through the mass of people to get to the inebriated guitarist.I dont know, Carl!They lied to me!Lenny yelled back angrily.The day had started very differently from where it was ending up.Lenny had told the guys she was going to the beach with some of the merch booth girls.But she didnt.Carl had wanted her to follow the guys and make sure they didnt cause trouble and negative headlines.Lenny thought he was being a touch too controlling but he was her boss, she didnt want to tell him that two weeks into her employment.Besides, she really didnt think the guys would get into any trouble.Theyd been on the road for a little while now and they had shown no interest in the former things that had tainted the atmosphere of their previous tour.Lenny had to wonder if Carl was just being overly pessimistic or if there was some truth to his anxiety.Luke and Mike went offshore fishing.Easy enough.All Carl had to do was follow them to the pier and wait in a small caf till they returned.Sway, Harrison and Blake said they were going to a local water park.Lenny suspected Carl had her follow those three because she was younger and would blend in easier with the youthful crowd.She was thankful that she could wear her bathing suit and still get a tan, adding to her alibi of going to the beach.The guys rented a private cabana but that didn't limit their social capacity.It did, however, make it easier for Lenny to track them.Sway had women all over him, constantly bringing him lemonade and reapplying sunscreen to him every ten minutes.Harrison and Blake were much more active, they enjoyed the rides and were very affable with the fans that recognized them, signing autographs and posing for photos.Lenny was impressed with their graciousness and humility.Sometime in the late afternoon, Lenny lost them.They left the water park early and Lenny got stuck in traffic.This is exactly what Carl didnt want to happen.Desperate, she called Harrison on his cell, thinking he was the most likely to tell her the truth.Hey Lenny, hows the beach?He sounded nervous, that wasn't good.We came back early, Tanya got a sunburn.That would be an easy cover, Tanya was always sunburned.Where are you guys?She tried to sound curious but not overly so.Um, were headed to a movie downtown.He didnt sound like himself and Lenny could hear Sway whispering something to him in the background.I have to go, its about to start.And he hung up.Lenny had no choice but to believe them so she pointed the rental car in that direction.But they werent downtown.They went to the far west side.To a biker bar.About the same time Lenny figured out they werent at the theater, she saw a picture sent to her on Twitter of Blake having a drinking contest with the lead guitarist from their opening act, Juniper Highlights.Cursing herself for being so nave and cursing them for lying, Lenny called Carl.They each raced to the bar to attempt to stop what they both feared.But by the time they got there, it was too late.Blake had already crawled up on top of the bar.And now he was waving his shirt over his head.Lenny got to him first and shoved other patrons out of the way.She grabbed him by his pant legs and shouted up at him, Blake!Please come down!Pretty Lenny!He smiled at her happily, Cmere, Pretty Lenny.He wriggled his hips to the beat and attempted what Lenny could only guess to be his best Coyote Ugly moves.His words were slurred and he was weaving a little on the bar.Out of the corner of her eye Lenny saw dozens of camera phones taking pictures.The place was packed.This was a nightmare.She climbed up on the bar with him much to the pleasure of the crowd.The air was now filled with cat calls and whistles.Ignoring all the requests for her to take off her own shirt, Lenny grabbed Blake tightly by the shoulders and began to help him down off the bar into Carls waiting arms.His skin had a fine sheen of sweat mixed with beer and Lenny's fingers had difficulty getting a decent grip on him.She was forced to hold him close to her to keep from dropping him.The stench turned her stomach and added to her already pissed off state.As they helped him through the crowd, he stumbled, and Lenny and Carl had to hold him up on each side.Sway and Harrison emerged from the mass of bodies and were met with angry glares from both Lenny and Carl.Can we help?Harrison asked.Pay your friends tab!Lenny bit out.She ignored Harrison's wide eyes.She felt her anger burning low in her belly and knew she was on the verge of losing her temper.Blake, oblivious to Lenny's ire, started singing along with the music and tried to dance again but fell instead.He sat down hard on the floor with his legs splayed out in front of him like a toddler.He reached his arms up towards Lenny and gave her a sloppy grin.Kiss me!He declared.Kiss me now!And then he dissolved into uncontrolled giggles.Lenny ground her teeth together, her heart beginning to hammer with barely controlled rage.She and Carl helped him back into a standing position and maneuvered him through the door and into the parking lot.Blake's arm was haphazardly pulling her hair as he tried to keep his own balance and Lenny grimaced.Waiting outside were the punkers from Juniper Highlights, doubled over in laughter.Lenny used all the self control she had left to move past them and get Blake in the van before any media showed up.But then, they started heckling.Your mama had to come get ya, huh?The tall skinny one laughed.Lenny's face was already flushed with exertion but she felt a new surge of heat bloom across her cheeks.For some reason, Blake felt it necessary to defend himself; he pushed Lenny and Carl away and held up his fists, charging towards the mockers.Ill kick your ass!He was threatening when he stumbled and fell backwards.Lenny and Carl helped him up again.The punkers were laughing even harder now.Lenny shot a death glare in their direction but kept moving.We just need to get out of here.Lenny tried to focus on the task at hand.Guess you cant hold you drink as well as you thought, huh, old man!More laughter.Lenny literally bit her tongue and tasted blood.She exchanged glances with Carl from behind Blake's shoulders and he shook his head at her.He must've been reading her mind.Theres nothing worse than a talent less, washed up rock star who doesnt know when to quit!That was the last straw.Lenny'd had a long day.She was beyond angry at this point.Of all the mistakes she had made that day, letting some dick less moron talk trash about someone she considered a friend would not be another one.HEY!Lenny whirled on them, dropping Blake into Carls arms.Blake Diedrich has more talent in one earlobe that you have in your entire piss poor excuse of a band!Then she charged.She was lunging, her vision completely red, when she felt two strong arms grab her by her waist and pull her back.She pushed the arms away, clawing to get to the punkers.She broke free and tore towards them once more.Who do you think you are?Huh?Youre no one!She screamed as she rushed them.She shoved the guy and he fell to the ground with a thud, her eyes blazed with fury as she cocked her left leg up to kick him in the chest.Suddenly Sway's arms grabbed a tight hold of her again and lifted her up and backwards, retreating to the waiting van.The frightened hecklers had fallen silent.Sway handed Lenny over to Harrison who pulled her into the van and closed the door.He got in the front passenger seat and Carl squealed the tires on the van as he whipped out of the parking lot.Lenny was in the backseat breathing hard, blood boiling.Her body trembling with the adrenaline surge.Harrison tentatively touched her arm to calm her down but she jerked away.Are you kidding me?!She yelled.What the hell?She threw her head against the back of the seat and closed her eyes, angry tears pushing out from under her eyelids.Im sorry, Lenny  Harrison began, his expression pale.Dont!She snapped, pointing her finger at him.She rubbed the wetness off her face and smelled the beer on her hands from carrying Blake.She let out another growl and wiped her hands on her jeans.Lenny, Sway leaned around the seat but Carl reached over and put his hand on his chest, signaling him to stop.No one dared to speak the rest of the trip.By the time they made it back to the buses, Blake was ready to throw up.Lenny helped him to a patch of grass a few yards away and rubbed his back as he heaved.Carl took Harrison and Sway inside the bus and proceeded to lecture them for their recklessness and irresponsibility.Lenny would have laughed if she wouldn't have been so mad; he was treating them like teenagers.She rubbed Blakes back as he clutched the earth, holding on for dear life.As his body expelled the alcohol again and again, he began to cry.Lenny didnt feel it appropriate or beneficial for her to say anything.Im so sorry.Blake sobbed over and over again.Im sorry, Lenny...p pretty, pretty Lenny More heaving.Luke and Mike came around the corner of the bus.Lenny's heart caught slightly as she and Luke held eye contact.She knew she was mirroring the frown on his face but she didn't know what to say.He glanced up at the bus where she could still hear Carl yelling.Suddenly, Carl came stomping down the stairs and huffed out into the darkness.His lighter ignited his cigarette and then he paced around the parking lot like a caged animal, kicking rocks and randomly yelling.Luke went up inside the bus and took his turn yelling at Sway and Harrison.Lenny wasn't even surprised.She knew how deeply Luke cared for his mates.Mike slowly shuffled over and sat down near Blake with his back against a tree.You never did know when to stop, Mike remarked pensively.He let his head drop between his knees and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand.Lenny could tell Mike was thinking about more than just tonights incident.Her anger slowly dissipated and turned into compassion.They had seen their share of success and failure.They knew each other's ugly sides better than anyone.How hard it must be to see someone you care about slip into old habits, long conquered.She looked at Carl, still having a fit in the distance, and she understood his worries better.She was wrong.He wasnt being controlling, he was being realistic.At least we got there before he went full college coed on us.Lenny joked lightly.Yeah?Wheres his shirt?Mike raised his eyebrows pointedly.Lenny shrugged in mock confusion, making Mike laugh.I think Im dying.Blake moaned from the grass.Youre not dying, dont be so dramatic.Lenny rubbed his back as he hurled some more.Youre gonna be hella sick tomorrow, though.She added with a touch of sympathy in her voice.Blake groaned in response.How was the fishing?Lenny looked at Mike.Good.Mike's expression softened with the subject change.Peaceful.You do anything this exciting?She gestured to Blake.Mike chuckled, Not in a long time.Lenny motioned to Mike to help her get Blake, who had finally stopped vomiting, into a standing position.They helped him up the steps and into the bus, pushing past the lecture in the front room.Luke stopped yelling and assisted in getting Blake into his bunk.Lenny set a garbage can next to him and propped pillows behind his back so he was lying on his side.She took a seat on the floor and leaned against the opposite bunk.Ill stay with him tonight in case we need to go to the hospital.She was worried and annoyed at the same time.She should have taken Carl more seriously.How was she going to repair this?Harrison and Sway felt badly, it was obvious.They should feel bad.They had broken their promise to Carl, they lied to Lenny and now Blake had to be watched to make sure he didn't die in his own vomit.Mike nodded and headed for the door.He grabbed Lukes arm, pulling him with, on the way out.Luke stopped momentarily and touched Lennys shoulder.You sure?She nodded but couldn't look up at him.She felt too responsible for all of this.Luke paused just above her then he leaned down and kissed the top of her head.Youre amazing, he whispered in her ear before he followed Mike out of the bus.Lenny expelled the air in her lungs slowly.Lukes sweet gesture had sent shivers through her.She leaned her head back and stared at the ceiling.The lines between professionalism and friendship were tangling.But she was too tired to care at the moment.She watched Blakes sleeping form, his mouth hanging open.She was more upset that they had lied to her than she was about the drinking in general.I'm the worst kind of hypocrite, she thought bitterly.What kind of right did she have to be angry with them for lying when that's basically all she had done since she'd met them?She should have kept a closer visual on them.She hoped Carl wasnt going to fire her.It would probably depend on what the media reported tomorrow.Sway and Harrison hung their heads like ashamed puppies and went to bed without saying a word.Lenny knew she had scared them with her outburst and part of her was satisfied.She chuckled inwardly.If Sway hadn't stopped her she would have given that little douche bag a good thrashing.She hadnt let her anger get the better of her in a long time.It felt kinda good to unleash the back country girl, she had missed her.Mike sat on the couch across from Luke and contemplated how to address the growing concern he had for his band mate's feelings in regards to their new assistant.He had thought it was a brief crush, but now he wasn't so sure.Mike could see the attachment to her gaining strength and he didn't want to see his friend get hurt.Either one of them.What's going on with you and Lenny?Luke's eyebrows drew together and his mouth ticked up on one side.I'm not sure what you mean.Can you be more specific?Mike rolled his eyes.Was he really trying to play coy about this?It was definitely not his usual.C'mon, man.Mike scratched the back of his head in frustration.It's me.Luke took a deep breathe and looked down at the floor.He leaned forward, bracing his forearms on his knees and looked back up at Mike.His face was serious and almost inquisitive.He dropped his voice to just above a hush, like he was afraid someone would hear him.You know all those things we sing about?Love, passion, truth, beauty, life...?Mike nodded, feeling his frown deepen.Luke shook his head slightly, as if he didn't believe what he was about to say.He rubbed his face aggressively with one hand and chuckled sardonically at himself.When I look at Lenny...I feel like I finally know what those songs are talking about.He pushed back in his chair and closed his eyes, Do I sound completely crazy?Mike held back a smile and answered quietly, No, you don't sound crazy.Lenny left the bus early while everyone was still sleeping.She had a lot of time to think throughout the night as she watched over Blake.She was still disappointed that they had lied to her, but this wasnt her first experience with a bunch of guys hell bent on getting messed up.She had three older brothers, after all.And that didn't even cover half the things she'd seen grown men do when testosterone got involved.She went across the street to a local fast food restaurant and ordered copious amounts of greasy hash browns, breakfast sandwiches and coffee.She had one of the employees help her transport her large order, promising him a free CD in return.Carl was waiting in his usual spot for coffee.It was a relief to Lenny because she wasnt sure how mad he was at her from the night before.She handed him his coffee and waved him into the Red Bus where she deposited the rest of her bundle.She thanked the employee for his help and gave him the CD.Arent you the girl who tried to knock out Travis Cline last night?The kid asked, referring to the lead singer of Juniper Highlights that Lenny had attacked outside the bar.The kid had stars in his eyes; he was acting like he had just met a celebrity.Were you there?Lenny asked, eying him suspiciously.He looked too young to have been at the bar.Nah, my buddy sent me the video in my email.He held up his phone and showed Lenny a grainy replay of her outburst and Sway throwing her into the back of the van.She tried to feign indifference.Its not what it looks like.Cmon, that was awesome!The kid argued.Carl gently grabbed the young mans elbow, unsuccessfully trying to hide his smirk.Take your CD, kid.Thanks for the help.He turned him over to security at the bottom of the stairs to continue his exit.I thought we should have a family meeting, she started to explain, ignoring what had just happened with the internet video as she unpacked her purchases on the table top.Im not mad at you, Lenny.Carl got her to look at him.You have every right to be, Carl.I let you down.Carl gave a lopsided grin, No, actually, you didnt.Lenny frowned at him and he continued.I watched all the media coverage of last nights incident and no one has video of Blakes King of the Castle speech.But there is video everywhere of a blonde bad ass attempting to take out Travis Cline.Lennys face fell, Oh, no.Carl laughed, Its alright, Len.You saved the day.He laughed again at her horrified expression.Im just glad Sway got to you before you could do any real damage and I had to bail you out of jail.Lenny finally saw the humor in it and let out a small laugh herself.Yeah, I woulda hurt him pretty bad.What she didn't say, was that her reason for panic was two fold.If she was identified in that video it could cause even more trouble.I'm sure the sponsors would love that kind of publicity.They heard a groan from Blakes bunk, interrupting Lenny's thoughts and she went to help him up.What the f .Blake was holding his head and trying to sit upright.Cmon, your Majesty, Lenny helped him up and to bathroom.When she heard the toilet flush she reminded, Make sure you wash your hands.She was talking too loudly on purpose and Carl chuckled.Blake staggered out of the small bathroom and Lenny led him to the booth of waiting food.His face turned up at the smell and he tried to pull away.No, no, no.Lenny prodded, You have a show tonight and you need a healthy breakfast.She unwrapped the hash browns for him and raised an expectant eyebrow.Blake grimaced but surrendered and took a bite.After a few more small tastes he started eating normally and even asked for some coffee.Lenny sat next to him in the booth and put her hand on his back.She ignored Carl's watchful eye.If she expected these guys to be upfront with her from now on, she was going to have to let some of her own walls come down.Carl texted Luke and Mike to join them and he pulled Sway and Harrison from their bunks, literally.He was obviously still mad at them.They all gathered around the food silently.Carl let them eat for awhile before he spoke.Last night was stupid.His voice was calm but serious.The only thing that saved your asses from a full blown media evisceration was this girl, right here, going all Chuck Norris on that idiot.He pointed at Lenny and the guys snickered quietly.Weve got a few more months before we can call it a day, you know what I mean?They all nodded.The air was quiet and Lenny was again struck with compassion for the guys.While she was mad that they lied to her and Blake had come dangerously close to alcohol poisoning, she understood how badly they needed to expel some energy.They were rock stars after all.Thanks, Len.Blake gestured with his food and then looked down at the table.Dont think youre off the hook with me, Lenny was stern, Im still angry with you.She sighed, but I get it, more than you know.Mikes brow furrowed at her slight confession and he exchanged a look with Luke who shrugged.Lenny didn't feel the need to explain herself.The time for that would come later.Next time you feel the need to prove your manhood, come and see me first.I have some alternatives that might interest you.She slid out of the booth and started for the door.Where you goin?Sway asked.I smell like a bar floor, I have to shower.You guys need to get your act together.Just because last night was rough doesnt mean you can slack off at your show.She almost cringed at how much she sounded like her father.Lenny left the bus while Blake swallowed another sandwich nearly whole and wiped his lips.That chick is a genius; this food is a miracle cure.He belched loudly.Shes a lot stronger than she looks.Sway said, tearing into a sandwich himself.Ive never seen anyone so pissed, Harrison agreed.I wonder what she did before joining us, Sway mused.Probably UFC, Harrison said, half serious.Regardless, this should be a good lesson for all of you, Carl interrupted gruffly.Dont cross her.She will mess you up.They all nodded solemnly and he added, She was mad when we got there but she didnt Hulk Out till she heard that asshat talking shit to Blake.You all know Lenny to be level headed and focused.Turns out, her line is you.Carl let his words settle over them before he excused himself.The guys chewed quietly for a few minutes, thinking about what Carl had just said.Blake cleared his throat, Um, Luke?He said hesitantly.Yeah, buddy?I dont remember a lot from last nightbut Im pretty sure I told your girlfriend to kiss me.Light laughter erupted around the table.Luke rolled his eyes.Shes not my girl.Not yet.Mike replied quickly, causing more laughter.Lets just drop that whole train of thought right now, okay?Luke was trying to look as serious as possible but the side of his mouth kept turning up.Lenny is off limits to all of us, remember?Why ya smiling?Harrison ribbed.Go to hell.Luke picked up his coffee and left his band mates laughing behind him.He went outside and stood in the warm sunshine, trying to push their comments out of his mind.He knew they were right; he couldnt stay away from Lenny.He just didnt want them to talk about it so much.He saw Lenny exit the crew bus, her bag slung over her shoulder.She looked around, taking inventory of her surroundings, having negligible eye contact with Luke, and headed to the backstage area.Luke barely hesitated, jogging to catch up with her.Hey, he said falling in step beside her.She flashed a quick smile but kept moving, clearly on business.Scouting for a shower?He anticipated her destination.I can usually sneak into one.She grinned at him and he fought back the urge to hug her.You can use our shower.He volunteered, already knowing what she would say.That would be a bad idea, she replied.Besides, I like the adventure of finding one.I feel like I earned my shower that way.I just wanted to say thanks for all you did last night for Blake.I know it couldnt have been fun watching over him all night.Luke's words came out hurried and nervous.It's not like I was going to sleep anyway.She held up her coffee, Thank God for caffeine, am I right?Luke shoved his hands in his pocket, trying to figure out how to ask why she had blamed herself for Blakes actions last night.And why she had gone to such great lengths to protect him.I know it wasnt my fault that Blake acted like a colossal moron last night, Lenny said as if reading Lukes thoughts.I just know that if I woulda been there, it wouldnt have happened.They rounded a corner and Lenny stopped to face Luke.They had just enough privacy so that no one could hear them but not enough for anyone to think something else was going on between them.What about the Street Fighter routine, whered that come from?Luke was genuinely curious.He saw the video on the news this morning and couldnt help but wonder at this mysterious woman who had worked her way into their daily lives.I told you I have three older brothers, right?Luke nodded.Nathan is a MMA instructor and he thought I should have a basic knowledge for self defense.I just let my temper get the better of me last night.Lenny shook her head with embarrassment.I guess you were right, Im part of the family now.I couldnt stand to hear someone ridicule one of my brothers.I wanted to take him out.Luke chuckled, wishing he could have been there to see it in person.Now, I have to go find a shower and get this...ick off of me.Lenny made a face as she glanced down at her messy clothes.She pointed her coffee at him, Don't follow me, we can't have people talking.Luke nodded and she gave him a half smile and turned down a darkened hallway.He watched her until she was completely out of sight.He knew she was right, but that didn't stop him from wanting to be around her all the time.She was completely amazing.And a little dangerous.And he couldnt get enough.5    Falling      Lenny took up her usual post in the sound booth with Greg, the sound engineer.Her inability to do any laundry the last couple of weeks had left her with a ratty pair of jeans and a vintage Lynyrd Skynyrd t shirt she had stolen from her brother, Scott, years ago.Her long blonde hair was in a loose mess around her shoulders due to Luke's 'request' that she not wear the braid anymore.She hated to admit it, but her headaches had gotten substantially better.She found herself on her feet, swaying her hips to the music and singing along with every song.This band, their music, had always pulled deeply at her soul.She found it difficult to keep up the depiction of stoic observation, like a good employee should, when they took the stage.She could get lost in the words, the beat, the melody...Something about Luke Casey's velvety voice had an energizing yet calming effect on her.It filled her senses like the fresh pine blowing through the trees back home...After the accident, she had found little to no comfort in those around her.But Double Blind Study on her play list made her feel like she wasn't alone.Someone out there understood what she was going through.Her friends only added to the pain she was going through and DBS became her safe place.Now, here she was, on tour with them, eating with them, watching over them, taking care of them.They would never know how much they had taken care of her over the past two years.When she went into that interview weeks ago she never dreamed that she would end up here.The crowd was insane.Bodies jumping up and down and slam dancing without stop.Crowd surfers kept popping up and making their way from one side of the pit to the other.The band played three encore songs and the fans went wild.Lenny smiled with satisfaction, knowing that last nights incident had just drawn a larger crowd.The band had a small meet and greet after the show before they could get on the road.They had limited the amount of after show events because of time restrictions so this was a rare occurrence.Less than ten people, a few radio winners and some friends of Carl's that had driven nearly ten hours from Hartford.Lenny's eyes kept being drawn back to the threesome that had arrived with Carl's backstage passes.The tall, dark haired girl was lively and friendly, dragging the shorter brunette girl with her in happy exuberance.The short girl seemed...detached.She looked uncomfortable and politely irritated by her surroundings.Like she had something far more important on her mind.The lone guy in the trio chain smoked almost as much as Carl.Lenny saw Sway zero in on Tall Girl and she made her way that direction to intercept.Sway had barely said a word and the girl's happy face changed to annoyed in a second.Lenny quickened her pace.Sway was going to get slapped one of these days.Why did he think he could hit on anyone?You're feisty, I like it.Sway's lip curled up and Lenny saw Tall Girl take on a more combative stance.Hi, I'm Lenny.Lenny stepped in between them and stuck out her hand.You must be Carl's friends from Hartford.Tall Girl shook her hand and turned her glare into a more pleasant expression again.I'm E, she introduced herself.I only met Carl today.She pointed with her thumb over her shoulder at the guy looking too cool for school, David got the tickets.Lenny, I was having a conversation.Sway leaned over her shoulder and gave her a scolding look.E's glare returned and Lenny's smile widened to an uncomfortable degree of fakery that hurt her cheeks.Let's get you guys a drink.She turned E and her friends towards the refreshments table.When they had taken a few steps, she turned and grabbed Sway with two fistfuls of his shirt.She's going to kill you, Sway, Lenny warned in all seriousness, You have to back off.Take it easy, Sway's grin was adorably nave.He really thought he could get anyone.He brushed off Lenny's grip and headed after E again.Lenny wanted to stop him but she also kind of wanted to see what was going to happen.As the evening progressed and things began to wrap up, Lenny was amazed at E's restraint.She would have clocked him by now.Lenny found out that E was a personal trainer and they exchanged different tips and techniques.Sway's jealousy was apparent.
