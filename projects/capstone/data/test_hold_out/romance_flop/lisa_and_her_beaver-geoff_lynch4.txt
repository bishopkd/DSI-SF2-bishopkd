No, now get out of my restaurant, the manager said.Youre beaver is causing too many problems.13   Art Class      Now hold on, Lisa pleaded.Im not responsible for what my beaver does.Is he with you or not?the manager asked.Sort of, not exactly, I only know him a little.He says hes related to you.Hes a beaver, cant you see the difference?Lisa said as she pointed at herself.Ok, hes not your brother, but I cant have him disturbing my regular customers, the manager said.Ill talk to him, let me get my food and I promise hell shut up.Fine, you have ten min, now hurry up, the managers said and he walked back into the kitchen.Pissed, Lisa had to get her food much faster than she wanted too and didnt get the time she wanted to pick through the buffet like usual.She filled her plate, grabbed some  rolls, and scurried back to the booth where Toby was waiting for her.Did you tell people I was your retarded sister?she asked.Caught, Toby avoided eye contact and played with his chopsticks.Im talking to you, you fucking oversized rat!Toby looked Lisa in the eye and said, I may have, I cant be for certain, I have these spells.Spells my ass, youre trying to make money off me calling me stupid!What does it matter?Money is money.You almost got us kicked out!Lisa yelled.Sorry, I didnt know, wheres my sticks and bark?Toby asked.If they have any, I didnt see it, he gave me ten minutes to clear this up or he was kicking us out.What am I supposed to do?Apologize?Toby asked.Lisa looked over at the door to the kitchen, the manager was standing halfway out looking at her.She gave him a thumbs up and he went back inside.We lucked out on that one, dont do it again.Might be too late, Toby said.I got you a gig as a nude art model.How in the hell did you do that?I was only gone for a few minutes.When you got up to get the food, a girl came over and asked if you did any nude art modeling, I said all the time.She asked how much and I said two hundred an hour.She said she wanted to book you tonight.Did you do a background check on her?Lisa asked.I dont have a smartphone, no I didnt do a background check on her.Toby replied.Its two hundred bucks and all you have to do is sit there and let someone draw you.I think you should be thanking me, not bitching me out.Fine, but you have to guard me the whole time, are you able to do that?Do you have any training?Lisa asked.I took a class on self defense for women once at the Optimist club.Why?Lisa asked.It was free and they served a free lunch, Toby replied.What did you learn from this class?Lisa asked.I learned a lot of stuff.Such as?That the heel of a high heel shoe can take a man's eyeball out, Toby replied.What else?That kicking a guy in the nuts can give you enough time to escape.Thats pretty basic stuff, what did they teach you I dont already know?Lisa asked.Toby picked at his food and thought hard.He picked some more and then at a noodle.This is good, I should have been eating Chinese a long time ago.Fuck twigs and leaves.Stop avoiding the question, what else do you know?Lisa asked.Thats about it, I didnt pay much attention, I was there for the free lunch, Toby replied.Now are you going to do the gig or not?If Im going to be your manager, you need to let me know what youre willing to do.If I book you on a porn shoot, will you have sex with vegetables?How did you jump from modeling at an art class to fucking cucumbers?Lisa asked.Because this isnt really an art class, its a porn shoot, Toby replied.Porn?Who is this girl?Dont know, but from her business card, I think she works freelance, Toby replied.Let me see the card, Lisa said with her hand outstretched.Toby handed the card over to Lisa and she took a look at it.It was a plain white card with pen marks on it.This is homemade, and looks like she cut up some printer paper and scribbled a phone number and address on it.There isnt a business name on it anywhere.Its porn, they tend not to want to leave a trail if you know what I mean.No, what do you mean?Lisa asked.Some of the folk in porn are a bit unsavory.Lisa bit her lip and took a sip of her soda.No shit, she replied and started eating her food.Are you going to eat?she asked.Are you going to do the shoot?Toby asked.What does it involve?You and three girls baking a cake.And then?Not sure, I didnt get to see the script.How about a synopsis?Lisa asked.Im sure it has to do with you licking or fingering somebody, its not Shakespeare.For this I get two hundred dollars?Yes, Toby replied.When do I get paid?She didnt say but these are usually pay after play sorts of deals.Cash?Dont know, they have to account for their payouts, may be a check.Cash only, and I wear a mask.That might be a deal breaker, nobody wants to see a chick getting banged wearing a mask, she might pay fifty for that, Toby replied.Where is she?Lisa asked.Get her over here.Toby looked over Lisas shoulder and made a gestured to someone behind her.Shes coming, Toby said.In an instant, a four hundred pound black woman slid her giant ass into the booth seat next to Lisa knocking her into the side window.Did you talk to her?the woman asked.Yeah, I think shell do it for cash, Toby said.The woman looked at Lisa and scanned her body.Hi, my name is Tanisha, whats yours?Lisa, Lisa said.Did your friend tell you I was interested in hiring you for a little art project?she asked with her hands in quotes.He said you wanted me to have sex with three other women on tape for two hundred dollars.We were still negotiating the price, I think two hundred is way out of line.What were you thinking?Lisa asked.Seventy five, maybe a hundred if you let them fuck you with a baseball bat, Tanisha replied.Oh fuck no!Lisa said.For that, a thousand.I could get ten women in this place to do that for a thousand, I cant just pay everyone a thousand, money doesnt grow on trees honey and your pussy isnt worth all that much, youve been giving it away for free ever since youve been in here.For seventy five, Ill let one girl touch my nipple, with a finger, Lisa said.Never mind, Ill find someone else, Tanisha said.Wait, ok, Ill let two women lick one nipple each.No, you will let them fuck the shit out of you with whatever they want and like it.Its a ten minute video and Ill pay you cash as soon as we make sure we got it on tape.I want one twenty five, Lisa said.For that you have to fuck your little beaver friend here, bestiality sells pretty good.I dont think so, Lisa said.Im going to finish my lunch and go to the clothing store, Im taking my beaver with me, but Im not fucking it, not for seventy five bucks.Tanisha got up and left leaving Lisa with her beaver, Toby.How dare you try to sell me to some porn place for seventy five bucks, she said with a mouthful of noodles.Not my fault shes so cheap, Toby replied.He tried some sort of chicken and loved it.Man, I think I was lied too, this is so much better than bark.Hurry up, I want to get to the clothing store, Ive been naked way too long.I also need a shower.Yeah, you might want to skip the clothes and get a hotel room, you might have clothes on your back, but nowhere to sleep.With clothes on my back, I can ask around and find a place to sleep without someone thinking they can rape me.Touch, Toby said.Im done, lets go.Lisa and Toby paid their bill and headed down the mall to the womens clothing store, she walked inside and was greeted by a very over made bitchy salesgirl.What can I do for you?the clerk asked looking Lisa up and down like a chicken leg.I need a tank top, pair of shorts, bra and panty set and some flip flops, Lisa replied.What do you think this is?Old navy?The clerk replied laughing.We dont sell crap.Im on a budget, I cant afford some high priced outfit.From the looks of you, I dont think you need an outfit at all, you look like you just stepped out of the jungle, you Jane?I dont like your attitude, Lisa said calmly.I dont like your leg hair, the clerk snapped back.And your beaver friend here?We dont allow pets in here.Hes not my pet.Is that right?the clerk said looking down at Toby.Toby took a few steps forward and tugged on the clerks dress, Fuck you, he said and yanked it down ripping it at her hip.The clerk backed up and ran to the register and grabbed a stun gun.She pointed it at Toby and pulled the trigger striking a rack of shoes behind him.You suck, Toby said.The clerk threw the gun at Toby and yelled for the assistant manager to come.In a few seconds a short fat woman with way too much make up walked up to the clerk and asked what happened.This rat attacked me!the clerk said.Is that right?Did you attack her?the assistant manager asked.No, Toby said.Ok, get your ass back to work princess, the assistant manager said.And get that stun gun rolled back up, I dont want the customers tripping over the wires.Toby looked at the clerk and smiled.Stupid bitch, he said and was kicked across the room by the clerk and her hard heels.Toby landed on his back looking up at the ceiling in a daze and struggled to get back up.It was then he spied an Old Navy down the hall next to a record store.He had a hard time wondering if he was really conscience since he thought record stores were like dinosaurs.Are you ok?Lisa asked, she was bent over looking at Toby who was on the floor with his eyes rolling back and forth.Toby looked up and saw her tits rocking back and forth like to synchronized pendulums.Once his eyes were locked on her nipples, he couldnt look at anything else.It was like trying to not look at a car wreck.Yeah, Ill be fine, help me up, Toby said.Lisa gave Toby a hand and helped him back up.For a moment, Toby walked like a drunk beaver with little balance.Youre so cute when you do that, Lisa said.Theres an Old Navy down the hall, lets go, Toby said and together they left the store and headed down the hall.Id save the money for a hotel if I were you, Toby said.14   Evil Forces      Anne gagged a little when she looked at the umbilical cord lying on the floor until she realized it was a rubber hose painted to look like an umbilical cord complete with fake teeth marks and blue veins.Thats not real, Anne said to Candye who was now leaning up against the cell door looking out.So, you figured me out did you?Candye said slow and deliberate.Not really, I have no idea what youre doing, Anne replied.Candye continued to stare through the bars into the grey hallway.Im a messenger from Satan, she said, keeping her eyes locked on the wall across the hall.And what does old Satan have to say today?Anne asked.Satan put us in this cell together for a reason, Ive come to deliver a personal message to you about your daughter Lisa.Anne perked up, What the fuck?she asked.Lisa is in great danger.What kind of danger?Anne asked like a concerned mother who hadnt seen her adult daughter in three years.Shes in a mall with a huge rat, evil forces are all around her, tempting her, trying to take her away.What kind of evil forces?Anne asked pleading.Well, for one thing shes hanging out with a giant rat, that cant be good.What else?Anne asked.Shes naked, and looking for clothes.Is she looking for nice clothes?She usually dresses like a slut.She is in a mini mall, heading for an Old Navy, but there is no Old Navy, the store is still under construction.She is lost and doesnt know it yet.Are there any other clothing stores in the mall?Ann asked.Yes, but they were kicked out of that one, the closest womens store is across the parking lot next to a Taco Bell.So?Anne asked.The land the Taco Bell was built on was an old Romanian graveyard, its cursed by the spirit of the man who founded Lancaster.His bones are still buried under the building.Lancaster?Where is that?Anne asked.I dont know for sure, its a lost city, connected by a secret tunnel built by the Romanian founders hundreds of years ago, no one knows for sure where it is.But Lisa found it somehow, Anne replied.Yes, her and the rat traveled through the tunnel and are now trapped in the city of Lancaster.How do I get her back?If she enters the Taco Bell it wont matter, she wont survive.Evil spirits have gathered to remove her presence from Lancaster and send her back to Sparksville in a bag, Candy replied.There is no way I can stop her?Anne pleaded.A second ago you were telling me I was nuts because I was claiming to have a baby, and now all of a sudden you believe your daughter is going to be killed in a Taco Bell in a town youve never heard of before?Well, how did you know I had a daughter named Lisa?Anne asked.Its tattooed on your arm, next to another girl's name.Why did you choose Lisa instead of Trish?Anne asked.Why not?Candye replied.So you just made that all up?Arent all visions made up?No, theyre supposed to be divine, not some crap you pulled out of your head.Well I dont know, it came to me and there you go, Candye replied.Do with it what you will.Even if it were true, there isnt a damn thing I can do about it sitting in here, Anne said frustrated.You put yourself in here, dont bitch.I know, but I didnt know my daughter was about to be killed in a Taco Bell in a town I never heard of before.There is one salvation.What?Another vision?Yep, be quiet, Im getting one now, Candye said as she stared off blankly.The huge rat can save your daughter, Im not sure if he will, but there is a chance she may be saved yet.I wish you knew more about this rat, it really bothers me that shes hanging around with it.He seems friendly, I wouldnt be worried, if he was going to hurt her, shed be hurt by now.Thank goodness this might turn out ok, I was so worried for a second there, Anne said.Dont relax too soon, this might turn out very bad if things dont go just right.Your daughter is in great peril.Well thanks for that, just what I needed, I was starting to feel ok about being here and now I think I better bust out.I wouldnt try that, these places are very secure, Candye said.Thats why I tried the rubber umbilical cord card, didnt get me anywhere with you, probably wont get me anywhere with the chief.You admit you faked that?What about eating your baby?No, I ate my baby, that part is true, Candye replied.How can you eat your baby?Anne asked, No, dont tell me.What do you say we talk about something else?Just then the loud sound of clopping footsteps came walking down the hall.From the swagger, Anne knew it wasnt the police chief, it was the sheriff, Axl Jackson.The law enforcement center and jail was co shared by the local police and the county sheriffs department.The sheriff stopped at Annes cell and motioned for the door to be open.With a clunk and a clank, the door slid open and the sheriff stepped in.What do you want now sheriff?Anne asked.Im not here for you this time, Im here for the cannibal queen, the sheriff replied.Did you ever find my daughter, Anne asked.Which one?The slutty one or the druggie?The slutty one, I know where the druggie one is, Anne replied.No clue, probably out making a porno is some guys barn.What do you teach those girls anyway?Fuck off, Anne said and tried to find a place to sit down not covered in piss.Miss Kane, the sheriff said.We need you in court in twenty minutes, the sheriff said.He tossed another orange jumpsuit at her and said, Put this on, you cant go in front of the judge dressed in piss stains.Candye caught the jumpsuit and smiled at the sheriff.Ill piss on this one too, she said dropping it on the floor.She unzipped the jumpsuit she was wearing, pulled it down to her ankles and squatted down to pee on the clothes the sheriff brought.When she was done she stood up and zipped up the suit she had on.There you go, she said pointing to the pissed on heap on the floor.I figured youd do something like that, he said.He stepped out of the cell for a moment and walked back in with a clear polyurethane jumpsuit.Put this on, its pee proof.You can see right through it, Candye said.I dont have any more options, this is more to protect the court staff than to make you look good.I cant have you passing your bodily functions to anyone who might be around.Youll have to wear this spit guard as well.Im not wearing that, Candye said defiantly.Oh, yes you are, the sheriff replied.Whos going to make me?Candye snapped back.The sheriff clicked his radio and said, Now.In a flash a group of five men, dressed in black protective gear rushed the cell and pinned Candye to the ground.The men stripped her down, put on the plastic suit and spit guard.Once in place, they put her in wrist cuffs and ankle cuffs.Get her off the ground, the sheriff said and the men raised her to her feet.She stood before him dressed only in a see through plastic suit, a spit guard and restraints.Thats going to get very hot very fast lady, dont try to fight, dont fuck around, any movement will cause you to heat up and you may get heat exhaustion.Candye looked at the sheriff with anger and disdain, how dare he tie her up?She thought to herself.Get her out of here, the sheriff said and watched as his men escorted Candye out the cell door and down the hallway to the courtroom.Sheriff, Anne asked.Have you ever heard of the town of Lancaster?The sheriff stood thinking, he knew the answer right away.Lancaster was wiped off the planet in the tornado of forty two.No way, where was it before the tornado?About seventy five miles northeast, the sheriff replied.Whats there now?Theres a few buildings, a windmill or two, not much, it was torn to pieces, the sheriff replied.That woman just told me that Anne was there, in Lancaster.Why would she be there?There isnt anything there to do, or see.I dont know, but she sounded pretty sure of herself, is there any way you can check to see if shes there?Anne asked.No, nobody lives there anymore, there is no one to call, the sheriff replied.Whats the closest town to Lancaster?Sparksville, the sheriff replied, and youre standing in the middle of it.Anne shook her head realizing she put too much faith in Candye and her story.Never mind, that nutty fruitcake was just putting ideas in my head.If you hear anything about Lisa, will you let me know?Anne asked.Sure, tell me something, whats this I hear about you shooting your husband and some gay prostitute?the sheriff asked.Roger was trying to pick up a John with me in the car that was after he butt fucked some stranger in the womens department at the clothing store.You didnt know Roger was queer?No, we had regular sex all the time, he didnt act gay at all, Anne replied.Thats too bad, I used to kick him out of the men's restrooms down at the city park almost every Saturday night.He and his friends had quite the operation going on.What are you talking about?He was down at the fire hall playing cards, Anne said.No, he was in the toilet stall giving blow jobs to strangers, the sheriff replied.If thats true, why didnt he ever get caught?He got caught all the time, but we had to let him go because hes a good friend of the city administrator.And?Dont get me wrong, if hed of done that queer shit on county property, Id have busted his queer ass in a second, he was smart, he always did his butt fucking on city property.That is the citys jurisdiction, not mine.Im sure the city administrator was in on it, I think at one point they found out he was sneaking out to the public bathrooms in a rental car so he wouldnt get found out.So the city administrator and my dead husband used to fuck in the public toilet down at the city park?Anne asked in disgust.Pretty much, sorry to be the one to tell you.Great, everyone knew but me.Dont worry about it, hes dead now, you killed the cheating bastard.Yep, Anne said.Doesnt change the past.15   Paddle Boat      Judd sat at a picnic table tied to one of the legs.Sam brought out some potato salad and set it next to a plate of ham.I hope you like picnics, she said with a smile.It was about six oclock and Ricardo and the two other hands had gone back to the barn for supper.The hogs were tended to for the night.I do, but just potato salad and ham?Judd asked.What else do you want?How about some beans, and some chips?What do you think this is?A buffet?Sam said with a snarl on her face.Judd looked over to the hog pen and saw the hog he was talking to earlier, he didnt get his name.He could tell by the hogs expression that he had better cool down before he ended up as livestock feed.No, thats fine, ham and potato salad are fine.Stop lying to me, Sam said.You want fucking beans, Ill make you fucking beans!she shouted loud enough for the hogs to stop snorting and take notice.I dont want your fucking beans!Judd shouted back.Sam walked around to where Judd was sitting and sat on the table top letting her boots rest on the bench seat.How many times do you want to do it tonight?she asked.Zero, Judd replied.Dont fuck with me asshole, now give me a number I can use.Fifty, Judd said being an ass.Fifty?I can give that a shot, no promises, Sam said running her finger over Judds ear.You want to look up my skirt?she asked.No, Judd asked.I think we should do it on this table once were done eating, she said.I dont want to get splinters in my knees.You bitch about everything dont you?Can I go home now?Judd asked.This is your home now, Sam replied.Bullshit, my family is worried about me, you need to get your henchmen off my back and untie me.You said wed fuck fifty times, youre not going anywhere till I collect all fifty, Sam said.Why dont you fuck one of your help?I bet theyd help you out.Ive tried, I dont think they get my hints.Dont be so subtle, walk over to the barn naked and point at your coochie, theyll get it.I tried that once, they gave me a glass of milk and pointed me to the bathroom, I think they thought I had a yeast infection, Sam said disappointed.Well Im sorry, no, actually Im not, if you werent such a freak, youd find a man.Hell, you came up to me yesterday wearing a wrestling unitard, what woman does that?Who wants to be with a woman who dresses like a high school wrestler?You dont think Im feminine enough?Sam asked.You make my dick limp if thats what you mean, Judd replied.Maybe I should put on a pretty dress, and some lipstick.Maybe you should, and while you're at it, call a surgeon to fix that flab hanging off your pussy.Thats a huge turn off.I dont like your attitude, Sam said.I think you may need an adjustment.What does that mean?Wait here, Sam said knowing he was tied to the hundred pound table.Judd ate ham and potato salad while Sam was inside.It was a nice evening and there was a cool breeze blowing in.Then she returned with a whip in her hand.What are you doing with that?Judd asked.Im going to whip you into a better attitude, Sam replied.You think whipping me will make me like you better?Judd asked.I dont need you to like me, I need you to fuck me, now bend over the table, and this is going to hurt like hell.Sam pulled back on the whip and it didnt go far.She wasnt tall enough to make the nine foot whip do anything but lie on the ground.She tried different ways to get it to whip but it just dragged around kicking up dirt.Fuck, how do you do this?she asked.I think its broke, Judd said.Better put it back where you found it.It's not broke, Ive seen Ricardo use it before.Not wanting her to get Ricardo, Judd had to think fast.Its a Mexican style bullwhip, only Mexicans can use it, and only on Mexican bulls.Its a tradition, dont fuck with it.Really?Sam said.I had no idea.Yeah, put it back in the house.You dont want to ruin it, probably worth a lot of money.Those are made of quality leather.How do you know?Sam asked.Look at it, Judd said.You can tell by looking?How else can you tell?Satisfied, Sam took the whip back to the house and came back with a belt.Horrified, Judd couldnt think of anything clever to say about that.I found this belt, I think it will work better, now lean forward, she said.Judd leaned forward and Sam began striking the belt across his back over and over.Then she realized shed get a bigger bang for her buck if she raised his shirt so she stepped over and just as she got there, Judd spun around and grabbed her by the arm and pulled the belt from her hand.You fucking bitch!Judd yelled and pulled her into the table slamming her head on the hard wood seat.He was still tied to the table but now had the knife from Sams tool belt and used it to cut the cord that kept him prisoner.In a flash, he was untied and running down the path to the driveway that led to the gravel road towards town.Sam rolled over and felt blood on her face, she was dazed and pissed at the same time.By now Judd was past the house and on his way to the road, she had to get him back before he got away and turned her in for kidnapping.She scrambled to her feet and ran to the horse pen, there wasnt time to saddle one, but she did grab a lasso that was hanging on a peg and mounted her horse Paddle boat.Once atop her horse, she took off in a gallop towards the house and Judd who was now past the mailbox.Judd was exhausted but knew he couldnt let up, he knew shed follow him so he looked for places he could use to ditch her, like a ditch.As he ran, he saw endless landscapes of farmland with little to use to hide.Everywhere he looked it was corn, or milo, surrounded by barb wire fences and drainage ditches.There really was nowhere to hide.Then he heard the clip clop sounds of a horse behind him, he turned to look as he ran and saw Sam spinning her lasso readying herself for an attempt to rope him in mid run.Fuck he said winded and ran into the ditch trying to throw her off, as his feet left the gravel and touched the grass of the ditch he felt the lasso hit his head with a thump and fall to the ground.He knew she missed.Down into the ditch and up the other side Judd ran till he got to the barb wire fence, it would take a minute to pull the wires apart so he could get through, a minute that Sam could use to make another attempt.As he pulled, he tried to keep his hands off the barbs and was shocked at how tight the wires were and how close they were to each other.How the fuck was he going to get through?His only other option was to try to crawl over the top and that meant scraping the shit out himself on the way over.Then he felt the lasso grab him and tighten as it pulled him backwards, away from the fence and down into the ditch.She got him, and how he was being dragged back onto the gravel road scraping the shit out of his exposed skin.About thirty feet more and the horse stopped and Judd lay there in agony.He was sandpapered on the bottom and the rope dug in and pulled so hard his joints felt like they were going to give way.Sam dismounted and ran over to Judd who was still lying on the ground bound tight.Where do you think youre going?she yelled.She still had blood on her face.Judd looked up at her and didnt say a word.Sam kicked Judd in the side and yelled again, You better talk to me asshole!Where were you going?Back to town you stupid bitch!Judd snapped back.Oh no you arent, not after what you did back there.You hit a woman, what kind of creepy asshole hits a woman?What kind of psycho bitch chases a guy with a horse and ties him up like a cow?Psycho bitch?Sam said laughing.You dont know anything about me.I know enough, Judd said.Do you have a psychology degree?No, I dont need one, anyone can tell your nuts.Sam stood there looking down at Judd, she didnt know how she was going to get him back to the farm, she cant drag him all the way, hed die, and he wasnt going back on his own, now what?Get up, were going back to the farm, She said.Judd stood up and let the lasso fall to the ground, he was covered on his backside by gravel and blood.Im not going back, I never should have ran in the first place, all you have is a rope and a horse, unless you have your Mexicans in your back pocket, Ill be heading for the nearest hospital.Wait, Sam said, now more subdued and coy, Let me help.Judd looked at her like she had just turned into a pumpkin, What?he asked like she was a big hairy joke, You did this to me, why the hell should I let you help?Im sorry, I didnt mean to hurt you, I was scared.Yeah, scared I was going to turn your ass in for kidnapping, which I still am.You dont have to do that.I dont have to do a lot of things, but that I am, now leave me alone.I can get Ricardo, hell hunt you down if I ask, you might as well give up, Sam said.What happened to being sorry?Judd asked.I am sorry, do you think I wanted to hurt you?I love you.No, actually I dont think you wanted to hurt me, you were scared and did the first knee jerk thing you could think of, and no, you dont love me, youre a nutjob that thinks you love me, now goodbye, Judd said turning to leave.No!Dont leave me!I want to have your babies!Sam yelled.Judd turned and looked back.I want to marry you and have lots of kids.I need surgery, I think I ruptured something, now get the fuck away from me, go back to your hogs and leave me alone.Disappointed, Sam walked over to Judd and raised her shirt exposing her breasts, You dont want to give these up do you?she asked.Trying to lure me back with sex wont work, Im so fucked up right now that I can barely walk, let alone have sex, so cover those up and leave me alone.Fine, Sam said.She turned and walked back to her horse leaving Judd behind.Judd turned and slowly walked down the gravel road towards town.The road burns from being scraped along the gravel were now so painful that every step was agony.But he knew he had to get to town and get his wounds looked at, he was going to get a raging infection with all the exposed and torn up skin.I suppose youll call the sheriff on me, Sam said.Go ahead, do what you want, I dont need you anyway.she said turning her horse back to town.She got the horse up to speed in a trot and left Judd behind.He turned back to see her leave and then back to the long road ahead.He had to walk six miles back to town and didnt know if hed make it.The only reason why she let him go was probably because she knew it as well and would come back later with her Mexicans to pick him up off the road.Then he noticed the vultures above circling.These werent for me?he asked himself, Shit, Im not that bad off.16   Madam Jane      Toby and Lisa left the mall and headed towards the Old Navy, then they noticed the Under construction sign and were both disappointed.Fuck, now what?Lisa asked.Lets keep looking around, Toby said and they kept walking down the polished floor looking at the different shops.Then Toby saw something that made him freak.Look, its one of those psychic palm reading places!he said like a giddy school boy.Can we go in?he asked like he was asking his mother for candy.Those places are so fake, Id rather not, Lisa said.I know theyre fake, but I want to try, it will be fun.Lisa stood there thinking, What the hell, but I cant spend any of my money, I need it for clothes.I have some money, Toby said.Where did you get money?Lisa asked.I took some tip money off the table at the Chinese place, got five bucks.Five bucks wont get you far in that place.Together, the two walked over to the psychic shop and went inside.They looked at the price list and Toby was very disappointed.The cheapest thing on the list was a palm reading for thirty five dollars.Then a clerk came out from the back.May I help you?she asked.No, I was just looking, Toby said disappointed.We have a special today, readings are twenty dollars.I only have five, Toby said.Sorry to bother you.No, you arent bothering me, I can make you a deal, today we will run a special just for you, and we dont get many rats in here.Im not a rat, Im a beaver, Toby said.Oh, I am very sorry, I meant for beavers, let me get Madam Jane for you, the clerk said.In a minute, Madam Jane appeared wearing what looked like a modified Gypsy costume complete with a head bandana and earrings that hung six inches off her ear.When she looked at Toby, her eyes lit up like she had just seen a million dollars.Hello, I hear there is a beaver looking for a reading?she asked.Yes, but I only have five dollars, Toby said.You can talk?Madam Jane asked.Yeah, is that surprising?Toby asked.Ive been searching for a talking beaver for years, does he belong to you?Madam Jane asked Lisa.No, he owns himself, Lisa replied with a smile.Are you sure, I will buy him from you.Im sure, I dont own him.Have a seat, both of you, Madam Jane said excited.I have a proposition for you.she said to Lisa  What?Lisa replied.I will get you back to where you came from in exchange for the talking beaver.What do you mean where I came from?Sparksville, I can get you back there.How do you know about Sparksville?Lisa asked.Im psychic, did you read the sign on the door?Madam Jane asked.How can you get me back there?I have a doorway, a doorway that leads to where ever I point it.I can point it back to Sparksville and you can be home, all I ask is the talking beaver.Toby spoke up, Why are you talking like Im not here?Yeah, I dont own Toby, I cant give him to you, Lisa said.How badly do you want to go home?Madam Jane asked.Real bad, I have like ninety dollars, maybe more like eighty, can I buy my way back?No, I dont want your money, I need the talking beaver.Just out of curiosity, what do you plan to do with Toby if I could give him to you?I can cast a spell with the tail of a talking beaver, a spell so great it would make me invincible.Invincible to what?This isnt a Disney cartoon.Thats for me to know, Ive said too much as it is, Madam Jane said.Toby spoke up again, Beaver tail?Madam Jane ignored Toby and looked to Lisa.I can have you back home in minutes, all you have to do is give me your beaver!she shouted.Hes not mine to give!Lisa shouted back, Get your own talking beaver!Madam Jane stood up and slammed her hand on the table, You stupid girl, youll be trapped here forever!Lisa shook her head and looked at Toby.Lets get out of here, she said.Yeah, Toby said like he was in a fog.Lets get out before I lose my tail.Both Lisa and Toby stood up and turned to leave when they saw the front door shut on its own.They heard the click of the lock and knew they were fucked.Whats going on?Toby asked.That psychic bitch locked us in, Lisa said.We have to find a way out, Toby said.Try to break the glass with the chair.Lisa picked up the chair and began beating the door with it, nothing, it bent the chair but the door was undamaged.Then they heard Madam Jane from behind.Come with me, she said pointing behind the black curtains.Lisa was hesitant, but she knew she was trapped anyway, so she followed the psychic to the back.Toby followed but kept close to Lisa.Let me show you something, Madam Jane said.She walked to the back of the shop and pointed to a door that was closed.The room was dark and the walls were painted black, but the outline of the door was plainly visible.What?Lisa asked.Stay back, if you get too close, Ill lock the door and take your beaver and kill you.Madam Jane said.She stepped lightly towards the door and unlocked it.She opened the door slowly revealing the outside of the building, only instead of what they thought theyd see, they saw a familiar landmark of Sparksville, it was the city park with the Sparksville water tower in the distance.Now Lisa knew she could get home.See that?That is proof that I can get you home, thats Sparksville.Lisa looked out the door and immediately recognized the landscape, she didnt need the water tower to know that was home.All you have to do is give me your beaver and you can walk out that door and be home, Madam Jane said.What happens to Toby if I do?Lisa asked.I told you, I use his tail for a spell.What about the rest of him?What about it?Do you have to kill him to use his tail?Of course silly girl,  Why?You can take his tail without killing him, all you need is his tail!Lisa shouted.Madam Jane had to think about this, she always assumed shed have to kill a beaver if she found one, what beaver would give up its tail voluntarily?Maybe I can let the beaver live, if it gives up its tail.See, there is a compromise, Lisa said.Toby spoke up, Why do you two act like Im not here?Lisa looked down at Toby, Would you be willing to give up your tail so I can get home?You want me to let that nutjob chop off my tail?You trust her?Toby asked.Actually Toby, I dont know what to think anymore, I want to go home, I dont know anyone here and I dont want to live my life in Lancaster.Id rather not lose my tail, Toby said.Lisa let out of breath and looked out the door at Sparksville.She really wanted to go home.Ok, you can have the beaver, she said.What?Toby said.Im going home, I cant stay here any longer.Madam Jane spoke up, Can I get that in writing?Just take the fucking rat and let me go, Lisa said.Fine, have the beaver get in my cage before you go, Madam Jane said.No, I said you can have him, you put him in your cage, and Im done.Madam Jane shut the door and the room got much darker.Put the beaver in the cage, or no Sparksville, she said.Lisa walked over to the door and put her hand on the knob, Madam Jane didnt try to stop her.Lisa opened the door and what she saw was a set of stairs leading to a basement.No Sparksville.What are you?A witch?Yes, Madam Jane replied.Why cant you put Toby in the cage?I cant touch it before the spell or it will ruin everything.Then do your fucking spell now and get it over with, Lisa said.It takes preparations, I didn't expect you two to walk in the door today.Get a cleaver and chop his fucking tail off, it isnt that hard, stick it in a zip lock bag and put it in fridge.Use tongs if you dont want to touch it.Stop wasting my time and get me home.It doesnt work that way, Madam Jane said.Ill toss your ass down those stairs if you dont get me home, you got me?Lisa said pissed.Dont threaten me, Madam Jane said.I have a spell of protection upon me that keeps me from harm.Lisa grabbed Madam Jane by her robe and shoved her up against the door jam, she looked down at the steps and said, Lets test that spell, and shoved the psychic down the stairs into the dark below.You were going to let her cut off my tail?Toby asked.Im so pissed now I cant think straight, I had the chance to go home and now Im fucked.No youre not, Madam Jane said from the back of the room, I told you I had a spell that protected me.How did you get up the stairs so fast?Toby asked.I didnt go down the stairs, Madam Jane replied.Anyway, just cut off my fucking tail so she can go home!Madam Jane ignored Toby.Whats wrong?Im talking to you bitch!Yeah, why wont you talk to Toby?Lisa asked.Madam Jane didnt answer the question, instead she said, Put the beaver in the cage and you can go home, its that simple.How do I know youll let me go?Lisa asked.You dont, but what choice do you have?Who else is going to get you home?Lisa knew she was right, how else was she going to get home.Fine, she said and picked up Toby.Wheres the cage?Madam Jane made a motion with her hand and a cage appeared on the floor.Stick him in that, she said.And lock the door when hes inside.Lisa put Toby in the cage and the door behind her opened wide.It was Sparksville lighting up the room with a cool breeze blowing inside.She looked down at Toby, Im sorry, I have to go,  Toby looked up through the cage with a tear in his beaver eye, Just go, have a happy life, he said and Lisa ran out the door back to where she started from.Still naked, but happy.17   Adult diaper      Lisa ran through the door stark naked and was immediately picked up by the cops for indecent exposure and hauled to jail.Once booked, she was brought down to a holding cell where she met her mother and a woman she had never met before wearing an adult diaper cuffed to the wall.Mom, what are you doing here?Lisa asked.And why is she wearing a diaper?I have bad news honey, I shot your father and killed him, Anne replied.What the hell?Why?He was trying to pick up a male prostitute while I was in the car, Anne replied.Oh, so you found out?I suppose you knew all along?Anne asked.Yeah, since I was fourteen, I still remember the day I found out.Tell me about it, I want to know how I was so blind.Lisa hesitated, she felt like she had betrayed her mother for all these years and now had to confess, but looking in her eyes, she knew she had to tell her the truth.Alright, Im sorry I didnt tell you before, but I remember walking in on dad and the dishwasher guy fucking in your bed.Dishwasher guy?Anne asked thinking hard.Then she remembered, That was like eight years ago, when the wash cycle dial quit working.All I remember was walking in you room looking for something and seeing dad on top of this guy humping and making noises like he had asthma.It was really gross.I didnt make a sound and backed out and watched the rest through the crack between the door and the door jam.It grossed you out but you still watched?Anne asked.How couldnt I?Two grown men raping each other?It was sort of a turn on, I was going through puberty you know mom, I do have hormones.Why didnt you tell me?Anne asked.I didnt want you to know I watched dad butt rail the dishwasher guy, Id get in trouble.Did you ever see him do it again?Not to that guy, but while you were at work, hed have guys over in the garage all the time.He kept the door locked but I knew what he was doing.Who else knew?Trish, and all our friends, and most of the neighbors, Lisa replied.I dont know how Im supposed to feel about this, Anne said.Then Candye chimed in, Did he ever fuck you?Anne looked over at Candye and shook her head no.I just thought he didnt like sex.What man doesnt like sex?Candye asked.Did you ever consider he was having an affair with another woman?
