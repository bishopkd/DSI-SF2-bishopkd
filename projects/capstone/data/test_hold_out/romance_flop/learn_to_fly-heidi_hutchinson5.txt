No, it wasnt my name, it was a nickname and also a famous song.It really had nothing to do with me.Lennys expression was nonchalant and she waved it off.Cody pursed her lips before changing the subject.The seeds had been planted, the rest was their fault.Remember that time Duke got stuck in the tree?Cody asked Lenny whose eyes widened at the memory.Yes!I still cant believe he did that.She said, shaking her head.What happened?Harrison egged on.Okay, Duke, my crazy uncle who taught Lenny everything she knows, he prefers to find his own line.Whats a line?Sway was confused.The line is the track you take down the snow to get to the bottom.Lenny explained.Anyway, Cody continued.We had gotten way up in to the backwoods area that is seldom run and decided to be a little more risky with our chutes.Codys eyes sparkled with humor at the memory.The rule has always been: if you can see the bottom, follow Dukes line; if you cant see the bottom, do not follow Duke.Lenny started to giggle again but tried to keep it quiet so that Cody could finish telling the best part.Duke took this wild line down the hill and instead of following the open area where he could clearly see what was coming; he veered to the left and went over this small ridge.Well, he thought it was small.Cody paused to let Lenny laugh heartily, everyone's eyes were wide in anticipation.Turns out, it was this huge cliff that dropped into nothingness and he ended up in a tree.It was really fortunate that tree was there, Lenny pointed out.He couldve gotten really hurt, otherwise.Who?Duke?Cody rolled her eyes, That guy is invincible; hell out live us all.She turned to Lenny, You should really call him.Seriously, Lenny, Cody let out her aggravation.No one loves you more, not even your own parents.The least you could do is give him a call and tell him youre okay.Fine, Ill call him.Lenny conceded with frustration in her voice.Youre right, he deserves better.Cody put her arm around Lennys neck and hugged her close.Thank you.Itll be good for you, too, ya know.And now they all knew that Lenny abandoned those closest to her.Zing.They continued to visit for another hour and then Cody leaned over and kissed the top of Lennys head.I have to go, Bird.I have an early morning appointment.She stood up and Lenny joined her.Hey, call me if you need anything.Cody looked into Lennys face with a serious expression.Ill see you in Aspen.Cody paused.Or maybe at the Lodge if you decide to go home for Christmas.Lenny nodded but didnt speak.Cody left feeling satisfied with her visit.They were obviously still friends which meant that the memory lapse around the accident was still intact.Shane always worried for no reason.Now if Cody could just convince Lenny to come back to competing, maybe she could find out once and for all who was actually the best.The next few days all sort of blurred together for Luke.They had a show every night so they were pretty much on the bus nonstop.Anytime he and Lenny had a free moment they would make out like high schoolers.In the back of the bus, behind the bleachers, in the dark behind the venue.And every night, he would sing his song to her, hoping she would fall for him just a little bit more.The weirdness from Cody's visit had passed but it had taken a few days.Luke had noticed Lenny's distance but didn't confront it.He wouldn't even have known where to start.He and Mike had had a conversation that left Luke feeling leery of Cody and unsure of how to address it.How do you tell someone that their best friend is a poison in their life?Besides, he was having too much fun with Lenny to want to spoil it.The excitement of sneaking around was new for Luke.His past relationships had all been very public and nearly completely physical.Not this time.They talked about everything, all the time.The only one he had ever shared so much with was Mike.But Luke was still very aware of how gun shy Lenny had been even recently.He wasnt going to push for anything more than what they had right now.He liked her and she liked him.And the kissing was fantastic.Luke was making his way to sound check, his standard grin plastered on his face from having just spent the most amazing three minutes with Lenny in the back lounge of the bus.He jumped when Ashton stepped out in front of him.Shit!He said, startled, his smile gone.He stepped past her and continued on.Ashton looked annoyed at being blown off and ran to catch up to him.I need to talk to you, Luke.She tried to get his attention.No you dont, Ashton.Luke frowned straight ahead.Im sorry for what I did to Lenny and I want to make it up to you.Luke kept marching forward without pause.Ashtons voice was getting desperate as they neared the stage.I know that shes your friend and youre really mad at me but I want to make things better so we can go back to what we had.They had made it to the stage area and everyone was watching as Ashton nervously spit her words out.Her voice was getting shriller and she was starting to cause a scene.We need to fix this, baby!Youre just not your best self without me!Luke stopped in his tracks and turned his scowl on her.Im going to be as clear with you as possible, Ashton.His voice was low and gravelly.We, he pointed to her and himself.No longer exist.That ended a long time ago and never should've happened in the first place.We had a fight, Luke!Thats what couples do, but we can still make it work.No, Ashton!We are not a couple.Lukes voice was growing in volume.But, baby !You have to listen to me!I dont like you!Lukes voice was sharp.The arena went dead quiet and Luke felt all eyes on the commotion at center stage.Ashton wasnt giving up that easy.She tried to reach for Lukes hand but he stepped back, away from her.I know you still have feelings for me!Ashton shouted, she was forcing the issue.In the past, when Ashton wanted her way she threatened to make a public spectacle, knowing it made Luke uncomfortable and he would give in to get her to shut up.That song you sing for encore every night, I know that youre singing it to me!Ashton, you wanna know the truth?Okay, here it is.I never had feelings for you.Never.I was lonely and you were convenient.I feel bad about that, I really do, but Im a different person now.Youre the same person.Youre shallow, vapid and cruel.Youre mean to me and my friends and your own employees.The song I sing every night is for someone who is the exact opposite of you.Shes amazing and sweet and Im crazy in love with her.Ashtons mouth fell open.The guitar techs nodded their approval.Ashton reached for Luke again and again he pulled away and shook his head at her.She turned in a huff and left the stage.The onlookers broke in to applause.Lennys stomach felt like she had gone over a hill.Her head was a little foggy, maybe she misheard.Maybe Luke hadnt actually just announced that he loved her to the entire band and crew.She took a breath and focused on trying to stop her hands from shaking.Okay, she thought reasonably, he didnt actually say my name.No one else knows hes talking about me.That only offered a few seconds of comfort because the next thought was Luke just said he was in love with me.She decided to not overreact.She could handle this.Obviously, there was going to be a rational explanation and Luke would tell her later.She went about the rest of her night trying to behave as normally as possible.Ashtons set was a blur, Double Blind Study was outstanding.Luke took his seat during the encore and sang his song to Lenny, the one he had written for her.He sounded almost desperate, urgent.She couldnt tell because she wasnt looking at him.She wanted to, it was just that the lights seemed particularly bright from her seat.After the set finished, she headed back to the bus and turned on the TV, looking for anything to distract her and get her brain working properly again.Mike and Luke entered the bus, joking and laughing, acting like everything was normal.Lenny did her best to participate in the conversation.She knew they were talking to her but she wasn't paying attention to what they were saying.She was answering mechanically.After an hour or so, Mike excused himself to bed and Lenny and Luke were alone.He moved over to sit next to her on the couch and she stiffened.He gave her a gentle smile and reached over to hold her hand.She didnt pull away but she did flinch a little.Hey, Lukes voice was a soothing balm on Lennys frayed nerves.I only said that to get Ashton off my back.Lenny let out her breath like a deflated balloon.I know.She lied, still trying to appear fine.Luke chuckled, No you didnt, you were totally freaked out.She smiled then, Was it that obvious?Yes.Luke confirmed.But dont worry, Im not saying that yet.I dont know how I feel and   Neither do I.  Luke cut her off.Really, it was just to make a point to Ashton.His eyes were pleading with Lenny to believe him.She folded into his arms and he held her close.Weirdly, she felt better believing that he wasn't actually in love with her.She loved the feel of his strong embrace and smell of his aftershave as she leaned against him.The anxiety she had been feeling all night had completely disappeared in his arms.She didnt know what that meant, and she refused to try to define it or examine it.Luke and Lenny spent every spare moment together.They joked around with the familiarity of old friends and when no one else was around, they were kissing.Lenny started to go through Chap Stick a lot faster and it made her smile to know she had a secret reason for that.What she wasnt thinking about was all the things she was putting off.She used her secret fling with Luke as an excuse to not fulfill her promise to Cody to call Duke.She didnt want to have that conversation.They had wrapped up the last show on this leg of the tour and the bus got stuck in a snowstorm on its way back to Chicago.They had made it to a truck stop but the drivers announced that it would be too dangerous to continue, they would have to wait for the roads to clear.It was fortunate that it happened that way and they didnt have to cancel or postpone any shows.The band members gathered in the Blue Bus and were playing various games and having a few laughs.They toasted to a successful tour, they toasted to no one killing Ashton and they toasted to the promise of a successful overseas tour after the break.Are you coming with us?Blake asked Lenny in regards to the overseas tour starting at the end of January.I dont see why not.Lenny raised her eyebrows, Unless you dont want me around anymore?No, we voted last night.It was unanimous, you have to come with us.Harrison said from the back of the bus, joining them.Lenny nodded, knowingly.She smiled at the rag tag group of dudes who had become her family over the past couple of months.She couldnt picture not being with them.Are you going home for Christmas?Sway asked.I think I should, yeah.Lenny admitted.It was strange how things had changed so much for her and how different she felt.When this tour had started she had expected to end up in a different town with a different life.But now she was thinking that maybe she should salvage the life she already had.If she still could.What about you guys, where do you go for the holidays?Lenny asked.Well all head home to Boston.Mike explained, Its where our families live.He nodded fractionally at Luke who looked down and rubbed his brow line casually.Lenny knew so much more was said between them in that moment than she would ever understand.What must it be like to not have a family to go home to?But to have a friend so close that you know you belong in their family events without the verbal invitation?Lenny's heart hurt at the thought of Luke being alone for the holidays.And she suddenly felt very selfish for having avoided her own for so long.Except Blake, Sway interrupted her thoughts, pulling her back to the conversation.He goes home with Harrison.Lenny frowned, waiting for the explanation.I'm not from Boston.Blake glared at Sway.Can we still come with you to the X Games?Harrison asked suddenly, changing the subject.Of course, Lenny said, a little confused by the question.Wasnt that the plan?Harrison breathed a sigh of relief, I was afraid you were going to change your mind.You can get pretty elusive when it comes to you other life.Lenny chuckled, Thats true, I suppose.She thought about it for a minute and realized that the guys would be totally out of their element in Aspen.They were used to being the rock stars, she wondered how they would fair being regular civilians.It was true, they would be recognized and some people would probably ask for autographs but she knew that there was a whole other reason for the crowds.It could get weird for you guys, you know.She thought she might try to prepare them.Oh, we know.Mike grinned.The roles will have flipped: well be your assistants.Lenny felt a tinge of apprehension.It must have showed on her face because Luke rested his hand reassuringly on her thigh.She looked at him and his expression quieted her mind instantaneously.She loved how just looking at him had such a powerful effect on her.You guys gonna be okay during break, being separated and all?Sway addressed Lenny and Luke.The room laughed at their startled expressions.What do you mean?Luke tried to play it off and be cool.Seriously?Sway raised his eyebrows at where Lukes hand was resting familiarly on Lennys thigh.Yeah, its the worst kept secret around, guys.Blake prodded.Lenny blushed and looked down.I dont know what youre talking about.Luke obviously knew he was caught but kept trying to signal the guys to drop it.Were friends, what?Yeah, okay.Sway said sarcastically, deliberately ignoring Lukes attempt to deflect the truth.Luke looked to Mike for help but he shrugged.Its really okay, guys.Blake said.Weve known for a while.Known what for a while?Luke continued to play dumb.Lenny smiled at how he was trying and she knew it was only to make her comfortable.Yes, Lenny finally said.We are a little bit closer than just friends but were not labeling it right now.Frickin' hipsters, Blake snorted.Fine, Ill label it for you.Perfect for each other, there!Was that so frickin' hard?Lenny didnt know what to say after that.Luke smiled at his friends.Leave it to them to take something to a whole new level.He squeezed Lennys leg and chuckled low in his chest.How long have you guys known?Lenny asked them.Since Denver.Blake answered, surprising both Luke and Lenny.How?Lenny was perplexed; she thought they had been careful.Well, it was kind of obvious.I mean, Lenny had needed a good kiss for a while.Why do you think I was always asking to make out?Sway joked.Yeah, you were both suddenly very happy.Blake winked at Lenny.Lenny shook her head and smiled.She was afraid they wouldnt approve but that wasnt the case at all.Carl might be a different story.So, you guys gonna see each other before Aspen?Sway asked again.The reason Im asking is because it is gonna be weird not having you around for like, two weeks.Lenny shrugged, I guess we hadnt really talked about it.She looked at Luke who was beaming at her.I talked to Scott the other day and I decided to stay at the Lodge with Duke and see if I can talk him into joining us for dinner on Christmas Day.Have you even talked to him yet?Mike asked.Lenny clenched her jaw slightly.No.I was gonna surprise him.She tried to clear the emotion from her throat.Whats the deal with you guys anyway?Harrison asked.I mean, I get hes like your Miyagi and all but why the avoidance?It was a legitimate question.One that Lenny didnt really have a legitimate answer for.Duke had been more than just a mentor.He was the only one who had truly supported her in everything.They had a similar spirit and drive, hating the social norm and rebelling against the standard.She never had to explain things to him, he already knew.Even when she decided to be more conventional and pursued qualification in the Olympics, he supported her.But she knew he didnt agree.He thought her best lines were made in the back country, amidst the unpredictable elements.She felt like she had let him down more than anyone.She became too cocky, ignored her instincts and thats what really caused her to lose control out of the chute.How was she supposed to talk to him now?What could she say?I guess I just wouldnt know what to say.Lennys words sounded lame even to her.She looked at her hands in her lap and picked at a stray thread on her jeans.You want me to come with you?Lukes voice was so sincere and full of concern that it made Lenny feel even worse about her actions.No, I think it would better if I see Duke alone at first.Besides, if hes mad, I dont really want to get yelled at in front of you guys.She smiled, indicating she was half joking.You think hell yell at you?Blake questioned.Trust me, I deserve it.Lenny rolled her eyes, So much you dont know.An idea came to her then, Hey, you guys wanna come out for New Years?We can chill at the Lodge for a couple days and then all fly to Aspen together.They all exchanged glances, thinking similar thoughts.Lenny was so elusive about her past; she would never really talk about herself openly.Now suddenly, shes inviting them to her home in the backwoods of Wyoming for a major holiday.This was such a big step that they agreed without much thought.Lenny relaxed against Lukes side then, leaning her head onto his shoulder.Luke squeezed her leg again and smiled faintly.The guys resumed their video game session and Luke let his thoughts wander.He was concerned about Lenny but couldnt explain it.He knew there were issues she still wasnt dealing with and he wasnt sure if she trusted him enough to let him help her through it.Being on the road had its advantages of keeping them separated from real life and he knew how jarring a return to the norm could be.Especially for someone who was running away from their reality.He tried not to let his concern cloud his mind, but a fear was lurking he couldnt seem to shake completely.Cody: she's coming to Aspen      Shane: are you sure?Cody: yes, don't be a baby about it      Shane: don't be a jealous bitch, Cody      Cody: you're such a dick      Shane: at least I'm not fake       10    The Outsiders      Snow had started to fall as Lenny approached the Lodge.She was always amazed by its massive beauty, no matter how many times she had seen it.It was enormous, with a wooden and stone structure, perfectly nestled into the mountainside with an expansive view of the range from the back.She hadn't planned on coming up until tomorrow, but after dinner with her parents and a disconcerting conversation with her father about Duke's whereabouts, she had felt a rush to check on him sooner rather than later.She knew she was worrying unreasonably.He was a grown man and had no trouble taking care of himself.But, then again, most of their relationship had been fairly irrational.Lenny parked her old Bronco in the drive, not bothering with the garage door.She grabbed her duffel and started up the walkway.When she opened the front door, all the interior lights were off.Hello?She called into the darkness.She reached for the switch on the wall by the door, flicking it on.Hello?She called again, stomping the snow off her shoes and slipping them off before leaving the foyer.Duke?She called into the living room, but received no answer.She traveled through the empty area and into a smaller den off to the side.She flicked the light switch, but the room was empty.She backtracked and went through an adjacent door leading to the kitchen.The floor to ceiling windows faced the west, and the sun was beginning to set, giving the illusion that the stainless steel appliances were made of pure gold.But it was also void of human presence.Lenny touched his cellphone on the counter and picked up her pace across the granite floor and sprinted up the stairs leading to the bedroom area.She saw a light on in Dukes room at the end of the hall and she breathed a sigh of relief.He's here.She slowed to a walk, her socked feet silent on the wood floors as she came to the open doorway.Duke was sitting with his back against the headboard, reading a book.His thick, dark hair matched his full beard, making him look older than he really was.Lenny smiled at his red flannel pajamas, a mountain man to a fault.He was wearing reading glasses and his lips moved just noticeably with the words as he read.Lenny leaned her body against the door frame, watching quietly.A million different emotions began to toy with her heart and she felt its pace quicken the longer the silence continued.She hadn't been fair to him.Of all the people she had been trying to escape, Duke should have never been on that list.Its kinda early to get ready for bed, isnt it?She finally asked into the stillness.Duke didnt even look up.Nope.He continued reading.Lenny swallowed; she knew she deserved the cold shoulder.She slowly slid down the door frame and pressed her back against it, bringing her knees up to rest her arms on them.Im sorry I didnt call, Duke.She said trying to keep the tremble out of her voice.Duke turned the page in his book and kept reading.Lenny sighed and leaned her head back.I made up your bed for you.Duke broke the silence but still didnt look up.Lenny felt a smile start at the corners of her mouth and her heart started to make the long climb from the floor back to its proper place in her chest.How did you know I would be here?The wind told me.Lenny chuckled softly, Scott told you I was coming, didnt he?She shook her head as realization swept over her.You werent missing, you guys planned this.I have no idea what you are talking about.Duke kept his tone even and conversational.I was really worried about you, you know.Lenny tried to make him feel bad even though she knew he wouldnt.She didn't have a right to that anyway.Duke finally closed the book and put it down on the nightstand, giving Lenny his full attention.She shifted uncomfortably from her seat on the floor.Maybe this is where shed finally get lectured, she had it coming and she knew it.Did your mom send any of her chili with you?Lenny frowned, confused.What?How didno, what?Duke stood up and shuffled past her and down the hall.He turned to see if she was coming.She pushed herself to her feet and followed him down the stairs and into the kitchen.Duke opened the fridge and started to pull out ingredients for a sandwich.Here, let me do that.Lenny took the packages of lunch meat out of his hands and gently shoved him out of the way.Duke made a satisfied grunting noise and meandered over to one of the stools against the counter facing Lenny.As she sliced cheese and tomatoes, he watched her movements closely.Her hands were steady, theyd lost the tremble she had the last time he had seen her.She moved deftly around the kitchen, like she hadnt been away at all, remembering where each and every thing was kept.Her hair was loose and more than halfway down her back, very different from the tight braid she had insisted on after the wreck.Her cheeks were a healthy pink and she had put on some muscle, filling out the sunken places the accident had left her with two years ago.Duke rested his elbow on the counter and put his bearded chin in his palm, rubbing his whiskers above his lips.Six months, thats how long it had been since he had last spoken with Lenny.Six months ago she ran off with rock stars and scared him nearly half to death.And now she was suddenly back, making him a sandwich in the kitchen in the home they had shared for five odd years.How long you staying this time?He asked gruffly.He noticed she winced just a bit but she looked up at him and met his eyes.Through the New Yearthen I have to go to Aspenthen on to Europe for the end of the tour.She placed the perfectly structured sandwich in front of him.What happens after Europe?Duke sunk his teeth into the thick, wheat bread.It was perfection.He hadnt had a sandwich this good in a long time.Im not really sure She came around the counter and sat on the stool next to him.He swiveled slightly so he was angled toward her.Duke chewed thoughtfully for a few minutes.When do I get to meet the guy?He tried not to smile at Lennys surprised expression.What?Lenny blushed and she tried to fight the dopey grin that wanted to commandeer her face.What guy?What are you talking about?Cmon, Lenny, dont bullshit with me.How did you know there was a guy?She narrowed her eyes at Duke.Don't insult my intelligence.Of course there's a guy.No other reason why youd have that dumb grin on your face.How are you not mad at me?Lenny frowned at him, perplexed.I was mad at first.But I got over it.Duke finished his sandwich and rubbed the crumbs out of his whiskers.Dont change the subject, which one was it?The drummer?The guitarist?He studied her coy expression.Nahyoure too flashy for that, you went for the lead singer, didnt ya?Lennys eyes widened and she smacked his shoulder.Flashy?Duke chuckled, I knew it.She shook her head, her hair falling over her face, hiding her expression.Were still working out the kinks, its all very new.Whats his name?Luke Casey.Lenny couldn't hide the grin as she said it and Duke chuckled.Geez, you got it bad.Duke shook his head in mock disappointment.Is he coming for New Year's?How do you already know everything?Lenny exclaimed.Seriously, are you spying on me?Duke chuckled again, I told you, I know you better than anyone.He looked out the big windows and watched the sun slip completely behind the mountain line.Well, I hope hes better than the last guy you brought home.Shane was nice.Lenny chastised seriously.He was an idiot.All caught up in the technical.Duke let out a tiny belch.You just didnt like his style.Lenny quietly defended.What style?The guy was afraid to even try fresh pow.Besides, who has more style than me?Duke raised his eyebrows and pointed to his red flannel pajamas.Lenny laughed, You're right, no one compares to you.Damn straight.Duke gave a satisfied grunt.He watched her as she gazed out across the last few flashes of orange sunlight shooting through the clouds.He willed her to soak in the calm climate of the the home they had created together.Could it be the refuge that they had planned so long ago?Could she finally feel safe again?Her face had lost its pinch, her eyes were soft in the low light and she wasn't nearly as jumpy as she had been a few months prior.Duke felt a combination of elation and heaviness settle over him.She was better, but still not whole.Well, Duke stood up and scratched his belly.Im going to bed, I have a five am alarm set to get out there.Youre not coming to the house for Christmas?Lenny asked.Nah, youre the only gift I need.He reached over and messed up her hair.She pushed his hand away and pulled her head back, laughing.A full, hearty laugh, like when she was a kid.Duke moved toward the stairs but turned around before ascending them.Im glad youre back.Even if it is only for a little while.He said sincerely, wanting to say more but finding the timing all wrong.Lenny smiled faintly, I am too.After Duke went to bed, Lenny went into the foyer and grabbed her duffel and headed upstairs to her third floor bedroom.When she had first purchased the Lodge years ago it had come fully furnished, which had been a major appeal to her since she really didn't have the patience or eye for interior decorating.Her mother, on the other hand, had taken it upon herself to completely gut the furnishings and start fresh.She had said that Lenny's home should be a reflection of Lenny herself.Lenny had agreed mostly because she really didn't care, and also, she wasn't sure she'd be able to talk her mother out of it.What had transpired that summer still amazed Lenny to this day.She was ever thankful that she had let her mother have free reign over the decorating process.Kelli Evans had simplified everything.Creating the perfect, comforting atmosphere that made Lenny feel at home despite the massive size of the estate.Every room was modest yet elegant, a symbol of Lenny's riding style.But out of all the rooms in the house, her bedroom was her favorite.The entire third floor was a master suite.Floor to ceiling windows covered the westward facing wall with a majestic view of the Tetons.A King size bed with heavy, down comforters that had always kept Lenny warm despite the subzero temperatures of a Wyoming winter was centered against the east wall.Her walk in closet could have been another bedroom in and of itself and it was adjacent to her equal sized bathroom which boasted a shower and full size bath tub.The walls were adorned with original paintings done by her grandmother when she had been a younger woman.Lenny slung her duffel into the purple armchair facing the small gas fireplace and sighed.She didn't need to turn on any lights in the main room as she changed for bed due to the brilliance of the full moon coming through her windowed wall.She was looking forward to sleeping in her own bed again, and actually sleeping.The stress dreams and muscle aches had stayed largely absent since...well, since that first kiss.Lenny touched her lips absentmindedly and smiled.Luke Casey's kisses had a powerful effect indeed.She snuggled under the heavy covers and checked her cellphone.One new text.She bit her lower lip as she opened the message.Luke: I miss you already.It's crazy since I just saw you a few hours ago.I hope this week goes fast.Merry Christmas, Lenny.She tapped out her reply and placed the phone on the nightstand.Pulling the covers up to her chin she smiled into the starlit bedroom.Homecoming had never felt so sweet.Duke slept restlessly.He tossed and turned most of the night before he finally got up way too early and made himself some breakfast.He watched the mountains wake up in the chilled sunshine and contemplated changing his morning plans.He would be thirty six next month and it was Christmas after all.Maybe it was time to do more 'grownup' things.He washed his breakfast dishes and started a pot of coffee.Now that Bird was home he was going to have to get back in the habit of making extra again.He rubbed his hand down the front of his face and tugged on his beard.Except she wouldn't be staying for long.Maybe he should go with her to Christmas dinner at her folks' house.He shook his head in silent disagreement.He didn't think he could get along with Scott for that long of a time frame.And she should really be with her family for the holiday.He hadn't ever fit into that mix.No, he would spend the day with his first and only true loves.The mountain and the board.His mistress and his passion.He jogged up the stairs lightly, being careful not to disturb the other house guest.He needed to get changed and get out of there as soon as possible.If Lenny asked him to change his plans, he would.He struggled with telling her 'no. 'That girl always managed to turn his world upside down.Lenny closed the door to the cold world outside and looked up the open staircase of the home she had grown up in.Mom had the place completely decked out in holiday festooning.Lights, ornaments, wreathes and ribbons hung from every doorway, railing and light fixture.The air was thick with cinnamon and opulence.Lenny took off her scarf and hung it on the hook, she slipped her jacket off and placed it in the closet.Auntie!Lenny was suddenly accosted by four little boys, all under the age of eight.They surrounded her and hugged her while she struggled to stay upright.She finally gave in and collapsed on the floor, laughing.Boys!Their mother, Felicity, clapped at them from the top of the stairs.Let your auntie up.Lenny hugged each one individually and they ran off into another part of the house.Felicity had made her way down the steps and embraced her.She started to guide her towards the kitchen,  Sorry, about that.Felicity chuckled, They've been pretty excited to see you.Not a problem, Lenny smiled widely.She inhaled the delicious aroma of turkey as she entered her mother's state of the art kitchen.Lenny, you're early!Her mother exclaimed from behind a a stack of pies.Did Duke come with you?Um, no.He said last night that he wanted to get out there early and I heard him take the sled when I woke up.I never see that man when there's snow cover.Kelli muttered more to herself than anyone else.Geez, ma, you think you got enough pies?Lenny teased her tiny mother.Kelli Evans was only five feet tall but made up for her lack of height with extra spunk.Lenny had gotten her father's tallness but otherwise could have been a carbon copy of her mother, same blonde hair, same dark blue eyes.I hope so.Kelli answered seriously, eyeballing the tower of pies arranged on a tiered pie stand.We ran out last year, you know.It was awful, your father cried.Lenny snickered at her mom and made her way to the stove top to get herself some apple cider.Len, dinner won't be ready for a while yet, do you think you and Nathan can take those little boys outside and burn off some energy?I would love nothing more.Lenny smiled and drained her cider.She went in search of Nathan to challenge him to a snow fort building competition.They each claimed two of the little boys for their team.In a matter of minutes they were all suited up and out in the cold.While the four rambunctious boys started to build their piles of snowballs in their finished forts for the eminent fight, Nathan and Lenny had a little heart to heart.Im really glad you could make it home for Christmas.He looked at the house.I wasnt freaked that you took off, I totally understood.They have always set the bar a little higher for you than the rest of us.Lenny nodded, Yeah, I shouldve done it differently but I am glad I got away for a while.It really helped to put some things in perspective.You ever think youll go back out there?Nathan nodded to the mountains in the distance.I dont know.Lenny answered honestly.I heard you have a boyfriend.His eyes twinkled, teasing her.Lenny rolled her eyes at him.Its still pretty new.I dont know what Id call it.She knew she would have to deflect any discussion of Luke all day.She wasnt sure what to say.Well, hes coming up for New Years, right?Yeah, but the whole band is coming.All of them.So its not like a special thing.Lenny could see that Nathan wasnt buying it.I dont know, Nate.She said, exasperated.I like him and he likes me.Thats all I have figured out right now, okay?Okay, but I may have to question the young man on his intentions with my sister.Lenny hit his coat with her mittened hand.Stop it!You will not!Nathan was laughing, delighted that he'd gotten her so riled up.Oh, now I have to.He was dodging more smacks from her.Pretty soon Lenny picked up a snowball and hurled it square in Nathans face.Snowball fight!One of the little boys yelled and it was instantly a free for all.The air was filled with volleying balls of snow and excited yells.Lenny and Nathan were ducking and trying to ward off the sudden onslaught.It was the adults against the kids, they were completely outnumbered.They clamored into the mud room off the back of the house, Lenny instructing the little boys to take off all their wet clothes before going through grandmas kitchen.They happily obeyed, satisfied that they had won the snowball fight against their aunt and uncle.I dont know how you do it, Fe.Lenny said to her sister in law as she got herself another cup of hot cider off the stove.Felicity laughed, Neither do I!Lenny leaned her back against the warm stove and breathed in the amazing scents in the kitchen.You ladies sure have been cooking up a storm in here.It smells so good!Thanks, Lenna!Would you mind checking the table to see if Scott needs anything?Her mom asked as she scurried down from a step stool with an enormous turkey baster held like a weapon as she headed for the oven.Lenny nodded and walked onto the dining room.Mom, wants to know if you need anything else.She addressed Scott who was pushing the kids table into the corner.No, I think I have it all.Kay.She sipped her cider, studying her tall, older brother.Where is Simone?She asked about Scotts longtime girlfriend who was always at every holiday.The photographer he had met in New York a few years ago was tall and willowy with vibrant red hair and a smattering of freckles.She was noticeably absent this year and no one had mentioned her.In fact, Lenny hadn't spoken to her since the night before her interview with Carl.We decided to take a break.Scott didnt look up from his task.What does that mean?Scott straightened up and put his hands on his hips.She wants something Im not ready for yet.We decided to take a break and see how we feel after the holidays.Thats stupid.Lenny couldnt stop herself from declaring her view point.Thats your opinion.Whatever.Shes too good for you anyway, I cant believe you wont just marry her already.Its been what, five years of dating?Scott frowned at his sisters reprimand.Thats interesting, coming from you.Whats that supposed to mean?Lenny could feel her neck heating up.Youve had one boyfriend your whole life and now this thing with the rock star that we all know wont last, and you think you should give relationship advice?Lenny knew he had a point but it irritated her.I liked Simone, thats all.Scott grunted and went upstairs to get more chairs.Lenny took her cup back to the kitchen and checked to see if they needed her help.They were fine and sent her out to the den to see her father and other brother, David.Lenny curled her legs under her and sat on the big leather sofa in front of the fire while her father and David played chess.What Scott had said about Luke bugged her.He didnt know if it would last.How could he?It was still brand new.Lenny wasnt even sure where it was going.Maybe that was the problem.She leaned her head against the arm rest and stared into the fire.She thought about the guys and the road and how exciting going to Europe would be.She also thought about Duke and the Lodge and the whole life she had waiting for her here, whenever she decided to rejoin it.Was there even the possibility of a future with Luke?Wouldnt he just move on to the next girl when the tour was over?Yes, more than likely, thats what made the most sense.She could just enjoy what little time they had left.New Year's would be fun.And Europe would be great too.But Lenny decided that after Europe she would come home to the Lodge.She may never snowboard again but she could be close to see her nephews grow and be around if her parents needed her.It was time to make grownup decisions.You okay, kiddo?Her father broke into her thoughts.You look like you're thinking about something pretty hard.Lenny twisted her head so her chin was on the armrest and she was looking at her dad.Yeah, just thinking about New Year's.Your mom and I are leaving for the Caymans tomorrow, you need us to stay?No, I think Nathan and I have it pretty much handled.Lenny gave him a small smile.How is Duke?David asked, making a move on the chess board that caused her father to grunt.He's the same.Lenny replied.Duke really was the same.Nothing with him ever changed.She smiled to herself as she thought of him.Christmas Day and he was out on a run.This was the first one in a long time where she wasn't sharing it with him and wishing she was.Duke slowly peeled off his sweater, being careful to not tug on his left shoulder.He rotated that arm a few times, trying to loosen the tightness that had built up.You tweak your shoulder again?Lenny's voice startled him.He hadn't seen her sitting at the bar when he'd come in the backdoor.Aren't you supposed to be in town?He ignored her question, continuing to strip out of his wet clothes without grimacing from the pain running through his arm.Ma sent home some leftovers.And an entire pie.Lenny wasn't being fooled.He saw her watching him closely and irritation shot down his spine.The last thing he needed was for her to be worried about him.Can I help you with that?She jumped off the stool and started towards him.I got it.Duke didn't mean to snap but that's what had happened.Lenny wasn't even fazed.She rolled her eyes and smacked his hand out of the way as she grabbed the bottom of his shirt and tugged it over his head.Duke didn't have the coordination to fight back even though he knew what would happen next and he wasn't disappointed.As Lenny dropped his shirt into the pile on the floor, she gasped.Oh, stop.Duke growled.He tried to push past her with the intent of going to his room and closing the door.But Lenny wasn't having it.Holy crap, Duke.Her eyes were wide as they took in the bruises that adorned his torso.It must have been worse than he had expected by the shocked look on her face.What the hell happened out there today?I took a spill.His mouth crooked up on the side, Maybe a few.Well, Lenny scrutinized his wounds and he had to fight off the self conscience feeling washing over him from her careful gaze.You look terrible.But, she turned him around and gingerly touched some of the marks, feeling for cracked ribs, I don't think anything is broken.She gently rubbed his sore shoulder and gauged his reaction.I don't like that you keep messing this up, you might need to see a doctor one of these days.She raised her eyebrows at him and her sweet concern made is heart melt.I'll be fine.Duke reassured her.It's not like I've never wrecked before.He grinned as he hobbled towards the stairs, this time she let him pass.How about I put some clothes on and you heat me up some of that food you were talking about.He didn't turn around to see if she would comply, he knew she'd do it.In his room, Duke surveyed his body in the mirror.Yep, I do look terrible.He slipped his arms in a loose button up flannel, only bothering with half the buttons.His skin still burned from where her fingers had touched him and he silently scolded his anatomy for letting her affect him like that.He put on some baggy pajama pants and stood before the mirror again.He gave himself a stern look and let out all the air in his lungs.Get it together, dumb ass.He took a few more minutes to clear his head before he made his way back to the kitchen.Lenny had an impressive spread set out for him on the bar; turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing, gravy, biscuits and green beans.She was sitting on the counter top across from the bar, her legs dangling.I thought you said there would be pie.Duke grumbled as he took his seat.You can have pie if you finish all of that.Lenny laughed and Duke relished that sound that had been missing for way too long.And he knew the credit belonged to someone else.Not that he hadn't tried, they'd all tried to snap her out of her funk after the wreck but no one could reach her.Now, she seemed closer than she'd been in ages.How was the family?He asked between forkfuls.Good, everyone's happy and healthy.Scott?Duke looked up in time to see her scrunch her nose.The usual.Duke nodded knowingly.Scott was always harder on Lenny than Duke felt she deserved.One of the many reasons he couldn't get along with that guy.What's the plan for New Year's?Nathan will move up here tomorrow to help me set up.He has mom's gift for decorating.She smiled at him crookedly.I'd really like it if you were here for it.I really want you to meet all the guys.I'll be around.Duke nodded as he took a drink of water.He knew what she was really asking.She wanted his approval of the new guy.He had never approved of Shane and he suspected that was one of the reason's she had stopped talking to him about the important stuff.Now that things with Shane were over, Duke was back in Lenny's confidence...for the most part.Lenny went through her closet and packed what she would need for Aspen and then packed a separate suitcase for Europe.She was glad she would be able to bring some fresh clothes for the second leg of the tour.No hasty packing this time around.Duke had been out on the mountain daily since she'd come home.Every night before he went to bed he asked Lenny if she wanted to come with him in the morning.She always said no.She wasn't ready for that.She might not ever be.She busied herself preparing for her guests.The upstairs had several single bedrooms and one large room with six bunks in it.She made sure all the sheets were clean and all the bathrooms were fully stocked.It was weirdly similar to her job on the road.Every night, she and Duke would sit by the fire and visit.She didn't get personal and neither did he.But it was soothing and Lenny enjoyed the knowledge that no matter how far away she went or how long she was gone, she would be able to come home to Duke's solid presence.His loyalty never wavered.11    Tensioning      Duke stared into the fire, just a simple conversation, he thought.It shouldn't be that hard.You guys used to talk all the time.He didn't look up as Lenny entered the room and handed him a mug of homemade hot chocolate.One more thing he was going to have to miss in a week.She'd only been home for a few days and she had easily settled into their old routines; cooking all his favorite winter comfort foods, cleaning up his wet clothes after a day's run, going into town for gas for the sled.She wouldn't go out on any runs with him, but he never stopped asking.He knew there was still so much more to say, to talk about.Too many things were getting ignored and he wasn't even sure where to start.When does their plane get in tomorrow?Duke asked instead.That was another thing that he was trying hard to come to terms with.The guy who had set her world right again was going to be in his, er, her home the very next night.He had no idea how far this little relationship had gone, but he wasn't going to be cool with them sharing the same room.Around noon I think.A lazy smile played on Lenny's lips.Nathan is gonna pick them up when he goes to get his brothers.It's still weird that Nathan was part of a fraternity.Duke shook his head.No, what's weird is that they still show up at my house every New Year's Eve.But it's really Nathan's party.We both know you wouldn't throw a party...ever.Duke smiled as he sipped his hot chocolate.Very true.Lenny agreed.Duke let the silence become comfortable again.They had talked a lot the past few days.Lenny had shared nearly every detail of being with the band.Duke was positive he'd be able to identify them by name on sight.She had obviously made lasting friendships with these guys.He understood why she was going to at least finish the tour.But he hoped she wasn't using that as an excuse to walk away from snowboarding permanently.That was what he needed to ask her...now, where were the right words?Is this our last night alone for a while?He kept his gaze focused on the flames but he felt her shift a little on the couch.Just for a little while...I'm coming home after Europe.Duke didn't reveal his surprise at her answer.He took another slow slip of hot chocolate before asking his next question.What about Luke?He didn't want to know, but he had to just the same.I don't know, Duke.She let out a deep breath.I like him and stuff but he's a rock star.And, I guess, I just don't see a future there.She stretched her legs toward him and reclined against the armrest.I miss being here, with you.This is nice, right?Nice?This is my personal heaven.Yeah, it's nice.Duke knew she was staring at him so he finally turned to meet her eyes.She gave him a small smile and he deepened his frown.You ever gonna go back out there?Her smile faded and she looked away.I don't know.Her voice just above a whisper, I'm scared.Duke narrowed his eyes, Of what, Lenny?He matched her tone, not wanting to make her jumpy.Her eyes lost focus as she stared into the fire and Duke knew the answer lay there, in her perfect memory.But she wasn't telling him tonight.Lenny watched as Nathan hung the giant silver and gold wreath in the main foyer.He really loved decorating way too much for a mixed martial arts professional.Does that look centered to you?He asked, leaning back on the ladder trying to get a better vantage point.Yes, it's perfect, stop obsessing.Lenny chuckled and crossed her arms over her chest.The whole place looks perfect, you've outdone yourself this year.Nathan grinned at her and she swore he was seventeen again instead of his actual age of thirty five.His blue eyes shone brightly as he hopped off the ladder and surveyed his latest achievement.I am pretty awesome, aren't I?He stood proudly with his fists on his hips, a happy smile spread on his face.This party is my favorite every year and this one is probably my best yet.Why did you decide to pull out all the stops this year?Lenny picked up a box of extra decorations, handing it to Nathan and then picking up another one for herself.He followed her through the house and towards the garage.I don't know, last big hurrah I guess.Lenny spun suddenly, nearly colliding with Nathan as she stopped short.What?This is the last one?Nathan chuckled, I guess you haven't heard then?Lenny shook her head, waiting for his explanation.I completed my coaches certification a few months ago and to make a very long story short, the USOC has tapped me to be assistant coach for Team USA.I'm going to be busy for a while.Like, years.Oh my gosh, Nathan!Lenny set her box down hastily and threw her arms around her big brother's neck.I'm so proud of you!Congratulations!Nathan shifted the his own box to one arm and hugged her back, his smile stretching from ear to ear.Thanks, Len.I'm pretty excited about it.I've always loved coaching and the Olympics is the ultimate for me.Lenny picked up her box again and they resumed their trek through the house to deposit them in the garage.She asked him questions as they popped into her head, truly looking forward to her brother's new future.As they entered the garage and Lenny turned the lights on she froze in her place by the door.She had gotten distracted by her excitement for Nathan that she had momentarily forgotten her earlier trepidation at entering this specific part of the Lodge.Nathan stood next to her and let out a low whistle, That is a lot of equipment.All along the back wall of the the oversized garage was a huge assortment of snowboards.It looked like a display from at an athletic gear store.Every size, shape and color imaginable adorned the entire length of the wall.Duke had expertly hung the shelving and track lighting in order to make it look like an art exhibition.A huge cabinet with a glass front showcased her various helmets, goggles and boots.Lenny swallowed twice before setting down her box.It was an odd feeling, like walking into a funeral of someone you used to know well but just didn't anymore.You okay?Lenny snapped her eyes to Nathan, his face was filled with concern.Her throat was dry and she swallowed again before she answered.I'm fine.Her voice was clipped and and she knew he didn't believe her but she didn't want to have this conversation.Lenny, Nathan had already set his box down and he took a hesitant step towards her, let's talk about it.Lenny stiffened.There's nothing to talk about.I'm fine.We have a party to get ready for.She spun on her heel and left the garage with Nathan hot on her trail.There's no way you're okay, you're very clearly not okay.He wasn't exactly shouting but his voice was louder than Lenny thought necessary.She ignored him and rounded the corner leading down a long hallway that would take her to the dining room.She had a lot to get done before the caterer arrived.Lenny, please!Nathan grabbed her elbow from behind and she yanked it away.I'm your brother, please talk to me about it.Hot tears started to burn the back of Lenny's eyes and she grit her teeth in frustration.She came into the dining room and ran full on into Duke.He grabbed her by her forearms to keep her from falling but he didn't miss the agitated look on her face.She turned away and tried to move past him.What's going on?Duke asked, not letting go and directing his question more at Nathan than Lenny.She won't talk to me.Nathan's frustration was obvious.About what?Duke's deep frown looked down into Lenny's eyes and she silently begged him to not pursue this.The same thing she always hides from...snowboarding.Nathan ran his hand through his short hair and let out an exasperated growl.Just forget it.I have to get to the airport.He paused and took a deep breath.I'm sorry, I hope this doesn't ruin your night.He exchanged a look with Duke and left them alone.Duke's frown stayed put and Lenny felt her heart rate returning to normal.You okay?He asked, letting go of her arms finally.Yeah.Lenny gave a him a small smile and cleared her throat.Um, can you put the ladder in the foyer away?I'm going to go take a shower.Duke nodded but he didn't say anything.Lenny headed to her room, relieved that Duke had been there.Always backing her play.The music had started pulsing long before the party started.Nathan hired a DJ every year and they had moved the furniture in the ginormous living room to make way for a dance floor.Lenny wondered if Nathan was back yet.If Luke was there.She had spent considerable extra time getting ready.She hadn't seen Luke in a while and she wanted to look...pretty.She curled her hair in loose waves that hung down her back and lined her eyes with charcoal, giving a slight smoky effect.She considered wearing a party dress but settled on skinny jeans and a dark purple top that showed off her shoulders.Nathan's New Year's Eve parties were unique in that they were amazing and alcohol free.He wasn't taking any kind of an ethical stand.They were a family of athletes, and winter was the height of training, it just never combined well.When Duke moved in, an alcohol free environment became the rule since he was a recovering alcoholic.It was one of the reason's Lenny had been so impressed with the band's support of Mike's sobriety.It was an obvious indication of loyalty and devotion.But the lack of alcohol never made the party dull by any means.Nathan's frat brothers usually had a pool tournament, snowmobile races in the back and of course dancing.Lenny took a deep breath and looked at herself in the mirror one last time.Cody rubbed her temples with her fingertips while Clara prattled on and on about something she had absolutely no interest in whatsoever.Where did she find these people?Oh yeah, they were her friends.The limo bumped along the snowy road and Cody knew they were getting closer to their destination.She took a slim bottle out of her purse and drained the remaining contents.She knew Lenny's little soiree would be dry and she was going to need to be decently lubricated if she planned on being a good guest.What is that?Erin asked, her wide brown eyes watching Cody swallow the remaining liquid in a flourish.Fun in a bottle.Cody winked, Want some?She produced a second bottle and uncapped it, handing it to Erin.Erin took a swallow and sputtered; she passed it to Clara sitting next to her who also took a swallow.I thought there was no drinking at this party.Clara downed more than she needed and Cody was delighted.This might be more fun than she had originally anticipated.That's why we have to do it now.She answered and took the bottle back, pouring more down her throat and then shoving the bottle back into Erin's hands.She raised her eyebrows in silent expectation and Erin caved.She tipped the bottle back and took several gulps.Cody pursed her lips, this was most definitely going to be fun.Lenny hugged Cody in greeting, shocked that she had shown up at all.They hadn't spoken since Denver and she hadn't intended to invite her.Cody had brought her usual entourage of girls in skimpy party dresses but it was the overwhelming smell of vodka that rolled off of the group that made Lenny recoil.Have you been drinking?Lenny asked in Cody's ear.The response was loud laughter followed by Cody heading for the dance floor.Lenny shook her head disgustedly, going back to the kitchen to check on the caterers.That girl was walking a line that Lenny never understood.She wanted to throw her out but she also didn't want to end the party just as it was starting.She found Duke who had actually dressed up a little, for Duke anyway.He was wearing his nicest flannel and hed trimmed his beard.He looked at Lenny with a twinkle in his gray eyes and stole another little sandwich off of a tray that a young lady was feverishly trying to fill.Im glad you decided to come off the mountain and join us.Lenny smiled and got a bottle of water out of the fridge.Well, someone has to keep an eye on the food.He winked at the little attendant again as she moved the tray out of his reach.You should come mingle, Cody is here.She brought her usual entourage.How bout Nate the Great?Yeah, his old frat brothers are here, makes for a weird mix.Lenny laughed at the absurdity.Codys friends were all in their early twentys whereas Nathans friends were a good ten years older and had careers.Just then, someone came up behind Lenny and touched her elbow.She turned to see Lukes smiling face.A thousand different frequencies of joy washed over her.She impulsively put her arms around him, hugging him close.Hey, you.She greeted warmly.Luke held her a little tighter and a little longer than would normally be socially acceptable.He breathed in her familiar scent and made a rumbling noise in the back of his throat that could only be described as pure contentment.He had missed her.The man Lenny had been talking to cleared his throat from behind her and Luke released his embrace.He looked into steel grey eyes and stuck out his hand.Hi, Im Luke Casey.Duke.The man replied with a firm handshake.The way Lenny and Cody had spoken of him, he had expected an old man.Instead, he found himself face to face with someone maybe only five years or so older than himself.His athletic build was evident despite his thick flannel shirt and Luke found himself standing a little straighter.This was the guy Lenny had been living with for the past week?Duke, this is the lead singer for Double Blind Study.Lenny introduced and Luke struggled with his sudden desire to put his arm around her possessively.Right, the circus you left town with.Duke nodded.Luke squinted slightly, trying to decipher the undertones in which Duke spoke.Mike, Sway, Harrison and Blake descended upon Lenny at that moment, crowding the kitchen and making it even harder for the caterers to maneuver.Blake picked Lenny up and gave her a bear hug.She squealed in surprise and slapped his shoulder so he would put her down.She hugged the rest of the guys, happy to see them, then introduced them to Duke as well.Handshakes happened all around, manly grunting and stiff greetings.Lenny must have noticed the subtle tenseness that lingered and tried to break it up.Lets get out of the kitchen so these people can do their jobs.She led them out to the open living room where the dancing was in full combustion.Luke saw Cody at the center of the mess and he wasn't surprised.Some girls spotted the rockers and pulled most of them onto the dance floor.Luke hung back, wanting a few minutes alone with Lenny if it was available.It had been far too long since he had kissed her perfect lips.He slipped his arm around her waist resting his hand high on her hip, having brief eye contact with Duke but acting as casual as possible.Maybe Duke picked up on Luke's not so subtle hint, maybe he was just hungry but he suddenly announced he needed more sandwiches and left Luke and Lenny alone together.Lenny watched the band members dancing with Cody's friends and she scrunched up her nose.Maybe this was a bad idea.Youre not on duty, theyre gonna be fine.Luke lightly laughed at her reaction.A thin girl with short, caramel colored hair was laughing too loudly and Luke suspected she had been drinking before her arrival.She staggered off the dance floor and came towards Lenny.Do you know where some water is?I'm so thirsty.Then she burst into giggles again.Lenny pulled the girl towards the kitchen stopping just in the doorway.She ducked inside and came back quickly, handing the girl a bottle of water.As the girl thirstily sucked the water down, Luke saw Lenny's face become unreadable.How do you know Cody?Lenny asked the girl tightly.I'm Erin, I met her through my boyfriend, well, I guess hes not really my boyfriend, I dont know what we are.Erin giggled again and a hiccup escaped.Where is he tonight?Lenny tried to sound casual but she was getting the weirdest sensation in the pit of her stomach.He said he shouldnt come because it would be too hard to see his ex and he thought she might be here.Erin rambled nervously and looked around the room like she was expecting the girl to pop out and scare her.It took him a long time to get over her, I guess she really broke his heart.Thats too bad.Luke said tenderly and Lenny shot a frown his way but he missed it.New Years Eve is always such a special night, Im sorry he couldnt be here with you.Erin nodded emphatically, I dont know who the ex is but I guess she totally obliterated him.Weve had to work through a lot of issues involving trust and honesty and stuff.Erin noticed Lennys eyes narrow and she stammered.Im sorry, I'm talking too much.She giggled nervously.No, its fine.Lenny forced a smile and put her hand on Erins arm.Just keep in mind, theres always two sides to every story.Sounds like the ex is a real bitch.Luke interjected and Lenny felt her mouth fall open as she looked at him.Cody shimmied her way over to them and threw an overly friendly arm around Luke's waist.Hey, whatcha talkin' bout?Her face was flushed from the excessive alcohol in her system as well as the dancing.Erin was just telling us about the guy shes seeing Luke began not moving from away from Cody's side.Yeah, Shane.Cody nodded, Bet you guys could compare notes.She laughed as she winked at Lenny who only returned a slow subtle shake of her head.But it was too late.Even though Erin's faculties had been reduced due to her drinking, she wasn't completely brain dead.She turned towards Lenny, eyes wild.Wait, youre the ex?Erins giggling was replaced by a a more heated expression.Shane who?Luke frowned, not following along.Shane Brookings, my boyfriend!Erin pointed at herself and took a step away from Lenny like she was afraid of her suddenly.You told me that wasnt serious.Luke's voice was dark and he looked at the floor.It...wasnt.Lenny looked from Luke to Cody to Erin.How was this happening?Her eyes settled on Cody who had the slightest of smirks on her face, arm firmly in place around Luke's waist.Yeah, for you!Erin exclaimed.Im the one who had to try and to pick up the pieces after you left him six months ago!Six months?You made it sound like you had been broken up for a lot longer than that.Lukes frown was deepening and he started to back away from them, pushing Cody's arm off of him.Ill talk to you in a minute.Lenny said to Luke and then she turned to Erin.She needed to get this back under control.Too many things were unraveling at the same time and she wasn't prepared.Please, try to understand that there is a lot more to the story than what you know.I never meant to hurt Shane.I suppose you had this guy just waiting around for you.Erin pointed at Luke.You were probably seeing both of them at the same time.Lenny looked at Cody who was watching everything unfold with a look of sadistic glee smeared across her face.I need some air.Luke said brusquely and stalked off.Lenny wanted to follow him but she needed to end this nightmare first.She turned back to Erin who was almost in tears.Erin, Im sorry for whatever hurt Ive caused you by breaking up with Shane.I never cheated on him and if he has trust issues thats not my fault.Lenny's words were forced and clipped but she was too angry about what was happening to care.Whatever, Im going home.Erin grabbed one of the girls off the dance floor and began to cry until the girl agreed to find her a ride home.Lenny glared at Cody.Wow, was that planned or what?I forgot she was seeing Shane  Cody started to lie but Lenny cut her off.Bullshit, Cody!Thats how you met, she already told me.Lenny rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest.I put up with a lot of your shit because of Duke but I've about reached my limit.Don't get mad at me because Shane moved on.Cody's face grew venomous.This isn't about Shane!Lenny was starting to shake.This is about you being a horrible friend!Excuse me?Cody raised her eyebrows aggressively.You were the one who skipped town the day of one of the biggest meetings of my life!I needed your backing to land that sponsorship and you didn't even call!I'm sorry, I didn't know it was up to me to secure your future for you!Lenny replied sarcastically.Maybe you should have been a decent human being instead of alienating everyone around you.You're such a spoiled little bitch!You have always had every little thing handed to you and what wasn't given to you, you had no problem taking!Cody's lips twisted savagely and Lenny stepped into a defensive stance.Cody had been drinking and Lenny knew that if she attacked it would be sudden and sloppy.Ladies, how about we take a breather.Nathan inserted himself into the confrontation.He nodded at one of his frat bros who came over and took Cody's elbow, leading her away.Lenny didn't break eye contact with her until they had rounded the corner.What was that all about?Nathan asked when they were finally alone.Cody brought Shane's new girlfriend to the party.Did you know that he's telling people I cheated on him?Lenny felt her eyebrows go up when Nathan nodded.You don't believe it, do you?How did I end up the villain in this?No, I don't believe that you cheated on him.But he was really hurt by your leaving and I think he's just handling it badly.This is unbelievable.Lenny's face was hot and she wished she could go outside for a break from this...insanity.Nathan took a breath and continued.You have to remember the facts.You and Shane dated for over two years.He got your name tattooed on his arm, he moved to Wyoming to be closer to you, and I have it on pretty good authority that he was getting ready to propose to you before you dumped himin a text message.Geez, Nate.You make me sound like a monster.Lenny was really growing tired of how people assumed they knew what had happened between her and Shane.Im not trying to.I just think you need to realize someday that your actions have consequences.Just because you werent invested in the relationship didnt mean he wasnt.You kind of treated him like crap and he was a really great guy.A really great guy?What the frick ever.What are you saying?Lenny was trying hard to bite her tongue.Nathan had no idea what he was talking about.Nathan let out a heavy sigh.If you weren't in love with him I don't understand why you waited two years to end it.And I have to wonder about the new guy.Lenny shot him a glare and Nathan swallowed hard.If youre not in love, dont lead him on.End it soon and be gentle.Luke found himself on the back patio, without a coat in the cold mountain air.Someone approached him from behind and handed him a heavy jacket.Luke slipped it on and turned to thank the individual.It was Duke.Perfect.Duke nodded at him and gestured to a set of chairs off to the side of the patio.Luke followed him and sat down, not sure what to expect from this conversation.A lot had happened so far tonight and he hadn't processed any of it.So far, all he had gathered was, Lenny had a much more serious relationship with Shane than she had led him to believe.Oh, and she was living with a very attractive man who stank of testosterone in the backwoods of Wyoming.Saw that little display in there, Duke started.Luke grunted and looked up at the stars.If you wanna be with Lenny youre in for one hell of a ride.Duke chuckled to himself.She probably spent too much time on the mountain, never learned all the girl stuff.Her mom was always after her to hang out with people her age doing regular teenage things like, go to the mall.
