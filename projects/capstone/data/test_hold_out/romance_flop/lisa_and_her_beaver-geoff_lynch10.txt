Please call him Toby, Amparo sounds funny, Lisa asked.Fine, Toby turned you in, and we have video evidence to back his claim, as well as blood and fingerprint evidence.Say what you want, Toby didnt say shit, Lisa said.Hes not your friend, when the shit hits the fan, its everyone for themselves and he made a deal with the district attorney in exchange for his testimony.Alright, humor me, what did he say I did?He said you and him broke into Madame Janes apartment, threatened to kill her if she didnt remove your tail.She refused, you attacked her with a kitchen knife and in the struggle, you stabbed her in the chest and she managed to toss you out the second story window.She succumbed to her injuries and died at the scene twenty minutes later, Dombrowsky said.Sorry, never happened, Lisa said.We can show you the video of you entering the residence and of you falling out the window.Do you want to see it?No, I think this interview is over, Lisa said.We have a few more questions for you, Smith chimed in.What part of You have the right to remain silent dont you understand?Lisa asked.Toby also said that you planned the murder in advance, is that true?Dombrowsky asked.Even if that were true, what difference does that make?The difference between life in prison and lethal injection, Smith replied.Like I said, I have no memory of anything.If I did, I wouldnt tell you anyway, what do you think I am?Stupid?You did leave a lot of evidence at the scene, it was the work of an amateur.Im not saying you're stupid, but a pair of gloves might have helped.See, you answered your own question, if I had indeed committed this crime, and I planned it out in advance, I would have brought gloves, the fact that there are no gloves shows there was no planning.Is that a confession?Dombrowsky asked.No, Im playing your stupid game.Punching holes in your ridiculous theory.If I fell from the second story window, where are my injuries?Detective Dombrowsky lifted a page from her notebook and pulled out a scan of an x ray and placed it on the table.This is your X ray taken that night, you have three fractured ribs.Lisa leaned over and took a look at the X ray, her name was on it as well as the name of the hospital.She could clearly see the fractures in the ribs.This is a fake, Lisa said.I thought you might say that, Dombrowsky replied.People like you will never believe anything.No amount of evidence will ever convince you.We have Amparos statement, and more than enough physical evidence to convict, is there anything else youd like to say before we conclude the interview?Yeah, piss off, Lisa replied.38   Trial      Call your first witness, the judge said.The prosecution calls Toby Amparo to the stand, the prosecutor stated.Toby heard his name and scampered up to the witness box.The bailiff swore him in and the prosecutor approached.Mr.Amparo, may you state your species for the record?the prosecutor asked.You can call me Toby, nobody calls me Amparo, not even my parole officer.Im a beaver, Toby replied.How long have you known the defendant?Oh, six, eight weeks now?Toby replied.How would you describe your relationship with the defendant?We never had sex if thats what youre getting at, oh, no, actually we did once in a shower.So you were romantically involved?Lovers per se?the prosecutor asked.No, more like fuck buddies, Toby replied.Lisa stewed in her chair knowing full and well that Toby was lying and that they were not fuck buddies.So you didnt have a dating relationship with her.Are you asking me or telling me?Toby asked.Asking.No, we didnt date, not my type, way too bitchy if you ask me.In you time with her, did you notice a proclivity towards violence?the prosecutor asked.Oh fuck yeah, this is one hot headed bitch, I had to walk on eggshells around her or get my ass reamed.Did I tell you about the time she gave me to Madame Jane?Oh, she left me behind, knowing full well that cunt was going to cut off my tail and make stew out of me.She allowed Madame Jane to kill you?But you are still alive?Long story, but Im back, and that bitch over there let me die!Toby yelled.The bailiff stepped in close in case he had to restrain Toby.Did you ever hear Miss Marie threaten to kill Madame Jane?Yes, the night she murdered her, she said she wished she was dead, she said nobody puts a tail on her.Toby replied.Did you go to her apartment with the intent of killing her?I didnt, she did, Toby said looking at Lisa.Did you bring any weapons with you?No, Lisa didnt have any pockets, she planned on using a kitchen knife.She told you this?We discussed it over supper, Toby replied.She used her steak knife to demonstrate how she was going to stab that bitch, her words not mine, and make her pay.Did you try to stop her?the prosecutor asked.I was scared for my life, she had turned into a psycho bitch from hell and I thought shes cut me up next if I didnt do what she said.So you were an unwitting pawn in her evil scheme?Yes, unwitting is a good choice of word, Toby replied.No more questions your honor, the prosecutor said.The judge spoke up, Defense, your witness, and picked his nose.The defense lawyer stood up and walked over to Toby shaking his head in disbelief.Do you expect these fine jurors to believe that crock of shit you just spooned them?Thats sort of a loaded question dont you think asshole?Toby replied.Is it true, Mr.Amparo that you are indeed a rat?It is true that I am a member of the rodent family, but no, Im not a rat, Im a beaver.Isnt that just splitting hairs?Beaver, rat, same thing.No, not the same thing you douche bag, Toby replied.Do you have a question or are you going to call me names all day?The defense addressed the court, Your honor, may I have permission to treat this witness as hostile.Why?You just called him a rat, I think he has the right to defend himself, the judge replied.But your honor, this thing, this rotten stinking flea infested animal, is going to lie, its in its nature.The judge replied, My wifes uncle is a squirrel, technically a rodent and has been a fine upstanding citizen all his life.He has his own dental practice and has never had even a speeding ticket.I find your gross overgeneralizations appalling.I hope you didnt take my comments wrong your honor, I consider squirrels to be cute, fun loving creatures that populate our parks and make our lives better, the defense said kissing ass.Nice save, now get on with something of substance or let this witness go, the judge said.The defense scratched his chin and thought for a second.He turned to Toby and asked, Is it not true, that you are in fact, the ring leader and it was your idea to murder Madame Jane because she had killed you once before?I was pissed, Ill grant you that, but no, it wasnt my idea to kill her, that stupid bitch and her narcissism, couldn't hack having a tail, something that Ive had all my life and wanted to get petty revenge.I got my life back, I am fine, I may not like that bitch for making stew out of me, but I got my life back, Lisa didnt  She could have had the tail removed, why kill her?the defense asked.I dont know what goes on in her mind, everyone makes choices, Toby replied.Once again I ask, why should she kill her?The prosecution stood and said, Objection, the witness cant speak for the defendant.Sustained, the judge said.Next question.The defense walked back to his table and looked at his notes.He turned and asked, You say you feared for your life, why not run to the police?Toby took a second to answer.The police dont take kindly to rodents, Toby replied.I didnt think theyd do anything.I see, then why didnt you just leave?What do you mean?Walk away, youre not married to her, you claim you were just fuck buddies.You could have left at any time.Does this woman have some sort of strange powers over you?Stop trying to pin this on me, shes the one with the fingerprints on the knife, not me, Toby said.Whats to say you didnt plant those prints?the defense asked.Thats a stretch, Toby replied.There is a seven minute gap on the video from when you entered the building to when she fell from the second story window.You had plenty of time to plant evidence.I had no idea we were being taped, Toby said.Thats irrelevant, you still had plenty of time to frame my client and then shove her out the window.You think Im strong enough to pick her up and shove her out the window?She weighs like a hundred and fifty pounds.Im a foot and a half tall and weigh forty pounds, Toby said.Let me ask you this, what do beavers do?the defense asked.Eat and make little beavers?Toby replied.What else?I like to play my banjo.What are beavers known for?The sixties space program?No!Building dams!the defense yelled.Yeah, I suppose, Toby replied.Beavers cut down trees and make dams out of them, I would think it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say that an animal capable of moving a tree could move a woman.Using that logic I would have to agree, Toby said.Good, now why dont you do the court a favor and confess right now so we can get this circus over?I confess I moved a few trees in my day, that is, Toby said.The defense shook his head in disgust and went back to his notes.I have nothing else for this witness, the defense said and Toby took his regular seat.The judge spoke up again, Prosecution, call your next witness.The prosecution calls Officer Dustin Ramos to the stand, the prosecutor said.The court was silent as the uniformed officer took his place in the witness box.Officer Ramos, what was your duty the night of the murder?I was on patrol, Ramos replied.What did you observe when you came to the crime scene?I saw a woman lying on the sidewalk, and then when I went upstairs I saw Madame Jane sitting in a chair bleeding from a chest wound.Was she still alive?Yes, but she was acting strange, like she was in shock or something.Was there a lot of blood?Oh yeah, the chair, the carpet, covered in blood, Ramos replied.Did she say anything to you?Yeah, she told me to take the knife out.Did you?No, it was already out, the rat had it.Thats all she said?Well, she did say something else, but I didnt understand what it was, it sounded like she was asking for tail.Tail?Usually when someone wants tail, they mean they want to get laid.I dont think she wanted to get laid then.But Im sure she was grumbling something about getting tail, or more tail, I cant remember.Then what happened?the prosecution asked.She rolled her head to the side and croaked, Ramos replied.Where was the beaver when this was going on?He was playing with the knife, Ramos replied.What?Playing with the knife?Yeah, when I got there, he was walking in the room with a knife in his hand.Walking from where?The staircase leading to the street, Ramos replied.Did you think it odd that the beaver would have the murder weapon in his hand?Oh sure, I asked him where he got it.And what did he say?He said it fell out the window and he wanted to get it for me.How often does that happen?the prosecutor asked.In my career?Never, Ramos replied.Did you think for a second that the beaver was down on the street planting fingerprint evidence on the murder weapon?No, didnt cross my mind, Ramos replied.How long have you been a cop?Eighteen months, Ramos replied.Did they teach you anything about crime scene evidence handling at the academy?Yeah, why?Did I do something wrong?Ramos asked.I would like to call for a recess you honor, the prosecutor stated.On what grounds?the judge asked.I think Im getting sick, the prosecutor replied realizing he might have just sunk his own case with his line of questioning.Now he had to find a way to dig himself back out of the hole.But maybe it was too late, things werent looking too good for Toby.It would be a matter of time before the jury had the case and a decision was handed down.39   Preacher      Toby sat in a cell on death row.With what amounted to as a confession on the witness stand, the judge threw out the case against Lisa and Toby was put on trial.He was quickly found guilty of the first degree murder of Madame Jane.Today was his execution day and he was meeting with a preacher.How are you feeling today?the preacher asked.I feel like shit, what kind of question was that?Toby snapped back.Sorry, just trying to make conversation.Have you made peace with your maker?Ive died before, Im not worried, Toby replied.I heard about that, you were made into stew and then reborn into the body of a killer?Yep, thanks for the recap, what do you want?Im here in case you need comfort the preacher said.Comfort is two Asian hookers giving me a massage with benefits?I could possible arrange the message if youd like.No way, Ive heard of a last meal, but never a last blow job, Toby said.I could do that for you if you like, the preacher said.Ive had training.Toby gagged and wretched.No thanks, youre not my type.Just trying to help, the preacher replied.So now what?Toby asked.Are you going to feed me some bull from your bible?No, Im here to make you feel safe on your journey, in case you need someone to talk too.Well, I do have about three hours, what do you want to talk about?Toby asked.This is about you my son, not me, what do you want to talk about?Toby thought hard for a moment.How do they get girls to do that cheap ass porn stuff?he asked.What?the preacher asked.Yeah, you can go to these internet porn sites and see these girls banging themselves on a couch or doing lesbian shit, how do they get them to do that?I would assume they pay them?the preacher asked.Yeah I know that, but how do they find these girls?At the grocery store?Toby asked.Youre asking the wrong person, the preacher said.I dont look at porn.Bullshit, everyone looks at porn, hell my grandma looks at porn, Toby said.And she lives in the woods.Id rather not discuss this, the preacher said.You want me to be comfortable, then Im talking porn.Well, I dont have much to say about that.Dont you like sex?Toby asked.Yes, I do have two children.Dont tell me youve had sex twice.Of course not, me and my wife have a normal married sex life, the preacher said.Is she hot?My wife?Yeah, what does she look like?Toby asked.Shes an average looking woman, the preacher replied.Does she have big tits?Toby asked.Average I would say.How about her ass?Toby asked.Im not discussing my wifes ass with you.Oh, I see, must be pretty fat, Toby said.My wife isnt skinny, but shes not fat either, the preacher said.Does she shave?Toby asked.She shaves her legs, yes, the preacher replied.No, I mean her snatch, does she have a bald pussy?No, she is natural down there.So you get pubes in your teeth?Toby asked.What are you implying?You dont go down on her?Toby asked.Absolutely not, that is disgusting, the preacher replied.You were willing to go down on me ten minutes ago, must not be that disgusting.Its part of my comfort cares, I having training on how to do that, the preacher said.They teach you how to give blow jobs in preacher school?Toby asked.Yes, but its not like what you think, we dont think of it as sexual, we think of it as comforting.Thats fucked up.They dont teach you to comfort women?Toby asked.No, not like that, most women dont desire sex like men, women can be comforted emotionally.So, back to your wife, does she take it in the ass?I would never do that, you cant make babies that way.You only have sex to make babies?How dull is that?Toby asked.Dont try to make it sound like I have sex all the time, we only do it twice a month.Maybe you only have sex twice a month, but I bet shes getting it on the side.Why do you say that?the preacher asked.Women are far hornier than you give them credit for.I bet she gets laid three times a week, does she work?Yes.Where?She works here at the prison, in the office, the preacher replied.How often do you see her?I spend most of my time at the church, I see her when she gets home.Does she ever get frisky?No.Do you?Yes, on the days we have scheduled for sex.How does she act on those days?She does what a good wife is supposed to do.She undresses, lies on her back and spreads her legs.Thats it?Toby asked.Yes, whats wrong with that?How do you get hard?This discussion is over!the preacher stated.Now do you want a blow job or not?Not, now have you ever found anything that would lead you to think your wife was getting it on the side?Toby asked.The preacher was silent.Yep, I knew it, what did you find?Letters?A dildo under her mattress?Sex marks?She got pregnant!There you go, are you happy?the preacher yelled.Oh shit, didnt mean to piss you off.Six times!the preacher yelled again.Six fucking times!Then she had me pay for her abortions!Now calm down, I dont want you going all nuts on me, Toby said.The preacher leaned back and rested his head on the wall.He closed his eyes and made a fist.I want to kill that cunt so bad I can taste it.Tell me what it was like to kill Madame Jane, Ill never know the sweet joy of ending a life.I think about choking her out and cutting her up almost every day, tell me how that feels?Feels awesome, try it sometime, Toby said.No, describe it to me, I need more than awesome.the preacher said.I stuck her with a knife, it felt great, Toby said.I got the bitch back for making me into soup.I got my sweet revenge.The girl, why did you toss her out the window?the preacher asked.I didnt, Madame Jane did trying to defend herself.She thought Lisa was going to come after her when I pulled the knife.Once Lisa was on the ground, I stabbed the cunt in the chest.It was such a rush!Toby said.I envy you so much, the preacher said.I wish I had the balls to do that.Do it, whats the worst they can do?Kill you?Toby said with a smile.If I get you out, would you do it for me?the preacher asked.Get me out?Im on death row, Toby said.I have ways, since Im in the ministry, I have access to people and places no one else does.What do I get out of it?I get a needle in the arm either way, Toby said.You get the satisfaction that you helped another man in need.So you get off free?I dont think Ill get much satisfaction killing a woman I dont even know.Fine, youll be dead in three hours anyway, the preacher said and stood up.He called for the guard and waited to be escorted out.May God have mercy on your soul, the preacher said and he left Toby to himself to stew.Three hours later Toby was hauled out of his cell by prison guards to be taken to the electric chair, although the chair had been outlawed, there was no veterinarian available to do the lethal injection so an alternative method needed to be found so they dusted off the old chair and hooked it up again.Toby took the long walk down the dark and foreboding hallway to the execution gallery.His footsteps echoed off the walls and his shadow cast a hard reflection on the floor.Hows it feel knowing youre about to die?one of the guards asked.Well, from my experience, Id say it sucks, Toby replied.Yeah, I heard about that, youre the amazing retro rabbit.Im not a rabbit dumb ass, Im a beaver, and I have no idea what you mean by retro?I know, but it sounded good, the guard replied.Once in the chamber, Toby was strapped down to the chair and a metal cap was placed on his head.A prison official stepped in and announced to the spectators, We are here to witness the execution of Toby Amparo, convicted of the murder of Madame Jane.It is with the full authority of the court and this state that we conduct this execution, by law, on this date.Is there any last words the condemned would like to say at this time?Toby shuffled in his seat and thought for a moment, then he said, You know what I cant stand?And I dont know if its just me, but when they put a show on television about rich people, stupid people watch it like they were diabetics eating candy.I mean, who wants to watch someone driving a better car than you?Or living in a better house?People are so stupid, it takes very little to entertain them and they will take whatever you spoon feed them.And whats up with all this celebrity worship?Who gives a flying fuck what these people do on their off time?They take shits just like the rest of us, they all do the same shit, just because they got a lucky break doesnt make them special.Maybe its a good thing Im leaving this Earth, just to get away from the stupid people who will go to theme park on a Saturday so they can wait in line an hour to go on a ride.To get away from people who buy t shirts and coffee mugs with pseudo celebrities faces printed on them.To get away from people who post what they watch on television on Facebook.What fucking retards.Are we mining coal, and polluting our skies with carbon just so you can post your favorite meme on your Facebook page?Is that sort of technology even needed?How did our ancestors survive without a fucking smartphone?Do I need to know that your sister had an abortion or that your cat likes to lick its balls on YouTube?Oh fucking God!Kill me now!Are you done?the state official asked.Toby nodded dripping with sweat.Then the phone rang and the state official picked it up, he nodded a few times and hung it back up.I just received word from the governor, Toby Amparo has been given a full pardon in the murder of Madame Jane.Seems she has not been deemed a former enemy of the state and Mr.Amparo is a hero.You can release him now, you are a free beaver.40   Pool man      Two days later Toby showed up at the house he was supposed to be working at, he didnt know if he still had the job cleaning the yard and the pool, but what else was he going to do?Although he was granted a pardon, he was still felt like a felon and didnt think he could land a better job.Toby rang the doorbell and Lisa answered, she was wearing her uniform, stockings, garter, heels and a head band that looked like something a French maid would wear.Toby spoke first.Hi, how you doing?Lisa was still pissed, You threw me under the buss asshole!You called me a narcissist!I had my reasons, Toby said.Yeah, to save your own ass.You are a narcissist, didnt you want to be a porn model originally?Isnt that what got you into this mess in the first place?Lisa didnt have a comeback for that so she changed the subject.What do you want?she asked.I was wondering if I could have my old job back.Youll have to speak with Henry or Theresa and they are busy right now.Busy doing what?Is Henry butt fucking the butler?No, they are out shopping for new carpet, Lisa replied.Toby looked at the yard and saw that it was recently mowed.Whos been doing the yard work?They have a guy named Maximo that comes in once a week.Maximo?Sounds like the guy from Gladiator, Toby said.Is he Greek?I dont know, all I know is walks around without a shirt on half the time, has five percent body fat, has a ripped body and makes me cream every time I see him.I can feel my ovaries pulse whenever hes near, its like sex radar.Sounds like Im out of a job, Toby said.No, Henry hates him, cant wait to get rid of him.Why?Wont Maximo let Henry ass fuck him?Exactly, he tried a few times and it pissed Henry off, these people are loaded and are used to getting what they want.Does that mean that if I want my job back I have to let Henry butt rape me?No, Henry isnt into bestiality, youre safe, Lisa replied.Do you know when theyll be back?Id say in an hour or so, you want to come in and wait?Sure, you have any diet soda?Henry asked.No, they dont drink soda, just cherry punch and wine coolers, Lisa replied.They still make wine coolers?Toby asked stepping into the house.What is it again they have you do around here?Toby asked.I dust, wipe off tables, sometimes make their bed if theyre not around, mostly I sit around and watch television, Lisa replied.Why do they need you?Eye candy, Im here to make Theresa happy, rub up against her, and flirt with her, stuff like that.I thought you were fucking her?Toby asked.Not anymore, she had a leg removed due to her diabetes and now shes in a wheelchair.The best she can do now is play with my tits now and then.Sounds like an awesome job to me, Toby said.No, it sucks, Im bored all fucking day.Its like Im working in a nursing home.Then apply for a different job, Toby said.I cant, theyre charging me rent now so I dont have enough money to move out, and its there way of trapping me here.Then a van pulled up to the front, it was Henry and Theresa back from carpet shopping.I have to help them, Lisa said.They have a hard time running the lift.Lisa walked as fast as she could down the steps to the van parked on the street.She opened the back doors and pressed a button that allowed a metal lift to carry Theresa and her wheelchair to the street.Toby scurried up next to her.Theresa took notice and said, Hey, its Toby, the hero of Lancaster, you came back!with a smile.Toby didnt know how to react.Uh, thanks, he said.You hear for your old job back?Sure, if I can, Toby replied.Theresa was now clear of the lift and was using her electric wheelchair to speed up the driveway to the ramp that led to a new door they had installed.Toby kept up pace.When can you start?Theresa asked.I can start today, Toby replied.Good, Henry will be glad, now we can get rid of that Greek.I want you to get started on the pool right away, its a disaster, I think its getting a green tint to it, disgusting.Right away Maam, Toby said and scampered off to the back yard where he found something he never thought hed find.A man lying by the edge of the pool, on his back, looking like he was ready to die.Toby ran to the man and began cpr, it didnt take long for the man to come around and gain consciousness.The man sat up and looked around, he seemed dazed and confused, but managed to ask, Wheres Lisa?To Tobys shock, this man knew Lisa and for some reason, looked vaguely familiar.Then he put two and two together, this was the man Lisa was with when he found her hiding in the Subway shop in Sparksville.This is the guy who shot him in the face.At first anger overcame Toby, then it quickly subsided, He was a monster when that occurred, influenced by the man he overcame.He was part murderer and part Toby, but now he was back to who he was, he couldnt hold a grudge anymore.Whats your name?Toby asked.Judd, my name is Judd, where is Lisa?Just then Toby heard Lisa yell and turned to see her running in her heels over to the man sitting up next to him.Judd was still dripping wet, and smelled like the river.Judd!How did you get here?Lisa asked.I went back to the farm where they abducted us, I asked around and this beaver told me she saw you dive in the river near a narrow part and disappeared.I dove in to see if I could find your body and ended up here?Beaver?What beaver?Toby asked.She didnt give me her name, but she did have these big loop earrings and wore some really dark blue eye shadow.Thats my mom, Toby said.Oh, she was real nice, she offered me some twigs and bark.Yeah, shes like that, one of those typical corny moms, but I love her, Toby said.Anyway, I jumped in the river and got sucked into this tube and ended up in that pool.Yeah, Lisa said.I made that trip like two or three times.Youre no longer in Sparksville, this is Lancaster.Lancaster?Never heard of it, but I had to know what happened to you after that killer abducted you from Subway, whatever happened to him?Judd asked.Hes sitting next to you, Lisa replied.Judd looked at Toby and back to Lisa.No, that guy was like six and two hundred pounds.Its a long story, but Toby is the guy who took me, hes not the same guy he used to be so dont worry.Hes all about being a nice beaver now.Toby spoke up, Yeah, Im sorry about all that, I wasnt myself.Oh, no problem, sorry about shooting you in the face then, Judd replied.Look, its all healed up.Lisa took Judd by the arm and helped him stand.Lets get you to the house and cleaned up, she said.She took him by the arm and escorted Judd to the back door and sat him down under the awning on a patio chair.She ran into the house and grabbed a towel from the bathroom and brought it back out and handed it to Judd.Thanks, Judd said.You said you made that trip two or three times?How do you get back to Sparksville?he asked.Toby spoke up, You have to find a witch and give her a talking beaver to kill, its complicated but trust me, it works.So I can get back eventually?Judd asked.Maybe, we got lucky, or should I say I got lucky, Toby kind of got screwed, but if there was a way then, there must be more ways, Lisa said.But it will take some looking.In the meantime, we need to get you a place to stay.Where are you staying?Judd asked.I live here and work here, so does Toby, Lisa replied.Do you think theyd let me stay until I figured out how to get back home?How far away is Sparksville from here?Lancaster and Sparksville dont exist in the same dimension, they are only connected by that tube, I think it may be a wormhole, Lisa said.So I may never get home?Maybe not, unless you have a pair of red ruby shoes you can click your heels with, Lisa said trying to lessen the tension.What if I cant get home?My family, my friends.I dont know what to say, you just got here, youll find a way, Lisa said.Now defeated, Judd laid his head back in his chair and closed his eyes.Now what the fuck have I got myself into?he asked.Hey, I met a photographer down at the mall, he might need help, and how does that sound?Lisa asked.How is that going to get me back to my family?Judd asked.It wont, Im trying to get your mind off this for a while.Now remember that model shoot you and I were going to do?I think we should do it, just like you promised.In case you didnt notice, I didnt bring my camera with me, I rarely swim with it, Judd said sardonically.I can get you a different camera, dont worry about that.I want to be a famous porn model, and you are the man thats going to make me famous, isnt that exciting?Lisa asked.Yeah, and we can get abducted again and I can be forced to jerk off into a cup again.Stop being such an ass, Im trying to help you!Lisa snapped back.These people you work for, are they normal?Judd asked.Lisa hesitated, Normal enough, she replied.Explain, Judd said.Then Toby spoke up.The wife is a lesbian diabetic that likes to molest the help and the husband has been butt fucking the butler for over thirty five years.Is that why you dress like that?Judd asked.Yeah, Theresa likes the way I look, she pays me to be her eye candy.At least youre not jerking off into a cup, Judd said.You will like them, Ill see if you can use the spare room until you can get on your feet, Lisa said.You might want to go to the sex shop down at the mall and buy a butt plug in case the husband cant find the butler.Never know when a little protection might come in handy, Lisa said.Toby spoke up, If you need a butt plug, I can chew one out of a branch for free if you dont mind splinters.No thanks, I dont need splinters in my asshole, Judd replied.But thanks for offering.Do you want something to drink?Lisa asked.Sure, Judd said.Whatever you got is fine, I need to get this river water taste out of my mouth.Alright, Lisa said and opened the patio door to the kitchen to get some cherry punch.What she saw when she opened the door horrified her and she let out a scream that could be heard throughout the entire house.Please!Dont kill me!She yelled and slipped on the bloody floor onto her ass.41   Revenge      What Lisa saw was Henry naked, bending over the kitchen counter with the butler standing behind him with full anal penetration.The butler was holding a knife sticking in Henrys back, and Henry didnt look happy about it.Help!Lisa yelled and Toby and Judd ran in the kitchen.Oh my fucking God!Toby yelled.The butlers got a knife!The butler pulled the knife from Henrys back and stabbed him three more times.When satisfied, he let Henry slide off the counter and fall to the floor.There, standing naked and bloody, the butler laughed and said, Its about time, that pervert deserved everything he got.But you were butt fucking him, not the other way around, Toby said.He made me do that, I detested every second of his sick perversions, for thirty seven years, I either took it in the ass or put mine in his, now Im free.Why didnt you quit years ago?Toby asked.I couldnt, he blackmailed me.Years ago he caught me fucking his wife, and he said he would tell my wife if I didnt let him have his way with me.My wife died on Monday, he cant hold it over me any longer.Youve waited thirty seven years for your revenge?Toby asked.All while working with the woman you fucked?How did your wife not know?My wife is none of your business, shes dead now, and so is he.Now what?Toby asked.Now I kill the bitch, she was in on it too, they paid me fifty dollars a week for thirty seven years, never a raise, never a vacation, and never any sick time.I had to work the day of my daughters birth and the day of her funeral.I am going to stick this knife into that bitchs neck and watch her bleed out onto the floor.Then Im going to stomp on her body like one of those kids bounce houses.I am finally getting what I deserve!Then a voice from the opposite side of the room, Not so fast mister!Theresa yelled, she was in the doorway, in her wheelchair holding a fireplace poker.What are you going to do with that?the butler said with a grin.Im going to fuck you up butler boy!Theresa yelled.The butler stepped over to the wheelchair and ripped the poker out of Thereses hand.He raised it up and smacked her one remaining leg with enough force to tear open her slacks.There you stupid cunt, take that!the butler said.What are you?Batman?Who talks like that?Theresa asked.No, Im not Batman, why do you have to be such a bitch all the time?Ive put up with your shit so long Im ready to explode!Why I ever fucked you thirty seven years ago is beyond me, but then you werent so fat and pathetic back then.Yeah, well you dont look so great yourself jackass, Theresa replied.What are you?Twelve?Ive had more grown up conversations with a baboon, the butler said.You are a baboon, a baboons ass.Youve been ass fucked so many times you shit every time you walk.I know, I see your little shits all over the floor all day.I have to use a doggy pooper scooper just to keep up with you.That wasnt me that was Henry, Ive worn an adult diaper for ten years now.Ive been ass reamed so many times by your husband my hemorrhoids are impacted in my colon.I dont want to hear about your medical issues, Theresa said.I have enough of my own.The butler kicked Theresa in her stump and laughed.You know that diabetic food I was supposed to be making for you?I never made any of it, I actually doubled the sugar just to fuck you up faster.No wonder my A1c was so high, I thought all this time I was eating healthy!You were eating as much raw sugar as I could get in you.I used to put extra sugar in your cherry punch, Id spoon it in your mouth when you were sleeping, and you lost your leg because of me!Got that bitch?Me!the butler yelled.Theresa pushed the forward button on her power chair and rammed the butler in the shins knocking him to the floor.That for you, you fucking ass!Teresa yelled.Toby whispered to Lisa, How come none of us are helping?This is too good, Lisa replied.It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.Yeah, if I only had popcorn, Toby said.Just then Theresa pushed herself off the wheelchair and thrust her obese body onto the butler who was lying on his back holding his shins in pain.When Theresa landed on top, he let out a breath as his ribs began to snap like dry kindling.In a few minutes, he was dead due to lack of oxygen.Later that day, after the cops showed up, Lisa, Toby and Judd left the house, after stealing a nice camera and headed out to do the photo shoot that Lisa and Judd planned to do in the first place.This time they picked a location that was on public ground, but was out of the way so nobody would see what they were doing.Lisa still planned to get naked and bang herself for the camera.Where do you want me to stand?Lisa asked.Toby spoke up, Over by that tree.Judd didnt like people hijacking his photo shoots and replied, No, sit on the ground in that shady spot, pointing to an open area.I like the tree better, Toby said.I like the shade better, Judd said, Im the photographer, this is my shoot, if you want to shoot models, get your own.You dont have to be such an asshole, Toby said.Im just trying to help.Well, if you want to help, shut your hole and stand behind me, I dont want your shadow in the picture.Pissed, Toby walked around and stood behind Judd.Ok, Judd said to Lisa.Spread your legs and let me see what you got.Lisa spread her legs and showed Judd her freshly shaven clam.It was a work of art.Now, use your fingers and spread it apart, I want to see all your girly parts.Lisa complied and Judd got in close for a tight shot.Put a finger inside, he said.Lisa put a finger inside and said, What should I do with my face?Pretend like youre having an orgasm, Judd replied.Ok, Lisa said and made a face like she was about to explode.How is that?she asked.Very nice, now roll to your right.Toby spoke up, No, to your left, he said.Judd looked back at Toby and scowled at him.Say one more thing and youre out of here!Toby replied, Ive known her for a long time, she likes it when I help, right?he asked Lisa.Lisa didnt reply.See, now leave us alone, go chew on a tree or something, Judd said.Pissed, Toby walked over to the side of the clearing and sat with his back to a tree.He folded his arms and stewed.Judd went back to posing Lisa while Toby watched.Toby became jealous of the attention Lisa was getting from this man and fondly remembered shooting him in the face repeatedly.The feeling he had were now starting to simmer and he was not going to let this douche have his way with his girl.Toby waddled back over to Judd and looked over his shoulder.That looks like hell, Toby said.Judd turned around and pointed at Toby, right in the face, One more comment and youre a dead beaver!You got me?Toby stood up and gave Judd the look that said, Fuck with me, go ahead.Dont give me that shit, Ill fuck you up, now get the fuck out of here!Toby looked over at Lisa who was doing a full spread pussy shot.She was getting annoyed as well.What kind of photographer are you?You cant set up a shot to save your life, look at your lighting, look at the background, youre nothing but an amateur, Toby said.Judd set the camera down and stood up.He was a full three feet taller than Toby who refused to back down.It was like a classic western standoff, only no one had guns.Leave, Judd said.This is public property and youre making porn, Im not going anywhere, Toby replied.Ill give you till the count of three.Go for it fuck wad, Toby replied.One, two...Just then Toby pulled a forty four magnum pistol from under his fur and pointed it at Judds face.Are you sure about this big boy?Where did you get that gun?Its almost as big as you?I have a conceal carry permit, Id show it to you but I left it in my wallet at home, Toby said.Youre going to shoot me over a photo shoot?Judd asked.No, you threatened to kick me, nobody threatens me.How does it feel to be on the opposite side of the gun?Toby asked.Sucks, Judd replied.I like that, short and to the point.Now what?Judd asked.You need to shit or get off the pot.Oh, Ill get off the pot alright, Toby said.Dont you worry about that.Whats going on?Lisa asked, her finger still planted firmly in her vagina.Judd spoke up, Looks like your boyfriend here is planning to blow my head off.Lisa pulled her finger out and stood up.She walked as close as she dared to the two and said, Toby, now you leave Judd alone, he didnt mean any harm.Toby kept his eye on Judd, keeping the gun pointed at his head.Im sure he did, he just didnt expect me to defend myself.Just because Im small doesnt mean I dont pack a punch.Now what are you going to do motherfucker?Toby asked.Lisa spoke up, Put down the gun, Ill cancel the shoot, alright?I want him to tell me how much of a fuck up he is first, Toby said.Youre fucking nuts if you think Im bowing down to you, you freaking rat.Toby smiled, You think calling me a rat bothers me?Ive been called a rat by worse men than you.For the longest time, all three stood there waiting for someone to make a move.
