Saw the footage of you in Aspen.That was impressive for not having ridden in two years.He was fishing, trying to see if her hiatus had been real or if she had made up the whole thing for a more dramatic comeback.When you want it, you want it.Was all Lenny would reveal.Serge smiled at her response and saluted her with his beer.She felt her phone buzz in her pocket and pulled it out.Her heart almost stopped when she saw Lukes number on the screen.She excused herself and stepped over to a corner that was more quiet.Hello?She asked, her hands and voice shaking.Lenny heard lots of voices at once, like from a club or restaurant.She thought maybe he had accidentally pocket dialed her and then he spoke.Hello?He was speaking loudly and didnt sound like himself.Luke?Lenny asked, confused.Lenny?Luke asked in return.Lenny could hear giggling in the back ground.Are you drunk?Lenny was trying to stay calm but she could feel her neck heating up.Did he really call her while he was with another girl?I might be drunk.Luke laughed loudly.Why are you calling me?Lenny asked forcefully.Im calling cuzhold on.She heard him moving around and it got quieter in the background.He mustve moved to a different room.Lenny?Luke asked.Im still here, she answered.It was quiet for a few seconds and Lenny swallowed the lump that had formed in her throat.I miss you, Luke finally said.I miss you too, she replied.And she did.Oh, how she missed him.I need you to come back.His words were slurred and Lenny knew for sure that he was drunk.Just come home to me and we can fix this whole mess.Im in Alaska, Luke  she started but he interrupted.Why?Are you with Duke?I know hes in love with you!Is that why you left me?For him?His tone was suddenly combative.Definitely drunk.No.Duke is back home.I didnt leave you for anyone.Lenny knew that trying to explain anything to him in this state would be useless.Her arms ached to hold him.You said you loved me Lukes voice broke and Lenny could feel tears starting to form in her eyes.I do love you, Luke, she whispered.Then you why did you leave?His voice kept swinging from heartbroken to angry.Luke, we cant have this conversation when youre drunk, she pleaded with him.Call me tomorrow, well talk then,  Luke seemed to consider her request.He sighed heavily, Okay.Ill call tomorrowLenny?Yeah?I love you, you know.I know.She hung up the phone, her heart heavier than when she started out that day.Words of love could only mean so much spilling from the lips of a drunk.She hoped he would call her tomorrow but knew the chances that he would even remember their conversation was unlikely.She put her phone back in her pocket and rejoined her group.Ben had noticed her tense phone conversation and came to sit beside her on the vacant stool.You wanna talk about it?he asked.No, Lenny smiled at him apologetically.Sorry, I just wouldnt know what to say I guess.She pushed her beer away, suddenly disgusted by the taste.Let me know if I can help in any way.Ben said sincerely.I will.Lenny smiled and flagged the bartender down.She ordered some club soda and eased her way back into the conversation around the bar.She tried to not be distracted by her recent phone call.She had wanted him to call so badly.But she hadnt wanted him to call while he was drunk.She tried to push the memory of the girlish giggles in the background far from her thoughts.They werent together, he was allowed to do whatever he wanted.Luke got home late that night.He didnt really know how hed gotten home, he just knew he was there now.Trying to get his key to go into the lock.He staggered and fell down in the hallway.He looked up at the door knob and frowned.His eyes couldnt quite focus and he blinked hard to clear the fog.He pushed himself back into a standing position and tried again.Suddenly the door opened and Sway hauled him inside.What the hell?Sway was angry, Luke could tell and it cracked him up.He laughed loudly at Sway's cranky expression.Where have you been?Sway demanded as Luke stumbled and then fell in the living room.I went out, Luke slurred and tried to stand up again.Sway stared at him, in complete shock.Luke hadnt gotten drunk in years.This was so unlike him.This was the old Luke.The Luke none of them could stand.You smell like the perfume counter at Macys, Sway accused.Yeah, Luke laughed as he found a seat on the couch, Girls like me.Youre joking, right?Sway was beyond disappointed.Luke looked like hell.His clothes were all a mess and his shirt was barely buttoned.Sway had had enough.Youre an asshole!He shouted at Luke.Luke winced but didnt say anything.Youre in love with Lenny!What have you done?!Luke stood up angrily.She left me, Sway!She left me!Luke shouted back.So that makes it okay to screw some nobody!Sway was shaking with fury.No!Luke was shaking his head in protest, confused by his own foggy memories and his overwhelming grief.I just bought some drinks.I didnt His voice faltered, too drunk to think clearly.I didnt want to be alone He collapsed back onto the sofa and hung his head.Its just as well she left, Sway said sharply, You never deserved her.He slammed the door to his bedroom, leaving Luke alone in the dark.20    Learn To Fly      Blake had gone down to the corner store to get a few things.Nothing crucial; fresh produce and some milk.He carried his basket to the counter and waited patiently in line.His eyes casually browsed the tabloid covers, just like anyone else would.He paused on one in particular.He blinked his eyes hard and squinted, thinking he was seeing things.He grabbed the magazine off the rack and stuck it in his basket.He kept his face stoic as he paid for his items and left.In the elevator ride up to his loft, Blake pulled the magazine out and studied the cover again.He hadnt been seeing things.It was a picture of Luke making out with some chick.The headline read: LUKE CASEY CAUGHT CHEATING!LENNA HUMILIATED AND IN HIDING!Blake stepped out of the elevator and quickly opened the door to his loft.He set his purchases down on the counter and opened the cheaply printed multicolored pages.Normally, he would never even look at these types of stories.They were always false and misleading, designed to cause trouble.But the sickening feeling in Blakes stomach forced him to look at the rest of the photos.The magazine had a full spread on Lukes indiscretions.He was pictured sitting in a bar with an unknown girl on his lap.His shirt was unbuttoned and her hands were all over his chest.The article quoted eye witnesses as describing Luke to be very drunk and making out and dancing with several women all night long.Blake ground his teeth together.This was a local, overnight publication, meaning that the events had happened within the past twenty four hours and usually within the city limits.But it would go national in a few days.Lenny would see it eventually.That was it.Blake knew, Luke had lost her forever.Luke climbed out of unconsciousness in the spare room of Sways apartment, his head throbbing.He sat up slowly and winced at the added pain from the minimal effort.He rested his head in his hands as he swung his legs to the floor, trying to clear the fog that had built up in his mind.He couldnt remember anything from last night but he knew he felt terrible.His stomach felt like he had swallowed pure acid and he wasnt sure if he was going to throw up or not.He hadnt been this hungover in a very long time.He looked down at the clothes he was still wearing from the night before and flashes of memory fired through his brain but he couldn't tell what was real and what had been a dream.He stood up and made his way to the bathroom for a hot shower.As the steam swirled around him, he tried to focus his thoughts, deciphering reality from nightmare.He had gone to a bar.He kind of remembered Sway being pissed at him when he came home.He got out of the shower and dried himself off, no better than when he had woken up.He was getting dressed when Sway started yelling at him to come out into the living room.Whats up man?Luke wasnt sure if this was just a continuation of their fight from last night or if this was something new.He really wished he could remember more.Sway threw a cheap magazine on the table and Luke was even more confused than he had been a moment ago.You cant stay here.Sway said calmly, his jaw working under his skin.Not if youre gonna live like this.Luke frowned and walked over to the tabloid, squinting at the cover.His eyes widened and he flipped to the inside.His stomach lurched and bile rose in his esophagus as he was confronted with the decisions hed made the night before.The memories came back in a blurry rush and he staggered to the sofa to sit down, unable to speak.Does this mean you dont want Lenny anymore?Sway asked, his face flat and emotionless.Luke looked around, trying to get his bearings.Thats not what he had wanted at all.He just wanted to feel differently than how hed been feeling.He looked back at the photos with sudden realization, he didnt want her to see these.He quickly pulled out his phone and checked his call history.He had called her last night.He closed his eyes and tried to concentrate but he couldnt remember what they had talked about.He looked up at Sway with desperation.No, his voice cracked, Shes the only one I want.Sway shook his head and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand.Did you sleep with any of those girls?Sway asked, his face cold and dispassionate.The memories were muddy but he could almost put them in order now.No.I came straight home from the bar, alone.Luke was positive of that.It didnt matter how drunk he had gotten, his goal hadnt been to get laid.Sway sighed and paced across the living room a few times.I dont know how youre gonna fix it.You know shes gonna see this eventually.Luke thought he had reached the lowest point in his emotional fortitude the day before.But this was a whole new level of loss.How was he ever going to get her back now?She was so much better than his behavior dictated.She deserved better than him, no wonder she had left.Why had he been so determined to prove that he didn't need her?At this point, when he realized what a life without her actually looked like, he knew what kind of a moron he really was.The worst kind.He'd regressed to old habits to ease his pain and in doing so, may have destroyed any opportunity to get back the one woman that mattered to him.Maybe Sway began and Luke looked up at him, hope making a tentative step back into his heart.I might have an idea Sway grimaced at him.But let's be clear about something, I am not pleased with your actions.You've really messed up this time.Luke nodded in agreement.But you've bailed all of us out at one time or another, the least we can do is help you pull your head out of your ass.He sighed with disappointment and ran his hand through his hair, We have to have a family meeting.Lenny awoke with a smile.The skies were clear and powder was waiting.She dressed quickly and quietly in the early morning, careful not to wake Shelby Lynn who had gone to bed far too late.All that flirting with Travis Jenkins, Lenny snickered to herself.She practically ran to the Lodge for breakfast.She yanked open the door and was greeted with the smell of pancakes and bacon, her stomach growled in happy anticipation.Ben and Serge waved to her from a table near the back and she joined them.Taking off her coat and hanging it on the back of her chair, she sat down across from Serge and next to Ben.Good morning!She greeted as she poured herself a steaming cup of coffee from the pot on the table.Youre in a good mood this morning, Ben noticed out loud.Uh, duh.Im in freaking Alaska, Lenny deadpanned.Serge chuckled softly at her.Here, fill up.Ben passed her a platter of food and she gladly dug in.Nick is gonna take us out for a test run first, Serge said.Then well meet up with the others at their chosen location.Lenny circled the table with her finger, Just us?Serge nodded but didn't pause in eating.You think you can hang with the big dogs?Ben teased from next to her.Do you?Lenny countered with one eyebrow up, taking another bite of pancakes.She really enjoyed how being at a higher altitude meant you could eat more calories.Smitty is teaching the kids how to build a jump out of nothing, Ben added.Nice.I hope they give me a crack at it.I havent gotten a chance to run one of Smittys kickers in a long time, Lenny said thoughtfully.Remember when Duke wrecked last time you were here?Serge mentioned with a smirk.Gosh, yes!I thought he was gonna kill himself that trip.Lenny shook her head at the memory.I woulda done it too had I known that you were playing nurse that weekend.Ben laughed and winked at Lenny.What?Lenny smiled, confused.Well, it was obvious that Duke was being more reckless to get your attention.We assumed it was because he got to spend more one on one time with you.Oh, stop, Lenny made a face.She knew Duke had feelings for her but it was a shock to find out that everyone else knew before she did.What else didn't she know?Yeah, he threatened all of us to back off.Ben laughed at Lennys face.Dont worry, Lenny, Serge said seriously, If anyone wrecks this week, Ill play nurse.Lenny laughed at Serges dry humor.She knew he sensed her awkwardness at this particular topic and she was thankful for his appropriately timed joke.Can I join you guys?Lenny looked up to see Shane standing at the vacant chair.He was addressing Lenny specifically.His unflinching eye contact made her heart skip momentarily.I dont mind.Lenny responded with a casual smile and then looked back to her food.That was weird.She was not going to let him get under her skin.Shane took a seat and began filling his plate.The table was quiet for a few minutes and Lenny couldnt help but feel responsible for that.She was the one who had aired Shanes horrible transgressions to the entire world.And these had been his comrades, his teammates.They shouldnt have had to choose sides in a personal problem that was between Lenny, Shane and Cody.Are you coming with us in the heli, Shane?Lenny asked awkwardly.Shed just a soon put the past behind them.If that meant she had to be the bigger person, than so be it.Yeah, Nick asked me if Id go so he could help Smitty with the jump.Shane kept his face flat and didnt look up from his food.If thats okay with you, that is, he added at the end.Lenny swallowed as Ben and Serge looked at her for a response.Of course.Were all here for the same reasons, right?She smiled nervously.To get some good vertical rides in?Serge nodded his approval and went back to eating.Ben studied Lennys face longer than she was comfortable with and she started to chew on the inside of her cheek.Shane didnt respond at all.He poured himself a cup of coffee and continued eating.Lenny suddenly felt bad about what she had done to him a few weeks back.This man at the table was not the same flashy, egocentric playboy she had spent so much time hating.This was all new territory.Before long, they were waiting outside for the helicopter pilot, Jack.They had their gear ready and Lenny could feel her pulse quicken.Being taken to a high peak and dropped off by a helicopter was one of her favorite experiences.Nothing compared.Well, maybe kissing Luke.Lenny tried to shake that thought off as quickly as it had crept up on her.The heli started to get warmed up and they loaded their gear inside.Soon they were cleared to board and take off.The scenery of the Alaskan mountains was breathtaking.Serge spoke with the pilot and they scouted out a stately peak.All the passengers disembarked onto the snowy top and watched the heli fly away.Lenny pulled her hat a little lower on her ears as the wind whipped past her face.She was terrified and excited at the same time.Duke would have never allowed her to get to a height of this kind.He had always restricted how much alone time she spent with Serge.He was afraid Serge was a bad influence on Lennys fearlessness and would encourage her to be more risky than was necessary.Lenny felt like a rebellious teenager hanging out with the bad boy in home room.She looked at Serge, he was all business.This kind of extreme was why he had made the trip to begin with.Who wants to go first?Serge asked the group of them after the helicopter had gotten far enough away to hear each other.Ben looked more nervous than Lenny had ever seen him.Shane was too.Serge seemed to be the only one ready for a ride of this magnitude.Ill go first.Lenny found herself volunteering.Her heart was stuck in her throat.She liked to be first to descend for a lot of reasons.The main one being to pick your own line without anyones influence.But the added bonus of looking like a badass in front the boys was cool too.She couldnt see Serges expression behind his goggles and face mask but his approval was apparent in his posture.Thats insane!Ben protested.You havent dropped a line in too long to be the first at this height.He took a step to get in front of Lenny to stop her.Shane put in arm up, pushing Ben back slightly.Ben frowned at him, perplexed.Dude.Shes got this.Shane said confidently.Lenny looked up , surprised at Shanes sudden support.He was looking at her with different eyes.She had noticed something strange the first night at camp but couldnt quite place it.He was avoiding direct eye contact most of the time anyway.But not now.Now, he was looking at Lenny with eyes of a man who had too many regrets and had decided to do something about it.You're kidding, right?Ben was incredulous.Shane kept his eyes on Lenny as he answered calmly.Shes gonna be just fine, Calloway.Shes the best.He said it without a hint of sarcasm and Lenny tried to downplay the shock that rippled through her.Ben shook his head like he thought Shane had lost his mind, Lenny knew how he felt.But she wasn't going to let anyone else know that.Whyd you come up here if you didnt want to play?Lenny teased.The adrenaline was starting to kick into high gear.I just dont think you should go first.Ben grumbled when it was obvious he had lost the argument.Serge stood back, completely relaxed, waiting for the squabble to clear.Lenny envied his cool focus.She dug out her chute and fastened her binders.She grinned at the guys and lowered her goggles, giving a final dramatic salute for beginning her descent.She started out slowly on her vertical.The angle was steep, probably fifty degrees or more.She was careful, feeling her way as she went.She didnt want to jump past the hard parts and fly to the end.She wanted to enjoy this, every death defying, exhilarating moment.Interestingly enough, a drum beat started to resonate in her head.It was the opening song for Double Blind Study on the tour.She didnt feel sad or weird, it felt good.And motivating.As her board started its expert curve down the extreme slope she heard the guitar riff join in and her heartbeat quickened.The sky was an overwhelming blue.Deep and clear at the same time.The white landscape was bare and open, waiting for her to carve a line right through it.She bent and twisted, feeling the fresh powder cave and respond, propelling her forward.She would speed up and then slow down, controlling her movements, controlling her momentum.Lenny was flying.She hadnt felt freedom like this in a long time.Far longer than she cared to think about.The air was as clean and pristine as the snow she was slashing in.Her line curved and arced, throwing clouds of powder around her.Creating a beautiful effect for her brilliant blue riding suit to burst through.Shane felt a grin spread across his face behind his mask.He knew she would be fine.He watched in appreciation.He knew Lenny was good.He had just never realized how good.It was like the mountain belonged to her and changed to make her path possible.Alright, Calloway, Serge said from behind him and clapped his hand on the kid's shoulder, Youre up.Ben nodded but he was still pretty nervous.You got this, kid.Shane said with a pat on the shoulder.You can follow Lennys line all the way down, shes not as crazy as Duke.Shane waited till Ben got started and then he turned to Serge.I assume youll be last.He nodded at the composed Norwegian.Serge stepped aside in answer, giving Shane room to pick a chute.In the past, Shane would have never taken this trip.He had always preferred to ride maintained parks and pipes.Back country riding scared him beyond belief.But after losing Lenny permanently and than having his idiocy thrown around the media, he realized that even playing it safe, you can make a mess.He started small, little trips to the unpopulated runs, trying out fresh powder and learning the feel of riding untamed terrain.It didnt take long for him to get hooked.And when Federa invited him to come to Alaska, he jumped at the chance.This was his largest descent as well but he wasnt scared of the ride.The thing that scared Shane was dressed in blue and coming to a stop at the bottom of the mountain.Lenny came to a halt and pushed up her goggles.She was breathless and heated up from her ride so she removed her face mask and hat as well.She turned to watch Ben cut a smooth line very near hers.It made her feel good, she had blazed a trail to be proud of.She watched in curiosity as Shane started his own run.He was a little further away from where she had started.She had never seen him ride big mountains before.All the time they were together, he had made it abundantly clear that he was not into that sort of thing.He was good in the pipe and that had always been his focus.She was curious as to what had changed his mind.Ben slid up next to her, and pushed his coverings off his face.He had a goofy grin plastered on and he gave Lenny a high five.Shane made his descent with precision and Lenny was impressed.When he reached them at the bottom she impulsively patted his shoulder in congratulations.Shane took off his goggles and gave Lenny a warm look.Bet you didnt think I could pull it off.He said with a sideways smile.Im not gonna lie, I was a little surprised.Lenny tried to read his expression but he looked away from her inquisitive stare.Whatever had happened to Shane was a very big deal.He was like a brand new person.Damn, check out Serge Ben said with awe.They all turned to observe the living legend take his turn raging down the face.It was a thing of beauty.Serge moved with the fluidity of a spider in an intricate web; in and out, back and forth.The snow bursting from beneath his board as if announcing his arrival to the rest of the world.Do you think he knows how good he is?Lenny wondered out loud.Hes definitely fearless, Shane remarked.Im not that brave.He glanced at Lenny with adoration.Lenny is, though.Lenny smiled wistfully, still staring at Serges perfect form and style.Sometimes, she agreed noncommittally.When Serge finished his run and humbly accepted the group's praise, he radioed the heli and Jack swung around to pick them up again.They flew a short distance away to a smaller slope where Nick and Smitty had helped the youngins build a jump.Youre gonna fly a hundred feet off that thing!Nick was hollering at Smitty.They were having an argument about the safety of the jump theyd just finished.That was the plan, dummy.Smitty wiped the sweat off his brow and squinted up the hill.It aint fun unless you can get hurt.Maybe for you and me, thats true.But theyre just kids.Nick protested.Would you calm down?Smitty was losing his patience.They dont have to try it if they dont want to.No one is forcing them.Nicks mouth twitched in agitation.Smitty was right, but he didnt have to like it.At the top of the run, the other riders were nervously preparing.No one was talking about their anxiety, they were all pretending like they had none.Lenny laughed to herself.She remembered feeling that way at that age too.Like, if you act like youre invincible than maybe you will be.So, who wants to try it first?Lenny asked with a grin.Its Smittys kicker, maybe he should go first.Trucker suggested.Ill go first.Travis Jenkins suddenly spoke up.He wanted to prove his manhood, no doubt.The competitiveness surrounding the entire outing was thick enough to choke on.Lenny sidled up to Travis as he tightened his bindings.Hey.She took a knee next to him and gazed out over the stark white landscape.We can do this run all day.Save your big stuff for after you get to know the run a few times.Jenkins had a rep for being flashy and bold in the pipe and on the freestyle course.Lenny didnt want his day to be cut short just because he didnt find the right balance.Travis frowned at her, trying to not to hear her words as a challenge.All Im saying is, Lenny continued, reading his hesitation, This isnt a park.Its okay to be scared.If youre not a little bit frightened, the mountain will eat you alive.She patted his shoulder as he nodded at her words and got into a standing position.As Travis traveled down the packed, slick run towards the ramp, Lenny watched in satisfaction.He was controlling his speed and making the slight adjustments that an experienced rider would make.He took the jump at a pretty strong velocity and spun into the air.She could see him tracking the landing already.He set down with a wobble but didnt lose his balance.She was happy he had taken her advice.Then it was Truckers turn.Jimmy Trucker was always reckless and never smart.He was addicted to the thrill and possibly the crash.He let out a loud whoop and took off going at a ridiculous speed.The moment he flew into the air, Lenny knew hed lost control.He didnt just crash, he rolled and bounced and crashed repeatedly.His board disengaged and his body continued on, getting buried slightly in the snow he had disturbed on his way down.Everyone waited for movement before rushing to him.He flopped over on his back and let out a loud moan.Ill check him.Lenny said, tightening her binders.She was cautious on the slick run but had achieved a good speed when she reached the jump.As she flew into the air she got the distinct impression that she was indeed flying this time.She did a quick method to please the onlookers and tracked her landing.The snow was rough and uneven from where Trucker had epically wiped out.She tried to place her board in as smooth a location as she could find at her altitude.Little wobble, nothing she couldnt handle.She turned her board sideways and skidded to a halt near Truckers crumpled form.Unhooking her bindings, she jogged over to him and peered down into his face mask.Some things never change, Truck, she said with mock disappointment.He groaned in response.Thats not true.Im a heck of a lot older this year.Lenny laughed and began to check his body for broken bones before trying to move him.Satisfied that it was just a couple of bumps, she helped him into a sitting position.Thanks, Len, Trucker grimaced at the pain in his ribs as she helped pull him to a standing position.Youre done for the day, Lenny said apologetically.Yeah, I hope I can move in the morning.Trucker attempted a laugh and then held his side.Let me take a look at those ribs.Lenny peeled off his coat and pulled his shirt up to expose his left side.It was red and already swollen; tender to the touch.You might have a few cracked ribs, Truck, she said with concern.You know what they say, big mountain thrills equal hospital bills.Trucker tried to laugh again.Maybe you should go back to camp, Lenny suggested tentatively.Nah, Ill be fine.Trucker dismissed her with a wave as he pulled his coat back on.I wanna see how everyone else fairs.Okay, Lenny relented and trudged over to collect her board.But stay down here, I meant what I said, youre done riding for the day, she instructed seriously.Whatever you say, mama.Trucker smiled and walked over to join Travis who had been watching from a distance.Lenny whirled, expecting to see Blake but no, it was still Trucker.No one had called her that in a few weeks and it ignited her repressed heartache.She shook it off as she climbed back up to the start where the others awaited.Is he okay?Shelby Lynn looked scared.Yeah, hes fine.Lenny waved it off.Hes just gonna be sore tomorrow.She took this as a teaching opportunity and addressed the remaining riders.Smitty builds some pretty gnarly jumps, guys.Take your first run easy.Learn it first before you trick it.She pointed at Jimmy Trucker.Or youll spend the rest of the trip watching.And thats not why youre here.They nodded like obedient children and Lenny suppressed a laugh.A few years ago, no one would have taken her seriously.And now she was one of the adults.Bossing around rock stars all summer had its benefits.Ben went next and then Shelby Lynn.Eventually, everyone took a turn.All of them followed Lennys advice and kept it cautious for the first few runs.They started to get brave and added in little grabs, flips and rotations as they got more comfortable.Did I impart wisdom?Lenny asked Serge as they looked on.He only gave his quiet, knowing smile.Lenny enjoyed being near Serge.His energy was both calming and ferocious.He reminded her of a cat.He could be completely relaxed one minute, eyes half lidded, nearly asleep and then on the move, twisting and hurtling down the mountainside the next.Cmon, Lenny!Nick called from the top of the slope, Show us something special.Lenny smiled and removed her jacket.Even though they were surround by snow, the sun and extra activity was making them all warm.Travis had long since removed his shirt, much to the joy of Shelby Lynn, and Lenny decided to be more comfortable as well.She took off her hat and outer shirt, stripping to her black snow pants and orange tank top.She lowered her goggles and her blonde hair hung in sweaty strands down her back.Serge offered her a fist bump as she strapped in.The slope was even more slick than before because of all the activity but Lenny liked the extra speed it provided.She would need it for what she was about to attempt.You have to cool it, Calloway.Serge said from next to Ben.Ben turned, eyes wide with surprise and confusion.What?You are not the one.Serge said calmly, as they watched Lenny take off and head towards the jump.What do you mean?Ben asked as he stared at Lenny flying into the air.She did a corked 180 backside, her body a swirl of color and skin, and landed gracefully.The trick was flawless and the other riders applauded.I am talking about Lenny.Serge turned his pale, serious eyes on Ben.You are not the one, do not waste your time.Ben forced a laugh, embarrassed by the reprimand.Whos The One, Serge?You?Ben asked, holding his mittened hands up to symbolize the air quotes.No, Serge answered and bent down to tighten his bindings for his own run.Not me.Not you.Ben watched Serge follow Lenny with an equally impressive run.He was befuddled by Serges comments.Did Lenny say something to Serge?As far as Ben knew, she was fair game.She wasnt seeing anyone and neither was he.Flirting couldnt hurt, right?Bens gaze drifted to Shane Brookings who was also watching Lenny.Theyd been friendly with each other all day.That didnt mean there was something going on there, did it?Surely Im better than that guy!Ben thought defensively.Shane was a moron.Lenny had to have better taste than that.She wouldnt want to be with someone who was a known womanizer, would she?21    No Way Back      Sways solution involved a lot of ass chewing, Luke found out very quickly.He had called the guys and with quite a bit of coercing and slight extortion, Sway got them to agree to meet at Blakes loft.It was like an intervention, Luke noted.His closest friends were there, along with Carl and Harrisons sister, Miranda.It was similar to when they had all confronted Mike on his drug use.They sat Luke down on the couch and proceeded to tell him all the things he had done wrong and how it had affected their lives.It would have been comical if wasnt so tragic.Luke had been so wrapped up in his feelings for Lenny he never stopped to realize that she was very much a part of the rest of the band.She had been woven into their hearts and music.How one girl could have such a lasting impact on one band was beyond Lukes reasoning.He knew how she had affected him, but he was in love with her.He was finding out the others loved her as well, but in different ways.She had become equally important and vital to them.They missed her and they wanted her back.And now this thing with the tabloids  Youre an idiot, Blake said disdainfully.Remember, Blake, Miranda quietly reminded, Use feeling words.I feel  I feel that you are an idiot, Blake restated in exasperation.Miranda closed her eyes and sighed.Its okay, Ran, Luke said, Blakes right, I am an idiot.So what are you gonna do about it?Blake asked pointedly.Well, I was hoping youd help me.Luke looked around the room at his friends, settling on Sway.Sway nodded and took over.We are going to help him.He started, giving stern looks to the eye rolls.Luke has helped us all out of terrible things.This is simply an opportunity for us to return the favor.What do you have in mind?Mike hadn't stopped glaring at Luke since he'd arrived and Luke didn't blame him.Mike had tried to help him and Luke had slammed the door in his face.I'm an asshole.You know that song you wrote for Lenny?Sway focused on Luke again and he nodded.Were gonna record it and release it.Right away.The room was silent.How does that help?Luke finally asked, feeling unsure.But not listening to his friends hadn't gotten him very far.Shell hear it and itll soften her heart.Sway rolled his eyes at Luke's absurdity and kept going.And then you gotta go to Jackson Hole and beg her to forgive you for being a complete douche bag.You bring the biggest diamond you can find and you get down on one knee   One knee?People still do that?Miranda interrupted.Get down on one knee, Sway continued, throwing a scowl in Mirandas direction.And you ask her to marry you.You really think he can sing her a little song and shes just gonna forget Skank Gate and promise to love him forever?Harrison had been relatively quiet during the whole event.Until now.He stood and grabbed his hair in both hands.You have pictures of you playing Who Can Be The Whoriest with a random floozy circulating through the general populous!Am I the only one who has noticed this?Harrisons voice continued to raise.Lenny was supposed to be your soul mate!What the hell were you doing with other girls at all?!Luke swallowed and hung his head.He didnt have any words with which to defend himself anymore.He knew Harrison was right.And he didnt deserve Lennys forgiveness let alone a second chance.I agree with Harrison.Carl's gruff voice joined in.Lenny is smart, and she's too good for you.He shrugged and leaned back in his seat, his peace having been said.The room fell quiet again as everyone stared at Luke.They all knew he had seriously screwed up big this time.Lenny was smart, she wasnt going to let some guy treat her like a cheap novelty item and be okay with it.Luke felt the hopelessness of the situation pulling his insides apart.It couldn't end like this!He had loved her with truth and passion and fury, how could it end with a kiss goodbye at the airport?No fight?No conviction?No effort?Lukes anger rose to the surface and he bolted to a standing position, making everyone around him jump.No, he said forcefully, It doesnt end like this.Not yet.She might not want me but I still want her.And she needs to know that.He turned to Sway, Get the studio, tonight if you can.Sway nodded and pulled out his phone.Luke pointed at Harrison.Dont stop pointing out what a dick Ive been.He pointed at Blake and Mike next.You guys can both punch me if you want.Mike gave him a small smile and uncrossed his arms, Im just glad youre gonna fight for her.Me too, Blake concurred.Luke finally had the conviction he needed to fight for her and it might be too late.This plan might not work but he was willing to try anything at this point.He needed her more than he needed to feel sorry for himself.The song turned out as good as it could for the rush they put on it.The label agreed to release it immediately with no questions asked.Luke was hoping the song would reach Lenny before the photos.She was never one for reading tabloids but that didnt matter.It would be all over TV soon enough.Luke called his manager and told him to set up a few interviews for the next couple of days.Hed try to get out in front of it as soon as possible.The interviews went as expected.They showed the illicit photos and Luke tried to make it sound like it wasnt as bad as they made it out to be.He attempted to avoid using the phrase, we were on a break, but it came out a time or two.Mostly he tried to focus on the single and how much it meant to him and how in love he was with the person he wrote it for.They asked if it was for Lenny and he would neither confirm nor deny.Again, the hope being that Lenny would hear the words and not see the pictures.Then he flew to Jackson Hole.He wasnt sure what hed say when he got there.He just knew that he didnt want to say it over the phone.The flight seemed to take forever.He rented a car and drove to the Lodge, parking in the empty driveway.He tried to still his flipping stomach as he approached the front door.What if she was angry to see him?What if she was with someone else?What if she was with Duke?He took a deep breath and rang the doorbell.After a few minutes without an answer, he rang it again.Still nothing.No one was home.Luke looked up at the overcast sky.Maybe she was on a ride.Shed probably be back by dark.Luke got back in his rental and decided to wait.Luke woke up, startled.Someone was knocking on his window.He must have dozed off.It was dark outside, he wasn't sure how long hed been waiting.He opened his car door to find Duke frowning down at him.What are you doing here, Casey?Duke greeted roughly.Luke climbed out of the car and tried to look evenly into the taller mans eyes.I came to see Lenny, he answered as confidently as possible.Shes not here, Duke replied flatly.Luke saw a flicker of something in his eyes he couldnt place.Either Duke was glad to see him or he was going to punch him in the nose.When will she be back?Luke refused to be intimidated.Dukes jaw worked under his skin before he finally relented and gestured for Luke to come into the house.When he walked into the warmth of the Lodge, he noticed how empty it felt.She left.Duke said as he hung up his coat and proceeded to the kitchen.What do you mean, she left?Luke followed, feeling his world crash around him.He'd waited too long.I mean, you didnt call and she went to Alaska.Duke took out some milk and poured two glasses, offering one to Luke.Shes not here.Shes gone.When is she coming back?Lukes memory banks fired and he vaguely remembered having a conversation with Lenny that she was in Alaska.But he hadnt been sure if that memory was real or just a dream.Dont know.Duke took a drink of milk.You shouldve called.I know, Luke responded, feeling more defeated than he had all week.She was even further away now.Where in Alaska?Luke suddenly asked.Why not?He had the money and the time.Why couldnt he just go there?It didnt matter where they were when he told he loved her, she just needed to hear it.Valdez.With a bunch of other people.Duke's face was unreadable.He was obviously just as pissed at Luke as the rest of them.Luke thought for a few minutes before speaking again.I don't know what to do.I'm so backwards and turned around without her.I love that woman with everything I have.I can't stop trying until I'm positive she knows that.Duke nodded once and tried to hide his smile behind another drink of milk.This might be salvageable after all, Casey.It had been an amazing week.Getting up early, fresh rides all day long with the best in the sport, Lenny couldnt ask for more.Shed hardly had time to think about Luke, much less be surprised when he didnt call her back.He had been very drunk.Hed probably forgotten the whole conversation.It was just as well, Lenny thought, they should give each other some space to move on.As impossible as that seemed.The snow had started to come down in thick waves sometime in the middle of the night.Nick met everyone in the Lodge the next morning and explained that the current storm system moving through might last a couple days.His words were met with groans and complaints.But nothing could be done.They had to wait out the weather and then theyd be able to tackle the mountains again.The first day of the storm, everyone gravitated to the Lodge and played pool or watched TV.It wasnt so bad.The group was growing closer and more tight knit and the age gaps werent as apparent anymore.But by day two, people were going a little stir crazy.Lenny was watching a very dodgy game of darts between Ben and Trucker when Shane took a seat next to her on the couch.I was wondering if we could talk?He asked gently.Lenny turned sideways to face him.They were relatively alone.The Lodge was buzzing but no one was close enough to overhear a casual conversation.Sure, she answered sincerely.She and Shane had gotten along better during this trip than they had the entire time theyd known each other.The awkward tenseness that she had expected was nonexistent.He had been nothing but friendly and encouraging.It was as if their ugly breakup and following confrontation a few weeks ago had never happened.I guess, I just wanted you to know how sorry I am.Shanes amber eyes were pulled down at the sides in regret, taking Lenny off guard.I feel terrible about what I did to you.You were always so amazing to me and I really hurt you.Lenny had no idea Shane had wanted to have such a serious conversation.It was as good a time as any, Lenny supposed.She had a few things shed been wanting to clear up herself.Why did you stick around for so long after the accident?You couldve just moved on.She searched his eyes as he looked back, unblinking.Because I was really hoping maybe you did forget what Cody and I had done and we could pick where we left off.But there were other girls, Shanenot just Cody.Lenny reminded.Her previous anger had evaporated weeks, ago.It had been replaced with acceptance and curiosity.Yeah, I was a horrible boyfriend.Shane acknowledged.He looked at her earnestly.But, I think I did love you, as much I was capable of at the time.What does that mean?Lenny asked, her eyebrows pulling together.I didnt love you like you deserved.Shanes eyes were serious and sad.But I learned a lot from losing you.And I hope, someday, I can be your friend again.Lenny studied his face, he had gotten older when she wasn't looking.She had known Shane for a long time.They had a history, not a great one, but it was there nonetheless.She had never seen him more genuine and her heart changed in that moment.She decided to let go of the past.I forgive you, Shane.She reached over and laid her hand on his forearm.He looked up at her, relief creeping into his gaze.I didnt ask you to, he responded softly, his voice full of hope and wonder.No, but we both needed me to.Lenny gave him a crooked smile and moved to sit closer to him on the couch.He hesitantly put an around around her shoulders as she hugged up next to him.Thank you, Lenny.He rested his chin on the top of her head and she smiled.They couldn't go back and fix everything, and they would never be more than friends.But at least they could be friends and that meant more to Lenny than she had realized.She glanced over as Nick sat down nearby and started a conversation with those at the bar.The storm is actually getting worse.Lenny overheard Nick telling Smitty and Serge.We may have to move the kids into town till it passes.And thats exactly what happened.Nick announced a few hours later to pack up what they needed and they piled into a caravan of cars and trucks and headed to a hotel in Valdez.The hotel was nearly empty from other travelers and the group all got their own rooms on the same floor.It was almost like a college dorm, Lenny thought ruefully.Hopefully they would all behave themselves.Snowboarders forced to stay indoors due to inclement weather?Probably not.She decided to explore downtown Valdez and took Ben, Shane, Shelby Lynn and Travis in tow.They went in and out of little shops and stores, sometimes buying trinkets for family back home.They ate at a small restaurant that served fresh fish and lobster caught in the Sound.They were walking back to the hotel when Travis pulled the groups attention to a small music store.They entered and casually browsed the various merchandise.CDs, vinyls, t shirts, posters; every band imaginable.Lenny was flipping through a stack of old records when a familiar song started to play on the speakers overhead.She froze, listening to the first few notes on the guitar carefully, it couldnt becould it?Then a low, gravelly voice started in with the lyrics she knew by heart.It was her song.The song Luke had written for her.It sounded a little different, the whole band was playing, it was no longer acoustic.Lenny swallowed hard and looked around for the stores clerk.Spotting him near the register she slowly made her way that direction, trying to not draw any attention to herself.Excuse me, she flashed her most persuasive smile.The pudgy, curly haired clerk straightened up as she spoke.I was wondering what the name of the track is that you're playing right now.Ohuh, he held up a case, Its Double Blind Studys new single, Need.Just got it today.He handed the case over to Lenny for her to examine.She carefully took the plastic case and turned it over, her hands shaking.It was a stock photo of the band, nothing she hadnt seen a million times.Its weird, right?The clerk said with a laugh.What do you mean?Lenny looked up at him with a soft frown.Well, just that guy, he pointed to Luke on the cover.He writes this song for his girl and then goes off and cheats on her.What are you talking about?Lenny felt a hollowness in the pit of her stomach.The clerk pulled a tabloid out from under the counter and opened it to the pictures of Luke making out with a random girl.Lenny couldnt help but stare.She felt someone come up behind her but she didnt acknowledge them.I wonder if its a ploy to get more publicity, the clerk continued.Hes been all over TV and radio this week pushing their single and downplaying these tabloid pictures.Lenny was skimming the article for any mention of her.She knew she shouldnt.She felt dirty for even looking at this piece of trash like it was a legitimate news report but she couldnt stop herself.Yes, she was mentioned: Lenna Evans, former Olympian, humiliated by Caseys addiction to sex and booze, has been in hiding for weeks.Well, that wasnt true.Alaska was far away but she wasnt hiding.In every interview hes all: This song is for the love of my life.I mean every word, blah, blah, blah.The clerk was enjoying his own Luke impersonation.Cmon, Lenny, a strong voice said from next to her.An equally strong arm hooked around her waist and pulled her towards the door.We have to get back.Shane addressed the clerk, Thanks, man.You got cool stuff here.Lenny felt numb as she walked back to the hotel next to Shane.Her head was swirling with the pictures from the tabloid of the girl on Lukes lap with her tongue down his throat.Her hands had been twisted in his hair...the same way Lenny used to twist her fingers in it.She felt knifed, gutted, a sinkhole where here faith had been.It was so much more than what she had felt the night she had walked in on Cody and Shane.She had been forgotten.She wasn't sure how she made it all the way to her room and got her key out of her back pocket.Shane took the key from her and opened the door, helping Lenny inside.He gave a reassuring look to the rest of the group who had been watching with worried faces.Well see you guys downstairs for dinner.And he went inside Lennys room with her.She was rummaging through her luggage for some clean clothes.Having gone from lifeless to angry in the millisecond he wasn't looking.You okay?He asked apprehensively.Sure!Why wouldnt I be okay?Lenny snapped, throwing her clothes on the floor and rifling through them again.Im not sure what to say, except Im sorry.Shane tried to offer comfort.Thats rich, coming from you!She scoffed openly.I have great taste in men, dont I?I guess its true, you all want the same thing.I didn't put out so he replaced me.Shane frowned, about to protest.He wasnt sure exactly what to say.She had a right to be angry, especially with him.Lenny suddenly took off her shirt and flung it to the floor.She kicked out of her jeans and slid on a pair of shorts.Shane stared for a second before he averted his eyes.She grabbed her running shoes and quickly laced them up.In only her sports bra and running shorts, Lenny headed to the fitness center downstairs.Shane followed, unsure of what else to do.Lenny let herself into the weight room and immediately started her old routine; heavy weights, heavy squats, heavy presses.Shane recognized it right away.It was part of her physical rehab after her accident.But she was lifting way heavier than she had before.She was clearly going for complete muscle fatigue.Its a good song, Shane wasnt sure why he felt the need to defend Luke.Probably because the guy wasnt there to defend himself.Its a great song, Lenny grunted, Stupid me for thinking it was about me.How do you know its not about you?Shane countered, knowing he was walking a line that might end up with him getting smacked.Oh please.Its just another way to make money.If it was special, it would have stayed special and not been sold.She dropped her dumbbells with a thud.Its fine.Were not together.He can screw whatever tramp he wants.Shane watched her sweat for a few minutes and then decided it was best to leave Lenny alone.He didnt go far.He sat out in the lobby with one eye on the door and the other on the TV.Maybe Luke Casey would make an appearance on ET or something and fill in some of the blanks.Shane had been sitting in the same chair for almost two hours when Nick joined him.She still in there?Nick asked, having been filled in on the basics by a very concerned Shelby Lynn.Yep.Shane sighed and tossed down the magazine hed been reading.She lifted for nearly an hour and now shes running on the treadmill.You try talking to her?Nick asked.Sort of.Didnt go well.Im a little afraid, not gonna lie.Shane pursed his lips.Nick sighed heavily and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger.I called Dukethis is gonna get worse before it gets better.Nick spoke slowly, like he was afraid of the next few words he had to say.Shane narrowed his eyes at him.What do you mean?Lukes on his way here.His plane landed hours ago and I already checkedhes booked at this hotel.22    Victorian Machinery      Lennys skin was dripping with sweat.Her face was contorted and pinched as she pushed the maximum speed and incline on the treadmill.Her hair had almost completely broken free of the restraint and stuck in thick, sweaty tendrils to her bare shoulders and back.Salty streams ran into her face, blurring her vision and stinging her eyes.She didnt even bother wiping it away.Her lungs burned and her legs were on fire but she pushed on.She had to keep going.At least until she was numb and couldnt feel the hurt that was buried deep inside her.It wasnt fair.Every muscle fiber in her was screaming, trying to break free from the feelings that threatened to overtake her.She had done the right thing.She had to call it quits with Luke.One of them had to make the sacrifice.One of them had to be the grownup and see their situation for what it really was.Her breathing intensified with her thoughts.If she would have stayed, it could have only ended badly.He would have resented her for changing his life around and she couldnt bear the thought of him looking at her with regret in his eyes.She felt the sweat running in rivers between her shoulder blades.She breathed heavy out of her mouth, sending sweat spewing onto the display of the treadmill.She shouldve known better.She should have protected herself and never gotten involved with him.This was her fault.He hadnt done anything wrong.It was his job to write songs that squeezed the soul of the listener.She shouldnt have let herself think she was special.She was a temporary muse.A convenient inspiration.And now that she was out of the picture he was free to do whatever with whomever he chose.Isn't that exactly what Ashton had told her?She was replaceable.The hollow pit in Lennys stomach tightened as the pictures flashed in her mind again.This would be a lot easier for her to handle if she didnt have to remember every single thing in perfect detail.Her photographic memory was hell at times.This being one of them.Those images would never leave her mind.Just like she would never forget the things Shane and Cody had said to her.The same way she remembered the accident in vibrant color with all the special effects.It wasnt fair.No one should have to carry a burden so heavy; to see the one man she had ever loved in the arms of a random woman.Shane reentered the fitness room and took a seat on the weight bench.He clasped a towel in his hands on his lap and patiently waited.Lenny glanced at him and saw that he wasnt going to leave until he talked to her.She jumped to the sides of the treadmill and shut it off.Shane tossed her the towel and she wiped the sweat off her face.Feel better?Shane asked, his face and voice tense.No, Lenny shot back.She walked over and stood in front of him.Shed pretty much had enough of everyones bullshit.What do you want, Shane?She confronted contentiously.Nothing.Shane remained tactful, Just want to make sure youre okay.Im awesome.Lenny said sarcastically and strode to the door.Shane hurriedly got up to follow her.I dont need a babysitter, Shane.Lenny snapped.What she needed was this stupid storm to clear and a high vertical.She felt Shane's large body pressing too close and turned around to tell him to back off when she stopped in her tracks.Her eyes narrowed as a familiar shape came through the front doors and approached the desk.Shed recognize that saunter anywhere.Without thinking, she marched in that direction; Shane hot on her heels.He was saying something to her but she wasnt listening.All her thoughts and the adrenaline from her intense workout drowned him out.Hell hath no fury, right?What the hell are you doing here?Lenny confronted Luke.She crossed her arms over her chest and glared deeply at him.She had controlled her voice to keep from shouting but there was no mistaking the edge in her words.Luke was shocked to see Lenny at the hotel.He thought hed have to drive inland when the storm cleared.It had been difficult enough just getting from the airport to Valdez in the blizzard.He was tired and discouraged and he wasnt prepared to see Lenny.Especially with the fury with which she was greeting him.Her face was flushed and her hair was soaked, she was only wearing a sports bra and tiny running shorts.Her perfect skin ran with rivers of sweat, twisting and bending over her lean muscles.She would have looked completely gorgeous if she wasnt staring daggers at him.Luke tried to overlook Shane taking a protective stance behind Lenny.What the hell is he doing here?Im here to see you.Was all Luke could think of to say.Somehow professing his idiocy and undying love seemed inappropriate in the midst of her obvious ire.Lennys eyes flicked over to the receptionist and then back to Luke.She was trying to decide if this was, in fact, where she wanted to have the fight that was coming.She decided against it, turned abruptly on her heel and stormed to the elevators.Luke grabbed his room key off the desk and picked up his bag, hurrying after her.Can we talk?he asked her when they got to the lift.He ignored Shanes warning looks.Lennys eyes were severe when she looked at him.She didnt answer as she stepped inside the lift, Luke and Shane following.The ride to her floor was silent and Luke wasnt sure what to do next.When the doors opened and she charged to her room, he had no choice but to pursue her.She unlocked her door and let herself in, slamming it in Lukes face.He sighed and knocked.Lennyplease, can we talk?He asked through the thick wood.After a few moments without an answer, Shane touched Lukes shoulder.Maybe give her a few minutes.Shes pretty pissed at you right now.Luke frowned at him.When did I switch places with Shane?Doesnt Lenny hate this guy?Luke swallowed the words that wanted to lash out at Shane and took his key card from his pocket.He walked down the hall a few paces to his room that happened to be right next to Lennys, he noticed wryly.He dumped his bags and his coat and went back to Lennys door.Shane was still standing outside of it like some sort of bodyguard and Luke felt his anger at the situation growing.This was not part of the plan.He needed to talk to Lenny, and having this gargoyle watching his every move wasnt helping.He knocked on the door again.Lenny, please.Luke tried to reduce the frustration in his voice.Can we talk?Some doors down the hall opened and the rest of Lenny and Shanes group peaked their heads out in curiosity.Luke was positive they had all heard the rumors about their wild love affair during his last tour.Most of them had probably been filled in on the tabloid pictures and the recent song release.And they had all, more than likely, formed their own conclusions.Luke wasnt the good guy in any of them.They knew Lenny, of course they would be on her side.But that didnt mean they couldnt gawk at the rock star.Luke looked uncomfortably at the small audience that was gathering twenty or so paces down the hall.He knocked on the door again.Cmon, Lenny.He tried to plead again.Can we please talk?The door suddenly flew open.Lenny backed Luke up into the hallway.Her jaw clenched and her mouth formed in a hard line.Sure.Lets talk.Lenny crossed her arms over her chest.Who is she?What?Lukes eyebrows pulled together.The tart checking the depth of your throat with her tongue!Lenny took a step towards him and he backed up again.Shes notIuh Luke had never been on the receiving end of Lennys fury.He was at a loss for what to do.Wow.Realization hit Lenny.You dont even know her name, do you?The onlookers let out a collective gasp.Did you hear your song?Luke was flailing and he grabbed at his only defense.Oh, the song you said you wrote for me but then sold?Lenny stretched her hands out to the sides and let them fall, slapping against her thighs.You run out of ideas?Is that why youre here?You need me to help you find that next hit?She took on an aggressive stance and put her hands on her hips.What, hard up for cash after the tour?Being a philanderer must get expensive fast!Her voice dripped with sarcasm.Hey!Luke had about had enough.He pointed to his chest with both hands.How do you think I felt when you left?!I was lonely and I missed you and Im sorry about the girl, it just happened!Really?You were minding your own business and she tripped and fell and you caught her with your tongue?Lenny yelled.You LEFT!Luke shouted, taking a step forward and leveling a finger at her face.He knew he wasnt helping the situation but he couldnt stop himself.He was still angry with her for walking away.Besides, how do you think I feel when I get here and youre with him?Luke pointed at Shane.Is he helping keep your bed warm in Alaska?Luke knew he had crossed a line.He regretted it the moment he said it.The hurt and anger in Lennys eyes tore through him.Before Luke could take it back, Lennys hand flew to his face making a loud smack that was followed by silence.He stared at her in shock.Luke had never been slapped before.His cheek stung with the heat from her hand.Lennys eyes glossed over with tears and Luke instinctively reached for her but Shane, misreading Lukes intentions, stepped in between them.Lenny spun and retreated, slamming the door to her room.Shanes eyes bored holes into Lukes.Luke tried to step past him but Shane stood firm, his powerful body rigid.Alright, everyone.Serges calming voice cut through the tension.The show is over, it is time to get downstairs for dinner.He herded the wide eyed onlookers towards the elevators.Luke and Shane stood toe to toe, neither one of them moving.Serge and Nick sent the elevator on its way and approached the testosterone fueled standoff.This is needless, Serge reproved them.Shane, you should come downstairs with me.Im not leaving him alone with her, Shane seethed.I would never hurt her, Luke responded in kind.You already have, Shane took a step forward.So have you, Luke reminded, closing the gap between them.This isnt a pissing contest!Nick snapped, pushing the two men apart.He narrowed his eyes at Luke.You need to give her some time.Why dont you cool off and get something to eat with us?No, thank you, Luke growled.He backed up and sat down with his back against the wall, facing Lennys door.Nick sighed and grabbed Shane by the arm.Lets go.He pulled Shane toward the elevator but not before Shane gave Luke one final, threatening scowl.A heavy silence descended over Luke as he waited in the hallway.He rested his arms on his bent knees and leaned his head against the wall.This was the last thing he had expected.He had thought that she might be a little mad, maybe hurt.Mostly he was hoping she would be happy to see him.Hed come so far just to have the door slammed in his face.Twice.And why was Shane being all possessive?Were they back together?Luke rubbed the hot skin on his face where she had slapped him.He knew better than that.Lenny wasnt sleeping with Shane.It wasnt in her character.Of course, she probably had believed the same thing about him and look how he had treated that belief.The only thing that had been on his mind on his entire journey here was telling her he loved her.Instead, he had yelled at her and pushed her even further away.After Lenny had slammed the door she retreated to the bathroom.Her hand stung from where she had struck Lukes face.She looked at herself in the mirror and noticed the tears that were spilling down her cheeks.She wiped them away angrily and turned the shower on.The hot water poured down her back and Lenny gave way to heaving sobs.She leaned against the wall of the shower and cried.How could he be here?Why?What purpose did it serve for him to torture her up close?Couldnt he let her suffer from a distance?Everything about this was wrong.Completely and totally wrong.On one hand, she wanted to push him down a flight of stairs, along with the tramp from the photos.And on the otherall she wanted was to have him fold his perfect arms around her and believe that they could start over and none of that other stuff mattered.Lenny slammed her fists against the shower wall in frustration.She was still going to have to deal with this.Slapping his face and slamming the door were only minor interruptions in the fight they were in the middle of.It would take a lot more than that for this to get solved.But Lenny didnt want to.She wanted to go back to a few days ago, when the powder was perfect and Shelby Lynn had called her Snow Goddess.When she was so busy with living her life that her heart had, albeit briefly, stopped aching for a minute.How could the presence of one person completely turn her world upside down?She somehow managed to wash her hair and scrub herself clean.The tears abated for the moment and Lenny wrapped a towel around herself.She stealthily crept to the door and looked out the peep hole.Predictably, Luke was sitting just outside, facing her door.Lenny dug through the pile of clothes she had dumped out on the floor earlier for some sweats and a shirt.Nothing was particularly clean or attractive and she decided on a pair of gray, lumpy sweats and an old college sweatshirt that she had borrowed from Scott years ago.She slowly combed out her long, wet hair and thought about what to do next.She could let Luke in and the fight would probably start again.Maybe even causing them to get kicked out.Or she could go to bed and hope that hed get the hint and fly back to wherever he had come from.The last thought scared her more than the first.She didnt want him there but the idea of him leaving the way things were made her want to panic.She should go out there and talk to him.She knew it inside but it was difficult to figure out what to say.She had said everything she needed to when she had left the airport.Why did it feel like they were still connected?Shouldnt it be over?But no, she could feel him from the other side of the door, waiting for her.The rigorous workout that Lenny had subjected her body to hours before was catching up with her.So was the emotional stress of Lukes presence.Lenny curled into a ball on her bed and tried to focus on her breathing.The fatigue took over and she fell into a dreamless sleep.The others came back from dinner and a hush fell over the group as they stepped over Lukes rumpled form in the hallway.He didnt even look up at them.Nick ushered them to their rooms and told them to turn in early.
