She would be half naked again and obnoxious as hell.He paused outside the door and took a deep breath, bracing himself for the inevitable chatter that she would start hurling at him.He heard a stirring to his left and he frowned into the darkness.He made out a shadowy figure waving him over.Taking a few steps in that direction, he recognized Sway.Whats goin' on?He asked his shifty friend.Come with me.Sway waved him to be quiet and just follow.Luke shrugged and crept along the back of the venue in the dark with his bass player.As they made their way along, Luke could hear more whispers and they came around a corner to an ugly brown van and the rest of his band.The van was half hidden behind a dumpster but it looked like a throwback to their days when they were just starting out.Complete with the rust over the wheel wells and graffiti decorating the outside.The rest of the band members stood waiting for him in a semi circle.Luke was surprised at how relieved he was to see Lenny amongst his friends.Were ditching the buses tonight.Lenny hooked us up with a private ride.Harrison smiled eagerly, Youre coming with us.Luke looked around at the faces of his oldest friends and the girl he was falling for even more.How did he ever deserve to find not just one good friend in this world but five?He nodded and they all piled into the decrepit van.Luke noticed that Slim, their regular driver, was behind the wheel.He slid into the seat next to Lenny and whispered a question in her ear, If Slim is here, whos driving the Blue Bus?Lenny tried to hide her smile, Slims brother, Mo.Her eyes met Lukes and he squinted, trying to figure out if she was serious.Slims brother is namedMo?He asked slowly.Lenny bit her bottom lip to keep from laughing and nodded.Mike slid the door closed and settled into one of the captains chairs.Harrison occupied the other captains chair and Blake was sitting cozy next to Luke and Lenny.Sway took his position in shotgun and started calling out options for music to be played.Luke patted Lennys thigh affectionately and asked, This was what you were doing during the show, wasnt it?She nodded with a smile and he squeezed her leg.If she only knew the significance of what she had done, of what she did everyday...Dont worry, though, she whispered to him, Carl knows, this is completely sanctioned.Slim made his way out of the parking lot and onto the road before he turned on the headlights.I feel like super spies!Harrison whispered excitedly.Sway pushed an old tape into the ancient radio and cranked up the volume.As Tom Pettys 'American Girl' started to play, the whole band joined in, singing at the top of their lungs.As the van sped down the interstate, the band sang song after song together.Lenny felt the icky stench of Ashton evaporate and she smiled in satisfaction.This was the most liberated shed seen the guys all tour.That included when they were jumping off that bridge earlier in the day.This is exactly what it was like when we were young.Harrison reminisced happily.You guys traveled by van?Lenny asked, she loved to hear their old stories from before they made it big.Especially when Harrison told them.Yeah, in a crappy van just like this one, Harrison swiveled haphazardly towards Lenny.She laughed as he almost spilled onto the floor.He regained his balance on the loose bolts holding the seat down and continued.Our van was brown, too.We called it the Brown Streaker.We were very creative musicians back then.Lenny started with a small giggle but it grew into out of control belly laughter as Harrison kept going.I was getting puked on nightly, and we couldnt always afford showers at the truck stops so  Gross!Lenny cried.Who was puking on you?Harrison pointed his thumb over his shoulder, Usually Sways current shag.Hey!It wasnt my fault that they always seemed to have a lot to drink.Sway defended from the front.Sure, Harrison nodded in sarcastic agreement.But all we had was this one van, with all of our stuff and us in it.And Sway was always using it forextracurricular activities.Eww.Lenny scrunched up her nose.Tell me about it.Harrison shuddered at the memory, causing Lenny to laugh harder.Who drove?Lenny asked curiously.Not Blake!Mike said with force and Lenny waited for the explanation as Harrison put on his professor face.Blake does not drive.I drive just fine!Blake defended from the other side of Luke.Blakehow do I put thishit a building.Harrison stated flatly.One time!Blake interjected.He leaned over so Lenny could see the sincerity on his face.One time, Lenny!It wasnt my fault.Right, it was the buildings fault, how dare it be built where you wanted to drive.Harrison continued, just as flat.He raised his eyebrows at Lenny and she laughed even more.Oh, I forgot, not just any buildingthe courthouse.What?!Lenny exclaimed, How did you accidentally hit a courthouse, Blake Diedrich?!Her disappointed mother tone came out and all the guys laughed.I dont know!It was dark...I have night blindness...I thought I saw a dog His voice trailed off as he gave up defending himself.But at least he didnt set the van on fire.Harrison gestured to Luke.Lenny turned to him in shock.Why do you think I gave up smoking?Luke grinned.Wow, you guys.How did you ever get anywhere?Lenny was genuinely surprised.Oh, you know...hard work, good looks, Harrison ran his fingers through his hair, and of course were freaking talented out the ass.Of course, Lenny agreed but she was still laughing.She adored these guys, no one could replace them.She was past the point of no return; she couldnt see herself leaving them.Ever.The guys started to get tired after a few hours and eventually began nodding off.Lenny stayed awake, watching her fellas sleep.Ashton wasnt getting her claws into them.She leaned her head against the window and looked out at the stars.Luke shifted in his seat next to her and she glanced over to see him and Blake snuggled up together.She smiled, big, tough rock stars.Whatever power Ashton used to have over Luke was in no way stronger than the bond that this band shared.Lenny had to remind them of that.Ashton was simply a distraction, she didnt matter.Thats why Lenny had talked to Carl about renting the van and going ahead of the convoy.The guys needed to harken back to the days of their youth, where this whole crazy thing started.Two more shows before Denver, twelve total before Ashton left the tour.Then a four week break over Christmas.Lenny tried to focus on her job, but in the dark cabin with just the sound of the wheels on the road, her thoughts drifted to home.She wondered what she would do during break.She couldnt go home.She hadnt called her parents in over a week.The last phone call had been tense, they wanted her to come back.She missed them, but she needed to be out here more.She wasn't ready to face...all of that.Maybe Carl would give her some sort of assignment over break to keep her occupied.She could ask him later.Scott was pissed; shed stopped answering his calls two weeks ago.Her voice mail kept filling up.She wouldn't even check it if she wasn't afraid it would be Carl.Scott had been the most persistent of her family members.She wished he would just back off and let her figure this thing out.He didn't understand, none of them did.How could they?She wasn't exactly being the most forthcoming with any of them.Most of all, she was disappointed in herself.Lenny pinched the bridge of her nose and squinted against the headache revving itself into full blown migraine.Suddenly, Luke's arms were around her, pulling her against his chest and pressing his lips to her temple.The headache fled as she instinctively buried her face in his shirt.Sshh.It's okay, I got you.Luke whispered against her ear.Lenny ignored her previous logic of avoiding more situations like this.She needed him right now, it was that simple.And somehow...he just knew.Slim pulled over for breakfast at a little roadside diner.He opted to eat alone at the counter but the other six squeezed into a booth.They pushed each other playfully, taking up more space than they needed to.The waitress was not amused at their antics and she grumpily took their order and walked away.This was a great idea, Sway spoke for them all, We should get rid of the buses altogether and just travel like this again.He leaned his elbows on the table and started to play with the sugar packets.You feeling better, dude?Blake asked Luke who was sitting directly across from him.Yeah, Luke smiled, feeling like himself again.Sorry, I was acting so   Menstrual?Blake finished for him.Luke chuckled and nodded.Yeah, I guess thats how I was acting, huh?You guess?Dude, middle school girls are less moody than you, Blake grimaced.I dont know why you let your tampon get all twisted just because Ashton James, walking bitch fest that she is, happens to be around.What?Does she have your balls in a jar somewhere?Blake's dark eyebrows rose accusingly.They were giving him a hard time and Luke knew he deserved it.Its hard to think clearly around her, I guess I just shut everyone out.Sorry about that.Again.They took their time eating breakfast, enjoying the time together without any distractions.They were in such a good mood they even got their grumpy waitress to smile before they left.We have enough bunks in the Blue Bus for all of us, Luke looked around at the band, why dont we all just ride together?I like it, Mike looked to Lenny for approval.Hey, Im just the assistant.You dont need my permission.She held up her hands to show she wasnt protesting.I dont know man, Sway began, I really hate that girl.I don't want to sleep in the same vehicle as her.What if she tries to molest me?Gross, Sway.Gross.Lenny frowned in disgust and Luke smiled at how cute she looked when she was correcting Sway.Like she was still shocked by some of the things he said.But it might be fun to make her miserable, Blake pointed out.We could go on a shower strike like last time, Harrison suggested.Yes!Blake snapped his fingers and pointed at Harrison.That!Were doing it.Lenny closed her eyes and rubbed her forehead with her fingertips, Oh, geez.Sorry, mama.But we did promise you the full Rock Star experience, smelly guys and all, Sway grinned at her.We should definitely be as authentic as possible, Mike was nodding his head.You have to participate too, Lenny, Blake said, Youre one of us now.He arched an eyebrow, daring her.Luke was surprised when she took the bait and replied cheekily, I can hack it if you can.They pulled into the parking lot of their next venue and their spirits were high.As they made their way to the buses, Ashton came running out and grabbed Luke by the arms.Baby!Where have you been?I was so worried!She glared at Lenny over Lukes shoulder and Lenny rolled her eyes.It was weird, when Ashton called Luke, baby, Lenny didnt hear it as a term of endearment.It sounded more like piglets squealing at their mothers teat.Luke stepped around her, I was with my friends, I don't have to check in with you.She backed up at his curt reply.Ashton shook it off and ran to catch up to Luke, snaking her arm around his.Lenny had to give it to her; the girl was either very persistent or thick as a brick.Luke pulled his arm away and entered the bus, Ashton close on his heels.My coffee angel, Carl greeted Lenny as she handed him a cup of steaming coffee she had brought with her from the diner.I thought you might forget since the plans were a little different.I could never forget you, old man, she flashed a smiled.How did it go?Lenny asked, shed been slightly concerned for Carls safety once Ashton found out they had ditched her.I think she put a hex on me, Carl said honestly.That girl has issues, thats for sure, Lenny agreed.The guys have decided to all ride in the same bus until Ashton gets her own.Carl nodded his approval.And, theyve started a shower strike, she added slowly.Not that shit again, Carl sounded annoyed but his eyes held a hint of amusement, This is gonna get gross, you know.They made me agree to it, too.Lenny winced at her own confession and watched for his reaction.Carl burst out laughing, Ashton is gonna be so pissed.Sound check was amazing.The guys were presenting a united front and it greatly improved the mood of the crew.They weren't going to let Ashton get her way anymore.In fact, they were doing a pretty good job of humiliating her.She was constantly lurking about and it only provided more fuel to rip on her.Its like she couldnt take a hint.Why dont you go hang out with your minions?They like youat least thats what you pay them to do, Blake remarked as Ashton stood in the way of everyone.Shut up, Blake, she bit.No one likes you, youre just a washed up has been from the gutter.Blake's jaw worked under his skin and he growled back, Thats better than being a vapid whore with daddy issues.Who says you dont have daddy issues, orphan?Ashton's sneer was heard more than seen.I like your spray tan.What shade is that?Overcooked yam?The exchange of insults continued throughout the afternoon until Ashton threatened to call the Orphan Bus to reclaim Blake and he, in turn, threatened to set all of her undergarments on fire during her set.Harrison intervened at that point, and convinced everyone to separate for the remainder of the evening so they could concentrate on why they were really all there...for the fans.When Double Blind Study played their opening song, the crowd went nuts.The place erupted with the standard crowd surfers and slam dancers but they were fueled by a more intense energy than ever before.Lenny thought the roof was going to blow off, the fans yelled so loud.She was tempted to jump into the crowd and let them carry her away.Theyre on tonight.Greg shook his head as he tried to keep up with all the changes to the set list.The band pulled out some classics they hadnt played in a while.Fan favorites and B sides.It felt more like a jam session then a regular set.Lenny knew it was due to their impromptu road trip so they could reconnect to one another.Ashton's witchcraft be damned.It was day three of the shower embargo and Lenny felt her greasy hair with her fingertips.She made a face and brushed it into a tight bun on top of her head.She was really looking forward to that suite that Carl had promised her at the end of the week.The plan was working very well.Ashton was so mad she couldnt spit straight.She complained about the smell constantly and she stopped trying to get close to Luke.She kept making digs at Lenny about her trucker appearance, but Lenny always had a quick comeback that shut her up.For the most part.Lenny was alone in the bus, restocking and refilling the supplies.She was making a list on the counter when she felt the hair on the back of her neck stick up.She raised her eyes to see Ashton staring at her.She was wearing a little pink dress that could be mistaken for a negligee, her voluptuous breasts proudly on display.Dont forget to put soap on your list, she snarked.Good one, Lenny said flatly.Arent you embarrassed of yourself?Ashton looked her up and down, I mean, the grunge look is a little outdated.Lenny glanced down at her dirty jeans and stained t shirt.She wasnt feeling great about how she looked but she wouldnt give Ashton the satisfaction of knowing that.She shrugged and responded, At least no one has mistaken me for a hooker.Ashtons nose flared and her lips pursed together tightly.Sway skipped up the steps of the bus and into the room.Uh oh, do I smell tension?He waggled his eyebrows.No, thats Lennys ass, Ashton said haughtily.She started to wave her hand across her face and scrunched up her nose.Sway!You stink, too!Sway only laughed and got a water bottle out of the fridge.How was sound check?Lenny asked, blocking out Ashtons presence.Good.Solid.Sway thought for a minute and then asked Lenny, You wanna make out?Sway, you really would screw anything, wouldnt you?You have no standards.Ashton said with disgust.Thats not true.Sway said sweetly, pushing his long, stringy hair out of his face.I can honestly say that I have never wanted to bag you.Ashton sputtered something unintelligible and stomped outside.Sway laughed as she left then hugged Lenny to his side, I dont really wanna make out.I know.I mean, unless, you want to, he arched an eyebrow at her.Lenny pushed him away and rolled her eyes.Okay, okay.But let me know if you change your mind, he winked and left again.Lenny changed the sheets in the bunks and picked up the garbage that littered the floors.She considered not changing the sheets in Ashtons bunk but thought better of it.As she was pulling out the dirty, used blankets her notebook fell out onto the floor.Lenny slowly picked it up, remembering that Luke had been the last one to have it.Why was it in Ashtons bunk?Lenny paged through it and noticed some marks and notes had been made.She recognized Lukes handwriting but that still didnt explain why she found it where she did.She wasnt that upset about it.She wasnt thrilled but she figured Ashton was planning something devious and Lenny had caught her before she could pull it off.She tucked the notebook into a small cupboard behind the TV in the back lounge and checked the time.A half hour till Ashtons set.Lenny opted to leave her jacket despite the chilly fall air.She knew the arena would be hot with all the bodies jumping up and down.She jogged over to the stage area and took her seat next to Greg.The lights came down and the band started up.Ashton appeared on stage and began wooing the crowd with her haunting voice and complicated, nonsensical lyrics.Her set was the usual, nothing extraordinary, until her closing song.I wrote this when I was going through a tough time in my life.I finally feel comfortable sharing it with you tonight.Lenny gagged at Greg and he laughed.But as Ashtons delicate vocals drifted slowly and seductively over the air, Lenny got a sinking feeling in her stomach and goose bumps stood up on her arms.That bitch!Lenny said out loud.Greg frowned at her, confused.She stole my song!I wrote that!8    Lines In Sand      As soon as the encore finished, Luke threw his guitar to one of the nearby techs and hurried to the bus.He had to get to Lenny before she got to Ashton.During the entire set he struggled with focus as different scenarios flashed through his mind.Most of them ended with Ashton slapping Lenny with a restraining order and Lenny having to leave the tour.Luke couldn't let that happen.He had no idea what was in the future for them but he couldn't lose her.Not yet.The bus was empty.His heart started to beat with something akin to panic.He checked the other buses.Empty.The stage was getting broken down when he checked the sound booth.Where did Lenny go?Luke asked Greg who was closing down his equipment.I dont know, man, but she was pissed.Are you sure you want to find her?He called after Lukes retreating back.Luke was in a full out run, he hadnt seen Ashton or Lenny since the end of the show and he wasn't liking the disappearing act.He knew that Ashton had crossed the mother of all lines and she deserved whatever she was getting but Luke didn't want Lenny to have to deal with all that alone.Ashton would ruin everything if given the opportunity.She knew exactly what she was doing and it made him sick to his stomach.He ran back inside the venue and almost knocked over Carl.Have you seen Lenny?Luke panted.Yeah, shes in the office, he pointed to the door he had come from, I was just coming to find you.Have you seen Ashton?Luke shook his head dumbly and entered the small, dimly lit room.She was sitting in a chair at a desk talking on her cell phone and jotting down a few notes.She looked up at Luke and gave him a quick smile and went back to her conversation.Yep, well be in Denver tomorrow.great, see you then.She hung up the phone and turned her attention to Lukes worried expression.That was my lawyer, she explained, looking almost annoyed.Your lawyer?Luke was trying to follow along.His head swirled with confusion from adjusting to the drastic change in what he had expected to find and the reality sitting before him.Lenny frowned at him, Are you okay?Are you?Luke didnt understand why he had hadnt found Lenny with her fingers wrapped around Ashton's throat.Yeah, why?She smiled, Oh, because of Bitchy McThievery stealing my song?Luke nodded, watching her warily.His heartbeat thudding in his ears as he tried to calm down from the last few minutes of anxiety that he had experienced.Scott, always trying to protect me, she rolled her eyes, came across my journal awhile back and made me get a copyright...So, Im suing her.She ended with a wink.Luke closed his eyes and a low chuckle started that grew into full on belly laughter as he released the tension that had been building during the whole show.He reached over and grabbed Lennys hand and pulled her into a hug, still laughing.Whats so funny?Her voice was muffled against his shirt.Youre the best.He pulled her back and looked into her face.I was afraid you were going to kill her and I was going to have come and visit you in jail.It was Lennys turn to laugh, Believe me, I thought about it, but I decided this option would be way more satisfying.I'm not an idiot, I know what she's trying to do.I just won't play her game.He grinned and squeezed her against his chest again.Lenny pushed him away playfully, You stink!You should talk!Luke gave a hurt look but Lenny wasnt falling for it.Cmon, she moved to the doorway and looked at him over her shoulder, lets go hang out with other awesome people.Luke shook his head to himself in wonder.How did a woman like this come to be in his life?She was such a stark change from every other girl he'd ever dated or been around.When they entered the bus, Ashton was sitting in her usual perch on the couch with a smug smile on her face.The rest of the guys were clustered around the kitchenette, avoiding her entirely.Luke nodded to Harrison to pass him a couple of waters for him and Lenny.Um, Harrison questioned openly, shouldnt there be some sort of, I dont know, discussion?About what happened tonight?What do you mean?Luke decided to play dumb, wanting to know what Ashton had told the guys.Well, you took off after the set and Ashton told us just now that you guys wrote that last song together...Harrison trailed off, confusion all over his face.Are you writing songs with Ashton?Blake asked, more agitated and confrontational than Harrison.So that was how Ashton was playing it.She wasn't only trying to get rid of Lenny, she was trying to pull the guys away from him too.She really needed to revamp her diabolical planning skills.Actually, Lenny interrupted as she flopped herself onto the sofa right next to Ashton.I wrote that.She stole it from me.Luke held back a smile as he saw Ashton shift awkwardly.She obviously didn't expect Lenny's blas reaction.But, thank you, Ashton, Lenny's tone danced on the edge of sarcasm.You made it sound beautiful.She took a long drink from her water bottle as Ashton scowled at her.Just then, Ashtons cell phone rang.You might wanna get that, Lenny gestured.Ashton frowned at her and took her phone to the back of the bus.Lenny held up her hand, signaling the others to wait for it.WHAT?!Ashton shrieked.There it is, Lenny said, satisfied.I imagine that was her lawyer telling her the happy news that I'm suing the crap out of her.She held her bottle of water up in toast, Heres to a successful shower strike and copyright infringement!Shane: Scott texted me, he said that she's going to be in Denver tomorrow      Cody: no shit?Are you going to see her?Shane: I don't think that would be a good idea      Cody: I'll do it      Shane: let me know how it goes            Lenny sank deep into the bubbles in the over sized tub.She relaxed into the hot smell of jasmine and closed her eyes.The suite Carl had gotten for her was by far the greatest perk of her job that she had experienced yet.It was three separate rooms, a living room with a fireplace, an office area and a spacious bedroom with a King sized bed.The bathroom had an elevated round tub and a separate shower area.The first thing Lenny did when she got her room key was take a shower.While the shower strike had been highly successful in irritating Ashton and bringing the band closer together, Lenny silently vowed to never do that again.When she felt thoroughly cleansed of the 'on the road ick,' she filled the tub with bubbles and proceeded to soak her tired muscles.She planned on enjoying her last day of freedom as much as she could.She knew that calling her lawyer was going to open up a whole new sack of cats but teaching Ashton a lesson was totally worth it.Lenny heard a knock at her door and sighed.That was fast.She grabbed a towel and dried herself off and then wrapped the hotel provided robe around herself.She crossed her spacious living quarters as another knock sounded.She opened the door to find Carl, pacing, per his usual.Carl, what a surprise, Lenny said dryly.Carl smiled reluctantly and entered the suite as Lenny extended her arm signaling him to do so.He looked around, admiring her accommodations.How do you like your room?He asked too casually.I like it a lot.Whats up, Carl?She didn't want the small talk.She wanted to return to the bathtub and pretend she wasn't getting ready to have a crappy night.Before Carl could answer, someone else knocked on the door.Lenny opened it and found Harrison and Blake.They entered without being invited in.Nice digs, Blake whistled.He dropped into an over stuffed navy blue chair and swung his legs up over the arm rest.Hey, Carl.Harrison opened the in room fridge and started rummaging for snacks.Before the door to the hallway closed completely, Sway slipped inside.He kissed Lennys cheek on the way by, You smell nice, is that jasmine?He joined Harrison on the couch and turned on the giant plasma screen.What are you guys doing here?Lenny asked, trying to stay patient.Waiting for Mike and Luke.Sway answered like Lenny shouldve known.What?Why?She frowned and crossed her arms over her chest.'Cause were going out tonight.Harrison said matter of fact and then looked at Blake, Arent we?Blake rubbed the scruff on his face and nodded, Yeah, karaoke, right Carl?Lenny turned her attention to Carl who smiled sheepishly.You told me I could have the night off, Carl, her tone was more cross than she intended and Carl winced.Sway looked up and his eyes narrowed, What do you mean, night off?Were just hanging out.Geez, Lenny, is being our friend really work to you?His tone was lighthearted but Lenny could tell he was fishing.Lenny pursed her lips and swallowed, sidestepping that relational landmine and replied, I just meant that I have a meeting with my lawyer tonight.And I thought we could all use a rest.Sway seemed satisfied with her answer and went back to the TV.Lenny motioned for Carl to step aside so they could talk privately.Im meeting my lawyer in a couple of hours, I cant go to karaoke.Carl nodded his understanding, Okay.But I just wanted to let you know, Sway was right, this isnt part of the job.I thought you might wanna blow off some steam with us tonight.Youre going, too?Lenny frowned.Carl laughed quietly, Well, yeah.I get a day off too every once in a while, you know.Lenny conceded to that point but it still surprised her that Carl could so easily cross those lines of real friendship and professionalism so quickly when hed been on target the whole tour.Where you meeting the lawyer?Blake spoke up from his lounged position in the chair.Um, theres a fancy restaurant up the street, Lenny's stomach started to dive to the floor.Can we all eat together and then go out after youre finished talking to your rep?Lenny shifted uncomfortably.She didnt really want the guys around when her attorney brought down the hammer.The stuff with Ashton was simple, Lenny just had to sign some papers, but she knew there was going to be a more serious conversation after that.Her mind raced as she tried to think of an excuse to not have them there without having to tell them the whole story anyway.And she really didn't want to relive that nightmare.She resigned herself to Blakes suggestion, Yeah, thatll work.But its gonna take me a little while to get ready.Thats fine, well chill here.So much for my relaxing bath, Lenny thought.Carl, how come Lenny has a bigger room than us?Harrison asked.'Cause shes better than us, dummy.Blake answered, Harrison nodded like he agreed.Lenny shook her head and closed herself in her room to finish getting ready.As she was applying her mascara she heard Mike and Luke show up and Blake fill them in on the plan.Lenny shimmied into the little black dress she had purchased at the boutique across the street from the hotel.She hadnt packed anything to wear to a formal restaurant and needed something fast.The dress was modest in the front, it was snug but the hem reached her knee and the neckline draped gracefully across her collarbone.It was sleeveless with a beaded embellishment at the shoulders.She finished blow drying her hair and slipped into a pair of black platform stilettos.She applied a light coat of champagne colored lip gloss and took a deep breath.She hadnt been part of this world in a while and she wasnt sure how the guys would react, or if they would even recognize her.She glanced at the clock on the nightstand, time to find out.She opened the door and stepped into the living area, moving quickly to the door and pulling a knee length black coat out of the closet.She turned around to face the guys as she slipped her arms in the sleeves.The reaction was what she had dreaded.They gaped at her with open mouths and she felt heat move up her neck.Cmon, we have to go, she motioned for them to get up, not caring if she sounded impatient.Damn!Blake finally said something, You look he trailed off.Lets not make a thing out of this, okay?Lenny was cross, she clenched her jaw and led them out of the hotel room.Sway whistled, We are severely under dressed.You guys will be fine, Lenny sighed in exasperation, refusing to have eye contact with any of them on the elevator or their quick trip through the lobby.She couldn't handle seeing herself through their expressions.She had always hated this part of her life and she had tried her best to keep them out of it.As unrealistic as that might be.Its just a block north of here, Lenny was already walking down the sidewalk, as Luke tried to hail a cab, We can walk.In those shoes?Mike exclaimed.But she was already striding purposefully forward.The guys followed, she wasn't giving them the choice.Fueled by her frustration and irritation in the impending events, she barely noticed the disdainful looks given by the wait staff when they entered the restaurant.Miss Evans, we've been expecting you.The host greeted her, eying her group suspiciously.Theyre with me, Louise, she knew she sounded bitchy.She hated herself for it.He nodded reluctantly and motioned to a girl standing nearby.The girl proceeded to lead them to a table in a private room towards the back of the crowded restaurant.The room was empty except for a flurry of waiters rearranging the table and settings to accommodate the group they hadnt expected.The girl who had seated them took their drink orders and disappeared.The guys began to relax somewhat and the table buzzed with hushed conversation.Lenny sipped her water and sat perfectly still, staring at the center of the table in deep thought.This was never part of the plan.She hadnt just come from a family of athletes like she had told Luke.Both her father and mother were Olympic gold medalists, so was her brother Nathan.They were also incredibly wealthy, owning several high end restaurants and resorts all around the world.Including the one they were in.Brushing shoulders with the upper class of America had been part of her upbringing.Its one of the reasons snowboarding had appealed to her, it was the opposite of everything that surrounded her.But she could do it.She could put on the clothes and walk in the shoes and say all the words, but it literally felt like every cell in her body was screaming to run away.She focused on her breathing while she stared at the flickering candle in front of her.She felt eyes on her but didn't look up to see who they belonged to.Probably Luke.She could sense his concern from across the table.She hated that he was worried.She hated that it had to do with her.She had wanted to do this meeting privately but it wasn't feasible.Hopefully it would be over soon.As three men approached the table wearing very expensive suits, Lenny sighed.She should have known that Patrick would call her father.She stood up as he leaned in to kiss her cheek.Lenna, he addressed with a smile.Dad, Lenny acknowledged wearily, I didnt know you would be here.Who are your friends?Lennys father asked politely.The guys stood up to shake the mans hand as Lenny introduced them all by name.This is my father, Bruce Evans.She saw the realization dawn in each of their eyes as they greeted him and knew another piece of her anonymity was slipping away.The Bruce Evans?Harrison asked excitedly.Three gold medals and world record holder for the Mens 200m backstroke?Thats right, Bruce humbly smiled.Its an honor to meet you, sir.Harrison continued to gush, I had no idea you were Lennys father.Well, she looks more like her mother, Bruce's eyes crinkled on the sides as he smiled warmly at his daughter.Lenny's heart was stabbed with guilt at how wonderful he was treating her friends.Lenny introduced the second man, who was easily a younger version of the first, This is my brother, Scott.Scott Evans stood a great deal taller than most of the men around the table.His athletic build fit nicely into his tailored suit.His dark brown hair was a contrast from Lennys blonde, which he kept shaved nearly bald.He shook hands with everyone at the table and seated himself at the end.Lennys lawyer, Patrick, sat on the corner next to Scott with Lenny to his left.The rest of them took their seats with Lennys father sitting at the head, so he could best converse with all present.Lenny avoided speaking with her father and her brother.Instead, she focused on the papers her lawyer had already presented to her.Bruce entertained her friends by regaling them with tales from his youth.They were completely star struck.Food and drink flowed easily and Lenny was surprised at how effortlessly they got along with her father.They didnt exactly move in the same circles.Wait a second!Harrison looked at Lenny, shocked, Youre Lenny Freebird Evans?At Harrison's words, Lenny's mouth went dry.She took a drink of water and slowly put the glass back on the table, not really acknowledging Harrison's question.No way, Sway looked at Lenny as if meeting her for the first time.I remember you!Blake couldnt hide the awe in his voice, You could really fly.I dont do that stuff anymore.It was all she could think to say, her ears turning red with heat.Her father allowed a lengthy pause before speaking again.So, you are the group of ruffians my one and only daughter decided to run off with?Bruces tone was serious but his eyes sparkled with mischief.Maybe you can convince her to come home, Scott spoke up from his end of the table.Were in the middle of a tour, Scott.I have responsibilities, Lenny spoke to him sharply.Yes, you do, he leveled at her.She grimaced; she had walked right into that one.Speaking of, he gestured to Patrick, her lawyer, sitting next to her.The well dressed attorney picked up on his cue and explained to Lenny flatly, Youre in breach of contract with your sponsors.They are threatening to begin litigation.Lennys shoulders stiffened, Cant you just settle and give them some money?If they proceed, theyll try to clean you out.I dont care about the money, Lenny stated forcefully.Honey, her father addressed, and Lenny turned to him for the first time since they'd sat down.His face was filled with compassion for her and her heart stalled in her chest, Theyll take the Lodge.They cant do that!She was combative.Thats my home!Her voice cracked slightly.Thats Dukes home...Her hands started to shake and she gripped her napkin under the table.She looked to Scott for an explanation.Scott softened his expression, Why do you think Ive been trying to get a hold of you?Lenny stared hard into Scott's eyes, looking for some sign that this wasn't as bad as her gut was telling her it was.Honesty looked back.Her attempts to avoid having to deal with her mistakes had created a much bigger problem than she had anticipated.She let her shoulders drop, defeated.That was her one weak spot.The Lodge wasnt just her home.It was Dukes home too.She could always move on and buy a new house, but Duke had nowhere to go.Always the renegade, Duke refused to live in the public eye.Rumors swirled of him being too mentally deficient to understand what it meant to be paid for snowboarding.He denied sponsorship and remained relatively untamed, a mountain boy to the core.As such, he couldnt make a decent enough living to buy his own place and continue doing what he loved most.Big mountain riding.Lenny had purchased the Lodge years ago when the money had started rolling in.It was a massive estate like cabin in the mountains of Wyoming with five bedrooms, six bathrooms, multiple living areas and lounges.She had bought it with the intent of her and her friends being able to live there and snowboard the mountains right out the back door.Duke had been such an influential mentor to her, she made a deal with him.He could live there for free, forever, as long as he maintained the property.If she lost the Lodge, Duke would be homeless.And it would be her fault.She couldnt do that, Duke had done too much for her.He meant too much to her.What do I have to do?She asked, quietly submissive.Just make a few appearances until your contract runs out.You know, smile, wave and take pictures.Patrick explained it at all so simply.He had no idea how hard those things were actually going to be for her.The Winter X Games is the next one, its in January.Can I confirm to your sponsors that youll be there?Thats during break, Lenny, its completely fine, Carl tried to comfort her, misunderstanding the duress on face.Yes, Ill be there, she said, refusing to meet anyones eyes.She was humiliated that this had to happen so publicly for her.But this is how she had set herself up so she really shouldn't be surprised.Well all be there, Luke interjected earnestly.Lenny's head jerked up at his words.She tried to read his expression but was too distracted by her own messy thoughts to make sense of anything.Yeah, we'll be your assistants for a change, Mike said with a sly smile, backing up Luke like always.Just let me know how many will be in your party and Ill get rooms reserved at The Inn, Patrick said, diligently on duty.Lenny realized everyone was staring at her and she needed to snap out of her funk or there would be more questions.Questions she didn't have answers for yet.She couldn't start thinking about Aspen and who else would be there.She would have to deal with that later.Alone.She forced a smile and set about trying to make the meal more pleasant.She discussed business with Scott, told some stories of what life had been like so far on the road and reminisced with her father.As the evening progressed, more of Lennys life came into detail and was suddenly up for discussion.So, let me get this straight, Carl was really having a hard time believing that the Lenny, who had worked for him ardently for the past couple of months, had ditched on her own manager and brother, Scott.You just left town?You were supposed to be in a meeting and you just...got on a plane?Pretty much, Lenny laughed a little at Carls incredulous look.Whats the big deal, Carl?So she got on a plane, Harrison was attempting to defend Lenny by making it seem like her actions were insignificant, Its not like she took the talent bungee jumping or something.Carl blinked and did a double take at Harrison, Whywhy would you say that?Harrison shrugged, Ive had a lot of wine.Carl started to ask Harrison more but Blake interrupted, I think what Harrison is saying is that, Lennys still a responsible person.She just needed a change of scenery.Blake looked to Lenny for approval, And it worked out great for us; we ended up with the best assistant in the world.You guys went bungee jumping without me?Luke was catching on quicker than Carl but not as fast as he should have.Lenny covered her mouth with her hand to block her smile.She wondered how many secrets were going to all spill out tonight.Subtly wasn't really in the rock star repertoire.As they all stood on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant saying goodnight, Lennys father held her in a tight embrace.He kissed her forehead and looked at her lovingly, You have always made me proud.Lenny fought the lump rising in her throat at his affectionate display.Bruce Evans had never had a problem showing his daughter how much he cared about her, not even in public.Be good and call your mother, he hugged her a final time before getting into his waiting town car.Scott wrapped his strong arms around his sister and gave her a tight hug, You need to give Duke a call, too.He worries.No, he doesnt, Lenny scoffed.Yes, he doesand try to come home for Christmas.We miss you, too.Scott hugged her again before getting in the car with their father.Mike put his arm around Lenny and pulled her towards the hotel, Feel better, darlin'?Lenny only nodded.She really did.She wasnt exactly looking forward to bringing them to the X Games, she still had a lot of thoughts and issues to work through before they got there.But as she looked at her unconventional surrogate family she felt better knowing she wasnt going alone.Hopefully she'd find the strength to face her demons before then.9    Beautiful Disaster      Luke stood outside Lenny's room, his hand poised to knock.He just wanted to see her.She had looked great at dinner.Beautiful, but...sad.He felt the pull to her from the lobby and didn't resist it.He knew she would be alone.He knew she needed him.He knew this could all blow up in his face.He looked down at the guitar case in his hand and blew all the air out of his lungs as he knocked on the door.They finally had a break from the long, dragging hours on the bus and all he wanted was to be in the same room with her.Since Ashton had shown up, he'd felt like he'd hardly seen Lenny.He missed her.Hey, Luke didn't have more than that for a greeting.Lenny leaned against the door frame before smiling and standing aside to signal his entrance.She had changed out of her dress and her face was washed clean of makeup.Hair piled loosely on top of her head, she was in sweatpants and a white tank with a band hoodie half zipped over the top.She was breathtaking.Didn't you go with the guys?She asked as she closed the door behind him and then crossed the room and folded herself into an overstuffed navy chair.No, I wanted to see you.He sat opposite her on the couch and tried to look as relaxed as possible, placing the guitar case down on the floor next to him.Lenny was more subdued that usual.She sat quietly, not responding to his statement.Her pensive gaze was fixed on the sleeves of her jacket and her vulnerability was conspicuous.Big night.Luke hated how his voice sounded harsh in the quiet of the suite.Yeah, Lenny gave him a small smile and he saw that her attention had left her shirt sleeves and she was now watching him quietly.Her countenance hinting at the softness he knew lay inside her, buried deep for safekeeping.So, what happens with Ashton now?He asked, not wanting to talk about his ex but needing somewhere to start.She'll have to pay me some money and she'll probably stay away for a while.Lenny answered with a half smile on her face.Luke adored her half smile.What about this thing with your sponsors?How you feeling about that?Luke didn't miss the flicker of fear flash across her face; it was very uncharacteristic of her.Um, she looked back to her lap, it'll be weird, but I can't lose the Lodge.So...Her voice trailed off and Luke didn't miss the fact that she wouldn't look at him when she answered.Your brother is a beast.Luke tried to bring the conversation somewhere lighter.He needed her to be comfortable if he was going to go through with his original intention of seeing her.Yeah, he has that effect on people, Lenny laughed a little then and eased back in her chair.And your dad seems pretty cool, too, Luke added, trying to get a decent conversation flowing.He'd never been good with small talk.I probably give my family a harder time than they deserve.Her demeanor was shifting, ever so slightly back to confidence.The strange awkwardness that had been present a moment ago was dissipating and Luke internally high fived himself.I'm sorry I'm so weird about the snowboarding thing, Lenny suddenly blurted out.I haven't dealt with it very well, or at all, actually.She looked up at him sheepishly, I don't handle failure gracefully, if you hadn't noticed.Luke chuckled and leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees, You think we deal well with failure?I'm pretty sure that's just part of being human.He began to point to his fingers one at a time, Let me give you some of my favorite examples of how well we dealt with the failure of our last tour.Mike: started his own carpet laying business after he was clean and then refused to speak to me.Sway: got married to a stripper in Vegas and divorced within the week, twice.Harrison: tried to become a carpenter with disastrous, and might I add expensive, results.Blake: tried his hand at the culinary arts but mostly he gained twenty five pounds.It wasn't pretty.Lenny snickered at his examples, What about you?she asked, What did you do?Youve met my ex, right?Tall, brown hair, answers to Satan?Luke rolled his eyes at himself, Yeah, I bought her a house.Whoa!I didnt know that!No wonder she had a hard time moving on, you were her sugar daddy.Lenny teased, trying to stifle her laughter.As you can see, you dont have anything to be embarrassed about, Luke reassured her.Did you love her?Lenny asked, unexpectedly serious.Luke was taken aback, he had never thought about it.He shook his head, No, I just hated being alone and she was hot.Not my proudest moment.He paused as he thought about it, I didn't even like her back then.I think I bought her the house because I was hoping she would stay there, and away from me.What about you?He turned the question around, Have you ever dated someone you couldnt stand?A mixture of confusion and hurt swept across her face and Luke knew he'd touched a nerve.Her brows drew together and she licked her lips before answering.I really only ever had one boyfriend.I liked him a lot.Her voice grew quiet, I never got to know him enough to find out if I could love him.What happened?Luke tried to sound mellow.But he wasn't.The idea of another man in Lenny's life had him feeling on edge instantaneously.We broke up after the accident.Lenny was being dodgy and he could tell there was more she wasn't saying.That was kind of a dick move.Luke defended her.How could someone let a girl like this get away?Whoever it was, was an idiot.It wasnt...I'm the one who ended it.I broke up with him, her voice was strained and she was avoiding his eyes again.He shouldve fought for you, Luke argued.Her words weren't matching her demeanor and Luke was suddenly very angry at the guy who had obviously put a fracture in her heart.That's not really...Lenny shook her head and closed her eyes, It wasn't meant to be, that's all.After an uncomfortable pause Luke spoke again, needing to drive his point home.I wouldve fought for you.When Lenny looked at him, his heart about stopped in his chest.Her eyes were watery and her lips were parted, as if to say something into the silence.But nothing came.Her eyes sought an explanation, one she couldn't outright ask and Luke knew this was the moment.Very few times in Luke's life did he know exactly what step he was supposed to take.He usually guessed wrong and had to go back and try again.His past was filled with apologies, misunderstandings and broken fences that no one could mend.Not this time.Not with this moment.He unpacked his guitar and set it on his lap, his hands beginning to tremble.He grit his teeth.He needed to do this.It would be worse not to.He ached to hold her, to kiss her, to make her feel what he felt.He needed to have some sort of absolution to the dance they were in.He couldn't possibly be the only one feeling overpowered by his own heartbeat.Lenny, I haven't done the best job at showing you or telling you what you mean to me, he cleared his throat, But I communicate better through music so...He took a cleansing breath before he brought the pick to meet the strings in his chosen method of confession.You're not pushing but I'm falling  you're soaring and I'm stalling  and it's not a secret  that my strength is your weakness      the beauty you have inside  shines out through your eyes  you wear your heart on your sleeve  your wings flutter and you leave      and when you fly  can I be your blue sky  when your heart beats alone  let my arms be your home  if I say it first  will you say it second  if I give you this verse  will you feel protected      I need you  could you need me too...He waited for what felt like too many breaths before he sought her eyes.Did she understand the enormity of what his soul had admitted?Did she know that this wasn't some elaborate attempt to get in her pants but that he meant every freaking word?I do need you.Her voice came out rough and Luke stared at her mouth, wanting her to say it again.She licked her bottom lip and took a shaky breath.For the all the daydreaming that Luke had done about her and exactly how he would kiss her for the first time, he was suddenly very nervous.The first kiss with her could very well be the most important of his life.Luke put the guitar down and crossed the small space between them.He pulled Lenny to her feet and grabbed her around her waist with one arm, pressing her against him.With his other hand he cupped her neck and angled her face upwards.He looked from her eyes to her lips, hesitating for a fraction of a second.She didn't pull away.She didn't protest.His mouth came down against hers, feeling the firm softness of her lips as they returned his kiss.He thought that the taste of her would finally quench his desire, but it only fed his hunger for more.He had planned on kissing her slowly, taking his time, making it last.But when the moment came, he lost control.He lost himself in her.He felt her hands fist into his t shirt, pulling him closer.His heart raced as he realized his eagerness was being reciprocated.The intensity of their kiss grew as their weeks of self restraint were suddenly released in that one moment.Her hands worked their way into his hair and Luke let out a groan.They were yanked back into reality by the sudden knock at the door.They jumped apart as if they'd been shocked.Luke took a deep breath to steady himself.Lenny straightened her clothes and made her way to the door, checking the peep hole.She took one more calming breath before opening it.There you are, Carl smiled at Luke, The guys wanna know if you want to join us for a game of poker in Blakes room?He looked back and forth between Lenny and Luke, frowning.You guys werent fighting, were you?He asked, misreading the tension.Lenny smiled, No, just talking.Im actually pretty tired so Im going to get some sleep.But you should go, Luke, win some money back from Blake.Luke tried to read her face but she was as unreadable as ever.He nodded as he thought about it, Yeah, Ill be right down.Great!Carl turned to leave, See you in a bit.Goodnight, Lenny.Goodnight, Carl.The door closed and Lenny and Luke stared at each other in silence.Everything between them had changed in the span a few breaths.I dont want to go.Luke finally said, his soul screaming at him to say more.I know, but you have to, she whispered.Her cheeks were still pink from their momentary passionate embrace.She looked at him with clear eyes and Luke knew she wasn't asking him to leave because she didn't want this.It was because she wanted it as badly as he did.Luke charged across the room and crushed her to him.His hands started on her hips, making their way up to her hair as he kissed her desperately.She responded strongly, wanting him just as badly.He stepped back, breathless, her kiss making him dizzy.He held her face in his palm and touched her lips with his thumb.This is far from over, he whispered roughly.He left reluctantly, looking at Lenny one last time before closing the door.As he walked down the hall and to the elevators he tried to calm down.He had kissed lots of girls, more than he could count.But no one had knocked the wind out of him.No one made him feel like the earth had been slightly knocked off it's axis.He smiled to himself as the lift opened and he stepped inside.She had kissed him back.Luke stared at the ceiling.He had lost every hand in the poker game.He didnt care.He kept thinking about Lenny, alone in her room.He wanted to go to her, keep her company.Hold her.Kiss her.Explain the things that remained unexplainable without her around.I kissed Lenny.He said out loud to the ceiling.Mike was lying in the next bed and he propped himself up on his elbow and looked at Luke in the dark.Whaaat?He sounded like he was laughing but Luke couldnt see his face.When?Mike asked.Tonight.Before the game.Mike was definitely laughing.Where?On the mouth.Mike really laughed then, No, dude, where were you when you kissed her?Oh, in her room.Mike waited for more information then asked, Was it awesome?Yeah.Mike laid back down and chuckled again.Its about freakin' time, thats all I have to say.Luke smiled broadly.It also explains that stupid grin you had on your face the whole night.I lost a lot of money to Blake.Mike guffawed.Is it wrong?Am I screwing up all our lives?Don't be ridiculous, Mike chided.You two make the most sense of anything ever.You really think so?Luke felt his nerves settle into a bundle in the pit of his stomach.Oh yeah.Mike said confidently.She's your song.What do you mean?Every good lyric, melody or riff is Lenny in a package.Anyone can see it.You look at her and you just know...she's the one you've been singing about all this time.You just didn't know it.Luke felt his mouth tug up on the side in a smile.That's exactly why he told Mike stuff like this.For answers like that.Mike, dont tell the others yet.You know me; I always got your six, brother.Luke sighed contentedly.He knew they were moving in the right direction finally but he didnt want to go too fast and scare her away.This was a whole new ballgame.Lenny was all smiles when she woke the next morning.She had slept better last night than she had in years.She took a shower and dressed in jeans and a white t shirt with the black band hoodie.She literally skipped to Carl with his coffee.Youre awfully spunky today, he eyed her suspiciously.The healing power of sleeping in a real bed, Lenny joked.Well, that and finally having all those secrets come out last night lifted a weight off me.Carl nodded, Thats why honesty is always the best policy.A wave of guilt washed over Lenny and she changed the subject quickly.I better get the buses put back in order before we leave tomorrow.She was already hurrying off before Carl could ask any more questions.She had promised him that nothing would happen with any of the band members and something had definitely happened.She had a lot to do, moving Blake, Sway and Harrisons things back to the Red Bus, changing the sheets in the Blue Bus and restocking food.She was just finishing up in the Blue Bus when Luke appeared.They had eye contact and Lenny couldnt hide her excitement to see him.He grinned and rushed to her, kissing her face and lips passionately.He looked over his shoulder to see if anyone was coming.Satisfied they were alone for the time being, he let his fingers linger in her hair as he kissed her again and again.I missed these lips, he whispered between kisses.We have to keep this quiet, Luke.Lenny pulled away from his kisses and gave him a serious look.If Carl finds out, he'll fire me so fast.He gave her a lopsided grin, Hey, I totally got this.She rolled her eyes and he planted one more kiss on her lips before he really had to go.Someone would get suspicious if they werent careful.He walked to the door, turned and let his eyes rove over her face, unapologetic.He tapped the door frame with his fingertips like he had something important to say.Instead, he gave her a wink, Ill see you later.And he ducked out the door.Lenny grinned, she felt like a teenager.She knew she was behaving ridiculously but it was hard to stop.For the first time in a long time, she felt like she could breathe again.Cody bullied her way into the arena using a combination of flirting and threats.It always seemed a touch harder to get what she wanted than she thought it should be.You catch more flies with honey.Her grandfather's words echoed in her head and she rolled her eyes at the memory.Foolish old man.She spotted Lenny immediately despite the security giants trying to block her way.Her hair was longer and not in that god awful braid she had insisted on wearing since...well, since then.Lenny Effing Freebird Evans!Cody shouted at the top of her lungs, ignoring security as they tried to muscle her back out the door.Her voice echoed through the open space and she smirked with satisfaction when she saw that brilliant head of golden hair whip around in her direction.Lenny nodded to security and they let Cody through.She sauntered to the stage, taking careful note of Lenny's posture and body language.Cody wasn't sure if Lenny was happy to see her or not.She'd been pretty guarded since the wreck and even more reserved in the months leading up to her unexpected departure with a rock band.What the hell?You're in town and you weren't gonna call me?Cody smiled widely and ignored the fact that Lenny didn't smile in return.Scott called you?Lenny asked instead, slipping her hands into her back pockets and walking to the edge of the stage.This would be easier than Cody thought.The only reason she was here was to keep up appearances anyway.What kind of a best friend would she be if she didn't at least feign interest in Lenny's life?Besides, if she thought Scott was her source then maybe that meant she was thinking about coming back.Damn, girl.When you want to disappear, you do it in style.Cody didn't answer her question, the same as Lenny had done to her.She would play every game Lenny wanted to.She would just do it better.Cody hopped on the stage and hugged her oldest friend.Their relationship had always been complicated, but Cody had never found anyone who could truly replace Lenny.She was one of a kind.Perfect Lenny, with her perfect hair and her perfect teeth and her perfect life.She was so...perfect.Mike watched Lenny talking to her friend from his usual place behind the drums.Was it just him or did Lenny look a little stiff?He shifted on his stool and saw Sway texting out of the corner of his eye.Who you talking to?He asked.It wasn't any of his business and normally he could care less who Sway was talking to, but Mike was feeling curious today.A girl, Sway mumbled.You don't know her.Mike frowned.Sway didn't give his number out to girls.Weird.She a friend?Mike was actually pushing.He seriously didn't even want to know, he didn't know why he was asking.Yeah, dude, she's a friend.Why do you care?Sway looked up in exasperation.I don't, Mike rubbed his hand down his face and turned away.Whatever, man.I really wish you'd get over it.Mike glared at Sway whose head was bent back to his phone.He wanted to yell at him, curse him, tell him to shut up but he couldn't.Sway was right, Mike was acting paranoid.Again.Private conversations always set him on edge.He knew being on the road would make him jumpy after a while.The stress and the travel and all the crap that somehow goes along with it.Having Luke around helped.A lot.But being alone still sucked.And now that Luke and Lenny had finally kissed...kind of solidified his forsaken nature once again.Why did he care who Sway was talking to?Because he knew who he was hoping it was...But it wasn't.And it never would be again.Mike looked up to see Lenny approaching with her friend.He really didn't feel like meeting new people today but Lenny meant a lot to him so he'd attempt his best behavior.Fake it till you make it, right?This is my friend, Cody.Lenny introduced with a tight smile.Mike shook the girl's hand and ignored the once over he received.He wasn't interested.She seemed nice enough and being Lenny's friend, she probably was.Mike just wasn't that guy.Sway was overt in his praise of the new girl and Mike found himself backing away from the group ever so subtly.Lenny caught his eye and they exchanged what he could only describe as a painful look.She didn't want Cody there either.And she needed an ally.Mike sighed inwardly; he could be that for Lenny.It might give him something to focus on besides the turmoil.I'll stick around.Cody was nodding her head.Someone's got to fill you in on this chick, she elbowed Lenny in the ribs.I bet she hasn't told you any of the good stuff.Mike wondered where the hell Lenny had connected up with this girl.She was like the night to Lenny's day.And Lenny looked like she was going to lose her lunch.He looked around at the rest of the guys, why didn't they see whatever it was he was picking up on?Why did stuff like this always fall on him to fix?So what's the deal with you and the guys?Have you hooked up with any of them?Cody was trying to get Lenny to open up a bit more.She was being particularly cagey.Even for Lenny.They had covered the Ashton mess, Lenny coming to Aspen and life on the road.All that was left was Lenny's love life.Cody!Lenny exclaimed, looking around the sound booth nervously.No!I work for them and they're my friends.C'mon, Luke Casey has a bangin' bod.Totally doable.She saw Greg look over his shoulder at her and she winked.Please stop.Lenny was blushing uncontrollably at this point and Cody realized that nothing in that department had changed.Good to know.Frickin' virgin, Cody smirked.You have got to loosen up, babe.She took out her phone and tapped out a short text to Shane.For a guy who claimed he didn't care if Lenny had moved on, he definitely needed a lot of reassurance.Can we not talk about that?Lenny pinched the bridge of her nose and Cody wondered if maybe she was taking it too far.The headaches hadn't been an issue until after the accident but Cody always seemed to be trigger.Or maybe it was talk about sex in general that made Lenny's head hurt.Sure.Cody sighed.When are you coming home?It was the question of the year.When would Lenny return to the mountain and claim it as her own again?Cody found it hard to believe that Lenny could give it up altogether, not when she had so easily dominated.Maybe for Christmas.Lenny replied, relaxing again at the subject change.I saw Duke last week, he misses you.Cody swallowed the gag that wanted to surface.Those two had always had a much closer relationship than she cared for.She still didn't know why Duke had decided to mentor Lenny over his own niece but whatever.Cody didn't need anyone's help anyway.She'd proved that by winning the gold medal, hadn't she?The lights dropped and the show started and Cody felt relieved that the 'catching up' was over for the most part.Being with Lenny was exhausting.Trying to anticipate what may or may not upset her got old quick.Cody wished they could go back to being kids, when things weren't so complex.She would stick around after the show for a bit and fish for information.If Lenny had remembered anything surrounding the circumstances of the accident, it was sure to be obvious during a session of sentimental reminiscing.And she really wanted to know if Lenny was considering a comeback anytime soon.Lenny was doubled over in laughter.She couldnt breathe at all and sat down on the floor to try to catch her breath.But Cody wasnt going to let her off that easy.She kept going with her story, even as Lenny tried to wave a time out at her with her hands.So, Lenny, brilliant as she is, decides we need something edgy to do for the talent show.I went along with it because, well, lets face it, shes amazing and I trusted her.Lenny was wiping away her tears as Cody brought back some of her best memories.Pre accident memories.She convinces me that we should sing and dance to Salt N Pepas 'Shoop. 'She paused as the room exploded in laughter, then continued.No, seriously.We practiced for weeks, learning all the words and the dance routine.We were so proud of ourselves.She smiled at Lenny.Keep in mind, this was a private school that our parents paid thousands of dollars a year for us to attend.What happened?Harrison asked, wide eyed.We got kicked out.Cody said flatly.We didnt even make it through the first chorus and Mrs.K shut off the power.Lenny was finally catching her breath when Cody dove right in to another story from her past that she hadnt thought about in a long time.Maybe she shouldn't have dreaded seeing her friend after all.This could work.The guys had a lot of questions and Cody was more than happy to give detailed answers.She wasn't even a tiny bit surprised that there were five dudes drooling all over Lenny.It was typical.Lenny always had to have all the boys to herself.What about the nickname Freebird?Blake nodded a question at Cody.Where did that come from?You havent told them anything, have you?Cody accused Lenny playfully.Lenny shook her head but kept smiling.Another thing that hadn't changed from the accident, Lenny didn't talk about snowboarding.And the fake humility was a nice touch.Um, let me think, when did that start?She looked up at the ceiling as if trying to remember.We were in high school, Lenny was starting to gain some attention for her talent on the mountain.She sat next to her friend on the floor and leaned her back against the wall.Lenny was always taking off to go test the powder in remote areas of the world.The boys at school loved her and were always trying to get with her.Lenny shook her head to disagree, embarrassment starting to color her neck.Yes, Sweetie, youve always been hot.Cody dismissed her silent argument and sighed, But Lenny couldnt be tamed, just like the song.I think the first time it was used publicly though it was Shane Brookings, was it not?She looked to Lenny for verification.Lenny bit the inside of her cheek and shrugged.Cody chose her next words carefully.Yeah, it was.Shane was doing an interview with ESPN and they asked who he thought had the most potential in the young crowd that was staring to blaze their trail on the mountain.And he said, Lenny Freebird Evans, that girl can fly.Thats a pretty hefty endorsement.Isnt that guy like, the best?Mike asked.Cody narrowed her eyes at him.He had been paying way to close attention and she didn't trust him.She forced a laugh in response, Yeah, he basically rules the effing sport.Lenny was quiet; she was still smiling but had calmed down considerably.Cody watched heedfully, looking for any telltale signs of grief, heartache, regret, etc.But Lenny was an oak.And it stuck; announcers and commentators started talking about this amazing new talent and they hardly used her first name anymore.Why did you say publicly?Was it used before that?Luke asked.Cody calculated his question.She knew men and she knew them well.And it was more than obvious to her that Luke not only wanted Lenny but he also wanted to protect her.How in the hell does she always make that happen?Hottest guy in the room and he's her frickin' lap dog.I started calling her that in high school every time she turned down another poor boy that had fallen desperately in love with her.I had mentioned it to Shane the first time we met him.Remember that?She elbowed Lenny.He kept trying to flirt with Lenny but she wasnt having it.So I explained that she was a free bird and she wasnt gonna be caged.She smiled at Lenny with mischief.Shane liked it so much he got a tattoo of it on his bicep.Luke might as well know the truth.If he's going to be her whipping boy he should know he's not the only one.Whoa!Some dude got your name tattooed on his arm for you?Sway gaped.
