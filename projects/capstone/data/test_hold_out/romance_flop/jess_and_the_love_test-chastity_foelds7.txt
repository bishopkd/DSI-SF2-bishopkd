I just wanted to spruce things up.Remember when you used to buy me flowers?Yeah.That was before we were married.Husbands dont bring their wives flowers.Anthony sniffed at the air.Aha!The trigger!Do I smell cherry pie?Oh, so NOT the trigger!You do, Jess replied, getting up.She knew that was his way of telling her to bring him some cherry pie.That hypno circuit board was a hoax.Or maybe he hasnt been listening to the radio.Was the pool guy here today?Anthony asked.Yes, why?Jess nervously replied.She laid the cherry pie on the table and proceeded to cut Anthony a slice.Her hands shook.Anthony grabbed her wrist.He comes here a lot, Anthony said.So?Jess whispered.Anthony pulled on Jesss arm and spun her so that she landed on his lap.SO, he should get the job right on the first try.Hed never make it working for me.His thick hand grabbed the back of Jesss neck, and he twisted her head toward his.He knows!He knows I want Manolo!But he didnt.Anthony settled his lips on Jesss, and he gave her a kiss like the ones he used to give her before they were married long, and soulful.When his lips released her, Jess said, Mmm.What was that for?Anthony shrugged and smiled.I dont need an excuse to kiss my woman, do I?Jess used a fork and broke off the tip of the slice of cherry pie, and then fed it to her husband.No you dont, she said.Never.6   Jess cleaned up in the kitchen with a spring in her step.Despite his past infidelities, Jess was tickled pink that Anthony had kissed her.It took so little to make her happy, it was a wonder Anthony couldnt manage it without a hypnotic push in the right direction.Anthony was watching baseball in the den by the time Jess was done cleaning up.She sat and watched with him for a while, but things were no different than before.He barely noticed her, and only spoke to her when he needed another beer.I should have put lilacs in the den, too.By the time the eighth inning started, Jess was ready for bed.She went upstairs, lit the three lilac candles shed purchased that day, and changed into a red satin nightie.This will turn his head.It didnt.When Jess went down to the den to tell Anthony she was going to bed, he merely grunted, and gave her a cursory once over.Jess had hoped the nightie would lure him upstairs before the game was over, but she now knew that was too much to ask.Jess had fallen asleep by the time Anthony came upstairs, but like hundreds of other nights, she woke up when he entered the room.He blew out the candles, muttering something about having to tell her not to leave them burning in the future, brushed his teeth, and took off his clothes.The bed listed when he climbed on.When Anthony put his meaty paw on Jesss shoulder, she thought, here we go again.But he didnt flip her onto her belly like he always did.Anthony eased her gently onto her back, and pressed his lips to her throat.Mmmm, Jess said sleepily.Anthony ran a strong hand, a hand that pummeled people on a daily basis, across her cheek.His touch was gentle.He pressed his lips to hers with an urgency that was a distant memory.Jess kissed her husband back, keeping her eyes closed, and suspecting it was half a dream.His tongue probed her lips, and then sought entry there.Jess opened her mouth slightly, and Anthonys tongue, tasting minty fresh, ran across her teeth.Oh, if this is a dawn of a new era, then sign me up!As Anthonys hand ran along Jesss side, her back arched, and her body reached out for him.She cradled his head in her hands, and Anthony peppered her lips with dozens of tender pecks.He eased his body on top of hers, and Jess spread her legs for him.Anthony kissed the tops of her breasts as his hand stroked between her legs.When he finally entered her, Jess was completely ready for him, and welcomed him wholeheartedly.He continued to kiss her as they made gentle love, and for the first time in their marriage, Jess arrived at the station before he did.It was marvelous.But Anthony wasnt done there.After theyd come apart, at the moment when Anthony would usually roll over and go to sleep, he slid down her body and lifted her nightie so that he could kiss her tummy.Jesss body rolled to and fro on the king size mattress as his lips danced around her belly button.Ive never been so fond of the scent of lilacs!Anthonys mouth continued working south, and he did something he had once told her he would never do.Hungrily, eagerly, and without reservation, his mouth brought her back to the station once more, and Jess thought she was having the most marvelous dream.
