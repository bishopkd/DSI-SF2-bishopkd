Jess placed the silver serving bowl heaped high with pasta and seafood in front of her husband.He dug in heartily.Apparently tuning people up built an appetite.Jess picked carefully at her dinner, minimizing the pasta and focusing on the seafood.As she crested towards forty, carbs were not her friend.What do you think about renting a movie tonight?Your pick, Jess said.She knew that would doom her to explosions and car chases, and not the character driven films that she enjoyed, but one made sacrifices in a relationship.No.Going out, Anthony said.Business.He took half the loaf of Italian bread and slathered it with soft butter.For as long as theyd been married, he could eat like a teenager and not put on any fat.Only muscle.Lots of muscle.Really?Jess asked.On a Wednesday?Yep.Cant be avoided.Jess was left to clear the table and do the dishes while Anthony showered and put on a good suit.He didnt kiss her goodbye.Where have the kisses gone in their marriage?Surely there is nothing wrong with using a little hypnotism to bring back the kisses.But why did it feel wrong?Even when Anthony came home, at past two in the morning, he didnt kiss Jess.She pretended to be asleep while Anthony pulled off his tie and hung up his suit.The bed listed heavily in his direction when he climbed in beside Jess.The cool night air rode up inside her flannel nightshirt as he billowed out the sheets and made himself comfortable.Anthonys meaty hand swallowed Jesss flannel covered shoulder as he leaned forward.Ah, a kiss.What was I worried about?This is a nice change.See, I just should have been patient.Ill tell Isabella to disconnect the subliminal circuit board.Only it wasnt a kiss.Anthony rolled Jess onto her belly, and he climbed on top of her.Anthony yanked up her flannel nightshirt and pushed her knees apart.For all he knew, she was still asleep.Jess stared at the pillowcase blankly, well used to the routine.We need new linens.And maybe a new color of paint on these walls.No kisses.Jess didnt even get a peck on the cheek, or the back of her neckAnthony just entered her, without any foreplay or tenderness.Jess just lay there, patiently.She knew from experience that she would moisten up quickly, and it wouldnt hurt for long.Anthony was a long time coming, just like when it wasnt his first time in a night.Anthonys breath smelled of liquor, and the faint scent drifted of something.Maybe the liquor is slowing him down.He usually finishes pretty quickly.Jess stared at the headboard while Anthony pounded into her.She gritted her teeth.He was big, her husband, and strong.There was no use resisting, and certainly nothing to be attained by saying no, not tonight.Jess just waited for him to finish.What was that smell?Anthony wheezed and grunted as he went about his business.It began to hurt less and less, which was good.Of course, if history was any indication, by the time Jess started enjoying it Anthony would be done, and she would be left to her own devices.Hes my husband.Its my duty.Jess could pick out his musk that wasnt the smell.It was flowery.LikeJasmine.Oh my God!That was another womans perfume.Son of a bitch!Jess squeezed the pillow with her fingers.Yeah, thats right, Anthony muttered drunkenly.Yeah.You cheating stinker.After all Ive done for you!Anthony released himself into Jesss angry body, and then he rolled over and went to sleep.Any doubts as to whether or not Jess should use the subliminal programming became a far, distant memory.4   Two weeks later, Jess checked her toenail polish for scuffs as she fastened the straps on her cork wedge sandals.She wore a button down blouse that revealed a healthy amount of cleavage, for her, and a flouncy print skirt.Her waxed legs were tan from the sun and soft with aloe lotion.Her hair was pulled back.Jess had spent thirty minutes on her makeup.
