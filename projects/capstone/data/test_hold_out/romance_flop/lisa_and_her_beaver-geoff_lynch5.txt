The thought crossed my mind, but never really seemed interested in other women.Makes sense now, but back then I thought he just liked woodworking.Oh he liked working wood alright, just not the kind you were thinking about, Candye laughed.Shut up baby eater, Anne said.Lisa looked at her mother funny and asked, Baby eater?What are you talking about?Oh our friend here is here for eating her baby, sick bitch.Seriously?Thats fucked up, and whats with the diaper?Lisa asked.She pissed herself and said her water broke, was going to have the baby she ate.Lisa shook her head in disbelief, What people will say these days.What about you?Anne asked.I heard you were out taking naked pictures in the woods with some photographer.Yeah, not anymore, Ive been out hanging with a beaver, Lisa replied.A beaver or your beaver?Anne asked.A beaver, named Toby.You went to the pet store and bought a beaver?Anne asked.No, he owns his own place, has a college degree, oh no, he said he dropped out, anyway, me and him have been hanging ever since I got caught by those hillbillies.Do I want to hear this?Anne asked.Ill explain later, but I do want to say I dig this jumpsuit they gave me, I was tired of being naked all the time, Lisa said.So why are you here?Anne asked.Indecent exposure, Lisa replied.It was the hillbillies.You weren't taking naked pictures in front of a school were you?Anne asked.No mother, we were out in the country, we were captured and they took all my clothes, Ive been running around naked ever since.Wheres your friend?The perv with the camera?Last I knew he was jerking off into a cup in the basement of the house they were keeping us in.I escaped and never looked back.I found Toby and the rest is history.And you think my story is fucked up?Candye said.A beaver who's a college dropout?Give me a fucking break.Its true, I have no reason to lie, Lisa said.Where is your friend Toby now?Candye asked with a sardonic grin.I had to leave him with a witch so I could get home.Leave him?I dont want to talk about it, Lisa said with a tear welling up in her eye.By now Toby was dead and the witch was using his tail to cast a spell for ultimate power.You have plenty of time, none of us are going anywhere soon, Candye said.How did your court turn out?Anne asked Candye.Candye hesitated to reply, then said, Bunch of fucking bullshit if you ask me.Go on, do tell, Anne said.The public defender is a prick, I dont think he said two words to me, he talked to the judge like he knew me or something.Every time I tried to speak up and defend myself, he told me to sit the fuck down and shut my face.What were you doing that made him do that?Anne asked.The other lawyer kept calling me a fucking psycho nut case, I took offense to that, Im no nutcase, and Im the smartest person in that room.Two college educated lawyers and a judge are dumber than you?Anne asked.Thats book smarts, I have real life smarts, Candye replied.I know more about life than all three of them combined, and told them as much.So what happened?Fucking judge gave me contempt of court, said I had to serve three more days and pay a five hundred dollar fine.I told him to stop molesting kids.I bet that helped your case, Anne said.Fuck him, and fuck you bitch, Candye said.You really dont know how to interact in social situations do you.Anne said.You have a lawyer for a reason, use them, dumb ass.Oh, you didnt hear the best part, they had three guards jump my ass, Candye said with a smile.Took three of those bastards to cuff me.See whos tough now?Why did they do that?After the judge gave me the fine, I took off running towards the bench.I got to this gavel and through it at him, missed the fucker.Is that why you're cuffed to that pole?Anne asked.Maybe, I dont know, Candye replied.They didnt say much to me after they hauled me back here.I know, I was here, trying to sleep, Anne said.When do you go back to court?Who knows?Candye said shaking her head in disgust.I dont plan on seeing the outside for a long long time anyway.Lisa spoke up, Mom, what are they going to do with you?Probably a hearing, then a trial, then the chair, Im supposed to meet with my lawyer today sometime.Ill find out then.Can you plead self defense?Lisa asked.No, I shot him because he lied and cheated on me, I knew what I was doing, Anne replied.So I suppose insanity isnt an option,  Nope, I knew where the gun was and I used it, Anne said.You act like you're proud of yourself.I am, for once I took charge and didnt let someone fuck me over.Ive never said once I didnt do this and if it happened again, Id shoot that fucker again.Thats my dad youre talking about, Lisa said.I know, Im sorry honey that it turned out like this.Maybe if you had told me years ago I could have divorced the fucker and lived a normal life, Anne said.Youre blaming me?Lisa asked.In part yes, you could have told me and this never would have happened.Thats a pretty big load to dump on me mom, Im not to blame for what dad was doing, Lisa snapped back.But you are responsible for not telling me what you knew.Lisa stepped away from her mother and sat down on the cold hard aluminum bench.She was quiet and stared blankly at the floor.Dont get all sentimental now Lisa, dont act like your dad was a good man, I dont think he loved me, or you or Trish for that matter.Did he ever come to your school events?Did he ever make time for anyone but himself?He whored me out at the diner so he could pay for men to have sex with, come on Lisa, dont act like Im the bad guy here.Were all to blame, Lisa said.But now hes dead and there is no going back.Candye spoke up, I have to pee, can one of you call a jailor?Use the diaper, Anne said, They put it on for a reason.Yeah, if I tried to piss on the floor, but Im telling you I have to go to the bathroom, I dont want to piss on the floor.Please call someone.Anne stepped over to the bars and yelled, Hey, we need someone down here!Did they hear you?Candye asked.How should I know?I feel it coming, I cant wait much longer, Candye said crossing her legs and bouncing up and down.Quit bouncing, that cant help, Anne said.Oh fuck, Candye said, Too late, and the piss ran into her diaper and spread across her jail jumpsuit and down to the floor by her feet.Those diapers dont work very well, Anne said.Lisa looked up and Candye and replied, They are designed to be worn under the clothes, not on top, thats why shes peeing on the floor.Dumbass guards dont know how to put a diaper on.Then a booming voice from outside the jail cell.My guards arent wet nurses, theyre trained jailors, diapers aren't our thing.said the police chief.Looks like I need to get you a mop again.If you treated us like human beings instead of animals this wouldn't happen, who puts a diaper on a grown woman and cuffs her to a pipe?What do you expect?Shes nowhere near the toilet, Anne said.Whats done is done, Ill get a custodian and a new uniform, dont you worry your pretty little head now missy, the chief said.Anne shook her head at the chief and didnt reply, her snarky look was enough to get her point across.The police chief remained stone faced, but she was pretty sure she got through to him, especially after throwing in an eye roll when she was done.She almost expected to feel the chief grab her by the throat and beat her head against the bars, but no, he walked away not saying a word.18   47 Ford      Judd walked back to the gas station and entered the front door.Standing at the counter was the same women he met two days before, it was Bernice.She didnt bother to look up when the ding sounded from the door chime, it was like she was deaf.Judd admired the retro look of the place with old pin up pictures on the wall and a stack of 1950s oil cans stacked on display.Do you still have my cell phone?Judd asked looking down at Bernice.She looked up from her crossword puzzle book and looked Judd in the eye.Its still plugged in behind the counter, you can come around and get it.Judd walked around the counter and unplugged his phone.He wrapped the cord and stuck it in his pocket.You rent cars right?he asked.Yes, she replied.What I really need is a ride back to Sparksville, I cant return the car once I get there, is there anyone here that could give me a ride?Id pay for their time and gas.Bernice didnt hesitate, she picked up the phone and called to the back, Send Rachelle out, she said and hung up the phone.Judd waited patiently for this Rachelle to appear and when he did he was shocked and amazed.She was a tall, leggy, teenage girl with long brown hair wearing a mini skirt and heels.She looked like she had walked out of a porn magazine.Rachelle, this guy needs a ride to Sparksville, get the pick up and take him please, Bernice said.Rachelle made a face like she was just asked to do the dishes, it was obvious she didnt want to play cab driver.Dont worry about her, shes a real bitch, a lazy bitch.Shes my granddaughter, love her to death, but she spends all her time on her phone chatting with boys.Judd felt his pants bulge and was glad Bernice couldn't see over the counter.What happened to the lady that kidnapped me?Judd asked passing time.In the freezer, Bernice said.What?Judd asked.Cops came, I told them she took off.Sounded plausible since she had a dead body crammed into her trunk.What are you going to do with the body?Judd asked.Supper tonight, she replied.Youre ride is ready, she said pointing out the window.Rachelle was driving the truck to the front door.How much for the ride?Judd asked.Free, you brought us supper, I think its a fair trade.Awesome, Judd said turning to the front door.Whatever you do, dont try anything with Rachelle, Im not saying that to protect her, Im saying that to protect you, Bernice said looking at the obvious boner sticking his pants out.Judd got in the passengers seat of a 1947 Ford pickup truck.In the drivers seat was Rachelle who had just put on a darker shade of lipstick.She looked like a pinup model from head to painted toe nails.Did grandma tell you not to try to fuck me?Rachelle asked.Something like that, Judd replied.Old bat, I never have any fun with her around.Shes not around now, Judd said hoping for a clear message that it was alright to try to get up her skirt.I dont fuck just anyone you know, I have standards, she said driving off onto the highway.Im sure you do, we all do, Judd said.I dont like guys that try too hard, looks pathetic.I also dont like guys who are shorter than me.That must be tough, how tall are you?Six foot?Judd asked.Six two, Rachelle replied.That dont leave a lot of men, Judd said.Im six three, he added to make sure she knew he qualified.Do you smoke?she asked.Hoping to get the answer she wanted, he replied, No, but sometimes if Im at a party...I hate smokers, smell like shit, brown teeth, gross, Id never fuck a smoker, she said.Like I said, I dont smoke, Judd said.You do at parties, why is that?Who are you trying to impress?Rachelle asked.Judd watched the road fly by and tried to come up with a good lie.I was trying to fit in, he said looking for some sympathy.Why do you wear the clothes you wear?he asked.Are you some sort of rapist?Going to claim I made you rape me because of what Im wearing?No, not at all, Im making a point that we all want to fit in, if you didnt you could be wearing a potato sack instead of a skirt and bear skins instead of that shirt.Dont pin me into some group of crazies, you do the same thing, Judd snapped back pissed, now he knew he wasnt getting laid.What I wear is none of your business, Rachelle stated as a matter of fact.What I do at parties is my business, Judd replied in the same tone.For a while both were silent as they headed towards Sparksville.It was an awkward tense quiet.Are you a vampire?Judd asked.Yes, Rachelle replied.Nothing else, she kept her eyes glued to the road.Whats that like?It is what it is.How old are you?You look sixteen, Judd asked.If I look sixteen, why are you gawking at me like you want to fuck the shit out of me?Can you answer my question without all the drama?Im two hundred and forty eight years old, she replied.Old enough to know when Im being toyed with by a creep.How much further till Sparksville?Judd asked pissed.Sixty miles, Rachelle replied.Maybe Ill take a nap, Judd said leaning back in his seat.Avoid me all you want, your still a creep.Look bitch, you dont know me.I know your type, Rachelle replied.My type?Now youre stereotyping me?Well, I know your type too, Judd replied.Rachelle began to laugh, Really, tell me mister, what is my type?Youre a cock tease, looking for attention and getting pissed off when you dont get it.Surprised you havent been raped yet.What makes you think I havent been?I was right, told you so, Judd said.Just then Judd heard a sound from the bed of the truck, it was the rustling of metal on metal.What do you have back there?Judd asked.He turned to see Sam in the back holding a steel pipe ready to bash in the back window.Holy shit, watch out!Judd said as the pipe crashed through the rear window sending glass all over the cab.Rachelle grabbed the pipe and pulled hard with her super vampire strength.She managed to pull the pipe loose and set it on the floor.Take the wheel, she said and put Judds hand on the steering wheel.She then rolled down her window and crawled out.With a quick leap, she was in the back of the truck face to face with Sam.Judd moved over to the drivers seat and took over control of the truck.The first thing he thought to do was slow down and pull over, but he didnt know how to work the gears and didnt want to cause the truck to crash.He had to keep it a sixty miles an hour till Rachelle came back.In the rear, Rachelle stood tall waiting for Sam to attack again, this time Sam had a metal chain that she swung around like her lasso ready to strike.Round and round the chain spun until Rachelle grabbed hold and pulled the chain and Sam towards her flinging her off the truck onto the highway.Rachelle watched Sam flip and flop and come to a rest as the distance between them increased.Stupid bitch, Rachelle said and got back in the truck, this time in the passengers side.You killed her!Judd said.It was self defense, Rachelle replied.No, Im pissed I didnt get too, Im jealous.You knew her?Yeah, she kidnapped me and raped me, and tried to get me to feed her hogs, Judd replied.A woman raped you?Thats a joke, Rachelle said.Im not a bad looking man, Judd replied, Some women find me attractive,  That thing may have been a woman, but she was no better than her hogs from what I saw, Rachelle said.Shut the fuck up, I may have hated her for what she did, but at least she thought I was attractive enough to do it too.That woman probably has twenty vibrators in her bed drawer and an industrial size package of batteries.She would fuck any man that she could, dont impress yourself.Ive had enough of your put downs, now are you going to leave her body back there?Thats leaving the scene of an accident, Judd said.I dont care.Why dont you care?So what do you do in Sparksville?Rachelle asked.Im a writer and photographer at the paper, Judd replied.Really?Have you met anyone famous?Not nationally, I did cover the election last year and met the vice president when he was campaigning.No, I mean like movie stars, or singers.Just locals, Judd replied.What kinds of stories do you write?Local news, food drives, accidents, stuff like that, Judd replied.That sound hideously dull, Rachelle said.It helps pay my bills, Judd said.You have a second job?I do portrait photography on the side, I was doing a shoot when I was kidnapped.Sounds interesting,  It was, I was about to do a full nude shoot for this hot girl when these two hillbillies kidnapped us.Did you try to fuck her?Rachelle asked.No, I didnt, but the hillbillies wanted too.Did they?I dont think so, but they might have.How did you escape?Rachelle asked.The girl got away and they didnt want to leave me behind so they tied me up and put me in the car.Then we got pulled over for having that dead body crammed into the trunk and here I am.I see, do you want to fuck now?Rachelle asked.Why now?Judd asked.You were dull before, now I find you interesting and that turns me on.I dont know now, you look sixteen, but youre over two hundred, youre hot and gross at the same time.And you just killed Sam which is sort of a turn off.You got one chance, if you want me Ill pull over onto a gravel road and let you have your way with me while Im still interested.How long do I have to decide?Judd asked.Ill give you ten minutes, and each minute you make me wait, the less I want you inside me.Fine, pull over, Judd said.19   3 Months later      Anne stood before the court at her sentencing hearing, she had plead no contest to second degree murder and was now ready to hear her fate.She stood alone, as she was her own defender, the judge looked down upon her.In the case of the state versus Anne Marie, the court has found you guilty on two counts of second degree murder, both charges carry a maximum sentence of forty years to life without parole.It is this court's decision that you serve two forty year sentences consecutively with no parole, at the Sparksville correctional facility.This sentence is to take effect immediately.Sitting in the gallery was Judd, now working in the capacity of a reporter/photographer.In the front row was his former model and Annes daughter Lisa who was in tears.The bailiff and his staff escorted Anne out of the courtroom and into the hall to the waiting police van parked outside.The galley cleared and Judd made a point to run into his former model Lisa who he hadnt spoken to since the kidnapping.Hi, he said as if it were yesterday.Sorry to hear about your mom.Are you writing for the paper?Lisa asked.Yeah, Im assigned to court cases.What are you going to say about my mother?Lisa asked.Just the facts, what else would I write?Judd asked.Ive read the articles in the paper, and the editorials, your paper is a piece of shit!Judd waited a second before he replied.I didnt write those articles, and Im not an editor, I only cover what happens in the court room.Same thing, youre all fuckers, Lisa said looking like she wanted to lash out.Are you interviewing me now?Is this conversation going in that rag of a paper of yours?No, of course not, if we were doing an interview, Id ask first, Judd said.I just wanted to stop and say hi, its been three months since we were kidnapped.I never heard the story of what happened to you.By now the hall had cleared and only Judd and Lisa were left.It was an old courthouse, with wood floors and high ceilings.I should write a book about it, you wouldnt believe it if I told you, Lisa said.Same here, You want to get some coffee?Id love to chat with you about it.No, I have to see my mother, before they put her in prison.Judd looked out the window and saw the police van drive down the street.They took her already, see?he asked pointing out the window.Lisa watched the van drive away and head towards the womens prison.She knew shed see her mother again, but she was on an emotional roller coaster.Yeah, we can get some coffee, Lisa said.On the way out of the courtroom, Judd and Lisa had to stop when they saw the police escorting a large man in chains down the hall towards the judges offices.The man turned and looked at Judd and Lisa and smiled.It gave them both the creeps.For some reason, the man had a familiarity about him that Lisa couldnt shake.Who is that?Lisa asked.Hes on my list for this afternoon in court, his name is Eric Larson, on trial for beating his estranged wife to death.Why did he look at me like that?Lisa asked.Maybe you remind him of her?No, I recognize him, or something about him, the way he walked, or the way his face looked, I cant put my finger on it, Lisa said.Says here hes from Denton, you been to Denton?Judd asked.No, but that dont mean shit, people get around, I know I know him.Come back to court after lunch and sit in on the trial, Ill be in the front row, Judd said.One in the afternoon and Judd and Lisa are sitting in the gallery for the trial of Eric Larson accused of the murder of his wife Estelle.All rise, the bailiff said and everyone rose while the judge took his seat.You may be seated, the judge said.Call your first witness, he said to the prosecution.A young lawyer in a sharp grey suit stood and said, The prosecution calls Abigayle Johnson to the stand.Abigayle walked to the witness stand and took the oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help her God, she sat down and leaned close to the microphone.Then the prosecutor stepped in close and asked, Mrs.Johnson, are you married?Yes, she replied.How long have you been married?About forty five years now, she replied.So that puts you at about what age?Im seventy two years old, Mrs.Johnson replied.Mrs.Johnson, when exactly did you stop menstruating?Oh, Id say about 1987,  Then a voice from the defenders table.I object your honor, this line of questioning is absurd.The judge spoke up, Where exactly are you going with this Mr.Prosecutor?We are trying to establish that at the murder scene there was a large amount of blood in the carpet and on the walls.We want to show that the blood did not in fact come from the landlady Mrs.Johnson, because she stopped having periods over thirty years ago.Wouldnt a simple D. N. A.  test prove that fact?the judge asked.It would if there was a clean sample, but the blood was highly contaminated.The only other possible source of a quantity of blood that large would have been from Mrs.Johnsons menses.That is fucking stupid, the judge said.Dont waste my time with such drivel.Now call a witness that can actually help your case or move on so the defense can make a case.Pissed, the lawyer stomped back to his table and rifled through his notes.The prosecution calls Franz Rosenthal to the stand.From the rear of the gallery, a short bald man in a t shirt and shorts stepped through the gate and walked up to the witness stand.After swearing in, the prosecutor asked him, What do you do for a living Mr.Rosenthal?I fix appliances, Rosenthal replied.Were you in the house the day the body of Mrs.Estelle Larson was found?Yes, I was called in to do a repair the day before and scheduled to be there between nine and noon.When did you show up?One thirty, Rosenthal replied.I got busy with a dishwasher.What did you find when you entered the house?I found that ape trying to mop up blood from the kitchen floor, Rosenthal replied.Can you identify this Ape as you put it?Rosenthal pointed at the defendants table, right at the man that gave Lisa the creeps.Thats him, right there in the orange jumpsuit.For the record, let it reflect that Mr.Rosenthal is pointing to the defendant, Eric Larson.Eric turned and looked at Lisa and stared at her with a grin on his face.She didnt know why she was singled out, but the defendant made it very clear he was looking at her.Then he looked back at the prosecutor and shook his head.Why did he do that?Lisa whispered to Judd.I dont know, but it was obvious he was looking at you.Now I know I know him from somewhere, Lisa said.That mannerisms, the way he looked, fuck I know it.It will come to you, just wait.The prosecutor again addressed Rosenthal.What happened when the defendant saw you enter the house?He freaked and tried to beat me with the mop, I took a few good hits and ran the fuck out of there.Did you ever actually see Mrs.Larson on the floor?No, all I saw was the blood and him trying to hit me with a bloody mop, Rosenthal replied.Thank you, your witness, the prosecutor said to the defense.The defense lawyer got up and approached Rosenthal at the witness stand.Is it true that you were tried in this very court for having child pornography on your computer?Objection!the prosecutor yelled.What does that have to do with this case?It shows character your honor the defense lawyer replied.Ill allow it, the judge stated.Yeah, I was tried, but I wasnt found guilty of anything.It was a baseless charge brought on by my bitch ex wife who wanted to drag me through the mud because I found another woman.Not guilty is not the same as innocent, the defense stated.No, but thats what they found, Im clean in the eyes of the law, Rosenthal replied.Whos on trial here anyway, me or that fuckbag over there in the orange?Im the one asking the questions, the defense stated.No further questions.You may present your next witness, the judge said.I would like to call Officer John Akimoto to the stand, the prosecutor said.Again, from the gallery, a man, this time dressed in uniform approached the witness stand and took the oath.He sat down and waited for the prosecutor to begin.Officer Akimoto, are you familiar with the case we are tying today?the prosecutor asked.Yes, I was called to the scene.Where you the first on at the scene?Yes.Please tell us what you observed.When I arrived at the house, I observed the defendant stuffing a body into a sleeping bag.Did you identify the body?Yes, it was the defendant's wife Estelle Larson.Were you able to identify the cause of death?the prosecutor asked.There were several kitchen knives spilled onto the floor from a butcher block, at the time I assumed it was from one of them.What happened when you confronted the defendant?He stopped what he was doing, I had my weapon drawn on him, and he placed his hands behind his head and got down on his knees, officer Akimoto replied.Did he try to resist?No, he laid down and placed his hands behind his back, I cuffed him and waited for backup.Did the defendant say anything to you at that time?No, I dont believe so, officer Akimoto replied.Im done with the witness, the prosecutor stated.Your witness, the judge said to the defense.No questions your honor, the defense said.We will recess until after lunch, Judge said.Then Lisa saw Eric Larson stand up, still bound in chains and turn to look at her, he mouthed some words she couldnt understand and smiled at her.She gave him the look that she didnt understand what he said and he got frustrated.He mouthed the words again and waited for a response, she thought he said, You thought you could...and then, Im back.She missed the middle and the words made no sense or context.Are you sure you dont know this guy?Judd asked.Never seen him in my life, Lisa replied.Then why did he just say that you thought you could leave him to die, watch out bitch, Im back?20   Womens prison      Anne spent her first night in prison with a large black woman who seemed way too interested in her.She was in the same pod, but housed three cells to her left.At the dinner table, Anne sat alone while this woman and her friends stared at her like a freak at the circus.Anne knew being new would be hard, and planned on being targeted, but not this fast.Then the large black woman walked over and sat across the table from her.I saw you on TV, the woman said.Anne didnt reply.My name is Vaniqa, I run this place.I see, Anne stated looking down at the table.Look me in the eye, Vaniqa said.I have some rules for you, you need to listen up, and Im not going to tell them to you again, you understand me?Anne nodded in agreement.First, never rat on an inmate, don't be nosy, don't have loose lips, and never put an inmate on the spot.Second, dont tell the guards anything that could get yourself or another inmate in trouble, and last, youre my bitch, and nobody elses, you got that?I own your ass.Anne looked at the other women sitting at the table Vaniqa came from, there were three others and she knew she had to comply.Do you have any questions?Vaniqa asked.Anne bit her lip and shook her head no.First things first, I want you in my cell in half an hour.Why?Anne asked timidly.I need to initiate you, let you know whos in charge.What does that mean?Anne asked.That means you get to pet my bald cat, Vaniqa replied.Anne closed her eyes and unknowingly shook her head.She didnt realize she was doing it.What you shaking your head about girl?Vaniqa asked.What do you expect?You better get used to pussy, youre going to be eating and fucking it a lot.If youre good, I might lend you out, but for now, you better practice you tongue techniques.Vaniqa left the table and joined her fellow inmates.Anne laid her head down in her arms and closed her eyes, she wanted this nightmare to all go away.Thirty minutes later, Anne knocked on Vaniqas cell door.Nobody answered, she knocked again and pushed on the door, it opened and Anne saw a black woman on the floor lying motionless.She was scared shitless and didnt know what to do, then she felt a hand shove her into the cell and heard the door close behind.When she turned around it was one of the female guards with another standing behind her.Whats going on?Anne asked.Looks like you murdered Vaniqa to me, one of the guards said.No, I didnt murder anyone, Anne replied.I just got here.She was going to rape you, you got pissed and snapped her neck, thats what I saw, the same guard said.I dont believe this, Ive been here one day and already Ive been threatened, almost raped and now accused of the murder of the woman I was supposed to have sex with, what kind of nut house is this?Anne asked.Were going to turn you over to the warden, come with us, the guard said.Anne complied and followed one of the guards out of the cell followed by the other.They walked along the walkway to the exit door that led to the offices.Once they reached the wardens office, they knocked and they were buzzed in, Anne stood before the warden awaiting her fate.Who the fuck is this?the warden asked.He was a sixty year old something with a suit and tie.Caught this bitch killing Vaniqa, a guard said with a wink.Here one day and youre already killing my inmates?the warden asked.I didnt touch her, Anne replied.Where did you find her?the warden asked the guard.She was in Vaniqas cell, Vaniqa was already dead when we got there.I see, the warden said.What was your problem with her?he asked.I had a huge problem with the fact she wanted me to meet her bald cat, but I didn't get that far.She was dead when I got there.I think I should call the police and report an inmate on inmate murder.That should increase your sentence by another forty years.Go ahead, Im already here for eighty, whats another forty?Anne asked.Tell you what, Ill make you a deal, the warden said.I could use another white girl around the office, if you scratch my back, Ill scratch yours.You want me to pet your bald cat too?Anne asked.More like my bald snake if you know what I mean, the warden replied.So let me get this straight, I put out for you, and I dont go down for the framed murder of a woman I had met thirty minutes ago?Framed?the warden asked.Thats a harsh accusation.Whatever, whip it out, lets do this, Anne said frustrated.I like your spunk, the warden said unbuttoning his pants.He produced his old wrinkled cock and let it hang.Come over here, he said and turned in his chair so Anne could get a good angle.She got down on her knees and took the wardens limp cock in her mouth, for the next ten minutes she worked on it until he blew in her mouth.She didnt want to swallow his blow so she spit it on the carpet.You stupid cunt!the warden yelled.Not on my carpet, you swallow that shit!Do you understand me!Anne leaned back and wiped her lips.She looked at the white cum left on her hand and then back at the warden.I understand, she said.I want you back here by four, Im going to punish you for that, he said.Now get me a janitor!he yelled at the guards and they took off leaving Anne behind.What a bunch of stupid fucks, he said.They left you alone with me, thats a huge no no.Dont think about doing anything till they get back.Are you afraid of me?Anne asked.Im not a young man anymore, the warden replied.Yeah, I can see that, your cock is disgusting.Why is it that everyone that lives here wants to rape me?Youre new, you have fresh pussy, no STDs or other issues.You are like gold, probably why Vaniqa was killed.So you dont think I did it?Anne asked.Fuck no, but when I knew she was dead, I had me my new white girl, the warden replied.Youre the warden, you can have whatever you want, are you afraid of your own inmates?Anne asked.Fuck yes, those ass wipes would kill me in a second if they had a chance.I bet, Anne said.So now what?I want you as my personal inmate assistant, youll do chores for me in the office and whatever else I want during the day.Im a horny old bastard so get ready to be on your knees a lot.What if I refuse?Then I have my guards set you up with the Latinos, they wont be nearly as nice as I am, you should think of me as your protection, as long as youre fucking me, nobody will fuck with you.Im supposed to feel thankful to you for that?Anne asked.How else would you feel?Would you rather have a shank in your back?You killed your husband and some queer, youre going to pay for that for the rest of your life.You will constantly have to be looking over your shoulder.It would do you well to have me on your side.Fine, Ill do whatever you want, my life is shit now anyway, Anne said.Dont be so depressed, youll get used to this life, youll actually get to enjoy it later on.Just take your time and get used to it.How many girls have you done this too?Anne asked.Made your personal assistant?Six or seven over the years, Ive only been warden here since 89.Ever knock one up?Several actually, the warden replied.What happened to them?We have our own graveyard north of the fence, I think they are buried there.You killed them?Anne asked.No, Id never kill an inmate.The guards returned with a janitor and were scolded by the warden.They took Anne back down to the commons area of the pod and let her go.The warden decided to pin the death of Vaniqa on someone else and let Anne fester for a while getting used to her surroundings.Once she had some time in prison, shed be more likely to do whatever he asked.The next morning Anne woke with her cellmate sucking on her tit.What the fuck are you doing?she yelled.You werent using it, the woman replied.Get the fuck off me!Anne shouted and pushed the woman onto the floor.Who are you anyway?Jackie, Jackie replied.When did you get in here?I didnt even know I had a cellmate.The guards put me in her at three in the morning.I was busy taking care of some of them if you know what I mean.No, I dont know what you mean.I was fucking them dumb ass, letting them in my fuck hole.Who says Fuck hole?Anne asked.I don't, get over yourself, bitch,  Why does everyone call everyone else a bitch?Are we going to have a stupid conversation or are you going to let me back at that tit?Jackie asked.You were getting laid four hours ago, aren't you sexed out?Oh no, I can go twenty four seven, I am a sex machine.Well, I cant, I used to do about six hours a day of it and that was too much.Im not interested in women anyway.Like that matters, you have two choices honey, the male guards or the female inmates and its not as easy to get cock here than pussy.I have a pussy, I dont need yours, Anne snarked back.Let me tell you something sister, you will learn that your privates arent so private after all.You will be someones bitch and you will put out when told.You call it rape, we call it survival.Thats fine, but I want to go back to bed, so go survive over there on your side of the room, Anne said.Fine, be that way, you wont be for long.I can guarantee you that.Jackie said sliding across the floor to the other side of the room.Just so you know, Im here because I shot two people, one was my husband, Im not afraid of you or anyone else here.You dont have a gun to hide behind here missy, and there are more of us than there are of you.You had the advantage then, we have it now.Just out of curiosity, what are you in for?Anne asked.Embezzlement, Jackie replied.I stole seventy five thousand dollars from the city of Sparksville.How did you do that?Do I look stupid to you?Do you think every woman in here is a crack whore, or a child abuser?I have a degree in accounting, I worked in the city offices for twelve years.I had access to more money than you will ever see.So how did you get caught if youre so damn smart?Anne asked.My I got in a fight with my baby daddy and he turned me in.If it werent for that fucker, Id still be out there free.21   Eastwood      Judd and Lisa were in Subway when they heard the news on the television on the wall, Eric Larson has escaped from jail transport vehicle and is on the loose, the reporter said with video of the open van and a guard lying on the ground.Thats like three blocks from here, Judd said looking at the video playback.We need to go, Lisa said, I have a feeling hes after me.Where can we go?Were as well off here as anywhere else.We can hide in the back till they find him, Lisa said.Both Lisa and Judd got up from the table and walked over to the counter.There they spoke to one of the sandwich artists, Can we hide in your back room?There is an escaped killer on the loose, Lisa said pointing to the television.Let me ask my manager, the clerk said and she disappeared behind into the back room.A few minutes later the manager stepped out.What can I do for you?he asked.I want to know if me and my friend can hide in your back room?There is a killer on the loose, about three blocks from here, its on the television.The manager looked at Lisa like she was nuts.I dont think thats a good idea, we have food stored back here and I dont want to get turned into the health department for letting people walk around in it.I said there is a killer three blocks away!Lisa yelled.And hes coming after me!Sorry, I cant help you.But I can get you a refill on your drink if youd like.I dont need a fucking refill, I need to hide!Then Judd tapped Lisa on the shoulder and got her attention, he pointed to the front door where Eric Larson stood almost scraping his head on the top of the door.This man was huge.Lisa, Eric said low and slow.Nice to see you again.Lisa stood there frozen, she didnt have a way to get to the back room, she was blocked off by the sandwich counter and there was no other door in sight.Who are you?she asked.Eric stepped into the room and stopped five feet from Lisa and Judd.You dont recognize me?he said with a laugh.No, well sort of, you do seem familiar, she replied.Its me, Toby, he said to her horror.Toby?she asked.But you are...Are what?Dead?You left me to die, with that witch, she cut off my tail and killed me.But how?She had a spell of rebirth she didnt know was cast in that room, when I died I was reborn into this body.Why that body?Why did you kill your wife?Lisa asked.I didnt know she was my wife at the time, when I woke in this body she was swinging a knife at me, I took it and hacked her up, Toby said.What do you want with me?Lisa asked.Its your fault this happened to me, because of your greed and total disregard for me, Im now this horrible monster.Im so sorry, Lisa said.Sorry?You didnt act sorry when you had the chance to go home and leave me to die.You could have stayed with me, but no, and you will pay for what you did you selfish piece of shit!Judd tried to step forward but was too chicken.He stood still and hoped Toby wouldnt take out his rage on him.Who are you?Judd asked.I was her friend, I was her little beaver that tagged along and kept her safe, and then she abandon me to a witch when she had the choice of keeping me alive and staying or killing me and going home.You blame her for wanting to go home?Judd asked.I blame her for putting her home before my life, Toby said.But you were a beaver, not a person!Now very pissed, Toby stepped forward and grabbed Judd by the collar and pulled him up close to his face.Toby had very bad breath and a grip like a weight lifter.I dont give a fuck if I were a person or not, my life is as important as anyone elses, do you agree?Toby asked.Judd cowered down and said, Yes.Toby then grabbed Lisa and tore her clothes off in front of all the customers, nobody tried to help her.I liked you naked before, I like you naked now, Toby said.Lisa stood naked covering her privates with her arms.Didnt bother you before, now why cover up?Toby said with a grin.He took her by the arm and pulled her towards the door.Before he got all the way, he looked back at Judd and said, Are you going to stop me?and laughed.Toby was not the same Toby he was before, he was mean, and vengeful.Judd stood back like a chickenshit watching the girl he was falling for being pulled out of Subway nude.Did anyone call 911?he shouted.I did, a voice came from the table by the window.Does anyone have a gun?Judd asked.Three hands raised, one with a pistol.Judd took the gun and walked out the door looking for Lisa and Toby, they were fifty feet away walking down the street.Where they were going was anyones guess.Judd looked at the gun, it was a revolver, and he didnt know how to shoot it so he pointed it up in the air and pulled the trigger to see what would happen.Bam he heard and an echo popped back from the building across the street, it worked fine and was easy to use.Now that Judd knew how to use the gun, he took off running towards Toby and Lisa.It took less than a minute to catch up.
