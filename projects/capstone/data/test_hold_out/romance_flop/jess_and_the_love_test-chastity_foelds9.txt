journey)        		  Prologue  Owen sat by the phone, naked and sweating.He feared it would ring, yet he wanted it to ring.As he waited for it to ring, hoping it would ring, praying it would ring, his eyes scanned the leaded glass window.Ripples from the raging flames in the fireplace peppered the imperfect glass with bright promises of orange, but that wasnt what engaged Owens sight.He was watching for headlights coming from cars on the road.The rural road was not often travelled.Usually, when a car came down the road, it was coming to the estate where Owen sat waiting in the gatehouse.He was naked, but he was ready at a moments notice to don whatever clothing he was told to put on by the voice at the other end of the phone line.All for Bree.Sweet Bree.My sweet Bree.Owen would do anything for his Bree hed proven that over and over.Soon it would be time to do so again.The phone rang.Owens stomach twisted into a knot.Owen looked down at the table next to his wingback chair.Beside the phone was a stack of business cards.Well, not really business cards, but rather coupons, or redemption tickets.They all said the same thing, scarlet lettering over a glossy black background.Mistress Made Me.Natural Habitat  Owen sorted envelopes, as he did every weekday, buried in a basement mailroom.Four years on his Bachelors, and two on his MBA, and he was sorting mail in the dank basement of a third rate office building.Business school didnt prepare him for this economy.And no one told him eighty thousand dollars of debt for a degree from a run of the mill school was not a good investment.He unwrapped his Twinkie and bent to his work, pulling down his sorted piles and placing them in his pushcart.The telltale click clack of Virginia Stiles heels sounded down the concrete hall.Ms.Stiles always wore the most elegant shoes, almost always high heels, and Owen knew her gait by heart.Owen was an aficionado of womens shoes.He couldnt identify brands, but he knew what he liked.It came from a lifetime spent almost always looking down.Owen could seldom recall the color of a womans eyes, but he would always recognize her shoes.There were two reasons for anyone to come into the basement of the building: to check on the boiler, or to stop by the mailroom.Virginia Stiles would have no reason to check on the boiler.Owen crammed the remaining two thirds of Twinkie into his mouth and quickly swallowed.Virginia Stiles detested eating on the job, junk food in particular.Virginia Stiles stood in the doorway, her hands on each jamb, taking command of the space like she took command of every space she occupied.Virginia Stiles tapped her toe.Owen, she said.Did my niece get any mail?Owens eyes traced up Virginia Stiles smooth calves, rising along her pencil skirt, and rested upon her trim waist.Hed worked for Virginia Stiles for two years, but still didnt know if she wore glasses or how she styled her bangs.Yes, Ms.Stiles, Owen replied, trying to swallow down the last bit of the Twinkies delicious crme.Yes, she did, Owen said.He surreptitiously wiped away any Twinkie residue that might be on his mouth.Virginia Stiles chuckled.Be a dear and be sure she gets it as soon as possible.I will, Ms.Stiles.Are you happy working here, Owen?At Pure Rile Media?Yes, I am.No, I mean here in the mailroom.Owen swallowed hard, thought twice, and croaked out, Not particularly, Ms.Stiles, no.But Im grateful for the job, and I do what needs doing.Virginia Stiles clucked her tongue.Thats a very good answer Owen.Excellent, in fact.Keep up the good work.Carry on!Owen listened to Virginia Stiles purposeful strides up the corridor, back to the real world.She was only fifteen years or so older than Owen, which put her in her mid forties, yet she was in charge of this whole company.Must be nice.And a hot body, too.
