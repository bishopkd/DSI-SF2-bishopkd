I still cant give you an absolution on what that means for us.She watched his expression go from thoughtful to forlorn.I really like you, Luke.Lenny wanted to grab him and kiss him.But, logistically, how do you see this playing out?He frowned at her and she continued.Youre a rock star and you have this hugely successful job that requires you to be gone for long periods of time.And Im considering going back to competing which also requires a lot of travel.She took a breath.We might not see much of each other after the rest of this tour.We could make it work.He said moving to sit next to her on the bed.Lenny nodded, knowing that was a possibility.I dont think it would be smart for either of us to promise something that huge before we know if thats something we really want.Luke took one of her hands in both of his.Are giving me the lets just be friends talk?He smiled, only half kidding.Lennys eyes widened.No, not at all.I just think we should enjoy what we have right now and not put so much pressure on what might be.Luke looked down at her hand and chuckled.Maybe Blakes right, maybe we are just a couple of hipsters.Lenny took her other hand and touched his face, directing his eyes back up to hers.Ill tell you what this is.She whispered.Im your girl, and youre my guy.When his gaze traveled to her lips she felt her pulse quicken.I really enjoyed watching your interview.Luke said slowly, his eyes flicking back and forth from her eyes to her lips.Oh, yeah?Lenny raised an eyebrow in question.Yeah, Luke leaned in fractionally.I've never seen that reckless side of you before, it was kinda hot.Lenny smiled slowly as Luke leaned closer.You thought it was hot?His lips finally touched hers and an electric current ripped through her body.He delicately and determinedly worked his lips against hers.She grabbed his shirt in both hands and pulled him closer.One of his arms slipped around her back while the other cupped her face, directing their course of action.The kiss heated quickly and her body responded.Her hands found themselves twisting into his hair, pulling him closer.Lenny had only been kissed a handful of times in her life and no one ignited her the way Luke did.She let an involuntary whimper when Luke slowly ended the kiss and stood up.He took a steadying breath and gave her a knowing smile.We have to be careful, he whispered in his gravelly voice.I havent kissed you in a long time and Im afraid I could ask for too much too fast.Lennys stomach trembled as she understood what he was implying.And she agreed, she hadnt kissed him like that in weeks and it was like someone had set her lips on fire.She would have a hard time saying no.Unlike with Shane, where her thoughts never progressed past kissing, Luke made her want to throw caution to the wind.She waited for her heart to return to a normal rhythm before she cleared her throat and stood up.Maybe we should get some dinner after my demo.My dad is in town and he wanted to see you guys again.Thats a really good idea, Luke nodded.Knowing your dad is around will help keep my thoughts where they should be.He grinned and then winked.Well, for the most part.The table at the lodge style restaurant was long and wide, comfortably fitting the group of seven.The lights were low, and tiny candles inside glass lamps created small pools of radiance on the table cloth.Lenny looked around at the faces that she had become so fond of over the past few months.Blake and Harrison, Sway and Mike.Luke.Her father.Her gaze locked on Luke sitting across from her, his affection for her evident.It was less frightening than it was in the beginning, but it still left Lenny lightheaded and confused.Luke was carrying on a conversation with her father easily.Not something many people could do.Bruce Evans was always suspicious of those who had the potential to hurt his family.It was part of the reason Lenny had a hard time fully trusting someone, its how she was raised.She looked at her father.He was a good man.He had always encouraged Lenny to follow her dreams but he never made her decisions for her.He liked Luke.Lenny could tell by his laugh and the way he listened to Lukes stories.They had a lot in common, both from Boston, Celtics fans, avid fisherman, hated the same politicians.Lenny found herself picturing future holidays with both of these men, her mother and brothers.Was there a future there?With the rock star?Lenny didnt know how that could work.Maybe the details didnt matter right now.Youre quiet, Lenna.Does your food taste okay?Her father interrupted her thoughts.His face was relaxed and not pinched and worried like it had been for the past two years.Yeah, its goodI was just thinking.Lenny answered softly, not wanting to break the quiet ethereal spell that had seemed to settle over the table.What were you thinking about, honey?Her father genuinely wanted to know.I got on a board today.She let the words hang in the moment.Her father sat up a little straighter in his chair and a smile began to stretch across his face.He was proud.It was always obvious when he was proud.And she did great, Luke added.You got to see it?Her father asked in an excited whisper.It was just a short demo ride.Lenny couldnt hold back her delight, But it felt really good.The guys started to bombard her with questions, suddenly sensing that the subject was no longer taboo.They knew Lennys dad didnt know she had been riding again so they had been trying to be careful.Apparently they had a lot they had been wondering about.Lenny gladly answered their queries and told some stories she hadnt thought about in a while.Luke loved seeing Lennys face glow with enthusiasm as she finally spoke about her most cherished pastime.He could never imagine giving up music for anything.Her return to snowboarding was obviously liberating.Its because of you.Lennys father leaned over and spoke to Luke without the others overhearing.Dont think I havent noticed the remarkable change in my daughter since you entered the picture.He took a drink of his water and replaced his napkin on his lap.I hope you stick around.Luke watched Lennys bright expression and replied, I intend to.He knew, without knowing how, that the love he felt was so much more than anything hed felt before.He also knew that it was Duke, and not himself, that had pushed her to trust herself again.That gnawing feeling was still in the pit of Lukes stomach.Duke and Lenny had a connection that couldnt be explained and Luke didnt know if he would ever be able to fill that role.Duke had boldly encouraged Luke to pursue Lenny; he seemed pleased with the arrangement.But Luke had been able to sense Dukes underlying feelings for Lenny, even if Lenny didnt know about them.And wasnt it ultimately Lennys decision in the end anyway?Or could two men, both in love with the same woman, just decide between them who would get her?Lenny wasnt a piece of property that could be passed back and forth, exchanging one master for another.She would have to decide.She was the only one who had that power.Luke looked at her from across the table and tried to relax.She was his girl right now.He chose to focus on that.14    All Apologies      When dinner had ended, Lenny said farewell to her father and climbed into the shuttle van with the rest of the band.She slid the door closed behind her and took a seat in the middle next Luke, who rolled his eyes at the argument taking place behind him.Lenny looked over his shoulder and saw Mike with his arms crossed over his chest and a glower on his face.Sway was against the window, his focus on his cell phone.And poor Harrison, squashed between them.The van was quiet as it bumped along the road, returning them to the hotel.Lenny wasn't sure why it seemed so tense and awkward; obviously something had happened when she wasn't looking.I didn't say you were hiding anything.I just asked a question.That's all.Mike broke the silence.Lenny felt Luke sigh heavily next to her.It's none of your business, so back off!Sway snapped.Lenny's head whirled around in surprise but Luke put his hand on her knee and signaled her to not get involved.The van stopped and Luke gestured for Lenny to exit quickly.The rest of the guys bailed out behind them.Sway  Mike tried again.Seriously, Mike!Stop being so frickin' insecure!Sway cut him off.I have a freaking friend!Can't I have a one freaking friend outside of this stupid band?!Lenny stood stock still.The guys argued sometimes but this was intense, even for them.Okay, Sway and I are going to see if we can catch that half pipe shit.Blake calmly put an arm around the bassist's shoulders and directed him away from the group.Sway threw a final glare in Mike's direction.He's overreacting.Mike tried to defend himself but Luke just shook his head at his friend.You guys push each other's buttons, you always have.Luke placed a hand on the small of Lenny's back.Mike's brows pushed together and his mouth formed a hard line.Harrison clapped a hand down on Mike's shoulder, drawing his attention.C'mon, man.Harrison's eyes filled with compassion.Let's take a walk.Mike's jaw clenched momentarily before he relented and followed his friend.Lenny looked up at Luke, completely confused.What was that all about?Luke directed her back to the hotel and opened the door for her.They have a rocky history.Some wounds take longer to heal than others.They'll be fine, Blake will talk Sway down and Harrison will figure out what's eating at Mike.They'll all be best friends again in no time.Lenny frowned, Luke seemed pretty sure of the outcome but she had never seen Sway that pissed off before.They walked to her hotel room and she opened the door, still thinking about the scene she'd just witnessed.Luke sat on the couch and patted the seat next to him so she'd join him.Don't let it worry you.They can act like they want to kill each other sometimes, but its short lived.I guess I have to take your word for it.Lenny pursed her lips.I don't know them as well as you do...obviously.That last thought troubled her.She had been under the impression that she'd gotten close to these guys, but there was still so much she didn't know.She rested against Luke's side as he switched on the TV, she would probably never know them as well as Luke did.You said...Lenny bit the inside of her cheek, not sure if she should allow her curiosity to get the better of her.You said something about old wounds...?Luke sighed and raised his eyebrows.Yeah...a few years ago, Mike had a girlfriend.Lenny adjusted herself on the sofa and laid down with her head on Luke's thighs.She folded her hands across her stomach and waited patiently for him to continue.Her name was Ilsa.She was a model from Berlin.Luke rubbed his stubble with one hand and placed the other hand across Lenny's.Mike was crazy in love with her but she was...undecided.She had a problem with him using and she went to Sway for...advice.Oh.Lenny breathed as she followed that train of thought.Yep.Long story short, Sway and Ilsa got closer than friends and she dumped Mike for him.Mike overdosed the next day.Damn.Lenny had no idea.No wonder they had issues.That would be hard to move past.She felt guilt cramp in her stomach having the information inside of her now.Hey, don't feel bad.Luke ran his finger across her hairline.They would've told you eventually, you're part of the band.It's so personal, I feel like I shouldn't know.That's because you have a good heart.Luke smiled down at her and Lenny involuntarily blushed.He stared down at her for few minutes, not speaking, a look a pure contentment on his face.I like this.He said quietly.His deep voice vibrating through his chest and into Lennys shoulder.Whats that?Lenny asked.Just being here with you.Lenny closed her eyes and smiled.She liked this too.Finally, after all the drama that had occurred during the past few days, they had time to just...be.Together.His hand traveled down hers and his fingers worked their way into her own.They had nowhere to go, no one expecting them.What?Luke asked her.Lenny opened her eyes.What?He grinned at her, Youre smiling.I wanted to know why.I guess Im just happy.Lenny answered honestly.Youre not gonna jump up and run away from me?Luke teased.Nope.She chuckled lightly.Not today.Luke was just about to say something when there was a knock on the door, interrupting their cozy moment.Lenny sat up and went to answer it.Luke watched her move with more self assurance than before.Getting her back to the sport she loved was still multiplying in subtle improvements.Luke had to wonder if he could handle all of Lenny at the top of her game.He sure wanted to try.Lenny opened the door and Harrison stood before her, eyes wide.Whats up, Harry?Lenny asked and Luke smiled at how sweet she was to his friends.He got off the couch and joined her at the door.I thought maybe I should come and get you.Harrisons voice was nervous and Luke suppressed a chuckle.Codys calling you out.What do you mean?Lenny's eyebrows drew together.She finished her event and set a new world record and shes challenging you to come out and beat it.Harrison was positively giddy with excitement.Shes really working up the crowd.Thats ridiculous, Harrison.Im not registered for an event.Lenny was shaking her head.Luke rested his hand on her back, letting her know he was there.Maybe you should try to talk to her, Harrison shrugged.I was gonna have to deal with it eventually.Lenny rolled her eyes as she grabbed her coat and hat.The air outside was electric as Lenny made her way through the crowd.With the sun down it had grown considerably colder than it had been that afternoon.The sky was clear with stars making sharp pin pricks in the night sky.Lenny made her way up to the small press booth at the top of the X Course.It was a long walk and she had time to get an idea of what she would say to Cody.She would probably have to apologize for slandering her to the media.She again pictured  Patrick, paperwork in hand.The crowds started out overcharged and exuberant but as Lenny trekked through the terrain to the top of the hill, they quieted considerably.Luke and Harrison were flanking her.It was eerie, Lenny noted, like they were all watching her walk fatefully to her demise.She laughed off the thought internally.Sports always brought out the dramatics in people.As she approached the booth she recognized Brad from earlier, Cody of course and Shane, not surprisingly.They would have to provide a united front to the public, Lenny supposed.A handful of others stood around and nearby, either with the media or with the X Games organization itself.Sway, Mike and Blake waited with their arms crossed, whatever previous quarrel they may have had was forgotten in this moment and they were once again united.Lenny met Codys eye contact and felt a twinge of guilt for having betrayed her friend earlier that day.Cody had betrayed her long ago, but Lenny had always hoped she was just little better than that.Turns out, she wasnt.She couldnt go back now, none of them could.What Shane and Cody had done was irreversible, Lenny could never trust them again.Maybe someday shed work on the forgiveness aspect of it, but not yet.What do you want Cody?Lenny addressed her former friend.You said you were better than me earlier today.Cody answered with a smugness Lenny knew was completely genuine.I want you to prove it.Cody, Im not registered in any events.I havent qualified for anything.Lenny tried to speak slowly, like she was explaining the facts to a small child.I know youre pissed but you cant just expect me to strap in and compete.Actually, Cody crossed her arms, All events are done for the evening and my good friend Grant, here, said we can run the course.Just you and I.   Lenny looked at the course manager whose face was bright red.He nodded and looked down sheepishly.Cody could manipulate anyone, Lenny thought, her face twisting in disgust.She glanced up at Shane who had positioned his large frame behind Cody like he was her muscle.Lenny looked around at the band who had taken up positions of support around her.This is sad, its like the jocks against the band geeks all over again.Unless all that stuff you said today was just a lie, Cody baited her.So that was her play, Lenny mused.If Lenny didnt take the challenge, than everything Lenny had accused them of earlier that day would look like a lie, tarnishing Lennys integrity with the press and her fans forever.Lenny sighed in resignation.Whether or not she was ready for this, it was going to happen.You dont have to do anything you dont want to do.Luke was talking to her now.You dont have to prove anything to anyone.We know the truth.Yeah, Harrison added, We know that youre better than this hussy.Cody frowned at his word.Hussy?What, is this the 1800s?She rolled her eyes.Idiot.Hey!Blake snapped, He may be an idiot, but hes our idiot!This was quickly turning into a television sitcom, Lenny noted.She needed to get a handle on her guys.She turned her back to Cody and grouped them in a huddle.I can do this, she whispered with excitement.She was near giddy with anticipation.I can beat her.Lenny, you havent competed in almost three years.Im sorry, but a couple of good runs down the hill at home arent the same thing.Sway patiently pointed out.Lenny appreciated his concern, it was a side of Sway that he didnt show often and it was kind of sweet.What would Duke say if he were here?Mike wanted to know.Lenny considered that for a minute before a wide smile spread across her face.Hed tell me to kick her ass.Luke winked at her and nodded his approval.Then, kick her ass.Lenny faced Cody again.I dont have any of my equipment so Ill have to borrow someones.Lenny was addressing the crowd more than Cody.She took pleasure in the shocked look that sprang to Cody and Shanes faces.They obviously had expected her to back out.How little they remembered of who she really was.Fellow athletes started to outfit her with everything she would need; a board, goggles, gloves, boots.Lenny was touched by their words of encouragement and anticipation for the upcoming race.What, exactly do you have to do to win?Luke asked as she put on her borrowed gear.She heard the anxiety that he was trying to hide and it made her smile.Luke had never seen her compete before and she was looking forward to showing off just a little bit.The course has variable terrain, with berms and gap jumps, turns, drops and steep and flat sections.Basically, everything.Whoever gets to the bottom first, wins, she grinned at him.You sure youre ready for this?He raised an eyebrow at her.Lenny looked around at the crowd, a familiar buzzing pressure in the back of her skull.Their faces were full of wonder and excitement and she was feeling it.While back country riding was indeed her forte, performing for an audience was her guilty pleasure.She enjoyed knowing she was the best and knowing she was going to completely dominate her opponent.The fact that it was Cody and that Lenny had finally come to terms with what she and Shane had done, made it that much more exhilarating.Normally, snowboard cross was run in the daylight with four riders at a time on the course.It was way past dark and spotlights had been turned on in order to light the run.It would still be tricky, blind spots everywhere.Lenny was even more confident in her ability to conquer.She had a connection with the snow and her board that shed never been able to explain.It was as if she could feel the ground change before it actually happened.She had the advantage.I got this.She winked at Luke.Youre about to see something amazing.She wasnt trying to be cocky, she was being honest.Luke was incredibly turned on by Lennys attitude.Sometimes girls put on a front to look tough but there was nothing fake about what Lenny was feeling.Hed seen her do things with ease that trained professionals struggled to accomplish.He was proud that she was willing to call herself his girl when she was as wild and untamed as the mountains she came from.He impulsively grabbed her face with his mittened hands and kissed her lips passionately.A loud roar broke out from the observers and Luke realized that their relationship had just gone public.He had been so careful to protect it, not wanting Lenny to get caught in the tabloids cross hairs.But it was out now.Cameras flashed and the TV crews scrambled to get a better angle.He pulled away from Lenny and tried to downplay what had just happened.Lenny smiled at him, her crooked half smile that said everything would be fine.She turned and waved to the crowd and cameras, blowing them kisses.The girl he had met months before, the one with the carefully guarded heart and a past full of painful secrets had all but disappeared.Lenny had been a mystery wrapped inside a riddle and somewhere along the way, Luke had cracked the code.He knew that to share his life of crazy travel and hard work he would have to find a partner who was strong and could adapt to changing situations.She stood before him now, a bundle of outerwear and a smile that lit the sky.He walked with her to the chute, his nerves melting away.They were replaced with a shiver, not from the cold, but from the clarity his heart had just experienced.Lenny had to be in his life for the remainder of it.Luke kissed her one last time before heading to the finish line.He promised to be there when she came in first.Sway and Blake went with him while Mike and Harrison stayed at the top to send her off.Arent you afraid youre gonna choke?Cody sneered at Lenny, You know, like last time?Her grey eyes were flat and cold, and Lenny found it sad that eyes identical to Duke's could be so foreign.Im sorry it has to come down to this Cody, Lenny responded coolly, But Im gonna crush you.Lenny lowered her goggles and covered her face with her mask, sealing out the cold.Yeah, youre not a nice person.Harrison added his own dig.He wasnt very good at trash talking.It was really best if he stuck to lead guitar, Lenny thought.Whatever.Cody mumbled and lowered her goggles.The pressure in the back of Lennys head had grown to a full scale roar in her ears.It drowned out the crowd and Mike and Harrisons final words of encouragement.She had an uncanny ability to separate herself from the rest of the world when she focused really hard.She could create a mental barrier, where only she and the task at hand existed.Thats where the pressure, the buzzing, came from.She relaxed her mind and enclosed herself in the moment.This was it.She completely blocked out everything around her and took a deep, steadying breath.She felt a smile spread across her face underneath her mask and waited.The start signal rang through the air and the two riders took off.Mike and Harrison strained their necks with the other screaming audience members, trying to get a good view.The girls dipped and disappeared and then reappeared, twisting and flying down the slope.Holy crap.Harrison muttered under his breath and Mike laughed out loud.Lenny could feel the perfect snow bend under her board and she almost laughed at how easy the course was.She could feel the curve beneath her and anticipated the jump ahead.She knew she had reached quite a height as her board made contact with the snow again.She saw Cody in her peripheral vision as she tried to cut across Lennys path.Lenny just slid to the side and shot past her.Luke couldnt see a lot from his vantage point at the bottom but he could hear the rise and fall of the audiences reaction to what was happening.He caught a glimpse of Lenny, flying high and he was reminded of her nickname 'Bird. 'She seemed lighter than air.It was as if coming back to earth was a challenge and she belonged among the stars.Lennys speed was increasing.She crouched lower, gaining more momentum, knowing it was dangerous and knowing she could handle it.Cody wasnt even close.Lenny hadnt seen her in a few turns.The pressure in Lennys head compressed and exploded in a brilliant star burst in her mind's eye as she took the last jump.I love my life.She had enough height and speed so she threw in an elegant stalefish, grabbing the board behind her back heel with her back hand and stretching out her body in the air.You know, for fun.The crowd erupted, finally registering in her awareness.She landed easily and had to quickly slow herself as she crossed the finish so as not to hit the barriers.Luke was with her in seconds, hugging her and yelling along with the crowd.Lenny removed her goggles and face mask and kissed him.Thirty seconds after Lenny had landed, Cody finally crossed the finish line.Lenny unhooked the bindings on her boots and walked over to Cody.Good race.Lenny stuck out her hand, she hoped this would end Codys ridiculous vendetta.Cody unhooked her bindings and picked up her board.C'mon, Cody, we used to be friends.Lenny tried to reach out to her, wondering if there was even anything salvageable left in their relationship.We haven't been friends in a long time.Cody clipped angrily.It should've been me that Duke coached, he was my uncle.It should have been me with all the sponsorships and the popularity.You never would have even tried snowboarding if I wouldn't have invited you.And this is how you repay me?Some friend you are.Cody, this whole thing was your idea.I have no idea how you can continue blaming me for your shortcomings.It isn't my fault.Stay away from me.Cody spun around and stalked away.Geez, sore loser.Luke said from beside her.Lenny shrugged.She couldnt change Cody.She had met her challenge and had beaten her at her own game.What more did Cody want?Lennys time wasnt an official recording because it wasnt an official race.But that didnt matter, it still made headlines the next morning.Well, that and her now public relationship with Luke Casey.Suddenly, it seemed, the crowds realized that rock stars were among them and the guys were inundated with autograph and picture requests.Lenny was proud of the guys.They never expected special treatment or attention but when it happened, they always handled it with class.Giving each fan eye contact and listening to them gush.Especially Luke, he could make whoever he was talking to feel like that was the most important conversation he was going to have all day.The entire next day was busy for all of them.Lenny had two interviews to do and a few more stops at X Fest for the sponsors.And the guys were the newest attraction.Cody and Shane kept out of the ruckus as much as possible.Lenny felt a little bit bad for embarrassing Cody the night before but Cody had asked for it.Right?During both of her interviews, Lenny was asked about her and Lukes relationship and she just smiled as a reply.That wasnt the publics business.Her feelings for Luke were definitely growing but he deserved to hear those words from her firsthand, not from a sound bite.The sponsors went gaga over her performance the night before and started to throw more deals at her.Lenny deferred them to Patrick, choosing to make those kinds of business decisions when the tour was finished.She didnt want to overbook herself again.She was feeling more in control of her life than she had in a long time.It seemed that the downward spiral she had feared had leveled out into smooth riding.As more of the X Games events wrapped up that night, Lenny snuggled close to Luke in the Athlete's Lounge at the Inn.The Lounge was nearly vacant, just a few people here and there.It was a nice place to relax since media and civilians werent allowed.Lenny was happy.Not ecstatically or anything.Just regular, normal, happy.She liked having Luke with her for her important life stuff.She wanted him to stay forever.I dont have any obligations tomorrow.Lenny said quietly, her fingers making a trail across the top of his strong hands.Mm hm.Luke mumbled in her soft hair, his eyes closed.We could leave tomorrow if you want.Lenny added.Where do you wanna go?Luke was only half listening to her.Lenny didnt know.She didnt have a plan.She just had an impulse, a feeling, and acted on it.All she knew is she wanted to be with Luke, on another adventure.Just somewhere with you.Was all she could think of to answer.Ill go anywhere with you.Luke said slowly his voice rough with an emotion Lenny couldn't define.Luke didn't have a word for what he felt in her presence.He had known for a while now that Lenny was the one.His one.The one he wanted to be tangled up with forever.She was his exception.And he dared to hope he could be hers.15    Glycerine      It had been a long time since Duke had considered getting drunk.Years, in fact.But as he watched the coverage of Lenny flying high at the X Games, he thought about it.He sighed and clicked off the TV.It wasnt the fact that she was back, the center of a whirling media frenzy.It wasnt that she had just made his niece look like a chump.It was that kiss she had shared with the rock star.Duke didnt realize how much seeing something like that could hurt.He checked the clock on the wall, it was too early for bed and too late to go back out.He shoved himself into a standing position and made his way to the front door.Maybe a drive in the mountains would help clear his head.Being back on the tour was different for Lenny than it had been a few months ago.She couldnt run errands anymore because the anonymity was gone.Not only did the press know her name but they kept plastering her face all over everything.Carl was not pleased.He hadnt said anything to her but she knew by the look hed given her when they arrived in London that he was pissed.At least Im not cross eyed in this one.Lenny observed the cover of a paper tabloid they were passing around backstage at the venue.They didn't chill on the buses like before because they were rentals for the overseas tour and Carl was afraid theyd trash them.So during their down time they hung out backstage or in the hotel suite.I didnt think the last one was too bad, I mean, besides the face you were making.Mike joked dryly as Lenny passed him the magazine.Im sorry about that.Luke wouldnt stop apologizing.Lenny had told him that she was fine with it, it's not like she'd never been famous before.These were just different circumstances, the same rules applied.The media would hound you and try to find a reason to hate you and then move on when someone prettier or crazier came along.Dont worry so much.She waved it off.Really, its not that big of a deal.I don't forget important things, like underwear, when I leave the house.Im pretty boring, theyll move on eventually.Ten minutes, Carl stuck his head into the dressing room.The guys gathered themselves and headed for the stage area.Luke kissed Lenny lightly on the lips before leaving.She planned on waiting until they got situated before making her way through the crowd and joining Greg in the sound booth.She was getting ready to exit the dressing room when Carl stopped her.She reversed her trajectory as his imposing presence demanded to have a conversation.He shut the door behind him.Crossing his arms over his chest, he let out what Lenny could only assume was a snort.So how pissed are you?Lenny asked, her mouth ticking up on the side.I told you that under no circumstances were you allowed to sleep with any of them.His voice was restrained but the veins in his neck were pulsing at his pent up anger.He was more red than Lenny had ever seen him and she had a fleeting thought in regards to his heart health.Is that all your mad about?Lenny asked cautiously.That was the deal!Carl barked.Well, then we dont have a problem.Lenny said diplomatically, softening her features in an attempt to calm him down.What?Carl snarled with a glare.We havent slept together.Lenny stated matter of fact and stuck her hands in her pockets.What?Carl asked again with less roar.Carl, Im not like other girls, you should know that by now.Lenny said patiently, the same tone she had used on her father many times.Luke and I are not having sex.We havent had sex.And we arent planning on having sex.I have kept my word.Carl did a combination squint and grimace.He paced back toward the door and then back to Lenny.But you guys aretogether.Yes, Carl.Were dating.I like him and he likes me.I realize its unusual in this day in age for two people to just enjoy one another without getting naked but thats just how weird we are.Carl almost smiled.How long before?For crying out loud, Carl!Lenny exclaimed, Im not thinking about that and if I were I wouldnt discuss it with my boss.Carl, satisfied with her answer, moved to leave and he looked over his shoulder.Good to have you back, by the way.Lenny shook her head.That guy.She resumed her trek to the sound booth hoping she hadn't missed too much.The crowd was on its feet as the band played its opening song.Lenny slid into the sound booth and Greg gave her a cursory nod.She had missed this.The energy that reverberated between the band and the fans was breathtaking.The guys had warned Lenny that the overseas crowds were different than the ones Stateside.They were right.They were even crazier, if that was possible.Not an angry crazy or a dangerous crazy.It was more like their love for the music was completely uninhibited.In a word, it was beautiful.They hadnt had time to rehearse before flying into Heathrow and only had a small sound check that afternoon.But they were on.Lenny was continuously blown away by how effortless they made it all seem.Luke was magnetic on stage.The women literally threw themselves at him.Harrison kept kicking panties off the stage.Sway would sometimes grab a pair and hang them off the neck of his bass, but that only encouraged more throwing of undergarments.Lenny used to be amazed at the shamelessness of the women but now it didnt even phase her.It also seemed to not phase Luke.He never acknowledged the suggestive antics of his female fans.Lenny lost herself for a moment in the haze that was Luke Casey.She had never felt for anyone like how she felt for him.He was strong, dependable, sexy and all those things girls dream about in the perfect guy.But there were many other things that Lenny knew about him now that the rest of the world probably never would.Like, he also had this tiny scar behind his left ear that hed gotten when he was seventeen while he was windsurfing with Harrison in Malibu.And he got too emotionally invested in the contestants on reality shows.And he sang the wrong words to popular songs to make Lenny laugh.He didnt pretend to have it all figured out, he was constantly striving to make himself a better person.Somehow, amidst the insanity of being a hugely successful musician, he hadnt let the fame get to him.He was genuine and humble.In a world full of flakes, Luke Casey was the real deal.And for some reason that Lenny hadnt yet deciphered, he wanted to be with her.He didnt just like spending time with her, he acted like she was a vital part of his every day existence.And she felt the same about him.It was strange, she had never believed that Shane loved her, no matter how many times he said it.But she knew, without question, that Luke loved her.It was in everything he said and did, the way he talked to her, how he touched her, leaving no room for doubt.Lenny was afraid she had finally done what she said she wouldn't do, she had fallen in love with a rock star.No other explanation made sense for everything that was going on between them.It had become even more apparent to her at Aspen.He so willingly lent his strength to her to help her achieve things she hadnt done in years.Her heart hurt a little because she knew the tour would be over soon and things would change.She closed her eyes and tried to silence the scream that wanted to erupt from her lungs every time she thought about the coming end.How could she part with him?How could she say goodbye after they had come so far?The logical, realistic side of Lenny told her that this was always temporary, she should have guarded her heart better.But the romantic, idealistic side of Lenny wanted to hope that Luke would chase her home.They could get married and have fat babies.Maybe they could bring the whole family on tour and Lenny could compete in the off season.That could work, right?Reasonable Lenny said no.The tour would end and so would their affair.They would go home.Lenny to the mountains where she would begin training again for the Olympics.And Luke would go home to Boston and record a new album and forget all about her.That was always the plan, Lenny reminded herself.This was supposed to be about finding your way into a new life and moving on.Falling in love was never part of the plan.The set was over before Lenny realized it and they were almost finished with the encore.She chewed on the inside of her cheek, contemplating the inevitable.You okay?Greg interrupted her thoughts.What?Yeah.Lenny forced a smile and stood up.She exited the booth, making her way backstage as the band wrapped up their final song.Luke was descending the stairs and he saw her immediately.He scooped her up in a big hug, lifting her off her feet and making her smile.He brought her back to the earth slowly, being sure to kiss her deeply before letting go.You wanna get something to eat before going back to the hotel?Luke grabbed Lenny's hand and they started for the green room.Sure, what do you have in mind?She asked, enjoying the warmth of his hand against hers.Let's go on an adventure.Luke raised his eyebrows at her as he held the door open.I like that idea.She agreed and then laughed at his excited grin.No matter how much time they had left, she was going to enjoy every second of it.The thing with touring overseas is that Luke felt more like he was on vacation than on tour.They didn't have to sleep on the buses, they had fancy suites in hotels every night.The travel was all by private plane so they had more time to explore the cities and countryside.Plus, they still got to play sold out arenas every night.Each band member had a tendency to go a little wild and really enjoy themselves.Luke loved Europe.He'd split off from the guys and do his own thing, the whole time wishing he had someone he could share it with.Now, he had Lenny, he could share those things with her.He had taken her to a small pub that he had discovered many years ago on one of their first trips overseas.They ate some of the local cuisine and talked and laughed until way too late, finally making their way back to the top floor of the hotel.Stay with me tonight.He whispered in her ear after he had walked her to her door.He couldn't stand the thought of her staying in her room all alone.She was meant to be near him always.I don't mean in the same bed, just stay in our suite.He clarified, cupping her cheek in his hand and resting his forehead against hers.He could see the debate behind her sapphire eyes and he stepped back, letting his hands trail down her arms and rest at her fingertips.I'll be a perfect gentleman, you can have my room and I'll take the couch.It would be so much nicer waking up with you there instead of just Sway...I need a buffer with that guy sometimes.She smiled shyly, You make it really hard to follow the rules.Luke grinned, Then it's a yes?He raised one eyebrow at her.She sighed in pretend frustration.Yes.But I have to get my things and I want take a shower tonight before going to bed.She retreated to her room and Luke waited in the hallway.He was...giddy.He wasn't sure if he'd ever been giddy before, it was all very new.Everything with Lenny was new.Even after they had returned to his suite and explained to Sway that she'd be staying with them, Sway didn't seem surprised.It's like she just fit.Into every part of his life.When Lenny emerged from the bathroom she was showered, and dressed in shorts with a sponsor's logo and a t shirt with a faded Double Blind Study band script on it.Luke eyed the shirt thoughtfully as she took a seat next to him on the couch.Thats an old shirt, he observed.Lenny didnt respond so he added.I thought you said you didnt know who we were.Referencing back to the day they met.Lenny blushed, I lied.Ive always been a fan.Luke smiled and pulled her into his chest, resting his chin on top of her head.He didnt care how she had come into his life, just that she was there now.He could sense something was bothering her, it had been just below the surface all night.But he decided to wait for her to bring it up.She was in his arms now, and that meant she was safe.The sun began to peek through the cloudy skyline of the London backdrop and Lenny sipped her coffee from the couch.She had woken early, jet lag was confusing, and ordered room service.Luke woke up when the food came to the door and then headed to the shower right away.Lenny poured herself a cup of coffee and slipped into a melancholy repose.One more show in London tonight.Two more weeks is all they had left.After last night, the feel of a real date for them, Lenny was falling harder and faster.It wasnt enough.It would never be enough.She would never feel like shed gotten enough kisses.Or smiles.Or embraces.She could and would try to soak up as much of Luke Casey as possible in the next couple of weeks.But then what?She blinked back the sudden tears that threatened to overtake her.She couldnt imagine the days ahead without him.She sighed with frustration at herself.She should have never let anyone become such a necessity in her life.Nothing lasts forever.And while Luke Casey was her best friend today, in a month she would just be some girl he used to know.She should end it before the awkward conversation of the logistics came up.That would be horrible.It was bad enough that she knew it wasnt going to last, it would be worse to have him have to explain it to her like she was just another...groupie.She didn't think her heart could take that kind of a conversation.Good coffee, Sway startled Lenny out of her thoughts.She hadnt even noticed when he had joined her.Yeah, it's good.Lenny agreed, having a brief thought about making sure someone brought coffee to Carl.What were you thinking about?It looked deep.Sway asked.Juststuff.Lenny couldnt come up with anything she really wanted to share.Too many thoughts, not enough words.You feeling okay?Sway's eyebrows pushed together in concern.Yeah.Lenny forced a smile in his direction but didnt meet his eyes.Fine, why?Just asking.Sway wasn't buying it but he dropped it anyway.How come you're splitting the suite with Luke instead of it being Mike?Lenny changed the subject.Sway was never one to be insightful but she didn't need him suspecting her of anything and then telling Luke before she could tell him herself.Because Europe still turns Mike into a pussy and Harrison and Blake will be better at watching him than Luke.Sway twisted his face in annoyance.What do you mean 'better than Luke?'Lenny bristled.'Cause Luke's busy with you.Sway picked around the fruit on the food cart and glanced up to see Lenny's offended expression.Not that it's a bad thing.We all discussed it, it's the solution we came up with.Why does Mike have to be babysat?That's a little condescending, don't you think?Lenny said, knowing that that was what Carl had hired her for in the first place but still feeling the need to defend the drummer.Look, Sway tried again, Mike gets really emotional when we go overseas.He knows it, we know it.He has a lot of triggers here.London is where he met Ilsa.Sway stopped talking and looked up at Lenny.She nodded, silently confessing that she knew the private details of their quarrel, guilt washing over her again.He needs us to watch out for him, it's what brothers do.Sway settled on a large pastry and came back over to the couch.He sat down next to Lenny, his face serious and thoughtful.And Luke needs to be with you right now.Fresh tears started to form in the back of Lenny's vision and she swallowed hard.What do you mean?Her voice coming out raspy and thick.You guys are good for each other.And no one wants to get in the way of that.It's that simple.How is the sexiest girl in the world?Luke interrupted Lenny's stunned thoughts as he came into the room and bent low to kiss her on the lips.Im okay, kinda gassy.Sway replied, making Lenny and Luke laugh.I think it was that salmon I ate last night.That was salmon, right?He pretended to be embarrassed.Oh, you meant Lenny.Never mind.Im good, how did you sleep?Lenny looked into the most beautiful blue eyes in the world and her heartbeat quickened.His hair was still wet from his shower and he hadnt put his shirt on yet.She tried not to stare at the body that she was positive was cut from pure granite by the hand of God.Now stop that!She scolded herself internally.You have got to get a handle on yourself.Fantastic.Luke replied in a low voice as he leaned in for another kiss.Hey!Sway jumped in.Im sitting right here.He shook his head in mock disgust and got up for another cup of coffee.Sorry, man.Luke stared into Lennys eyes.I just cant get enough of her.Uh oh, here comes the jelly legs.Lenny could feel herself turning into mush, good thing she wasnt standing or walking, or holding something highly valuable.You guys need to just do it and get it over with.The sexual tension around here is unbearable.Lennys eyes widened at Sways words.Wow, Sway!Inappropriate much?Sway rolled his eyes.Luke slipped his t shirt over his head and pulled Lenny to her feet.He planted another perfect kiss on her lips.He moved his arms around her waist and started kissing her neck.Go get dressed, I want to take you around London today before the show.He murmured in her ear.Lenny hoped she could walk, she wasnt so confident in her knees ability to not buckle.She flashed him a smile and then hurried to change her clothes.Two weeks left, she wasn't going to waste it.As Lenny closed the door to the bedroom to get dressed Luke helped himself to the fruit on the table.Lenny was right, that was inappropriate, Luke rebuked Sway quietly.Cmon, you guys are constantly macking on each other and talking all cute and stuff.Just do it and get it over with.I dont know what youre waiting for.Sway grabbed an apple off the platter and examined it.I mean, I know Lennys special and blah, blah, blah but its beena while now.Youve never waited with any other girl before.He took a bite.I dont get it.Its not about that.Luke said, his mouth curving up slightly on the side.I love her.Ill wait as long as it takes.Whats that supposed to mean?Sway tried to ask around his mouthful, losing chunks of apple in the process.Shes the only one I want to be with ever again.I never want to be without her.Youre talking code, dude.Youre gonna have to explain to me.Sway's eyes went wide in exasperation.I dont want to have sex just because it seems like its time.Ive done that, it doesnt mean anything.Not this time.Shes the only one I ever want to be with in that way, for the rest of my life.Luke poured the hot coffee into an empty cup on the tray.Sway choked on his apple as he finally understood what Luke was saying.He gasped for air as he tried to ask a question but couldnt get around the chunk of apple lodged in his throat.Luke laughed at him and looked out the window at the London landscape.Yep.He confirmed Sways fears.Im gonna marry her.He smiled to himself and brought the coffee cup to his lips, I just have to figure out when and how to ask her.16    A Drop In The Ocean      It was as it had always been for Duke.Growing up the youngest of five kids, his siblings had left home long before he was born.He had been his parents surprise baby.Raised like an only child on the backside of the Ozarks, Duke had few friends and kept to himself.He enjoyed people and he wasnt shy by any means.He just didnt need people.And thats where he found himself again.Alone.His third long drive in as many days.He passed by the local tavern a couple of times and considered pulling into the parking lot.Maybe just feel the warmth of the neon for a few minutes, it didnt mean hed have to go inside.Hed shake off the feeling and continue driving.The drive was always the same.Long.Lonely.Unchanging.He never saw anything he hadnt seen a thousand times before.He passed all the same little cabins and no trespassing signs that had always been there.Now, it was starting to snow.Not regular snow.Big, thick, lazy snow.The kind that would pile into slush on the ground, quickly making driving conditions more treacherous.Duke turned the wipers on and peered into the gray.Up ahead he could almost make out a car pulled over on the side of the road.Its hazards were on but the falling snow was so think it was almost unnoticeable.Duke pulled in behind the small compact car, this was no place to have car trouble.It was a blind turn and with the weather, it was a tragedy waiting to happen.The plates on the little Ford said California.Figures, out of towners always think they can drive in the snow, Duke thought to himself.He set his brake and turned his own hazards on and got out of the old Bronco.As he approached the drivers side of the car he saw a woman talking on her cellphone.He tapped on the window, startling her.The windows were foggy and starting to frost on the corners from the cold.The woman held up her finger for Duke to wait and she slowly stepped out of the car.She was tall, Duke observed, for a woman.She was probably close to six feet because she was nearly eye level with him.She had raven black hair that easily reached her waist but was twisted into a loose braid that came over one shoulder.Her almond shaped eyes were a beautiful chestnut brown.She was stunning, to say the least.But her physical appearance isnt what caught Dukes eye first.It was the .45 pointed at his chest.Duke raised his hands slightly.He wasnt sure if she was being overly cautious or if she was going to rob him.Im waiting for a tow truck, you would do best to get back into your vehicle and be on your way.She spoke with authority and held the weapon like an experienced professional.Duke didnt want to argue.But it was in his nature.Nice Sig, He complimented her.He kept his hands raised.I just thought I might be able to help.He looked back up the road.Its a blind turn, someone might not see you.Ill be just fine.She spoke assuredly but Duke saw her swallow just a little too hard.Im in no mood to cause you any trouble, maam.Duke thought hed try one more time.He had a soft spot for stubborn women with guns...apparently.Did you call the Highway Patrol?He could see her mind working quickly behind those dark eyes.She nodded but didnt answer.You can call and confirm with them who I am.I live just a mile up the road, I help them pull cars out of ditches all the time.Id be glad to help you now, 'cause who knows when the tow truck will make it up here in this snow.Do you have ID?The woman asked, raising an eyebrow.Duke fished his license out of his back pocket and handed it to her.She gave him a hard look and then got back in her car and on the phone.She spoke for a few minutes to what Duke assumed was the local dispatch.She gave him a sideways glance out the window and nodded to whoever was on the phone.When she stepped back out of the car she had holstered her weapon somewhere Duke couldnt be sure but at least it wasnt pointed directly at him.How far can you tow me?She asked, handing back his ID.As far as you need, Duke replied.Ill need to get the car repaired in town, is there a mechanics shop?Yeah, Duke was headed to the Bronco to get his tow cables.You staying in town or do you need a lift back up here?Ill rent something and drive back up, thank you.She was definitely not a friendly lady, Duke thought.But his thoughts changed quickly when he saw her getting a bundle of blankets out of the backseat of her car.It was a child, maybe four years old, all tucked and rolled inside numerous blankets and afghans.Can we wait in your truck?She asked, her lips making a hard line on her face.No wonder she had been so quick to suspicion.She had precious cargo.Absolutely.Duke dropped his tow cables and helped her and the child into the warmth of the still running Bronco.He made sure they were buckled safely inside and then he maneuvered the Bronco to the front of her tiny car.Duke jumped out and quickly connected the tow cables, rigging everything securely.When he got back into the truck he tried to give her a reassuring smile.Were all set.He put the Bronco in gear and started slowly back down the mountain, paying extra close attention to his driving.Hed never transported kids before.He wasnt sure what would be an acceptable rate of speed.She still had that .45 somewhere and he really didnt need her pointing it at him while he drove.Are we going sledding, Mom?A little voice from the middle seat asked sweetly.Moms car broke so well have to go sledding tomorrow.The woman explained gently.Her tone was so different with her child that Duke had to look over to see if it was the same woman.Her face had softened as she looked at her son and Duke was caught off guard by her sweet smile.She looked up at him and they had eye contact briefly before Duke turned his gaze back to the road.What the hell was that?He reprimanded himself.Keep your eyes on the road, Duke.She has a gun.Who are you?The child asked Duke bluntly.He couldnt help but smile at the forthright question.His name is Mr.Dukane and hes giving us a ride to the place where we can get our car fixed.She explained to the boy.Duke had never been called Mr.Dukane before.Hed been Duke for as long as he could remember.She had gotten that off his ID.Actually, you can call me Duke.Its what everyone else calls me.He said with a grin to the boy.His eye caught hers again and he decided to wink.She's going to shoot me.Whats your name?Duke asked the boy, deciding not to steal anymore glances at the exotic beauty to his right.Im Tyler and Im four.Tyler said proudly.Pleased to meet you, Tyler.Duke said and then asked, Whats your moms name?Mom.Tyler responded making Duke chuckle.My name is Natalie.She replied with her own soft laugh.Yeah, Natalie.Tyler confirmed.Is this your truck?He inquired next.Yep, it sure is.Duke confirmed.He was liking how easy it was to talk to Tyler, way easier than talking to Tylers mom.It sure is big.Tyler said trying to peer over the dash.Then, Do you go sledding, Duke?Sometimes, Duke said with a small laugh.But I stand up on my sled.Thats not allowed.Tyler reported, You could get hurt.Thats true.Duke agreed, Sometimes I do get hurt.The conversation continued on like this for another thirty minutes as Duke carefully drove through the ever increasing storm.Tyler, obviously tired, snuggled up against his mother and the cab fell quiet again.Thank you.Natalie said, breaking the silence.Not a problem.Duke responded, Im just glad you didnt shoot me up there.He grinned at her impulsively.She smiled a little.It was a lovely smile.I couldnt take any chances.Natalie explained as she stroked her sons hair.Hes all I have.Duke wondered what she meant.He didnt want to cross the boundaries of the social norm but hed never been good at following those rules anyway.Wheres Tylers father?Duke blurted.It sounded awful as it spilled out of him but he couldnt take it back now.Maybe she would just shoot him after all.He died in Afghanistan three years ago.She answered with a touch of regret in her voice.Army?Duke asked.Marine, Natalie corrected.That explained the Sig.Im sorry, was all Duke could think of to say.He was a good dad.Natalie continued, Tyler wont ever remember him, but Ive never seen a man love his child the way Mark loved Tyler.So, its just you two against the world then.Duke said it as a statement more than a question.We do okay on our own.Natalie quietly defended.I have no doubt.Duke agreed.Ive never had a gun pulled on me for offering to help with a tow.He gave her a sideways grin.Sorry about that.She attempted to apologize but Duke stopped her.Dont you dare.He said sternly.More women should do exactly what you did.She turned her head to hide her smile but Duke saw it reflect on the window.So, you live around here?She changed the subject and Duke let her.Yeah, I live in this ugly lodge up in the mountains.She chuckled at his description and he felt warmth creep into his cheeks.He liked making her laugh.So Duke didnt want to come across as a creeper but he wanted to know if he should be aware of any other men in her life before he proceeded with his train of thought.Do you have a boyfriend or fianc or anything?Ha!Natalie laughed again.That was real subtle.She was smiling openly now.Im not good with women.Duke muttered, embarrassed at his actions.He knew he had just blown it.No.Natalie snickered.The answer to your question is no, there is no one like that in my life.She looked down at her sleeping child.I dont have time for any of that.Most guys arent looking for a package deal anyhow.Duke considered her words, not totally sure what she meant.Guys didnt like her because she came with a kid?That was shallow.And stupid.Why are you in Wyoming?He decided to ask instead.We needed to get away and Tyler had never seen snow before.My dad owns a cabin in the mountains.I havent been up here since I was a little girl, I dont even know if the cabin is livable.She confessed at the end.Well, if you were looking for snow, you came to the right place.Duke said, pulling into the parking lot of the best mechanic in town.Whos your dad?He asked thoughtfully, he knew pretty much everyone in the area.Colonel Henry Clay.Duke whistled under his breath.I know that cabin.Thats a sweet piece of property.Has he had anyone taking care of it?Im not sure, Natalie responded.Dad passed away last year and left the cabin to me.I thought now would be a good time to check it out.She rolled her eyes at herself.Smart, in the middle of winter.Duke had parked the Bronco and now he leaned back in his seat and rubbed his short beard thoughtfully.Well, its still early enough in the day.Let me go in and get Earl started on your car and then Ill drive you up there and take a look over it myself.He saw her hesitate and quickly added.If you dont mind, that is.Im a pretty good handy man.He saw her mind working swiftly.She was as smart as she was beautiful.If she thought he was still a threat she would turn him down, but Duke didn't see it going that way.Besides, if he tried anything, she could just shoot him.Thanks, Shawn.She smiled, the warmth of it making Duke blush under his beard again, Id really appreciate that.Duke grinned and jumped out of the truck.He jogged into Earls, unable to hide his delight.No one had called him by his first name in a long time.He liked the way it sounded.It made his heart beat just a tad bit differently.The rest of the European tour was a blur for Lenny, it went entirely too fast.In every city, Luke had something he wanted to share with her.He was excited and energetic, showing her all the little shops and non touristy attractions that were his favorite.She giggled at his antics and thrill for the adventure.They hardly spent any time with the other band members anymore, they were nearly always alone.Lenny couldnt tell if it bothered the guys, they hadnt said anything.She only half cared.The days were flying by and she wasnt going to miss a single second with Luke.Her attitude became one of passionate desperation.She absorbed every word, every smile, and every kiss.She tried to memorize the lines in his hands and how the calluses on his fingertips felt against her cheek when he would touch her face.And before Lenny could be satisfied, the tour was done.They were on a plane bound Stateside, decompressing and relaxing.They talked of the successful shows, the fantastic reviews, the sold out performances.Carl was more at ease than Lenny had ever seen him.He pulled his ball cap down low over his eyes and fell fast asleep.Ever diligent, Luke was already discussing the next album.Where should they record?Who should they go with for a producer?What kind of vibe should they try to capture?It was all very interesting and Lenny tried to keep up with as much of the lingo as she could.She had a pressing in her heart that she was trying to ignore.Luke still hadnt talked about them and she was afraid it was because he didnt know how.She could broach the subject.After all, it was on her mind.What if he changed?What if he shut down and pulled away and got cold?Lenny didnt think she could bear it if Luke started to treat her differently.She felt foolish for feeling that way.Shed never been in love before, she had no idea what to do with it.Especially in circumstances like this, where her reality and her ideal were complete opposites.She thought about telling Luke that she loved him.He hadnt said it since his outburst at Ashton.That was okay because Lenny didnt really want to have to say I love you, too.She just wanted to say it.Without requirement or expectation.So he would know there were no stipulations.She simply loved him.But the timing always seemed off, and she didnt want it to come out forced or trite.Of course, the next fear was that he didnt feel the same.Based on the things he said, how he acted and treated her, Lenny knew in her heart he loved her.Shed known since the first moment they kissed.But rock stars fall in love all the time, she reminded herself.Thats how they make such great music.Sway saw the small interaction between Lenny and Luke.It was subtle but perfect.The guys were thrilled with Lennys presence in their lives.They didnt care that Luke had taken to spending every waking moment with her.She was good to him and he deserved that.When Luke had told Sway he was planning on marrying the girl, Sway had been stunned at first.But as he considered their relationship, it fit.Sway had never been in love.Sure, hed made a lot of what looked like love.But hed never felt for one person the way Luke obviously felt for Lenny.And they hadnt even slept together.It blew Sways mind.And yet, as he watched them together, it made perfect sense.Harrison and Blake were arguing not so quietly about what they think shouldve happened on their favorite daytime soap opera.It kind of distracted Lenny from her fear of flying closer to good bye.She quietly laughed at their antics and felt a lump rise in her throat.She would miss them.All of them.Not just Luke.She would miss Blake and Harrison's petty arguments and ridiculous capers.She would miss Sway asking her to help him with his flyaways and split ends.She would miss Mikes dry humor and his ability to anticipate the next step.She would miss Carls crankiness and ranch foreman mentality.She leaned her head against the back of the seat.She was going to have serious withdrawal after she left these guys.She wondered who would take her place for the next tour.Would they treat them as good she would?Would they follow Carls guidelines and put the band first?Would they fall in love with the lead singer?Lenny couldnt handle anymore thoughts.She squeezed Lukes hand instinctively and closed her eyes.Maybe she would feel better about her plan after she had gotten some sleep.Luke felt the gentle pressure on his hand and frowned slightly at Lennys resting posture.Her eyes were closed but her face wasnt relaxed.She appeared to be thinking hard, trying to will sleep to happen.He wondered what was bothering her.Well, it had been a long trip, Luke decided.She was probably just tired.The plane landed in New York and they had a two hour layover before their next flight to Boston.The guys napped in the waiting area, jet lag was a bitch.Lenny was kind of surprised that there was a ticket for her to Boston as well and not somewhere further west.She assumed it was Carl and decided that Boston would be as good as any place to say goodbye.The flight was fast, only an hour, from LaGuardia to Boston.Lenny barely had time to collect her thoughts.As they were disembarking, she knew what she had to do.She tapped into that special feature in her brain that she reserved for competitions.She shut everything out and took a deep breath.The wall came up, separating her from her surroundings.She had a mission, and it was time to execute.They were at baggage claim and Lenny waited for the guys to gather in a huddle around her.No one noticed that her bags hadnt arrived.They naturally gravitated toward her and she waited till she had their attention.Im going home.She said plainly, her tone gentle.She didnt want to hurt them but someone needed to rip the Band Aid off.Shed already gotten a connecting flight that would have several stops before she reached home.All she had to do was catch her next flight.What do you mean?I thought you were going to Lukes house.Harrisons eyes were already starting to water.Lenny loved his tender heart, he didnt like change.I was not aware of that plan.Lenny looked to Luke but his eyes had lost focus.The reality had hit him.
