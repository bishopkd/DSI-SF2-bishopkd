Nice.It wasnt until Owen was sure Virginia Stiles had exited the hallway that he rolled his cart to the service elevator.Logic would have dictated Owen take the elevator to the top floor and work his way down, but Owen hit the button for the third floor.He exited the elevator and rolled his way past the accounting department.He placed a bundle of mail on Allisons desk.Allison was the accounting departments secretary.Hey, Owen, Allison said, half a frosted donut clutched in her pudgy, manicured fingers.A bunch of us are going over to Jigglys after work.Interested?I dont think so, Owen replied.Jigglys was a Hooters style bar, and the waitresses aggressiveness was intimidating to Owen.Plus, there was the issue of Jigglys signature feature, the Interrogation Room.Aw, cmon, Allison said.Itll be fun.Beer, wings, and laughs.You should come out with us.Without looking up, Owen replied, Maybe.Well see.Owen rolled his cart down the hall.He rolled his cart past the ficus that needed watering, past the water cooler whose very proximity no doubt tortured the ficus, and down to the gray steel door at the end of the hall.He knocked first, waited, and then opened the door.Bree wasnt in the room.Owen picked up the bundle of mail addressed to Bree Estelle.She sure went away a lot on business.Owen guessed that was a perk of being the niece of the boss lots of travel.Sighing, he shut the door.Turning around, he ran right into Virginia Stiles, who had managed to sneak up on him over the heel muffling industrial carpet.Oh my God, she has the greenest eyes!Owen quickly looked down.Youre fond of my niece, arent you Owen?Excuse me?Its okay.Bree is quite attractive.She gets lots of suitors.Im sorry, Ms.Stiles, Owen sputtered.I didnt mean to be presumptuous.Oh, Owen, Virginia Stiles said as she settled a hand on the front of his collared shirt, dont be ridiculous.Her palm slid down toward his pocket, and she cupped his flabby chest.Bree doesnt like the fatties, though.Just a word of advice.You look like you once were in shape, dear.I used to swim in high school, Owen replied, torn between wanting to wriggle away from Ms.Stiles touch yet not wanting to offend.You should get back to that, Virginia Stiles said.Youd have a better chance of turning Brees head that way.She removed her hand and started to turn away, but then paused and added, The gym on the first floor has a spin class at five fifteen.Its free for all employees.Think about it.I have to get home after work, Ms.Stiles, Owen said.But thank you.As you wish, Owen.Ill tell you, thoughBree never misses a spin class when shes in town.It might be something youd have in common.Virginia Stiles strutted away down the hall.Carry on!she said with a wave of her hand.Bree took spin class?Sweet Bree.Owen pondered the possibilities as he rolled his cart back up the hall.In his pocket, his cell phone buzzed.Owen took it out and looked at it.His mother.Owen wasnt supposed to answer his phone while delivering the mail, but no one could see him in this hallway.He answered it and whispered a hushed hello.OWEN.WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?Im not supposed to answer my phone at work Ma.You know that.NOT EVEN WHEN ITS YOUR MOTHER CALLING AND ITS AN EMERGENCY?Whats the matter Ma?I NEED YOU TO PICK UP TWO PERCENT MILK, A QUART, AND BUTTER AND CIGARETTES ON YOUR WAY HOME.Okay, Ma, Owen said.I will.See you later.DONT FORGET.YOU FORGOT LAST TIME.I wont, Ma, Owen replied.Tucking the phone back in his tight pocket, Owen looked back once more at the gray steel door at the end of the hallway.Sweet Bree.My sweet Bree.
