 Manolo, Jess called out, dont worry about the pool house today.The two oclock sun cast a glare off the smooth pool surface that made it hard to see Manolo over by the pool house.Yes, maam, Manolo replied.He turned back from the accessory building, picked up his equipment, and proceeded to vacuum the pool bottom.Nearer to where Jess lay, she could see him better.Uck, Jess thought, I am NOT a maam!Jess pulled at the gauzy wrap that covered her from the waist down.The wrap made her feel overheated on this gorgeous sunny day, but there was no way Jess was going out in the yard without a wrap on.Maam!Clearly, she needed it.Wasnt it was bad enough being a thirty eight year old woman with a boatload of body issues without the pool boy calling her maam?Jess sipped at her Virgin Bloody Mary and tried not to be obvious while watching Manolo work.He wore a cropped tee with the sleeves cut off.The shirt was dirty, stained with sweat and soil.Filthy, slimy, and grimyJess found it sexy as hell.Manolos long days spent in the summer sun, plus his naturally dark skin, gave him the bronze radiance of a Latin god.His short black hair was a blessing there was nothing to block the view of his pronounced cheekbones and chocolaty eyeballs.Manolo had the eyes of a basset hound deep and soulful.Add in the gym shorts and sandals and ooh lah lah Jess wished the pool needed vacuuming more often.Come on.Look over here.Notice me.Nothing more.Just notice me.Thats all I ask.Not much.I want to feel worth noticing.Jesss shades hid the movement of her eyes, or lack thereof, as she watched Manolo manipulate the long pole.Jess was always careful to point her head in a different direction, to avoid detection.Manolo never knew at least Jess hoped so.But someone did.A shadow obscured Jesss sun, and Jess bolted up and spilled tomato juice on her bosom.Anthony!was her first thought, even though it was too soon for him to be home from work, if you could call busting heads work.Was that work?No.Anthony enjoyed busting heads too much for it to be work.Hells knells, Jess heard a familiar female voice say.Tense up much?Oh, thank GodNOT Anthony!Jess finally exhaled, her stomach unknotting.Jess looked up and saw the source of the shadow was her friend and neighbor, Isabella.Despite the hot afternoon sun, Isabella was wearing layer upon layer of black some lace, some cotton and enough beads to buy the isle of Manhattan.Hey, Isabella, Jess said.Just lost in thought.Isabella, popping her ever present gum, glanced over at Manolo and sat down on the chaise lounge next to Jesss.Lost in thoughts of your tall, dark, and brown pool man, I bet.Isabella grinned that wide goofy grin she sported when she teased.She sported that grin a lot.No, Jess lied, dabbing at the tomato juice on her chest with a paper napkin.You know hes gay, right?Isabella asked.He is not!Jess said.Those muscles, and his strut no!Youre wrong.Then again, he was extremely well groomed for a pool man.Bi, maybe, but not gay.Well, Isabella said, lets ask.Hey, Manolo!Are you?Jess reached out and pinched Isabellas leg.Isabella squealed and said, Are you too hot today?Manolo told her he wasnt and kept at his work.Oh yes he is, Isabella whispered.Jess pinched her again.Youre teasing me, Jess said.Isabella plopped her massive tote bag down on the paver patio and rubbed her thigh.I am teasing you, but he is gay.Stop saying that, Jess said.Isabella had no internal censor.Words like gay came out of her mouth full steam, and not whispered, like they should be.If Anthony heard you The apes not home, is he?Isabella asked, her eyes darting to the house.No, my husband isnt home, Jess replied, and then whispered, but you know how he gets all bashy when a gay person is around.Its not safe to even joke about.Isabella exhaled.Youre married to a caveman, and Im glad hes not here.Id hate to cut into you two lovebirds wooing time.Pffft, Jess said.
