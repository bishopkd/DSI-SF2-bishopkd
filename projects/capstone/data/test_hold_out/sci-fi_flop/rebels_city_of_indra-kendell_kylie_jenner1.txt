   The light broke through the surface.Twenty feet tall and armed with bits the size of a man, the drill engines had been running continuously.Andru read the depth sensors and knew that the end was nearly in sight.Already his crew had broken two more drill bits as they clawed their way upward, covered in dirt and ash and dust and clay.The last two engines carried on, alternating running times to stave off overheating.Even this close, closer than any had been in the thousand years since the world went dark, the heat pooled and sweltered.Andru oversaw the engines running when his team needed rest.He found that he had no need for sleep.It had been five days since he last laid his head down, and it remained that way no more than an hour.Hed been woken by a breeze, fresh air traveling through an unseen vent.The first taste of fresh air in his life.Hed lived beneath the earth for too long.He would wait no longer.His crew were loyalists, committed men whod left their families to give them better lives.None of them had ever met anyone whod survived the Great Catastrophe, and they were no longer sure just how long they were supposed to live beneath the crust, without questioning the world that could be reclaimed above.Generations and generations had carved out communities beneath the earth and grown pale and weak sighted.Generations upon generations had inherited the conditions wrought by the Great Catastrophe and the evils it had created.Humanity had been left behind, and there was no longer hope.Even the tales of former earth lost their wonder.Andru was not like the rest.Once hed salvaged and repaired the engines for his expedition, Andru petitioned the council to arm and feed his men.They gave him enough to gamble on the dream he sold, but not nearly enough to truly believe in it.Even his brother had tried warning him off his journey, but Andru couldnt quit his stubbornness.And that is why he also left his wife and son and daughter behind, promising to come back when he finally had sky overhead.He wrapped them in his arms and kissed them all good bye, then left to assemble his men.Most thought his pursuit of the overworld mortally foolish, but Andru thought the same of their willingness to war with each other, splintered factions fighting over dwindling supplies and inhabitable caverns.They would continue killing each other down below until none were left.The drill engine pounded at the stone, and Andru persisted through its unrelenting assault.The light overhead was no more than the size of a fist and yet it was glorious, though it hurt his eyes.He pulled his goggles on and watched to his satisfaction as it grew larger.Many of his men had died along the way.From cave ins and blasting explosions.From toxic exposure to unknown elements and collapsing lungs and vicious attacks from what had once been their own people.Andru was not without blood on his hands.Sacrifice.Each man had agreed to his part, knowing that their pilgrimage to the world beyond afforded a better life than what below could ever give.Sacrifice themselves and reclaim the ruined land for a new future.He heard the rock fracture and crack and his men yell as it fell upon the drill engine.Its operator was killed instantly.The light grew brighter.He couldnt allow his mens faith in him to falter.He stepped up and manned the last remaining engine himself.If more were to die, then he would be next.He had taken but a mere moments rest, still seated in the running engine.He wiped the sleep from his eyes, touching the beard that had grown so wildly that his own wife wouldnt recognize him.Thoughts of her and his children kept him sane.Had it been a year since he last saw them?No.Not that much.It couldnt have been....He drank enough to wet his mouth and wash the grit from it when one of the spotters came running.For him to have deserted his post ...something was terribly wrong.As the spotter came closer, Andru could see blood streaming from his face, and even worse, an eye missing.His shouts were unintelligible and panicked.Andru hopped down, the engine still firing into the world above.He waved one of his men in to replace him, even as wild calls rose from the darkness beyond the camp.Gear up!Andru shouted.Theyd escaped being attacked since the surface had been broken, and hed hoped ...His hope was foolish.He could show them only through action that testing his might was immensely foolish.There were almost two dozen of his crew remaining, minus the spotter with the savaged eye.In their hands they held metal bars and pikes.Andru hefted his sledge in two hands.It was still stained with the blood of the last pack whod thought his men would be easily broken.Did they not know that his men had broken earth itself?And yet, they werent prepared for the force of men who flooded their camp, perhaps three, even four times the size of his crew.It just meant more for his sledge, which he swung now with unmatched resolve and felt a mans skull give way.Yet these men who attacked were not savages, or mutants, marred by pollution and interbreeding.Atros?He saw the man who he once called brother knife a grunt of no more than sixteen cycles.More of his men died around him, as Andru continued to swing his sledge, breaking bone whenever it landed.His arms cried through the strain.The drill engine hammered away.By the time Atros and his men took the camp, theyd left only three men alive, but wounded.All three would surely die.None could remain to remember the truth of the attack.Andru was forced to kneel at Atross feet.The drill engine was now silent, its operator killed in his chair.Why?Andru asked, his mind reeling, betrayed by his own people.His own brother.The world will not be yours, Atros said.It will be greater than that.Know that your journey was not in vain.Your plans will continue, but you will not see them through.And then, looking into his brothers eyes, Andru was killed, a knife passed across his throat, and he slumped over as the life left his body and soaked into the earth.He cast his eyes upward with the last of his energy at the broken ground, a gust passing through it to cool his face, and finally he saw the sky and the hard won heavens above.1           Countdown to Emergence Ball: Day Before   Livia   Im breaking the rules, and I absolutely refuse to care.Veda gallops through the floating gardens and whinnies ecstatically as we pass the last of the designated security posts.Each gallop takes us farther and farther away from the main quarters, and closer to where the island ends and the clouds begin.For a moment, I forget Im virtually a prisoner.I can leave this island, but not unsupervised.And even then, there is little Im allowed to see, especially what lies below.Back in the main quarters, Governess will go to wake me from my rest.Shell be displeased at my unexpected absence, to say the least, with so many tasks yet to be done: final gown mods, vitamin injections, rosebud cheek infusions, last minute blemish inspection and evulsion.Then there is practice.There is always practice.The curtsy: low, but not unladylike.The conversation: pleasant, but not probing.There are fan drills to rehearse.The art of fan communication is delicate, this Ive been endlessly taught.An incorrect flick of the wrist, a hereafter with a man I despise.Expand the fan wide to indicate interest.Tap his shoulder to flirt.Right hand: I am available.Smack closed: I daresay we are incompatible.I plan on using that last one a great deal.The guest list must be memorized, ranked in order of importance.There are more insults to perfect, not to mention an inhuman amount of grooming.Tomorrow is the most important day of my life, after all.Ive been told it so much Im starting to believe it and fear it.Keep going, I tell Veda.The rhythmic thumps of her hooves grow faster.A frenzied, unrestrained drumbeat.My mother loved music just as I do.She spent entire days on her air harp, her fingers dancing along its cords, weaving songs while painting her studio with colorful beams of light.My mother, according to Governess, was a charming conversationalist and graceful dancer.Governess tells me all about my mother, and she often repeats herself.There is only so much to tell.Only so many stories.I know that she designed her own formal wear, and enjoyed berries and chocolate after dining.That she favored the color blue, and wore one long braid down her back unless the occasion dictated a more formal updo.I know a great deal about my mother, and yet nothing at all.A sudden rush of cold smacks me across the face, the air off the clouds growing stronger.Faster, I tell Veda.I pass the hedge maze and Tranquillity Pastures.Roar underneath the welcoming gate.Not that anyone is really welcome.Not to Helix Island.I want to go faster than I ever have.Farther than I ever thought possible.Now, Governess will have gone from displeased to frantic.This is worse than skipping penmanship, worse than rolling my eyes when one of the debutees expresses her unfortunate opinion during Etiquette Training.Why cant you just try?asks Governess when Im reported for impropriety.Cant you put forth the tiniest bit of effort?What she will never understand: not saying those things takes a lot of effort.This is the farthest I have gone without a chaperone.Beneath me, Veda snorts with elation, and fear.Dont be afraid, girl, I say.I hold my own fear tight, letting it surge through my body and push me farther.When Im found, Waslo will be informed.He is sure to engage me in a Discussion.Waslo Souture was my fathers protg.My father had friends as well, though I havent met any.They have good reason to keep their distance from the legacy he left behind.I cant imagine Waslo was ever a friend to my father.A most talented student, I cant deny, for his ascent into the Independent High Council is praiseworthy.If thats the sort of thing youd like to do with your life.Waslo has been around for as long as I can remember.There have also been Discussions as long as I remember.Perhaps he will choose Respect for the Family Name or Appropriate Behavior as a Reflection of Upbringing.Those classics I have committed to memory.Waslo grows especially passionate nearing the end of Appropriate Behavior; sometimes even a little spittle catches on his bottom lip.No, those are not suitable enough.Not for an offense this bold.For this, he will choose Being a Proper Young Woman.A Proper Young Woman would never dishonor her legacy in such an inappropriate manner, he will say.And on the eve of your Emergence Ball, at that!What would your father think?I wish I knew, I will think but never dream of saying.Instead, I will stay silent, head bowed in shame, waiting for him to finish.Hoping his spit doesnt find purchase farther than his thin lips.I will feel inadequate, just as he intended.Perhaps this is why Waslo is so important: he has a gift for making others feel unsatisfactory.This will be our last Discussion, I suppose.In a few hours, I will reach my seventeenth year of life.Tomorrow is my Emergence Ball; within the week I will have a cohabitant.Shortly after, I will be relocated to my cohabitants island or, as is done in some cases, he will come to live on Helix.And then we will officially, as The Book of Indra tells us, embark upon the journey of becoming Proper Cohabitated Citizens of Indrithian Society.Waslo shouldnt fret so much; soon I will be someone elses problem.Strangely enough, the thought makes me laugh, hard enough to shift across Vedas bare back.I cant help but regard my laughter as highly unbecoming.But I do it anyway.I shake the pins from my head, letting my hair fall against my shoulders, allowing the wind to whip it into tangles, and surge forward.Proper Young Women of the New Indrithian Society are happy to practice elocution and become versed in etiquette.They will memorize flower sonnets, never questioning that real flowers have not existed for centuries.Once flowers even had a scent, like perfume.There were more strains than we have selected to synth.Im sure grass must have smelled wonderful as well, not like the synth fields Veda tramples with each stride.Synth is as close to the former earth as Indras finest scientists can replicate, but it will never be truly real.I often wonder if anything is in Indra.Proper Young Women of the New Indrithian Society understand that penetrating questions are unnecessary.Curiosity is rude.Proper Young Women need not think beyond the gift of each magical Indrithian day: the lovely blooming of the synth trees, the filtered air, and purified water.Best not dwell below, the old saying goes.Or as written in The Book of Indra, Unpleasant topics bring about unpleasant feelings, so why ever broach such subjects?I cannot help myself.I want to question everything.I want to rip off my sashes and shriek like a hellion.I want to roll in the grass and soil my spotless white frock.Nothing is more pointless than a white gown.Its like telling the world you are incapable of interaction.Im not normal, I think.Or, at least, Im not like anyone else.When they find me, Governess will sputter and cry, Your happiness is my sole reason for existence.Needless to say, I will apologize profusely.I will play at embarrassment, put the fault on my nervousness, willingly submit myself to her itinerary of torture.Even better?I will pin the blame on heartbreak.My impending cohabitation means leaving you, dear Governess.You are the closest I have ever had to a mother.That should quiet her quickly.Strangely enough, the sentiment is true.I often wonder how she felt, after all those years of training, for the High Council to assign her to an orphan.An impossibly strange one at that.An odd little girl who, when choosing her leisure pastime as a child, insisted on swordsmanship.Not social dancing or needlepoint, as practiced by the highest ranks.I would wager Governess has regretted her assignment every day since.But doesnt she see the respect with which I hold my zinger?With every slash it barks.In the hands of a skilled swordsman, it would weave dangerous melodies.The more adept, the more sophisticated the song.The dissonant chorus of my practice must haunt her waking moments.Cant she imagine the songs it will one day sing?Raising me cannot have been an easy task, but tomorrow is the day Governess has been planning since my infancy.My birth into the social stratosphere, my official welcome into the realm of Indrithian Citizens of Importance ...and I am off riding Veda.My Emergence Ball will be spectacular, and that is all that matters.As for me?Im more of a gilded centerpiece to be admired.Im Livia Cosmo, the Orphan Airess.Living, breathing memorial to the great Armand Cosmo.My father was a true Indrithian of Importance.Before he died.The dead are never as important.My mother is at his side.Im the only one who remembers them.And yet, I have no memories of them.Im not sad.I never knew them.You cannot miss something you never had in the first place.Orphans are rare in Upper Indra.In fact, I believe Im the only one.Life expectancy is long here.Citizens are limited to a single progeny per cohabitation.This is how it has always been: father, mother, and child.A child on their own?An orphan?Who would look out for such a thing?Who would show it care?Veda is an anomaly, too.Horses have not existed for centuries, but my father successfully bred them in his labs.The colts were pitch black, and none survived very long.Only a solitary mare.Most refer to Veda as white, but theyre mistaken.Veda is ivory.And that is altogether different.No one knows how long she will live, but I do not worry.No one knows what to expect from me either.Veda belonged to my mother, and now she is mine.And she has never run faster.What I know: my father was the most famous geneticist of Indra.He worked in the City of Indra, where the Middler population is trained from birth to serve those of us on the Islands.My father had Middlers at his beck and call, perhaps even wiping his backside after a visit to the privy if he so demanded, which I very much hope he did not.My father was that important.According to Governess, Im an Indrithian of Importance as well.I inherited the Armand Cosmo legacy.Too bad I wont understand a word of it.Life Guide refuses to instruct me in genetics.I excel at every other subject, especially mathematics.I solved proofs and deciphered evolutionary patterns before Life Guide even taught me how.But still, genetics are too advanced, he says.But what about the test?I ask him.The one the High Council administered when I was little?The results said I have an aptitude for genetics.A gift.Life Guide pretends not to have heard me.If I persist, he claims that Im remembering incorrectly.I have a flawless memory.Just like her father!That is what Waslo exclaimed when he heard the results, my memory is clear.She is like him, he said, looking down at me with shiny eyes half filled with wonder, half with fear.I wish to understand the secrets in our cells, the mysteries of the blood that beats within our flesh.We all exist as one, but forever apart.Did my father even know this?I want to know all that he knew, and more.Instead, Life Guide and I study Indrithian history, to marvel at our great society and its innovations and advancements.Mostly we study The Book of Indra.Best not dwell below, Life Guide cites when I ask a question he wishes not to answer.What he means: learn what you are told to learn.Close your mouth and memorize a flower sonnet.Sometimes I think he doesnt know the answers himself.Sometimes I think the answers are all he knows.In my fathers time, genetics research was of the utmost importance.Population control, ensuring sufficient air and water supply for every Indrithian.The EX2 pill was his creation.I have taken my daily supplement since I turned twelve, as has every other Proper Young Woman.When I am cohabitated, I will discontinue my daily dosage, conceive my single offspring, and resume my daily EX2 pill after the birth.Except for the small human creature growing within me for nine months, everything will remain exactly the same.Perhaps its good were only allowed one.I can barely manage myself.Due to my father and the EX2 pill, the population is suitably controlled.Indra thrives.Now genetic research and implementation have evolved into something else entirely.Geneticists specialize in enhancements: dimple insertions, skin replenishment, skeletal adjustment.Nothing that changes the world, just your appearance.Governess begged me to get a chest alteration before the party season.No need to inflate for the whole evening, she confided.Only your debut entrance.And perhaps for the formal dinner.I refused again and again, and she would sigh dramatically, whole body crumpling as though I had stabbed her with my zinger.Governess believes in enhancements with the same intensity she believes in perfectly tied waist sashes.Her own face ceased changing when she began her yearly visits to the Rejuvenation Island Clinic.You could not discern her age unless you noticed the dullness in her eyes.She has yet to have the sparkle put back in, which is a very painful procedure.Up here in the upmost of Upper Levels, we have everything we could possibly want for, according to Governess, who never fails to want for an opinion.Unfortunately, this doesnt include an actual person with whom I can have an actual conversation.Life Guide doesnt count.Master comes once a week to oversee my swordsmanship, and he doesnt count either.I have never visited the City of Indra, and the only Middlers I know are the maids appointed to scour the endless white surfaces of the main quarters, and the garden crew that reprograms the synth trees to bloom for new seasons.Their leaves are gold and red and orange now.Last year Governess chose white blossoms.I thought much the same of them as of my white dress.This year they grew apples.They look far better than they taste.Veda neighs nervously.Im getting closer to the edge.Keep going, girl, I tell her.My Emergence Ball will be the biggest of the season.Everyone will be there, desperate to see Helix Island up close.Desperate to see my inadequacy up close as well.And the Proper Young Men of Indrithian Society?They will line up to cohabitate with the Cosmo Airess.I will be forced to pick one of themthats how its done.Thats how its always been done.The air grows chilly.The clouds draw closer.Veda comes to a sudden halt.Weve reached the edge.Nowhere else to go.I gaze up at the dome that keeps us all protected.It is far above and faint, but Im always aware of it.It is what keeps us from burning with radiation.I gaze down.The floating islands glide through the clouds beneath me, caught in their predictable orbits.Theyre beautiful from afaryou can almost imagine each is a slice of paradise, but must paradise feel so limited?For a moment, in the space between, I see the bottomless City of Indra, the twin towers of the High Council rising above all others.There is so much glass that its hard to look at directly, the way it refracts the suns light.It all looks as if it could be broken so easily, yet it has stood for centuries.Behold Indra: city of impossible architecture, her beauty timeless, her secrets dark.Whose mind dreamed her to life?For a split second, I imagine leaping into the sky and falling into the endless, unknown Indrithian void.Past one of the construction rigs, the crew of Hubbers astonished at my falling form, distracting them from island maintenance for a mere moment....The feeling I get is exactly like experiencing an Emergence Ball.Falling into an endless, unknown social void....Veda senses something.She backs us up.I shift her so we face Helix Island.My home, though not for much longer, if everything, unfortunately, goes according to the very well thought out and endlessly practiced plan.I will return to the main quarters and apologize to Governess.Tomorrow I will open my fan wide and curtsy low but not too low.I shall smile at each of the Proper Young Indrithian Men as though they are the most fascinating Young Men in existence, and then I will choose one with which to spend the rest of my life.At least its my choice, right?In that moment, I feel something boiling to the surface of my skin.This part of me I cannot control.This part is not only improper but something far worse.Dangerous.I give Veda a squeeze with my heels, and we gallop toward an enormous tree.On its branches hang the last of the apples.Were going faster now, the wind blowing through my hair.When were practically flying, I draw the zinger from the sheath on my back.I swing as we race, cutting through the air, and the blade releases a few notes.The sound rises, growing angrier and more distorted.I hold the blade steady, the feedback disrupting the islands well preserved harmony.I pull myself to standing, balanced upright on Veda as she races forward, just as a burst of melody emerges from my zinger.Not a song, but closer than Ive ever gotten.In the split second, we race under the tree and I launch into midair.I land where I started: sitting safely on Vedas back.Veda halts.As Im catching my breath, she turns.Beneath the tree looms a tall figure in white.Master.I dont have swordsmanship today.Whys he here?Is he constantly watching?Are others?He bends down, picking up an apple from the ground.He holds it out to me in his open palm, gives it a slight twist.The apple falls into two perfectly cut halves.Livia, he says.We do not damage nature.We do not kill what grows.But it isnt real, Master.Nothing here is real.Excerpted from The Book of Indra,  VII: The Archives: A Universe of Wonderment  The Archives are a gift to Indrithian Society.Accessed via wrist implant, entering the Archives can be easily mastered by both child and adult.A fully immersive environment, these Archive experiences range in nature and are entered via access chips.As for your memory Archives, they are stored on an individualized chip assigned to each Indrithian citizen by the High Council at childhood.From replications of historical events preGreat Catastrophe and

is free of distraction.The Archives can be accessed from any location, though many prefer to do so in the comfort of an Archive access center.Archive access centers are located throughout Upper Indra, the City of Indra, and the HCP Hub.(For a complete listing of locations, see appendix LXIV. )Administer two quick, firm taps to the wrist to circulate the blood.Insert Archive access chip into left wrist slot.Quickly place thumb tip to pulse point.Once thumbprint has been matched, DNA activation will be immediate.*   The length of the simulation is dependent on the Archive accessed.Memories provide the briefest duration, while historical archives can be looped to ensure the most satisfaction with your experience.To end an Archive, within the memory or simulation tap your wrist twice to remove the access chip.Upon removal, you will immediately regain consciousness within the safety of your Archive access location.The Archives: just another example of Indras greatness!The Archives: offering a wealth of knowledge, a virtual preservation of your personal history, and hours of fun!**  The Archives: a universe of delight at your fingertip!***  * Your Archive access is monitored by the High Council via thumbprint DNA matching.Your individual Archive access is restricted at their discretion.** If you attempt to access an Archive the Indra High Council has not made available to you, you will face immediate dismissal from the Archives.This process, also referred to as flinging, is both shameful and illegal.Repeat offenders will face punishment as dictated by the High Council.In extreme cases, the High Council Archive Commission may choose to give the offending citizen permanent shadow status.Shadowed citizens are rendered voiceless and sentenced to wander the Archives for the remainder of their lives.You will know them due to their blank stares and hooded cloaks.Do not interact with them.Shadowed citizens serve as living reminders of the great gifts bestowed on the citizens of Indra, the Archives being among them, and the severe penalty for taking advantage of them.*** Archive areas and experiences are restricted by and provided at the sole

High Council command.2           The Orphanage   Lex   There is a story that everyone in the Orphanage knows.It is not about family, hope, or love.Its about genetics.Mutations.The ones that lurk beneath the earth, that are cloaked in shadows and hidden within the eaves of the cavernous mantle.Though I have never seen one, they have made orphans of many.If you listen closely while nestled in your too small sleeper, you can hear their breathing beyond the security gates.Their bloodcurdling cries, their savage grunts.Each night, at lights out, we feel we are at their mercy.That is why twice a year the caretakers round up orphans, no one knows how they choose, in the middle of the night while everyone is asleep.They are forced to walk outside in their bare feet, their slippers left bedside to be reused by someone else.They are taken to a junction and there they wait.How long they wait depends on how hungry the mutations are.The mutations ...they can look like anything.The one I imagine has fused eyes and twin mouths that feed into the same throat.Its spine arcs so much it almost breaks through the skin of its back.Its pupils are the color of mothers milk, and its jaws are powerful enough to snap through bone.When youre brought to the junction, youre left in the pitch black.You cry, and every noise frightens you.You dont know yet how to be strong.When they come for you, if they dont eat you immediately, they will take you back to their tribe, far below, to be raised among them.They will put you to work, and your own body will betray you.It will become like theirs.Your legs will crack as they grow into new forms, and if you are pretty, you will lose that, too.Twice a year the mutations take orphans, gifted to continue our sanctuary here in the bowels of the earth.At the point where the City of Indra doesnt care what goes onwe are that far beneath.There are greater worries.After all, whos going to miss an orphan?All I had was my own hyper crib at the Orphanage, and sometimes even that I had to share.A tiny box on tall legs, stuffed with two hungry babies.It was but one of a dozen in my unit, and but one unit among a dozen others.The Independent High Council sent Recruiter to the Orphanage twice a year to inspect the new babies born without names.He wandered the rows of identical cribs, serving Indra in its moral obligation to its underprivileged.Recruiter came, he looked, and he left.He didnt expect to find anything worthwhile.In fact, he was pretty confident he wouldnt.If you made it past the crib stage, you were assigned to Infant Surveillance.That wasnt so bad.Youre so little, you dont know any different.If you made it a few more years, you got a cot in the Intermediate Dormitory.Now that was something else entirely.During processing, I got a way too big uniform.Room to grow, said Caretaker.If you got the chance, that is.At the time I didnt know that not all of us do.Caretaker leaned over and looked at me.She hated me, I could tell.All the caretakers did.Even as an infant, I didnt play by the rules.Made too much noise, used the playthings incorrectly.Led the group in building entire cities with the polyblox, then gleefully clomped the whole structure to pieces.The other kids didnt do things like that.They liked watching me do them, though.Giggled and clapped their hands.Destructive tendencies, muttered the caretakers, powerless to punish me, at least not when Recruiter was hanging around.His uniform wasnt like theirs.It was impeccably clean, his boots unsullied by grime, his collar unyellowed.I thought he was supposed to be special.He couldve been my champion.Recruiter walked the rows, inspecting the quiet babies, the ones whose parents never smiled at them, never sang or bounced them on their knee.All they got were the Caretakers, who didnt hug or kiss or hold your hand.So these babies never learned to emote, their faces completely made of stone.Orphan babies never cry.They rarely make noise at all.When Recruiter got to me, he stared down into my hyper crib.His face was enormous and implacable.Theres nothing here, he said, as he had probably said on every inspection at every crib.I reached out for him and I grabbed the rail instead.I fumbled forward as he walked away.I grabbed the rail with both hands, pulling myself up, my doughy legs barely able to support my plump weight.He didnt linger over each crib for too long.I watched him as he worked.There are orphanages all over.Im sure we looked like nothing more than underdeveloped meat.He finished my row and moved on to the next.Still I watched him, a string of sounds starting to fall out of my mouth.He looked up.He looked at me.He inspected more cribs.I pushed my body over the lip of the crib and let gravity do the rest.I pushed to a wobbly stand and edged around the crib, guiding myself by the rails.More sounds that this time he ignored.I slapped the rail with one hand of pudgy fingers.He looked up again, annoyed.I returned his gaze with equal force.He looked around, as if unsure that this was really happening.He cut back to my crib and stared at me standing there.Then he pushed me down.A slight touch and he sent me back on my bottom.Perhaps he expected me to cry.When I didnt, he walked away.I fell onto my side and rolled onto my belly.As he continued his rounds, I stood again.I slapped the rail until I got his attention.He tried to ignore me, shooting glances across the room, but couldnt.He removed his cap and ran a hand through his hair.He sighed.He came over, and just as he was about to push me again, I spoke.No, I said.And he didnt.Ive been telling people no ever since.My memorys good, but not good enough to penetrate the infant haze.Something to do with underdeveloped brains prevents us from remembering those years.But I did manage to snatch my holofile off Recruiters desk one visithes been cursed with a small bladder and doesnt have the influence to get it modded, so his trips to the receptacle were frequent during testing.Recruiter would have taken it with him, but how did he know I could read?I didnt even know myself.I was only three.He hadnt administered that test yet.The holofile seemed to be no more than a toy.A toy that burst with sculpted light as soon as I opened it, casting forth images of me turning in circles.My tiny body, my little kid legs.Is that what I looked like?Watching myself during an activity unit, where I was made to hit targets with zip balls.They monitored my heartbeat with sensors all over my body and asked me questions like, Do you enjoy pain?No.What do you dream about?I dont know.Why do you hate the polyblox?I love them, I said excitedly.Especially the part where I smash them!Recruiters assessment of me trailed beneath: Early rebellious tendencies.Accelerated, aggressive reflexes.Correctly channeled, SUBJECT could prove Useful to Society.Unheard of development considering her status as Offspring Waste.Reading this, Im surprised I hadnt been thrown out the gates to mutants.The Caretaker looked at her holofile, then back at me.You already have a name, she said, surprised.How very odd.Ive never seen one of you already having a name.Who gave it to you?I dont know, I said.Later, Id find out they didnt assign names until wed assimilated from Infant Surveillance to Intermediate Dorm.Never knew how wed react to the dorm transition.Some didnt make it through the first night, so why waste a good name on a defective orphan?Well, you always were ...different, she said, like I had an extra foot or something.Now you are Lexie.Say it after me.Lex ie.Lex, I said.That sounded better.No.Lex ie.Thats what it says right here.Lex, I said again.She sighed, knew it was pointless to argue.She practically shoved me down the corridor to be issued my thermasheets.Relieved to see me go, I could tell.Now Id be someone elses problem.Lex or Lexie, it didnt matter.No one learned names in the Intermediate Dorm.The closest you got to existing was your cot number.My real new name?242.The dorm was enormous.Cots as far as you could see.Lots of kids, all bigger than us new transfers.All wearing the same gray uniforms on their skinny bodies, their skin colorless from lack of exposure.No one noticed our arrival.Even with all those kids, the dorm was dead quiet.We were still little, didnt know orphan rule #1: Dont draw attention.Not that I followed rules.But still, I could tell this place wasnt like Infant Surveillance.Not at all.Orphan rule #2: Dont ask questions.I could never get that one either.It was the first week and 241 had been right next to me at evening cot confinement.Id heard her snoring.Come morning, every trace of her was gone, even her thermasheets.Whered she go?I yelled.No one answered me.Just looked away.New transfer, someone whispered.Whered she go?I said louder.Sharp stares.Pale faces pinched in worry.That just made me want to scream.I raised my voice.Whered she  Shhhhhhhh.Someone placed a hand on my shoulder.An older girl was leaning over, smiling at me.Id noticed her before because, unlike the rest of us, she had some color.Like she was glowing from the inside.The older girl looked down at me.I shut up.Her smile was what did it.You didnt see those very often.I like you, she said softly.You say what you think.But right now, you should know when that becomes dangerous.But where did  My stomach growled.Youre hungry?she asked.I nodded.Little kids, I quickly learned, got pummeled in the rush to the ration line.As hard as Id pushed through the crowd, the food was gone when I got there.With so few caretakers, no one seemed to notice.Or maybe they just didnt care.Sometimes little kids starved to death.It happened once in my first year there, a little boy who didnt wake up in the morning, and caretakers just carted away the husk of his weightless body.So that morning the older girl took my hand and led me right to the front of the line, other kids stepping aside for her.I was starving and by then completely forgot about my neighbors empty cot.Kids are dumb like that.Easily distracted.Maybe she did it on purpose.Maybe she didnt want to tell me about 241 just yet.The older girl was eleven, a year shy of graduating.When you made it to eleven, other orphans respected you because you were a survivor.You might actually make it out.You could teach them how to do the same.The older girls name, she told me later, was Samantha.But dont tell anyone I told you, Lex, she whispered.Thatll be our secret.You call me 374 and Ill call you 242 and only we will know the truth.Samantha, Id thought, grinning.I loved having a secret, and I kept it.I never said her real name aloud, not once.374 watched out for me.I never knew why she chose me, but she did.In exchange, she got little 242 shadowing her every move.She didnt seem to mind taking care of me.Those first weeks were scary, and shed sneak to my cot and hold my hand and keep me from slipping away in the dark.No polyblox empires here, no other kids clapping at my antics.Without 374, Id have disappeared.Maybe even to the mutants.She made sure I got fed.Made sure I washed my face at grooming.Even showed me how to sleep with my sanibrush and day uniform lodged under my body so no one would steal them in the night.No one ever bothered me with 374 around.Just do everything like you mean it, she told me.And no one will ask questions.She should have picked another kid.I was always doing everything wrong.Just stay quiet, thats all that was required of me.I couldnt keep my mouth shut.Shes gonna bottom out, the others whispered, staring at me.I got written up again and again.One night 374 was braiding my hair before evening confinement.Youre the only one who can make my hair listen, I told her.She smiled at that.Unlike me, she kept silent until recreation.Whats bottom out?I asked.Her hands stopped moving in my hair.She sighed before braiding again.Bottoming out is when you go away and never come back, she said quietly.Like turning twelve?Not exactly.Like 241?Yes, she said.Like 241.When you bottom out, that means the Orphanage decides to kick you out.Where do they take you?Im not sure, she said.She was working my hair more quickly now and pulling harder.But why ...ow!Sorry, she said, easing up.She turned me around so I was facing her and leaned in close.I wont lie to you, 242.I already know you can keep a secret.I nodded.Lex and Samantha, I thought.No one knows exactly where they take you, but probably the Lower Levels.The lowest, to be exact.Rock Bottom.Like the stories.Of the mutations.Dont listen to the stories.Rock Bottoms where they find most of us, you know.Bring us here to see if were worth anything.And if we arent, they just send us back.This was a big secret, I could tell.Bigger even than our real names.Rock Bottom isnt a nice place, either.I can still remember it.Orphans sent back there wont last long.They dont have the skills or strength.That isnt right!I squealed, horrified.That doesnt make any  She put her hand over my mouth.Of course it isnt, she said calmly.But you cant change it by complaining.Then how?She smiled at me.Someday well talk about that, but not today.Im afraid your hair needs to listen more.Gently, she turned me back around to finish my hair.I had a million questions, but I knew not to ask.There was a long silence.The repetitive motion of her hands calmed me.At least for a few minutes.In the end, I couldnt help myself.Why do they take some of us and not others?I said, trying to keep my voice as calm and quiet as hers.Lots of reasons.What about 241?The freckles, maybe.Those spots on her face.They didnt like them.I didnt understand, but I nodded anyway.I liked the spots.No one else had them.Id thought 241 had gotten lucky to be so different.Genetic flaw was a term I wouldnt know the meaning of until I was much older.You have the most amazing eyes, Samantha said then.Like none Ive ever seen.I had never noticed.Though I would spend time later on searching out just what had made her say that.But what if they take me?I asked.They wont, she said firmly.I promise.How do you know?Because, 242, youre special.I smiled to myself.And theyll never take you either, I said.Cause youre special too.I really believed that.There was no one else like 374.She could cut the ration line and braid hair and everyone respected her.She and I would be fine.She didnt say anything, just finished braiding.But being special doesnt mean you arent a dumb kid sometimes.Sometimes 374 would disappear for hours.When I asked where shed been, she just smiled.You know I can keep a secret, I told her.But if I gave them all to you, youd burst.Nuh uh.Someday Ill tell you.I promise.It was a promise she wouldnt keep.My eyes popped open right before the official arise sensor.At wake up, I liked to run over and stare at her until her eyes flickered open.Oh, hi, 242, shed say sleepily.Shed yawn and tell me my hair looked crazy.But on one morning, her cot was empty.In her place, a cleansing machine hummed, blowing the cot with a steady stream of antisepticizer.No matter how many times she reminded me that when she turned twelve shed be gone, I was still shocked.I could barely move from her bedside.An orphan with stringy blond hair tapped me on the shoulder.I know where she went, she said, even though shed never spoken to me before.None of them had.She graduated, I said.No, she didnt.She was twelve, I said, fighting back a sob.She graduated.No, she was still eleven, she spit back.She was bottomed out.Thats a lie!No, its not.We came in the same day.She wouldnt leave before me.Everyone knows it.I looked around.Kids were pretending not to listen to us.Well?I said to them.No one answered, of course.Is that true?I said louder.Pale faces pinched even tighter.One girl looked up and gave me a tiny nod before just as quickly looking away.Liar.Believe what you want, said the one with stringy hair.But I heard Caretaker say it.Probably happened cause of you.Cause she spent time with you.And youre bad.Probably happened cause you get written up so much, and they figured she was the same.Then she smugly smiles at me.I knew another write up wouldnt matter, so I finished our conversation with my fists.She lost a tooth, and I won another write up.But I was right: it didnt matter.I was still alone.My own turning twelve was so far away, and 374Samanthacreated an absence I couldnt replace.That night I cried, feeling more alone in my cot than I had ever been, fighting to stay silent so no one could hear my shame.I was still here, stuck, and I cried for the first and last time, overwhelmed by years of abuse for no reason other than being born into misfortune, and blessed with the knowledge that it was on me to make my life better.To become what I wanted to be.I made a promise to myself, one that I would die before breaking: I wont need anyone else.Not ever.Not ever, ever, ever.3           Countdown to Emergence Ball: 10 Years   Livia   She must be initiated into society, Waslo said, as though I couldnt hear him.As though I wasnt right across from him, lifting spoonfuls of pudding from the bowl in front of me, catching every word.He had yet to realize the extent of my capabilities, I suppose.To Waslo, I appeared to be a normal child.However, I understood more than he could possibly know, and my memory was sharp enough to recall the smallest incidents.I had yet to understand this could be used in my favor.Though as much as I disliked Waslo, without him, there would be no Marius.She is perhaps the loveliest woman I have ever seen.Most others agree she is fetching, though are quick to add a hushed despite the obvious misfortune.Marius is a mere five foot two, a burden for which most Indrithian women would be utterly devastated.Had they not reached five foot eight by age thirteen, they would have already partaken of every alteration available.They would have sought out Rejuvenation Island for stretching treatments, subsisted on genetic cocktails, and willingly traded a finger for a few added inches.Though I am tall, Marius has taught me that height is not everything.Even Governess, who by comparison is gargantuan, once told me Marius is rather brave.Marius needs not her pitying admiration, or anyone elses, to accept her genetics.Perhaps she sees things differently from such a low perspective.Marius is beloved by all, myself included.I often wish Marius lived with me and not on another island.When I was little, I once asked her if she might relocate to Helix.Please!I whined.We have plenty of room!To this, she simply laughed.Well, in that case, I would have to bring Waslo with me.I didnt ask again.Unlike with Veda or Governess or even Marius, though, I was incapable of reading Waslos feelings.I found this especially frustrating: my ability to read others filled me with confidence.Though I didnt speak much, I could feel what the people around me were going through.The boredom of a maid as she scrubbed down a corridor, the excitement of a gardener as he programmed new flowers in the orchard.In this way, I was never truly alone.Yet despite my best efforts, Waslo emoted less than a synth tree.For this reason, I scrutinized his every last gesture.Soon she must enter the rest of Indra, he continued.But it is rather early for all this, dear, responded Marius.She is very young.She moved toward me and gently pushed the hair off my forehead.I smiled up at her.I loved Marius.She was little, just as I was, and always kind to me.Perhaps not young enough, said Waslo.She is seven now.People wonder.Let them wonder, said Marius, though I felt her hesitation.That is not an adequate solution, my dear.At some point, she must know Indra as we do.I must speak to Governess first, of course.Affirm the necessity of proper discipline.The child has been given too much freedom here, which will make the transition even more trying.I find it worrying how she will appear to others.I, on the other hand, worry about her, said Marius.I took another mouthful of pudding.Waslo put a hand to her chin and gently turned her face toward his own.I know you worry, dear, he said softly, as do I.  But we have obligations, do we not?Marius nodded.Waslos face changed suddenly, the hardness fading away.He smiled at her, eyes glistening in a way I found especially unnerving.My charming little thing, he said.Then he put his lips to hers.Id thought such tenderness was not in Waslos character.And to others, it wasnt.Soon after, his voice became gruffer when addressing Governess.Must she dress like this?he asked, noticing my stained smock and muddy bloomers.Governess acquiesced and forced me into a frilly frock that pinched in strange places.Have you not groomed her hair?Waslo would say, and soon after Governess would be drawing screams from my throat with each pull through my tangles.I began to understand: when Waslo came calling, misfortune soon followed.I would hide when the maid announced his arrival.In the end, Marius would find me, for which I would be grateful.As much as I disliked Waslo, missing Mariuss visits would have been devastating.Waslo and Marius might live on another island, but they visited Helix often.It seemed unfair, I thought, that they must be taken as a pair.To cohabitate, I decided, meant spending all your time with someone awful.There you are!Marius would squeal, kneeling low enough to see me underneath the desk in Fathers study or buried under the fringed pillows at the base of Mothers air harp.Found you, my little firefly!She would open her arms and I would crawl into the warmth of her embrace.She was well aware, I suppose, of my locations: the places I felt safest were the ones that had belonged to them.Mother and Father.Governess used the words often, yet never explained their significance.Terms as familiar to me as my left and right foot, yet as foreign as the world beyond Helix.They were mysterious strangers, like characters in a make believe.They had lived here on Helix Island, and now they didnt.They were connected to me, yet somehow not.And yet, their rooms remained untouched shrines.As though they would return at any moment, Father to revisit his most recent deductions, Mother to compose a new aria.Marius would never be angry when she discovered me, only wrinkle her nose at my misbehavior.Even her chiding was playful.You mustnt run off like that, or perhaps one day we will not be able to find you.You will always find me!I would squeal.My love, what will we do with you?In the end, Waslo would be the one to answer that question.And his solution would be far worse than new frocks and tangles.I was going somewhere special.That is what Governess had told me that morning.I was excited.Not excited enough to overlook being pinched in all the wrong places, though.But why must I?I asked.Because all the other girls will have dresses as pretty as these.But why should I look like everyone else?Governess didnt answer, just kept buttoning.There were so many buttons running up my back, each tiny and difficult to fasten.Id come to believe she might never finish and I would stand in this same spot until I grew up, the unfastened buttons popping off on their own accord as my body grew bigger.There, she said, finally finishing the last.Together we looked in the mirror.I hated what I saw.A pale pink frock to my knees, layers of fabric lifting the skirt until it rose in a stiff circle around me.Ribbons winding around the entire horrible costume, their ends tied into elaborate bows, as though to keep me escaping my own body.Lovely, said Governess.Yuck.Still, I couldnt conceal my smile.I was going on a journey.This is what Marius had patiently explained.I would meet other girls my age and learn all sorts of fascinating things and no, I could not bring Veda, but she would be right there waiting upon my evening return.Governess kneeled in front of me, overseeing the final adjustments.Tightening every inch of me.I sensed her sudden worry and reached out to touch her cheek.Why are you sad, Governess?I am not sad.Yes, you are.Gently, she removed my hand from her face.Livia, it is not proper to touch Governess in this manner.What manner?As though ...she is your friend.I wrinkled my nose.I had always touched Governess.She was my friend.A friend who sometimes forced orders upon me that I found rather displeasingdemanding I finish a dish I disliked or go to my sleeper when I hadnt yet finished playingbut still a friend.For a moment, I thought Governess might cry, something I had never seen her do.Instead, she squeezed my hand, fluffed my ruffles, and stood abruptly.Time to go, little one, she said.Waslo looked me up and down, as he often did, though his reaction was somewhat surprising: he appeared pleased.Very good, Governess, he said.I am glad we had our discussion.This was long before my own Discussions started, yet I already disliked the word.The threeMarius, Waslo, and Governessstared down at me in heavy silence, their expressions making me squirm  The shuttle is ready, said Marius, breaking the quiet.She leaned down, giving me a comforting smile.Are you ready, my love?For the first time, I wasnt quite sure.The shuttle pod ride was a journey, just as Marius had promised, though one I could have done without.I had never left the island, let alone seen the point where its farthest reaches met the sky.You must stay within the designated edges of Helix, Governess often warned.She had shown me the posts stationed near the welcome gate and prohibited me from ever crossing them.She explained I would most likely be injured if I tried to go beyond.There are traps to protect us from intruders near the edge, Livia.Invisible stinger barriers to deter trespassers.Hidden holes covered in synth grass, large enough to swallow a tiny girl whole.You would end up at the bottom, alone in the dark, and we might never find you.Im not afraid, I would say defiantly, though I did as I was told back then.I had never liked the dark.When I couldnt see my own hand in front of me, I felt strange, as though I might not even exist.Now, here I was, detached from the ground where I had spent my entire life.Seeing the sky above Helix was one thing.Flying through it, something else.I had never been so frightened in my life.Our air transporter hurtled through the sky, dodging other shuttles and speeding around the edges of islands, my stomach jumping with each turn.I pushed my face against the window, but the view went by too quickly: clouds, blue sky, islands, transporters.The sky was more active when you were in it, not standing on solid ground.Will we smash into something and explode?I wondered.Will pieces of us shower the skies?I pushed my lips together to keep from squealing, wrapping my hand around Mariuss wrist and holding tight.Do not worry, love, she told me.I will not let any harm come to you.My legs were wobbly as I exited the shuttle.Standing on island ground, I wanted to lean over and hug the surface beneath my feet, until I recalled Waslos final words before boarding the shuttle: Do not draw attention to yourself, Livia.You must appear to be normal as everyone else.Just do as you are told and remain alert.I tried to forget the fear I had felt moments earlier.Now I followed Waslos advice, my eyes hungrily taking in this new island.We are within a group of islands, said Marius, gently leading me forward.The Education and Socialization Cluster, as they are referred to.This is the tiniest one, suitable for the youngest of trainees.You will start here and eventually progress to each one until your Emergence Ball.I could see the islands edge from our location, not more than a quick sprint distant, and wondered if there were hidden holes ready to swallow little girls here as well.This might be an island, but in no way did it resemble my home.The synth grass was short and sparse, and the gardens featured traditional white lilies.On Helix, we had strange crossbreeds of roots and flowers.I could feel the garden crews confusion with our decisions on every visit.Why did we program such strange new growths?Why did we allow the foliage to grow so thick?I once asked Governess this very question, to which her response was simple: That is what your mother wanted.I loved our gardens, my curiosity charged with every garden crew visitation, knowing soon the shocking pink blooms might be replaced by tiny purple buds, or our shiny nuts transformed to exotic, inedible fruits.How could the rest of Indra deny themselves the discovery that overnight, yellow blooms might burst forth from unexpected crevices, or disappear just as quickly?When Governess made a rare attempt to program something less exotic, the results were never pretty.Hence the bitter tasting apples.The Helix gardens were my ever changing playground, and at that moment, I would have given anything to be back there instead of on this tiny, unremarkable island where the growing things mirrored my unhappiness.Marius led us down a path lined with shrubs aggressively trimmed into stubby cubes and pyramids; I looked at their sharp angles and felt sorry for all who laid eyes on them.We came to halt in a clearing where a shiny steel building rose to the sky.The light reflected strongly off its facade, obscuring the glowing hololetter sign: Socialization Club.I had never seen other little girls, as strange as that seems now, and it was like encountering another species.Everything about them made me uncomfortable, from their high, tinkling laughter to their small hands.Not a bow untied or pleat untucked or strand of hair out of place.We all wore the same dress, with the same ribbons woven through our hair.Yet somehow, I knew we were nothing alike.Silent, tall governesses watched from the edges with stony faces and stiff blue uniforms.These ones wore bulky utility holsters strapped over their broad shoulders, the ones I knew to be packed with emergency components and child rearing devices, including a stunner that administered a quick, painful shock.Years earlier Governess had a holster of her own.Id shocked myself playing with the stunner, but the tears were meaningless when compared to the sparks!The electric blue arc between the prongs!Governess woke to find me streaking the various multicolored antisepticizers across the wall and, in a final touch, burning a constellation of holes across the entire spread with the healing laser.Livia!she bellowed, and I stepped back, grinning, to allow her a better perspective.I remember the surge of pride.Look at this masterpiece!The holster disappeared soon after, and I hadnt seen it again until a few days ago.Id known something was different when Governess came to collect me for lunch, her footsteps slower and heavier in the hallway.When she appeared, I was greeted by the holster and her unhappy expression, her shoulder stooping under the weight.Waslo deemed it necessary, she said before I could speak.Then she gave me a knowing look.And I am sure he will notice if items are missing or misused.I hadnt wanted to take anything except her pain.I could feel it coming off her in waves.And somehow, I knew the holster was only part of it.In that moment, I had the distinct feeling everything was about to change.Now, standing on this tiny, unfamiliar island, I took no pleasure in being correct.Especially without Governess by my side.Marius will serve as escort, Waslo said shortly before departure.As usual, he seemed unaware of my presence, though I was right in front of him tapping on the marble floor.I was inventing a song in my head, my feet keeping the rhythm, though I was careful not to miss a word.Curiosity will be high, of course, but Marius and I do have a certain standing within Indra.Let the reports begin to circulate of our approval and the childs genetic well being and pleasing manner.Is that agreeable?He didnt wait for an answer.Good.But what is causing that racket?I stopped tapping.Not for Waslo, but for Governess: the look on her face worried me.Lately, smiles were less frequent and silence was becoming ordinary.I tried to barrage her with unnecessary questions and pointed out fresh stains as though surprised by them, but nothing got a reaction.I even hid her micro specs, the ones she used for her holoreader and to inspect for errant particles when the maids finished cleaning.She didnt even chastise me, just sighed heavily and said, The time has come to cease with childish pranks.One girl in particular caught my eye.A group was gathered tightly around her with adoring faces.When she giggled, they giggled as well.When she spoke, they leaned in close to listen.Do not worry, said Marius softly.Your beauty is far superior to every last one of them.For that alone, they will want to be your friend.I didnt find this comforting.Even less comforting, the sudden, overwhelming wave of curiosity.The others had taken notice, and I could feel their eyes boring into me.Do not look away from me, said Marius, catching my gaze.Her expression was unreadable.And in this face I knew so well, I couldnt help but see her as a stranger.You are doing just fine, she continued.Now I will stop talking, and I want you to say something.Then we will laugh.Not too loud, mind you, but just a little.I go quiet, you speak in a conversational manner, we laugh.Do you understand?I nodded.Suddenly, I did understand: Marius was playing a part.Waslo had said she would escort me, so she must be playing at Escort.Marius even had a costume, trading her usual shimmering robes for simple beige ones.When I first saw her, Id worried she might choke on the tall collar, or that her hair, piled dangerously high upon her head, might go toppling.Now I am done talking, Marius said.Your turn.I do not know what to say, I responded.To that, she laughed, and I knew it was my time to do the same.We both laughed at nothing and it occurred to me this journey would be full of complications and nonsense.
