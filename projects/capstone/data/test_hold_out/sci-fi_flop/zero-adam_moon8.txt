I released the Cogmores theyre holding prisoner, and I wanted to get away before they made a break for it so I dont get fingered for the crime.Volts paused for a very long time.Then he said, Youre a damn idiot.Eve shook her head.You are, Zero.Youre an idiot.He didnt expect anything less from them, but it did hurt being called an idiot by his two closest friends.Eve said, Im plugging in for the duration of the journey.Volts added, Me too.Desperately, Zero said, I dont need to charge, though.Youre going to leave me by myself?Eve grabbed him by the shoulders and said severely, You might need the time to get your head straight.Were about to board a Beetar warship as hired muscle and youve gone and convinced yourself that theyre the bad guys.Volts said, They probably are the bad guys, but who cares?We just need to keep our noses clean.Setting enemy prisoners free is hardly that.He plugged in before Zero could retort.Eve said, Theyre saving our lives.We literally owe them our existence.Let that sink into your thick skull before we rendezvous with them.Zero nodded.She was right.He had made a soap opera out of something pretty cut and dry.When someone saves your life, you should do anything to repay them.She went to the opposite wall and plugged in.Her head drooped and her eyes slid shut.This was going to be a long and boring trek with only his own twisted thoughts to keep him company.Part 4:  Warship    A faint warning siren sounded that startled him out of his daydreams.He checked the monitors to see the biggest, meanest warship he couldve ever imagined.With a shudder, they docked with it and he unplugged Volts and Eve.The doorway opened and Stacey and Piss pants were there waiting for them.Stacey rushed inside and wrapped Zero up in a hug.It was the best thing that had happened to him in a long time.She said, We got word that the orbital station over Cogmore went silent.After some investigation, it appears some Cogmore prisoners overtook it, killed everyone off, and then destroyed the ship.We know the Cogmores got off before it blew, but we couldnt be sure you guys had until now.Volts gave him a look that could kill, and Eve bumped his shoulder as she walked past.She said to him, Good plan, genius.You killed Parsons.Stacey stepped back and asked, Whats that supposed to mean?Eve softened.It doesnt mean a thing.Piss pants asked, Which one of you dambasses turned off the communication console?Weve been trying to get through to you all damn day.Zero shrugged.He hadnt messed with any of the controls, but that didnt stop Volts from glaring at him like he had.He had Stacey back in his life, but it seemed hed lost two friends in the process.Stacey led them from the ship and said, Make sure to bow when a Beetar comes near.Theyre sticklers for that crap.And dont strike up a conversation with any of them either.They hate that.Steer clear of the captain.His name is Flimfor and hes an asshole.Otherwise, theyre easy enough to get along with.The corridors were coated in a shiny black substance that reflected the lights above in disorienting ways.It took a few seconds to get used to it.The black that covered the walls seemed to move like it was an organic material, or somehow intelligent, but Zero chalked that up to his overactive imagination coupled with its disorienting effects.He ran a finger across a wall, and when he inspected it, it was unmarked and his finger was clean.Every few feet, they passed a closed steel door.They walked past a huge window to the outside that ran the entire length of the section of corridor they were in.It must have been thirty feet long.As they ogled it in sheer awe, Stacey said, Its not really glass.Its some type of material that projects what it sees from the opposite side.Its technically just an image.That took the splendor out of it.But then a little blue alien craft zipped past outside and fired on their ship.They didnt feel any of the direct hits, so Zero could only assume the Beetar ship had some sort of force field or super thick hull capable of absorbing impacts.Return fire came from above, but none of it hit the jittery little ship.It took evasive maneuvers which took it out of their view.Eve gasped, Thats one of those bastards that killed Creaker, Twitch, and Stomper.That type of ship took out the training center on Epigog.Stacey put a hand on her hip.Piss pants told me that too.Whatever took out the training center was advanced and gutsy, and these little ships are definitely that.Thirteen of them followed us all the way out here, taking little potshots at us whenever they get the chance.There are just seven of those thirteen left, but their lack of success hasnt slowed them down or given them pause for concern.Volts was mesmerized by the window, watching intently for the ship to return.Have any of them gotten through your defenses?The damage they do is minimal, but its cumulative.Thats why youre here.Were going to take the fight to them.Zero stammered, But were not warriors, were all washouts.The Beetars dont know that.They think were the cream of our batch, that we were unlucky enough to have our training cut short.They need to keep believing that.He wondered what type of weird looking aliens piloted those little blue ships.Which planet do they come from?We havent found their home world yet.The Beetars have their feelers out, but so far no one has any answers.All we know is the quadrant of space where their ships seem to congregate.Thats where well be heading.Eve asked, How long until we get to them?Well be there in a couple of days.Dont worry about them just yet.We have a lot of catching up to do.Follow me and Ill show you our living quarters.Piss pants had remained mainly in the background as Stacey led them.It was clear she had taken the lead since boarding the Beetar ship.They walked past a few Beetars as they stomped down the halls, careful to bow their heads as they passed.These Beetars looked far more regal than the ones they were used to.They looked bigger, too, like they could take a punch and give one back.That thought sent a shiver through Zeros spine.Until then hed always assumed Beetars dealt out their justice from a safe distance, using humans as their muscle, but these guys looked like they were bred for war.Stacey led them into a huge brightly lit room with white walls that clashed with the black oily walls theyd walked past.There were two communal tables set in the middle of the room, with board games laid out on each.Twenty charging ports lined the walls.Eve winked at him and whispered, We wont be using those things anymore.Stacey overheard and cocked her brow.Eve explained.Zero was abducted by enemy aliens, but instead of killing him, they enhanced him with a never ending battery.If we find ourselves in a pickle, we can all just charge from him now.Stacey looked him up and down like it was the first time theyd met.A lot has happened to you three since we last saw each other.Im eager to hear your stories.But I have to meet with my liaison officer first.Then well catch up.Piss pants stood beside her and said to them, Dont go anywhere.Well be right back.We just have to check in.Volts didnt waste any time.He rushed over to the nearest wall and plugged in.Eve shrugged.Zero looked at her for an explanation.Hes been that way lately.He freaks out if he goes too long without a boost.Best to ignore it until it passes.Zero sat in one of the mammoth chairs at the table and Eve sat opposite him.In a serious tone she said, When you released those Cogmore prisoners, you could have gotten all of us killed.What the hell were you thinking?Why did you do it?He rested his chin on the table.I helped them because I think were the bad guys.Eve slapped him on the top of the head like he was her kid brother and hed just said something idiotic.Were robots designed to kill.What in the world made you think wed be planting flowers and petting bunnies?You have to get with the program or youll take us all down with you.I know.It wont happen again.Good.I missed you, Zero.Its good to have you back, even if you were returned a little broken.He smiled up at her and she reached across the table and patted him on the shoulder.When Piss pants and Stacey returned, they were solemn.Piss pants unplugged Volts and told him to take a seat.This new attitude of theirs had them spooked.Stacey said, Apparently when the Cogmore prisoners escaped and destroyed the ship you guys just left, it sent shockwaves across the empire.There are new uprisings on Beetar controlled planets erupting by the minute as word spreads that the Beetars can be taken out.My liaison just instructed me to ship out two of you to help quell these uprisings and to protect high ranking Beetar citizens.Captain Flimfor apparently blames you three for failing to suppress the Cogmores.Thats why hes chosen to send two of you back out, as a sort of punishment.Eve and Volts bored holes through Zero with their eyes.Stacey added, Just be content that he didnt decide to kill all three of you instead.Hes not one to be trifled with, so there will be no discussion about his decision.It must be done.He hadnt met Captain Flimfor, but he already disliked him.Volts asked in a quavering voice, Who gets to stay?Zero didnt understand why there was fear in his tone.Maybe it was because he understood more than he did.It wouldnt be the first time.Stacey said, Its my choice who gets to stay and who has to go.This was a hard decision, but Volts and Eve will be sent out to help establish order.In the meantime.well stay out of harms way until you return.Then we can go back and take on the mysterious blue ships that have plagued us.Volts stood up suddenly and looked back at the ports on the walls.He was shivering with unbridled fear.Zero finally realized why he was so afraid of leaving; his phobia of powering off was growing by the second.Eve said, Volts needs a rest.Hes overexerted himself in the past few days.Zero can leave with me.Zero wanted to refuse, but he was the person responsible for this mess.Hed be a worthless coward if he let his frightened friend go off to fight his battles while he stayed behind in relative safety.Desperate, he said, Arent there other mechs out there that can handle this?What about Mike, Jackson, Kathy and Winthrop?I dont know who those people are.They were stationed with us on Cogmore.They were reassigned to a corporate planet.Then they already have assignments that have nothing to do with this.And like I said, you were hand picked by the captain as a punishment.I know its not fair or even justified, but theres nothing I can do about it.She was wrong though.It was justified.In fact, they were getting off light.If Captain Flimfor found out what hed done, hed do far worse than this.He looked Stacey over to see if this was some kind of elaborate joke, but she was deadly serious.She said to him, Its a big empire out there, and its being tested because of what happened in orbit around Cogmore.You have no choice in the matter.Two of you need to go, although Id prefer for you to stay behind and let the other two go instead.If you have an enemy built power source inside of you, Id hate for you to be questioned out in the field and fingered as an enemy collaborator or something.He appreciated that she was pulling excuses out of her ass to keep him close, but Eve and Volts knew what hed done.Hed never be able to look them in the eye again if he bowed out and let them go in his stead.I need to go.Volts needs to stay behind.Stacey looked disgusted.I just got you back, Jack.I dont want to lose you again.His heart skipped a beat.She did care.It wasnt just him who felt that way.But he couldnt let it influence him.He had to be one of the two who got sent off ship.My name is Zero and I have to go.Im sorry.Volts put a hand on his shoulder.Im sorry, pal.I appreciate this.I promise Ill get over this psychosis by the time you return.It was a shame to see Volts deteriorated like that, but Cogmore had changed them all.It had made Eve stronger, Volts jittery, and it had literally changed Zero physically and mentally.He just didnt know if he had changed like Eve, for the better, or like Volts, for the worst.Piss pants looked overjoyed that his best buddy was going to get to stay, but he was holding back his enthusiasm so he wouldnt upset the rest of them.Stacey said to Eve, Youll be going to the penal planet called Ishca.Its hell on Ishca, but youll be in good company.Some of the best soldiers are stationed there already.She looked at Zero and sighed.Youll be personal security for a Beetar diplomat who is working with a new alien race the Beetars are trying to bring into the fold.Advancement is not always greeted with open arms, so this Beetar has become the target of attacks, especially now that news has spread about Cogmore.He desperately wanted to switch with Eve.Shed drawn the short straw.Or more realistically, Stacey had given it to her to keep him safe.He opened his mouth to voice his objection when Eve cut him off with, Thats perfect.Ive been itching for more action.From what Ive heard the horrors on the penal planet are grossly over exaggerated anyway.Stacey said evenly, They are not, but I appreciate your enthusiasm.Come with me.You ship out right away.Its not far from here, so youll arrive shortly.To Zero she said, Ill be back for you.When Stacey left with Piss pants and Eve, Volts whispered, You shouldnt have saved those Cogmores.Theyre bad news, dude.He was about to correct him when Volts walked away and plugged into the nearest port, shutting down completely.Apparently the implications of his new battery and the cable that might allow him to recharge anyone at a moments notice had yet to sink into Volts fevered mind.That was okay, though.Hed protect this diplomatic Beetar dork until the heat was off and then hed be back aboard the warship in no time.Perhaps he was deluding himself.The galaxy was far more dangerous than he would have ever imagined, and lately his actions were a big reason why it was so dangerous.If he died, he probably deserved it.He went to the big bay window hoping to see Eves ship take off.He watched as faint mist issued from somewhere outside and below.Then a black and yellow ship shot away from the Beetar warship.One of the little blue alien ships gave chase, but guns from the Beetar warship scared it off, giving Eves ship a clean getaway.As soon as he saw the blue ship circle back, his limbs loosened.Then he realized he was about to go through the exact same thing when he took off, and his joints tensed up again.Stacey approached him and said angrily: You cant wander the halls by yourself, Jack.You need to stop calling me Jack.I forgot.Sorry, Zero.I just wanted to make sure Eve got away safely.You three have formed a bond together, then?He understood what she was getting at.Weve been through a lot together, but you have to remember that I was a prisoner for most of my time on Cogmore.Eve and Volts have history together, Im still a bit of an outcast.She smiled.You are different, thats for sure.When do I ship out?Soon.Piss pants is prepping your ship.Hell come and get us when its ready.If it was so important to bring us here, why dont any of the Beetars on this ship object to our reassignment elsewhere?The Beetars on this ship are the ones who reassigned you, remember?Those blue ships out there pose no real danger to us.But they became such an annoyance that it was decided to bring in reinforcements to take them out for good.So I guess taking out the blues is no longer as important as my new assignment.Nope.Theyll live with the annoyance for a little while longer to make sure other corners of the empire are secure.Im not supposed to know this, but I think this ship is like their hub of operations or something.Its built to withstand just about anything.Ill be safe while youre gone.My head is spinning.I wish I could just get an assignment and stick to it.Youll do fine.The more experiences you have, the better prepared youll be for whats coming.There was an ominous quality to her voice that disturbed him.What are you talking about?Shit.Nothing.Worry about the Beetar diplomat for now.If you lose focus, youll just make yourself an easier target.Dont change the subject.Tell me what you meant.I cant.I promised.Just come back here in one piece, okay?She moved forward and embraced him.She pulled her head away, and for a horrifying moment he worried she would try to kiss him with her big metal mouth.But she looked into his eyes and said, You need to survive.Make sure you do.Thats the plan.When I get back here I expect you to tell me what you know.Ill try.Its way more complicated than you think, and youre not going to like what you hear.He already didnt like what he was hearing.Wasnt his reality complicated enough?Hadnt he been through the meat grinder already?How much more bullshit could he take?He asked a question that sounded silly as it left his mouth.Are we the bad guys?She pulled away and smiled.Im glad youre concerned about that.No, we are not.Were the good guys.But thats all I can say just now.Thankfully Piss pants came rushing towards them at that moment or Stacey might have felt the need to tell him more than his fragile psyche could handle.The ships ready to go.To Zero he said, Youll be there in about a week.Id catch up on my beauty sleep if I were you.He sighed.I cant power down or recharge anymore because of the stupid Cogmore battery inside of me.Stacey shushed him and looked up and down the corridor to make sure no Beetars had overheard him mention the Cogmore modification.She whispered, If you cant go offline, then just relax and enjoy the solitude.You deserve a little downtime.She was wrong though.Solitude was the last thing he needed.Hed spent two days alone on the shuttle to the Beetar ship while Eve and Volts went offline, and before that hed spent days as a prisoner, and then as a willing collaborator to an inhuman enemy.He needed a human connection in the worst way.He took solace in the knowledge that he had no choice in the matter.He just had to do what was required of him and keep his complaints to a minimum.As long as he looked at it that way, it was easier to accept his role.Piss pants said, Our launch windows closing.Hurry the hell up.He followed after him, bowing rapidly each time he passed a Beetar.Some of them were decent enough, and a couple even bowed back, which was weird.He had to wonder though: were they their saviors, benefactors, or their masters?He wondered how they saw their own role in their lives.He was pretty sure it wasnt the same way they saw themselves.The shuttle was small and the inside was cramped.Piss pants slapped him on the ass, his hand making a loud clang.Good luck, man.See you when you get back.Stacey hugged him quickly and then shoved him inside the shuttle.It leaves in less than a minute.Hurry up and strap in or youll bounce around on takeoff like a pinball.He didnt need to be told twice.He found the harnesses and secured himself as they closed the ship up.Stacey yelled over the intercom, The planet is called Dosia and its inhabitants are called Dosians.From what Ive been told theyre mostly peaceful.I dont know much else beyond that.The Beetar youll be protecting is named Frad.He laughed, and she must have heard him because she giggled back.Frad is supposed to be smart and capable.My liaison didnt have any intel beyond that.Good luck.He was about to say thank you, but he was suddenly pushed against the wall as his shuttle blasted away from the Beetar ship.The shuttle was fired upon.He saw the little blue ship strafe him, but his ship didnt sustain any damage.He saw several lines of fire erupt from the Beetar ship and the blue ship zipped around and away from him.After that scare, the trip became uneventful and remained that way.It became immediately apparent his ship either didnt have an artificial gravity generator, or it did but it hadnt been turned on.Because he didnt like floating around without control, he stayed strapped in for most of the trip.The journey was dull.He spent most of it in a maelstrom of self pity and doubt.It occurred to him that he was quite possibly the worst creature the universe had ever shat out.He had failed as a human being.Had his cancer not led him here, he would have toiled away in the quarries until the day he drank himself to death.Even as a mechanical monster, he had failed.He was the only recruit to not make it past the firearms deployment part of training.Then, under his watch, the training camp had been obliterated.On Cogmore, hed annihilated both sides, Cogmore and Beetar, with his mere presence.And as if that wasnt enough, hed released those Cogmore prisoners, which was having a ripple effect that could possibly topple an empire.He was his own worst enemy, and if anyone knew what he had done during his short stint away from Earth, hed probably be executed for gross incompetence.Towards the end of the trip, the ship came very close to a huge star.He knew stars were big, but to see one up close was something else.It filled his entire monitor, even when he zoomed out.Luckily he didnt fall into it, which was a serious concern for a few minutes.The planet came into view ten minutes later.He didnt know what kind of propulsion system his shuttle was using, but it was way beyond anything humans had ever invented.Dosia was light blue with green swirls here and there and a few dark patches where land muddied the cloud color from below.He wondered how long hed be in orbit before another ship came to pick him up.But that didnt happen like last time.His shuttle came at Dosia at an entry angle and descended towards its surface.After a few horrific moments of bone shattering terror, the turbulence subsided and the ship leveled off.It settled down gently and the door opened a minute later.He released himself from the harnesses and walked to the open doorway.He was in a concrete jungle of white and gray buildings.His ship had set down in a courtyard with a fountain and small neatly manicured patches of blue grasses.All around him were benches and each one had a creature on it.A big Beetar with flowing robes approached and ushered him from the ship.Youre ruining the view, human.Get off the ship so I can send it away.He walked from the ship with trepidation in each step.Everyone was staring at him like he was about to level the city or set them all on fire.If only they knew how frightened he was, theyd laugh at him.As soon as both feet hit the ground, the Beetar punched a code into a hidden keypad on the outside of the ship and it closed up.He walked twenty feet away, and when Zero didnt make a move to follow him he yelled, Get over here or itll melt you into a puddle.He felt the heat from the thrusters of the ship and jogged over to the aggressive Beetar.He turned in time to see it lift off, and watched as it quickly and silently vanished through the cloud layer.Where did you send it?The Beetar looked at him bemusedly.It looked like it was going to tell him he needed to learn his place or to stop asking questions, but instead it said, Its going into orbit for now, unless the mother ship calls it back.Are you Frad?Yes I am.You must be my protection.Yep.My names Zero.Forgive me for being so honest, but I was expecting someone a little more formidable.Were all built the same, sir.I know that.I wasnt talking about your external machinery.Oh.Its okay.Come with me and Ill get you up to speed on what I expect of you.Hopefully youre up for the challenge.The other creatures on the benches were Dosians.As he walked past one of them, he looked it over.It was tall and spindly, in a humanoid way.It looked like a prototypical Gray alien from the movies except it wasnt gray and its eyes had far more intelligence in them.Its skin was yellow with brown mottling.Its head was too big for its skinny body, but it had a mouth and two green eyes, little ears on both sides, and a thin nose.The nose had just one nostril though, so maybe it wasnt a nose at all.A shiny stream of translucent slime ran from its single nostril down its face.The more he stared at the sticky stream the more revolted he was.It winked at him and he almost jumped.The eyelid was transparent.Then its other lid closed.Each lid opened back up a split second apart.He gave it a wide berth when it did that, and its mouth curled into a cruel smile.It was amused by his cowardice.It stood up and turned his way, winking and blinking rapidly.Frad turned around and yelled at the Dosian, Knock that shit off.Hes new here.You bastards scare the shit out of everyone with that eye blinking crap.The Dosian smirked and said in a rough, crackly, Beetar inflected voice, I was just saying hello.Thats not how you say hi.Stop being a dick.The Dosian laughed in a high pitched, whiny voice, and turned from them to retake his or her seat.Frad said, Dont mind them.Theyre actually pretty funny when you get used to them.He liked Frad already.Maybe hed misjudged the Beetars.Frad seemed like a gutter mouthed Beetar with a happy go lucky nature that was infectious.He reminded him of a fisherman hed met once when he was a kid.That fisherman looked like he ate bullets for breakfast and punched people for fun, but when he spoke there was genuine joy in his voice.He was a man who enjoyed his own existence with an almost detached bemusement, like he just couldnt believe hed gotten lucky enough to live his life the way he did.Frad had that same quality about him.He was an everyman sort, except that he wasnt a man, he was a Beetar.Zero caught up to him and asked, What the hell is that slime running down their faces and why dont they clean it up?Its disgusting.They have overactive mucous membranes.And why should they clean it up just because it bothers you?The problem is yours.Youre the one that needs to adjust, not them.Variety is the spice of life.Embrace it.Zeros attempt at making small talk had backfired.Frad was right, of course.He was the newcomer.It was he who had to change his outlook.He had to duck down to get through the entryway of the building Frad led him into.Frad said, Ill get that widened.Let me know if this place needs to be modified and Ill get it done.Id hate for your fat ass to get stuck in a doorway just as gunmen come for me.He nodded, aware of how much he stood out in this place.The foyer of the building was open and elaborately decorated with alien plants and grasses dotting the concrete landscape.Some of the plants swayed and moved on their own.Statues loomed over them as they walked.He had no idea what the hell they depicted though.The planet was truly alien to him in every sense.A plant nipped at his arm as he passed it.Frad slapped it hard.Watch out for the plants on Dosia.Theyre assholes.He smiled, even though he felt nothing akin to humor.He wondered if his dread shone through his smile.Frad said, Lucky for you, Im stationed on the ground floor of the building.He was alluding to the fact that the stairs going up were too narrow for him, and the elevators were far too small for him to fit inside.They walked into a large room devoid of the plant life hed seen along the way.This is my office and domicile.Im almost always in here, so get acquainted with the layout.When I have to attend a meeting or a function, youll be the first to know.Have a seat at my desk and well chat.He sat down and broke the chair.Frad laughed and said, On second thought, just stand.Ill have a steel chair built to your specifications by tomorrow.Zero apologized and moved the wreckage aside with his foot.Frad said, You dont talk much, do you?I do.Im just nervous.Good.I want you to be on edge around here.Ive already had two attempts on my life in the past week.Ever since that debacle at Cogmore, the Dosians have rallied together in an attempt to shuck off Beetar influence.Its a shame.Were only here to help, but suddenly theyre looking at us like were the enemy.I was on Cogmore.I saw the way Beetars treated the Cogmores with my own eyes.He should not have said that.Frads smile wavered.My people are not always so kind when we are resisted.The Cogmores certainly presented a challenge.But that has nothing to do with why Im here.Dosia is being invited into a union with my people.Were not trying to subdue them or manipulate them to our own ends.Quite the contrary, were trying to help them advance to our level.He resisted the urge to ask if the Dosians were as eager about the union as the Beetars were.Frad continued, The empire is huge.One end of it doesnt behave exactly like the other.For the Dosians to equate Beetar/Cogmore relations the same as Beetar/Dosian relations is absurd.Its completely different.You see that, dont you?He was starting to.I can understand the difference.What you have to understand is that if Im killed down here, my people will treat it like an act of war.Everything Ive worked toward will be toppled with my death.I cant allow that.Zero pulled his guns out to show Frad exactly what was protecting him.I wouldnt worry about attacks.Ive got your back.He thought about turning his thrusters on too, but he knew that would probably burn the office to the ground.He expected Frad to clap or smile or something, but instead he stood up fearfully and said, How are you able to pull your weapons in my presence?I dont understand the question.He put the guns away and the hatches in his thighs cinched shut.Your programming shouldnt allow you to deploy your weapons around my people except in extreme cases where we need protection from an attacker.He had to think fast.Ive been through a lot, sir.Maybe my programming is wonky from all the battles Ive survived.He knew that was a lie, but he had to calm Frad down before he got worried enough to have him checked out.Frad sat again and said, They sent me a robot with buggy programming, huh?That sounds like something high command would do.Oh well, youll have to do.Just dont pull your guns out around me, okay?Yes sir.Stop calling me sir.Call me Frad.He nodded.He felt like a fool.Where will I be staying?Frad looked over his shoulder.Youll be staying here, in this room, with me.There are three chargers on the far wall back there.Oh.I know its unusual, but I cant risk you not being by my side if an attack occurs.I understand.Ill try to keep to myself.Nonsense.Do whatever you want, as long as you stand between me and the bullets.A smile crept across his face.He was liking Frad more and more.He stood up and said, I need to urinate.Zero nodded and waited for him to leave.He started to walk from the office.You have to come with me.Oh, yeah.Sorry.Dont be.Youll get used to this.He followed him back out into the foyer and then through a door.He went inside and told him to take his post outside the doorway until he was done.He wasnt sure what to do, so he blocked it from anyone who might have wanted to go in.Passing Dosians ogled him fearfully and took a wide berth around him.One foolish Dosian tried to squeeze past him, until it felt a hand on its chest gently shoving it backwards.It hissed an indecipherable language at Zero, but eventually left.After a few minutes, Frad returned.Good job, Zero.I was using Dosian security before you got here, but those assholes would just wander off whenever they got bored.Were going to get along just fine.He thought so too.He stood guard outside the office door for an hour and then, when it was clear no threats were imminent, wandered inside and took up a post at the back of the room.He saw a pantry tucked away in the corner and a makeshift bed along the wall towards the back.Frad carried himself well, but he was living like a college freshman.There was a little steel door set into the floor that he assumed was a panic room in case he was ever overrun by enemies.Frad sat at his desk and conducted teleconference calls all day, sometimes speaking to Dosians in their language and sometimes in Beetar.When he spoke in Beetar, Zero could understand what he said.He was explaining to various groups of Dosians how mutually beneficial an alliance with the Beetars could be, both financially and intellectually.He also spent some time explaining that threats on his life were no longer an issue.He tilted his camera Zeros way to show them he was there to protect him.He explained that since he was here, talks could resume and must resume quickly.He heard him mention high command on more than one occasion, and each time his voice strained, like he hated to bring it up.Zero started to daydream a couple of times, but he caught himself before his mind wandered too far.He had to be ready for anything.He had to stay alert.Frads life depended on it.Frad stood from his chair and approached, saying, I think you should recharge.But  what if you come under attack?Its getting dark outside, and Dosians, being cold blooded, dont operate well at night.Plus, I want you at your best, and if your battery is depleted youre not going to perform optimally.Zero nodded and went to the back wall where the charging ports were mounted.He backed into one of them and heard it hiss as it connected with his body.He felt nothing, but he knew Frad probably expected him to shut down as he charged, so he let his head droop and he closed his eyes, mimicking the offline pose.Frad sighed and whispered, Why did they have to send me a dumbass?It took every ounce of Zeros willpower to keep still as Frad criticized him.He knocked on his hip, which was probably as high as Frad could reach on his mammoth body.Then he felt him pull on his gun hatch.He assumed he was checking to see if hed rigged his hatches so theyd open at any time, regardless of whose company he was in.Frad seemed satisfied when the hatches stayed in place.Then he heard him shuffle off, rustle around for a few minutes, and then he was silent.He must have gone to bed.The hatch issue almost became a problem.He could only guess it was another software modification Henshaw had installed in him.Or maybe he had malfunctioned, like hed told Frad.Hed been modified by Henshaw and by the Cogmores, so it stood to reason that those alterations could play havoc with the rest of his systems.He was glad Frad hadnt overreacted and insisted on shutting him down.As he stood there, hooked to the wall, immobile, he fell asleep.He didnt know he could still do that, but it felt great to give his confused mind a rest.He awoke to Frad unplugging him from the wall.He had a handheld tablet that he was hooking up to the port Zero had been hooked to.Frad explained, I can extrapolate data from the power source.None of you know this, but data is relayed back to the ports as you charge so we can monitor your progress.We only ever do this in extreme cases, though.So why are you doing it to my port?He paused and looked up at him.I need to find out if your database has been intentionally corrupted.I need to find out if youve been sent to kill me.Why would I do that?Its not a stretch of the imagination to think high command might have sent you to kill me and then pin my death on the Dosians to instigate war.No way.I thought Beetars wanted to coexist with the Dosians?You dont know my people.They want this alliance whether the Dosians want in on it or not.Were going the diplomatic route now, but if that fails well get what we want through force.Frad stared at the screen, tapped a few buttons, and then threw the tablet at his feet in disgust.Nothing works around here.Your port didnt record any info.Thank God for that.The last thing he wanted was for Frads paranoia to have any basis in reality.He was glad his battery didnt actually connect to the charger, or else Frad would know everything hed done, and probably trust him even less than if he found out he was an assassin.He was worse than a hit man: he was so incompetent that he got those around him killed.Frad said, I guess were just going to have to trust one another, then.No one screwed with my programming before I came here.Im here to save your life, not end it.I hope thats right.Id hate to die for the Beetar cause.It doesnt sound to me like youre behind your people or their agenda.Frad shrugged, his weird shoulders making a slurping sound as they moved.My people dont know what they want.But they always want more.Their greed is their bane, but also their one saving grace.Greed has led them to the forefront of discovery.It has opened up whole new worlds and made the galaxy a smaller, more organized place.But greed is selfish and headstrong.Greed for its own sake is chaos.My people step on either side of that line all the time.Im just waiting and watching to see which side they eventually fall on.He didnt know what the hell he was talking about specifically, but he had the gist of it figured out.What will you do if the Beetars end up disappointing you?I dont know.Maybe Ill cut ties with them.Maybe Ill work to right the wrongs they cause.But more likely Ill take the cowards way out and just go on living my life and adjusting my morals to suit my needs.Frad rolled his shiny black eyes and said in a hushed whisper, Youre not recording this, are you?I wouldnt know how, even if I could.I suppose it doesnt matter.
