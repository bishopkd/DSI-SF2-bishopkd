I snatch her up and push her against the wall face first to stun her.With a little pressure to the back of one knee, she falls forward.I drive my knee in her back and twist one of her arms behind her so its coiled with enough tension that if she tries to escape, itll snap.Now either I can recollect Kanes pain from that memory and share it with you, or you can tell me what you know about that girl right now.She grunts and I apply more pressure to her arm.Shes air, like you, I say.And do you know every orphan?!she says through gritted teeth.Of course not.I twist.Shes an orphan!she nearly screams.Just like you.I whip her around on her back.Pin her with my arm across her throat, my weight and legs restraining the rest of her body.She makes orphan into such a hateful word.She doesnt flinch.I look for the signs: fluctuation of pupils, expansion of the nostrils, perspiration, faint twitching of the eyelids.Nothing.Shes not lying, I dont think.Not a drop of sweat or an off beat in her heart.Even if shes telling the truth, Ill still make her pay.But right now, she doesnt matter.Only Kane does.You just find this memory and you dont question why?Why it was there for you?And your first instinct was to give it to me?Of all people?When she finally speaks, her voice is a shadow of itself, her song gone.I know how you feel about me, and I hate you even more.But youre the only one who can help him.Id do it, but thats not possible in my position.Everyone knows me.But no one thinks twice about a ...She doesnt dare call me that again.People think twice after they get roughed up.Youre still in love with him, I say.This time, her pupils flare.Theres a hitch in her breath.She needs me, I know that now.She needs me and she hates that.I need her too, and I hate it even more than she does.I take a deep breath.What do you know?Will you let go of me already?I get up off her and she rolls away, massaging her throat.She pulls herself to standing and straightens her uniform.I couldnt find out much, even in Security.He was sent to assassinate her, but Im not sure why.Assassinate and Kane.Those words dont go together.Hes the perfect choice, really, she says, regaining her crustiness.They had him on the construction rigs with proper air rights authority doing surveillance.He was monitoring this island for weeks.I have enough clearance to get his memory, obviously, or I wouldnt be here.Saw you two planning this meeting.Saw a great deal of you both, in fact.She looks disgusted.Cute moment with the boosters, she adds.She just cant help herself, even now.In terms of strategy, I understand why they chose Kane.Especially considering his talents.Who else could fit in on a rig?One step from mudpeople, those rig workers.Could tell a nonbuilder on sight.And Kane has the uncanny ability to keep from ruffling feathers.Even those of a rigger.The riggers truly are the last of the air outlaws.How the IHC has allowed them to coexist with their society is an unimaginable feat.From what Ive heard, theyre practically scavs.Except they maintain the functionality of all the Islands and do all the jobs that the rest of proper society finds beneath them.Kane can be slick, but entrenched with a bunch of pseudo scavs?Its almost too much.Yet to Cassina, it just is.Youre either air, or youre not.For the first time, I see her as the IHC higher ups must.Sure of herself.Someone able to assert authority.The kind of person you trust to make things happen.I dont trust her one bit, of course.But right now, shes all I have.The only way to get to Kane.They probably put Kane on a rig near her island.I dont know for sure.They were careful to block those areas of his memory.Seems logical, though.That way he could observe her, get to know her habits.Then attend her ball.Emergence Ball, I say.Kane told me about them.All the island girls have one.She sighs.Except me, of course.I was already at the Academy.But Kane knows how they go.Hes from the air as well.You see?He was the perfect choice.Where is sheLivianow?They have her quarantined on Helix.No one knew about Kanes assignment, after all.A great many of Indras Most Importance were there that evening and Im sure the gossip is flying.Everyone discussing her attack by an uninvited guest, contemplating the threat to all the Islands.They have to put up a show of protecting her safety.Her safety.Its so messed up I almost laugh.Theyll keep her there for a while, I suppose.Make a big deal of investigating the incident.What else do you know about her?Livia?I told you already.Theres not much to know.Upper born and raised.She sticks to herself.Reclusive.She was never like the rest of us.I mean, what do you expect?After all, shes just  What?I dont know much else, she says.Just shut up then, I say.And let me think.Cassina goes silent.I pace the Archive room.There isnt time to weigh the options.Not that there are any.Ill go after that girl.Shell lead me to Kane.Theres no other way.When I dont report for Rock Bottom Patrol, theyll come after me.Theyll put me in confinement, maybe worse.But thats a risk Im willing to take.A placement doesnt matter much, not compared to this.Kane needs me, I tell myself.And this is what I need: to find Livia Cosmo.Make that conniving airgirl suffer.How will I get to her?I ask Cassina.I have a plan, she says.Why else would I be here?14           Rock Bottom Patrol Day 1: AWOL   Lex   I found the uniform right where Cassina told me, folded neatly on the floor of Kanes studio.How did she know about the Center of Creation?Of course.She saw it in Kanes memory.The idea of her watching and seeing us made me feel naked.Did she see the kiss, too?I pushed the thought aside and slipped on my new identity.Moments later, I was in the PCF carrier shed arranged to pick me up at the edge of the Academy gates.It hadnt been easy getting there unseen, but Kane and I had found all the dark places long ago, the forgotten hallways and hidden corners.I only had to remember them.I slipped into the abandoned carrier.Held my breath, put my thumb to the printscan.The Academy gates swung open and we rumbled forward.The synth print worked, just like shed said.She said she had it made in the High Council labs, by a friend there who could be trusted.A duplicate of her very own thumbprint.With my high level position, you should have no problem with access.The print is infused with a liquid reserve of my DNA, but at some point, it will run out.So move quickly.Cassina might be a cold, heartless airgirl, but she was good with details.Id give her that.The more ground I put between me and the Academy, the more I realize Ive been here before.Or maybe just a place like it.I remember seeing the patrol towers after leaving the Orphanage.The armed soldiers safeguarding the darkness, me trapped inside the transporter with Recruiter, on my way to my new life.Id been burning with questions then.Now Im possessed with a different type of fire.Everything is the same here, only smaller.Everything is the same.Except for me.I park the carrier and board the train at the nearest commuter station, amidst the Hubbers headed home after a nights work.A few PCF are scattered throughout my compartment.I keep waiting to be noticed.For a voice to tell me I dont belong.The voice doesnt come.All it takes is a uniform and I can be like everyone else.If thats the secret to life, I should just give up now.The doors slide shut and the hiss of pressure sealing them gets my attention.The transporter gains full velocity quickly, but my heart gets there quicker.We shoot into oblivion.Theres nothing out there for miles and miles.Then, there is the Hub.Id always imagined the Hub as enormous.I was wrong.Enormous isnt a big enough word.I look up.Somewhere above me, this endless cavern actually ends, where the Lower Levels become the Upper.Ill believe it when I see it, I think.Then I remember how soon that will be.There are so many layers of strata, so much rock and iron.Someone thought this up.Someone planned this.My own life is so small compared to this.There are a lot of loose ends that dont add up.Cassinas father, the sudden arrival of PCF to beat down Kane.Orders from someone who knew where to assassinate Livia Cosmo, and just why did Kane agree to it?But I push those out of my head.Right now, I have one clear mission.Make that two: find Kane and demolish Livia Cosmo.Ive seen the Hub only in holo images, but theres no time for sightseeing.Not that you can ignore the place.How they managed to hollow out this much of the earth is astonishing.The Orphanage wasnt big on science facts and the Academy only built soldiers, but they say over a million people travel through the Hub daily, primarily via tube transporters.Theres a steady stream of roaring transporters of all sizes, the traffic directed by a complex system of flashing lights, monitors, and security borders.Once you step into the Hub, your audiofeed, if youre wearing oneand it looks like everyone isis co opted to constantly update you with traffic announcements and scheduling advisements.We were never allowed audiofeeds at the Orphanage and only for simulated missions at the Academy, which I prefer.I have too much already going on in my head.Plus this tremendous cavern is a wall of light and sound.Youd think it would be easy to just be a face in the crowd, but Im sure security cameras are concealed everywhere.Everyone races to their destinations.Ive never seen so many bodies.A continuous swarm of gray and blue uniforms that moves at the same pace, that maneuvers with military like precision.I welcome the anonymity that joining them grants.For a second, I imagine Kanes Book of Indra, with its jolt of whirling colors.I feel like I havent seen color since Ive seen him.I think of Kane painting my laugh.I think mostly of Kanes lifeless body.I hop a Hub transporter for a transfer transporter before most of Indra is awake, and move on from that to a tunnel transporter.Seems like Hubbers spend half their time getting somewhere and the other half getting back.At every interval, I hold my breath, worried the DNA reserve on Cassinas synth print will run out.Each time, the entrance whooshes open.But will I ever actually get anywhere?Maybe the Upper Levels are a myth.A mass illusion.That would be a cruel trick.I stare out the window, watching all this newness pass me by.Maybe Im not going anywhere at all.The shuttle jolts forward.We stop.More people get on.We stop.People get off.Sector Geode, says the mechanical speakerfeed.Sector Magna.Sector Limestone.Sector Granite.Sector Obsidian, the speakerfeed finally announces.Final stop.All passengers must disembark.The tunnel is just how Cassina described.Hardly big enough for one person.If I extend my arms, I can touch the sides.Rock and sediment encircle me, the hollowed out path continuing in front of me.Only a few people have access, Cassina told me.Ive checked the schedules and they will be otherwise engaged.That passage is only for others like me, those serving in  High level positions, I interrupted.I get it.Youre important.Important, but entirely correct about its emptiness.You will think it never ending, said Cassina.But then it will.I almost smack into the transparent plexi clear wall.Thanks for mentioning that.It requires my thumbprint.The locking seal lets loose a pressurized burst as the entrance slides open.The PCF patroller is waiting, as planned.Will you know how to fly it?Cassina asked me.I answered that one with just a look.If I know one thing, its how to work a machine.My apprenticeship so far has allowed me access to sim lessons on all SpecOps transporters.I tug the door open.The hatch releases like an exhale and I pull myself up into the cabin and latch the side closed.I strap myself into the shiny black seat and pop on the pilots helmet.Then one more use of the thumbprint.This is how I felt the first time on my air speeder.I had her roaring while the other cadets were still snapping on their riding gear.The controls arent too dissimilar, just more ...complex.A lot more.You dont need flight training if youre assigned to Rock Bottom.Good thing I put in some extra work.Ive always set my sights a little higher.I prime the ignition and the twin engines wake up, one at a time.The power that hums through it also hums through me.Im careful not to get carried away.This sucker does vertical takeoff and landing.I keep an eye on the gyroscope to make sure the weight is evenly distributed.I program the coordinates.It charts the flight path to Helix Island.The enormous ceiling panels above slide open and red lights begin to flash.I look up.There it is.Sky.No booster could ever give you a rush like this.I lift my visor, just for a second, and its like my eyeballs catch fire.Real light, bursting off the sides of real buildings as I rise into the open air.The City of Indra.The tower of the Independent High Council at its center, rising above it all.There are spires equally as beautiful.This is the world I have always lived under, I think.Now I can really see it.No holo image could prepare me for this.The worlds a much bigger place than I could ever have imagined.I glide the craft forward and up.I control her just like my speeder.I could get used to this.Upping the speed and engaging the turbo gear, I might as well abuse my privileges as much as the rest of the PCF do.I overtake the transporters in my path and cut through a corridor of airscrapers and skytowers.I could get used to this, if I was willing to be corrupt.I round a corner and accelerate straight for a massive floating rig.I swoop beneath its shadowy mechanical underbelly.The maze of tubing and gears sways, the whole thing threatening to topple at any moment.A swift upward boost and I merge with the sunlight.Ahead theres a new building under construction.I plunge headfirst, coasting through support frames, and shoot out the other side.The rigs assignment, I figure.Luckily they havent finished construction or my shortcut wouldve turned into a dead end.Im higher now, closer to the top of the dome that encases the city.Below me, the City of Indra spreads out like a holomap.I grew up in the air, Kane once said.Its not really that great, not really.I guess its time to see for myself.I point the nose of the patroller upward, check the coordinates, and pull the accelerator back as far as it goes.My ears pop and I head above everything.15           After the Emergence Ball   Livia   From my isolated summit, I watch the world keep going without me.Every transporter that passes, the very few that are allowed in our airspace, is one that passes me by and leaves me stranded here.In the main quarters, Marius takes tea in the parlor with an Indrithian of Importance, maids posted at corners on high alert to refill saucers and replenish trays of sweet cakes.While the visitor sips, Marius speaks to my outstanding qualities, the likes of which I cannot imagine ever existed.When forced to address the unfortunate events of my ball, she speaks low, glossing over extraneous details.Clichs, she believes, are best suited for these moments.The poor thing, she says.A victim of circumstance.Events beyond reasonable control.The surprises life has to offer!she adds cheerily.And now we must move forward to discover exciting new horizons.There are no horizons in the air, of course.But those are pesky details, and shes focused on a much larger task: saving me from complete ruin.If pressed for specifics, shes evasive.No, they dont have any information.A disgruntled Young Man with flawed genetics, I suspect.Yes, an island boy, but with rather unique circumstances.Deceased mother, reclusive father.Terribly unfortunate situation.Perhaps if the signs had been more obvious?She shakes her head and sighs at the injustice.Then, with a sip of tea, she diverts the conversation to topics of real importance.My tiny waist, I suppose.My pleasant demeanor.These are the details she hopes theyll remember.I know all this because I have listened, ear to the wall of the adjoining pantry.Ive been suitably impressed with Mariuss gift for strategy.Unfortunately, like former earth, even she cant strategize her way out of complete catastrophe.Between this guest and the last, she sent out inquiry feeds, tracking down cohabitants who have yet, for some inexplicable reason, to hear the specifics of my disastrous debut.She embarks on extended, utterly polite conversations with anyone privy to a Proper Young Man of cohabitable age.Perhaps we can arrange a rendezvous?Livia would be pleased to engage in private platform rotation for the suitable gentleman.So far, gratefully, no one has taken her up on the offer.Governess has been sent away on retreat.In need of a rest, Marius said.But Im not an imbecile; this is no relaxing holiday lounging in Rejuvenation Islands gardens, sipping vitamin cocktails.She began sobbing at first sight of my bloodstained dress; it didnt cease for three days.I held her hand and spoke reassuring words, even going so far as to keep vigil by her sleeper.In the few times she acknowledged me, it was only to ask questions: Did you finish your pudding, Livia dear?Did you have a lovely time playing in the gardens?Once or twice she grew serious, but her eyes remained distant as she reached for me.You must be careful not to fall when climbing trees, she said fearfully, grasping my hand tightly with her shaky grip.We wouldnt want another scrape, my dear.I wiped tears from her faraway eyes and listened to her mutter of reprogramming the orchards, her sobs reduced to a steady whimper.Enough, said Waslo on the fourth day.He was in the doorway, but he refused to meet my eyes, just merely shook his head before exiting as abruptly as he entered.That was his only word to me since that evening in Vedas stable.Sunrise Retreat Island.I know thats where theyve sequestered Governess.Shes in lockdown, undergoing emotional readjustments and electron regulation.Her sleeper pod is under constant surveillance, and so is the rest of her.In her greatest time of need, I cant return the comfort and support shes given me.For all the time spent improving the physical, no science has mastered repairing the mind.I have failed her.Sunrise Island is rarely mentioned in polite company, though Indrithians know its reputation.A horror no one wishes to visit, even worse than Paradise Holiday, where Hubbies retreat.Lower Levelers will slave away their lifetimes for the honor of being granted a visit to Paradise Island.The best two days of their life, not that theyll remember with the abundance of refreshments.The most powerful of which, Hub suds, are a vision inducing, mind altering beverage.Its said you can smell the vomit from several islands away.At least, according to the rumors.At this point, I would take either over Helix.I used to be considered unmanageable; now Im unmanageable and unappealing.Even the synth treesfittingly programmed for beautiful fall huesseem to wilt at my disgrace.I avoid Marius, fearing the pity in her eyes.It was not your fault, she told me.You are the victim here.Victim or not, no Proper Young Man would dare touch me now with the shame Ive brought to my name.Its my awful, selfish dream come true.Helix Island is now as tainted as my legacy.Ive come to understand Ill be one of those women who never cohabitate.A freethinker, which is a polite way to say outcast.Theyre rarely seen in public, succumbing to a life of seclusion, destined to pay in loneliness for their lack of options.No one chooses to be a freethinker.Marius, of course, wont accept my fate so willingly.A Young Man with a small estate, she tells me distractedly.Looks promising.His pastime is fencing.I have been told he has a rather nice disposition.Nice, I know, means a stutter or chronic odor or an even more serious deficiency.But even those Young Men wont agree to meet, avoiding me like a genetic flaw.Your name and island are all you have, and one doesnt stand without the other.Below in the City of Indra, Waslo heads up the investigation.Despite his reassurance, Waslo rarely leaves the Councils chambers.The Islands, already predisposed to juicy gossip, are on high alert for strange occurrences.Im prohibited from leaving Helix, not that I would be welcomed in any other location.The maids avoid me.The garden crew hasnt returned since the oaks changed colors.Following the ball, Life Guide resigned abruptly, bags already in hand as he broke the news to Marius.Perhaps you shall take a brief hiatus from educational endeavors, Marius informed me.He never taught me anything important anyway, I responded.She ignored me.Master has ceased his visits as well, as is standard of leisure pastime instructors following a debut.Strangely enough, I miss him the most, despite his mysterious advice and bizarre riddles.Etiquette lessons end with your ball, the ultimate goal being cohabitation.I failed, just as Etiquette Tutor always predicted.For once, I have lived up to her expectations.I avoid my fathers study and my mothers air harp.My zinger hangs by my sleeper.Since coming into my possession, its never been so silent.I take it into the fields with me, but it never leaves its sheath.Im alone now, except for Veda.When I asked Marius about him, I was sure to be offhanded, aiming to convey a sense of innocent curiosity.He is being detained at Council headquarters, she said sharply.I have never heard Marius speak with such harshness, and knew to avoid all future inquiries about the stranger.Even if he never strays far from my thoughts.I could stand here in silence all day, peering into the clouds, and I doubt anyone would notice.Designated edges no longer exist, as there is nothing of value in need of protection.Perhaps my newly won nonexistence is to blame for my curious turn in thought.There are so many questions I shouldnt want answered, yet still, I do.Moments I should resist contemplating, yet I long to dwell in their details.I seek distraction.I walk to the edge of Helix every day now, and no one discourages this.The make believes they told me about the traps and secret hazards are no longer threatening.The world is far more dangerous and frightening than they ever prepared me for.Today I go for a walk without Veda.That way it will keep me away from the main quarters for that much longer.Anything to calm my mind of the incessant whirling.I even go so far as to keep up with Life Guides favored educational topics.I ponder Indrithian history, only to find myself pondering the details of his face.Were his eyes blue or brown?Was there a twist in his smile?Indra Evolution and Society becomes a study of his lips on mine; Customs and Rituals the sound of his laugh.He did laugh, did he not?And was his kiss as soft as I remember?I am less sure of what I know with each passing day.He tried to kill you, I chastise myself.Yet he changed his mind, I reason.Perhaps this is what happens when you are left to your own devices.If this continues, theyll send me off to where Governess has gone.Maybe we can do the double mental meltdown special at Sunrise Island.Something must happen soon, I think, looking out toward the clouds.And there it is, flying straight at me.16           Lex   Its pretty hard to forget the face of someone you hate.Recruiter.Cassina.Livia Cosmo.The wind blows at her white dress, making her look like another cloud here at the edge of her island.Shes beautiful.Untouchable, like the rest of us are far beneath her.In a way, I guess we are.Ill be the first to touch herand Ill make sure it hurts.I pinpoint a thicket of trees and I keep my eye on the gyroscope as I take her in for a landing.Its bumpy, but I dont do any permanent damage to the craft or myself.The Islands are beautiful.Thats what they say.I step out of the craft, but I dont see it.Everything is a chemical green.Too bright and totally fake, like in the Archives.The Archives were built to replicate reality, and now instead reality imitates the Archives.Its as if I could just pull out a chip and this all would melt away.The air makes me dizzy, and after a few steps, before Im out of the thicket, I pause for a breath.Whys it so hard to breathe here?My head swims and it feels like my feet are no longer touching the ground.Remember the task, Lex.I peel off the PCF uniform, and just the fit of the black skintight silitex underneath calms me.Im myself again.Im still strong, even up here.I just need a few moments....I adjust my straps and replay my objectives: Find Kanes location.Rescue Kane.Seek retaliation, then kick her ass.Sure, she did damage to Kane, but Im an army of one.Ill break her.Someone wanted this airgirl dead.I dont know why, and I dont care.Either way, Ill finish the job.Im coming, Kane.I painted her with my tracker beam on the way in, and checking in on her now, she hasnt moved far.My blaster has a full charge.I take a deep breath as I emerge from cover.Shes hard to miss.Just standing there, her back turned.Waiting for me.Within seconds, Ive got her in a stranglehold.She never saw me coming.Doesnt struggle.Living this high up, she thinks shes above human pain.Nothing can harm you in the air, right?It could be blood rushing to my head, since there are no fumes up here.Only ...oxygen.Maybe its just her stupid face, but for a moment, I forget what I came for.Focus.Just focus.Kane, grinning at me on boosters.Painting my laugh.Kane, unconscious, battered like a busted up zip ball.Tell me where they took him, air bitch, I growl.Tell me where they took Kane or Im gonna  I dont get to finish.Shes reached for something, something on her back.A sword.Pointed at my neck.Shes got a sword and its singing.You, she says, are in desperate need of an etiquette lesson.17           Livia   The realization is startling: someone has arrived with the intent to murder me.Again.Ive never witnessed an individual of such unique appearance.This, to be sure, is no Proper Young Woman.Her garb is a scandalously formfitting shiny black.Stealth is surely not her priority.Its a uniform of some sort, perhaps, though I couldnt begin to imagine her official duties beyond violence.Shes perfect in a way Ive never seen, every inch of her wild, from her fierce expression to her untamed hair.Im rather sure she has never undergone an alteration, though on first glance, I did suspect a chest enhancement.Ive never sensed another so strongly; she pummels me without even touching, her attempt to blindside me spoiled as she began her approach.She glares and I stare back, curious.My zinger, shiny tip pointed at the softest part of her neck, is no longer silent.It has never touched real flesh.Its faint tune is almost bloodthirsty.A few seconds pass, yet it seems a lifetime.Her lifetime.It could be over in a few more seconds, if I wish it.I feel her confusion and fear and focus, but her loyalty is powerful enough to kill for.It will kill her.Im not a killer, but I refuse to be a victim.Theres a sudden change, so quick I almost dont catch it.Within an instant, a frigid void takes over where emotion had just been.She speaks through clenched teeth, making it almost impossible to understand her.If she even hopes to survive Etiquette, shell need to pass Elocution first.Excuse me, I say calmly.But might you speak up?Im having a rather difficult time understanding you.She narrows her eyes and says, Put away the sword.Absolutely not, I say as my zinger lets out a stream of low notes.Your first instinct was to strangle me.You should lose your hands for that alone.Im not going to tell you again, she says.Perhaps I should start with your tongue.Put down the  I raise my eyebrows, noting her abilities in Conversational Intercourse are limited as well.Ive fought opponents in the Archives far more dangerous than you, I say.So you would do well to compose yourself, perhaps take a deep breath first, and then we might have a rational      Lex   My pacifiers shut up island girl quick.I pull them from my belt, one rod in each hand, and as soon as I extend them, they flicker awake and electricity singes the air.One touch and shell be out.On the ground, stunned into submission.Best of all?She wont be able to talk.I kind of love Rock Bottom Patrol, I think.For my new weapons alone.Startled, she stumbles back.Shes never felt anything like the pacifiers before.Her face changes from polite to pissed.Her sword shrieks, like I offended it.You wont put it down?I say.So guess what?I have to make you.I rush her.The pacifiers surge, spiraling blue bursts of high voltage.She draws her arm back, raising her sword.She looks like an idiot and I wish her sword would shut up.The sword arcs down as I reach her and she cuts one of my pacifiers in half.I raise it to fend off another swing, and its halved again.I let the stub fall from my hand.It couldve really used a reinforced shaft.Cassina shouldve mentioned a sword, or at the very least weapons training.Still, she plays her tricks inside of tricks.Mental note: Kick airgirls ass first, then Cassinas.She looks at the other pacifier, still sparking.A smug smile; shes confident in her abilities.So am I.   The instant before she slices, I hurl my remaining pacifier at her face.It hits her above the eye and she shrieks.Lets see how well she responds to that.Her bodys frozen from the shock.I step into her waist and flip her.She may be tall, but she falls like everyone else.Shes on the ground, eyes wide.Her bodys still processing the current: your heart skips a beat after you get stunned, and your muscles contract so tightly and hurt so much you might just burst.This was all part of my apprenticeship.Ive felt this pain.I put my knee to her sword arm.Dont worry your pretty little head, airgirl, I say, applying pressure inside the elbow.Her hand pops open, sword falling out of it.Not singing now, huh?I say.That feeling you have lasts for five minutes in an adult male.Youll have plenty of time to think.Heres something to consider: What I did to your elbow just now?Thats a pressure point.Push my knee a little harder, snap.Id have broken your arm.I like her much better now that she cant respond.The convulsions have died down, and now she just spasms every now and then.I reach for her sword.The instant I touch the handle, the blade explodes with noise.Shut up!I yell.I cant believe I yelled at a sword.The noise doesnt stop, and my eardrums pound, ready to burst.I hurl it as far as I can and it lands high up in the branches of a tree.Silence, finally.Past the trees, the island keeps going.Back the other way, the edge becomes endless sky.Kind of strato, I think.Yknow, I say, unable to pull my eyes away from the view, with some whole other island orbiting this one very slowly in the distance.Right now I could kill you in sixteen different ways.Then pick one.I whip around.Airgirl is on her feet.Impossible, I think.No one can recover that quick.Shes not even disoriented.Shes already moving.Leaping, actually.For a second, she seems to hover.Her elbow lifted, hand held rigid.This time the pose isnt as funny.Thwack!My neck snaps sideways.Another strike and my face burns.Then a sharp blow to my gut knocks me off my feet.What the hell?This airgirl is full of surprises.Synth grass looks soft, but it isnt.Not really.Not enough to cushion my fall.My head aches; Im dizzy and it was hard enough to breathe before the air got knocked out of me.I open my eyes.Airgirl is above me blocking out every piece of sky except the clouds dancing around her head.She smiles.I suppose you were correct, she says.Perhaps I dont need the sword.She narrows her eyes.My hands and feet are sufficient.In fact, I could kill you in sixteen different ways with them.I need not resort to the aid of sticks.Her smile fades into something sinister.Now I know for sure Ive been set up.This isnt another uppity cloudcase.This girl is dangerous and flat out crazy.Dont forget, I think.Youre PCFs finest.Shes still looking at me, her head cocked to the side.Nodding, like she hears me thinking.Oh, she says, I see youre anxious for more.I open my mouth, then answer with my right foot.It catches across her mouth and splits her bottom lip at the corner.She puts her thumb to it and it comes away with blood.She seems more interested than upset.Then the interest turns to fury.Eyes narrowed, nostrils flared, she stares at me, lips pinched and breath quickening.Classic signs of distress.All I see is vulnerability.She steps back, stands straight, chin lifted: that pose ...again.Shes tall, I think.Like, freakishly tall.Shes ready to strike.The whole thing, mouth kick to strike ready, takes a split second.But I catch every detail.Im on my feet before she launches.That was for Kane, I spit, fists raised.And this is for me.I throw a closed fist to her belly, going low on purpose to catch her off guard.She never expected that.Airgirls dont lower themselves to anyone.She lurches forward with a groan, and Im waiting to meet her.I head butt her hard enough that I hear her brains scramble.She grips her forehead and stumbles backward.All those sims shes probably battled through, probably none of them taught her to fight dirty.Ive got her now.Livia   I reach out, wrapping this wild girl in my angry embrace, and we collapse together.If I fall, then you shall come with me, I think.I grip her as we roll across the grass, digging the newly sharpened tips of my nails into her bodysuit.The girl screams in pain.You were correct, Governess, I think, as we flip over and over, a pre debut manicure does fill one with a sense of accomplishment.While unique in appearance, her attire hasnt been designed for synth grass.She slides and skims, trying to find purchase where there is none.Within moments, Ive positioned her beneath me, the sharp point of my knee hammering her rib cage, an impromptu variation of a jujitsu mount that would make a true sensei cringe in horror.True, Im not following the rules of civilized combat, but Ive come to believe she didnt know these rules existed in the first place.Shes on my level, but not my equal.Shes forced my hand and now I have no option: regrettably, I must decimate her.Regrettable for her, that is.She groans in pain, which brings me great satisfaction.She reaches upward for me and I push down her arms.She grasps only air.I reach for her wild mane of hair.I believe its safe to conclude, I say, grabbing two generous fistfuls, that you dont adhere to the standard social graces.I yank with all my might.She bites her bottom lip, a sad attempt to contain the screams.I give you permission, I tell her sympathetically, to express your obvious discomfort and start by begging for forgiveness.Instead, she narrows her eyes, glaring at me with blatant disgust.In that moment, my zinger moans from a nearby location, uttering a single, lonely note.In that same moment, she begins shrieking.Where is he?she says.Who?Im thinking she means Kane.Kane, she says.And how exactly would I have such information?I feel a small rivulet of blood making its way to the corner of my mouth.I have no idea how this fight started.An utter breech of etiquette, I decide, for one to bleed alone.A quick strike to her nose and now we bleed together.She fights through the pain, as if it doesnt pain her as much.Perhaps these ones get their nerves neutered.You know where he is, she says.Tell me now or Ill hurt you even worse.I dont believe youre in a position to threaten, I say calmly.She attempts to wiggle out from beneath me, so I reach for her hair once again.I give it a firm tug, and this time she cannot help but howl.The pain must be excruciating, I say.Perhaps I should allow you a moment to recoup?I ease my grip, offering a brief respite.The next pull is even harder.I look down, surprised to be holding a clump in each hand.I dispose of these, immediately reaching for another helping.Master would never condone this kind of fighting, deeming it Without elegance or strategy.Demeaning to both you and opponent.Easy for him to say.He has probably never fought for his life.She rolls backward abruptly, surprising me.Unexpected indeed, I think, just before the front of her boots slam into my face.Lex   She smacked me across the face.Held me down and spit insults, not that I understood half of the uppity air talk.But Im pretty sure it wasnt compliments.She pulled my hair.Pulled out my hair.Even the cadet groomer wouldnt dare go that far.Now Ill teach her my language.No words required.We go round and round, circling each other like wolves.I saw them in the Archive once: ragged and starving, growling, teeth bared.Then they ate one another.Tell me where he is, I say.And supposing I was privy to knowledge of this young mans location  Kane, I bark.His name is Kane.I think I see the flicker of a smile.No doubt about it: the girl is evil.This Kanes elusive whereabouts.Why would I choose to share that information?Especially with you.You sounds like a curse word.Because he might die.And youll be a murderer.Listen to yourself, she says.He came to kill me, not the other way around.I charge her, but she sidesteps so quickly Im grabbing air.She lives in it.Might be made of it, too.He was charming, Ill grant you that.But he tried to poison me with a kiss.Did he force that on you like you sicced those PCF bastards on him?You beat him senseless, but you wanted him lifeless, too?What a horrible, horrible lie, she says.I saw you!I lunge again.She springs away.Lunge, spring.Like this is a game to her.Shall we make a day of this?she asks.I stop, frustrated.Shes a few feet away now, pacing.Back and forth, eyes never straying from me, always moving.Completely, utterly restless.You werent there, she says sharply.I saw everything.How?The Archives, airgirl!Taken from his memory.I saw every single second.She stops pacing.She questions everything.She wouldve done well at the Academy.And from whom did you acquire this memory?I dont say anything.If you dont want to make this more than a misunderstanding, silence wont do.Every inch of me is burning.I no longer pump blood, but hatred.I push through the pain.Race for her.Shes too fast.Where did she go?I spin around.Shes gone.Evaporated into the air.I hear music.Really crappy music.Damn.She got the singing sword back.I got tricks too, airgirl.I sprint, ducking behind a tree at the islands edge, then I activate my decoys just in time.Livia   I suspect you were looking for me, I say, lifting my zinger.She dares come to my island?The moment has arrived for her departure.I race for her, zinger first.She doesnt run.She simply watches me.I slice straight through her ...yet shes not there.Shes dissipated, only faint streaks of electric mist remaining.A decoy.Clever.I spin around, my chest hammering.Nothing.Here, says a voice.I turn and shes staring at me calmly.I rush toward her with fury, yet my zinger slices empty space.Another one.Not quite, she says.I pivot to find her again, this time grinning.Wanna give it another go?Or you could try me.There she is again, this time to the left of me.Shes also to the right.I have to slow down.Three of her bait me with identical smiles on identical faces.The projections are quite good, not a single glitch to ruin the illusion.Im left with no other option.I must feel the real one.Her anger and will were so overpowering before, but now?Nothing.Not even the tiniest flicker.Perhaps theyre all decoys.Theres only one way to find out.They all come at once.I stab at one and it dodges my zinger, the second advancing from the left.Blade still pointed at the first, I roundhouse kick the other.That one dissipates on impact.Fake.Next?I lift the zinger high and aim for the top of her head.Perfect form, yet the vertical cut slices through nothing.My blade plunges straight into the ground.Lex   Finally.Airgirl is going down.The decoys really got her.She reaches for her sword.Just as she pulls it from the dirt, I race from behind the tree.A kick to the arm and a series of punches to the head.One to the liver.Now shell really pay.I finish her off with a roundhouse kick to the chest.She flies backward, lands on the ground, and rolls right over the edge.Oh no ...Livia   I have my zinger in one hand, the rock edge in the other.Im digging in so hard, one of my nails breaks.The pain helps me focus.Suspended in space, the longer I hang, the weaker Ill get, and this ...whatever just happened has worn me out.What would normally be a gentle breeze only makes me dig in harder.Dont look down, I tell myself.I force myself to look up.The curling roots of the farthest synth tree have snaked through the soil and cracked through Helixs rocky foundation.Perhaps I might be able to reach them.This, unfortunately, will require both of my hands.Already once today Ive lost my zinger.Ill find it again, I think, lifting the blade.My grip begins to slip.Lex   My breathings ragged.The altitude is making me sick, and now that my adrenaline is crashing, Im discovering Im stunningly not okay with heights.So much open space above and below me.Ive lived below for far too long.Then that damn sword comes sailing toward me.It falls short and I know Ive underestimated my opponent once again.Good thing shes alive to still question.Bad thing that this fight will continue.She crawls over the edge of the island.I cant catch my breath.Ill let her come to me.See just who will back down first.I brace for impact and square up, but she still hits me hard.Were locked together on the ground, getting ugly.Ive got two fingers on her neck.Right on the artery.Shes trying to choke me.Its working remarkably well.I press this spot a little harder, youll be paralyzed, I say hoarsely.Youll never walk again, you hear me?Youll run out of air first, she says.We hold like this, bodies tensed, staring at each other.Thats when I see the symbol.Tiny as mine.In the same spot on her iris.We have the same marking.Her eyes are different, just like mine.That small neon shape, glowing a light greenish.Practically invisible, even if you were looking for it.The imperfection they never caught in the Orphanage.It couldve been the end of me, that little squiggle.And shes got it, too.Something isnt right.Suddenly, my head is vibrating inside.Temples throb like theyll bust my head wide open.From the darkest part of my brain, a voice explodes from some memory Ive never had.When you find her, you will know who she is ...Im scared.The first time Ive ever admitted it, even to myself....simply by looking her in the eyes, she says to me.She releases me and I roll away.She looks as confused as I feel.Howd you know what I was thinking?I ask.I heard you.It was inside my head!Still, she says.The words were already on my tongue.I couldnt keep my mouth shut.Huh.I have that problem sometimes, too.Those words.They werent mine.It was some other voice....A mans voice.She nods.Yes.I heard him as well.It could be another one of her tricks, but one look in her eyes tells me Im mistaken.Shes as freaked out as I am.Who is he?I ask.We stare at each other.With only his voice, neither of us has much of an answer.For once, I wish she was talking.Have you always had that in your eye?Yes, she says, nodding.She looks like a little, frightened girl.Suddenly, I feel like one.We stare at each other.Unable to look away.A breeze lifts my hair.Hers, too.We both look up.PCF patrollers hover overhead, surrounding us.Do not move, booms some mechanical authority.You are hereby restrained on order of the Independent High Council.Failure to comply will result in the usage of force.Do not move.You are hereby restrained on order of the Independent High Council ...Oh, Cassina, I am truly going to kill you.18           Livia   I have lived here my entire life, but its only recently that soldiers have violated the sanctuary my father established.It seems they drop by every time I have an uninvited guest.I have always been told that trouble could rise from the Lower Levels and no quantity of air would be a great enough barrier without their armed support.But who are these soldiers to warn me, on my own island?My guest, uninvited or not, demands my hospitality.She growls a name, and I feel her anger is almost endless.Whos Cassina?I ask.The reason the PCF are here.She told them where to find me, I know it.That airhead set me up!Shes under the fall trees, crouched low to the earth, looking up at me with fury.Get down!Theyll see us.I peer at the fleet of patrollers circling directly above us.A bit late for that, I say.Now!I dislike her tone, her strategy even less.The trees will offer us little protection from their scanners.They knew we were here long before they arrived.Failure to comply will result in the use of force, blares the speakerfeed.It repeats itself as often as Etiquette Tutor.Theres too much open field for you to escape on foot, I say.You think youre any faster?What I think is that they have certainly not come for me.I have a craft hidden, not far that way.She points.I cant see it, so it must be farther than we could ever hope to get.The patrollers draw lower, their dual engines creating violent gusts that sway the trees around us.The leaves blow bare.Soon theyll be no cover at all.Once again, I sense this girl strongly; her vulnerability is oozing through her silitex.Shes growing increasingly frantic, realizing theres little time and too many unanswered questions.She turns to me, hair whipped into improper stylings, expression ferocious.Tell me!she yells over the mechanical roar.I need to know where Kane is!I have reached my limit of tolerance.Do all assassins come in pairs?I yell right back.We glower in a silent battle of wills.You are hereby restrained, blares the speakerfeed.I wont answer her question, I decide.Not with my blood still wet on her fist.Not with my mark hidden within her eye as well.Her body tenses.Shes going to run for it and they will gun her down.She is my guest.I must show her hospitality.This way, I tell her.For an instant, she doesnt comprehend.Then horror crosses her face.Shes used to working alone.These crafts above are only the beginning, as you well know, I say rationally.Were surrounded.As you are also aware, your chances of escaping are nil.You will be obliterated within two feet.She knows I speak the truth.I am also her only option.Unfortunately, she is mine as well.At least Ive had Governess and Marius to mold me with proper manners, no matter how resistant Ive been.Ive learned by being pushed and pushing back.She has only this Kane person.They are curious killers, the both of them.Marius will succeed in finding me a cohabitant, I know that in my heart of hearts, her charms sealing my fate.Condemning me.I see my future clearly, enslaved to this monotonous system.Death by politeness.By decree of the Independent High Council.Listen closely, I tell her, for your life depends on my every word....19           Lex   I elbow her hard in the belly.She doubles over and I grab the sword by her feet.Then I grab her by the hair and drag her with one arm, the blade against her neck.She moans.If I spill her blood, mine is next.Be careful, she says.Gotta make it realistic, I delight in saying back.The sword wont sing for me, not when it means doing her harm.Ill honor our deal.We both have freedom on our minds.Only rebels consider death freedom.I do not.We have a plan, and it makes me want to puke.I have no other option, I tell myself.There are too many PCF.And she still hasnt told me where to find Kane.I can do it without her, Im pretty sure.But knowing his location would sure make it easier.Meeting her has only given me more questions.Like the eye thing.Whats that about?If I dont take her, Ill never know.Still, something isnt right.Im a fighter.I need to stop running.But now is definitely not the time so I have to take her.I hate her even more now that its come to this.I look up toward the patrollers.Indras finest?I cant believe I bought that.One word from Cassina and they turn on their own.I go from Special Op to enemy of the Indrithian state before most people eat lunch.Surely my record would exonerate me.Surely they would see all Ive overcome.Surest of all, I know Indra is an unforgiving bitch that would kick me down to a paroled Hub scrubber.My fall was planned all along.Right now, Cassina is reclining somewhere with a pointy chinned grin.In SpecOps, you study the PCF training handbook.Then they teach you how to do everything better.Theyre hunting me right now.I count six officers in camouflage silitex in the synth scaping around us.Theyre fanning out until were flanked.I hesitate any longer and theyll have us completely surrounded.Ive got a blade to her neck.Ive got a half dozen guys who want my head decorating their holofile.This cant turn out well.But why does this airgirl have my symbol?
