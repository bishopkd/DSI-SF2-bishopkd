Very good, Livia, she said.They have all stopped looking by now, I am sure, and have been made well aware they cannot unnerve us.You may relax.Try to abstain from overtly gazing in their direction, I should say.Just for the time being.I wouldnt be able to help myself, I was sure, and didnt know in what direction to face.I chose the only safe place that came to mind.Socialization Club, I said, reading the sign above my head.Id been able to read since finding a holoreader in Fathers study.It wouldnt be until much later that I discovered the zinger there.Id never used a holoreader myself, but Id observed Governesss daily reading breaks.I often peeped over her shoulder in anticipation of the tiny men and women who popped off the screen.They wore elaborate dress and danced across the air in front of Governess.They frolicked through fields and reclined in their chambers, arms and legs entwined.Sometimes, oddly, they werent wearing clothes at all.Why are they always napping?I asked.Governess started from her chair.This is not for little girls, she responded, snapping off the holoreader, the light of these little peoples lives expiring.Now I had Fathers holoreader, and Governess would never know!I carefully inserted a cartridge and the screen lit up.This one had no people, only bursts of light racing across the air in front of me.Words.Beautiful, luminous words.I sounded them out as they skimmed the air, at first with much difficulty, then with growing ease, still not understanding their meanings, when I was interrupted with a gasp.Governess stared at me from the entrance.Her mouth dropped open.Do not move, she said.I must send word to Marius and Waslo.Now I will have a Discussion, I thought sourly, wishing Id never found the thing in the first place.Soon after, all three gathered to listen to me recite the words.Before Indra, the study of genetics was elementary at best.At their most basic level, genetics are understood to be the traits passed from parent to child.Those early researchers, with their prehistoric notions, could not comprehend our modern Indrithian science, our ability to control and perfect these basic human elements, to choose the most appealing and beneficial, therefore creating a human specimen with the most preferential makeup  Impossible, said Waslo, grabbing the holoreader from my small hands and scanning the screen furiously.He looked at Marius.Word for word, he said, full of disbelief.She is not yet four.How could she possibly  Do not forget her heritage, Marius said, smiling at me.Livia is special.We already knew that.She made special sound like a good thing.What is a human specimen with the most preferential of makeup?I asked.You are, my love, said Marius, smiling.Now, outside the Socialization Club, there was no smile.Here, I decided, being special was not a good thing.Between the rules and Mariuss playacting and the frightening ride from Helix, I wished I hadnt come in the first place.Perhaps she saw my apprehension.Instantly, Mariuss old self returned.She leaned over, face very close to mine, eyes wide and voice very low.Livia, I need you to promise me something.I nodded.You might be asked to do strange things here.Things you do not always enjoy.But you must not complain or refuse.You must promise to do all that is required, no matter the difficulty, and behave as though every task is simple and pleasing.Above all, my love, you must be a very sweet, good girl, even when you do not feel that way.Do you trust me?I nodded.Of course I trusted Marius.Then you must promise to try.Will you?For me?Yes, I said fiercely.I sensed her wanting to reach out and pull me into her embrace.Please, I thought, imagining the comfort of her warmth.Instead, she stood abruptly, the Escort character returning.You will be fine, she said, giving me a tiny nod.Now you must go inside.Inside, I sat in a circle of girls wearing identical dresses, the only variation being the pastel shade.We sat silently, eyes downcast, and I wondered how I would keep my promise to Marius when I felt like asking, Why is no one speaking?All I really wanted was to run home to Helixnot considering that running was not an option between islandstake off these pinching layers, climb on Veda, and gallop across Tranquillity Pastures fast as I could.Welcome, Little Girls of Upper Indra, to your first Socialization Club.As though materializing from empty air, a woman stood at the center of the circle.I had never seen anyone so tall, her body seeming to have been stretched upward.Her face was blank and unreadable, cheekbones high and sharp as blades.I am Etiquette Tutor, she said.And that is the only title by which I will be addressed.The floor beneath her began rising.Once the circular platform was a few feet above us, it began a painfully slow rotation, allowing just enough time for this towering woman to stare at each girl until she was visibly discomforted.In that instant, Etiquette Tutor said the girls name and moved on to the next.Emilia Johnsian, she said.Rotate.Stare.Tirithia Lysander.Rotate.Stare.On and on, for what felt like hours.I knew an hour, for this was the time I was forced to lie across my sleeper each day for what Governess referred to as Rejuvenation.An hour was a very long time, and this felt like several of those.Margarite Fredrickus.Rotate.Stare.Cybele Manius.Rotate.Stare.Etiquette Tutor had skin smooth as ours, yet pulled tightly across her face, her eyes seeming to protrude, her stare all the more intimidating.Somehow, I knew she was very old, even more so than Governess.I tried not to stare at her, not knowing where else to focus.I fought the urge to fidget in my chair, to twist my frock ties around my fingers, to fill my cheeks with air and tap my fingers.There were so many things I could not be doing that, in that moment, they were what I desired to do more than anything else.I looked at my feet and thought about not wiggling them.I contemplated the possibility of merely wiggling my toes.This would be acceptable, I reasoned, for she could not see through shoes.How does she know our names?She will not know my name, I thought, wiggling first the left toes and then the right.For she has never met me....And you ...The words were not loud, yet felt that way.I snapped upright as they reverberated through my body.I looked left and right for the source.Then I remembered.Slowly, I lifted my chin upward.Her gaze was penetrating, the prominent eyes giving me the distinct feeling I had no skin on my body.She did not flinch, nor did her focus shift.After a very long timeit felt like ten Rejuvenation naps, at leastshe opened her pinched lips....are Livia Cosmo.At my name, all the girls looked up from their own toes.What is your name?Claudia Quintias, said the girl in pale violet.I cannot hear you.Claudia Quintias, she said, a tiny bit louder.Too loud.A Proper Little Girl of Indra must be heard, yet never offend the ear.Try again.Claudias knees shook.Etiquette Tutor moved in steady revolutions around the circle, as though we were locked in a cage and she our keeper.She moved with grace, appearing to float across the floor.I had the unnerving feeling that, at any moment, she might creep up and shock us with a stunner.In reality, her words were more effective than that.One by one, each girl mounted the platform for interrogation.Why are you standing like that, Nadine?Your knees turned together, back hunched over.Unattractive, to say the very least.A Proper Little Girl stands tall.Is that tall?Now you appear all the more repugnant.We have our work cut out for us, I daresay.With some girls, this went on for a very long time.For others, the session ended as quickly as it had begun.What is your least favorite food, Daphne?Eggplant stew.I see.Your hair is a catastrophe.You may sit.Immediately following, the dazed subject stumbled off the platform, stifling tears.No one wanted to repeat Cybeles unfortunate mistake.Crying is not only inappropriate but entirely unattractive.If you could see yourself, Cybele, you would be as offended as I am.Red faced and sniveling.And you already will have to try much harder than the other girls, for you do not have the asset of being pleasing to the eye.Are you deaf as well as unappealing?Stop that abhorrent tearful display immediately.I forced myself to sit still.Be good, I told myself, even though the pinched places on my skin were now raw, the tightly wound ribbons leaving my arms and legs numb and tingling.Even more, I needed to relieve myself.I knew I must stifle the urge, though, or be accused of vulgarity for asking to be excused.You must be very sweet, good girl, I reminded myself, even when you do not feel that way.Ah.The Cosmo Airess herself.I do not know that word, I told her, standing as straight as I could.Admitting to ineptitude devalues your appeal.You must never admit to ignorance.The same is true of displaying excessive knowledge, which Proper Young Men find even less appealing.When you do not know a word, you mustnt let anyone know.So, once again.Are you, in fact, the Cosmo Airess?I nodded firmly.Do not bob your head like a ruffian.She demonstrated a slight, girlish nod.It is not that difficult, Livia.This is not Genetic Engineering.I nodded in my slightest, most girlish manner.You should not show agreement when there has not been a question.We are not off to a promising start, are we, Livia Cosmo?Slight, girlish nod.That was a rhetorical question.You are not meant to answer those.Do you understand?Now I was confused.Should I nod or not?Well?she said.Is that a rhetorical question as well?Are you an imbecile?This one, I could tell, was not meant to be answered.Besides, I did not know that word either.Perhaps you are.Odd, considering the genius of your father.I was confused.How did she know Father?I opened my mouth to ask, then remembered the little girl in yellow who had displayed excessive curiosity.Within moments, Etiquette Tutor had reduced her to a sniveling mess.I heard Waslo in my head telling me to be alert.I forced myself to look Etiquette Tutor directly in her bulbous eyes.Now she would know I was listening.Stop staring, Livia.Your rudeness is becoming unbearable.Once again: Are you an imbecile?I ...cannot answer.And why would that be?I do not know what imbecile is or does, so I will be incorrect either way.If I ask for a definition, I will be admitting to ineptitude.If I give you an answer, I will be displaying an overly curious nature.Or perhaps, I say, proud of myself, that was simply a rhetorical question.I was delighted with my performance.See, Marius?Now she knows I am a good girl, the kind who listens!Etiquette Tutor went silent.Since the beginning, I had found her as difficult to sense as Waslo.But in that moment, I felt a tiny fissure in her tightly sealed emotions.Etiquette Tutor didnt understand me, and she found that profoundly disturbing.Mariuss voice echoed in my head: You must act as though each task is simple and pleasing.I lifted my chin, looked Etiquette Tutor in the eyes, and smiled.Just like that, the fissure cracked wide open.I had never felt someone so strongly.Etiquette Tutor hated me.I think she had before she even met me.You, Livia Cosmo, are far less clever than you believe yourself to be, she said with an almost imperceptible quiver.You will be a trial, but I will succeed.In due time, I will wipe that knowing expression off your pretty little face, drain the precocious, uncivilized brat right out of you.I will make you a Proper Little Girl.Not an easy task, by and by, but let me be clear: I never fail.There was a long pause in which my body, damp with perspiration under the many stiff layers, went icy.Now, you may sit.Before the lesson ended, we were instructed to have a Pleasant Interaction.This is a time to engage your fellow trainees in cordial conversation, Etiquette Tutor explained.You must learn to entertain and enliven a room under any given scenario.Begin.We stared at each other, looking shell shocked and worn, our bodies seeming to droop despite our efforts to stand up straight.Now!barked Etiquette Tutor.Everyone scattered, childlike voices rising before even finding a partner.I scanned the room, but no one would meet my eyes.Everyone had gathered in tiny groups already, voices overlapping and strained.Indeed, how lovely!You do not say!How entirely delightful.Absolutely charming, I agree.I had never met children, but couldnt imagine that they all spoke like Waslo.I stood there, both invisible and on display.Surrounded by more people than ever before, yet feeling utterly alone.Hello.I was startled to see a girl smiling at me.I knew her immediately: the sole trainee Etiquette Tutor hadnt chosen to demolish, dismissing her without insult after a few simple questions.The girl had glided back to her chair and sat gracefully, her lovely face calm.She was also the girl I first saw outside, smiling faintly in the center of an adoring circle.Now the smile was aimed at me.You are Livia Cosmo, she said.And I heard you have the most glorious estate in all of Indra!Yet no one has seen it in years, I have heard ...how very delicious!Oh, you must tell me all about, well ...absolutely everything!Suddenly, her demeanor changed.She appeared devastated.Oh, how could I?Livia, you must excuse my dreadful manners!She stretched out her hand and waited.After a moment, I understood what she wanted, for me to take her tiny grip in my own.We shook hands.I am Mica, she said.And it is terribly lovely to make your acquaintance.Once Mica had taken me under her wing, the others quickly followed.I was bestowed admittance into her exclusive circle, allowing me to gaze upon her adoringly, often during Pleasant Interaction, an exercise that grew far less pleasant with each passing day.Communication among your peers is of the utmost importance, Etiquette Tutor reminded us.Begin.Within moments, Micas admirers gathered, standing elbow to elbow.Make room for Livia, she said, and thats all it took.On occasion, I was even invited to the most prime location, twining Micas arm in mine.Livia is strikingly pretty, is she not?she said to the others.Yes, they would echo with carefully monitored enthusiasm.Pretty, I soon learned, was of the utmost value, and Mica surrounded herself with what she found valuable.The most winsome of us all, of course, was Mica herself.On this we all agreed.Yes, and hasnt she the loveliest bloom upon her cheeks?Mica said, then placed her attentions elsewhere.Micas questions were all rhetorical.For the first few sessions, I didnt understand what was expected of me.I made the mistake of laughing too loudly at an amusing anecdote, to which Mica gazed off in embarrassment.On another occasion, I stated an opinion contrary to hers, the circle collapsing into deadly silence until she raised a new topic to discuss.I learned from the error of my ways, deciding it best to speak as infrequently as possible.I mimicked the others, laughing with their laughter, raising my eyebrows in disbelief the moment one of theirs had lifted.I leaned in close to hear a secret, put my hand to my mouth in shock at their startling revelations.Fitting in, I realized, was easy.Do as the others do.Act as though you share a brain.In no time at all, I knew what was expected of me; ultimately, it boiled down to a single requirement.Requirement: you must listen to Micas opinion on various topics and express complete, unwavering agreement.Topic One: Garment Selection and Physical Maintenance  Purple is far more fetching than blue.Curls are more fetching than braids, unless the braids are twisted in a certain manner, and few can achieve the intricacies of this correctly.Best to let your curls fall loosely and be easily admired.Unless you are Cybele, of course, who has been bequeathed locks of an unfortunate disposition.Poor dear.A Proper Little Girl of Indra has seven dresses at the very least, one being a shade of purple, preferably lilac.If she has made the grave mistake of partaking in yellow, the garment should be disposed of immediately, yellow being fit for only the low level Middler.I do not mean you, of course, Claudia.Your dress is lovely.And perfectly suited to your rather unique complexion.Topic Two: The Superiority of Your Family Estate  Our sitting room was just installed with the latest in live animatics, seasonal projections!Yesterday we had the most glorious sunset, and tomorrow there will be rain!My father says it happened often before the Great Catastrophe.Topic Three: The Male Species and What They Prefer  All things Mica, obviously.Topic Four: The Other Young Girls of Indra  That oneand then Mica would point at her chosengave me a rather unwelcoming look yesterday.I wouldnt do such a thing if my nose was an absolute monstrosity.Her family, I hear, is completely devoid of class and manners.A stain upon the Indrithian sky, according to Governess.Needless to say, I find her presence rather unsavory.To each and every one, I forced an expression of fascination, as did the others, taking little notice of said Chosen Girl, despite her close proximity.More often than not, Chosen Girl appeared devastated.I am nothing like them, I wanted to explain, though we would both know that to be untrue.I was just like them because of my silence.More often than not, Chosen Girl would be fighting back tears.To which Mica would inevitably say, She is just making herself look more ridiculous.I despised Mica.Even more, I despised the topics.Above all, I despised myself for following the requirement.I told myself I had no other options.Follow Mica or risk the danger of being one of her Chosen Girls, and that was a fate I feared not surviving.I was barely surviving already.And in truth, I had already been chosen.Etiquette Tutor had seen to that.4           The Academy   Lex   On my twelfth birthday, Recruiter entered the dorm after uniform inspection.I hadnt seen him since the year beforehis appearance was the only way I could track the passage of yearsand it wasnt an emotional reunion.His outfit that day was the same blue as his work uniform, but with a higher collar, and his brown boots were shined to perfection.The badge on his armband now had a second star.My contempt for his straight faced militancy had grown easier to conceal.But today his arrogance lightened his step and a smile almost broke his lips.He looked at me and shook his head as if he couldnt believe I had made it this far.Approved, he said to himself.I followed him without asking questions.Answers were hard to come by and Id given up playing that game long ago.Since the moment I saw Samanthas empty cot.I treated everyone around me exactly how I felt about them: like they didnt exist.It wasnt hard to do.They knew how wild I could get with my fists.They kept their distance.Everyone here already had so little, they couldnt afford to lose their teeth.I figured the change in Recruiters disposition was because he was getting rid of me.Today was my graduation from the Orphanage, if you could call it that.And I was going somewhere, though I wasnt sure where.Most went to the Hub, and the stories of the orphans that went there were passed along the cots before lights out.A lifetime spent in ration assembly lines and sanitation facilities, only to return to a cramped Hubber barracks with the rest of the unseen and forgotten.Who were deemed uncohabitable and functionally useless.And those were the freaks who hadnt even hit Rock Bottom.I couldnt keep track of those who bottomed out, there have been too many.Still, I knew I was headed for something different.I wasnt sure what, but I felt pretty certain change was coming.And that part was kind of exciting.As we neared the last security gate before the Orphanages outer walls, Recruiter said, Youll thank me one day, Lexie.Lex, I said.Hows my memory better than yours?Your holofile reports your identity  I dont care what my holofile says!And Ill never thank you.For anything.He raised his eyebrows but didnt respond.For some reason, this weak, desperate man was no better than any of us.He needed me!His quality of life depended on just one of us paying off.Guess thats why he overlooked the fact that I was unpredictable and obviously hated his breathing guts.Secretly, I was as proud as he was.But Id never let him see that.An all terrain transporter idled outside the gate.Recruiter flashed the driver his badge, then opened the back door for me.Didnt you want to say good bye to anyone?he said mockingly.I boarded without looking back.Then we were traveling, the transporter rumbling beyond the Orphanage walls, and I got a rush, a taste of freedom looking back on my former home.The Orphanage was bright.Flooded by luminators so strong my skin glowed yellow.But beyond the lights there was almost nothing.Was the world really this dark?My eyes hurt for a moment as they adjusted to the darkness.Only the beamers of our transporter lit our path.Ahead patrol tower spotlights became beacons that kept us on track, the towers themselves isolated and rising through the murky black.Men in bright orange uniforms appeared through the fog, blasters slung over their shoulders, keeping watch on us through their goggles until we were no longer visible to each other.Occasionally another transporter bounced along the rocky surface beside us, beamers cutting through black, and we would swerve to avoid it.I had a million questions.Not that Id give Recruiter the satisfaction.Approved!he kept saying, then mumbling about promotions and honors and chuckling to himself.The darkness seemed to go forever in the tunnels.It seemed impossible that anyone could have constructed this network.Then there was light.Faint.Coming closer.Then blazing.A huge gate, sizzling with electricity.A sign: PCF ACADEMY.Underneath the sign: Be Industrious.Be Vigilant.Behave.Before I could even register the words, I was inside.Recruiter dropped me off at the gate, his smile even greater than before.Here I was, dropped at another set of huge doors, and this monstrosity wouldve dwarfed ten Orphanages.We parted without further words.Just like with the transfer processing at the Orphanage, they gave me a uniform.Unlike before, this one fit perfectly.They gave me new shoes.Real ones instead of pass me down slippers.They gave me a cadet badge.They gave me a sleeper pod.They gave me Cassina right next door.Well, you cant get everything.Im not sure just why Im here.Cadets are hand chosen, the best of the best.Maybe Im the best of the worst.To be a cadet, you just need to be born that way.It doesnt matter where you come from.You can be the offspring of Islanders, your childhood spent floating in the air like some Airess, or you could be some Middlers child.Its not likely, but even a spawn of the lowliest Hub worker might be selected.What you have in common, the senior lieutenant says at our initiation, is that you are the most promising youth Indrithian Society has to offer.Middlers, Hubbies, Islanders: they all look proud.No one like me.Im the only one of my kind.Cassina is from the Upper Levels.She grew up on her own island.Even at twelve, I knew Cassinas goal: to get me kicked out of the Academy.Id been assigned pod 13, right next to hers.Great!shed said, her voice echoing through the cadet quarters.They put me next to the dirt squirt!Whatd you say?I was standing over my sleeper, for the first time having one my size.Youre gonna make my pod reek, she said, moving closer.Her thin, venomous lips were pulled into white lines, her nostrils flaring.You stink like mud, girl.You subbies cant ever wash away that stank.So I punched her.Right across that pointy little chin.Her jaw slammed shut on her tongue and blood fell over her lip.She stumbled back against her sleeper, embarrassment rushing to her cheeks.Not so tough now, I thought, watching her stumble up to her sleeper, shock turning to hatred.She glared up at me.Youll pay ...orphan.I lunged for her, but someone pulled me back before I could do more damage.Welcome to the Academy, I thought as the pod captain led me to her office for my first disciplinary meeting of many.Not a promising start, Cadet, shed said, staring at me from behind the shiny metallic desk.She wasnt old, but life belowground had drained her youth, and the blond hair sticking out from beneath her cap was brittle and dry.I will never be like her, I thought.The rage still bubbled within me, my knees shaking.I know you come from a unique situation, Cadet Lexie.Lex, I said.She ignored me.The first recruit via the Orphanage.Unprecedented situation, yes, but let me make this clear: here you are just a cadet.You are just like everyone else.It was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to me.However, we both knew it was a lie.We have rules, she said, expressionless.We have procedure.A way of doing things.You are a cadet now, and you have to play by Academy rules.If you plan on staying, that is.I tried to look like I wasnt still thinking about doing Cassina serious harm.Mudgirl.Subbies.Dirt.Thats what you called someone who wasnt even a person.I tried to look remorseful.Inside, I didnt feel sorry.Not one bit.Is that understood?Captain said, slow and loud like I didnt speak her language.Like I wasnt smart enough to understand.She thinks Im a mudgirl, too.They all do.Absolutely, I said, with more than a little disdain in my voice.She raised her eyebrows.I looked her dead on.Yes, Captain, I understand and appreciate the concise yet thorough clarification regarding this issue.See?I use a lot of words and say absolutely nothing.Just like you.She stared at me for a moment.Maybe you need more time to contemplate the seriousness of this offense.I got Pod Confinement for the rest of the evening.I spent those long hours pacing the tiny circular unit.Part of me was thrilled.My own room!With a desk for my studies, a sleeper twice as big as my Orphanage one hovering in the corner.My own pod, all for my belongings.Not that I owned anything, but it was still pretty strato.Then again, Id already made an enemy.In less than a day.Id hurt her, but that didnt change her mind any.That look in Cassinas eyes, the one that made my fist fly without thinking, promised she wouldnt quit.And if I punched her again, theyd bottom me out of the Academy before I wiped the blood off my knuckles.Next stop: the Hub, where theyd bury me in the lowest of the low jobs.I kicked the wall.No way Ill spend the rest of my life scrubbing at Hubber waste.Not cause of some spoiled Upper Level synth priss.Not some brain damaged air sucker.Ill prove her wrong, I thought, practically bouncing off the metal walls.Ill prove them all wrong.Ill be stronger, smarter.Ill be the best cadet the Academy ever saw.No one will remember I came from the Orphanage.I knew that last part was a lie.Sounded good, though.I dont need anyone.I never will.But that part I still believed.Lived by.A promise Id made myself long ago.Of course, that was before I met Kane.Id been so hardheaded in proving that I wasnt some dirt eater in my first week that I wasnt prepared for someone like Kane.Taking laps around the rec grounds, pushing myself even during break time, I saw him out of the corner of my eye, running up on me from behind.I wheeled around on him, and in seeing my raised fists, he put his hands in front of his face.Easy, Cadet!When I lowered them, he was grinning, his lip curled up in the way that I realize now is his thing.I felt my face relax.Kane, already beautiful at twelve, even when the rest of us were growing into our awkward bodies.Only a week in and the girls followed him in a giggling pack, fighting to sit next to him at lunch, offering him bites of their rations.Drooling over a guy?Absurd.But giving away food?Completely insane.Thats not what we were here for.Cassina needed to save her rations for herself.Shed never seen an orphan wither away to nothing.I hated her face already, but her pointed features became more intolerable the more lovesick she got.But Kane was never rude to her or anyone else, his patience seemingly unexhausted by her babble or adoring smiles.The one thing about not needing anyone: you spend a lot of time watching the very people you dont need.And I could spot disinterest.Twitches.Eye rolls.Someone chewing the inside of their cheek.I watched Cassina and Kane talk and his eyes would look right through her.In his head, hed gone somewhere else.I knew that place well.I went there as often as I could.Sure, his approaching me couldve been a setup.But he wasnt much bigger than me.I could take him if I had to, and honestly, it might do a few things for my rep.Cmere, he said.I followed him down the path as Cassina slaughtered me from afar with jealous whispers.That made me smile.I didnt let him see, of course.We came into a clearing and he led me toward the storage units that held the Academys supplies.Everyone knew they were off limits and alarmed.You can break the rules all you want, tough guy, but dont involve me.Tough guy?He grinned at me.All thats in there is used zip ball equipment.You got to look behind it to get to the good stuff.He disappeared into a narrow passage between the units.Of course, intrigued, I followed.I squeezed through the containers and found myself moving underground.The trail led downward into a pitch black passageway.What smells?I asked.Waste disposal facility, said Kane.You take all the girls here?I muttered.But the truth?I was impressed that Kane had discovered his own personal sanctuary under all this surveillance.That hed found someplace he could call his own.Since the Academy was located so far below the crustbeneath even the Hubthe only lights were artificial, just like at the Orphanage.And they were everywhere, a sodium yellow hue constantly broadcasting across our skin.Lights are a luxury in the lower regions.Light means you matter.They say Rock Bottom is pitch black.Kane stared at me.Even in the black, I could make out his face.This sensory thing that I hide from everyone.I can see pretty well in the dark, freakishly well.And my hearings not bad either.Freakishly not bad.But these things are best kept to myself.There are parts of yourself that are better off hidden.He switched on his beamer, his face hovering just inches from mine.Hes just a regular person, Kane.He grinned at me in his spotlight.Laugh, he said, pulling something from his jacket.Why?Trust me, just laugh.You can laugh, cant you?I guess, I said.I didnt do it that often, that was for sure.But there isnt anything ...to laugh at.He nodded.Wanna see my impression of Cassina?Not really.He did it anyway.Sucked in his cheeks, pushed out his chin, gave me her sharp, love struck stare.Like an infatuated Hubber with serious mental issues.People said Cassina was beautiful.Her friends said it a lot.Apparently, the guys thought so, too.The whole thing was strange.Like a mass delusion.Cassina is beautiful, someone says.And everyone believes it.I saw her ugliness from the very beginning.The cruelness in her cells.Could that be transmitted through her genetics?Perhaps I wanted to believe this, to confirm that my parents were stronger people, which bore out in my nature.It also probably meant theyd passed along their anger as well.Kanes impression made me laugh.Not because it was that funny, but because it was the first time Id felt it was even okay to do so since getting to the Academy.This weird kidKanemade me feel okay.As I laughed he pointed a device in my direction that suddenly made a sharp sucking sound, all so quick I almost missed it.Got it, he said.Got what?The pattern.Of your laugh.He pointed his beamer and sprayed the wall in front of us with the other device, and I watched the explosion of light and color hit the air.Purples and blues crashing into each other, dripping down in vibrant streaks before they hit the ground and flowed into the floor grates.The surprise took my breath away.That almost never happened either.I dont do surprise.Sound painting, he said, smiling.Thats what your laugh looks like.He looked a little surprised himself.Ive never seen those colors before.Not for a laugh.Stop looking at me, I said.Youre looking at me, he said.I turned away, kicked at the ground.Besides, you must be used to it.If you havent noticed, everyone looks at you.We just cant help it.Of course I noticed.Maybe because youre pretty, he said.Pretty?Id been called lots of things, but never that.Shut your mouth.Well, it could be that, but maybe its something else.I almost lost my words for a second.What?Your horns.Horns?Orphans have horns, dont they?You all hide them under your hair.He was smiling.Then I noticed I was, too.I wish, I said.That would be cool.I know, he said.We were quiet for a second.Thinking about our horns, probably.Mine would be really sharp.Cassina wouldnt dare be on the other end of a head butt.I liked your ...color thingy, I said finally.I motioned where the colors had been.Howd you do all that?Practice, he said.My brush transfers the sound waves into pure aerosol pigment.You control what comes out by being very selective of what you take in.Ive been doing them since I was a kid.It occurred to me he was still a kid, and so was I.   Im not supposed to do it here.No paints or personal items.I think theyre all worried well get personalities.Youd get into more trouble with one of those.Then why did you show me?I just thought youd like it.I dont know.I thought youd create something beautiful.I guess ...I wanted to talk to you.Dont you know Im dangerous?Havent you heard?Core low mudgirl, all that?Yeah, he said.I think thats pretty strato, to tell you the truth.That you arent like everyone else.We stared at each other.He looked normal, but this kid was weird.Even weirder than me maybe.I kind of liked him.I wont tell anyone, I said.If you promise one thing.What?Promise me youll do it again.For a second, we were quiet.We just smiled at each other.Just wait, he said, till I paint your scream.I couldnt help sticking out.And it wasnt just because Cassina hated me.The second classes started, it was obvious I didnt know anything.Our first week, the cadet instructor showed us holo images in the Great Indra: Geography of Fulfillment.We walked around the 3 D projection of the City of Indra.Not the Lower Levels, but everything aboveground.The buildings rising into the sky.The clouds and floating islands above that.The others looked bored.Theyd seen it before.But I moved in close, trying to make out the tiniest details.Id never imagined anything like this.The most you could dream of in the Orphanage was the Hub.The Islands looked like a make believe, like the one wed visited in the Orphanage Archive, The Girl Tied with Rope.Our one access chip, given as charity from the Independent High Council.We all had Archive slots on our wrists, of course.Even if you didnt arrive to the Orphanage with one, they fixed that.If they were going to keep you, that is.You had to at least make it to Infant Surveillance.Kane doesnt remember his Archive slot insertion.No one I know does, he told me.I think they put you to sleep first.Lucky you, I said.I knew he wanted to ask questions, but he didnt.I rarely talked about the Orphanage.And somehow, he knew not to ask.Of course, I have a great memory.That isnt always a good thing.They strapped down my little wrists, so I kicked.In the end, they had to bring in three caretakers to hold me down.I saw Infant Supervisor lift a sharp, silver instrument.It let off a few sparks, which scared me even more.I think he wanted me to see that.He lowered the instrument.Not seeing was even worse.Then there was a hiss.I screamed so loud they had to cover my mouth.It might not have been the worst pain in the world, but thats how I remember it.The slots are nearly invisible.Just a faint mark across your wrist.We all used The Girl Tied with Rope.You just tap your wrist and then press your thumb there.After that, the access chip slides right in.Other than that one make believe, we really had no use for the wrist slots.If we made it out of the Orphanage one day, we would visit other Archives.If being the key word.But we all loved it.Loved it so much the Archive was pretty beaten up.The orphans visited so many times that wed trampled a path though the untouched forest.The leaves wilted, the branches drooped.Even the princesstied to a tree, waiting for the prince to rescue her from outlawslooked annoyed.Wed ignored her for so long that over the years, her cries for help sounded bored.Besides, Id always been more interested in the shadowy man with the black cloak.Sometimes Id turn, and there he was, slipping through the forest.I didnt care about the princess.I wanted to run after him.But before I had a chance, hed disappear.Help!the princess would shout.Then shed sigh and roll her eyes.A shadow person.I didnt know what that was until the Academy.Shadow people are living human beings like us, Instructor told us.But they have committed great crimes against Indra.These dark figures, she explained, are forced to wander the Archives, unable to interact.Voiceless and directionless, destined to live the same scenario over and over.The worse the crime, the more awful their Archive prison.I imagined my entire lifetime spent trapped in the same location.The middle of the desert or a freezing dungeon.The Orphanage.It was horrible.The only perk, I figured, would be no Cassina.The shadow people, the instructor said, serve as living reminders to the rest of us.Indras greatness is to be appreciated through our loyalty.We must follow rules and be proper citizens.My head spun.They cant be real!I said before I could stop the words from coming.Cassina giggled.Her friends followed suit.How dumb is she?she whispered.Of course theyre real, said Instructor.Then where are their bodies?Excuse me?If theyre in the Archives, where are their bodies?How do they eat?How many are there?Are they aware theyre being punished.My mind spiraled away from me, my mouth moving faster than my brain.I mean, how big is Indra?Does it have that many enemies?I looked around.No one was laughing anymore.Just staring at me like I was crazy.All you need to know is right in front of you.She pointed with a sharp fingernail at the 3 D image.The City of Indra.She pointed higher.The Islands.She didnt know any of the answers herself.I could tell.The others looked annoyed at my silly questions.They already knew about the City of Indra.Theyd been there, and many had grown up on the Islands.But here they were, accepting all that was recited before them, not questioning how long it would take to travel by ground transporter around the outer borders, or what laid outside of them.But if you were to, say, take advantage of the Governmental Educational Archives after class, which are completely unrestricted, and referenced the reports of the Independent High Council, you could learn what you werent being taught.For example:  Indras greatness makes travel beyond unnecessary.Even more, the repercussions would be enormous.Certain death would occur upon encountering the edges, if not before.Indra provides more than enough resources to serve as a self sustaining biosphere.It is far larger than the major metropolitan hubs of former earth and estimated to be the size of the East Coast of former America (see appendix 34A for historic maps).The great Indra was built from the barren, scorched earth of the old world.A world so flawed in nature that it failed.Our ancestors learned from former earths shortcomings and built Indra to be much stronger and more resilient than the cities of the past.The City of Indra is a centerpiece to the sophisticated modern age.The City of Indra is The City.Id looked at the map.The East Coast of former America?That was enormous.And Instructor said none of it mattered.Except the City of Indra, that is.And the Lower Levels right below, where we stood now.Terraforming the rotted former world into the great Indra had taken a thousand years.The founders of Indra had once sought safety below the earth, then built upward in search of water.Just creating the foundations of the City of Indra took centuries.At least, thats what Instructor told us.As to the mechanics of how they did that, she offered no explanation.I held my tongue in class and resolved to find answers to my own questions outside of it.When they were young, my classmates learned Indras history from The Book of Indra.There was no book of anything in the Orphanage.What knowledge of Indra would be useful to them in Rock Bottom?Would dreams of a better life only lead to more heartbreak and disappointment?The Indrithians had risen above Rock Bottom.Theyd built day and nightboth marked by never ending darknessfor hundreds of years, reaching upward, and pulled themselves from beneath the earth and into daylight.Leaving the unworthy and unaccomplished behind to fester in the chaos of Rock Bottom below, forever jealous of the glimpse of star shine theyd seen miles above, before that world was sealed off once more.Id never been aboveground, but I would make it, just like the founders of Indra.I knew nothing back then.During The Book of Indra: Worship and Recitation, everyone brought their own copies of The Book.No personal items had one exception, I guess.The girls passed theirs around, comparing.Yours is so stratosphere, said one of Cassinas followers to another.Ive never seen so many dried leaves.Are they real?Those were real leaves on her book, not synth leaves.They were remnants of a time before the Great Catastrophe.Very little real nature existed, and only the most powerful Indrithians owned a piece.Having one leaf was a big deal.Covering The Book of Indra in them?I never imagined such riches.Butterfly wings, said another, holding hers out for all to see.Feathers, said another.That one looked soft.Everyone went ooh and ahh, but I knew they were just waiting for the chance to show off their own.Pollen.Petals.Beetles.It used to be alive!squealed the owner.I mean, it actually walked around!Someone cleared their throat.Faces turned.The room went quiet.Cassina held up her copy nonchalantly.Hers was shiny, with complicated patterns swirling into each other.Reptilian, she said smugly.Snakeskin.Only one in all of Indra.Im not sure if anyone else knew what a snake was, but they all looked impressed.You could observe an Archive full of snakes and immediately see how well Cassina belonged to their world.What about Lexs copy?said Cassina.Everyone turned to stare at me.I shrugged.You dont even have The Book of Indra?she said.If you dont have one, how do you prove your existence?I mean, like, even Hubbies have them!She shot a look at three kids in the back of the class who never strayed far from one another, as misplaced as me, but at least they had standard issue copies.Even if I had one of those, Id probably be dismissed because the pages werent real paper like those of the Islanders, instead of rice paper or some other substitute.Just be glad youre in the Academy, Lex, or you wouldnt have clothes either.Everyone laughed.Even the Hubbies!Who had never been aboveground or seen the City of Indra either!That didnt keep them from laughing.Two of them, at least.Not the tiny one with shiny black hair.Howd she even get in the Academy?Id heard people say.Shes so little she can hardly see a target.Her name was Vipsinia.Vippy for short.She was always staring at me.Watching me blast targets, following the route I took to class.Popping up when I least expected her.She just thinks youre cool, Kane said.Or shes gonna smother me in my sleep, I said.Vippy just lifted her own plain copy defiantly, flipped the pages.Held it in front of her like it was made of gold and glared defiantly at Cassina over the top.Gutsy for someone you could snap in half.What really mattered was that Hubber Vippy had her own book, and I had zip.The Book of Indra, Kane explained later, is made of real materials.No holo anything.Real words on real paper.The Book of Indra, as the instructor put it, contains the words by which we aspire to live.In the Orphanage, our only aspiration was to make it to twelve.Vippy flipped a page forcefully.Everyone else stared at me like I had ration gravy on my face.Hey, Lex!said a voice.You can share mine.Kane.Rescuing me.No one would laugh at Kane.Cassina just stared at him, the mean melting off her pointy face.Then she looked at me.From dreamy eyed to death stare.I moved next to him.Thanks, I mumbled.Whatever, he said.It wasnt for you.I just dont wanna get crap about my book.I knew he was lying.Kane didnt care what anyone thought.Scrubber wimp, I said.He grinned, knowing I didnt mean it.For a second, I wanted to hold his hand.Reach under the desk and squeeze it.That was the first time I ever wanted to touch someone.We both looked at his book.There were no strange patterns.No feathers or leaves or skins.Just colors, swirling into each other.Colors Id never seen before or even imagined.I did it myself, he said.Its the sound of my breathing.5           Countdown to Emergence Ball: 6 Years   Livia   When Etiquette Tutor demanded to know the foods we found most reprehensible, I told the truth.In retrospect, I should not have been so honest.Etiquette Tutor watched as I lifted the spoon to my mouth, a blob of slimy kidney meat quivering before me.Leisure Skills, according to Etiquette Tutor, are our birthright and duty as females.A Proper Little Girl of Indra must be adept in showing delight, even while enduring the most disagreeable of experiences.The others whispered excitedly upon first seeing the dining table, cooing over the candelabra and polished silverware, giddily pointing out the delicate roses engraved on the fine china.We sat completely straight, as instructed, and daintily unfolded the linens edged in fine lace and placed them on our laps.I knew this would not end well.The key to expressing delight is simple: you must always maintain a smile.I heard the gasps before I even lifted the domed lid of my serving tray.Claudia took Etiquette Tutors words to heart.Within moments, she retched violently through a smile.My spoon was poised yet unmoving, the shiny lump gleaming in the candlelight.My hand appeared to be frozen.Now, Livia, I told myself.Just open your mouth.These dishes are not made from real animals.Real animals had been extinct for centuries, except for Veda.This meat was synthesized by bioengineers in sky labs.The vegetables were grown in the Aero Crown, perched in the atmosphere even higher than the Islands.In the City of Indra, the food was more functional: protein cubes, dehydrated vegetables, powdered vitamin supplements.Here, we were given re creations of former earths delicacies.Eating such fine replications was considered an honor.I didnt care to be honored.I just cared to be excused.When Etiquette Tutor asked our least favorite food, the majority of us were quick to please, each naming a dish more horrendous than the last.Staring down at the kidney, I believed myself to have been most successful.Consume the kidney, Livia, said Etiquette Tutor, and I knew there would be no more stalling.I closed my eyes and, for barely an instant, brought forth Mariuss voice in my head.I often did this during etiquette lessons that caused me distress, meaning nearly every single one.You must be a very sweet, good girl.Even when you do not feel that way.I shoved the blob into my mouth.Not so fast.You must appear to savor your meal.And your smile must be believed.I took another bite, this time slower.The glutinous kidney was cold on my tongue, and its bitter juice pooled at the back of my throat.Smile, barked Etiquette Tutor.Do not vomit.I forced a swallow, my lips pulled upward.Across from me, Mica took dainty bites of her banana souffl.She simply hated dessert.It was so fattening and sugary.Etiquette Tutor watched me swallow, shook her head, and nodded to my plate.Again, Livia.Your countenance should say, This kidney is divine.More kidney.More kidney.Bite after bite, smiling till the corners of my lips ached.And yet, Etiquette Tutor deemed my performance unsatisfactory, even more so than that of Bettina, who, after vomiting pig trotters across the floor, was simply told to wipe up and begin with a fresh pair of feet.Perhaps, Livia, you have never experienced delight.Or even an emotion that would lead you to keep your mouth closed when you chew, for I do not care to see what you are digesting.I finished the kidney, worried that I would now be forced to lick the plate clean as well.I gulped down a glass of water and took a deep breath and gave my first real smile.It was worth every horrendous momentMicas requirement, kidney, Etiquette Tutorfor Mariuss support.Today we learned Reliance on Others to Affirm Our Femininity, I told her.And Etiquette Tutor had us affect the state of one who has become incapacitated due to physical injury and must remain fetching while awaiting a Proper Young Gentleman to rescue her.In actuality, I was fully aware I could rescue myself, though had long ago given up questioning the need for our lessons.Need, I had come to realize, was beside the point.Ah, yes.Indeed, I remember the exercise well, Marius said.And I kept my wits about me under duress, just as instructed.Of course, the reality had been quite different.Etiquette Tutor had assigned Claudia an arm injury, strapping it to her side and telling her to pretend it had been broken.Emilia was asked to elevate her leg due to a splinter.Both waited patiently for help, not seeming put out in the slightest.I had been restrained, blindfolded, and told to silently wait for relief.You have suffered a great shock and fainted, Etiquette Tutor said.My relief was a long time coming.And it was terribly easy.And Etiquette Tutor was very pleased with me, I could tell.Told the others I had shown serenity under pressure.If serenity entails withstanding uncontrollable shaking in complete darkness.Marius gave me a strange look.I mustnt go so far, I told myself.Though it was a tad bit scary, I said.I knew you would shine, my love.Marius reached out and took my hand.Just as Governess had ceased smiling, Marius no longer embraced me.I knew not to question, just hold tight to the most minuscule slivers of affection: an appreciative smile, a hand in mine.These must keep me going.Grace is about maintaining your dignity, said Etiquette Tutor.Stand with purpose and you will not fall.We all stared at the small circular platform sixty feet above us.The key to Maintaining Grace under Difficult Circumstances is to not appear under duress.Act the part, and you will succeed.Your elegance will be your safety.Luckily, there was also a massive inflatable cushion below to serve the same purpose.My training with Master had improved my flexibility and endurance.While the other girls spent their childhoods avoiding stained frocks, Id grown up racing through gardens and riding Veda and scaling synth trees that towered higher than that platform.This was my chance to show Etiquette Tutor she had underestimated my abilities and impress her.She wouldnt say so, of course, and still wouldnt like me, but she would respect me.I was still a child, I suppose.I believed in make believe, even my own.Cybele was the first to step aboard the lift and be raised to the platform.I could feel her fear surge, the expectation for failure tangible.Plummeting to the ground, in front of her peers?Even if the fall was cushioned, the humiliation would not be.Begin!said Etiquette Tutor, and Cybele lifted her chin and forced a pleasant smile.With that, Etiquette Tutor raised the small black remote in her hand and pressed a button with her long, thin finger.Immediately, the platform began to rotate, spinning slowly at first and gaining speed with each revolution.Cybele attempted to find her footing, only to stumble.Below, Etiquette Tutor clicked away, her face utterly devoid of emotion.Cybele never quite found her balance, though she lasted immeasurably longer than we thought in the moment.She fell, but she wasnt alone in her failure.For some, this trial lasted quite a while as Etiquette Tutor taunted them with her controller.She spun them one way and then the other, going from slow to fast to frenzied in an instant.For others, she began full force, watching them stumble and fall within a few seconds of stepping onto the platform.Bodies tumbled through the air, bloomers on display and limbs splayed at angles not befitting Proper Young Girls.We watched as each girl sat up awkwardly, her equilibrium destabilized, rising red faced and dress askew.Often the girl would stumble a few steps before regaining her balance.More than one hurried away, knowing it improper to become sick in front of the others.This lack of control, as Etiquette Tutor often reminded us, was highly disagreeable and outright disgusting in nature.Immediately, the trials would continue.Click.Click.Click.When it came time for Mica, there was a palpable sigh of relief.She would set a glowing example for us all.Mica smiled pleasantly to herself on the way up.Once she reached the top, she gave a tiny sigh, as though the task were simply another banana souffl.Her body held tall, she took her place on the platform.A dainty smile played on her bottom lip as she began to spin very, very slowly.She fell almost immediately.The girls sucked in their breath, a few even squealing.The fall seemed to take an eternity.When she landed, dress over her head and undergarments on display, the girls fought the urge to look away.Of course, that would have been against the rules.According to Etiquette Tutor, we must learn from the mistakes of others by fully observing their failures.I drank hers in.Even Etiquette Tutor seemed taken aback, signaled by a momentary flicker of her left eyebrow.Mica pulled herself together, unharmed but shaken.She glided back to her seat in graceful strides, just as we had all been taught, instantly regaining her self satisfied smile and regal manner.I could sense her utter humiliation.Even more, her powerful fury.Etiquette Tutor opened her mouth to speak, and we sucked in our breath in preparation.Even Mica was not above critique, we were sure of that, though the theory had yet to be proven.Perhaps this was her destined moment.Next up will be Livia Cosmo.Focus, Livia.The spin began slow and steady, the pace increasing in gradual increments that allowed me to adjust.Nimble, Livia.Steady, Livia.Beneath me, I heard Etiquette Tutor click the device, careful not to tense in anticipation of a change in speed.It could go slower, but it never did.I spun a little faster.Then even faster than that, as if I were at the center of a whirlwind.Click.The platform hurled me in frenzied circles, and all the while I could hear Etiquette Tutors click.
