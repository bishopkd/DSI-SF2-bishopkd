In a few days, either Dosia will be ours or Ill be dead.Either way, no one will care that on old fart like me had second thoughts.Zero was suddenly losing interest in all of the Beetar intrigue.He wanted easy answers, but he knew that was because he was young and idealistic.The universe was far more nuanced and complicated than he could appreciate.He had no horse in this race.He just had to do his duty.And if it was all going to be over in only a few days, like Frad said, then he wanted to get on with it to get back to Stacey as soon as possible.If that meant he had to kill a bunch of Dosians and save Frads life to get there, then so be it.He said, I need ammo.Of course.I have just the thing.How much do you need?As much as you can get.Frad smiled wickedly.I like the way you think.Come with me.Youre gonna like this.He walked through the foyer and down a flight of stairs.Zeros feet were too big for the steps so he asked if Frad would mind if he used his rocket boosters.Frad told him to go ahead, and Zero floated down the length of the stairs into a basement with a huge reinforced door blocking their path.The stairs were afire behind him, but they were made of some type of stone, so the little tongues of flame went out on their own.Frad ran his hand from the top of the door to the bottom and it hissed open.This is for Beetars only.Even the Dosian high priest isnt allowed through here.He thought Frad expected him to be honored, so he lied.Im honored.He ducked down, nearly folding himself in half to follow Frad through the door.Inside was a vault.It was no bigger than Frads office, but it had crates upon crates of ammo and firearms along one wall, with the other wall lined with food.Frad waved at the wall of canned and bottled food.Dosian food would probably kill me in a week, so I get care packages once a month.Some of it is pretty good.I havent had to go through the stockpiles of weapons yet, so Im just as excited as you are to see whats in here.Zero wasnt excited about weapons.He was excited to know that a few days from now he would get to leave, but to leave he had to survive, and to survive, he might just need some more ammo.At that very moment the entire building shuddered.Dust fell from the ceiling, and one of the bottles of food fell to the floor and cracked, spilling a black sludge everywhere that smelled like day old farts to his mechanical olfactory senses.The building rumbled again, but this time it was accompanied by weird alien screaming.Frad said, Theyre here for me, Zero!I got this, he said, as he tore box after box open, looking for ammo for his guns.Frad pointed at a crate and said, The ammo in there should be compatible, but its illegal for me to supply you with it.Your kind is not allowed to possess it.But under these circumstances, load up.He popped the crate open and started filling his forearms with as much of it as would fit.He closed the doors on his arms and said, Stay here.Frad was already holding a mean looking rifle, so he knew he was ready for the worst, and with Zero protecting him hed probably get it.He took a deep breath, pulled his guns, and rushed from the vault.Frads office had been reduced to a smoldering cavity.It was quickly filling with armed Dosians wearing protective gear that was plated in armor, but also somewhat mechanized.One of the Dosians picked up a huge chunk of outer wall and thrust it aside like it was nothing.Zero could do the same, but Dosians were slight and brittle looking.There was no way any of them had that kind of strength without technological help.He didnt wait for them to spot him.He fired first.He was as surprised as they were when the bullets hit, exploding like grenades upon contact.Not only that, but they released a concussive boom that knocked everyone within twenty feet down and disoriented the rest of them.He took advantage of the only opportunity he would get to surprise them by unleashing everything he had.When they spotted him, some of them ran, while others fired back.He floated in the air, dodging the occasional round but taking the bulk of their volley.They had advanced mechanized armor, but their bullets were ineffective, causing him minimal damage.He ran a line of sustained fire the entire length of the room and then moved in to finish off the stragglers.He emerged out into the open space that had been a fully furnished office mere minutes ago.He watched as Dosians scurried away, some running, others crawling for their lives.No one fired upon him.The threat was over.He floated through the opening, to the outside, and watched as hundreds, maybe thousands, of Dosians ran away.Some of them were bleeding thick yellow streams of blood.Others were dragging their damaged armor like it was a burden now rather than a benefit.A handful of armored vehicles drove off quickly, fanning in every direction.He didnt know which group to follow or even if he should follow them.If he left, maybe a second strike would come and finish off Frad in his absence.He flew upwards to watch from a higher vantage point.A round hit him and he tilted around, saw the gunman and killed him on the spot.Then two alien jets strafed him, hitting him with a few rounds as they retreated too.He took one down with concentrated fire, but the other got away.Other than that last futile attempt, no one fought back.They were cowards, which was good.Otherwise he wouldnt have stood much of a chance against so many of them at once.If that was the best the Dosian resistance had to offer, Frad had nothing to worry about.He waited for the screaming of the wounded to die down, then he floated back down to the ground.He stepped over writhing bodies of those whod survived his onslaught.He didnt know much about Dosian anatomy, but he seriously doubted theyd survive much longer.As if on cue, several of them stopped moving.He stomped through the wreckage and then the foyer.He floated down the steps and announced himself so Frad wouldnt shoot him in his confusion.Its all clear, sir.But you wont like how they decorated your office.Frad peeked his head around the doorway and smiled.Who gives a shit about an office?Im just happy to be alive.You saved me.For once, he wasnt an abysmal failure.And he respected Frad enough already to puff up with pride at his appreciation of his skills.On the other hand, he deflated when he was tasked with cleaning up the mess.Apparently none of the Dosians wanted to help, and Frad was too busy setting up a new base of operations, so that left him alone in cleaning up blood and guts.When he found a severed Dosian head that had the entire left side caved in, he started to have second thoughts about the way hed conducted himself.He filled a rolling dumpster lined with plastic with body parts and Dosian gore.After the sludge of death had been mopped up, he refused to help clear away the rubble, and in that Frad had his back, insisting the Dosians clean up the rubble themselves.Frad showed him into his new office, which was just across the way from his old one.It was just as big, but obviously hurriedly thrown together.A Dosian technician was busy mounting a single recharging port in the wall when they walked in.Another was sealing the windows with metallic blocks, while a third was installing a blast proof door.None of them looked thrilled to be there.Frad said, I need to handle some damage control for the rest of the afternoon, so make yourself comfortable.Zero stood at the back of the room as the Dosians avoided eye contact.Each time he looked at one of them he noticed a visible shudder overcome their limbs.They thought he was a monster, which, from their point of view, probably was not wrong.One after another, they left over the course of ten minutes, then he had a chance to overhear Frad speaking to the Dosian diplomats about the attacks.He was at his desk saying, My people will look at my death as an act of war.I need more help from your end to ensure my safety so that an alliance can be properly forged between our peoples.A Dosian diplomat replied in Beetar, Images of that protector who defended you have been circulating across the globe.My people are scared witless.If you wish to form an alliance, now is the time while we are still in awe of your might.Frad settled back in his seat.I see.What are the odds of a follow up attack?There will be no more attacks.The rebels expected to handle you easily after word of what happened on Cogmore, but they now know that will not be the case.Frad looked over his shoulder at Zero and smiled.He turned back and said, Good.Lets proceed immediately.He signed off and walked to the back of the room to join Zero.I had no idea your presence would inspire so much fear and awe in the Dosians.If I had, Id have sent for you sooner.He mumbled, Its too bad people had to die to get to this point.People die all the time.At least they died on their feet fighting for something they believed in.Zero nodded, even though he wasnt sure why hed just said that.So you admire the Dosians who tried to kill you because they died for their cause?I dont admire them, but I respect their commitment.Of course, Id prefer to succeed without bloodshed, but their sacrifice wasnt my idea.Anyway, as soon as the Dosian high priest signs off on the trade agreement, youre free to go.He almost jumped up in the air with excitement, but then his rocket boosters wouldve probably ignited and scorched Frad, so he was glad he kept his enthusiasm stuffed down.Frad grabbed his hand and tried to shake it, but it was too big and probably weighed as much as his entire body.Zero moved his hand up and down, making sure not to grip too tight.Frad let go and said, Ill be right behind you once this is finalized.I cant wait to get off of this forsaken rock.I thought you liked it here.Youre the first Beetar Ive ever met who seemed kind of happy.How many of us have you met?Just a few.Mostly Ive only passed them in corridors or listened to short speeches from them.He paused, realizing he had never actually interacted with his kind until now.I guess youre the first Beetar Ive ever actually known.We come in all varieties.Ive met some assholes, too, but that doesnt mean were all assholes.Frad was right.For some reason hed painted them all with the same brush, based on none of his own experiences.Hed listened to the Cogmore rebel Damon and let his personal experiences seep so far into his psyche that theyd become his own.Hed looked upon the Beetars treatment of Cogmore with disgust even though he had none of the facts.For all he knew, the Cogmores deserved such brutal treatment.Damon had kidnapped him and would have killed him.Hed helped Hobbs escape, but instead of quietly retreating hed killed everyone, including one of the only flesh and blood humans Zero had met out here so far, before escaping to the surface.From that perspective, the Cogmores were the evil ones.His own experiences with the Beetars were limited, and the only one hed ever actually spent any time with turned out to be a good guy.Frad added, Maybe you think Im different because Im a female.He almost did a double take.Frad was a woman Beetar?It blew his mind, but it affirmed to him that he was operating on preconceived notions that could easily be wrong.He said, I did not know that.Im sorry.Dont be.Im proud of it and Im sure we all look the same to you.He didnt want to tell her that was true.He worried it would sound bigoted.He waited for her to continue, but she just smiled impishly and walked away.His time on Dosia was coming to a close.He couldnt be happier.Sure, hed just killed scores of aliens, but that was part of the deal, and as long as he maintained that perspective, he could hold his head high and continue on.Frad spoke to several more Dosian diplomats over the course of the next two days.No follow through attacks occurred, but Zero was ready if they did.He spent his evenings standing still for hours on end with his eyes closed, trying his best to mimic the charge up stance Frad expected to see.It was lonely and gave him way too much time to think about himself.It was funny, but when hed had a real body on Earth, all he ever thought about was where to get his next meal and who he could trick into getting into his bed.Now he had no need for those desires, and instead of that coming as a relief, it made him ache inside.Hed do just about anything to eat a mouthful of seasoned rice or taste a womans skin.That thought made him wonder how Stacey was doing.Hed be seeing her again soon, and, hopefully, once they both fulfilled their commitment to the Beetars and were cured of their cancers, theyd get to spend some time together in the flesh.He could hardly wait.He was starting to worry if the desire would be there anymore when he got his body back.Maybe hed spend too much time as a robot and forget how to act as a man.The notion made him sick.He wondered about Earth.He didnt even know where it was in the night sky.Was it worth going back there?If he did, would it take eight hundred years to get there, or had technology advanced enough to get him there more quickly?How would his people view him if he told them the truth?He wondered where the rest of the cured went.There must be hundreds or thousands of humans out there whod been in his position at one time and now were out in the galaxy with freshly cured bodies.But if so, where were they?Hed only met a few flesh and bone humans so far.He assumed the rest went back to Earth, but that was an assumption with no proof to back it.He thought about all the cadets from his class whod died.He was one of the few lucky ones.Just as his thoughts started to irritate him with their perpetual recurrence, hed drift off to sleep for a while.It was nice to sleep and to dream, because his dreams bore no resemblance to reality.He escorted Frad out to the very same courtyard hed arrived at in the ship.She was going to sign the alliance publicly.He noticed that the destroyed section of building was nearly reconstructed.In a matter of two days, the Dosians had erased any signs of the attack.Frad stood before a smattering of important looking Dosians at a podium and spoke to them in their native tongue.Zero didnt know what she was saying, and he didnt care.He was too focused on making sure she was safe from potential dangers.She bowed when she was done, and the Dosians surrounded her.He tensed, but it turned out they were embracing one another, as was their custom.Frad smiled pleasantly and spoke intermittently to anyone who approached her.Then she returned to Zero.Im glad to have had you at my side.They recorded the whole speech.Every time a Dosian watches the signing of the alliance, theyll see you standing in the background and theyll be reminded of Beetar might.He smiled and followed her into the building as the sun went down.Theyd spent the past two days packing up her office in anticipation of her leaving Dosia.All that remained was her desk, bed, and his charging port.She sighed.Get a charge while you can.You ship out tomorrow.When are you leaving?More importantly, where are you going?Im heading to Ishca.Ishca is a penal planet.A hellhole.In a way, if Id known high command was going to reward me like this, I might have tried to fail just to stay here.Im sorry to hear that.Ive heard horror stories about Ishca.Are you going to be okay?Ill be fine.My station among my people is elevated enough to ensure my safety on Ishca.He asked, Can you get word to someone on Ishca for me?Who do you know thats stationed there?Shes a mech unit like me.Her name is Eve.Let her know I made it back to the Beetar warship in one piece.I might be able to do better than that.Ill do my best to have her stationed aboard the warship with you.She was already stationed there for an hour or so before they sent her off to Ishca as extra muscle.They probably wont just let her go back.That wont matter.I just brokered an alliance with an entire species.Ill get whatever I ask for, within reason.Then why dont you ask to get posted somewhere safer?Because I serve wherever Im needed.If I can help restore peace and order on Ishca, then its my duty to do so.Frad was a complicated Beetar.Maybe that was why he liked her.I understand.Thank you.Thank you, Zero.Frad personally escorted him to his shuttle, which would have felt like an honor until he saw that her ship was beside his, ready for departure as well.It still made him feel good that she wanted his protection right up to the very end.She said, Just strap in and the ship will do the rest.Thank you for all youve done for me.He yelled, It was a pleasure, but his voice was drowned out by the sound of the hatch on her ship opening up.She bowed at him from the doorway and then disappeared inside.Her ship started to lift off, so he got settled in and waited for his ship to do its thing.It closed up and lifted off without incident.He had scared the pride right out of the Dosians.They didnt even have the will to attack them when they were vulnerable, just in case he retaliated.He couldnt wait to brag about his adventure when he got back to the warship.Part 5:  Reunion    By the time he heard the warning buzzers and saw it, he nearly leapt from his skin.His shuttle had no defenses that he knew of, and according to the readouts on the screen, he was still about two hours from docking with the warship.One of those zippy blue ships was in front of his shuttle, matching his pace, and facing him almost nose to nose, flying backwards.He considered abandoning ship, with hopes that the Beetars would come and pick him up later, but that was beyond risky, and for all he knew the blue ship would notice him sneaking off and shoot him down anyway.Then he thought about going on the offensive.He had guns.He could open the door, reach out and blow that bastard apart.But by the time hed wasted valuable action time formulating various plans, the blue ship zipped away from him at baffling speed.He waited for it to return with back up or something, but that didnt happen.He had no idea why it had spared him, and he didnt trust his luck enough to really believe it had.Maybe it had planted a bomb under his ship.Maybe it put a tracker on it, or maybe it was trying to scare him right before it swooped in to finish him off.Only when the Beetar warship appeared on screen, and his ship didnt start ticking, did he know hed be alright.He docked noisily and he eagerly waited to see Stacey, Volts, and Piss pants.Because hed gotten so lucky on Dosia, he suddenly worried the universe would seek balance and devastate him now.Good fortune was not something he deserved, according to his recent history.He wondered what new bad luck would greet him to balance the ledger.So he was surprised to see three smiling mechs when the door opened.Stacey rushed in, saying, Good work on Dosia, Zero.Volts waited until she took a step back and then said, You finally got something right then, huh?He shrugged.Yeah, it turns out Im a badass.Piss pants smiled and nodded.Zero thought because theyd spent so much time apart, and hed never really gotten to know him as well as the others, each time they met up it unnerved him a bit.He could understand that.He wouldnt have cared much if only Volts and Stacey were there to greet him.Stacey asked, Are you charged?Do you need to juice up?I dont need to do that anymore, remember?Oh yeah.I forgot.Volts said, This place is awesome.I havent had to kill anyone yet.As long as you bow your head when youre supposed to and you cater to the occasional demand of our benefactors, everything is plain sailing here.I even helped Stacey and Piss pants install shielding around their battery compartments.I dont know if well ever need it, but its better to be safe than sorry.He remembered how giddy Winthrop had been to discover the shielding inside Zeros battery compartment.Hed said he would install it in the others and apparently hed done just that.It was the only way to explain how Volts even knew about it.Volts sure was chatty.Zero looked him in the eye to try to ascertain his mental health.Volts must have figured out what he was up to.Im fine.I had a breakdown or something, but Im over it now.I only charge once a day now, twice on boring days.Stacey took him by the hand.Come on.I didnt get the chance to give you a tour of the ship the last time you were here.I think youll be impressed.Do you think theyll let me stay this time?He said it half jokingly, but she replied anyway.Youre not going anywhere.Volts followed behind them and said, Eve is headed back to us too.We just got word.She should be here soon.He was going to tell them that he had put a good word in for her, but that seemed too much like bragging.Im happy to hear that.Im sure shes got tons of exciting stories.He was just glad to hear shed survived.He realized then that Piss pants had wandered off to take care of something or other.Volts matched their pace.So, what was your experience with the Beetar on Dosia?He knew what he was getting at.They were worried he had come back even more bitter and twisted than before.Volts seemed relieved when he said, Ive had a change of heart about Beetars.The one I worked with was awesome.Most of them are okay here too.Stacey stopped at the huge bay window so they could see the magnificence of space.It was as spellbinding as the first time hed seen it.He asked, Have there been any more attacks from those little blue guys?There have been a few, but nothing to worry about.One of them found my shuttle a couple of hours ago.It matched my speed for about a minute and then it flew off.Stacey looked at him like he had just told a lie.Why didnt it attack your ship?I thought you might know that.I dont.Thats interesting.I thought maybe it had used the time to place a bomb on my ship or a tracker or something, but I didnt see it do anything like that.She looked at Volts.Youd better go and check it out just in case.Volts started to walk backwards, saying, Im on it.Then he took off down the corridor at a sprint.When she saw the look of horror on his face, she said reassuringly, Its just a precaution.Im sure its fine.She squeezed his hand and said, Come on.Ill show you the rest.He didnt know why but she thought every little thing about the ship would interest him.After the fourth supply closet, and the third pantry, he said, You dont need to show me any more of those.Wheres the bridge or whatever they call it?They call it the command hub.Were working our way there.The Beetar quarters are just up ahead.Once they entered the hallway that connected to the Beetar living quarters, everything changed.The ship was alive with color.The walls were green and the floors pink, and then around the next corner theyd be yellow and red.Each door was brightly colored too, some having depictions on them that he couldnt quite decipher.Stacey let go of his hand, probably because it would freak the Beetars out to see them that way.Beetars passed them, smiling and yapping to one another.Zero and Stacey bowed their heads each time, but most Beetars ignored them.The few who bowed did so more for their benefit than anything else.It was the opposite of what he expected.It was pleasant.He tried to make out conversations, but it was too busy to make out any single sentence.By the time they made it through the living area, his head was spinning.When they walked through the next door, everything changed again.The control hub was enormous.It was peppered with work station consoles, and sitting at each console was a severe looking Beetar, hard at work.None of them looked up at them when they entered.A huge screen at the front of the room showed various images of the ship.One view showed the front, another the rear, and one tracked the zippy blue ships, losing them momentarily only to catch up to them again a second later.In the center of the room was an orb, twice as big as his mechanical body.Stacey saw him staring at it.Thats where the gunners work from.If the automated guns arent enough to get the job done, Beetars can control them from in there.If you ever get a chance to go inside it, itll blow your mind.The inside walls show a panoramic view of the space around the ship.When you go in there, it feels like you are the ship.A Beetar approached Stacey.It said angrily, We need more food and drink in here.Please fetch it when youre done doing whatever it is youre doing.Stacey nodded and then bowed.Zero wanted to bring his fist down on the top of the little bastards head, but he maintained control.When the Beetar turned on him and glared, he reconsidered his self control, until Stacey whispered, Bow, dumbass.He bowed in as disrespectful a manner as he could muster, but the subtleties were lost on the Beetar.It just walked away, satisfied.As Stacey led him from the room, she said, Some of them are better than others, but youll get used to it.Just make sure to bow from now on.He had just started to think Beetars were alright.When I get a chance, Im going to put my metal foot up that guys ass.That guy is a girl and shes the first mate of this ship.Dont act out of line, especially here.He nodded slowly.She was right, even though from his perspective it was the Beetar who was out of line.Hed been through too much to risk it all now.These Beetars were the real deal.They commanded a warship.They were not to be trifled with.He just had to get that through his thick skull before he smacked one of them upside the head and risked losing his life because he was too impulsive to control himself.Stacey led him to a pantry just two doors down from the command hub.Inside, it was stacked with fancy trays and eating utensils, as well as carts and crates of food.She lifted a cart filled with exotic flowers.She pointed her toe at another cart filled with wriggling alien fruits, still planted in soil.Pick that up.Dont try to wheel it out or youll snap the wheels off with your weight.He hefted the cart as it writhed with alien plant life.A fruit that resembled a banana except that it was black and oozed blood red liquid from its tip touched his hand as he carried the cart.It moved up and down against his metallic skin rhythmically.It creeped him out at first, but there was something soothing and mesmerizing about it.Stacey quietly entered the command hub and placed her cart gently on the floor just to the right side of the entrance.She nodded to the left side.Put yours over there.He put it down gently and the black banana moved away from his hand, leaving behind a red trail that was sticky to the touch and damn near impossible to wipe off.He felt bad for the banana.It was about to be killed and eaten by one of those blue slug monsters.Stacey walked out of the hub, so he followed after her.Outside, she stumbled against the wall.He rushed over and put an arm around her waist.She said, I must have overexerted myself.I need a charge.Can you help me?Holding her weight as she leaned against him, he asked, Why didnt you make sure you were charged up all the way?I cant charge all the way up.I can only charge for ten minutes at a time.Any longer and my databanks start to upload into the ports, and I cant have the Beetars knowing what I know.He wanted to ask what she was referring to, but time was of the essence.They made it past the Beetar quarters and into their cold, bland section of the ship.He picked up the pace as her body slumped into him even more.Piss pants saw him coming.He ran over and took her under the other arm.Together, they rushed her into the living quarters and hooked her up to a port.Her head flopped down and her eyes fluttered shut.Piss pants whispered, She cant charge for more than ten minutes or her battery starts to overheat.Then he patted him on the back and left him alone in the room with her.To his surprise, her eyes opened, and she was alert and awake.She whispered, I had to lie to him about it before he got suspicious.Why?Whats going on?The ports we use to charge also relay information about us back to the Beetars.They dont check it that often, but if they did and they found out what I know, theyd kill me in a heartbeat.Thats why I can only charge in ten minute increments.If I charge any longer, the ports open a link.What are you hiding?Whats your secret?It wasnt supposed to be my secret.Im not even supposed to be here.You were supposed to do this alone, but events unfolded in ways that couldnt be predicted and you allied yourself with me and Volts, Piss pants, and Eve.Now were all involved.He had no idea what the hell she was talking about.He thought it might be some form of delirium brought on by her lack of charge, but she seemed lucid enough.Charge up and then tell me everything.Give me ten minutes.Ill tell you what I can.As he walked out of the room, he wondered why she was even conscious.Then again, hed always had the ability to regain consciousness as he charged, while others couldnt.She was no different than he was.But that alone meant she was different.He was unusual and now he knew she was too.Stacey met him by the bay window.Youre not supposed to just stand around, getting in the Beetars way.Come on.Lets go somewhere quiet and talk.Volts walked up on them, happy and chatty.He couldnt have come at a worse time.To Zero he asked, How did you like the tour?It was an eye opener.Wait until I show you the bowels of the ship.We dont get to go down there unless were called for, but the next time I get called, Ill try and bring you along too.Sounds good.Its like were in two different ships.This part is clean and fancy and organized, but below us is utter chaos.I barely understand most of what Ive seen down there.Okay.He was starting to get irritated, but he didnt want to be rude, so he let Volts talk.He was his friend, after all, and he probably missed him during his absence.He could hardly begrudge him his enthusiasm.Eves going to be here soon.Ill let you guys know when she arrives.I cant wait to see her.Stacey said, I want to hear all about her travels.Volts had a jaunty step as he walked away down the corridor.Zero hissed, No more distractions.You need to tell me everything.She looked at him like hed just slapped her across the face.Settle down.When I tell you what I know, youll wish I hadnt.Ill be the judge of that.Lead the way.She turned and walked towards the docking bay.We can talk by the dock doors, and if anyone gets suspicious, we can say were waiting for Eve to arrive.He didnt reply.He didnt want anything, even small talk, to get in the way of finding out her secrets.He followed closely behind her, his mind racing.She stopped by the docks and looked around.Then she went to the corner and sat down, and he sat beside her.First of all, you dont have cancer.None of us do.Are our bodies healed already?Thats good news!No.They were never broken in the first place.The Beetars and their human accomplices tricked us into willful servitude.That makes no sense.I saw the x rays.My family has a history of cancer.You do not have it.Neither do I.  We were duped.But why?The Beetars needed us to pilot their mechs.Theyve tried various ways to get humans to do their bidding, but theyve found that fear works best as a motivator with our race.Fear of imminent death coupled with a promise to rid us of the very danger they concocted has worked wonders for them in manipulating us over the decades.I dont believe it.The Beetar I worked with on Dosia was kind and honest.She would have told me.Maybe she didnt know the truth.This is a huge empire with too many moving parts to keep track of.Do the Beetars on this ship know we dont have cancer?They do.This ship is their hub of operations.They know everything.So will we ever get our bodies back?She hung her head.Henshaw told me not to tell you.Tell me what?What does Henshaw have to do with all of this?She stood up and said, Hes right.If you know, itll alter your outlook.Tell me right now!As if the universe were conspiring against him, the proximity siren sounded, meaning a ship was about to dock.It must be Eve.Stacey seemed to relax at the momentary reprieve, but she wouldnt be getting off the hook that easily.Youll tell me the rest at the first opportunity.I will.A Beetar appeared out of nowhere.Stacey saw him and bowed, so he did the same.It said, I am your liaison officer, Zero.My name is Quiss.Im here to greet Eve.Its good to see you again, he lied.He barely remembered Quiss from Epigog, and he wasnt happy to see him.If you need anything, dont hesitate to ask someone else or keep it to yourself.He knew his expression must have been priceless.Stacey elbowed him in the side.Hes joking.Zero smiled awkwardly.This was the worst time for humor.Luckily, the weirdness was interrupted when the dock door opened onto the inside of Eves ship.She marched out, looked the Beetar over with obvious contempt, and said to them, I need to rest.Ive been through a lot.Quiss tried to introduce himself, but Eve cut him off.Can it wait?Im very weary.Quiss looked upset, but he was gracious enough to relent.He walked away as Stacey glared angrily at Eve.Whats wrong with you?You cant talk to them like that.I hate those pieces of shit.Ill talk to them any damn way I want.Come on, then.Lets get you that rest you asked for, Stacey said impatiently.Zeros curiosity about Staceys secrets waned ever so slightly, shoved aside by his newfound curiosity.What the hell had changed Eves mind about the Beetars so abruptly?The last time hed seen her she was scolding him about his distrust of them.It appeared their attitudes had flip flopped.As they made their way to the living quarters, Volts ran towards them.He hugged Eve, but she stiffened uncomfortably.She slowly pushed him back and said as evenly as she could, Give me some time to get used to being here, okay?Volts was visibly deflated.Sure.Let me know if you need someone to talk to.Okay.Ill see you soon.Zero noticed several dents and pockmarks in Eves armor as they walked.Char marks covered her left side.Her left gun hatch was buckled.It was then that he noticed a holster over her left shoulder with a gun tucked in it.She saw him staring.My guns jammed in there so I have this thing, she said, pointing at her holster.Stacey looked at it with concern in her eyes.You need to give that to me.I will do no such thing.You will if you want to stay on this ship.The Beetars will not allow weaponry in their presence.Eve shucked the holster off, letting it hit the floor with a thud.Stacey glared at her when she didnt pick it up.Do we have a problem here?Eve sneered.Dont test me, bitch.You asked for the gun.There it is.Pick it up and hand it to me.Eve turned and walked away, leaving Stacey exasperated and confused by the unnecessary aggression.She bent down and grabbed it up angrily, saying to Zero, What the hell happened to her?Has she always been so angry?He remembered that Stacey had spent almost no time at all with Eve.I dont know what happened, but she has definitely changed.Im curious to find out why.We need to contain her.If she acts this way around the Beetars theyll put an end to her one way or another.He ran with Stacey to the living quarters.They were both relieved to find Eve already there, sitting at a table, fussing with her gun hatch.Stacey hid the holster at the back of the room behind a stack of board games and then took a seat opposite Eve.Zero sat down because he felt odd being the only one of them standing.He asked, What was it like on Ishca?Eve reached across and put her hand on his.I forgot to thank you, Zero.That Beetar you helped on Dosia told me you requested for me to be reassigned to this ship.If you hadnt done that, Id probably be dead by now.He smiled, glad that his limited influence had made a difference.She was the only Beetar I met there that I didnt wish a terrible death upon.She was sweet.The rest of them treated us like cannon fodder.She leaned back in her chair and pried at her chest hatch.It opened and she reached in, pulling out the coil of cables that connected the two ports that shed made in orbit above Cogmore.She dropped the tangle on the table.Those things have been driving me nuts.They rattle around every time I move.Stacey picked the cables up, fingering them thoughtfully.I remember you talking about this.You said we could recharge from Zero using this cable, right?Theoretically, yes, it should work.Stacey plugged one end into her back and handed him the other end.It was the perfect solution to her predicament, but he was nervous.He had no idea if it would work or if it would cause them both damage.He plugged it in anyway.It caused him no ill effects.Stacey leaned towards Eve.I cant charge for more than a few minutes at a time with the mounted ports here.If she thought Eve would be intrigued, she was wrong.Eve said, Whatever.She didnt even ask why Stacey was still conscious.Zero asked, Does it feel like its working?Yeah.I can feel it.He wanted to make a sexual joke, but the timing was all wrong.Eve started a monologue to no one but herself.It seemed like she was exorcizing her demons or something.As soon as I got to Ishca, I came under attack.They keep all kinds of aliens there.Its like a Petri dish planet, with all kinds of swill mingled in one place.Its worthless besides being used to punish life forms.My landing shuttle went down from gunfire near the garrison, and it took them half a day to get through to me.
