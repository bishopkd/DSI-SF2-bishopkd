When you find her, youll know who she is.Thats what the voice in my head said.But who is she?What now?I ask her.Your craft.No way we can get there with them  A shrill, high pitched whistle cuts me off.Its coming out of airgirls mouth.Are you insane?You really think thats gonna scare PCF?Before I can finish my sentence, her gigantic white horse is bounding toward us, tail swinging back and forth.Its ...astonishing.Ive seen one before, but only in an Archive with her.This is as real as it gets.Horses are extinct, I say, mostly to remind myself.Then dont get on, she says, lowering the blade from her own neck.I grab her wrist before she leaves me completely exposed.Im staying with you, I say.Thats up to you.Still I catch the flick of her lower lip.Classic sign of hesitation.She has no idea how to get off her own island without me.She needs me and she hates it.I need her and I hate it even more.Im fearless on my speeder, cutting air at breakneck speeds.An animal is something else.Speeders and crafts dont breathe beneath you.They dont have minds of their own, unless carefully programmed.You cant initiate turbogear on a horse, but we go so fast it almost feels like flying.And I might fly off the side at any moment.Put your arms around me, she says.I hold so tight I could squeeze the life out of her.Thats one way to kill her, I guess.Less than a mile northeast, I say, checking the tracker with a shaky hand.And the PCF are right on our tail.Its tail.Whatever.All I know is theyre close.They wont fire if you stay close to me, airgirl says.Hold tight.Not a problem.Hurry, Veda, she says.The animal makes a weird noisea cross between a laugh and moanthen goes faster.Shes a different airgirl on this horse.They act almost as one.Now the trees are tall and dense, and the crafts are unable to follow us through without crashing.Airgirl directs the beast with precision.Her movements are quick, her muscles barely flickering.Veda pounds out pathways that never existed.Branches slap me with every bound.Id take dirt and rock any day over all this so called nature.A tree comes straight for us.Duck, airgirl yells, and I do, just in time.A thick branch brushes the top of my head.A second later, thered have been no head to duck.Duck!she yells again, and I realize I can die just as easily with her by my side.I check the tracker.Just about there, I say.Its coming up on the right.We see the smoke before the clearing itself.But its the fire that spooks the horse.It rises on two legs, making its version of a scream.Were tossed from its back and I crash to the ground.My shoulder ...I just did something to my shoulder.It feels loose.Im on my knees and my left arm just dangles there.I know how to fix it.I just have to clear my mind and ...The pain of popping it back in place nearly overwhelms me.Livia holds me steady, and all Im wondering about is why she hasnt kept running.You cant miss my patroller.Its right there.Half of it, really.All the pieces are there, just blackened and blown apart.We watch it smolder, and our escape plan with it.Whats left of it just explodes.I stagger to my feet and I help airgirl up and her horse is circling back, regaining its senses.We hold each other up until the horse comes.Hurry up, I say.I can hear them coming.They knew what direction we were heading.They didnt take us down because we always had nowhere to run to.Hurry, I tell her.Shes saying good bye to the beast.Youd think animals had feelings, the way its looking at her.She ignores my urgency, just stares into the horses big brown eyes.Whispers something.Of course I can hear.Now you have to run.Fast.Find a place to hide until this is over.Im going away for a while.Dont worry, girl.Ill see you again.I promise.The horse hangs its head ...crying?Creepy, I think.Sometimes I wish I didnt hear so well.She gives the horse a firm smack and it takes off.What are you looking at?she barks.Run for your life!I think she was almost crying, too.I follow her into the trees, deferring to her knowledge of this big floating rock.The crafts hover above the tree line, but its the men on the ground who worry me.I hear their feet behind us.We have a head start, but not much.Theres only one way off the island, she says, as if reading my mind.She does that a lot.Its starting to freak me out.Weve emerged into glaring spotlights, but she doesnt stop.She moves unnaturally fast and I race to keep up.Theyve probably infiltrated the heliopad, where all visitors land, and thats where we keep the air transporters, so flying away is not an option.Were moving so fast my silitex sheds my sweat at an unreal rate.A sharp pain in my shoulder.Ive begun to cramp up and I cant get enough oxygen.If Id planned better, if I hadnt rushed off, I wouldve taken a ventilator.I was too hotheaded.Airgirls barely winded, her face calm, her feet practically skimming the ground.Shes chattering on and on, like this is a social occasion or something.Audiofeed is in the main quarters.Lamentably, we cannot use it to signal a transporter.Speak like a human!Im huffing for air now.Breathe like one, she says.I cant ...theres something wrong with ...The altitude is not wrong, you are simply unconditioned.Id say something mean if I could spare the breath.Mariuss chauffeur would be an option, yet hes not  Here?I get it, okay!Whats left of my voice is ragged.Defeated.Theres nowhere for us to go!I run right into her long arm, stretched out in front of me.Shes come to a stop.Correct, she says serenely.Nowhere to go ...She lowers her gaze.I follow.Except down.Were staring into clouds.Theres a massive rig below the island.Its an enormous piece of raging metalwork, its frame an unsightly rust red, yet theres life on itmost important, a large synth nursery.It has been here quite a while, she says.Kanes rig, I think.Where he spied on her.If we aim for the foliage on the outskirts, perhaps that will cushion our fall.Thats a big perhaps, I say.Ive already dislocated my shoulder once today.A fall from this high would dislocate the rest of my body.Stop running, booms the speakerfeed, or we will actively engage.Drop to the ground now.The PCF handbook,  6.Restraining Enemies of Indra.Right after this comes the penalty of noncompliance.Death.Special Operative Lex, you have abandoned your sworn post, it says next.They know its me.Theyll stun us in three seconds, I say.Ready?Are you?She nods.Closes her eyes.Takes a breath.Now, she says.Together, we take a big leap over the edge.20           Livia   For the first second you fall gently.My dress billows out around me.Then it snaps up and I can barely see, the world goes white.On the island we never had trees with so many branches.I hit every single one, then I hit the ground.The pain lets me know Im alive.Barely.When I open my eyes, I tell myself, I will be somewhere other than Helix Island.Instead, Im staring into the eyes of Lex.Shes landed before me.It wasnt a race, but she just had to beat me.I gasp.I want to lie here.Thats all I want to do.I move my arms and legs and they feel like they belong to someone else.Are you hurt?I ask, sitting up.No, she says.Are you?I shake my head, amazed at our fortune.I start to laugh out loud at the audacity of our escape.Never have I seen a vision so beauteous, says a voice.As women diving from the sky.A young man stares down at me.Hes around my age, yet smiles in a boyish way.He wears a black helmet, his face streaked with dirt and grime.The sleeves are ripped from his uniform, revealing bare arms.We are definitely no longer on Helix.Proper Young Men maintain discreet attire, their flesh fully concealed, even when engaging in vigorous leisure pastimes.Then again, they also dont have RIGGER stamped across the blue fabric on their chests.Not surprisingly, the girlSpecial Operative Lex, I remind myselfhas already risen to her feet, braced to attack.So thats where she received her training, as one of Indras finest.She wanted to kill me, yet it was also PCF who beat her Kane.Something doesnt match up.And somehow Im at the middle of it.But why?The young man smiles at her.I see no need for that, love.Not until weve had a proper introduction.He doesnt intend to harm us, I say, back on my feet.Riggers are no better than scavs.Except they dont see girls here often.Harm is not what they want to do to us, I tell her in a firm manner, patting down my dress.Reluctantly, she lowers her fists.Nothing so vulgar.Im Hep, he says, then he points to the words engraved across his helmet.Garden Crew, I read, finding the actual letters disconcerting.Other than The Book of Indra, I have never seen words that were not holo.He nods at me, his face lit with pride.Not many scavs can tend an orchard like me.I try to comprehend, my mind racing.Gardeners, as those of Indra are well aware, serve in a position of utmost importance.Vital to Indrithian Society, for they are the growers of life itself, caretakers of our very existence, according to The Book of Indra.Synth trees may be birthed in the Aero Crown, but the gardeners are the ones who nurture them into beautiful specimens.They hold the key to oxygenating our world, literally giving us the air we breathe.A prideful bunch, gardeners.Even cocky.Few would waste their artistry on a rig.Hep, on the other hand, seems carefree.An artist and a ruffian.The Islands have so many beautiful women now, theyre just throwing them away?he says, still looking at me.He reaches out his hand to me, Lex wary of it all.Shes an oath breaker.She has much to be wary of now.I place my hand in his, diverting my eyes from the filthy fingernails.And yet all I see is that my own are not much better at this point.The Islands have a distorted view of all three of us.Im Livia, I tell him, and he bows graciously.I send Lex a knowing glance.These, I silently tell her, are referred to as manners.Great, she says.Now were old friends.But our new friends, theyre still ...She quiets suddenly.Heps dropped to his knees and is rooting in the dirt.Here we go, he says, removing several orange roots still caked in earth.He holds them out to her.Something to catch your breath?This isnt some tea party.Every time you take a breath, you wheeze.Shes from the Islands, but youre most definitely not.He takes a bite of the root with a loud snap.None of us living here are from anywhere even remotely aboveground.So we eat these.They used to grow carrots in the old world, but my own hybrid helps regulate oxygen in the blood.Then he smiles at us, teeth neon green.Boosters, Lex says.Try one, Hep says.All natural, plus theyll help you escape from whatever it is youre escaping from.I take one and Lex does, too.I brush away the dirt, and a few seconds after my first bite, I feel marginally stronger.Lex wont admit it, but I can feel her change in disposition.With her changing moods, shes not a lot of fun to be around.Thank you, I say.He reaches into a pocket and removes a small bottle, which he presses into my hand.It is filled with capsules.Ive dried them and powdered them, too.Its a nice blend.You hold on to these.I nod in thanks.So who is it thats got you on the run?asks Hep.PCF, I tell him.The change is sudden, Heps calmness evaporating.He drops the half eaten root.This is just the fight weve been waiting for.We wont let the PCF control us on our rig!Come over this way.I have someone for you to meet.The bulky man is named Durley and his helmet proclaims him Building Crew.Two patches are ripped from his pants, his knees protruding.He has the same RIGGER stamp across his chest, but has added his own sloppily scrawled addition: Im a RIGGER.Mine is Bigger.I focus on his shocked face instead.You growing these ladies as well?he asks Hep.Excuse my comrade, says Hep apologetically.Even down below they could tell he was a brute.Unless you count rig gals, which I do not.Rigger diggers, excuse my bluntness, arent exactly ladies.But whats this about, Hep?The PCF are after them.Durley goes silent, and then he explodes.Ill kill them!I reach for my humming zinger.Lexs fists are up before I draw it from my sheath.The ground rumbles as if the whole rig is groaning, a PCF craft is now hovering directly overhead.My teeth tremble, every part of me vibrating.Ive read of rigs destabilizing.Its rare, but entire crews have been lost.That we seem to be close to its outer perimeter has me even more worried.We all turn to where the thicket of trees part to reveal the sky beyond.Its engine whirs and sunshine glints off its silver paneling.There is nowhere to hide.Im sure that this PCF patroller is only the first of many.Follow me, Hep tells us.Were in no position to argue.21           Lex   The engines swirl up a cyclone of leaves.If we ever were to stop running, every part of me would be shaking.Our island leap has left me off balance.My brain most of all.The air up here clouds my thoughts, boosters or not.Were racing through the forest that borders the rig and recycles the air and keeps the local atmosphere clean and rich.Hep is ahead, leading us.Durley trails behind us.The big man doesnt quit running his mouth.If this wasnt a rig, hed be detained for agitating speech.Labeled instigator after the first sentence.Highfalutin thought enforcers, the sky high nerve of them!Ill tear apart every last one of em, just you wait.Rip out their insides and use em for fertilizer.Them softhead PCF.Them crappies, daring to mess with a rigger.Were fast, but not undetectable.The patrollers circle the rigs perimeter, waiting for us to emerge.They could just blast the whole forest, but they cant risk bringing an entire rig down.No, theyll go by the book.Its never failed them.Were not losing them!I yell.We dont want to, says Hep.Were gonna get those PCF bastards.They have my friend Kane, I tell him.Theyve hurt him, locked him up.We had a Kane here, says Durley from behind me.I slow some to run beside him.I always thought he was too pretty to rig.Hes breathing harder than I am.Liked the boy.Good with building.But riggers come and go like we got an open door.Make the vow, then jump off the side in two days.If they dont fall off first.I feel the uncertainty below my very own feet.Rigs are unstable, fitted from Lower Level salvage.These men sacrifice their safety to live up here.The rigs serve as havens for the dregs of Indra, Instructor once told us.Those who cannot function within society.Often recruited from Rock Bottom, for few would take such a job.The surface is unsteady; the minutest of interference might send hundreds plummeting.And yet the true dangers lie aboard: rabble rousing ruffians, always eager for a fight.I almost laugh.What would Instructor think if she saw me now?Riggers do want to fight, but at least its for a cause.Our cause.So whered they take Kane?Hep asks.The Independent High Council, says Livia.Shockedshe knew all alongI glare at her.Her back, unfortunately.I wouldnt be surprised if she was smiling.The Hickie?Riggers arent even allowed in Indra, let alone the Council building.It wasnt his choice, she says.Goddamn Idiots Holding Court!Durley yells.Where exactly?I say to Livia.High Security Detainment, she says.Anything more than that, well have to find out from the inside.You get the others, Hep tells Durley.We lose the PCF as Hep directs us toward the center of the rig.It wont take them long to find us again, so we cant waste the time weve bought ourselves.Now were belly to the dirt in a small clearing.This, I guess, is the rig version of a strategy session.Tell them the crappies are here, and theyll be coming aboard.Tell them they hurt Kane.Durley grins at Hep, nodding at every word; then off he goes.Theyll find us again, I say.Sure they will, and I hope they do.I got an engagement for them to attend.Itll take them a while to land.Theyll be careful coming into a hostile environment like this.So how do we get out of here?I ask.Is there a transporter?Sure.A big clunky rattler.Wont get you more than a few feet, though, before it starts losing altitude.Then you go express.He gestures down, down, down some more, then makes the sound of an explosion.Im questioning this alliance even more now.Maybe Im losing my edge, I think.One day in air and my brain is already fuzzy?Fuzzy enough to trust an island girl in the first place?You knew where Kane was all this time, I say to Livia.Of course, she says calmly.Then why didnt you tell me?Perhaps because you were trying to kill me.What happened to Kane?asks Hep.We had a disagreement, Kane and I, she says, shooting me a look.Reinforcement was called in, and when the PCF arrived, they wouldnt listen to my objections.A lot of them beat him until there was no hope of him fighting back.He was in no condition to fight in the first place.I attempted to stop them, but they wouldnt listen.Bastards!Wait, I say to her, so youre saying you didnt attack him?Yes, as I previously explained.The ground shakes.It makes my teeth rattle.Theyre nearby.Probably landing, says Hep, jumping to his feet.Cmon.We only got one chance of this.Now, surrounded by green bushes, there seems to be no entrance.Seems no way out, either.I turn to Livia.No need to check for the signs of a liar.Somehow, I just know.Airgirl is telling the truth about Kane.That memory Archive wasnt real, I suddenly realize.It was tampered with.What I saw wasnt what really happened.Things were cut out or rearranged.Im not sure how I know this, but I do.I also know who was behind it.Cassina.But my anger has made me core low dumb.I wanted to believe it was all true.I wanted to be angry.Kane being hurt by the PCF, maybe Cassina was the cause of that, too.No matter how much she cares about him, she hates me more.She was willing to hurt him if thats what it took to get me.Livia is watching me.I feel her stare all over.She didnt hurt Kane, I know that now.I still dont like her, but maybe I hate her a little less.Hep reaches deep into the green thicket.A click.A door swings inward.After you, ladies, he says.The inside of a rig makes the Rock Bottom dirt scavengers look civilized.This must be the center, the place they make their homes.It ascends high above with levels, platforms, and hoists, then drops to a seemingly bottomless pit.The pit has a series of landings built into the sides.The landings are crammed with riggers and their things.All men, as far as I can tell.They have cots and some have tents for privacy, though theres little they seem to be ashamed of.The ones we can see openly gawk and eyeball us.One more eyeball on their faces and theyd fit in with the mutations.Each landing is built of scrap: sheet metal, pipes, the hull of a transporter.Metal and plexi.Windowless frames, frameless windows.Disassembled shuttle tracks connect one level to the next.Cranes angled over us, the best way to get from point to point.All welded together.Some of the riggers are welding as we pass them.Constantly repairing and maintaining this space.And it only gets higher and higher.Skylight bleeds in from the imperfect seams.It is like some ancient carcass of former earth, stubbornly persisting in the modern world.This is Indras waste.The leftovers you never see.Collected from abandoned construction sites.The riggers set up and take away the trash and use it to reinforce the rig.Far above our heads, what must be the top, theres a wide platform.It could be a lookout, or just where theyve stopped building, for now.I can imagine Kane way up there, spying on the whole world from his kingdom of trash.If theres artistry in this assemblage, its lost on me.Its uncomfortable but functional.Uninviting.But I bet Kane loved it.Hep leads us under sagging piping.Hes nimbler than us.He also hasnt gone twelve rounds with an air breathing warrior princess.My bodys starting to feel awfully pained.I follow nonetheless.Livias in front of me.Her ridiculous dress is covered in dirt and grime and mud and blood.It looks slightly less ridiculous like that.We reach a wobbly ridge that juts toward the center.Take a seat, Hep says, motioning to a collection of shipping containers under an overhang about thirty feet up.The wing of a patroller angles down and were cloaked in its darkness.We sit.It feels great to get to do so.Youll be safer here, so rest while you can.Now I must see to a few details, so Ill say good bye for now.With that he takes Livias hand, bends his dirty face, and kisses it.She blushes.Theyre both enjoying this gross display far more than I am.And you, he says, leaning in close to me.No, looks straight through me, thats how it feels.Remember this, Lex.We live for a while, and then we die.Cant stop either when the time comes, so no use worrying about it.Thats the same for everyone.Even the outside of the outsiders.People like us.Then hes gone.Outsiders?Huh.Guess its that apparent.I probably smell like one now.Maybe Im more like a rigger than I thought.I belong to no one, just like them.And just like them, I could fall off an edge at any moment.Livia and I sit in silence.Ive nothing to say to her anymore.You believe me now, she says confidently.About Kane.No.Yes.You believe I didnt want him harmed.Though I had every right to want that.She nods.You no longer question Im telling the truth.Of that Im certain.Dont be certain.About anything.I turn my back to her.I understand a great deal more as well, she says.Kane had been watching me long enough to know my life.Intimately.Spying on my island from his rig.Perhaps this is why he seemed to understand me.You arent that complicated, I say.Just another airgirl.If thats true, then why would I be his target?I have no response.Ive been wondering this since Cassina slapped her battery pack of lies in my back and turned me loose.Not Kane, though.She didnt do this to Kane.No, he did it for some other damn reason.Theres something more going on here.I think about that marking in Livias eye.The one she shares with me.A tremendous horn breaks the silence.Were out of our seats and peering over the edge of the platform.Hep is looking up at us from the lowest point in the rigs center, the one spot clear of debris.PCF close by, we hear Durley say.We look upward.Hes standing on a platform many levels above us.Load of them going to hit any second now.Some landed on the edge and coming by foot.A few headed right here by craft.Excellent.Ready?yells Hep from below.Sure thing!says Durley.The other riggers cheer.Then send her off!A hiss precedes the trail of smoke shooting over our heads.It whistles sharply past the lookout platform where the rig opens overhead, and flames burst across the sky and rain on the roof.Dont worry, shouts Hep.Harmless little blast.That should get their attention, though.Now theyll know exactly where to find us.Then he looks in our direction.He cant see us, I know.Still, he seems to be staring right at me.He winks, then disappears behind some scaffolding.I hear the PCF patrollers faintly and Im on high alert and ready for whatever.I know their engines by ear now.The rig starts quivering.The engine sounds bounce around the metal and several craft do a flyby overhead.Landing on a level way above us.Thats when I see Durley jumping up and down.Hes right out in the open.Whooping and flapping his arms, his bulky body shaking with fury.Hes going to give himself a heart attack.Hes insane, I say.They all are.I suppose it depends on your definition, Livia says, just as the blasting begins.Though I supposed you would know.Durleys faster than I expected.He jumps, dodging one rapid fire burst, and after one more jump, he disappears.He get hit?asks Livia, intensely worried for his safety.We hear an ecstatic whoop.What do you think?I say.Only fools rush into battle, but Im itching under my skin.Here we are cowering under this overhang.I have no purpose in the shadows.Except Hep was right.I can see everything from here while remaining undetected.With all the energy a rig consumes, heat signatures must be off the map.Livias and my body heat wont even ping off their detectors, safe from their launchers and paralytics and all other sorts of hard core tech.Patience is a virtue, says Livia, picking up on my uneasy vibe.A virtue that sucks.I decide I hate her again.Completely.The PCF land and spill from the crafts.Their blasters hum off safety.There are more soldiers than before.More than I can count.PCF handbook,  6: Restraining Enemies of Indra.See those camera devices attached to their helmets?I tell Livia.Its standard to run videofeed on every op and send it to the IHC, so dont let them see you.She looks at me like Im insane.She opens her mouth to contradict me.The clever girl probably has a better option.Hep has other plans.Nice of you to visit!I hear him holler.The PCF all swivel like they share one brain.Theyre hive trained, not your standard troopers.Their hand cannons all aim low, in the same direction: the clearing below.Heps back in the same spot we saw him last.Hes also got a big gap toothed grin.You looking for those girls?he shouts, sounding friendly.Tell us where they are.That same mechanical voice from the speakerfeed.Anonymous.Authoritative.I saw them.I think the taller one had a thing for me.Gave me a look, sure you guys must know the kind.Strapping PCF like you?Must have your pick of the ladies.The PCF officers faces are hidden by their helmets and goggles, but theyre anything but amused.Tell us where they are.Well, they were moving pretty fast.Could hardly keep up with those long legs.Whats he doing?asks Livia, her voice shaking.Hopefully not being an idiot, I say, harsh enough to disguise my own nerves.On order of the Independent High Council, you are hereby commanded to reveal all knowledge as it pertains to the whereabouts of known enemies of Indra.Heps silent for a moment.He points high above us.The platform at the very top of the structure, hundreds of feet over our heads.The one I know Kane must have loved.I saw them climb that way, he says, whistling at the dramatic height.He cocks his head to the left.You fellows are welcome to take the hoist, of course.Quicker that way.The PCF swarm toward him.Some break off to canvass the area, weaving through the warren of platforms.They move cautiously.I would, too.Too many hiding holes and blind spots to set an ambush.Hep is all but forgotten.He watches them storm his home level by level, smashing it to bits.He gets the attention of the lead officerthe one doing all the speaking.Hey!he shouts.Ive seen that look on Heps face.Made it myself.Hes not changing course now, the stubborn fool.Hep knows exactly what hes doing.Theyre not known enemies, okay?Just girls.You ought to let them be.He marches up to the officer.You hear me, crappy?Let them be.Let us be.You cant control everything.Even if you think you can.We wont be controlled by you.He smiles.This world is changing, and theres no place  The bark of a blaster and Hep falls where he stands.22           Livia   His eyes looked directly at me just as the life went out of them.They were alive with anger, yet inside I sensed he was peaceful.Cmon, Lex says, though it sounds like its coming from very far away.Shes tugging on me, but I feel as though Im at a great distance.I mean it, Livia.We gotta go now.I cannot be moved; my bodys turned to stone.We have to hurry.Theyll kill us, too.Another tug, harder this time, yet just as pointless.Surely it must hurt, but I feel nothing at all.Ill leave without you.I swear it.Another pull, the voice agitated.You think being special will get you out of this?Perhaps its the word special that brings me back, but suddenly Im there, my senses returned.And Lex is right there next to me, yanking my arm violently.I sense her hopelessness and desperation and, even more, something that surprises me.Shes afraid.Deep within hera place she would never admit to havingis a tiny shadow of fear over her heart.She can no longer fathom doing this alone.She needs me, even if she doesnt know it herself.Ill bear this burden with her.But first, Ill let her beg, if only for a moment.Listen to me, okay?she says, almost dropping to one knee.I stare off into space, unmoving, collecting my thoughts.We have to go.Now.You gotta come with me.A sigh, her frustration increasing.Get up, Livia.I need you to ...just get up.I need you.Please.I turn to her sharply.I hope you know what were doing.We move fast and low, crawling through the riggers sleepers, remaining in the dark.Lex seems to know where shes going.You always mark the exits, she whispers.Whenever you enter somewhere unfamiliar, thats the first thing you do.But where are we going?This is not the time for questions.Hep, I think, slipping around a corner.The gardener.He looked me in the eyes, then nothing at all.The PCF pile into the hoister that will lift them to the top platform.Theyre huddled together, an unmoving mass of black silitex and aggression.A few stay behind, keeping watch of the ground level.Heps body lies at their feet.Oh, I say, shocked to find us standing over a second dead body, this one much larger.Theres no time to think, let alone mourn Durley.I hardly knew him, yet he sacrificed himself for us.What am I to think of that?Were we worth it?Weve climbed all the way to the roof of the rig, where the winds are strong.That booster energy is all Lex is running on, and by now its wearing thin.Im not far behind.I can hear the hoister on its way up.Hep mentioned a craft, didnt he?I say.Big clunky rattler.Wont get you more than a few feet, though.Well, wont help us much if its a dud, will it?It doesnt have to be that craft, does it?I say.Together we choose the patroller the farthest from the others.The pilot is still inside, watching a live feed of the op on his monitor panel.Confirmed, he says.One boy.Bad attitude.Anti Indrithian Hate Speech....Copy.Got a heads up from the dead kid before we took him out.Seems the girls fled topside.One is PCF, but she turned.Team going after them right now.I draw the zinger.Its already humming.Quiet that thing!Lex whispers harshly.Cmon ...whats a sword gonna do against a blaster?Plenty, just as it did to you, I want to say, yet stop myself.Egotistical, pretentious little girl.You still have much to learn of our world.I head toward the pilot, Lexs disbelieving fury coming in waves from behind me.Im the soldier, shes thinking, already braced to spring.And now I will be forced to jump in and save you.The hoist has risen to the top.The doors are opening.The pilot is still fixated on his monitor.Now theres a zinger blade to his chest.What the  I kick him in the gut and use his own weight against him to pull him out of the cabin and throw him to the ground.Two hard strikes and hes not speaking.I lean over, delicately removing his blaster.I toss it underhand to Lex, having not even broken a sweat.Well, are you coming or not?The hoist gate opens.The PCF spill out and the platform between us is vast and empty, but it wont stay that way.Lex sits in the pilots seat and I take the one next to her.Get it going!I say.One engine hums, then the next.It takes time, she says.The PCF move quickly across the platform toward us.We cannot take them all.Then from out of the nowhere, the riggers mount the sides of the platform.They crawl up through the gaps in the landing zone.They were already there, hiding and hanging underfoot just below the surface, ready and waiting to attack the unsuspecting PCF from every angle.They brandish pipes and tools fitted with spinning metal blades and drills made to crack granite.Lex has the patroller in the air as the riggers engage, and they whoop loudly as the two groups break against each other.Im glad we have risen above it.The violence sickens me.I can only hope the riggers have their justice.Lex works the control panel as though its an extension of her hands.Shes afraid of good natured Veda, but this machine doesnt faze her.Nor does shooting into the sky at disarming speeds, apparently.I clutch the arms of my seat, a shriek escaping.Strato, huh?she says with a smile.Next to her is the pilots backup blaster, which she surprised me by pulling from a compartment under his seat.Standard procedure, shed said, running her hand over the weapon lovingly, as though being reunited with a long lost friend.Her good humor doesnt last long.He planned it, she says.Hep gave himself up to lead those PCF into the trap.She sighs.Durley, too.And they didnt mind dying, I think, just to make it happen.And now ...the IHC?I say.I already set the coordinates.I nod.Why would they die for us?I say.I dont know.I think it probably wasnt for us.That their grudge was older and nastier than either of us can comprehend.Trouble has been festering between PCF and Riggers for a long time, and now its turned into very real violence.Lex and I rip through the sky, headed straight for the tallest, most magnificent building in the City of Indra.We dont talk.Theres not much to say.23           Lex   One is PCF, but she turned.Thats what the officer said.Right before Livia pulled him out of the patroller and left for the riggers to tear him into bloody pieces.I was a cadet.Rock Bottom Patrol.I lived by my mission.I was never disloyal.The only ones who turned?The PCF.On me.Now Im right back where I started.Alone.Outside the outsiders.Except for Livia, I guess.I got her whether I like it or not.And Ill get Kane, even if it kills me.I look at the airgirl next to me.Shes clenches her teeth, scared of the ride.Ill get Kane, I think, even if it kills both of us.Im pushing this PCF patroller to its limits.Probably doing serious damage to its engine, but its worth it to see Livia practically hyperventilating.Less than a day and the City of Indra has already changed.The glossy sheen has grown sinister.Even the light looks wrong now, like its one spark from igniting.What we just saw, we cant unsee.Whos there left to trust?I cant even trust myself.I pull up the High Council blueprints on the positioning monitor.The detainment center is just a few levels down from the High Council halls.Cadets receive placements here.Its not an honor, but there are worse assignments.High securitys a given, I tell Livia, talking to her, but not really.Thinking my strategy out loud.She nods anyway.Were about to infiltrate the most secure locale in all of Indra, I think.Were defined by the impossible feats we attempt.Especially if they lead to our deaths.We have no other options if we want to find Kane, Livia says.I hate when she does that.Just full of herself, thats all.No mind reading in that.Girl thinks shes got all the answers.Theres no we, I tell her.What do you care about Kane?She doesnt respond.Im having second thoughts.I couldve booted her out at any passing island.Look, you should back out.Right now.Before its too late.She wont look at me, but shell hear me.Tell them I held you captive.Theyll buy it.Ill even hold one of these blasters to your head for the feed.You can make it to your island for evening rations.Be in your fancy sleeper by lights out.No, she says intensely.Just like I knew she would.Its her pretty head, after all.Her right to part with it.Of course, theyll go for my head first.But still.You had your little adventure, okay?But even with that rig chaos, it wont be long.Theyll be onto us in  A high pitched beep squeals through the cabin.Craft 247 cleared for touchdown on IHC landing pad.Too late, she says.Perhaps they dont know  That we hijacked a craft?Of course they do.Theyve seen the feed by now and theyll be looking for answers.Well, she says calmly, what do you suppose our next action shall be?Shes gripping her new blaster before I even say the word.Give them what they want.24           Livia   Ive always wanted to see the New Indra Gardens in all their magnificence atop the Independent High Council building.Only I never imagined seeing them quite like this.We glide toward the landing area, and I can make out a dozen figures on the heliopad hovering beside it.With only a narrow walkway connecting them, the heliopad seems to float in the air.They figure we have nowhere else to go, Lex says.We land and theyll have us surrounded.Were even closer now.I can make out their blasters; definitely unfriendly.What shall we do?I ask.Land, of course.Lex is grossly determined.She takes a beating, literally, and pushes for more.She probably thinks its her turn to hand one out.Coming in now.Steady and smooth, just like I taught myself.You taught yourself?I know the rules.Far be it for me to break some.The engine squeals.My head whips back as we accelerate forward.We slam down on the heliopad with a horrendous metal on metal screech, our bodies plastered against our seats.The PCF scatter.It appears theyre not prepared for the unexpected.We may have a shot yet.We blow by them and keep going.Accelerating right into the New Indra Gardens.Gardens showcase the utter mastery of natures true beautyor as much as weve been able to replicate.The New Indra Gardens are for Indrithians of the Utmost Importance; those select few who make the Great Indra so very great.Waslo, I believe, sees them daily, as my father once did.A trained, high level garden crew maintains them at all hours.They are like insectsfortunate, because there are none here to aid in growth and pollination, yet at all times the flowers are at the peak of their bloom, fragrant and vibrant and strong.They grow in concentric circles, and if you followed the pathway to the center youd find an ancient marble fountain, caressed by lush vines, eternally flowing, upon which a winged victory perches as an exemplar of Indras perfection.The gardens, says The Book of Indra, are the epitome of pristine, untouched beauty.We speed into the expanse of programmed vegetationuprooting trees, slamming through sculpted bushes, exploding greenery and flowers all around us.Next to me, Lex wrestles the controls, trying to break our momentum.I know, within moments, we will fly over the edge, plummeting from the very top of the tallest structure in the City of Indra.This must be the end, I think, just as my body heaves forward.Were caught in a violent roll.The metal hull groans as its impacted and I fear at any moment well be crushed.My insides are shaken and I grip the armrests for some semblance of control in this violent, grinding landing.I must have blacked out, because when I open my eyes Im not quite sure how or when we stopped.I sit there, unmoving, in the disconcerting silence.I look over and Lex is clutching her seat, eyes wide, and I can feel every bit of her shock.I need not sense her, for these are also my feelings.For once, were perfectly in synch.Did you feel that?she asks.Are you attempting humor?Of course I felt my own death calling.No ...the drops.I dont answer, for the sudden pounding speaks volumes.We both look up, the sky visible through the newly ripped hole in the roof above us.A cascade of water greets us, the torrent quickly drenching us.Out!Now!screams Lex, and we open our doors and scramble, falling onto the grass.Disoriented, I watch, awestruck, as the water keeps falling.The fountain, says Lex next to me.The fountain is all that stopped us.Her voice is gravely serious, as though this is a great philosophical revelation.Then she begins to laugh.She shakes her wet hair, the spray flying everywhere, and laughs hysterically.I cant help joining her.Were being hunted, yet we laugh like truly demented people.They will take us to Sunrise Retreat, I think, and that might well be the correct decision.Perhaps we laugh because we just destroyed a legendary fountain and garden, or because were soaking and only growing wetter.Perhaps we laugh simply because were not dead.A crowd of Indrithians stares at us with the maximum amount of shock they can display without breaking social contracts.Im sure they would try to capture, restrain, or contain us if they didnt pay numerous PCF to do their dirty work for them.Oh, Im sure these people loved their gardens, and my eyes scan over our path of wreckage, the laughter dying down.That felt good, Lex says, holding up her blaster.She nods, seeing that mine is already in hand.Cmon then.Lets go get Kane.25           Lex   We race through the ruined gardens as high pitched alarms sound.Man, weI, I guessdid some bad things.After we pass through the uprooted shrubs and fallen trees, petals and leaves left now to the mercy of Indras artificial winds, I start to enjoy my first time in a real garden.Im overwhelmed by its size and beauty, and if I looked back Id start to feel bad for the devastation.My boots stick in the mud thats everywhere, thanks to the fountain.Beads dribble down my silitex.I have no reason to look back.Have you the faintest idea where we are?Livia asks.Through here, I say.She shakes her head.You are far too comfortable with this level of destruction.We should take more care.Be more careful once we go inside.I look at her.Her and her feelings.This long hallway has dead people watching from holo images mounted on the wall.I can hear her footsteps right behind me.So, she got over it.Too comfortable?What does that even mean?I know military operations and strategy.I dont do feelings.Shes already slowing me down.Already jeopardizing the mission.She sighs.Whats your problem?I say, swinging around.Shes got her humming sword pointed right at me.Not again.Really?I hurt your feelings that  I dont even get to finish before shes leaping toward me, her sword flashing in a silver arc, its melody acidic.There is a PCF soldier behind me.The zinger cleaves his blaster in two.On the upswing it cuts through his chest.His face is on the young side.It is full of shock and disappointment and bears death in no more a dignified way than the rest of us.Livia   I killed him because you didnt listen, I say.Lex doesnt respond.Next time, heed my warning.This man is no longer living, I think.And for that, Im responsible.He wasnt an Archive opponent who will refresh with the next chip insertion.This is a real man made of flesh and blood.The blood pools on the floor beneath me.A strange dull ache in the pit of my stomach swells, one word repeating in my head over and over: killed.A strange look passes across Lexs face.Shes staring at one of the enormous holo images now, distracted.I reach for her, gripping her wrist and squeezing hard.That couldve been me, she says.But it wasnt.Im sorry.She is.She really is, but its too late for that.We must be merciless if were going to survive.We can sort out our feelings later.Kane, I say firmly.Kanes still waiting for us.Her eyes reignite.She catches up and we hurry down the hallway.The dead mans face lingers in my mind.Both dead men, to be exact.The guard sprawled across the ground, his body rapidly cooling as his life spilled out.And the other dead man, his handsome image on the portrait at which Lex was paused.Dr.Armand Cosmo read the plate beneath it.Modern Genetic Innovator.My father.Lex   I knew that guy.Id seen him before.Livia knew him, too.Cosmothey share a last name.Her ...father?Her breath hitched for second, just like mine did.She saved me.She really did.The glass transporter tube begins to glide down the side of the building after I enter the Detainment code.The tube buzzes.You can see the whole of Indra from here.Its a monument of impossible wonder, and it only reminds me that they have so much more up here.Its hard to be so proud of this city, or act in its favor.We stop suddenly.The entry panels slide open and we step into a narrow hallway.I open the tube control panel and punch in numbers.My mind clicks off combinations.Do you care to tell me what youre doing?Livia asks.Im breaking the code.So they cant get in, I say.The alarms have followed us, even all the way down here.The place is on high alert.I punch in another set.Theyll locate us.If they havent already.I just need to buy us a few minutes.I pull my hand away for a moment and her sword eviscerates the panel.It sparks and goes black.Let us see if they can reprogram that, she says.I grit my teeth, frustrated.Shes getting too quick with that thing.But then we cant either.
