They didnt do a very thorough job of searching us, Helena replied.Levanochs hubris is great, Drkp croaked.Hes taken only weapons from us, thinking nothing else would be of aid in escaping.Hes just trying to induce Stockholm syndrome.He believes the gregarious gesture of not immediately violating us will create the impression that he is not overtly cruel, and make us more willing to help him.We must turn this deception against him.Shush, try not to speak, Helena said softly.What exactly are the Scraumudi anyway?Are they insects?Ilene asked.Arthropods would be the term, Helena told her.I thought it was impossible for insects to get that big, Ilene said.No, its completely possible under the right circumstances, Helena said.Back in the Carboniferous era on Earth there were giant insects.Dragonflies with meter long wingspans, cockroaches the size of housecats, and millipedes over two meters long.Its because the atmosphere was around thirty five percent oxygen back then.There are naturally occurring Sapient insects you know, like the Kylilyimacs.Theyre as tall as Humans, and the atmosphere on their homeworld is almost fifty percent oxygen, and it has nearly a third less gravity.Yeah, but the air and gravity here feels normal, Ilene stated.According to my scanner, the airs twenty four percent oxygen, seventy three percent nitrogen, and three percent other gases.The gravitys 1.08 Gs, Helena said.But the Scraumudi arent naturally occurring, so the Telarri probably went to a lot of trouble to make them able to function in a wide range of environments.Why wouldnt they just make them humanoid?Ilene pondered.I mean most Sapient races are humanoid anyway, and I was always given to understand that was because of parallel evolution or whatever.Thats right.Species that occupy similar niches in similar environments often become similar in appearance and behaviour because natural selection favours the same traits in those species, even if theyre not related, Helena replied.Its why dolphins look like ichthyosaurs, why wombats look like groundhogs, and why Drkp here has two arms, two legs, and a head with two eyes, two ears, a nose and mouth.Sapient races from Oasis class planets are often humanoid.Maybe thats why the Telarri made the Scraumudi the way that they are, so that theyd look like monsters to most other races.Well theyre ugly sons of bitches, thats for sure.I never wanted to be killed by aliens that were so ugly, Ilene said.Id hoped that if I was killed by an alien it would be some sort of shape shifting succubus, and she would take the form of a beautiful naked woman.Shed seduce me and as we were fucking, shed suck the life force out of me and use it to nourish her clutch of eggs.Can you detect any other Humans with that thing?I dont want to alert the Scraumudi by using an active scan, Helena replied.And passive scans cant tell individual life signs from the ship.What about your clairvoyance?Cant you tell if the rest of the crew is alive?Ilene asked.Sometimes I can sense Scraumudi passing by on the other side of the door, but no further than that, Helena replied.Maybe my proximity to Drkps tin foil hat is affecting me as well.Does it hurt much?Drkp shook his head.Im fine.I wish we had some antiseptics.Id hate for those wounds to become infected, she said.Dont worry yourself.Im impervious to infection, he informed her.Well Im not, Ilene said as she looked at the wounds on her arm.She was in fact almost impervious to infection, and her wounds had almost fully healed, but she had been complaining about them a lot.I still dont know why this thing is dampening your powers, Helena said, now completely ignoring Ilene.Which is understandable, since psychic powers are paranormal and cant be directly observed.From what I can tell, your tin foil hat is sending mild neuroleptic pulses through your brain and nervous system.Id be interested to see if giving you a neuro stimulant would help to counteract its effects.But for now, I dont think theres anything I can do.I havent been able to identify the devices power source, and I dont think it would be a good idea to just try yanking it out.I concur, Drkp nodded.It would be imprudent to attempt to remove or deactivate the device.Question: out of six hundred million Reticulans and close to twenty million Enclaveans, why is it that none of you saw this coming?Ilene demanded.Drkp sighed in annoyance.Ive explained this a thousand times to a thousand people, he began.Precognitive visions are unsolicited.We cannot peer into a future time and place at will and see what happens.Our visions are unprompted and fragmentary, and they are not always accurate since they typically only show us probabilistic futures.In addition to being exceedingly rare even among Reticulans, visions almost always retain only to the individuals receiving them, which is why no one else foresaw that this would befall us.As incredible and terrifying as it may seem, us being pulled out of the Universe and captured by Levanoch was apparently neither certain enough nor momentous enough to induce a vision, even in me.Precognition is, in many respects, the most useless and unreliable of all our powers.Does this satisfy you?Ilene, this really is taxing for him.Would you please leave him alone?Helena requested.Fine; but just for now.I will have more questions later, Ilene said.Helena sighed and placed her scanner back in her pocket.She sat down beside a quiet and distant Marc and rested her head on his shoulder.Are you okay?she asked lovingly.Marc nodded unconvincingly.Marc this isnt your fault.You couldnt have predicted this would happen.Drkp and I didnt predict this and were supposed to be psychic.You did everything in your power to protect us.Theres nothing else you could have done.I could have surrendered to Levanoch when I had the chance, he lamented.No, Drkp is right.The Scraumudi belong in here, Helena told him.Theyre dangerous.If we were to help them escape wed be guilty of unleashing a terrible evil upon the Universe.We cant do that, no matter what.If we have to die, thats a small price to pay to protect trillions of Sapient beings.No matter what Levanoch does or threatens to do, we cant help him.Marc slowly nodded his head in reluctant agreement.Suddenly Helenas eyes widen with alarm as she looked at the door.Theyre coming in, she warned.The doors immediately slid open and there were two Scraumudi standing there, one of whom held a rifle.The other began speaking in their abominable tongue, pointing at Marc and Drkp.He gestured for them to stand up.As Marc rose, Helena desperately clutched at his arm.Dont go!she begged, with tears welling in her eyes.Theyll kill you!Ill never see you again!The armed Scraumudi struck her with the end of his rifle.No!Marc cried.Dont hurt her!Im coming with you.The two Scraumudi herded Marc and Drkp between them, with the armed one bringing up the rear.Helena threw herself at the shell like doors as they slid shut, and she pounded ferociously at them, screaming.She finally dropped to her knees and wept bitterly.Ilene gently approached her with a keratin bowl full of water.She wiped the tears from her face and handed her the bowl.Helena, we dont know that theyre going to kill them, she said in the most sympathetic voice she could manage.They probably just took them for questioning.They might bring them back.Just dont give up, okay?Helena took a deep breath and nodded.Were going to escape, and youre going to see Marc again.You just have to keep yourself together.Drink your water.Helena took a deep draught from the bowl.Okay, Im okay, she said, taking a deep breath.Why did you try to attack the Scraumudi that Drkp was shooting?I didnt know what would happen, she replied.Exactly.You saw bizarre energy coming out of a Reticulan weapon.It made the Scraumudi glow.Did it not occur to you that touching it would be incredibly dangerous?I didnt really think it through.I was running on adrenaline, Ilene replied.If you hadntve done that, Drkp might have been able to stop the Scraumudi from taking the bridge, Helena claimed.If we kept the bridge we could have taken back the whole ship.Youre saying this is my fault?Ilene asked in dismay.Im saying what you did was extremely stupid, and it may cost us our lives, Helena replied.It may even cost every Sapient being in the Universe her life.Really?Well Ive always wanted to go down in infamy.I guess I cant be anymore infamous than the dyke who killed everyone in the Universe.Helena glared at her inimically.If the Scraumudi escape she began.I know, theyll start raiding every inhabited planet and colony they come across, maybe even wipe entire races out and therell be a bunch of epic space battles to try to stop them.It sounds kind of cool actually.Helena shook her head in disgust.How the hell did you ever get to be an Executive Officer?she asked.A self deprecating smile crept upon Ilenes face.Marc, she replied simply.When I first met Marc on the Artemis he was depressed, because of you I guess, and I helped him through that.Thats why hes always liked me.I was just one of the Artemiss Deck Techs, I didnt really have any ambitions beyond that.I did my job, and then banged as many hot girls as I could.I pissed a lot of them off too.I thought that the Astragnostic Society might discharge me for being such a disruption.Looking back, I really was kind of a bitch, but I was kind to Marc when he really needed it, and thats what hes always seen in me.So when he was transferred to the Cygnet he not only took me with him, but made me his Chief Deck Technician.No one on the Artemis had a problem with getting rid of me.Maybe if you werent so good at your job you might have been able to stick with Marc.Anyway, when Marc became the CO of the Lacrymosa, he granted me a field commission and made me his XO.The Brass thinks Im the worst XO theyve got, and if they were to pair me with any other Captain theyd be right.But no one can work with Marc the way I do.It may not be apparent, but we complement each other perfectly, and we owe each other a lot.I love him too you know.Hes like a brother to me.I understand, Helena said with a sympathetic nod.She got up and walked over to the water dispenser at the back of the cell.It was a small recess in the wall, with a limp trunk like organ hanging down on the left to dispense water.There was a trunk on the right that dispensed a red mash, which they assumed was made from the algae Drkp had mentioned.There were also two slits in the back which dispensed red crackers and protein cakes.In the corner of the cell was a mesh covered hole which they had assumed was for their waste.Above the dispenser was a panel of some viscous fluid.Helena placed her hand upon it, as Ilene had first done earlier.She gasped and quickly withdrew her hand.Its gross, I know, Ilene said.No, its not that, Helena replied.When I touched it, it felt like, I dont know.You remember that Drkp said that the Scraumudi have a telepathic interface with this ship.These panels must serve as some kind of manual backup.When I touched it, I think I was sensing the ships neural activity.What?Let me try, Ilene insisted.She placed her hand on the panel, and water began to pour out.I dont feel anything.All I can do is make it pour water.Maybe my clairvoyance allows me to read information from it.That must be one of the reasons they gave Drkp his tinfoil hat, Helena speculated.Are you saying you can use this thing?Ilene asked.Apparently.I dont think that I could input any commands or anything, but maybe I could find some useful information, Helena replied.She took a deep breath, and hesitantly placed her hand back on the panel.Marc and Drkp were led down the tall hallways of living flesh until they arrived at a dank room.They were placed into chairs growing from the floor, and secured by a substance like spiders silk about their wrists and ankles.Levanoch was seated (or at least the closest position a Scraumudi can come to sitting) across from them at a large desk resembling the shell of an ancient aquatic animal.The other two Scraumudi stood guard at the door.Captain Spencer, a pleasure to meet you in person, Levanoch greeted.And Elizien.Long have I dreamt of the day when you would again be my prisoner.I remember what your name means as well.Ardour of God, if Im not mistaken.But that is the name your own people gave you.From what Ive learned, the Humans, specifically those you took to dwell with you on your own world, have given you the name Drkp.I dont know what it means, and I dont care.But if it pleases you thats what I shall call you now.If I may interrupt, Marc said.How is it you can speak Hominese without a Rosetta Stone?Well I learned it of course.It saved me the hassle of running everything I downloaded from your panplexus through a translation matrix, Levanoch explained.Our syrinxes allow us to speak a wide range of languages.I find it hard to believe that youve been eavesdropping on our communications for centuries and weve never realized it, Marc said.Captain, your panplexus is a vast network of networks, interconnecting umptillions of computers.Its far too large to monitor.Our intermittently establishing a solitary uplink went quite unnoticed.Levanoch replied.And you use Newtonian physics to triangulate the source of quantum signals, as they are macroscopic objects.Since were only connected to the rest of the Universe on the quantum level our uplink is untraceable.Where is the rest of my crew?Marc asked.Levanoch was silent for a moment.Detained, he replied at last.I want to know where they are, Marc said.If you cooperate with me I may give you some information, Levanoch offered.I have a team of scientists and engineers aboard your vessel at the moment.Theyre running extensive scans and diagnostics of your ship and its systems, learning everything they can.Once theyve learned enough theyll attempt to inverse one of the wormholes.Well be able to achieve this much sooner, and with a much higher chance of success, if you will give us the information we need.I want to hear every last detail about your hyperluminal drive.I want to see my crew first, Marc insisted.I will not tolerate demands from you Captain, Levanoch said.I warn you, do not test my patience.My tolerance for insolence is scant.If I were you, I would try to keep me in a tolerant mood.I can give you no information, Marc said obstinately.I cannot share technology with hostile governments.Then I have a loophole for you; Im not doing this in the name of my government, Levanoch informed him.Marc and Drkp looked at each other bemused.Is that why you didnt send any other ships after us?Marc asked.I couldnt risk them discovering the power of your vessel, Levanoch explained.You see, once I free my people from this prison they will all swear loyalty to me, and then I shall murder our leader and take his place.It is because of his crimes that we suffer as we do, because of him that you are reluctant to help us.You fear that once we are free we will rapaciously plunder all the worlds in the heavens, leaving their inhabitants to destitution and famine.I assure you that under my rule the Scraumudi will be a nobler people.Yesterday, you threatened to torture and kill every member of my crew, then wipe out the Reticulans, Marc reminded him.I am a warrior, Captain.A warrior poet I would like to think, and we were on the brink of combat, Levanoch explained.At such times I am given to venomous words.I assure you it was merely psychological warfare and those words have no veracity to them.You mean to kill Nakhash?Drkp asked.Levanoch cocked his head in bemusement, not recognizing the Warlords name in another tongue.If that is your name for our incompetent incumbent, than yes, he replied.I intend to kill him, and I think Ill enjoy it.Then you must have a plan to preserve the Chrysalises?Drkp asked intrigued.Levanoch only scoffed.The Chrysalises will be quite unaffected by the long overdue execution of our dear tyrant, he claimed.Nakhash may have been able to deceive the plebeian rabble into believing that codswallop, but not me.I have absolutely no evidence to support Nakhashs claim that he is linked to the Chrysalises in any way, and that his death will mean the death of us all, except for his word.And that alone is reason enough to believe its a lie.In fact, I think I may even have been the one to suggest it to him.Its been so long, I cant recall.You are so certain that it is a lie youre willing to bet your life upon it?Drkp asked.Indeed I am.You Allurans had marvellous intelligence agents back during the Serpent War.Surely you must know that it is a lie?We were unable to ascertain whether or not that was true, Drkp replied.How very disappointing.But its of no consequence.All Scraumudi will know its a lie when they see me eviscerate him with his regal sceptre.Levanoch, I need to know what youve done with my crew!Marc insisted.Levanoch let out a reluctant sigh.You neednt worry yourself.Theyre fine for the moment.They have access to food, water, facilities.Ive even given them medical supplies, from your own sick bay, Levanoch told him.I have not been nearly as cruel as I might have been Captain.Aside from firearms, Ive allowed your crew to keep whatever positions they had on them at the time.I might have stripped them of all their effects and garments, chained them up, beaten them so severely theyd be unable to move, or drugged them into unconsciousness.No injuries or indignities have been inflicted upon your crew other than those that were necessary to bring them aboard, and that would not have been necessary if you had simply submitted to me.Drkp scoffed.Once you have what you need to escape you will dispose of us, he claimed.We are not so easily deceived.Captain, please.I saw you attempt to inverse a wormhole, and it almost worked!Levanoch said.On your first try you accomplished more than we have in nearly ten thousand years.Please, tell me what you did.If you help us to escape, your reward will be vast!Our Armada was once comprised of over a million battleships, and under my reign it shall swell to such numbers again!With such a force we could conquer any race, obtain unlimited amounts of wealth.These things and more we will share with you if only you will free us now and serve us forevermore.Marc couldnt help but smile at Levanochs vacuous attempt at bribery.Were a post scarcity society Levanoch.We already have unlimited wealth, Marc informed him.There are thousands of stars within the Pananthropic Republic, every one of which radiates trillions of terawatts of energy.Every solar system has octillions of tonnes of raw materials, and we can bend their individual atoms to our will to make whatever we desire.Were all rich, making money worthless to us.Its so worthless to us that we consider hoarding wealth a mental illness, making your offer insane.We cannot be bribed with something so primitive as material wealth.If youve been studying us for centuries, Id have thought you would know that.A fair point.I hope youll trust me then when I tell you what the penalty for disobedience is, Levanoch said.I have studied you for centuries, albeit from afar, and I do know a great deal about your people.You Humans no longer suffer as you did in the past.Youve boosted your baseline happiness, and re engineered yourselves to have pain asymbolia.You feel the sensation of pain, you understand what it signifies and that it is to be avoided, but you do not perceive it as being unpleasant.Its neutral to you.What you experience is mere nociception, and you have no shortage of euphoriants and anti nociceptives for when even that gets too much.Youre victory over suffering is so complete that your females still give live birth without so much as a wince; how disgustingly quaint.There are however small cults of you who do not believe that this is a good thing.They believe in Original Sin, that Human beings are intrinsically evil and thus deserve to suffer.They rewire their brains in order to feel pain.Ive been speaking with my neurosurgeons and they think can perform the procedure.They may want to experiment on a few of you to be sure theyve got it right, but theyll be able to make you feel agony.Do you even know that word?I imagine you would have read it in some of your more ancient texts, but youve never felt agony, have you Captain?I can make you feel agony.Or maybe it wont be you.Maybe it will be your friend Chika, or her daughter Sophie.They have their precious euphoriants right now, if you were worried.Theyve both spent most of their lives in a state of orgasmic bliss.I doubt theyd have much tolerance for real pain.I can make them experience agony worse than childbirth, worse than being burned alive, worse than anything your ancestors ever had to suffer through!You can go back to your cell now.You have one day to think about what I have said to you.This time tomorrow you will once again be brought before me, and if you will not give me the information I require, then all those you command will pay with their lives for your obstinacy.Levanoch gestured to his guards to take them away.They pulled them from their chairs and carried them back to their dungeon.The cell doors slid open and Marc and Drkp were thrown back in.The guard seemed to curse at them in his tongue before he shut the doors again.Marc!Helena cried, rushing to his side.Are you okay?What did he do to you?Nothing, nothing, Im fine, Marc replied.
