Arachnid reported.Oh God, hes firing something!Get the shields back up, now!Marc ordered frantically.As the Deity impudently spewed plasma into space, hundreds of small, spherical objects landed all over the hull.A beeping on Arachnids neurolette let her know somebody was trying to contact her.Arachnid here, she responded.Maam, this is the torpedo bay, said the voice.Some sort of pink goo just came pouring out of the torpedo tubes.Its solidifying.Its kind of like chewing gum.We cant fire anything.Holy shit, said Randi, who was sitting at the operations station in the back.Whatever it is its clogging up all our weapons ports, thrusters, field coils, everything!Were helpless!Son of a bitch!Arachnid cursed as she pounded her console.As before, Levanochs ship complacently straddled up from behind and came to a stop, hovering above them.But this time there was no offering of resistance from the Deity, no surprise attack or attempt at escape.Slowly and ominously, a colossal orifice opened above them.Hundreds of white tentacles came wiggling down.They firmly wrapped around the Deitys arms, drawing her up into the belly of the Bloodwyrm.A silent terror grew within the hearts of the bridge crew as they contemplated the horrific fate that awaited them.The orifice closed beneath them, and they were sealed within Levanochs womb like hangar.Though it was large, it was only slightly bigger than the Deity herself, making it a tight squeeze.Theyre extending an umbilical port.Damn it, Im useless here.I got to get to the airlock.Without bothering to ask permission, Arachnid grabbed her helmet and ran off of the bridge.Drkp, what the hell do we do!Marc demanded.The pink goo will take almost a full day to decay on its own, Drkp replied.If we can stop the Scraumudi from taking the ship, well have to declog the field coils and at least the aft thrusters before we can make another attempt at escape.And how do we stop the Scraumudi from taking the ship?Ilene asked.Im afraid it now falls to Arachnid and her security force to repel the boarding party, Drkp said grimly.Taking into account that no one aboard this ship, excluding myself, is really a soldier, my hopes are not high.***      When Arachnid arrived at the airlock, there were nearly forty other armed people there, as well as a flock of small jellybots.The people had flipped over benches and lockers for cover, while others stood in the adjacent hallways, and all had rifles trained on the airlock.Arachnid took the point position with a group in the hallway nearest the entrance.There were only two other members of the Civic Guard present, and it was obvious that the rest of the gunners were terrified.Most Humans lived a life of affluence and tranquility.Not only had they never known violence, but they had been engineered and conditioned against it.Some of them may not even have been capable of shooting a living thing, even in self defense.Arachnid doubted very much that they would be of any use in a fight.Many of them began screaming at the very first sign of movement on the other side of the airlock.They could hear the sound of a torch cutting through the outer hatch.Once the outer hatch was gone, they could hear the Scraumudi voices.They heard them cackling.Arachnid thought they sounded like goblins.She was startled when a white hot flame pierced though the top of the inner hatch.It would have had to have been as hot as a star to cut through the invictus door, and contained within a force field to avoid killing everything around it.Some people dropped their weapons and ran off screaming.The flame slowly moved around the circumference, until it came to the top again.Then the flame was extinguished, and the door fell to the ground, toppling like a coin.For exactly two seconds nothing happened.Then a Scraumudi came flying out of the airlock, screeching like a damned banshee.About half of the gunners opened fire upon him in synchronicity.Most of them missed, but he was hit.Several people leapt out of the way to avoid him.When he crashed, he slid into the wall, and started convulsing violently as the orbis blasts overwhelmed his nervous system.Without warning, a spread of blue bolts swept the room.Almost half the security force was taken out.They all collapsed to the floor and lay motionless.Arachnid couldnt tell if they were dead or merely incapacitated, but she could see no physical damage.Another Scraumudi stuck his head out of the airlock.He was swarmed upon by jellybots, paralyzed by their electric stingers.Everyone took cover from another spread of Scraumudi fire.More of the serpentine creatures began pouring out of the airlock, and their unconscious bodies began to pile up.But before they fell they often managed to swat down a jellybot or shoot down a Human.Soon too few of both were left to hold back the boarding party, and they began breaking through.Arachnid, having depleted her carbines magazine, threw the rifle to the floor and pulled out her sidearm.She shot one of the creatures in the side.He twisted around sharply and glared at her, hissing like a rattlesnake.He started to slowly slither towards her.She kept firing at him until she ran out of orbs, but he did not relent.He drew himself to his full height and began plunging at her, but she managed to dodge him.She took out her baton, and when he came down for another blow she stabbed him in his left eye.He wailed out in agony, but the other Scraumudi were making an odd kind of hissing sound.She thought it was laughter.She realized now the Scraumudi had formed a circle around her and her opponent, and appeared to be goading her on.She got back to her feet and braced for another attack.Her opponent had also regained his composure, though his eye was now squinted and twitching.He looked like a cobra ready to strike, and sure enough he lunged at her again, but she rolled away.The Scraumudi now sounded like they were laughing at him, but one of them handed him some sort of blunt and heavy object.He swung at her twice and missed, but the third time violently hit her on the side of her head, and she went spinning to the ground.She landed on her stomach, and though the helmet absorbed most of the impact, she was too dazed to get back up right away.Her assailant picked her up and put her on her knees, twisting her arm behind her back.The Scraumudi raised his club as if for a coup de grace, but was stopped by the voice of another Scraumudi who had just come through the airlock.It was Amarantos; First Lieutenant to Levanoch himself.It sounded to Arachnid like he was berating his troops, for they were now silent and looked very sheepish.Arachnid was carelessly thrown to the floor.When she looked up at Amarantos, he was pointing a long, bizarre looking rifle at her, and fired.When the blue discharge hit her, she felt as if her nervous system was being overloaded, she seemed to feel everything at once, and she lost consciousness.Amarantos gestured for his troops to move out.Upon the bridge the others watched as the Scraumudi boarding party now came unopposed through the airlock.Magnolia sat curled up by her console, weeping quietly in terror.Are they dead?Marc asked solemnly.The security force?No, theyll be fine, Drkp assured him.At low energy levels the discharge from their weapons overwhelms the nervous system, resulting in unconsciousness.Theres no lasting damage, and theyll start waking up in twenty minutes to a half hour.However, at higher energy levels the discharge disrupts the nuclear forces that hold atoms together, causing an object to disintegrate,  There are over a hundred Scraumudi on board now, and more are coming, Helena said.Most of them are heading to the Chapel, and others are heading to anywhere else there are people, including here.The rest are taking our unconscious crew back to their ship.So what the hell do we do now?Ilene demanded.Arachnid did prepare all of the jellybots for combat, as well as order the Cornucopias to manufacture them continuously.Perhaps we should deploy the rest of them, Drkp suggested.Marc gave him a solemn nod.Down below the Scraumudi were making their way through the Deitys halls, jostling with each other, crawling in a long dark line of two or three abreast.Amarantos held up his hand, ordering them to stop.Something was approaching.He could hear a strange humming noise.Faintly at first, but growing nearer.He was expecting something horrible to come around the corner, but to his surprise it was only a little floating robot.It didnt look very threatening.In fact, it was almost cute.Of course that meant nothing to Amarantos, who ordered his troops to open fire the instant he saw it.Since the jellybot didnt have a nervous system, the low energy discharge from their weapons had no effect on it.The jellybot came flying at Amarantos, who narrowly ducked out of the way.It wrapped its tentacles around the head of the Scraumudi behind him, and began shocking him with paralysing waves of electromagnetic energy.An entire flock of jellybots came soaring down the hall, all with the same intent as the first.Many of the Scraumudi tried to turn around and escape, but the sound of gunfire came from the other end.They knew they had been ambushed and began to panic.Amarantos however did not lose his wits, and threw a small EMP grenade into the centre of the flock.Many of them collapsed twitching, but the furthest from the pulse kept coming.Amarantos grabbed one of the bots by its tentacles and started ferociously swinging it, smashing the other jellybots around him.He picked up his rifle, turned it up to its highest setting, and started firing at the jellybots behind him.This time the discharge destroyed the bulk of their bodies, and the explosion sent the remains flying backwards.The other Scraumudi followed their commanders example, and soon the jellybots were defeated.Amarantos and his soldiers allowed themselves the luxury of a victory cry, and then continued their trek through the halls of the Deity.Though they remained vigilant against another wave of attack, it wasnt necessary.The Deitys supply of jellybots was finite, and the rest were destroyed in confrontations with Scraumudi elsewhere on the ship.Thats it.Theyre all destroyed, Helena informed the rest of the bridge crew.And the utility feed to the Cornucopias has been cut off by some of the Scraumudi, so we cant make anymore.How much damage did we do?Ilene asked.Looks like we incapacitated a grand total of around three dozen Scraumudi, but more keep coming on and theyre heading to rendezvous with the other boarding parties, Helena replied.Nine of them have reached deck one!Theyll be here in a couple of minutes!Kamadev, who had been absent, came running through the door with a rifle slung over his shoulder.He was also carrying a navy blue velvet rug.Finally.Ilene, seal the blast doors!Marc ordered.A set of heavy doors descended down to block the entrances.You got them?Aye sir, Kamadev replied.He unfurled the mat on the floor, revealing three Vorpal Swords.They were nearly indestructible katanas with impossibly sharp blades.A generator in the hilt sent ultrasonic vibrations along the length of the blade, causing it to vibrate so rapidly that it shone with an incandescent blue aura.An insulated hand guard protected the wielder from the heat of the blade.They were clearly fatal weapons, and therefore illegal.No Cornucopia would create such things.They had been made long ago by the ancient Necrotheists, who had saved Humanity from slavery and extinction at the hands of the abominable Transmogs.It was because of their historical value that Vorpal Swords were still permitted to exist.They were treasured relics from the barbaric past.Marc had spent a sizeable fortune in acquiring a collection of three of them.He was only permitted to own them because he had no history of violence and his forensic profile said that he was virtually incapable of it.But Vorpal Swords had been made to slay monsters, and it seemed mad to leave them idle when there were monsters about.With all due respect sir, are you sure about this?Kamadev asked.No matter what the Scraumudi might do to us, theyre still people.You cant kill them.They can resurrect themselves.If death isnt permanent, then its justifiable self defence, Marc claimed half heartedly.Ilene picked up a sword with considerably more enthusiasm.This is awesome.He never lets me play with these, she said smiling.These arent toys.You have to be very careful not to graze yourself, Marc told her.Do you even know how to use those?Drkp asked.Marc and I have played Necrotheists in a simsphere before, Ilene replied.I beat him every time.If thats the only qualification you need then I guess Ill take the third one, Helena said.All right, take the sword.But be careful, Marc said.He spoke the words be careful, as Humans always did, as if they were some sort of magic charm that would protect their beloveds from harm.Ilene turned to address Drkp.What about you?she asked.Drkp doesnt need a weapon.With his powers hes going to take down more Scraumudi than the rest of us combined, Helena informed her.There was a great thud at one of the doors.This is it, Ilene said nervously.Everyone stand away from the door, Drkp ordered.They turned to face the entrance while maintaining a safe distance from it.Im presuming you and Luthien there had some sort of maudlin shit in the conference room after we left, Ilene said.Magnolia shrieked as another violent thud made a depression in the door.Without taking her eyes off the doors, she tried to back away, but only tripped and fell backwards.Instead of getting up, she just laid there in a curled up position, weeping in terror.Kumar stood behind her so as to better shoot any attacking Scraumudi.Blades, focus, Marc ordered.I wish I had said something to Chika, or Sophie, she lamented.The door was rammed again.You didnt?Marc asked.Theyve both been blissed out since we got in here, she replied.Oh fuck Marc, what if, what if I never see them again?I mean Chika, shes, shes my, oh fuck!She lowered her sword and hung her head, trying to stop herself from crying.The Scraumudi continued to ram the door.Blades, listen to me.As one of your closest and dearest friends, I swear unto God that I will do everything in my power to make sure you see your family again, Marc vowed.But in order to do that you need to stay alive.I need you to defend yourself.Tell me you can do that.Ilene nodded, raised her head with a new ardour in her eyes, and held her sword at the ready, willing to slice through whatever came at her.Another thud, and the door was now bulging outwards, barely still attached to its frame.One more hit and it would be gone.Their Vorpal Swords shone with a faint but noble blue radiance and hummed softly.Though their defences had been overrun, and the Deity was immobilized and swarming with Scraumudi, they stood staunchly with their swords held high in anticipation of the attack.Though hope of retaking the ship was now dim, the Vorpal Swords in their hands reminded them of the maxim of the ancient Necrotheists.Resistance was never futile.With one final thud the door came flying towards Marc and the others.They quickly ducked out of its way.When they looked up a Scraumudi was pointing a rifle at them.When he fired Magnolia was the only one to be stunned, since the others were able to leap out of the way.Before the Scraumudi could hit anymore of them, Drkp telekinetically pulled the gun towards him, and snapped it in half.The Scraumudi hissed in rage, but before he could attack Ilene began hacking at him with her sword.The glowing blade made quick work of his exoskeleton, and within seconds the upper half of his torso and the rest of his body were separated and writhing on the floor.Ilene impaled the next Scraumudi who tried to come through, then decapitated him.Another Scraumudi came charging towards her and rammed her with his head, sending her flying back towards the others.Several Scraumudi were now able to make it onto the bridge.Kamadev began shooting at them, and quickly had them thrashing on the ground.Drkp pulled away the weapons from those left standing, then sent them flying back into the hallway, crashing into the rest of their troop.Another Scraumudi came lunging towards Drkp, too fast for Kamadev to shoot it.Drkp merely held up his hand and the worm halted in midair, floating in front of him.He squirmed in a futile effort to reach Drkp, but he tossed him back into the hallway.Drkp took a deep breath, and pointed the end of his stave towards the door.A bolt of astral lighting issued forth from the crystal orb and it passed through the bodies of the Scraumudi, immobilizing them.They howled in agony and glowed with a soft fuchsia aura.Ilene got back up, and instantly decided to take advantage of this opportunity and kill all of the Scraumudi while they were helpless.Ilene dont!Helena cried as she ran towards them, but it was of no avail.When Ilenes sword struck the Scraumudi a shockwave sent her flying backwards yet again, and an energy pulse of some kind traveled back along the lightning to Drkp.He was thrown high in the air and crashed against the far wall.When he hit the ground, he did not get back up.The Scraumudi quickly recovered, and started firing again.Helena dashed towards Drkp and picked up his fallen stave.Trembling, she held it towards the Scraumudi and attempted to use it.To her amazement, it actually started to glow very weakly.Small, intermittent bolts flew out towards the Scraumudi, and they shrieked briefly in pain, but it did not take long for one of them to get a clean shot at her, and she fell to the ground.Her shooter slithered towards her and looked down at her in wonder, oblivious to Marc.He swung his sword passionately at him, making a great wound in his side.Marc raised his sword for another blow, but despite his fervent need to save Helena from harm, he was just too well designed for compassion.The Scraumudis wails of pain generated sympathy in him, and he hesitated.Several other Scraumudi fired upon him simultaneously, and he dropped to the ground.Ilene sat back up, and saw that everyone else had been neutralized, and all of the Scraumudi were staring at her.Oh shit, she said.She grabbed her sword, and ducking their fire she ran off the bridge.One of the Scraumudi let out a war cry and pounced after her.In less than a minute Ilene was running across a catwalk that spanned an empty stairwell (which she had been told was the result of a design oversight).At the other end of the catwalk the doors slid open, and she skidded to a stop as she saw multiple Scraumudi there.She turned to run back, but the one that had been chasing her now blocked her path.You got to be kidding me, she said, as she realized she was now going to have to fight aliens over the Deitys pointless bottomless pit.The Scraumudi arched up as high as he could to tower over her, hissing ominously.Ilene swung at him, but he grabbed her wrist and dug his claws into it.Ilene dropped her sword and fell to her knees in pain.He released her from his grasp and stood proudly, gloating over how easily he had defeated her.In an instant, Ilene jumped back up and punched him in the face as hard as she could.His upper body snapped backwards.Grasping her sword with her good hand, she thrust it into the Scraumudis chest.As he cried out in pain, Ilene forced him over the handrail and down the empty stairwell.She turned to fight the Scraumudi behind her, but now that there was no longer any risk of hitting their comrade, they simply shot her.She was perhaps the last member of the crew to be neutralized.It was Amarantos who had taken her out, and now he looked down upon her inquisitively.I think this is their Second in Command, he said to his troops.Take her to the holding cell next to the Prison Bay.He looked at the scanning display on his rifle.Im reading four Humans, one Alluran and six Scraumudi up ahead, but no weapons fire.He inferred this must have been because Drkp and the Humans had been incapacitated.The ship is ours then.Ill go on ahead to get the Alluran.Before moving on, he glanced down into the bottomless pit, and for the immortal life of him couldnt imagine why someone would make such a thing.When he reached the bridge, he saw the Scraumudi huddled around Helena.Has the Alluran been given his crown?Yes Sire, the leader replied.Amarantos smiled sadistically as he saw that Drkp now bore a metallic band that reached around the back of his head and bore into his temples, which were dripping green blood.The crown, as they called it, severely dampened his psychic powers.Excellent, he hissed.Is one of these the Captain?Yes Sire, this one here, the leader said as he pointed to Marc.Good, we already have the XO.Take him and the Alluran to the holding cell, Amarantos ordered.Theres one more thing Sire, the lead Scraumudi said.He held up the stave.Do you know what this?Amarantos recoiled and hissed in revulsion.Yes.Its Alluran sorcery.No other race can use it.Well this Human here managed to use it, he said, pointing at Helena.What?Amarantos asked in disbelief.She picked it up, and it started glowing and then she started shooting at us, he replied.It wasnt nearly as bad as when the Alluran wielded it, but nonetheless she used it.As you can see Im holding it right now, and its not doing anything.It shouldnt be possible.Humans are only supposed to have negligible psionic abilities, Amarantos stated perplexed.We only have the one crown.Put her in the holding cell for now.Well figure out what to do with her later.The others bowed in obeisance, and carried out his command.The Scraumudi filed back aboard their vessel, each carrying at least two unconscious Humans with them.Not far from the air lock was the Prison Bay.It was really just a slightly modified cargo bay, but Levanoch believed it would be adequate.The bay was a hundred meters in diameter with a high domed ceiling, covered with rough red skin.It was dimly lit, and bore no furniture or decoration.The Scraumudi carelessly tossed the Humans on the floor, along with some medical supplies they raided from the Deitys sickbay so they could tend to their injuries.The captives were scanned and their weapons were confiscated, but other than that they were not violated.Levanoch wanted them to be as cooperative as possible.Once everybody had been taken off the Deity, the Scraumudi sealed and locked the brig, knowing their captives would awake momentarily.But Marc, Ilene, Helena and Drkp were taken to a much smaller holding cell, down the corridor from the Prison Bay.It was only several meters long and a couple of meters wide, but had at least been made was the actual intention of holding prisoners.It was also poorly lit, but it was covered in a dark blue skin.The Scraumudi shut them in there, and didnt bother to give them any sort of medicine.Levanoch folded his hands behind his back complacently as his commanders reported to him.The Deity was his, and her crew were his prisoners.Soon, very soon, he would be free from his starless abyss and have absolute dominion over all Scraumudi.He could almost smell Sapient flesh burning as his Armada rampaged across the Universe, purging it of all that threatened their eternal existence.It would be the dawning of a new cosmic era, an era where no conscious being other than the immortal Scraumudi would be permitted to exist.It would be an unending paradise.Four      One day passed, and the Deitys crew had not seen their captors again.Still confined to their small holding cell, Helena was examining Drkps psionic dampener (which they had termed a tin foil hat).She was attempting to find some way to deactivate it, as she had been doing on and off for the past twenty four hours.Ilene paced back and forth along the width of the cell, desperately yearning to know whether or not her family was alive.I thought your telepathic range was miles.Cant you tell whether or not theyre at least somewhere on this ship?she demanded.I cant even see outside this room right now, he said hoarsely.I have no idea where the rest of the crew is.Ilene, please dont make him talk.Its very difficult for him right now, Helena said.She pulled out her pocket scanner and started taking readings.I cant believe they didnt take that from you, Ilene commented.I know.
