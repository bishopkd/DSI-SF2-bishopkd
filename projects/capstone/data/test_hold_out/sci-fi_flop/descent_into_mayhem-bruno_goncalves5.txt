They had gotten a brutal working over in the sims yesterday, their Lieutenant having tweaked the feedback interface so that all quicker movements required an unusual amount of physical exertion to induce the simulator to respond.The exercise objective had been to discover how to moderate ones movements so as to reduce compressed air consumption.Smooth motion, extended range.That had been the maxim of the day.It had taken a while for them to get used to the change, but in the end it had been unavoidable, since it had been only a matter of time before their sapped limbs finally gave up fighting, slowing down to economize all by themselves.At the exercises terminus, they had each received a final report displaying the rate of compressed air consumption over elapsed mission time.Toni had performed terribly; hed been fighting his simul Suit like a maniac, and by the end of the affair his legs had been shaking like saplings in the great winds.That was nothing, however, compared to how he felt today.He had it worst in his abdominal muscles, which seemed to have contracted painfully in the aftermath of yesterdays training.He was following Gordies example, who had decided to lie on his back with a pillowcase underneath his thighs to reduce the muscular tension.At first it hadnt appeared to help at all, until he had tried removing and felt the pain sharpen as his abdominals tautened.Finally giving up, Toni contented himself instead with simply lying there, allowing his troubled mind to wander freely, as it was prone to do.The days following the April 21st attack on Leiben had been pregnant with barely suppressed panic in the Armed Forces, a state that MEWAC itself had managed to shy away from only due to the professionalism it still managed to retain.On the other hand, there was no euphoria, the primary reason being that, overshadowing their outrage due to the assault on their capital, was the stark realization that they were the ones who were supposed to do something about it.Baylen had aptly managed to put the mood into words.He reasoned that, had he been a civilian, he would have been outraged enough to join the forces and get even but, since he was already there and knew the full extent of what they might be in for, all that remained was to brood over their unknown enemy, and over what lay ahead.Toni discovered that he was completely unafraid, and wondered whether that said something very good about his mental state, or something very bad.He suspected that he probably had yet to fully understand the scope of the crisis before them.Adding to that, his mind had recently begun to feel warped out of shape, and he had since found himself overreacting to the ever more frequent frictions between the cadets.Perhaps it was the excessive doses of nootropic medication, or perhaps the suffocating pressure, or perhaps there was something fundamentally wrong with him, but Toni was no longer able to get through a day without entertaining thoughts of killing someone.Sometimes a person in particular would be a target of the notion, but mostly a dark part of him had begun to feel that killing every single biped in his immediate vicinity would somehow make the pressure go away.He kept the fantasies to himself, despite having briefly toyed with the possibility of telling Ray about it.The attack on Leiben had led Toni to make the first significant purchase of his life, his miserable current salary having been just enough to acquire a DigiSlab personal computer.Its performance was nothing to write home about, but at least he no longer needed to wait his turn at the Cadets Messe, as they called the computer filled compartment reserved for their platoon.He had also begun to tune into all local broadcast systems, be they video, audio or net.At least until the blanket ban had come into effect, cutting most base personnel off from the outside world.Now the entire planet could be on fire, and he would only know about it when the skyline was aflame.The ban had also denied him any prospect of reestablishing contact with his family.He sometimes wondered about the enemy.Local speculation currently ranged from aquatic aliens in fishbowl helmets to the exceptionally rancorous inhabitants from the Terminator hub (All gave Rakaia a wider berth once that theory became airborne).All that was certain was that Leiben had come under missile attack twice on the same day, each salvo having been launched with enough force to completely annihilate it if not for the citys defense grid.The few missiles that had managed to punch through devastated entire segments of the city.Not a whisper of enemy action had been picked up afterwards, although elements of the ASC had since begun reconnoitering eastern Thaumantias due to whisperings about lights in the sky and missing miners.Baylen had been pulled from the SIC last week, a personnel deficit in the FIC having apparently been discovered, and they were once again stuck with Ian as liaison between the instructors and their cadets.Morale had subsequently taken a nose dive.Ray hadnt been helping things either.His fathers life had been extinguished in the second strike and the cadets once entertaining tantrums had begun to take on a much nastier tone.His performance in the sims, however, had suffered dramatic improvement.Despite the brutal increase in the training load, the platoon was still only expected to graduate by the eve of September.The mid course break had unsurprisingly been cancelled, but there appeared to be no wish from the brass to commit cadets to a fight before they were fully qualified.Toni felt both relieved and annoyed by the decision, although Ray had been furious when the platoon was informed.He had since had a look in his eyes that kept most cadets clear of his path, although Toni still counted him as a friend and therefore listened patiently to the cadets vengeful monologues.Cadets, time to get up!Toni suddenly heard someone say.He turned his throbbing head slowly, feeling every muscle in his neck strain as he did so.An already uniformed Ian stood beside his bed as if expecting his comrades to leap up eagerly from theirs.A few well deployed blankets ensured that it was still quite dark, but Toni didnt need the light to know that Ians boots were already shining.Backside kissing fire stomper, he thought tiredly.He wondered whether he should inform medical of his persistent headaches.All cadets remained where they were.When Ian realized that no one was going to move in the predictable future he finally gave up, exiting the casern quietly without a backward glance.Toni suspected the special one was about to inform on them, but he couldnt have cared less; a day off was a day off in his book, and he was not alone in the thought.You guys thinking what Im thinking?Gordie croaked out loud.There were several answering grunts.If the Special One gives me grief today, Im gonna fuck him up.he declared throatily.About time, someone groaned.Make it count, someone else added supportively, and similar remarks made themselves heard over the following minutes.Choose the time and place carefully, mate ...was about all Toni could say.There were several agreeing grunts to the somewhat obvious suggestion.And just like that, Ian Templeton had once again been promoted to target status.There was no need for deep discussion among them; he had simply pissed off too many people too many times for a cadet to be willing to speak in his defense.Comforted by the prospect of justice, Toni found himself drifting towards sleep again.The lunch horn rudely woke him.He had managed to fall deeply asleep, and time must have flown by over the course of his slumber.Glancing at the wall clock, he found both hands pointing to the number twelve.Surprisingly, Toni didnt feel hungry in the least, and even Gordie complained that he could have waited another hour or two before stuffing his face.The shift officer might have something to say to that, however, and so all reluctantly left their beds, some complaining loudly over the assortment of injuries they possessed.There was little time.Within fifteen minutes the platoon would be expected to form up before the canteen, and so there was a hurried rush to the lavatories at the caserns opposite end, although not without the customary laughing and shoving that normally accompanied the trip.Thirteen brief minutes later, the platoons male elements exited their casern at a swift jog and coursed towards the canteen.Something struck Toni as quite odd as he ran; no other platoons or companies were formed up inside the bright yellow rectangle at the canteens entrance, where a single blonde cadet awaited their arrival.He also noticed that the few observable soldiers remained at their own caserns entrances, some clearly showing surprise as they observed the cadets progress.The inertia of habit causing them to continue, the platoon formed up hastily as a beefy shift officer and his sergeant at arms joined them from the canteens interior.Toni made no effort to remember their names.Well, well, just look at all those slumberous faces ...the captain remarked with a smirk.He then turned towards Ian.Cadet, why are there five holes in the ranks?The cadet stood at attention and answered.Sir, there are only three missing cadets, the others have walked, sir.I see, but where are  the captain began, but then something at the parades opposite side caught his eye.His hardening features gave Toni the feeling the officer had just caught sight of the missing cadets.Soldiers snorted and laughed as the three female cadets crossed the parade at a run.Each requested permission to join the ranks and hastily fell in, Rakaia occupying the empty space before Toni.As he waited for the storm to break, Toni glimpsed the sweaty outline of the Terminators neck and wondered briefly whether she had ever been kissed there.I patiently await the inadequate excuse for your tardiness.Please take your time, the captain declared, a sardonic smile tugging at the corners of his almost lipless mouth.Rakaia snapped to attention.Captain, sir.We, um, had pressing sanitation issues to take care of, sir, she answered, earning a quick grin from the officers stocky sidekick.The captain appeared unmoved by the explanation.I care not about the current state of your menstrual cycle, cadets!There is no justification for such a delay.This platoon is already well into its basic training and were still seeing day one fuckups here!I have been told your sergeant ordered you to get your rears out of bed over an hour ago.Isnt that correct?This is so far beyond disrespect, it borders on insubordination!the captain roared.A few silent moments passed by and the officer slowly regained his color, having apparently reached some sort of decision.Alright, so be it.Id been pondering a simple chewing out and dismissal, but it seems well be requiring more drastic correctives.This platoon will remain formed up until the lunch hour arrives.If in the meantime I happen to notice a single cadet twitch in formation, youll be spending the remainder of the afternoon in formation as well.That clear?he finished, flashing them with a vicious grin before about facing and returning to the canteens cool interior.There was silence as all digested what had just been said.Toni required no explanation; only Ian was permitted to carry a watch, and the caserns wall clocks were regulated by the shift officer from his office.He wondered idly what time it really was, and whether the stunt had been Ians idea or the captains.In truth, it did not matter who the mastermind was.As the volume of whispering began to swell, all eyes became fixed on the blonde cadet standing rigidly at ease before them.Ians expression hadnt changed over the last few minutes, but his eyes occasionally darted towards the cadets standing at ease before him.What he saw there probably didnt please him, and instead he began to stare long and hard into the void directly over their heads.The whispers died down after a while and the cadets settled in for the wait until the lunch horn, the sun slowly baking Tonis ebony cap until he began to feel light headed.He could usually bank on his unstoppable train of thought to entertain him in times like those, but today was a different matter.His body was in such discomfort that he couldnt focus on anything but the pain, nor could he manage to keep from staring at Ians pale throat and imagining his hands wrapped around it.After a while, base personnel began to loiter beneath the canteen buildings shadowy overhang, curious at the collection of cadets suffering under the blood red sun.Through his discomfort, Toni noticed that a few had huddled together and were talking excitedly amongst themselves, and he saw several credit notes passed between hands.Toni suddenly felt himself sway and quickly righted himself, and there was a sudden flurry of excitement among the huddle of nearby soldiers.That was all he needed to know what they were betting on.As the platoons discomfort began to peak, Toni once again heard dire mutterings from the cadets around him.Rays voice was particularly prolific among the renewed threats and insults being hissed at Ian.He remained quiet, however, preferring instead to focus his attention on the canteen door in case the captain were to make an unexpected appearance.Gordie was making a particularly nasty remark about Ians lineage when they heard a throat clearing noisily behind them.So this is how we treat each other when the brass isnt looking, huh?a familiar voice remarked.It seems we must inform the platoon commander that his lessons of unity are failing, mustnt we?The captain slowly stepped around the platoon from behind, his boots beating a slow and steady cadence against the concrete parade ground until he stood before them once more, smiling at their steadily reddening faces.Despite his embarrassment, Toni was quite impressed at the subterfuge.Impressed enough to take a brief glance at his nametag.ALBINO O  , it proudly declared.Captain Albino had probably left the canteens rear entrance and circled around unnoticed between the double rank of buildings that flanked the parade ground.The captain huffed indignantly, but didnt waste his time with another scolding.As soon as each cadet has had his meal, this platoon is to form up again.And it will remain in formation for the noon until it has become clear to me that you all understand the error of your ways.Are we clear?he demanded, waiting for an answer that was reluctant to come.I SAID ARE WE CLEAR?he bellowed.The answering affirmative was loud and angry.Good ...he breathed, and promptly exchanged their company for the relatively cool canteen.It was three quarters past infinity and Tonis feet were numb when the proper lunch horn finally sounded.There was a smattering of applause from the base personnel as they quickly formed up beside them, not to mention a few disappointed faces, perhaps because no member of Tonis platoon had managed to face plank into the parade ground.Serves the bastards right, he thought as the captain took his place before the soldiers to receive them.Lunch was a silent, tense and all too brief affair, and before they knew it the platoon was once again formed up on the ground for the remainder of the afternoon.The day loomed long before them.It was Toni who came up with the idea.The Sweet Laurinda marching song was one that all had become quite familiar with; the LT had made sure of that over the last few months.If the song was sung at its intended tempo, from its first O sweet Laurinda to its last bare your thighs once more, approximately two minutes would have passed by.The idea was simple enough, and was quietly agreed upon by all members of the platoon (sans Ian) as they stood in formation; when the end of lunch horn resounded, the cadet to the front and left side of the formation would sing the marching song in his head until the last verse, which would be sung under his breath, thus signaling the cadet beside him to take up the tune.Once the song had made a full circuit in the formed platoon, they would by then know that about twenty six minutes had elapsed, thus providing them with a reliable measuring stick of time.A quick calculation also made it clear that each cadet would have to sing the Sweet Laurinda eight times before they could reasonably expect dismissal.Toni had prepared for the afternoon in other ways, swiping several packets of sugar and stashing them in his breast pocket, and loosening his boots so as to provide more irrigation for his feet.It hadnt been enough.By his second Sweet Laurinda, Tonis toes were tingling.Bare your thighs once more ...Rakaia breathed tonelessly before him.The last verse had long ceased to have entertainment value, although Toni would still hear an occasional snort when one of the femmes sang it aloud.He began to carry the tune in his head for the third time, well aware that that meant over an hour had elapsed.As the song approached the part where the departing soldier was making indecent proposals to his fair neighbor, Rakaia began to sway dangerously.Knee to the ground, Tani, Toni whispered urgently before continuing the song in his head, finding it odd that she was showing fatigue after only one standing hour.Kaia, put your knee down!he heard Hannah whisper more forcefully from his left.As the tallest of the three femmes, she was situated in the same rank as Toni, allowing her to see the same thing he did.Silence in the ranks!Ian snapped.Shut it, ya peacock!Ray snapped back to the amusement of his comrades.There was a sudden intake of breath from Hannah and Toni barely had time to snatch a handful of Rakaias uniform; she had begun to swing forward in a classic planking maneuver.Instead she crumpled to the ground like an inanimate puppet.There was no need for drama.Hannah calmly broke rank to assist her prone comrade as Toni returned to his at ease position.He glanced expectantly at Ian, who didnt seem too thrilled at the turn of events but had returned to his quiet contemplation of the void above.Yo, master and commander.Why dont you make yourself useful and inform the brass about Tani?Toni finally demanded.Ian stood where he was for a full minute before reluctantly abandoning formation in search of the shift officer.The day was a whore, however, and it had only just begun to screw them.Hirum went down in the sixth Sweet Laurinda.It was an unexpected event, and there had been nothing to warn of it.Toni had been resting his eyelids, a most risky endeavor under the circumstances, when he heard a heavy thump.Had Hirum been any taller than he was, he would have been luckier.Being, however, of shorter constitution than even Rakaia, he had found himself in the first rank and with no one in front of him to break his fall.He performed a ten point face plank against the concrete ground, knocking himself out in the process.The unconscious cadet was carried away shortly afterwards by the shift orderlies, both of whom had been loitering nearby as if expecting another collapse.One of them whispered softly to Gordie before leaving with his new charge.Before a minute had passed, Hannah was whispering the news to Toni.Orderly said for us to stop being so damn proud and put a knee to the ground if were feeling sick.Otherwise they wont know theres something wrong until someone hits the concrete.Hes also saying that Rakaias anemic.What?Why?Toni asked, mystified as to how an illness had slipped through Medicals fingers.Hannah shook her head and faced forwards with a mysterious smile on her face, leaving Toni to ponder on the matter.He whispered the message to the cadet behind him, getting the same question asked in return.He shrugged his answer.They were well into their ninth Sweet Laurinda, and Toni had begun to suspect they were singing it too fast, when they were once again visited by the shift officer.The captain gave the platoon a hard look and then chewed their ears out for good measure, before promptly dismissing the cadets for the remainder of the day.Ian made it easy for Gordie by making his way directly back to the casern.He was followed by the entire platoon.Toni hurried to keep up beside Gordie who, despite being a first ranker in formation himself, was maintaining a respectful pace for one with such short legs.Gordie, you thinking about doing it now?he asked.Gordie didnt bother to reply.Yeah, Gordie, Gordie, lets take him out, yeah, Ray blustered on Gordies other side, smacking his fist into his palm like a prizefighter.Hes mine ...was all the answer they got from him.His tone was soft, but it brooked no argument.The last few meters were crossed in silence.Hannah and Sueli, in direct violation of base policy, entered the compartment along with the rest of them.The group found Ian standing beside his bed as if awaiting their arrival, and they remained at the entrance as Gordie approached their senior.Toni found it strange as he watched the pair speaking in low voices.Anyone unfamiliar with them would have been forgiven for believing that they were two friends in conversation, as outwardly pacific as the exchange appeared to be.Only Ians last remark, clearly audible to all those present, was enough to break the illusion.in any case you might want to remember what happened to your mates, right, chum?At the last word, Gordie bunched himself together with a snap and ploughed both fists into Ians torso, driving the cadet back with enough force to lift his feet off the ground and slam him into an open locker with a deafening clang.Hands hurried to close the compartment doors before anyone heard the ruckus.Gordies charge had managed to fit Ian neatly inside his own locker, with only his boots still sticking out.Gordie then began to rain right handed blows into the lockers interior, each shaking the metal structure more loudly than the one before.A boot suddenly connected with Gordies pelvis and he slid back a couple of meters over the polished floor.The locker was then tipped brusquely forwards, lifted up and then thrown towards him, clothes, books, snacks and a host of unidentified objects flying through the air.The locker collided against the muscle bound cadet with a thunderclap.Ian counterattacked, kicking his adversary viciously in his middle as the locker thundered into the floor beside them, and then he grabbed a hold of his adversarys head as it dipped low and began to repeatedly knee his torso, a mask of rage fixed on his bloodied face.He got as far as two knees before Gordie clamped onto his leg.With the same ease with which the aluminum locker had flown in one direction, Toni saw a cart wheeling Ian fly in the other to slam upright against the wall, the breath in his lungs being expelled with one explosive HUMPH!.Gordie wasnt far behind; he slammed the top of his skull against Ians face with a sickening thunk before, tearing a page from his adversarys book, he pulled Ians dolmen upwards and over his head and wrapped his head with the cloth.Gordie avenged Rays beating, slamming his own knee repeatedly against the dolmen covered head while holding it low.He got as far as three knees.In a blur of movement, Ian twisted himself around and shredded his uniform into flying tatters, before quickly opening ground to the very center of the compartment, his arms still wearing their sleeves as he took a fighting stance, his sinewy upper body now bare.Gordie nonchalantly discarded the olive green shreds in his hands and squared off with Ian.Then he rushed in like a charging bull.Ian spun in place and connected the heel of his boot against the top of Gordies head in a full blown spinning kick.Inertia conspired to close the distance between the fighters and Gordie slammed heavily into Ian.Regaining his balance with unnatural agility, Ian then let loose an unbelievingly fast combination of blows against his adversarys body and head.It quickly became clear the fight was over.Enough!Toni bellowed, but Ian only halted once the group had closed the distance, backing up against the wall as if in full expectation of a lynching.Leave him alone!Toni hollered as some made to move towards their senior.He wasnt alone in the thought, and others pulled at sleeves and dolmens to keep the more belligerent cadets away.Toni sat Gordie carefully upon one of the beds.His comrade wasnt bleeding much, nor had he fallen to the flurry, but his eyes were vacant and he was not answering questions.When Toni asked for the third time whether he was alright, Gordie vomited onto the pristine compartment floor, splattering a couple of beds along with Tonis boots.Wonderful, just wonderful!Ray wailed as he assessed his puke stained sheets.Ray, shut it!Toni barked.Somethings wrong with Gordie.Im gonna take him to the infirmary.See if you can clean up all the crap, alright?Ray, leave him alone, hes had enough, he added, since Ray had a look that suggested that he also wanted to try his luck with Ian.He has, has he?a quiet voice inquired from the compartments entrance.Lieutenant Templeton placidly observed the group from the doorway.It was the first time theyd ever seen him in civilian clothes, and he looked as smart as the devil himself.Black, neatly pressed suit, dentine white shirt and a honest to god black bow tie to top it all off.His ebony shoes squeaked as he shifted his lean weight about.And there I was in Leiben, attending my nephews baptismal, when I receive an odd message from the shift officer, cautioning me that my children are misbehaving on their day off, of all days.Who could have anticipated that?he speculated as he casually paced along the rooms extension, avoiding some underclothes and biscuits spread across the floor.And so I thought I would leave the matter until tomorrow.Until I received a second message saying my cadets were now threatening each other with bodily harm.And in formation, no less, he added pleasantly as he snapped his fingers before Gordies vacant eyes.Gordie didnt flinch, nor did he blink until a full second had passed by.The LT continued.So I decided to make a brief trip to MEWAC, the last place Id want to be on a Sunday, by the way, about as soon as the festivities were well underway, he looked up at a battered Ian, who was bleeding from his nose and several cuts on his brow, and who had taken up a posture that was somewhere between at ease and attention.And this is what I find ...he breathed.There was no expression in the lieutenants eyes.For a brief moment commander and cadet appeared very similar.Very well, then, he said, smiling once more, Mr.Toni and Mr.Raymond will take Mr.Gordon to the infirmary.Mr.Ian will take himself there as well.The two female cadets will remove themselves from these quarters immediately, in full knowledge that their violation of MEWAC regulations will not go unpunished.The remaining cadets will now begin cleaning their compartment until it is impeccable, and they can expect their quarters to be subject to inspection by shift personnel in the next thirty minutes.And I will be informing the shift officer and your Company commander of these events.I guess that covers everything, unless theres something else?he asked, as if honestly expecting someone to say yes.No?Very well then, on the move.I will see you all tomorrow.The lieutenant calmly strolled out without a backward glance.A couple of seconds passed by without anyone moving at all, but when they finally did, it was with an ever mounting sense of urgency.One cadet began to wipe a substantial amount of vomit from the floor with his personal hand towel.Bad choice, Toni thought, I would have gone for Ians towel.Its right there on the floor along with his other belongings.He and Ray removed Gordie from the casern and grimly set off for the infirmary, Ian already well ahead of them on the parade ground.What do you think theyll do to Gordie?Ray asked.Dont know, maybe theyll take pity on him ...Toni replied as he gazed at his mates defeated expression.*****      Its only a concussion ...the doctor muttered as he squinted at the display screen on his lap.A moment later he seemed to remember that he wasnt alone and turned to Toni.And just what in hell is wrong with you, cadet?he asked, peering curiously at the cadet.Nothing, sir.I just brought him in here, he replied in surprise.The doctor was a civilian, one of the many who worked in MEWAC, but Toni still felt obliged to sir him.He was a man in his late forties, with a deeply lined face that made him look somewhat older, and he had sad eyes.He probably wouldnt be around much longer, at least not in MEWAC.Over the last month, many civilians had been pulled from the unit, probably because nobody wanted any civvies lounging around the base in the event of a shooting war.One simply couldnt ask them to be running those kinds of risks, the brass had apparently said, although he had heard that many of the Stable boys were being kept due to their intimate knowledge of the Suit installations.Thats not what I mean, son, the doctor replied sourly.You are Cadet Toni Miura, are you not?Yes, sir.How did you know?Im psychic, he replied dead seriously.A twisted smile then began to play across his face.Or I just read your nametag.You know, the one pinned to your chest.That was enough to put an embarrassed smile on Tonis face, but it dissipated as the doctor became somber once more.What I mean is that Ive orders to harvest you for stem cells.Now why would they have me do that, boy?he pressed.Toni shrugged in reply.Havent a clue, sir.I was fully tested those weeks before day one, and the researchers seemed pretty satisfied.But if they want more blood, they can have it, no problem, he answered levelly enough, although his blood pressure began to drop at the thought of needles and blood loss.Son, they dont want blood.They want stem cells.Autologous stem cells, to be precise.Its not going to be as painless as, say, a needle prick, so youd better prepare yourself for some real pain.Youre going to lose some marrow, the doctor stated with a grim smile.Take your shirt off and sit over there, he ordered bluntly, waving carelessly at a metal cot as he began to remove instruments from a drawer.Uh, marrow?Toni inquired softly as blood drained from his face.The doctor looked irritated by Tonis lack of immediate compliance, but answered him anyway.Yes, boy.Marrow.Bone marrow.Sweet, juicy bone marrow for your Commanders evening soup.Now you go sit over there before I start telling everyone that youre a coward, the doctor threatened.The threat proved to be just enough to get Toni moving.*****      Thirty minutes later, a semi comatose Toni was rolled, color slowly returning to his ashen face, into the rearmost of the infirmarys two recovery rooms.Pathetic  the medic said under her breath, her expression akin to pity,  that a Suit driver could be so queer about needles.Toni tried to counter but his teeth were in his tongues way, and so he abstained from speaking.Instead he focused his attention on the ceiling, his head still spinning wildly.The medic tisked and finally made her way out of the room, leaving him to recover and think.While performing the horrendous deed, the doctor had inquired about what would lead Tonis family to believe he suffered from folic acid deficiency.Confronted with the cadets teeth clenched silence, the doctor had continued with his procedure and his monologue, explaining how MEWAC had received an urgent letter from a certain Kaya Miura, declaring the need for her brother to begin supplementation as soon as was possible.The doctor hadnt gone so far as to establish a direct connection between the letters contents and the present procedure, but there had been no need to.He reminded himself to thank Kaya appropriately for her sisterly consideration.You fell too?he heard from his right.Slowly turning his head, he found Rakaia lying on her side on a cot.She seemed to have regained some of her color, and her eyes had the look of not being too far from sleep.Nope.Doc just poked a needle in my spine.Were no longer in formation, he explained.Whats the noise outside?Gordies probably awake again.Must be making another try at Ian.Its been a hell of an afternoon ...Toni recounted the events to his comrade.Oh no!This is just what I need!she groaned.You werent even there, Kaia  he began.Who cares?!Rakaia interrupted hotly.Since when has not being there been any excuse to stay out of trouble?For the error of few, many must pay, right?!she recited before she realized what Toni was doing.Hey!she suddenly exclaimed....hum?Stop checking me out, you freak!As Toni had been teetering near sleep, his eyes had begun to roam over the curves of her body.He hastily snapped them back to her face.Oh ...sorry.Im just a little worn out, he apologized.So thats your default programming?As if you have a chance, gawker!Maybe it is, I guess ...he replied apologetically, trying to ignore the insult, but that doesnt mean I dont think well of you.I respect you, Kaia.Theres a lot of buzz on base about you guys, but I   What the hell do you mean by that?That ...that Leibens attackers were Terminators like you.That theres been a lot of unauthorized military development over there, which would be necessary for such an attack to even be possible.I dont believe any of that, of course, theres been too much focus on the iron mines ...he added, disliking the murderous expression that had begun to form on her face.Stay off my side, gawker!Ive had the entire base giving me the evil eye over the last month, but not even that has made me so desperate as to want you on my side!Her tone grated on his depleted nerves, her insults hitting harder than they ordinarily would have.He tried to hold on to his temper.I guess I didnt make myself understood.Just because I was being friendly doesnt mean I was trying to be your friend, Kaia.You Terminators sure dont seem to need any ...And just what the fuck do you fuckers know about the Terminator hub in the first place?!she shouted.Maybe we drink the blood of newborns, right?!Or maybe were born with horns on our foreheads, and need to have them surgically removed so that the decent, law abiding gawkers of the central government dont see our mark of the beast!Right?!And why the fuck are you calling me Kaia, huh?Are we buddies, maybe?Mates?Do you think youre going to make friends with me if you give me cute diminutives?Want to get in my pants?Do you, Gaw   I wouldnt dream of pulling the pants off a bleeding sow like you, Kaia!Toni heard himself say.Rakaia blinked.For all I know you were born with a horn in your ass, and needed to have it removed so youd be able to sit down and study like the rest of us.Thats the real reason you Terminators are illiterate, isnt it?And how the hell would you be able to take a crap without removing it?Not sure I even want to imagine that, KAIA!Rakaia made to answer, but then paused and stared closely at him.Whats wrong with   So you feel the eyes of the world on you?Do you, now?Well youre not imagining it.People on base dont trust you people, Kaia!I, at least, was willing to respect you.And I can still respect you, just as long as youre willing to show a little gratitude!Did I just say that?he thought in astonishment.He willed himself to shut up, and they stared silently at each other for a few moments.Finally, Toni let his breath out and slowly unwound, and before a minute had passed he was finally prepared to say the words.Im sorry, Tani.Its been a long day and I dont know what Im saying anymore.Whats wrong with you?she asked.The question hurt him deeply and he was not entirely able to hide it.He spoke without thinking.I like you, Kaia.I mean, I like you in a way I really shouldnt ...For a moment, Rakaias wide eyes remained fixed on his, unblinking, the tendons of her neck standing out in stark contrast to her soft throat.She seemed about to say something, but instead her body shivered as if a particularly unpleasant thought had just flashed across her mind.Finally she broke eye contact and sat up.Not if you were the last man on Thau.she hissed.A few moments passed by as Toni digested the statement.Apparently calm again, Rakaia politely addressed the wall.I think Im quite recovered.Im leaving now.Excuse me.She quietly left him sitting there.For a long while, Toni was simply too stunned to think.The first thought that did find its way into his consciousness, however, arrived in the form of a question.What in the hell is wrong with me?TEN      MEWAC medical bay, 19H15, 19th of May, 2771      The confrontation with Rakaia left Toni horrified.Not with her, of course; the Terminator had always rebuffed the cadets surrounding her, and he would never have expected anything less than the same for him.It wasnt what she had said that distressed him, but his free running mouth instead, and more specifically, the words it had uttered.Most especially, it was the feeling that had accompanied the words that were jilting his nerves.The feeling was not entirely unfamiliar.Over the course of his training, there had been moments when the pressure mounted alarmingly.In those times, a terrible thought sometimes crashed into the midst of his consciousness, yelling that he had finally reached his limit, and that it would all be so much easier if he simply gave up and took the Walk.At first he had simply ignored the thought and, more often than not, those moments were fleeting enough for the tactic to work.But then those critical moments had begun to stretch out, and simply ignoring the voice was no longer a practical option.It eventually became something to put up with, like Mason or the tics, any attempt to smother the voice only resulting in it squealing even louder in more desperate instances.It began to harass his spirit and slowly he had begun to hate the voice, and then that feeling had begun to make itself known.His memory tended to become hazy whenever that happened, and he would eventually return to himself afterwards in the shower, another critical training session having been accomplished without incident, his only memory of the session that feeling.A feeling as if he was no longer alone in his own mind, that there was another consciousness to be reckoned with, one which held grudges, which took revenge, which felt itself entitled to more than a fair measure of divine selfishness.There was no pity in it.That intrusive stranger would laugh whenever Toni agonized, and indeed he could hear it sniggering despite his present solitude.Closing his eyes, Toni focused on the emotion and sought to reach out and make contact with that hidden facet of his self.He let go of his self pity and felt himself approach the stranger.He abandoned his empathy, and closer he crept.He rose out of the trench that was his life and looked down upon it, observing the shoddy workmanship and the haphazard way it interconnected with those around him, and he sneered at it all.The feeling was becoming very strong.He accepted that he was of no worth.How tremendous it was, life.He had no value in the midst of it all.The myriad trenches surrounding him were better organized and kept, for the most part.They accommodated platoons, whole battalions, even, while his accommodated a young boy who didnt even know how to speak to members of the opposite gender.He sneered once more, his fangs showing.None of that mattered, of course.No matter how many virtuous lives needed to be snuffed out to validate his own insignificant existence, the deed would be done.No matter that his genes were defective, whether they be folic acid deficiencies or something more sinister, he would pass his genes onwards.He would engineer his way into the Terminators unworthy womb, even if he had to forcefully pry her lily white thighs   He began to tremble as the horrible imagery paraded before his minds eye, the stranger smirking slyly beside him.His emotional self began to tear itself apart, the horrified rejection of the delicious possibilities opposing itself to the epiphany of a draconian world view.A savage dogfight broke out in his mind, and his body began to shake and shudder.Turning his back towards the infirmary door, he smothered a scream and caved in to the overwhelming intensity of his emotions.At the peak of his anger, as his hate extended beyond himself and towards all the antagonists of his life, he sensed his moral skin slip away, feeling simultaneously terrified and delighted that it could so easily slide off if he allowed it to.He glimpsed the demon hidden beneath, and it proudly basked in the light of its discovery before once more hiding itself within the fabric of his mind.As the foul creature disappeared from Tonis consciousness, his weaker self tried desperately to hold on to some remnant of its power, but a moment later it was wholly gone except for that feeling, and for the reassuring knowledge that it was still concealed within.His shaking eventually subsided, and he began to lose track of time.The affliction had long departed when the infirmarys automatic blinds suddenly snapped shut, putting an abrupt end to Tonis dark thoughts.What time is it?he wondered.Slowly he rose, joints cracking loudly, and he crossed the room towards the entrance, unfastened boots squeaking over the varnished wooden floor.He found the medic at her desk reading, and she reluctantly turned her attention towards him as he approached.Well, finally up.You look flushed, cadet.Are you alright?she asked, concern lightly etching her pretty brow.Oh.Im just fine.What time is it?She pointed delicately to the wall clock above her head.It read nine oclock.Dinner time had come and gone quite a while ago.He had missed formation.The medic appeared to read his mind.Theres no need to worry, dear.The Commander passed by more than an hour ago.Told us it was alright to bring dinner to the injured in the infirmary.The ...Commander?Toni asked.Well, yes, of course.The entire base is out and about.Somethings up, but Im afraid I dont know what it is, so dont ask, she warned.The furrow of concern deepened.Listen, dear.I dont like how youre looking, nor did I like the strange noises you were making while you slept, so why dont you try resting a little more.Ill bring you your dinner just now, alright?she proposed with a sweet smile.Toni felt that her smile was disingenuous, but still felt obliged to comply.Presenting her with a smile of his own, he thanked her and returned to bed.As he lay down again, Toni realized he was still smiling, and quickly wiped it off his face.What had she meant by strange noises?Had he spoken out loud?He wondered what she must be thinking of him.And how had he not noticed the arrival of a full blown Colonel in the bay?He couldnt afford to lose his mind, not when the world was on the verge of becoming an interesting place.Toni made his way back to the casern a few minutes before the call to silence horn.What he found there caught him by surprise.The entire platoon had travel gear spread out on the beds, and was prepping Tier Three travel packs for locomotion.His own bed had one such T3 pack lying on it, but everyone appeared to be too busy to explain to him what to stow where, or why.Yo!Still in time to go back to Med Bay, Tonesy!Toni heard someone bray from further down the compartment.Rays arms were dug in up to their elbows in his larger back pack, and the Leibanese looked happier than Toni had seen him in a long while.He sauntered over to the busy cadet, hopeful for information.Mind telling me what the hell is going on?Are you ready to fight a war?Ray asked, giving him a wolfish grin.He then proceeded to explain.Apparently, the CDF has finally gotten wind of the enemys general location.Their defensive systems had proven so advanced that all unmanned aircraft in the vicinity had been incinerated.In fact, the weapons range was so extensive that the venerable Adamastor, Capicuas one time interstellar spaceship and sole remaining space station, had that very afternoon been knocked from its orbit as it passed overhead.All hands had been lost, elevating the body count since the conflicts beginning to more than four hundred dead.Oh, and the Enemys got an official name now.Well be calling them Unmil from now on.Unmil?How did they figure that?Ray looked at Toni carefully for the first time that day.You alright, man?You usually pick that crap up faster than me.Huh?Oh, yeah, I get it.Unknown Military, right?Toni ventured, trying to look as excited as his friend was.Rays preoccupation vanished at once and he proceeded to lay down facts more relevant to their immediate future.The brass, in their infinite wisdom, had proposed to the government that MEWACs entire ground force be committed to offensive action, aimed at striking a devastating blow against the Unmils before they got too well established.And somewhere along the line MEWACs entire ground force had come to include the Moca Suits, momentarily tasked to a certain platoon of eager, if rather malcontent, cadets.Hence the T3 packs.So you pack for extended operations, as per page one oh seven of the MEWAC Recruit Manual.Though they told us to pack it all very tightly, cause theyre gonna have us stow three days combat rations and a few extra Lacrau clips in there.Yo, master and commander!You got that pill for the Tones here?he bellowed suddenly at Ian, who had been methodically running a pen through a checklist.Apparently, the novel situation had put Ray in such high spirits that he had quite forgotten about his beef with the special one.Ian approached them quietly, taking a small capsule out of the breast pocket of his brand new dolmen as he did so.Toni accepted it reluctantly, deeply suspicious of anything Ian would offer him to swallow.Its a sleeping pill ...Ian explained neutrally.They want us to take one at the call to silence horn.He returned to his list without another word.Yeah, thats right!We gotta take it at the call too shilence hawn!But youd better put a hold on that until you got everything packed.Help me out, and then Ill give you a hand, arright?Rays enthusiasm proved infectious, and soon Toni found himself forgetting about what happened at the infirmary as they set to work.By eleven oclock, even Tonis backpack was neatly stowed, Ray having already gotten good practice sorting his and Gordies out, and by then both had decided to swallow their little ivory colored pills.The drug appeared to have no effect on their disposition, making them wonder after a while whether theyd been given a placebo.As the remainder of their fellow cadets slept like the dead, the two friends clasped hands aggressively.With not the least care for any lurking sergeants or officers, they slapped each others faces, laughing and promising one another that they would cut a fair length of Unmil throat before the campaigns end.As Toni finally lay down in his bed, a genuine smile spread across his face as he wallowed in his good mood, he peered around at the remaining members of his platoon, wondering idly whether any would die over the following weeks.They certainly looked dead at the moment, not a single one stirring except for Ray, who was rolling under the bed sheets as awake as he was.Sleep fell on him like a thief, stealing from him the memory of any dreams he might have had.Dawn proved to be a particularly windy one, and it was the music the gusts made against the caserns exterior that woke him.He hid his head under his pillow, trying hard to shut out the sound, made worse by the loud conversations taking place all around him.His shoulder was shaken twice before he found the resolve to look around.Gordie was once more among them.As the cadet laughed with his mates, ecstatic to be among his own again, Toni noticed only some puffiness around his eyes.Other than that he was no worse for wear.The wall clock read four oclock in the morning.Yet another shove on his shoulder finally got him onto his feet.Moving like a drunk, he uniformed himself, not caring to wash.Hed do that after the morning run.Then he remembered there would be no morning run.Sergeant Mason stomped into the compartment, and Toni discovered what his face looked like without its characteristic smirk.It seemed to be carved from stone.The platoon stood immediately at attention beside the beds.At ease, cadets, he began, dispensing with his usual game of stare and intimidation.Ill say this now, cause this is the last chance Ill get to say it.Im dead sure none of you are ready for this.Not a one!None of you should have been pulled from your training for this!he growled.The cadets watched their sergeant silently, none daring to agree, disagree or state any otherwise opinion.In fifteen minutes you will all form up before the company building for a briefing by our Company Commander.You will leave your equipment inside your casern.After a short briefing you will be distributed PDWs and corresponding ammunition, an anti trauma suit and helmet, three combat rations, one box of combat nootropics and one pair of binoculars.None of what Ive referred to is to be stowed in the Moca Suit.Instead it will be worn on your person or stashed inside your T packs.No exceptions!There is one last thing I need to say before formation, he added after a short pause.He observed them one at a time, and for once he had no sneer reserved for Toni.Whats going to happen can end a million different ways, but theres only two ways this will end quickly.Either the Unmils are a bunch of pussies, and well sweep the Cap free of them in a day, or they will be far superior to us on every level, and theyll defeat us decisively.In my view, and considering we dont have a clue as to the technology gap between both forces, the first battle may well result in one of these two scenarios.Considering this, Id like to offer you all maybe the best advice youll ever get from a soldier in this army.No matter what the brass tells you on that parade today, if you come into contact with the enemy, and theyre plowing through us like theyre fixing to sow the field, then forget about attacking, exacting revenge, or any other foolish idea that jumps into those juvenile minds of yours.Youre not gonna turn the battle around with obsolete equipment and incomplete training!Remember the following three Rs: Retreat, regroup and retire!A battleground is no place for cadets!We understood?he barked, his neck muscles taut as he waited for their answer.There were several reluctant yessirs and a few nods around the room.Toni didnt say a word; he was too busy marveling at the change of demeanor.Dont make us wait!he finally barked, about facing snappily before he left the room.Pussy ...Toni heard someone, probably Ray, breathe to his left.The preparations for formation began to accelerate.The male cadets formed up a full minute before the expected time, and for once the femmes did not let them down, arriving only moments later at a brisk run.Toni searched Rakaias features as she formed up in front of him, hopeful that she hadnt spoken to anyone about their exchange.She gave him a look of pure venom before presenting him with her back.Not the most encouraging sign, he thought sourly.He glanced to his left, only to find Hannah peering back at him with an indecipherable expression.He raised his eyebrows pleadingly, hoping shed recognize a wordless apology if she saw one.Eyes front, Ian ordered in a low voice.Cadet, direct the platoon to the briefing room, the LT called from behind.Ian barked out a collection of orders and the platoon obeyed reflexively, forming quickly into a double column before marching towards the caserns briefing room.Before entering, they were overtaken by the lieutenant, Mason, and a troop of sergeants and corporals.The corpies were carrying electronic equipment, and the sergeants several large scrolls.The fourteen cadets silently took their seats, Lieutenant Templeton having waived formalities beforehand.Good morning, cadets, the lieutenant began.So, before you all melt into the ground in sheer terror, Id like to make the following quite clear: you will not be expected to directly engage the enemy.He paused for a moment, silently observing as a kaleidoscope of emotions played across his subordinates faces.What he saw there must have been amusing, for a wry smile began to spread across his narrow face.However much that might disappoint some of you.The current situation also seems to have gifted to the more troublesome members of this flock with a reprieve; any disciplinary proceedings regarding what happened yesterday have, at least for the time being, been suspended.I would, however, like to make something clear.A declaration of war is in effect and, in case youre not aware of what that means, the SICs 1st platoon is forthwith an operational combat unit.As a direct result, any failure to comply with orders, as well as the committing of any other essentially military crime, will be dealt with severely.And when I say severely, I mean the firing squad.Taking this into consideration, and also considering that you are not expected to directly deal with the Unmils, you should be much more afraid of your own screw ups than of enemy action.And so I expect you to listen to this briefing with great care, because I dont think that the my mind was somewhere else excuse is going to work in a court martial.Corporals, if youll please set up the holographics ...That took all of thirty seconds.As the corporals set up the display equipment, Toni took a good look at the strangers before him.There were the three corporals, certainly close ground support.The footies usually had a beefy look to them.The sergeants, however, were something else entirely.Young, thin, wiry, and lazy eyes born of self confidence, they were beyond a doubt members of the ASC.And all three were distinctly displeased at their assignment.It was the disgusted look they were throwing the cadets that gave it away.Very well, thank you.I think before we get into the details of our current assignment, Id like to outline the change in status.By order of our Commander, Colonel Masters, all training and the SIC itself are suspended until the end of the Wild Rose Campaign.Our former 1st platoon is now the Logistics Support Platoon, aka LOGIS which, due to obvious considerations, will be dedicated to second line duties.This platoon has been divided into three sections, consisting of the following: In the 1st Section, under 2nd Sergeant Dim Dunn, we have Cadets Miura, Kimble, de Venter, Bowker and Grimm.In the 2nd Section, under 2nd Sergeant John Revone, we have Cadets Allerton, Cato, Tani, Winters and Yamato.And in the 3rd Section, under 2nd Sergeant Carl Jordan, we have Cadets Cassel, Arakaki, Rosa and Templeton.Once this briefing is over, these cadets are to join their respective section commanders.There was no need to ask who his section leader was; every time the LT had called out a sergeants name, one of them had stood at attention.His own leader was the pissed off looking oriental who, incidentally, didnt look dim in the slightest.He got the impression that his new leader was the most displeased of the lot.Alright, moving along ...the lieutenant continued.LOGIS is now an independent platoon under the MEWAC Task Force and our mission is a complicated one, so listen good: Firstly, to progress along with the main force as a reserve subunit, carrying excess ordnance and fuel for the Combat Suits moving ahead.Secondly, to execute flank reconnaissance when required, and only by explicit order from the Task Forces Commander, Lieutenant colonel Kokubo.This is due to the Moca Suits only advantage over the Hammerhead: it has almost twice the range.Thirdly, upon first contact with Unmil, one section will support our Combat Suits by supplying ordnance whenever and wherever necessary, while the remainder will assist foot infantry units in the creation of improvised fortifications along our TFs probable axis of retreat, said fortification remaining under the protection of these sections until relief by the first retreating subunit of Combat Suits.Not that well be expecting any order to withdraw.After all, Lieutenant colonel Kokubo is not the kind of leader who would make such a decision lightly.I hope you noticed my reference to the term Combat Suits.In case there are still any doubts, Ill make this crystal clear: The Suits in our subunit do NOT qualify as such, and so I expect you all to refrain from sticking your noses into the fight, if there is one.If any of you disobey this order, Ill remote detonate your Suit.That is a promise.Are we clear?It was all apparently very clear to all present, and Toni had no doubt that the LT could do exactly what he had just threatened to do.He was, however, a little miffed for never having been told that such a contingency existed, although when he thought better of it, such a measure actually made sense.After all, if one of them were to commit to battle, the remainder of the section would probably feel compelled to at least back him up.Even if the entire section wasnt wiped out as a result, it would still become bogged down in an unnecessary fight and leave their mission unaccomplished.The lieutenant took that sort of mathematics very seriously.The LT then began to expand upon the details of their mission, going through a blow by blow of what had to be done, by whom, and under what circumstances.As time began to stretch out, Toni was forced to fiercely discipline his mind so as to keep his attention firmly fixed on the briefing.His efforts were well rewarded when the LT quizzed them on the mission plan and Task Force organics.No one failed to correctly answer his questions.The last thing their platoon commander did before dismissing them was to order them to download all details of the mission from the GMN.Shortly after dismissal, Toni found himself in a corner of the classroom along with the rest of 1st section, watching silently as the SecLeaders conferred with their lieutenant in hushed voices.He peered at his surrounding comrades and a knot began to form in the pit of his stomach.Ray wasnt there.Nor was Gordie, nor any of the femmes.Hirum was there, although his presence didnt boost Tonis confidence in the least; Hirum was a decent friend, but his sim scores were well on the lower end of the performance spectrum.The remaining members were more comrades than mates, and only Clive Bowker, whose bed was beside his, was a closer acquaintance.The tall cadets natural reserve, however, had kept them from being anything more than that.Don Kimble, on the other hand, suffered from a bad case of androgyny.His skin was soft and rosy, he possessed no facial hair to speak of, and he was handsome in an almost feminine way.Toni suspected exogenous genes at play.The cadet also got along quite well with the femmes, which only served to ensure that he be kept at arms length from the platoons male members.Jim Grimm was officially an OK guy.He hung out with Shinji Yamato and Daryl Cato, and together they formed their own little special interest group.The corn haired cadet happened to be a hardcore programmer, thus adding his expertise to what they referred to as the Terrorbyte Crew.They constituted their own nation, but diplomatic relations with the remainder of the platoon had always been friendly.Toni was glad for Jims inclusion in the 1st section; they were currently rivals in the race to the summit of the performance spectrum.Toni?Hirum inquired hesitantly.What?he replied, still focused on his thoughts.What happened between you and Tani?Why would you think theres something between us?he answered, thinking it wise to answer the question with another.Don sniggered and answered in Hirums stead.Shes been looking at you like you shot her dog, man.Look at her.Toni turned towards the 2nd section and, sure enough, Rakaia stood there watching him like a hawk, her irises half hidden by her eyelids.Toni turned away, his face tightly expressionless.No need to be the good guy, he told himself.Turning to Hirum, he finally answered.I only presented her with a few unpleasant facts, thats all.She took it a little worse than I expected.Don thought on the answer for a moment, and then fixed Toni with a cold look.Rakaia doesnt need someone like you to tell her the facts, she knows them for herself already.She escaped some domestic issues back at the Terminator Hub.Shes had some real problems, unlike you, and it just wouldnt be a good idea to poke her like I expect you did.Especially not since shes about to be handed a four ton piece of military equipment to play with.And a live Lacrau.And a twenty five millimeter cannon.What do you think?Toni nodded weakly, figuring hed only make a bigger fool of himself if he opened his mouth again.First section!Form up on me!Sergeant Dunn suddenly barked.The powwow was over and their secleader stood at the doorway with two fingers above his head.The five cadets formed a double column before him and then they were off at a quick march.The entire base was unrecognizable in its new level of activity.The caserns had disgorged more foot soldiers than he had ever thought existed, and many were already formed up beside their impossibly large T4 travel packs on the parade ground.The packs presently rested at their owners feet, the personnel having yet to requisition their exoskeletons from the 3rd War Materials Deposit.Over the course of the following hour, time became a blur of confusion as all the promised equipment was requisitioned and distributed.Toni had to hand it to his new secleader; none of the WMD grunts gave the sergeant any hassle, his threatening demeanor proving to be a most efficient lubricant against the customary bureaucracy.Still, some of the clerks parted with their equipment reluctantly, as if their loss was a personal one.Before long the requisitioned material found itself before each drivers feet, the platoon forming a U on the parade ground as nearby footmen clad in combat exoskeletons clomped towards their destinations.Had he not seen the array of armament and equipment being fielded by the footmen, Toni would have believed that Kokubo intended them to fight on foot as well.He checked his gear.One Lacrau rifle with 180 rounds of eight millimeter caseless ammunition in four magazines.One Hornet TF 33 sidearm with 80 rounds of six millimeter caseless ammunition in four clips.A light duty ballistic helmet.One light duty ballistic vest, including sternum and dorsal anti trauma plates.Frag resistant combat fatigues, including integrated tourniquets at the nub of each extremity.A travel pack containing three combat rations (each providing a days worth of nourishment), a collapsible thermal oven and a first aid kit including enough combat nootropics to fight for three days without pause.One MFES Mark 4 Comm device, apparently only for emergencies.And one sleeping bag, which also served as a one man tent or raincoat, depending on need or imagination.It all totaled twenty two kilo mass of equipment which, allowing for the local gravity, culminated in more than thirty kilo weight to be carried.That number did not include some of the other goods theyd have to carry in their T3 travel packs.Why cant we get one of those?someone pointed to the exoskeletons nearby.Cause then you wouldnt be able to interface with the Moca, you idiot, sergeant Dunn replied dryly.Couldnt they get one of those combat suits to interface with the Moca instead of the HINT?Toni wondered out loud.The question drew a short pause from the sergeant.Dont be ridiculous, he finally huffed, ordering them instead to shoulder their equipment and return to the casern for the rest of their gear.It took the better part of an hour to take care of breakfast, and before long the platoon was joining the traffic jam of overburdened soldiers awaiting transport to the stables.As he laid his eyes on the mass of combat ready men converging upon the shuttle pick up point, Toni began to feel giddy with the unreality of it all.There were at least three different types of exoskeletons to be seen, or at least three different configurations of the same suit.Heavy weaponry, including anti armor missile launchers and entire base plate and tube mortar assemblies were shouldered nonchalantly, their carriers possessing the wired expressions of those under the effect of performance enhancers.The level of hyperactivity amongst the soldiery far exceeded their commanders abilities to quiet them, and so the volume of conversation slowly escalated as each bus arrived and then departed, followed by the vocal cursing of those left behind.Some officers began to warn their men against popping combat pills for the buzz.There were others, however, who seemed to have nothing to say.Some of the soldiers stood very still, while others kept searching the skies as if anticipating a raid.Suddenly not feeling so well, Toni stared down over the curve of his frontal pack and into the well trodden dirt beneath his feet, only to discover that someone had already beaten him to the punch; he was treading what was left of someones partly digested meal.He prayed for the next shuttle to arrive, if only so he could leave the unsightly mess behind.Before long, he began to feel his jaw tighten, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he did the same.Feeling a sudden slap on his shoulder, he turned to find Sergeant Dunn leaning towards him.Take it easy.Whats your name, kid?Tuh ...Toni.Well, listen here, Toni.A soldiers life is ninety nine percent waiting and one percent combat.The trick here is not to let the waiting part ruin you for the rest, alright?Find your zen, he added with a smile, giving him another slap on the shoulder before moving on.Toni thanked him silently as he left, feeling ashamed for having nearly fallen apart when so many were laughing and jeering around him.Time began to stretch out, and Toni eventually found his zen.It consisted mainly of not thinking too much, or looking at his watch, or counting the number of shuttles that had already departed, or trying to pay attention to the conversations around him.They have nothing interesting to say anyway, he thought from deep within his anesthetized mind.Their shuttle eventually did arrive, an old bus with the appearance of having very recently participated in a bumper car rally.It stunk of sweat and, by the time it began to move, every window had been opened, buffeting his platoon and the better part of another with some welcome fresh air.The journey woke him up a bit, but he kept his peace for a while longer, observing silently as the forest glided by.Far from being stopped at the usual checkpoints, the shuttle plowed straight through, entering the mountain directly from a discreet side door to stop beside the warehouse district.The immediate area had fallen into confusion, a scuffle having broken out moments before between footmen and local technicians, the footies commander having been forced to shut down his entire platoons exoskeletons before they killed anyone.More than thirty men suddenly fell to the ground in unison under the weight of their packs, the invisible troupe of puppeteers pulling their strings having apparently decided to take a coffee break.Better that than remote detonation, Toni thought.As quickly as could be managed, LOGIS was directed towards Stable 3, where a frazzled looking Ruka awaited them impatiently.Listen up good, cause Im only going to say this once, the sergeant began.Inside each Mocas cavity you will find a stowage compartment directly to the HINTs left.The first to try and squeeze his back pack in there will get a kick in the head.Your Lacrau and sidearm are to be kept there in their respective holsters.All other equipment will have to be stowed against the cavity walls using the straps present there.It is vital you strap it all down well, otherwise you might have your pack sliding into your legs in full locomotion.Which is a pretty stupid way to get yourselves killed or put out of action, by the way ...she added.Aside from that, strapping into your HINT is no different from the simulators, except youll have to insert your pen key into its slot directly before the interface first, otherwise its a no go.Each interface has already been adjusted for your specific biometry, so make sure to enter your unit in order of seniority; the eldest takes Unit One, number two takes Unit Two and so on.Any questions?A timid soul raised her hand.What is it, Sueli?Ruka asked irritably.The sergeant appeared to remember the cadet.Will we get a chance to go before we go, Sergeant?she asked apologetically.What?Oh, for the love of ...Lieutenant, your steeds need to make water, so please see to it.I need them strapped into their units within ten mikes or its my hide, understood?Nine minutes later Toni was easing into his hydraulic interface with care, his sense of peace having collapsed entirely.Toni was upset, partly due to his failed attempt to apologize to Rakaia after the bathroom break, which had resulted in her sweetly cautioning him to watch out for friendly fire incidents.However, for the most part he was upset due to Unit Sevens present condition.As he had been about to enter his unit, Ruka had approached him with a somewhat apologetic look on her face.Miura, may I have a word?Yes, maam.
