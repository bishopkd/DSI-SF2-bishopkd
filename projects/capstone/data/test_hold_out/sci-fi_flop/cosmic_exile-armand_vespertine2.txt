a man shouted as Marc disembarked from the shuttle.He was a tall athletic man with dark brown skin dressed in a golden shendyt that came down to just above his knees.He had golden eyes, his short hair was dyed gold, and he had bioluminescent gold tattoos on his arms and torso.He had an attractive girl on either side of him, and Marc guessed the three of them were paramours since both girls had similar patterns of glowing tattoos.Captain Spencer, hi.Im Randi Lykos, the Technician Foreman, he introduced himself as he shook Marcs wrist.He was a member of a largely unnecessary class of people who performed regular diagnostics, maintenance and repairs on the automated infrastructure that Humanity depended on.Even though the automated infrastructure was self sufficient, the existence of a token working class provided the (perhaps illusory) sense that Human beings werent hopelessly dependent on machines.I remember.I interviewed you, Marc replied.I know, but I figured you must have interviewed so many people that you wouldnt have remembered me, Randi explained.But thank you for choosing me sir.Ive never worked on a Starship before.None of us have.Its an honour.Marc turned his attention to the girl standing to Randis left.She looked like she just walked in off the beach.She was dressed only a purple gossamer sarong around her waist, and she was tanned like that was the most she had worn in her life.She had spiraling patterns of bioluminescent purple tattoos all along her body.Her eyes were lavender, and she wore her lavender hair Godiva style in a token display of modesty.Whos the purple girl?Helena asked.Im Sook yin Ming.Im the chief medic, she replied, smiling and curtseying.It sounds important, but I just tell the autodocs what to do and then hand out lollipops.She held out an assortment of swirled lollipops for them to take.Do those have euphoriants in them?Sophie asked.Of course, Sook yin replied.Awesome, thanks, Sophie said, eagerly accepting the drugged candy.Ill pass, thank you, Marc politely declined.The girl standing on Randis other side was easily recognized as a member of the Anthropic Civic Guard.They served the role of both police and foot soldiers, for times when AIs and telepresence were either undesired or infeasible.They were entirely female, as men were considered too easily corrupted by violence and were thus barred for any position that would require it.Even so, the majority of women who attempted to become a Civic Guard failed to meet the strict psychological and physical requirements.Civic Guards were not only the product of intense training and conditioning, but of somatic biomodifications.They were the superhumans among a race of superhumans.The girls toned muscles had been augmented with synthetic polymers, enhancing her strength.Despite her low body fat, she could function for many days without food, or even sleep.Her designer kidneys made it possible for her to survive prolonged periods without water.She had endless stamina, and the respirocytes in her blood allowed her to hold her breath for hours.She could run at nearly fifty kilometers an hour, and her agility and reflexes were equally astounding.Her bones had been transfigured into a nearly unbreakable substance.She had a tapetum lucidum, making her blue eyes shine in the dark.Her pupils were thus unusually small in the brightly lit hangar.Her visual spectrum went into the ultraviolet, and she could also see magnetic fields.Her other senses were similarly enhanced.She was capable of remaining dead calm in a life threatening scenario, and more importantly had been conditioned to be utterly obedient to her commanding officers.Above all else, the Civic Guards were loyal to Humanity and the Pananthropic Republic.This Civic Guard had bronze skin and raven black hair.It was cheek length in the front, and sloped downwards so that is was shoulder length in the back.She wore a nearly sleeveless haubergeon of invictus chainmail, and a pair of electronic vambraces.Her bare arms and legs had bright blue bioluminescent tattoos.In her belt she carried multiple weapons, none of them lethal.Not even the Civic Guards were permitted to carry lethal weapons.On her right side was an orbis pistol which shot lucent orbs that exploded on contact with a solid object.The consequent shockwave would knock a person off their feet and cause temporary paralysis.On her left she carried a lucent baton with a black handle.The baton caused temporary paralysis when applied to a Human body, and worked through most kinds of clothing.She also had a small pouch of incapacitating micro grenades.You must be Arachnid, Marc assumed, shaking her wrist.Yes sir, Arachnid replied proudly.On behalf of my squad I would like to swear to you that we will safeguard the lives of everyone aboard this ship from any and all alien threats.We will also provide any constabulary services that may be required.We will be conducting training drills each and every day to ensure we are prepared for all possible incidents.I appreciate the effort commander, but we are heading into Astra Incognita, Marc said.Dont be too surprised if your definition of all possible incidents is proven inadequate.Arachnid smiled and gave a single nod.Unless there are any issues that any of you would like to discuss with me, well be heading for our cabin now, Marc said, allowing Helena to hop on his back.By all means sir.It was great seeing you again, Randi said, with the girls making similar comments.The corridors of the Deity were lined with holographic windows displaying beautiful vistas and illuminating the halls with daylight.They reached Ilenes cabin first, and Marc decided to come in just to make sure everything was all right.Lying on an opulent roman couch was Ilenes wife and Sophies biological mother Chika.She had golden brown skin and eyes, and a mane of lavish black hair.She took no notice of them.She had a look of pure bliss on her face, and every breath she took sounded orgasmic.Aside from a euphoriant patch, she wore nothing but a neurolette, which enhanced the experience.Sophie went over to her and gave her a gentle shake.Mom?Mom its me.Were home, she said.Chika turned her head and smiled at her daughter.Hi sweetie, she said.She touched her euphoriant patch and dialed back the dose to a more functional level.Give me a minute to come down, okay.Is this new?Sophie asked, picking up a patch from the table and eyeing it hungrily.Chika nodded while biting her lip.Best Ive had in a long time, she said.She then looked at Ilene with insatiable lust.I cant wait to find out what sex is like with it.Me neither, Sophie said, ripping off her old patch and putting the new one on.Start it on low and amp up gradually, Chika advised.Mom, I know how to bliss out, Sophie said.Which bedroom is mine?That one, Chika said, pointing to her left.You have a Cornucopia right by your bed and your own jellybot, so you never have to get out of bed if you dont want to.I wont, Sophie assured her, dragging her boyfriend into her new bedroom.Ilene knelt down beside her wife.Have you been eating?she asked maternally.Humans were a little bit better than rats at remembering to keep themselves alive during long sessions of bliss, but only a little.Yeah, Ive been snacking on boufage, Chika replied, gesturing to the bowl beside her.Boufage was basically kibble for Humans.You need a full meal, Ilene insisted.Later.Take me to the bedroom, Chika insisted.No, you have to eat now, Ilene said firmly.What do you want?Lets compromise.Ill eat you out, Chika proposed, staring at her ravenously.Precious, please.You clearly havent had any real food since Ive been gone and that scares me, Ilene said.Remember our deal?Every time you get skinny enough that your ribs stick out you have to put on weight.You need excess fat for when you forget to eat.Its dangerous for you to be this thin.All right, Chika relented, forcing herself into a sitting position.For you, Ill gorge myself like an ancient American.Bring me a feast.Thank you, Ilene said.She turned to Marc.I dont need your help with her today, you can leave.If youre sure, Marc replied.Call if you need anything.Thanks buddy, Ilene said, waving him farewell.So you regularly help take care of that woman?Helena asked as they entered the hallway.On occasion, Marc replied.Chika likes to get so blissed out that she forgets to take care of herself, and sometimes she can be pretty stubborn about it.Right now Sophies only a little more active in reality than her mother, but I dont expect that to last.Why would a euphoria junkie even have a kid?Helena asked.Once she and Ilene were married, they were preapproved for procreation, Marc replied.And you know once youre preapproved, the government wont stop pestering you until you have at least one kid.They decided to get it out of the way early.Thats ridiculous.I always vote for stricter restrictions on procreative licenses, but I think theyve actually gotten looser, Helena complained.Well if procreation is controlled too strictly it causes civil unrest.Nobody wants to be told that they cant have at least one child, Marc said.Besides, the government likes to keep the population stable.Thats just a status quo bias if you ask me, Helena claimed.Come on; lets go check out our cabin.Their cabin was just a quick walk down the corridor.It had been provided with polymorphic furniture from the ships industrial Cornucopias, and it had its own domestic Cornucopia to produce any items they needed or desired.The Cornucopia was a nanofactory that could make anything as long as it had the power, data, and raw materials.Domestic Cornucopias lacked the precision to create functional living organisms, and of course would never make anything dangerous.They were hardwired to only produce items that add been officially approved by a centralized security council.If anyone even attempted to tamper with a Cornucopias software or hardware, the device would self destruct and alert the authorities.Even attempting to hack a Cornucopia was a serious offense.The ornate golden cylinder was engraved with symbols representing the four classical elements, because it could make food from just earth, water, air and fire (technically energy).Additional raw materials arrived either through a utility feed, or by objects placed in its recycling compartment.There were billions of Cornucopias in the Pananthropic Republic, and every citizen was entitled to a generous share of energy and raw elements as a civil right.They typically sold their surplus either back to the government, private industries, or more ambitions individuals.Cornucopias freed Human beings from wage slavery, making everyone independently wealthy.They eliminated both poverty and greed, since people had no attachment to possessions that were freely replaceable.That being said, Marc was immediately curious about why there was luggage in their cabin.Is this yours?he asked.Yes, I was at a Crafts Fair while I was on Earth.I bought some artisanal goods, Helena explained, dismounting him and opening up the boxes.Handmade stuff is so expensive, but I have to do something with all this money they give us.I honestly dont understand why they pay us so much.What do they expect us to do with it all?Its not really up to them.Half of any syndicates net revenue has to be equally distributed to its active employees and pensioners.They couldnt pay us less if they wanted to, Marc replied.Its still way too much, Helena said.After taxes, my salary is more than twice as much as my demogrant, and thats already more than I know what to do with.A few months ago I got a red flag for Dragons Heart Syndrome.I was shocked because Ive been reverse tithing.I give 90 percent of my salary to charity, and I stuck the rest into a savings account because I didnt know what else to do with it.When I got the red flag I actually bothered to check the damn thing for the first time in ages, and after thirty years that savings account has grown into a Dragons Hoard.I could have bought a mountain, hollowed it out, filled it with classically precious metals and stones, and bioengineered a dragon to guard it.It was embarrassing.I gave 90 percent of that to charity, threw a huge gala in my hometown, and bought a bunch of artisanal crafts to give away as gifts.I wasnt actually hoarding the money.Im not crazy.I honestly just lost track of it.I understand.It can happen to us rare few who earn a steady salary, Marc replied.It even happened to me once.You got a red flag for a Dragons Heart?Helena asked in disbelief.I did.Now I have a gold cap on my accounts, and anything over that cap is automatically donated to charity, Marc replied.Thats a good idea, Helena agreed.But I got you some presents too.Let me show you.As she started rummaging through her bags, she shamelessly passed gas since her gut flora was genetically modified to produce pleasant smelling flatulence.Their society was so obsessed with perfectionism that their shit wasnt even allowed to stink.After rifling through her luggage for a minute, Helena pulled out a pair of ornate silver chalices.These were made by an actual blacksmith, she told him.The guy actually makes stuff by heating metal in a furnace and then beating it with a hammer.He even looked like a Dwarf.I love artisans!Theyre so weird like that.She handed him the chalices, and pulled out a bottle of berry wine.I thought we should have a real bottle of wine to celebrate, she said.She uncorked the bottle and filled the chalices.This wine wasnt made by people, but it was still made with real berries.They raised their glasses in a toast.To you and me finally getting back together after all these years, and to the Deitys maiden voyage.Starwards and homewards, Marc added for luck.Two      The Deity was launched with pompous ceremony, and after only a few uneventful days was deep in intergalactic space, en route to its distant and uncharted destination.The Deitys bridge was a perfectly circular room with a domed ceiling.The domes interior was covered in a 3D screen, providing a holographic view of the outside Universe.Six large consoles circled the rooms perimeter.The Captains chair sat in the exact centre of the room on a raised dais, with a less ornate executive chair to either side of it.In front of that was the helm, and behind it was a holographic display table.Despite being the ships command center, the bridge was almost vacant.Marc was in his central chair, speaking with Helena (who was sitting in Ilenes spot), and the Head Navigator Kamadev Kumar sat at the helm.Kamadev was slender with sienna brown skin and shoulder length dark brown hair, wearing a gold shendyt His job was basically babysitting the autopilot.Like nearly all Human jobs, it was superfluous.Ilene stepped onto the bridge, holding a large cup of Chocaccina in one hand and a paper thin tabella computer tablet in the other.Chocaccinas were basically hot chocolates infused with advanced nootropics and anti somnolents.This is from Sook yin.Its her post launch medical evaluation on the crew so far, along with a list of everyone who still needs to be examined, she said, handing Marc the tabella.She quickly noticed Helena sitting in the XOs chair.Why are you in my spot?she asked, holding back her irritation as best she could.I I was, Im talking to Marc, Helena replied nervously.Blades, its just a chair, Marc stated.No, its the chair to the right of the Captains Chair, because its for the Captains right hand, who is me, Ilene stated.If anyone other than me sits in that chair, it is nothing less than a blatant subversion of my authority.Blades, youre overreacting, and I really dont like you talking to my wife like that, Marc chided her.Please apologize to her.Apologize?Are you telling me that if she was anyone else you would stand for this?Ilene asked irately.This is nepotism.Marc arched an eyebrow at her.Youre only my XO because were friends, he reminded her.True, but this is nepotism thats not in my favour, Ilene replied.Helena couldnt help but smirk.Get her out of my chair!Apologize, Marc insisted calmly.No, its okay.Im getting up, Helena acquiesced.She began to rise, but a tremor through the ship made her sit back down and grab the armrests.What the hell is that?Space Kraken?Ilene suggested.Weve entered a region where the cosmic dust is at least several orders of magnitude denser than normal, Kamadev reported.Its really messing up our stress energy tensor.The gravity bubble is destabilizing.Im shutting it down.Magnolia Creek, please report to the bridge immediately, Marc ordered through his neurolette.Kumar, dont worry about getting us back to hyperluminal just yet.Id like our Cosmologist to analyze this region first.Aye sir.No.Marc, we should get out of here, Helena said earnestly.She suddenly appeared very frightened.But no ones ever detected such a dense region of intergalactic space before, we should at least he began.No, now!Helena insisted.What the hell is wrong with you?Ilene asked.Blades, its all right, Marc said.Helenas clairvoyance wasnt very strong, but it was always right.When she sensed something was amiss, Marc took her seriously.Kumar, get us out of here as soon as possible.Aye sir, Kamadev said, slightly confused.To everyones surprise, Drkp stepped onto the bridge.Whats going on?he asked sharply.Drkp.It seems that weve stumbled into a region with an unusually high density of cosmic dust.Weve been forced to stop.Marc explained.It doesnt appear to be dangerous, but somethings setting off Helenas spidey sense.I assume thats what brought you up here.Drkp barely acknowledged his response.He stood at the console behind him and started taking readings.No.This cant be here.How is this here?he asked himself softly.What are you mumbling about?Ilene asked.I know this place, Drkp replied.But its grown.According to this, its more than four hundred lightyears across and two thousand lightyears long.And its moved.It shouldnt be here.It shouldnt be anywhere near us.Captain, we must leave at once.Were in tremendous danger.From what?Ilene asked confused.Would someone please tell me what the hell is going on?I believe you.Our navigator is working on it, Marc said.Im still trying to figure out the dusts average density here, Kamadev reported.Until I get that it wont be safe  It isnt safe to remain here.We have to leave immediately!Drkp insisted.Before Marc could respond, the ship was subjected to a sharp jerk.What was that?he asked.Im sticking with Space Kraken, Ilene said.Its too late, Drkp said softly.As Magnolia came onto the bridge, he sat down at one of the port consoles and started working.Whats happening?Magnolia asked.She was a short, thin woman with pale skin, rosy cheeks, and blue eyes.She had a tussled mane of white blonde hair, and wore an Alice blue tunic.Take your station.I need a report now, Marc ordered.She sat at the console where Drkp had been standing a moment earlier.Were in the periphery of an immense gravity well, she reported.How is that possible?Ilene asked.Gravity wells dont just come out of nowhere.Whats its source?Marc asked.I cant tell, but were being pulled towards its epicenter, Magnolia replied.Were accelerating at thousands of meters per second squared and rising.Grav shielding and inertial negation is holding.A hell of a lot of good that will do if we crash into whatever it is, Ilene stated.I take it the gravity wells too powerful for us to jump back to hyperluminal, Marc said.Im afraid so sir, Magnolia replied.And the gravitational pull is too powerful for our grav shielding to help us.Kumar, full reverse.That will at least slow us down, Marc ordered.Aye sir.Blades, get on the com.Tell the crew whats going on and sound general quarters.Im on it, she said.She kicked Helena out of her chair and activated the ships P. A.  Attention everyone, this is your XO speaking.We are currently caught in a mysterious and ominous gravity well of unknown origins, but should be okay unless our grav shielding shits out, in which case the tidal forces will spaghettify us into sub atomic particles.If its any consolation, thats always fun to watch.Blades, this is serious!Marc chastised her.She raised her hand and nodded in an apologetic gesture, and made a more fitting announcement.That doesnt even make sense, Magnolia claimed.Were not in a black hole.We wouldnt be spaghettified.Never mind that.
