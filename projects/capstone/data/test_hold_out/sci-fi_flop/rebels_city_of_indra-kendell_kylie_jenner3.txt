Click click click.Dont look down.Dont think of their faces sixty feet below you.You wont find compassion or support there.Imagine your legs are heavy as stones beneath you.Nimble, Livia.Steady, Livia.One direction, then another.Whirling in rapid circles, then suddenly decreasing in speed.Going slower and even slower ...then fast again, the world disappearing into blurry color bands everywhere I looked.I slipped.Faster than thought I dug in and caught myself on the edge.My whole body rushed with adrenaline.Instead of Marius, I could hear Etiquette Tutor in my head.Imbecile.Livia, you are utterly hopeless.Ridiculous.Then it occurred to me, balancing on the air above her: Who was Etiquette Tutor, really?A very tall woman with sharp cheekbones and an unpleasant disposition, who had never been celebrated at an Emergence Ball and never cohabitated.She led not by example.Focus, Livia.I sought to find empty space in my mind, just as Master informed me true warriors do.Everything kept revolving around me.Yet at the center, I was unmovable.Rotating in never ending circles, where nothing could touch me.No one said a word as I descended on the lift and disembarked.Their faces betrayed their awe and confusion.How long had I been up there?It must have been quite a while for Etiquette Tutor to finally cease turning me.Anticipating a throw that would never come.Everyone turned to her, awaiting her response.I had done well, we all knew that.For once, she had no other choice but to compliment me.Let us move on to Pleasant Interaction, she said.One person was looking at me, though.I caught her eye before her gaze flickered away.I had never seen an expression like that, not even on Etiquette Tutors face.In that split second, I sensed everything.Mica.And the feelings were far from proper.In that moment, she chose to despise me.I had a sudden revelation: I could try to be like the others, but I would never succeed.Even more surprising?I had no desire to try.Not anymore.In that way, my fate was sealed.6           Countdown to Final Simulation Exam: 4 Years   Lex   Be Industrious.Be Vigilant.Behave.It was upon these three principles that all cadets were molded.Be Industrious: We woke promptly and groomed before morning rations.We attended two block classes, were given an hours rec timetime enough to eat afternoon rations and do some light trainingbefore two more block classes.Followed by evening rations and rec time, usually spent reading and on homework for the next days lessons.Then lights out.Every day of the week, every minute of it, our lives were accounted for.The PCF Academys regimen had successfully shaped its graduates into becoming Indras foundation.Be Vigilant: First, you hold yourself accountable.Always show up on time.Always get your work done.Then, you hold your fellow cadets accountable.Their failure is your failure.Otherwise, all of you are doing laps around the track and no ones happy with the cadet whos to blame.Behave: This one, I had trouble with.No further explanation needed.The most promising youth.Thats what Senior Lieutenant called us.And he meant me, too.Even if theyd never had an orphan in their ranks.After the pod confinement from my altercation with Cassina, I threw myself into Academy life.I was going to stick to my promise.Work harder.Be smarter.Be stronger.Cassina stuck to her promise, too.She planned on making me pay.At least, shed spend every waking hour trying.Cassina was sure Id been an Academy mistake.She told everyone within earshot.Those first weeks, it took everything I had not to make her bleed again.The worst part?Secretly, I wondered if she might be right.It had always felt like an accident, being special.Maybe this charade was at its end.I could be found out at any moment.Bottom out, as if Id escaped my true fate and was living on borrowed time.Not if I could help it, though.No way I was gonna mess this up.Not a chance.I learned to ignore her.I learned to ignore the names.Mudgirl.Orphan waste.Dirtbaby.At all times I could feel their eyes burning into me, Cassina and her pack.I heard she was born Low Level, one said.Like, core low.I knew what core low meant.Down here, we were nearer to the crust of the earth.Being crust was a good thing.Core?Not so much.That meant Rock Bottom, way down below us, near the center of the earth.Thats where Indra started a thousand years ago.Before the population grew and the citizens reached for the sky.A thousand years ago, only the worst of the worst chose to remain below.I couldnt imagine why they would do such a thing.And generations later, the worst of the worst were still there, causing damage and creating chaos for those of us above.That was why the PCF existed.To preserve the peace above and to quell the troubles below.Where everyone thought I came from.In a brothel, said one.Her mom was, like, a prostitute.A Mudtown brothel, dirt walls, dirt on her back and knees.Can you imagine?Of course I can, said Cassina.So low shed probably even engaged a mutation.As if shed ever seen a dirt wall.She sounded sure of herself.When she spoke, everyone shut up.Didnt want to miss a word.Less than a week, and she was already their queen.Im not surprised, she continued.She reeks of Low Level.Not something you can hide.Thats what happens when they recruit from outside Indra.Looks bad for the Academy.For all of us.Shes an experiment ...and its not gonna work.Just wait and see.I could hear every whisper.Of course, they didnt know that.Not all of us would become PCF.Not all of us wanted to.Some would be happy to join a policy committee within the lower ranks of the High Council.Not me.Not since Commander Hauser visited us in our first year.I had never seen a sharper haircut, or cleaner uniform, or so many medals within the Academys halls.He was tall and handsome, even if he didnt smile.He instantly made me feel safe, if that wasnt already high on his list of priorities.Yesterday morning, he said, standing at the front of our first block classroom, at oh seven hundred hours, the Hub came under attack.A team of two, disguised as maintenance workers, planted an explosive charge in a transport tube.If you havent already noticed, Cadet Forza is absent today.His older brother was killed while traveling to work.One hundred and twenty one others died alongside him.It is the largest rebel attack in Indras history.It is all of our jobs to make sure that it is the last.You wouldnt be here if Indra didnt see something more in you, Hauser continued.Your acceptance here is a privilege, and with that privilege comes responsibility.To yourself, your fellow cadets, your instructors, your city.Our city.The Founders settled Indra to learn from the mistakes of former earth, to continue to reach and strive to greater heights.And yet, there is a pocket within us that would rather see us die.For that reality to shatter.As I stand here before you, I will not let that happen.And you will not let that happen.We will retain solidarity in the face of those that seek to endanger our lives and destroy what we have built.It felt at that moment as if he were speaking directly to me, his eyes hard beacons into the heart of Indra.I wanted nothing more than to serve at his behest, and to show all whod doubted me that I was still there to protect them.Otherwise, we do not deserve what the Founders fought for.No longer could we inoculate ourselves from the reality of what we were training for.Rebel.It was the first time I truly understood the word, or learned of people who held Indra in such contempt.I became restless.Placements were so far away and we could only play at soldier here.It was all anyone could talk of, and for an orphan like me, I was curious about how much the other cadets knew about the world.It seemed like everybody knew somebody who had been affected.Id thought Indra was much larger than that.Perhaps in light of Commander Hausers visit and the Hub attack, a good game of zip ball was either the worst or best thing we could do.I felt the tension as I strapped on the gloves.I had no love for the game, but at the Orphanage Id grown good at it.There, the field was pockmarked with gaping holes you could break your ankle on, and those electrodes on your fingertips would drop signal unexpectedly.You lose control of a fifteen pound metal zip ball in midair, you could get real hurt.But if you learn under those circumstances, you can play out of your mind on a real field, like the one at the Academy.We lined up on the sidelines as Cassina and Vipsinia chose teams.Cassina chose Kane first and he looked back at me as he jogged over to join her, shrugging his shoulders in amusement.It wasnt a surprising choice.Whenever she was captain, the other team would just pick me last, knowing she would never take me for her team.This didnt really hurt my feelings.Except Vippy, out of some weird pride, couldnt help picking me first.I wasnt happyshe couldve spent that pick more wiselyand Id always clearly shown my emotions on my face.For todays five a side game, we had Vippy, her two fellow Hubbers, and Caesar, who was from somewhere in the Lower Levels.Not exactly an ace squad.I like to play a fast game.Keep the ball moving between my teammates, keep it out of your opponents hands, and tire them out.My team wasnt quite built for that.Vippys loyalty to her fellow Hubbers sabotaged a truly competitive match, but as long as I was out there, we had a shot.We put on our helmets and jogged onto the field, the electro fields humming from the skin of our gloves.You never actually touch the ball, but you can feel it, if that makes sense.Not its full weight, but its ...potential.The scoring buzzer sounded quickly.Cassina may be confident, she may have been the captain, but she always plays the player, never the ball.I got the ball to Caesar, who cut it right back to me.High sidewalls allow great bank shots if you play the angles right.There can be as much as five feet between a zip ball and the person controlling it.You can get faked out that way.You can also fake yourself out if you stretch your electro field too thin and get too cocky.Kane didnt even have a shot at redirecting it; it was already passing through the goal as he was diving for it.That couldve been our only goal, but it still wouldve been worth it to see Cassinas despair.She immediately shouted at her team while I forgot just how much I didnt believe in my own and gave them all pounds.Caught up in our own celebration, I couldnt have anticipated just how angry Cassina was.The zip ball slammed directly into the back of my head, cracking the helmet where it hit.I fell face first into the ground and my head exploded with pain.So much pain I couldnt even see.Kane was kneeling by my side, but I could hear the rest of Cassinas team laughing.All I could do was hear.What the hell, Cassina?!It was a live ball, she said.Not my fault.You get scored on, you have to run it out from your end.It makes it that much easier for the scorers to go on a quick run if they mount a press and steal the ball so close to the goal.My team shouldve immediately gone up to press.Cassina wasnt wrong about it being a live ball, but you dont ever headhunt.On that, she knew better.Stay right there, Kane said to me.I rolled onto my side and could make out only the blurred shapes of my teammates.Your visors all cracked.Wait right here.He shouldve known me better.I sat up.Lex, games over.Lets go get you checked out.No ...damn way, I said, my head feeling as if it had broken right open.Everything I did made it feel like the crack was getting wider.Kane helped me to my feet.I couldnt see a damn thing.But I could hear the zip ball clearly, several feet away.It hummed at a low cycling rate.Kane waved his hand in front of my face.His gloves electro field hummed at a much higher one.If I could concentrate away from the pain, which truthfully is all I could feel, maybe I could hear the individual electro fields of every player.Possibly ...I slowly walked over to the zip ball and rolled it toward ...someone, with the tip of my foot.One nil, us.Someones electro field engaged and I could hear the ball several feet higher than my head.I tried to make a play for it, but it was already thrown downfield.I ran blindly, focusing so hard on the sound of the ball that I crashed right into ...someone.We both fell to the ground.You okay, Lex?Im fine, Vip.The goal buzzer sounded.Cassina and her laughter just had to be even louder.One of the Hubbers retrieved the ball and brought it back out.She avoided me and passed it off.They didnt even get it to midfield when the ball sailed for too long and then someone grunted as they ate it on the field.I got it!Kane yelled.His legs pumped down the field, his footfall sounding far closer than anyone elses, the ball secured in his electro field, which buzzed brightly as it hyperextendedthe energy positively cracklingand pulled the ball back and forth.Another couple seconds and he had a clear shot.Just my impaired self and the goal.He hesitated.No way was this fool going to go easy on me.He wouldnt dare do me that way.No way.What a  He sidearmed it and launched it on my strong side, low and fast.The balls electric whine whistled as it shot toward me.My gloves field couldnt slow it from this range, but damn if it couldnt redirect its trajectory.I reached out and could feel the tension between field and ball, catching ever so slightly ...right before it blasted past the electro and hit just wide of the goal.I brought it back and signaled for a time out.Guys, huddle up.They huddled closely around me.The two Hubbers were huffing hard from their exertion.My vision had improved to a complete blur deadened by black spots that shifted every time I blinked.This is going to be hard, but I think we can win this.We just need one goal.If you can get me one goal, I will make sure they dont score any more.Youre going to be goalie?Caesar asked.Youre the best player we got, Vippy said.Yeah.If she scores.Caesars heart was beating hard.What he didnt know was that with my hearing, at least from an offensive perspective, I couldnt detect the goals.They werent electric, so they made absolutely no sound.There was no way I was going to thread a zip ball through one of those.But defending one?That played into my sets of gifts very well.So tell me, whos gonna get the goal?There was no rush of hands being raised.But there was one.Vippy.I looked in the direction of her raised hand.You better.Well, she didnt score.She didnt even come close.But neither did Cassinas team, so I counted a tie game as a personal victory.Even though my head ached like a groundquake, my sight was improving.I mean, I could at least tell that Kanes smile was incredulous.The amount of pain I was in, it didnt even give him problems about thinking twice about scoring on me.He wasnt soft, he was just ...Kane.Later that week, we settled in for afternoon rations when I heard the chatter.The chatter quickly grew to a roar, and I thought that if there was any real trouble happening, the instructors would step in.Even Kane shrugged it off when it first began.But when I saw the instructors step out of the lunchroom and actively ignore what was clearly an out of control situation, I couldnt ignore it any further.Perhaps they thought a fight would expend our energy.Perhaps one death, or two, was a necessary sacrifice.Cassina and several of her paramours were gathered around a table.Vipsinia was on the ground next to it, one cheek puffy from being hit, her Hubber friends having already retreated way across the room.So much for loyalty  Are you a rebel?!Cassina shouted at her.Vippy was nearly in tears.Well?!Are you?Vippy was shaking her head furiously, but couldnt get them to leave her alone.I pushed my way through the growing crowd.Back off, I told Cassina.One of the rebels came from her zone!So?Of course a dirtgirl like you  would be too high minded not to jump to conclusions?If that whole zone was rebels, dont you think the PCF wouldve imprisoned them by now?Whod allow Vippy to even be here if that were true?Cassina screwed up her face, nearly out of her mind.Maybe youre one, too.I pushed her hard against the wall, taking her off her feet.One of her male companions put his hand on me, not seeing Kane right behind him.Kane tripped him, and sent him sprawling onto the ground.The other companion helped Cassina up, which she didnt appreciate, red faced.A rebel!she yelled.At least we all know it now!If you ever call me that again, you will see just how rebellious I can get.As much as I didnt let her see it, her words stung and there was nothing I could do to reverse their effect on the other cadets.The break time buzzer sounded and that was all it took for the mob to disperse.Vippy still hadnt moved, so I told her, Get up.She wiped the tears from her face, and Kane took her hand and pulled her up.She sniffled.Thank you.I had been angry for most of my life.It was the sort of thing Samantha had curbed just with her presence, and Kane was growing to fill that role as well.But herein the wake of the past week, of the past year, and all those that came beforeI felt those instincts become completely unhinged.I was beyond thought, beyond compassion.I looked at Vipsinia and all I could see were the same doubts Cassina had.A rebel.I feared that I had stuck my neck out for one.I used my size to show her how serious I was, and she held her ground as I pinned her back.On your life, you better not be one, I said.7           Countdown to Emergence Ball: 1 Week   Livia   The sun warms my back as Veda and I trot the winding dirt pathways through the village, passing weeping cherry trees and thatched huts.Outside one thatched hut, an aged woman hunches over a loom weaving iridescent patterns.Farther ahead, others gather at the river to rinse their garments, wringing water from them and gossiping loudly in their ancient tongue.As of yet, weve gone unnoticed.I halt Veda just beyond a prayer garden.Rest, I tell her.She shakes her ivory mane.Veda loves it here.My mother adored Veda, often wishing she could take her into the Archives.In the end, my father implanted a personalized access chip in Vedas hoof that would mirror my mothers Archive experience.She simply led her to the reader pad built especially for Veda and placed her front right leg on the sensor, and they would enter the Archives together.For some reason, Vedas chip also works for me.Just as she entered my mothers Archives, she can enter mine.This is not logical, a fact of which Im well aware.Yet I have kept it a secret as long as I have known.If I want Veda to join me in the Archives, I simply send the thought to her and soon she is there beside me.I could be in the main quarters and she in the stable, and we will be together.I have always felt the emotions of others, but Veda is the first being who could sense me as well.Shes the only animal in existence, and I often feel just as alone.Now she looks at me, concerned.Where are you going?Dont worry, I tell her.Rest.She stomps the ground a few times, showing me her dissatisfaction, yet she complies.I leap the wooden gates and cut through a thicket of brush.Bushes are trimmed into strange, slanting angles.Squat trees, their trunks twisting and coiling.A trickling brook weaves through the lush foliage, the water swarming with glimmering neon fish.If only this were real.Still, the Archive training simulation is perfect, down to what I think is the sweet smell of cherry blossoms on the gentle breeze.This simulation is part of my swordsmanship training program, yet strictly prohibited by Master.You are not ready for opponents who fight with both sword and mind, hes told me.Perhaps one day, but not yet.You think too much, Livia, to engage in real battle.For all his warnings, Master never fails to leave the access chips unguarded.A test of my will, perhaps.A test I have chosen to fail.This may well be my last chance.At least, this is what I told myself as I slipped the chip from the black box this very morning.Next week I will have my Emergence Ball, and soon after I will cohabitate.Proper Cohabitated Women of Indrithian Society dont practice swordsmanship, even though my mother did.Now Im somewhere I have never been, with no concept of what awaits me.For just a moment, I recline on a flat black rock.The surface is pleasantly cool, though Im far from relaxed.This isnt a retreat, I remind myself.The wait is short.Im on my feet, hands grasping the hilt of my zinger, when I hear the first footstep.I have fought all breeds of enemy in the Archives ...but this is something altogether different.For a brief moment, I wonder if perhaps Master was correct.The opponent is unexpected, to say the very least.He stands there dressed in a kimono, smiling at me calmly, as though ready to initiate a warm conversation, perhaps even invite me to tea.I will myself to focus.I wont let his appearance deceive me.A samurai is never unarmed, even when taken off guard.As though he can read my thoughts, he draws a sword from the obi tied around his waist, the pleasant expression dropping as the sword rises.We both stare at its edge gleaming in the sunlight.He glares at me, his eyes as sharp as the blade itself.I pose, zinger drawn and humming, my body prickling with energy.The samurais face is rigid with concentration, barely a muscle flickering.His mind is clear, I know this from Master.Hes been telling me since we first began training when I was a little girl: The true warrior is empty of emotion.I close my eyes and force my mind to go blank.No Emergence Ball.No sashes.No Mica.No Etiquette Tutor or Life Guide or Helix Island.Only now.Only the battle.An almost indiscernible rush of wind: I know he has launched into midair.Im poised to attack before even opening my eyes.I leap, my rigid body cutting through space.In that brief moment of flight, I feel every hair on my arm rising.All it takes is the space between two heartbeats.Our blades clash.We spin away from each other, our weapons locked the whole while.Our dance is violent.His face is inches from mine, lips drawn over his teeth, a growl rising from his throat.The zinger releases a low note as I force him away.The impact throws me off balance.I land on my feet and stumble, disoriented, trying to catch my breath and regain focus.My eyes scan the garden frantically.Where could he have gone?A low groan.I turn just as he charges, eyes mellow, his form perfect.An unexpected beam of sunlight glints off his katanas edge, blinding me.Do not think.Forward thrust.I slice empty air.A faint whizzing to my left and I duck the instant his blade slashes down.He trims a lock of hair from over my ear.It floats to the ground.He was aiming for my head.His emotional armor cracks.Now I can feel his fury rising.His programming is so real that hes incapable of controlling himself.I have gone from a mild annoyance to a skilled opponent.A mere childa girl, even worsehas dared force him to work for his victory.Master didnt teach me to do this.To feel people.I have read emotions since I was a child.At first, I could only read Veda.I would go to her stable when I was confused or sad, and feel her fret over me.She would try to cheer me up with a little galloping dance.When I finally smiled, I could feel her satisfaction.I assumed it was only Veda I could feel.Perhaps because my father created her, I reasoned.Because she is the only one of her kind.Then one day, I hid from Life Guide in the synth orchard, and I could sense his frustration growing from the other side of the island.I knew when Master was planning an intense training, or Governess worried over my eating habits.Ive always felt people, but never in an Archive.He isnt real, I remind myself.Archive simulations are meant to train and entertain Indrithian citizens.Archive memories are different.They are a record of your past, allowing you to enter your own experiences.Archive memories replicate real events as you lived them.I had attempted to access my own memories countless times.Id hoped to see my mother and father, though I dont remember either.Perhaps they held me as a child, I reasoned, and the memory remains buried right beneath the surface of my consciousness.With every try, I would end up in a thick fog, a faint buzzing noise surrounding me.I have cycled through every day of my existence, painstakingly tapping each date into the personal memory chip were each issued as children.In the end, I found a few uninteresting moments, but none of importance.In one, Governess towered over my six year old self, encouraging me to eat my pudding.Even simulated, I found her very demanding.In another, I was picking synth flowers in the orchard and winding them into a crown.This cannot make up the entirety of my life experiences, I thought.One day I asked Marius about my memory blanks, and she merely gave a faint smile.I do not know, my love.Some have many archived memories.Others have few.But who decides?The High Council, she responded.By the tone of her voice, I knew not to inquire further.In all truth, little is known of the Archives and their origin.Yet there are a few facts of which everyone is made aware: despite feeling fear or pain, you cannot be permanently injured.You may be stabbed by a simulated enemy, yet you will wake unscathed.As for the human simulations, they do not have emotion.As real as they may feel, they feel nothing in the slightest.Yet here in the garden, I can feel this samurai.For a mere second, he seems to wallow in a hatred that almost feels authentic.Is this possible?Who is this girl?he wonders.Why does she fight so well?In that moment, he hesitates.In that moment, I swing.He gasps.We both gaze downward.A drop of blood blossoms across his white kimono.Its a flesh wound, yet I have caught him off guard.He stumbles backward and regains his footing, but not his composure.He grimaces at me, his face pained.His surprise turns to anger.Then he does something unexpected.He smirks.I follow his gaze over my shoulder.Four more samurai stand poised, swords drawn, eyes targeted on me.One opens his mouth wide and gives a bloodcurdling screech.Liv    ia!I blink.The samurai are gone, as is the garden.The brook, the winding trees, and the neon fish all have disappeared.Im stretched across my hovering four poster sleeper, covered in a sheen of sweat, every muscle aching.Instinctively, I reach for my sheathed zinger hanging on the post next to me.Do not, says a voice, low and lethal.I drop my hand and look upward.Governess is holding my access chip between two fingers.She has removed it from my wrist, instantly ending the program.Even if I could immediately return to it, my progress wouldnt have been saved and Id have to start the encounter all over.Her expression is disagreeable, to say the very least.I hope you found that activity a suitable distraction.Perhaps there are more appropriate uses of your time?I was fighting a class five samurai, Governess.Higher than Master even allows!I know the last part was a mistake the moment it comes out of my mouth.Indeed.Oh, Livia ...Governess believes swordsmanship to be an intolerable waste of time.As for the Archives, they should be used solely for enrichment, as a means of accessing ancient ruins and places of worship that vanished centuries ago.The Sistine Chapel.Taj Mahal.The Gardens of Babylon.Places of refinement, she calls them.Places of unimaginable boredom, I say.I cant tell Governess this, or anything else that matters.Especially not now, a week before what she calls the most important day of my life.Can you begin to fathom the extraordinary number of preparations necessary that  Yes, I say.an event of this magnitude  Yes, I say again.entails?she finishes on a high note.Cue the guilt, I think.I daresay, you do not consider my feelings.Not for one moment.The utter exhaustion innate in overseeing the multitude of obligations necessary for a ball thrown in your honor ...Of course I do, Governess dear, I say halfheartedly.Cue the indignant lecture.There is preparation, she says.You have obligations, Livia.You are well aware you should be en route to Etiquette Training, and I turn my back for one  What did she do now?Marius stands in the doorway, a placid smile on her face.Marius!How lovely!I say, sitting up quickly.Saved.Marius glides over, putting a tiny, delicate hand to Governesss large, bony shoulder.Instantly, the tension drains from her face.Marius has this effect on people.Her voice is rich and smooth, and her face shines like sunlight has been implanted under her skin.But for her its natural, not an enhancement.Her robes are always perfectly draped around her tiny frame, and her laughter contains just the right amount of music.Governess welcomes Marius as warmly as I do, but for different reasons.Marius is an outlet to share her vexations, of which I am usually the cause.A week until her debut, Governess tells Marius, and where do you suppose I find her?In the Archives, of all places!Indeed, says Marius calmly.And she has Etiquette Training!Not to mention the various  Poor Governess!You are a wonder.All those preparations!I cannot fathom the enormity of the pressure, my dear.Governess nods vigorously and gives a dramatic sigh.And somehow, you persevere.And look lovely doing so.Governess glows, and I marvel at Marius.She is most likely the only woman in all of Indra capable of silencing Governess.Tell you what.I shall have my driver transport her in our sky speeder.She might well arrive just in time.He is wonderful, my driver.Chauffeured for the High Council chancellor, as you know.Governess nods, as though the plan has already been agreed upon.And that will afford you a well deserved break.Must not wear yourself down, my dear.We need your strength.I will take the young lady off your hands.A small outing, I think, will serve both of you well.My heart soars.Lovely of you, Marius, but entirely unnecessary, says Governess.Yes, of course it is necessary.Even you need to recharge.At this, Governess smiles, which is a rare gesture indeed.Marius turns to me.How does that sound, my love?Shall we?I found an enchanting little hideout in the Archives where we can stop afterward.Yes!I say quickly.I mean, that sounds absolutely delightful, Marius.Governess sighs again.I know that sigh.It is the sound Waslo has made too many times.I hate Etiquette on a good day, and today is not one of those.Today is cinching.Though it is one of my last days, it will be a long and painful one.Mariuss driver is as skilled as she proclaims.He races across the sky, dodging shuttles and rigs, swooping through clouds.Due to our status, we are allowed to cut through other islands restricted airspace.Rigs and other craft must secure permits; that is why Helix is often left unlooked upon, except from afar.The ride is so exciting, I nearly forget where Im headed.If it were only so easy.Anything is preferential to cinching.Even dining instruction, which consists of everything but food consumption.According to Etiquette Tutor, Silverware must be properly positioned.Salad fork to the left of plate, then meat fork accompanied by fish fork.Salad knife to the right of plate, then meat knife, then soup spoon.Of this be wary: soup spoon, not fruit spoon.The incorrect utensil speaks volumes.Conversational Intercourse is even worse.Endless simulations from centuries predating the Great Catastrophe.A time, I come to understand, when the human species took great pleasure in posing charmingly in ball gowns and discussing absolutely nothing.It seems we have adopted the very worst of their habits.Lovely to make your acquaintance, Lady Ingrasol, I say to my partner.Indeed, the weather is divine.I do so enjoy these summer evenings.And do tell, what of the progress on your lavish garden?There is only so much inconsequential chatter I can withstand before I find myself telling Lady Ingrasol that if she doesnt refrain from another speech pertaining to this seasons glove length, I would, quite regrettably, be forced to enhance her eye with my salad fork.I failed that unit.Incorrect utensil usage, I suppose.Breathe, Etiquette Tutor says, drawing from your diaphragm, slowly and deliberately.Remember to be calm.Remember, you are ladies.I glance at the other ladies.We are all strapped into our cinchers, a network of cords restraining our bodies.Each of us is plagued by deficient skeletal structures.For some girls, the straps are tighter over their belly or chest, while others have the pressure focused on their pelvis and hips.The overall purpose: ensuring our waists are shrunk to the absolute minimum.Etiquette Tutor has an impossible figure.It is stated to be our ideal, yet she has no cohabitant.The closest she has is her enhancement specialist.The other girls dont appear the least bit uncomfortable, smiling at each other and engaging in polite conversation.They practice for their own Emergence Ball Grand Dinner, daintily holding tiny cakes between thumb and forefinger, nibbling and perfecting the art of being utterly enchanting.Each is thinking of how their own ball will unfold, dreams of perfection almost overcrowding her learned manners.The pain, it seems, doesnt affect them.Or perhaps they hide it better than I do.Despite the niceties, one must keep in mind that this is a competition.Somehow, Marius has arranged my ball to be the first of the season.It is apparently quite the honor to have at my whim a full complement of suitors.To me that only means more of them to dispatch.Another pull, says Etiquette Tutor.Big smiles, girls.She circles the room, adjusting each cincher with a gradual increase of pressure.We will bend, but not break, before her.I wince before she even touches my crank.When she does, its swift and forceful.The pain shoots up my spine.I clench my teeth, my eyes watering.Control yourself, I think, as if its a viable option.A moan escapes my mouth.It draws every eye in the room.The girls act completely surprised, though I know they are not.My failure is expected.As are their whispers and giggles.Next to me, Mica makes no effort to hide her utter disgust.Of all the girls, shes the one I despise the most.Livia!Etiquette Tutor calls in her moderately toned way.Show some control.Do you plan on making such unattractive vocalizations at your ball?With thousands of eyes upon you?We are taught that politeness is of the utmost importance.Yet I find the concept difficult to master, especially when verging on the loss of consciousness due to a lack of oxygen.Or maybe it was the endless monotony of years of lessons I deemed a waste of time; I could no longer bite my tongue.I do not plan ...on wearing ...a cincher ....at my ball!I gasp, my ribs grinding together.Is that so, Livia?I will wear my corset if I must.A Proper Young Woman neednt use the corset.You cannot be dependent on the corset!With that, Etiquette Tutor gives me another crank.To which I give her an even louder groan.Your fellow trainees are undergoing precisely the same exercise, yet they do not appear distorted in the slightest.What value in a tiny waist do they see that you do not?I must assume you believe your fellow trainees to be fools, am I not correct?I glance around the room, but the girls avoid my gaze.Glaring, as they are well aware, would be highly distasteful.Mica makes little effort to hide hers; she was always the pioneer when it came to hating me.The others believe in the value of cinching because each has practiced it religiously since receiving her first training cincher at age six.Governess saw to it I wouldnt be deprived the same honor, though I promptly hid mine in the storage quarters.I put her replacement to good use as well: target practice.After four more attempts, Governess conceded.Fortunately, your waist is already smaller than average, she said, exasperated.Due to swordsmanship, I told her.Lucky for you, I didnt choose needlepoint.Are you not seeking a wide choice of cohabitant?says Etiquette Tutor.Or do you find it dismissible that the Proper Young Men deem you attractive?The pain only grows in intensity.Theyre all watching me now and enjoying the spectacle.An enticing distraction, their favorite folly: watching the Cosmo Airess be put in her rightful place.The least I can do is give them a spectacle par excellence.I catch Etiquette Tutors gaze and stare at her, unflinching, as I force my words to sound calm and measured.My cohabitant of choice ...will care about things that truly matter.Silence.One of the girls flattens her tiny cake between two fingers, her jaw dropping at my utter audacity.Another gasps, and I wonder where she found the breath.I force my face high, giving them a sufficient view.I am Livia Cosmo.And yes, I am as incorrect and inappropriate and, I daresay, improper as you imagined.And your opinions do not matter to me.Not in the least.I force a smile.My last day brings with it the promise that the pain will stop.It just feels like it wont happen anytime soon.Her eyes flashing, Etiquette Tutor strides to my contraption and makes a swift adjustment.I choke on my own disobedience.Manners, she hisses.Mica catches my eye and mouths a single word, her lips puckering as though the word is sour.Orphan.Once, a very long time ago, Mica didnt consider orphan to be a dirty word.I was very little then.For all I knew, the entire universe was Helix Island, the population consisting of Veda, Governess, and myself.There were many others, of courseMarius and Waslo, Life Guide and maids and gardeners.Still, it never occurred to me that they came from somewhere beyond.I believed Helix to be the center of existence, and myself the center of Helix.That was before I knew better.A time when I ran the grounds in bloomers without worrying at soiling the whiteness.I climbed synth trees and scraped my knees.This was a time when Governess knew how to comfort.When hungry, I ate.Tired, I curled up in my tiny sleeper and fell into a dreamless state.Before I knew what it meant to be a Proper Young Woman.I did as I pleased and there were no questions.They pitied me, perhaps, and believed the coddling necessary.Poor little orphan Livia, motherless and fatherless and all alone in the world.Yet I never felt alone, with Veda and Governess and endless gardens and an entire island of secrets.Perhaps Im making a romance of memory and warming my recollection.For soon I would come to understand the world beyond Helixthe one I never knew existedwould be far crueler than I could have imagined.The first time I stood at the edge of Helix Island was after Sash Training.I was still in Micas favor then.Sash binding is meant to challenge, thus replicating the transition from innocence to womanly obligation, Etiquette Tutor told us, watching us fumble.Your sash is a true sign you are a Proper Indrithian Woman.Long after the others had finished their tidy bows, I was still at work.I couldnt get it right, smiling through my frustration, fingers growing dumb and slow, unable to solve this puzzle on my back.There was too much to remember.Sash horizontal to belly.Wrap counterclockwise in steady revolutions.Shift fabric to left, position at rear of body.Grasp edges between thumb and forefinger, measure for evenness.Left draped over right, right pulled under left; loop, pinch, and hold tightly.Wrap clockwise this time, revolutions still steady.Hold ends firmly and do not forget to smile.Pull.And yet, I couldnt make it work.Not that Etiquette Tutor made the task any easier, spitting insults, the other girls forming a perfectly sashed, glaring circle around me.You look like an uncultivated fool, Livia.Again.Once again.The process went on for what seemed like hours.I didnt succeed in tying my sash that day.Do not worry, Mica told me later.She took me aside during Pleasant Interactions.That day, Etiquette Tutor had excused herself at the end of our session.She did this often, knowing we would continue our silly, vapid conversations with or without her presence.That is how well shed trained us.Follow me, Mica whispered, and we ran off, the other girls pretending not to notice us in the clearing behind the bushes.Tying the sash means nothing, she told me.We have maids to do that, after all.This will be your real test.Are we friends, Livia?Yes.Do you trust me?Yes, I lied again.Close your eyes, she said.I did as I was told.I felt her reach for my hand and hold it in her own soft one.Do not scream, she said.There was a sharp pain, and I held back my shriek.Open your eyes now, she said.I looked down to see blood on my thumb.She had cut me with something.Look, she said.I am bleeding, too.She held up her own thumb.While crimson fell down the length of my thumb, hers contained merely a droplet.Now I will put my thumbprint inside your sash, and you will do the same for me.In that way, we will be eternally bound.You will be my friend forever, do you understand?I nodded and did as I was told, believing her lie.When we were finished, she nodded in satisfaction.When we returned to the end of Pleasant Interaction, Micas smile was smugger than ever.I didnt fully understand then, but I do now.She was proving her power.Mica was powerful enough to cut me.Powerful enough that I was afraid what would happen if I didnt let her.I kept my thumb wrapped in the corner of my sash.It took a long time to stop bleeding, yet Micas wound was so superficial it hadnt continued past that first drop.Somehow I was able to hold back my tears until I returned to Helix Island.Even in the transporter ride home, I kept my face impassable.The instant I set foot on my home island, I took off.Ran fast enough that no one had a chance to see me.Tears streaking off the side of my face, no idea where I was headed, only sure I must keep running.I decided there had to be a way to escape Mica and Etiquette Tutor.Their conniving eyes and judgmental voices I knew would never stop.Then I passed the designated borders and came to a sudden stop.I finally understood: I had known the whole time.I stood at the end of Helix Island and stared out into the clouds.There had been no stinger barriers, as Id been warned.No grass covered holes waiting to eat me.No need to fall into a dark hole.I had always been in one.There was only the edge, where island met sky.An entire universe that I would never know.8           Countdown to Final Simulation Exam: 3 Weeks   Lex   Three more weeks, says Kane, and I wont have to hide my art anymore.We stare at the ceiling.Its crazy, hearing him say that.Especially the three weeks part.Three weeks from now, Kane and I will receive our placements.Hell probably go to Upper Indra.Back to the air.I have no idea where Ill go.But it wont be aboveground, Im pretty sure of that.I wont see Kane every day anymore.No more hiding away in his creation studio.No more painting with snorts and shouts and buzzes.Just three weeks.If everything goes right.I stare at the ceiling of the abandoned weapons armory, mellowed out from boosters.Kane calls it the COC: the Center of Creation.This is where he makes his sound paintings.Sometimes he even makes sculptures from wreckage I help him collect.That first year we got to know the Academy inside out.The spaces no one used.The forgotten hallways and hidden corners, those places were ours.They belonged to Kane and me.When we found this one, we didnt need the others.This place is stacked with all the stuff Kane has swiped over the years.Even with the strict intake and supply monitoring, instructors still misplace inventory.Only since Kane entered the Academy, though.Kane can swipe as fast as he can rewire.Gone before you remembered it was there.No one suspects a thing.He just shoots them that innocent smile.It works on everyone.Other cadets, instructors, even the Middler ration distributor blushes, piling his tray with extra helpings.That kid gets away with everything.Cassina long stopped acknowledging him.If he chooses to spend his time with a core low smudger, then he is not worth mine.Spend time with a dirtgirl, you are bound to get filthy.Still, I catch her watching him.Her eyes follow him when he leaves a room.She loves him, I can tell.And it kills her that it only goes one way.Instead, she attaches herself to a new guy every rotation.She giggles and blushes, clings to his arm on the way to classes.Stares at him in a way that makes me want to puke.He will make a wonderful cohabitant!she tells the others, then dumps him.The breakup is always dramatic, usually in a crowd.You will never understand me!she cries, then races from the Rations Hall, tears streaming.Her followers rush to support her.It seems to me Cassinas relationships have little to do with understanding.The only one who doesnt care about Kane?Little Vippy.She only has eyes for me.This has been going on since the Book of Indra show off session.Of course, its me they suspect.Of everything.My admittance to the Academy still cant be explained.Even after all these years, I hear their complaints about this outcast orphan with top performance marks, beating records on her air speeder.There has to be a reason, though no one can figure out what it might be.How does someone like Lex end up here?And what does Kane see in her?Maybe he has, like, this weird thing for orphans, they say with smirks.Likes to Rock Bottom it, you know?Ive heard of guys like that.Hell never cohabitate with her, though.Those kinds of things you keep secret.What, hes going to move her to his estate?No way.Hes engaging with her, no doubt.Theyre wrong, of course.Weve never engaged.Not in the way theyre thinking.Not that I havent thought about it.Everyone thinks its happening anyway.It would be easy, I figure.We spend all our time together.One day, while hes talking, I could just lean over and ...But thats when my mind goes blank.Or I force it to.This is Kane, I remind myself.My only friend.Id do nothing to mess with that.Besides, I tell myself, I dont want to.Do I?I look over at Kane, still contemplating a creation studio he doesnt have to hide in an abandoned weapons armory.I dont care about cohabitation like the other girls.Its not required of cadets.Some do it anyway, but they mainly end up with Academy grads.Like meets like.Nothing changes.One girl from the Islands locked herself in her pod for two days, crying hysterically.Debut ball season, I heard her podmate mutter.Shed be having hers if the PCF hadnt recruited her.When Kane explained a debut ball, I just started laughing.Id never heard of anything so crazy.Didnt that girl know how lucky she was?She was a cadet.She was chosen.He told me this girls parents had lost their social standing, had lost their means to throw her a proper ball.She was chosen, sure, but it wasnt her choice.Still, she really wanted to prance around in a dress instead of blasting rebels?And what about you?I asked Kane.Would you have gone to those balls if you were still on your island?Yes, he said.Not even negotiable.Being without him?That scared me.That was nonnegotiable, too.In three weeks, Ill be right back where I started.Alone like in the Orphanage.Kane sighs.I still refuse to mention his weird behavior.Hes distracted a lot, disappearing for long stretches, showing up suddenly without an explanation.He doesnt smile as much.I keep thinking hell tell me on his own.Or maybe hes worried about the Final Simulation, just like me.Even though he pretends it doesnt matter.Besides, questions wont make anything better.Boosters do, though.Boosters make everything better.Like I never realized how fascinating the ceiling is.I cant believe you just walked in the medical unit and took them, I say.My voice sounds faraway, like it belongs to another Lex entirely.No one ever notices.Of course, wed scored boosters before.The first time we ever boosted, a cadet had smuggled them back from the City of Indra after midterm break.These onesKane found Sergeants private stash in a storage unit.How could you take that kind of risk?I asked him, furious.Why dont you just ask them to expel you!?Youre crazy!You might be right, he said.You want some?Of course, I said, palm already extended.Sometimes we just need a release.Boosters have all kinds of medical and tactical uses, but the bright pink ones made us laugh for hours about the stupidest thing.The yellows make me so relaxed I can melt into the steel floor like its a feather sleeper.But the ones he handed me now were different.Medical boosters, I realized, were far more powerful.Kanes secret studio is a hollow room beneath the main building.I can hear cadets running the halls above us, their thuds like the steps of giants.Smell the sharp, bitter odor of formulas mixed in the student lab two quadrants over.Heat emanates from Kanes skin, warming me from across the room.Wow, I say.What kind are these?Sensory, I think, he says.What you think they use them for?Maybe on missions, I guess.To hear enemies miles away?To smell out explosives?Intense, says Kane Especially for you, I bet.I mean, you can already do that stuff.Like, how I feel right now ...must be, like, how you feel all the time.Yeah, I agree.Probably.Is it too much?Nah, I say.Youd be surprised what you can get used to.Sometimes I wish I could do that stuff.Hear people whispering, see stuff through the dark.No, you dont, I say.Youd be as big a freak as me.And youre already close.True, he says with a chuckle.A few seconds pass.Hey!he says, sitting up suddenly.Youd tell me if I smelled bad, right?Cause youd be the first to know, right?That makes me laugh, and then he laughs, too.I cant stop.Hes the only one who does that to me.Then he snorts, or maybe I do.Either way, it starts a whole new round of laughing.We finally settle down, and then for a while, were quiet.I can hear his heart beating in his chest, and my own syncs with the beat.Kane is staring at his newest sculpture hanging from the ceiling above him.The sculptures are so different from his sound paintings.Still beautiful, but in a way that makes me uncomfortable.Horrifyingly beautiful.Come look at this, he says, motioning to his newest one.I already have, you cant exactly miss it.Still, I go over anyway and sprawl out next to him.Together, we look up.Bolts, wires, and empty rounds left over from Target Instruction, all fused together into the shape of a body.A face with spikes coming out of the eye sockets.The sculpture glares down at us.Whos that supposed to be?I ask him.You, me.Everyone, I guess.I give him a serious look.Is it tough on you?I mean, being so genetically dysfunctional?Liberating, he says, grinning.And it keeps me occupied.But maybe I should ask you the same question.I sigh.Maybe you should.I was just kidding, he says.Were silent for a moment.It really is everyone.The instructors.The cadets.The whole core low Academy.Yeah, but not for much longer.Pretty soon well be running the Final Simulation.And then well be out there, doing something.For real.Taking out real enemies.I feel the intensity rising inside me.Finding real Rock Bottom scavs and ...And what?he says.Punishing them.Decimating them.Theres a long pause.Sure.Pretty soon the unreal will be real.And the real, well, I guess that never existed in the first place.Not here.But I want to ask you a question.Why?Whats the point?Why take out anyone?I mean, it wont make a difference.Wow, Kane.You sure are smart.Specially on boosters.I sit up.All those raiding parties rising up from the core?If the core low rebels had their way, everyone above would be forced to join them.They want to bring civilization back to the way it was before, before Indra gave us something to look up to, and they wont think twice about blasting first.I pull out my blaster and place the tip on his forehead.Just like that.Its a real situation out there.Our people are getting killed.Just who are your people?he says.Its mean but Im angrier because its true.My people dont exist.But if I cant believe in progress, if Im always going to just be an orphan, whats this life for?
