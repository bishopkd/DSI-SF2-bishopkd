Stomper, Twitch, and Creaker took one ship while Zero, Eve, and Piss pants took the other.Eve piloted while Piss pants handled the readouts and Zero tried to get comfortable in the turret.Eve said to him over the intercom, Dont get us killed, Zero.That didnt instill him with an overwhelming sense of confidence, but he didnt blame her for not yet trusting him.She veered off course and said, Fire off a few rounds to loosen up.He didnt waste any time.It irked him that theyd left the other ship alone because of his lack of experience.He knew that if Volts was here they wouldnt be doing this nonsense.He trusted him.He let off about a hundred rounds before Piss pants said urgently, Hes got it.Get back on course.Just then a distress message came from the other ship.Stomper yelled in a panic stricken tone, Fall back, Eve.Were going down.There are too many of them and they have superior firepower.The training center has already been compromised.Theres nothing left.Fall back.Do you hear me?Eve punched the throttle and replied, Well be there in a few seconds.Hold on.Just then, at least twenty small blue alien ships whizzed over and around them.The blue ships didnt fire on them or even pay them much attention.They were too fast for Zero to respond to in time.He tried to get them in his sights, but he couldnt.They shrunk from view as they left the atmosphere.He was glad they ignored them, as there was no way they could have matched their speed or maneuverability.He left his post to get a better handle on what was happening.Then a light started blinking on the dashboard that made Eve yell out in anger.He asked what the light was and Piss pants said, It means the other ship went down.It means the homing beacon has been activated.They saw the smoke first, black and ominous.Then they saw the source of the smoke; coupled with a huge dark crater where the entrance to the training center was located.About half a mile away a thin tendril of faint smoke marked the crash site of the other ship.They zipped right past the training center, through the billowing smoke, to get to the crash site.Zero wanted to jump ship and rush into the bunker to check on Stacey, but he knew better than to interfere with Eve and Piss pants.They were already pretty upset about their fallen comrades and, to be honest, he was too.He was sure Stacey was fine anyway.She was a battle mech surrounded by other formidable robots just like her.That crater looked mean, but it was only about twenty feet deep.He doubted theyd even heard the explosion from a thousand feet down in the training center.They landed, but it was already clear they wouldnt find survivors in the crash.The ship was in a hundred pieces, scattered across a thousand yards of desert.The largest section was smoldering, but besides the flickering flames there was no other movement.Eve and Piss pants were out of the ship the moment it landed, leaving him aboard to man the turret in case there was a follow up attack.After half an hour of dragging wreckage around in the sand to try to uncover their fallen comrades, they gave up once it was certain there were no survivors.At one point Zero saw the entire trunk of a robot jutting from the ground, upside down.Eve was on edge and Piss pants was despondent.Eve said, None of them made it.This hasnt happened before.Weve never been overrun like that.We need to let Davis know whats happened.Piss pants fiddled with some buttons on the dashboard console.He was getting increasingly frustrated.Then he slammed his fist down on it, putting a spider web crack across its surface.Theres no answer from training camp.Shit.Theres no way they infiltrated it so soon, is there?Piss pants stared out of his window and said, We need to check it out.Eve lifted off as Zero worried whether Stacey was alright.The crater at the entrance to training camp was larger from close up.They jumped ship the second it settled.Zero refused to stand guard again.I know someone down there and I need to make sure shes okay.Eve looked at Piss pants to see what he thought, but Zero didnt care what his answer was going to be.They werent keeping him from checking on her.Once inside the crater, everything became clear.The gaping maw that was the lift chamber was littered with rappel ropes and a handful of contraptions that Eve explained were alien jet packs, abandoned after their mission down below.So they had invaded training camp.He could only assume everyone within was dead, but he had to be sure.He bent down and grabbed two ropes.He tugged on them to see how strong they were, and then dropped over the ledge.Eve and Piss pants tried to stop him, but they were wasting their breath.A thousand feet didnt sound like much, but it was a long way down when all he had to work with was a rope.Luckily he didnt need to worry about fatigue or whether hed have the strength to make it back up.Only about what hed find at the bottom.He felt ground beneath his feet, then lights erupted from his own body, pivoting around, illuminating the darkness.He had no idea he could even do that, but apparently his body knew it was dark and decided to light the place up.He could only assume it hadnt done so before because this was the first time hed found himself in the dark in a potential combat zone.It gave him a sort of half hearted relief.It was good to know his mech body wasnt completely useless.Some of the walls looked as though they were ready to crumble.Parts of the strutted ceiling had fallen away.He ran to the doorway up ahead.It was opened up to the training arena that, to his horror, was littered with mech bodies.His huge foot splashed in a puddle of red alien blood.He had a quick glance around for its source, but the aliens must have recovered all of their wounded and dead.Then he remembered there were three humans down here who mightve been responsible for gushing that blood.He would check for them, but he had to find Stacey first.There was a grouping of four mechs, all felled within ten feet of one another, metal limbs draped over other limbs, floating in a pool of hydraulic fluids.He checked them over for signs of life, but they were all fully shut down.None of them had the chest plate etching that would identify them as Stacey.His hopes werent altogether dashed until he ran to the barracks and found Stacey within.Her body was pocked with bullet holes and her metal frame was buckled in places, most likely from an explosion.She wasnt moving.She was gone.He hefted her body over his shoulder and carried her to the doorway, exiting the arena, and propped her against the wall.Then he went searching for any human survivors.But his heart was no longer in it.He truly only cared about Stacey and she was already dead.Davis and Hildebrandt were in pieces right next to each other.Davis arm had been blown off, leaving a ragged stump that had bled out.Hildebrandt had been shot in the chest.The hole was so big that an antitank gun or something mustve been used to make it.Zero couldve reached his arm right through it.It was overkill, but then again, the aliens must have used some serious firepower to take down dozens of super soldier robots.Hildebrandt had taken a round meant for one of them.He heard a scuffling and ran past the bodies of the trainers to find Delacourt on the floor in his office.He was trying to crawl to the door, but his knees kept slipping in his own blood.He saw Zeros shadow looming over him and he looked up.His voice was constricted and he gargled, coughing out a fat glob of blood, then his arms gave way, dropping him face down on the floor.Zero flipped him over and he screamed from the pain, so he propped him on his side.Delacourt was faint and dying rapidly.He gasped and tried to speak again, but he was too far gone.Zero had never watched as a person died.It terrified him.He wished there was something he could do, but Delacourt would never survive the thousand foot ascent up the lift shaft.It would take him too long to drag him up, and he was guessing he only had minutes to live.Delacourt laid his finger in the growing puddle of blood, then used it to scrawl on the floor in front of him.He had to dip it back in every time the blood thinned out.Zero was enthralled.Delacourt wrote two barely legible words.But they were useless, selfish words.Zero was hoping he would write down whod done this to the camp, or let him know if there were any survivors.Instead he wrote Get Henshaw.Zero hadnt taken a liking to Delacourt, and in his dying moments he hadnt redeemed himself to him.Delacourt didnt want to die.He wanted a doctor above all else.It was understandable given the circumstances, but he expected more from the commander.Zero nodded as though he even thought it was a possibility, which it wasnt as Henshaw was in space and Delacourt was already slipping into the afterlife.He considered putting him out of his misery.He even fidgeted with his holstered guns for a second, but he didnt have to act.Delacourt died right before his eyes.Zero shook his head sadly and then used his foot to erase the bloody words.A commander should be remembered for his accomplishments in life, not his final selfish act.Hed hate for anyone else to know how terrified Delacourt was in his waning moments.Then again, he didnt really know the guy.Maybe he wasnt the heroic badass he assumed he was.He left the horrific scene, walked back past Davis and Hildebrandt, and picked up Staceys body.He had to at least try and see if there was a way to bring her back to life.He used one of the dropped rappel ropes at the base of the elevator shaft and tied it around Staceys torso.He tied the other end around his own and then he climbed up with her dead body in tow, dangling beneath him.Eve and Piss pants were waiting for him up top.They helped him out, and then pulled Stacey up and over the top.Eve looked at her and then looked at him like he was an idiot.Shes gone, Zero.I know that.I couldnt leave her down there.Maybe theres something we can do to wake her up.It has been too long.Her back up unit wont be operational anymore.Even if it were, that body isnt fit to inhabit.The body itself is destroyed.He nodded grimly.He knew she was right, But maybe he was just too stupid to hear her logic, because he said, I dont care, and hefted Staceys body towards the ship.He laid it gently down on the floor and then sat beside her.He knew how idiotic he was being.He hardly knew Stacey in life, but she was the last person he remembered from Earth and he did not want to let go of that connection, despite the fact that it had already been severed.Eve and Piss pants looked at each other forlornly and then joined him in the ship.They lifted off and headed back to camp in silence.Piss pants helped him carry Staceys body into the living quarters.He even humored him when Zero insisted they plug her in, just in case it helped.Eve unplugged Volts to tell him the bad news.He hung his head.I cant believe theyre dead.How did the invaders get past our orbital defenses?How did they destroy camp before you got there?There was implied blame in his last question.Piss pants said, You wouldnt believe how fast their ships were.They shot Stompers ship out of the sky the second it arrived.Were only alive right now because we got there too late.Did anyone check out the training camp?Did any of you see it with your own eyes?Zero said, I went down there.Thats why shes here.He pointed to Staceys lifeless body.So theyre all gone?Every single one of them.I wish I could have helped.Eve said, It wouldnt have done any good.There were a lot of them and they buzzed around like hornets.They were so fast the motion sensors didnt pick them upthe warning siren didnt go off.We responded immediately when we heard their supersonic booms, but we were too late.Volts checked over the warning siren.He hit a button and it sounded.He hit the button again and it turned off.He shook his head in confusion.Theres just no way they were too fast to trigger the sensors.Well, the sensors didnt see them.This is worse than any of you realize.Were only alive because we served a purpose.If we didnt have training camp to protect we wouldve been shut down as soon as our defects were discovered.Zero hadnt thought of that.He was too caught up in the moment to consider what might happen next.Those in charge might decide they were now redundant.Volts said, We need to get back to the training camp and try and open up a link to Doctor Henshaw.Hell know what to do.Zero said, Youre not going to like what you see down there.Its a mess.Volts stared at Staceys broken body and said, I can only imagine.When they approached the crater that marked the entrance to the training camp, they saw the transport ship that brought supplies and new recruits.They put their ship down beside it and surveyed the area to make sure it wasnt some sort of trap.The transport wasnt due to arrive until tomorrow.Once they were sure it was safe, they all boarded the ship.The dock door closed on them automatically.Volts went to the command console to override the autopilot to get the doors back open, but he yelled for them.I got Henshaw on the horn.Get up here.Zero was the last to arrive up front.Sure enough, Henshaws kindly old face hovered holographically over the console like an apparition.Henshaw asked, Whats the situation?Volts did the talking even though he hadnt been there to witness any of the destruction.We were attacked by an unknown enemy.They were lightning fast and didnt trigger any of our sensors.Theyd already destroyed the training camp before anyone got there.Then they blew one of our ships out of the sky, and vanished.Henshaw looked at each of them in turn.He paused a moment too long when he saw Zero.He said, Im just glad you are all okay.Volts said, What do you think the ambassador will do with us when she finds out?Someone at the training camp activated a beacon when they came under attack.Thats why I sent this ship as a precaution, in case an evacuation was necessary.The ambassador would have been notified at the same time that I was.Im actually surprised I havent heard from her yet.You didnt answer my question.Son, Im sure you know how this works.You folks are rejects.You had a purpose, but that purpose is now gone.Im not going to let her shut us down.Neither am I.  But we need to concoct a cover story for you.If she thinks you are the last survivors from training camp she might consider keeping you around.But the moment she discovers youre defective, youll probably be decommissioned.So what should we do now?I need you to make sure the camp is obliterated.If she decides to see it for herself and discovers anything that might indicate you guys arent what we tell her you are, shell shut you all down.Demolish your own camp too, just in case she decides to check on the status of security.Well tell her theyre all dead, so wed better make sure it looks that way.Then you need to come back to this transport and come to me.You need to hurry.I dont know how much time we have.Zero chimed in, I found one of the units down there.Shes charging back at our living quarters, but shes unresponsive.Id like to bring her back to see if theres anything you can do to fix her.The others stared at him like hed just lost his mind.Henshaw said, Im sorry, but if shes unresponsive, shes gone.Theres nothing I can do for her.Well, youre going to try.Henshaw shook his head, but he relented.Go and fetch her unit while the others cave in the training camp.Can you save her?His virtual heart was racing.Probably not, but I also dont want to waste any more precious time arguing about trivialities like this.Now get moving, people.The clocks ticking.Promise me that youll save her.Henshaw sighed.I promise.Zero didnt care that it was a long shot.He had hope again.He was the first to leave the transport.Volts said to everyone, Ill take Zero back to get his friend.You two need to make sure the elevator shaft is caved in by the time we get back.Eve glared at Zero.He knew she was worried about getting to the space station before the ambassador got there.If they didnt, he would be blamed, because he had put his own selfish desires ahead of their mission.But he didnt care.After retrieving Staceys robotic body and setting about a dozen charges hed retrieved from the armory all around the camp, Volts got back behind the controls of the ship and they set out to rendezvous with the others.Little faint pops announced that the charges had worked.Volts brought a couple with him to blow the ship they were in after they no longer needed it.Zero asked, Who do you think did this?Well, it certainly wasnt the spiders.I dont know of any race thats capable of this.The Beetars have plenty of enemies, but none powerful enough to take out an entire training camp of robotic cadets.Remember, Zero, were their muscle.The mechs that graduate go on to guard penal colonies and end armed skirmishes.We put down rebellions and take a bullet for whomsoever they deem worthy.One of us is enough to instill dread in the hearts of the enemy.There were dozens of cadets at camp.I cant imagine what could be mighty enough to wipe them all out so quickly.Should we be worried about them returning?Yes, we should.We need to get to the transport and get as far away from here as possible, or else we might be next.They touched down and Volts helped him heft Stacey inside the transport.He fastened her to the wall, then they went back outside to see what progress the other two had made.Luckily, they had just finished up.Zero noticed new numbers on their chest plates.Eve had the number seven written on hers and Piss pants had two scrawled across his.Volts asked Eve, Whats up with that?pointing to the numbers.Henshaw said we have to make it appear like we were cadets in training.He said if we make it look like we did well at camp, the ambassador will be more inclined to let us live, and put us to work.Zeros friend Stacey already has number one, so just pick a number under ten that hasnt been used.She handed Volts the same marker the trainers used on the cadets.Volts wrote the number four on Zeros chest and told him to write nine on his.Zero tried to convince him to go lower, but Volts said that would seem too obvious.He was right, but Zero wrote the number six before he could stop him.Volts was mad, but he didnt make a big deal of it.Eve said, The shaft is caved in.We need to go.Volts set the two charges inside the scout ship so thered be nothing left of it if the ambassador came looking, then they boarded the transport.Volts put the autopilot back on because they had no idea how to pilot the damn thing or how to find the space station.The lights dimmed as the ship gulped up the power to lift off.It rose above the surface and they hurriedly strapped in for the ride.Zero made a conscious decision to avoid plugging into the power port at his back right away.He didnt know how the others felt about this turn of events.Maybe they were ecstatic that they would finally get off world.Maybe they were excited about the new possibilities they now had in their newly acquired personas as phony recruits.But he was overwhelmed.In the past couple of days hed had his mind inserted into a robot, found out that aliens were real, and had washed out of training camp.Hed just barely acclimated to his role as security on Epigog and now that role was gone in a flash too.What did the immediate future hold for him?He had no idea and the implications frightened him half to death.He felt the G forces pulling on him as they accelerated through the atmosphere of Epigog.For the first time he wondered if the shuttle was even fit for transporting human beings.He couldnt tell if there was oxygen pumping into the ship.He didnt know if the warmth he felt was too hot or too cold for a flesh and blood human.He didnt see a way to eject biological waste or any type of food stored anywhere.Most likely it was only good for transporting non organics like him and his friends.The Gs lessened and then he saw Epigog through the little circular porthole across from him.From orbit, it was a brown hell hole with a few swirls of black and white here and there, sandstorms and rocky areas devoid of even the sand that had so plagued them on the surface.He wasnt going to miss it, probably because he hadnt been there long enough to get attached.He was looking forward to seeing Henshaw again.He hoped they would have time to get their stories straight before the ambassador arrived for a situation report.He prayed Stacey could be saved.Volts and Eve had aligned themselves with the recharging ports, so they were already out like lights.Piss pants turned from staring out through the window and said, Im plugging in.I have no idea how long the journey to the space station is, but Im guessing its long enough to bore the shit out of me.Ill see you when we arrive.He looked over his immense shoulder to see exactly where his recharging port was, then he nestled against it.The moment he did, his eyes closed and his head drooped.Zero looked over at Stacey.He sure hoped Henshaw could do something with her, but the clock was ticking and had probably already run out for her.But he couldnt let despondency settle in.A few very serious questions took up residence in his mind.If Henshaw could transfer their thoughts, then why wouldnt he create a back up or something and keep them stored in a hard drive of some sort?Maybe they wouldnt have to worry so much about Volts powering down if there was a back up of his mind stored somewhere safe.Maybe Stacey would still have a shot at life if Henshaw had had the forethought to keep another version of her tucked away on a disc or something.Then he could just upload her consciousness again into a new mech.He realized right then that he didnt have enough knowledge to make such assumptions.After all, if copies could be made, then there would be no need for so many different minds to run the mechs.Henshaw could just find the perfect mind and put copies of it into every single unit.He rubbed his metal temples and immediately realized how stupid that was.It was an instinctive motion he no longer needed.He decided against grilling Henshaw about his methods.He began to realize how stupid his questions would be perceived, especially since the doctor was trying his best to save their lives.The doctor wasnt incompetent.In fact, he was the only decent flesh and blood human hed met since leaving Earth.And their lives were in his hands.If he pissed him off, he might decide he wasnt worth saving.He had to go with the flow.He had to stop questioning everything and just give himself over to Henshaws wisdom.It was an epiphany that he wished hed had at the beginning.It was so much easier to trust that others knew what was best for you than to doubt everything everyone told you.He rolled his shoulders as he tried to zero in on his power port.He knew hed found it when his vision turned black.He awoke to a familiar face.Henshaw had a wry smile as he looked him over.Zero stepped away from the wall and saw that the others were waking too.Staceys body had already been taken out of the ship by the doctor.How do you feel, Jack?They call me Zero nowadays.Im alright, all things considered.I was surprised to hear about your weapons malfunction.I thought Id programmed you better than that.Zero nodded, wondering why the hell he cared.They had to get their shit together before the ambassador arrived, and Henshaw was wasting valuable time on trivialities.Is Stacey going to make it?Shes fine.I was able to retrieve her data.I knew you probably kept a back up just in case.Im ashamed to admit that we cant do that.We cant store so much information indefinitely.But I was able to retrieve her data from the transfer unit.Normally all of that info gets wiped clean when I transfer the next recruit to its robotic unit, but she was lucky enough to be the last recruit from your batch that I transferred.I still had a ghosted copy of her data.We got really lucky, son.It was serendipitous to say the very least.Is she doing alright?She seems fine, but you have to remember that she has no memories of Epigog or training.To her mind, she only just arrived from Earth.Can I see her?No.She still needs to be debriefed.Youll be pleased to know that I was able to give her a new body.That other one was damaged beyond repair.I already jettisoned it from the ship.I wouldnt want the ambassador to start asking questions.Zero was glad to hear that.Her original robotic body definitely was a mess, unfit for combat or much else.Volts and Eve watched impatiently as Henshaw wasted time blathering to Zero.Piss pants was pacing irritably.He said to the doctor: We should get ready for the ambassador, right?Of course, yes.Follow me.The others looked at Zero curiously, and he knew why.They were wondering why Henshaw was concentrating solely on him.He had no answers for them, so he shrugged his shoulders as he joined them in pursuit of the small old man.Henshaw led them through the space station and to the large room his group had had their reprogramming session in a couple of days ago.They faced the front of the room and the doctor pulled a chair out and sat down.He said, Ive tried to find out how the invaders got through our defenses, but the sensors picked up nothing.Did any of you actually see them?Volts said, They were quick little blue ships.Ive never seen them before.The doctor stood up.That doesnt ring a bell.Okay then, lets move past it.Now we need to make sure you each have a good cover story.With no training center you cant be reprocessed, and if anyone finds out you were rejected, who knows what theyll do to you.I wouldnt be surprised if they decided to just shut you all down until a new training camp can be built.Volts said, Whats so wrong with that idea?They can turn our minds off and wake them when the camp is suitable for training.Maybe some of us will make it through this time around.Henshaw shook his head slowly.Thats an option if they decide to exercise it.They might decide to scrap the lot of you and pin their hopes on the next batch of recruits.The robotics arrive the day after tomorrow, and the recruits will be here in three weeks.Zero asked, Would they do that?I hope not, but you never know.Is it worth the risk?They all mumbled amongst themselves.Of course it wasnt worth it to trust a stranger to decide if they should live or die.Henshaw said, The ambassador will arrive shortly, so lets get things straight.Youll tell her you were just days into training when the camp was attacked.You didnt see the attackers because you were recharging at the time.Through some stroke of luck the enemy didnt find you while you charged.Youll tell her that when you woke up everyone was dead and the invaders had already left.Then Ill recommend to her that because you were all at the head of your class youre ready for the field.I dont know if shell go for it, but its worth a shot.Eve said, Theyll find us out the second we malfunction in the field.Henshaw smiled devilishly.We still have some time to work out your various bugs.If Im lucky Ill be able to fix all of them before she gets here.That was music to their ears.But they knew their bugs werent the only way to identify them as rejects.That they had almost no experience training would be a dead giveaway if anyone pried deeply enough.But what choice did they have?This seemed like the only way to survive their new, shitty predicament.Zero saw Piss pants slap Volts on the back and clap Eve on the shoulder, and knew he was the only one of them to have reservations about any of this.It wasnt the first time hed felt alone in a group and he doubted it would be the last.Henshaw asked, Do you think you can all remember your cover story?Zero nodded, hoping the ambassador was dumb enough to buy it.Henshaw said, Jack, Ill look at you first.It should be easy enough to figure out why your weapons wont deploy.Take those ridiculous holsters off and hide them and follow me.To the rest he said, Ill be back for the next as soon as Jacks done.Then he walked from the room.Eve and Volts helped him wrestle the holsters off.Volts said, Well take care of these.Youd better hurry up before you lose the doc.Zero nodded a thank you and rushed from the room.He caught up to the spry old man and was led inside a room that looked like a workshop.Strapped against the wall was a single shiny new mech.Henshaw said, Thats your friend.Ill wake her and get her up to speed as soon as Im done with you guys.Zero didnt know enough about how any of this worked, but he had a question that needed to be asked before it ate away at him.What will happen to the human bodies of the training camp victims?Their data cant be retrieved, so does that mean theyll be mindless zombies when you fix their bodies?Henshaw swallowed hard.Theres no hope for them.Staceys was the only mind stored and that was only by chance, seeing she was the last transfer.The others died without a back up.Their bodies just didnt know it at the time.So what will happen to them?Protocol demanded that I flush them.What does that mean?Theyre no longer useful to the Beetars.The Beetars need only their minds to control the robotic units, and their minds are gone.As humans, theyre technically brain dead, so treatment had to be stopped.Once theyre taken from treatment, they die immediately without a mind to drive them.I cant have a pile of corpses rotting up here with me so I had to jettison them off of the space station.Zero almost gasped.Henshaws eyes misted, so Zero didnt try to make him feel any guiltier than he already did.But he was starting to see the other side of the wise old kindly doctor that he didnt like.He pushed the horror from his thoughts because there were more immediate concerns that required his undivided attention.He wanted to get a closer look at Stacey.He wanted to make sure the doc wasnt lying to him, but he didnt get the chance.Stand against that wall and well figure out what happened to your software.He did so and Henshaw used a pneumatic wrench to remove his chest plate.He plugged three wires inside of his chest.Zero was afraid to look down at the open cavity.He felt like if he did and saw the mechanical workings, hed have no choice but to accept that he had lost his humanity.The doctor picked up a handheld tablet and started to play around with the numbers scrolling across the screen.Zero tried to make small talk, but it became immediately obvious that Henshaw wasnt listening.He was too focused on the task at hand.Henshaw tapped the screen with his index finger and Zero felt a weird twitch in his legs.Then he heard a mechanical squeal and looked down to see two hatches open on each of his thighs.Inside were two handguns.Henshaw hit the screen again and a larger hatch opened lower down on his right leg.Inside was a rifle of some sort.He hadnt even known he had that in him.Henshaw hit the screen again and all three hatches slammed shut.He unplugged the three leads from his chest and finally said, Try to get to your guns now.He didnt know how.Henshaw mustve seen the confusion on his face.Pretend you need them to protect yourself.You need to need them to make them deploy.He imagined a couple of scenarios, but nothing happened.The doc said, Imagine that you were at the training camp when it was infiltrated.Imagine that you were the only one there who could save everyone.Hed barely formed the thought when all three hatches opened and his hands shot down to retrieve the two handguns.He held them up menacingly before he realized how inappropriate the gesture was.The doctor said, Good.I think we got it.Slowly, Zero put the guns away, then the doc closed his chest cavity with the wrench.Henshaw looked him in the eyes and said conspiratorially, Im sorry for your malfunction.I think it was my fault.I tweaked your settings away from their factory presets and I mustve done something wrong.Its all fixed now.Is that what happened to the others?Oh no.They simply malfunctioned.It happens.So his malfunction was a direct result of whatever Henshaw had done to him.Why did you change my presets?Henshaw avoided eye contact now.I was just tinkering around, is all.Youre all better now.He knew the doc was hiding something, but before Zero could grill him, the doc waved him off, saying, Send in the next one.Be quick.Were running out of time.He took one last look at Stacey and went to fetch the next patient.Eve volunteered to go next.He wasnt really sure what her malfunction was, but she was eager to get rid of it.She came back a few minutes later, beaming.Her body was shiny and new looking.She said excitedly, He knocked all the rust off these old bones and gave me a spit shine.I feel like a brand new girl.It was a smart move, otherwise the ambassador would suspect they were lying about being new recruits based on their decayed bodies alone.The only thing that remained of the old Eve was the number on her chest.Piss pants went after her and he too returned within minutes, shiny and new.Volts went last.He was gone almost as long as Zero.Probably because his malfunction was so severe.Maybe he needed an entire systems overhaul.Yet he returned with a spring in his step, his metal plates buffed and reflective.He whispered, The doctor had to go in through my back plate.I was scared to death that hed mention the hack job we did to bypass the kill switch back there, but he didnt say a word about it and he didnt undo the work.Zero screwed his face up.It was great that the doctor was suddenly on their side and wanted the best for them, but there was something off about his behavior.Wouldnt you think hed remove the bypass if he wanted us to pass as recruits?If someone else finds out what weve done, theyll know theres something different about us.Volts shrugged his shoulders.Im just glad he didnt fix it.Eve whispered, I agree with Zero.Theres no reason for the doctor to go to such lengths to help us.He has an ulterior motive hes not telling us about.Piss pants said, Maybe hes helping us because hes a good person.Eve shook her head.He tore our minds out of our bodies and stuffed them inside robots.Good people dont do things like that.Zero didnt know what to believe, but he knew suspicious behavior when he saw it, and the doctor was hiding something from them.Before they could go any further, Stacey walked into the room, followed by Henshaw.Zero stepped forward and she said, Is that you, Jack?He nodded and added, Its me, but they call me Zero nowadays.We all have nicknames.She smiled weakly.This is all so weird.She looked around the room at the identical mechs that stared back at her.She dug her finger into her chest plate and ran a deep groove down its length.Youll know me by this mark, she said.Then she put her finger against his chest and froze when she saw the etched groove already present.The moment was awkward, so he spoke up.We did this already, a couple days ago.Plus, I have this number four to identify me.She smiled, but there was a hint of sorrow in it that nearly broke his heart.She said, I have a lot of catching up to do.Its okay.You didnt miss anything worth remembering.Epigog sucked.Training sucked.At least you get a second chance.Yeah.I guess Im lucky, she said with a total lack of conviction.It was odd.He was ecstatic that she was alive, but she didnt seem to share his enthusiasm.He wrote the number one on her chest plate with the marker and explained that she was the only one of them to actually earn her number.She waited for him to explain further, but before they had a chance to talk more, Henshaw spoke to them from the front of the room again.I just overheard Jack tell Stacey that you are all using nicknames now.To him and Stacey he said, I apologize for eavesdropping.Zero shrugged.A little eavesdropping was hardly a breach of trust compared to ripping his mind out of his head and putting it inside a robot.Henshaw continued, We cant have any confusion.You need to either go by your nicknames or your birth names from this moment onwards.It made sense to keep things as simple as possible.The best lies were the clean ones with little elaboration, or back stories to muddle them up.Henshaw said, Who among you vote to go by your nicknames?Every hand went up except for Piss pants and Staceys.Henshaw said, Majority rules.Youll go by your nicknames from now on.Piss pants said, Thats bullshit!My nickname is Piss pants.Henshaw snorted and the room erupted in laughter.Even Stacey managed a chuckle.Henshaw said, Thats unfortunate, but standards must be maintained.If most of you refuse to go by your birth names, then none of you should use them.If anyone asks, just tell them that your parents had a weird sense of humor.Piss pants pointed at Stacey and said, She didnt even get a nickname.She gets to use her birth name, so I will too.Henshaw looked around at the rest of them.Is it possible for each of you to never again use this young mans nickname?Volts said jokingly, I dont know.Im too worried Id screw that up.Piss pants yelled at him, You always call me Dan in private.Stop making this more difficult than it already is.Volts smiled and said, Im just kidding.Of course none of us will refer to him by his nickname.Henshaw sucked air between his teeth in agitation.He was clearly flustered by the back and forth banter.Maybe he was too old to understand that Volts was just messing with him.No, no.I think we need to stick to parameters.Im sorry, son, but youll just have to live with it.Youll be called Piss pants until your assignment is over.Piss pants punched Volts in the shoulder.Youre a dick.I was just kidding.Im sorry.Henshaw cleared his throat loudly to get them to shut up.The ambassador will be here in less than an hour.With any luck shell believe our story.Fill Stacey in on details about training so she can at least pretend shes been there.Then he left the room.Piss pants shoved Volts aside and skulked off to the far end of the room.Zero didnt blame him for being upset, but a silly nickname was the least of their problems.He walked over to him and said as gently as he could, Get over yourself and get your ass over here with the rest of us.We have more important things to consider than stupid nicknames.His aggression caught him off guard.He was normally pretty docile and understanding, but the situation required more of him than that.Piss pants stared at him as though hed just punched him in the dick.Then he smiled and shrugged.I knew I was going to like you.Youre right.I can be a bit of a baby sometimes.He put an arm over Zeros shoulder and they joined the others.Zero was glad he understood.They each gave Stacey specific details about training.Zero didnt have much to offer since he wasnt there for long.She seemed perplexed, but she kept her mouth shut and her ears open.The doctor must have told her how important the cover story was to their survival, because she treated it with the gravity it deserved.By the time the pant suited ambassador arrived, they were fairly confident they had their stories straight.Her ship docked and Henshaw looked like he was about to keel over from a heart attack.
