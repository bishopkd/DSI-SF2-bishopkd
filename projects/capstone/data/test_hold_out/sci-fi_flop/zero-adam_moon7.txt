When they think were all dead, theyll let their guard down and we can catch them by surprise the moment they return to the surface.He looked at Zero for confirmation, like he would know how good or bad his idea was.Zero shrugged.I have no idea what they plan to do after they fire their nukes.He could only hope the Beetars wouldnt fall like the Cogmore leader wanted.The Beetars had to survive; they were his ticket off of this rock and only chance at a future worth living.Once again, he had only a thin sliver of hope to hang on to.He was very confused about who he was and what he stood for.He hoped hed made the right decision by telling the Cogmore about the trap, but he couldnt be sure.He felt like a traitor.The Cogmore leader told him his name was Damonesterpastor, but he let him just call him Damon.He lied and said his name was Zero for the sake of continuity.Damon led him around his camp as the Cogmores stared at him as if he were the antichrist.But at least no one threw rocks at him this time, probably because he was in Damons presence.After a while, Cogmores started to follow in their wake, whispering as they tried to catch up.Damon pointed out things that he found fascinating but had little meaning to Zero.He pointed out a tent, saying, That one is mine.As the chief of this clan I get the biggest and brightest abode made of the finest materials.Zero couldnt care less, but he acted like he was spellbound.Damon showed him a mean looking squirrel like creature with thick and sharp fangs and six legs, telling him it was his pet and also an endangered species because of the Beetars penchant for eliminating anything the Cogmores cared for.He introduced him to his sons and daughters, and their significant others, as well as those not directly related to him.Each time Zero said, Hello, to the passing Cogmores, they looked like they wanted to run and hide from him.He finally met Damons wife.That was uncomfortable.She wasnt as willing to let bygones be bygones.He and his kind had slaughtered her sons and daughters and she wasnt about to forgive and forget because the circumstances had changed.He apologized, but he was wasting his breath.They went back to Damons tent.He had to duck down to enter.Inside was a war room with maps and little figurines that represented each side.There were three severe looking Cogmores huddled around the map table, staring at it like it held a secret.Behind them was a modest bed and a lamp with little moldy old pamphlets scattered around it.When they saw him, they stood rooted to the spot like their muscles had seized, but because Damon had walked him in they didnt move to draw their weapons.Damon nodded to them, which must have meant that he was no threat.Then he said to the entire room: Before the Beetars arrived I had all kinds of luxuries.I had information at my fingertips via handheld devices.I had virtual reality games that would make your head spin.Youd forget who you were in those games within seconds.I had a nice home in a nice neighborhood, with kind neighbors and friends who would come over to laugh and play.That was a long time ago.I was just a boy when the Beetars arrived and took everything from us.They leveled anything higher than a single story, claiming we were congregating in higher buildings and using their size as a vantage point to spy on them and launch attacks.My house was one of the first to be razed to the ground.My own people did that to me and my family.We stood back and watched as fellow Cogmores destroyed our lives out of sheer cowardice and blind obedience to a higher power that could not be trusted.Now they dont even let us erect stone walls in fear that were scheming behind them.My dad was turned in as a traitor by his best friend and executed.My mom died of pneumonia, which would have never killed her before the Beetars had us living on the streets and starving to death.Most of my brothers and sisters were rounded up and sent off to work camps to farm.I never saw them again.Im the last of that clan, and Ill be damned if Im going to give up without a fight.It was quite an unnecessary speech, but Zero thought it was meant more for the other Cogmores in the room than it was meant for him.They were pumped up by the time he was done.One of them jabbed its finger at the map and said, We have to be careful.They could be watching from the skies.Damon said calmly, We wont be raiding their base.Zero here has told me its a trap.One of the others yelled, How can you trust one of those machines?Damon said, I thought it might be a trap, but Zero confirmed it.He says the Beetars plan to nuke it once theyre sure theyll get enough casualties.It makes sense.They mumbled to one another, but they soon came around.One guy said, If thats the case, what should we do?We need to force their hand.We need to stage a fake invasion so that they attack.Then theyll set up base somewhere else and we can ambush them.How can we stage an invasion?Zero knows where the cameras are mounted.He knows their surveillance limitations, so we can use them against them.Zero had not once offered the Cogmore his services.He did not know the surveillance weaknesses.But here he was, aiding the enemy.He wanted to say, No, and fly off into the sky, but he didnt.He was starting to think he was finally fighting for the side of righteousness.The Beetars would kill him if they caught him helping the Cogmores.Theyd probably have Henshaw flush his human husk out into space.But he had finally found a purpose that made sense to him.These people were fighting oppression and for the right to freedom.Just because hed been recruited to the other side didnt mean he personally stood against the Cogmores or what they fought for.He wondered if the others from base would feel the same way if they had all the information, or if theyd been so jaded by the constant attacks that there would never be peace.He was of two minds.The Beetars had never done anything to him to make him doubt their motives, but the Cogmores had.Theyd attacked him and kidnapped him.Maybe he had Stockholm syndrome.Or maybe he was finally learning about his place in the universe.It didnt matter how he felt, though, because more and more it seemed like he didnt have much choice in the matter.He asked if they were far enough away from the Beetar base to survive it being hit by a nuke, and everyone stopped chattering.They hadnt thought of that.Damon said, We could tunnel underground until the fallout dissipates.All Cogmore heads nodded.One of them said, Itll be easier if we dig up the tunnel we used to abduct him.He was pointing at Zero.Another added, It would go quicker if we asked him to do itnicely of course.Damon looked up at him and said sheepishly, It would go much faster if you did it.He sighed.Take me there and Ill get to work.He hadnt been expecting to be put to work, but it would seem that he was now an integral part of the Cogmore resistance.Theyd caved in the entire tunnel, but the rock and dirt were loose enough to easily move aside.Damon made an attempt to help him, but it was pathetic in comparison.Zero said to him, You have some strategizing to take care of.Ive got this.He expected Damon to hesitate because he didnt yet trust him, but he clapped him on the shoulder and said, Thank goodness you came into our lives, Zero.Ill be back soon.Let me know when you start getting tired.Zero smiled and then turned back around and dug like a machine as Damon walked away.Hed made it three hundred feet by the time Damon came back.The sun was going down and the outside of the tunnel was a mess of rocks and mountains of dirt.Damon looked weary from his time in the makeshift war room as he shouted Zeros name down the newly dug tunnel.He traipsed inside and looked around in amazement.Another hundred feet or so and this will do nicely.Zero propped against the wall and said, I could finish it up tonight.No.You need to rest.The sun will be down soon.If that battery you put in me really recharges itself, then I can work indefinitely.He looked at him sadly.You didnt have to help us.I know we didnt meet under the best of circumstances, and for that Im eternally sorry.Just know that Im very glad youre here.Zero opened his mouth to speak when a flash of light blinded him and a deafening boom reached his ears.A moment later the ground shook like an earthquake had hit.Then they felt the heat.That was when he knew what was happening.A nuclear device had been detonated, but closer to the Cogmore camp than to the Beetar base.It made no sense.Damon started to scream in agony as the heat blistered his skin.Luckily, they were enclosed in the tunnel, or the blast would have shredded them both.Zero grabbed Damon and shoved him to the ground.He covered him in a four foot high mound of loose dirt, then he stood between him and the mouth of the tunnel to try to deflect some of the intense heat.For Damons part, he didnt fight back as Zero buried him alive.The heat subsided, but before it was gone completely, another blinding flash and another boom occurred, this time closer.He felt his senses flicker, but his extra shielding kept his new battery and circuitry safe from the EMP bursts.One final blast caved the tunnel in.Zero stood in the dark until the ground stopped rumbling, then he dug a peephole to see if the attacks had subsided.After half an hour of silence and uninterrupted darkness, he dug a hole large enough to get out, and dug up Damon from where hed buried him alive.As he removed the dirt from his frail body, he worried what state hed find him in, but Damon was mostly fine besides some bleeding and blistering.Damon coughed and dark streams ran down his face from dirty tears.I need to go.I need to help the survivors.Zero led him from the tunnel.He walked ahead of him into camp.Already it was clear there were no survivors.There was nothing discernible where the campsite used to be.Damon wandered around anyway.He was a man lost.He stumbled and fell, stayed down and sobbed.His single eye twitched and the lid fluttered as fat streams of tears ran down his muddy face.If Zero had the ability to cry, he would have joined him.All the Cogmores hed met were now dead except for the wrecked old man at his feet.Damon had lost everything, a wife and countless daughters and sons, as well as his closest friends.Everything had been taken from him in a matter of a few minutes, including his cause.Zero hefted him up and said, We need to get you as far away from here as possible.The radiation is already killing you.I dont care.Your people did this.Are you a mole?Did they plant a homing beacon on you?How did this happen?He shook his head.This wasnt the plan.I dont know how they found you, but if they knew where I was, why didnt they rescue me before dropping the nukes?Because they have no decency or compassion.They probably looked at you as collateral damage.He was wrong.Volts and Eve wouldve intervened on his behalf.He had to believe they wouldnt let him get nuked without trying to help.He picked Damon up like a ragdoll and chucked him over his shoulder as he kicked and screamed to be let go.He wanted to stay and slowly die where his family had died, but Zero didnt have it in him to allow that.He started to jog away from the mushroom clouds.He had no idea what to do about Damons radiation poisoning.All he had were a smattering of memories of his dad talking about it when he was a boy and those memories were cloudy.He thought he remembered him mentioning baking soda, but he didnt have any.Damon probably needed to be put on an IV drip soon or hed puke and shit out all of the water in his system.He wasnt a doctor, so he was no help in that regard.But he knew if they stayed, Damons chances of survival would drop dramatically.That was his sole impetus in running as fast as he could away from the source of the radiation.The sun had risen with a vengeance.The day was hotter than the last, and that did not bode well for Damon.He had gone still as Zero walked through the desert.He needed to find him water or hed die before the day was over.Even with ample water, Zero didnt think hed make it.Hed received massive doses of radiation.With a body so small it was only a matter of time before he succumbed.Zero jumped and let his boosters carry him high into the sky, Damon clutched in a death grip so he wouldnt fall.He saw a shimmer in the distance and decided to investigate it.It looked like a pool of water, but as he closed in on it, it became clear that it was only a mirage.He slowly turned in the air, checking the horizon for any sign of liquid water.He saw a dark object fall from the clouds back where hed come from.It looked like a ship, and if so, there was still hope for him and for Damon.If his people came back for him, he had to make sure they found him.He pivoted in the direction of the camp and ripped through the air as fast as he could.The ship wasnt hard to find.The rest of the area had been bulldozed by multiple nuclear blasts.As he got close, he saw several flying objects zipping through the air.It took a full minute for him to realize they were his friends scouting the area.He sure hoped the ship had life support, or Damon wouldnt survive the flight.Then again, he wasnt even sure if they would be going up into space to join the Beetars or if theyd look for another place to set up base camp on the surface.The old camp would be condemned because of the radiation.The Beetars and Parsons would get sick there.Zero yelled, Hey!as loud as he could, and a mech swooped into view.It saw him and came at him fast, like it was going to attack, but when it got close it slowed down and dropped gently to its feet.It was Eve, and she had a puzzled look on her face.Is that you, Zero?He nodded.Thats impossible.The Cogmores abducted you almost a whole week ago.Theres no way your battery could hold out for so long.Its a miracle youre alive.They gave me a new battery.How did you survive the attack?I got lucky.That was very true.If hed been above ground during the strike hed be a pile of molten metal sizzling in the sun.Why are you carrying a dead Cogmore?He shook his head.Hes not dead.I saved him.He put Damon down gently.Damons mouth flopped open and his eyelid slid halfway shut.He checked for a pulse, checked for signs he was breathing.But Damon was already dead.Eve stared at him like hed lost his mind.He wanted to cry.He wanted to shout at the sky and shake his fist at God.He wanted to slap that look right off of Eves face.Instead he stood there and stared at his dead friend.He whispered, What are you doing here, then, if you thought I was already dead?Zero, we didnt know you were still here.If we had we wouldve tried to get you out before they dropped the nukes.Were the clean up crew.Were here to eliminate any stragglers, but it looks like the bombs took care of them all.He stared off into space.They were good people.She moved closer to look into his eyes.They were not.They attacked us mercilessly.You saw it with your own two eyes.Get a hold of yourself, man.And make sure you keep your newfound opinions to yourself.No one wants to hear that shit.She was right.Hed had a change of heart, but that didnt mean he could convince the others that his opposing opinion was the truth.What happens next?Whats the plan?She looked him up and down.First of all, you need to come up with a cover story.If you tell Parsons or the Beetars that the Cogmores messed with your battery and thats how you survived for so long without a charge, theyll assume they rigged you to blow up.In fact, Ill have Winthrop give you a once over before we head back up, just in case they planted explosives in you.He nodded.It was a fair assumption from her point of view.What happens after we head up?No one has told us yet.I think the Beetars will build a new base of operations, but so far they havent told us if thats the case or not.Just then, another mech appeared above them.It was Jackson.He swooped down and landed.He walked right up and looked at him incredulously.Zero, is that you?How the hell did you survive?Eve said, Give him some space.He just survived a nuclear holocaust.Jackson ignored her.He smiled when he saw Damon dead at his feet.How many of these little bastards did you kill?He sighed.He wanted to tell him the truth, but he was too far gone to reason with.The Cogmores had broken him beyond repair.He deflected by asking a question of his own.How did you guys know where to drop the nukes?I thought the plan was to evacuate the base and lure them in, and it looked like that had started to happen when their camp was targeted instead.That was the plan at first.It was a good plan.It was your plan, remember?But then when we evacuated base, we noticed a change in Hobbs.He started to get shifty.It looked like he wanted to jump ship.The little traitor was hiding something.So we got suspicious and interrogated him with violence until he broke.He told us he was working with the Cogmore resistance, and where they were camped.He was fidgety because we didnt give him enough warning before evacuating for him to get word back to the Cogmore base about our attack.What did the Beetars do to him when you told them he was a traitor?They sentenced him and his family to death.Well probably have to carry out their execution as soon as we get back.Zero had almost forgotten that the Beetars had Hobbs family in custody as a safety precaution.Their threats clearly hadnt worked.He made his mind up that he would have nothing to do with their executions.Eve said to Jackson, Zero needs a cover story.Apparently the Cogmores replaced his battery.Thats why hes still functional.We cant let the Beetars find out he was tampered with or they might not let him rejoin us.Jackson looked at him with barely hidden contempt.Why did you let them tamper with you?I didnt have a choice.Well, Eves right.We need to come up with a lie or the Beetars will leave you behind or shut you down.Theyll think the Cogmores booby trapped you.Eve added, We dont need to worry about getting caught in the lie.Theyll just have one of us open you up to confirm whatever story we concoct and we can lie about our findings.He felt like a child trying to hide a secret from a parent.Fine.Ill say whatever needs to be said.Winthrop and Kathy appeared together to the south.They hovered their way.Volts dropped down right next to him.Is that you, Zero?What the hell happened to you?Zero hugged him, partly because hed missed him, but also to shut him up.He was weary.He didnt need to keep answering the same questions over and over again.Winthrop landed and said, Theyre all dead.We wiped out the entire resistance.He cocked his head to the side.Is that Zero?He sighed and nodded.Winthrop checked him over to be sure the Cogmores hadnt rigged him to blow.He marveled at the new battery.Then Kathy came up with a cover story.It was weak, but it was the only one that seemed plausible.They would say the Cogmores discovered how to shut him down and they only reawakened him when they needed to interrogate him.He knew they could be shut down without losing their lives because Henshaw had done it to them before he shot them into orbit above Cogmore.He just didnt know how to do it, but he didnt have to know how in order to tell a convincing lie.Then they got aboard the ship and left the once inhabited nuclear wasteland.He wondered if the nuclear fallout would spread far enough to affect the crops.That would be an embarrassing backfire.Volts kept staring at him as they ascended through the cloud layer.He said, Its good to have you back, man.Its good to be back, he lied.He was glad to be reunited with Volts and Eve, but he wasnt happy to be working for the Beetars again.At least he had hope once more.Hed come full circle, but with a new, tarnished perspective.He closed his eyes and tried to remember his humanity.The best he could come up with was recalling Staceys face, but he couldnt do it.Hed only seen her human form once, and that was so fleeting and seemed so long ago that he just couldnt do it.He wondered how she was doing.He wondered if Piss pants was driving her nuts.He wondered if hed ever see her again.Jackson yelled, Well rendezvous with the orbiter in twenty two minutes.Im going to get some shut eye until then.Volts eagerly said, Me too.Zero wanted to go offline too, but now that he was using a new power source, he didnt think he could anymore.He plugged the charging port into his back and nothing happened.Eve smiled.I guess you dont need that anymore.She thought that would make him happy, but she was wrong.He yearned to shut down.He needed the peace.He smiled back anyway.Its a lonely feeling to be the only sad person in a group, but its even lonelier when the group finds out youre sad and tries to jolly you out of it.He rested his head against the wall and tried his best to acclimate to his new surroundings.The vision of Damons tiny blistered body crept into his thoughts.He had inadvertently led to his demise and the demise of everyone he loved.He was a monster among monsters.He tried to shake the thoughts from his head, but they were too fresh to be sloughed off so easily.He avoided eye contact as he fought his internal demons.He had to get a grip before he met with Parsons or hed start to ask questions that he did not want to answer.He had to put on a convincing act for the Beetars too.They docked with the Beetar ship and he helped unplug the charging mechs.They filed out into a large open ship with alien markings and alien interior design.The walls and floors were shiny and black, which made it nearly impossible to judge depth.He stumbled twice before getting his bearings.Lights illuminated the area from sources unknown.Parsons met them wearing a radiation suit.No way!Is that Zero?He stepped forward.Yep.I survived.He looked him up and down.To the others he said severely, You should have told me about him before bringing him aboard the ship.For all we know hes been stuffed full of explosives.Winthrop said, Were not stupid.We checked him over.Hes clean.Zero said sarcastically, Well, Im happy to be here too.Parsons smirked.Come with me.I need you to debrief me on what happened to you down there.If I dont like your story, you cant stay.Parsons led him to an oversized office with odd furnishings and even stranger technology.By way of an explanation he said, This was designed for Beetars.I dont know what any of this crap does and the chair hurts my ass.He pointed at a huge chair and said, Take a seat but dont break it.He sat down and Parsons ran a Geiger counter up and down his body.It beeped continuously, meaning Parsons had to keep the suit on while in his presence.He didnt ask how Zero had survived the EMP so Zero didnt offer an explanation.Parsons sat down and asked, What happened to you?Zero told him the entire story, with the little twists necessary to keep him from kicking him off the ship.He left out that hed started to change his mind about the Cogmores.He left out that he had sort of befriended their leader, their sworn enemy.He also failed to mention that he was now more energy efficient since he was running on Cogmore batteries that somehow recharged themselves.It took all of his will to refrain from asking him why no one had come looking for him.When he was done, Parsons paused for a minute to gather his thoughts and finally said, Youre very lucky.Lets go join the others.I have some exciting news.Ill have Winthrop check you over again just to be sure youre safe.He stood up and said, Follow me.He walked behind as Parsons led the way down one black, oily looking corridor after another.Parsons said, This is an observation ship, but it doubles as a failsafe in case the Beetars ever get overrun on the ground.They can escape up here and wait for reinforcements to arrive.Its in geostationary orbit above their ground base.Zero didnt really care.He was more interested in this news hed mentioned.He turned a corner and the others were there standing around inside a cavernous room with poor lighting.He took a place among them and Parsons faced them all.The Beetars are running sweeps right now, but they think the resistance on Cogmore is no more.If theyre right, then some of you may get reassigned.Thats good news, because anywhere is better than here.It was good news.The thought of going back to Cogmore put a weight in his heart.To Winthrop he said, Check Zero over with a fine toothed comb.I want to know if a single wire is out of place.Winthrop said, Yes, sir.To him he said, Follow me, Zero.He followed Winthrop down corridors with thick atmosphere and poor lighting until they got to a room that was just full of tools and various gadgets.Im not really going to do a thorough check.Ill give you a once over to satisfy Parsons.I already know how different you really are.That last line made him feel like a weirdo, but Winthrop was right.He was different.Winthrop took him apart, stared at his components, and then fastened his plates back up.They went back to the cavernous common area when enough time had passed.Eve had yanked two recharging ports from the walls and was busy wiring them together.Winthrop asked, What are you doing?Youll get in trouble.Ill say it was an accident.Im wiring these together so one end can go into Zero and the other can plug into one of us.That way we can use Zero as a mobile charger.Zero said, We dont need that, though.We have chargers.She looked at Volts and said, While you were gone, Volts had a panic attack when they wouldnt let him plug in two or three times a day.I kept telling him he can hold a charge just fine now, but old habits die hard.This is more of a security blanket for that big baby.Volts glared at her, but he didnt stop her from doing it, or from mocking him.Zero asked if that would work.I dont see why not.She finished up, then coiled the wires in a loop, and with Winthrops help stuffed them inside her chest cavity so Parsons wouldnt find out what shed done.Volts smoothed over the walls where the ports had been pulled so that it was only obvious theyd been removed if someone knew what they were looking for.He finished up when Parsons and three Beetars appeared before them.The Beetars looked concerned, but Parsons looked like he wanted to jump for joy.That mustve meant they were going to be stationed somewhere more hospitable.The largest Beetar was also the bluest of the bunch.Its eyes took them all in as it stepped forward with a handheld tablet in its hand.It read from the screen.The oldest units here are David Jackson, Michael Freeman, Winthrop Jones, and Katherine Jasper.You will be stationed on the human corporation planet.This is an easy assignment, granted to you as a thank you from us for all of your hard work and diligent service.Kathy whooped with joy and hugged Winthrop.Jackson said to Mike, We made it.Its time to take it easy for a while.The din died down and the blue Beetar continued, Eve, Zero, and Volts are the newest units.You will be given a special privilege that few have ever been granted.Its a harder assignment, but not by much.Youll be stationed on one of our warships that has been coming under increasing fire from an unknown enemy.The ship needs reinforcements, and I thought you three would do nicely.I understand two other units from your training class are already there, so youll be in good company.Volts said to Eve, Were going to see Piss pants again.Jackson looked like he wanted to comment on the name, but he refrained.Zero would get to see Stacey again.He didnt know how he got so lucky, but despite all hed been through, things were starting to work out.The Beetar put its device away and said, The resistance has been eliminated thanks to your suggestion.He pointed at Zero.Weve detected no more movement from that area, and all other Cogmore citizens are accounted for.You have won us a reprieve from their attacks, quite possibly forever.Parsons will stay behind with us to train the new arrivals coming in the next month, but as far as we can tell, they wont be necessary.We have finally civilized those people after all this time.Zero couldnt help himself.You mean subdued, right?Youve finally subdued them into blind servitude.Theres a difference between civilizing a race and subjecting them to your rule.Parsons stepped forward and yelled, Hold your tongue, soldier.The Beetar waved Parsons off and calmly said, I dont know what youve been told about the Cogmores, but your version of reality is wrong.They were destroying themselves and their planet when we intervened.We managed to revive one of the few crops that will even grow down there anymore, and in exchange for a percentage of their harvest we provide sustenance, medical aide, and a structure they can build upon.Now he was confused.The Beetar seemed sure of its story, and it made some sense.Maybe Damon had lied to him, or maybe he had his facts skewed.Then again, the Beetar might just be a convincing liar.Or more likely: both stories were partially true.Maybe the Beetars did intervene, but without being asked to do so.And in exchange maybe they expected some of the harvests, whether the Cogmores liked it or not.Maybe both sides were in the dark about how events had unfolded.Because he didnt know what else to say, he said, I understand.Im sorry for speaking out of turn.Its understandable.You were there for just a short amount of time and you saw many terrible things.And worse than that, none of my people walked any of you through the history of our struggles on Cogmore.Parsons seemed to relax.The Beetar stared at Zero with its overlarge black eyes and said, We should have eased you into things on Cogmore.We should have been more transparent, and for that we are sorry.But thats in the past now.Just know that we have your best interests at heart.Now that sounded like a lie, but he kept quiet because hed already caused too much turmoil with his mouth.He nodded so he didnt have to speak.The Beetar said, General Parsons will get you all ready for your new assignments.It was an honor working with each and every one of you.It turned and walked away with the other two Beetars following in its wake.Parsons waited for a full minute before hissing, You almost ruined it for everyone, Zero.The Beetars are a benevolent race, but theres a limit to how much shit theyll take.Im sorry I spoke.Shut up.Mike, Jackson, Kathy and Winthrop, you guys can follow me.The corporate planet is located at the next nearest star system.Theres a ship waiting for you.Itll get you there in a few weeks.Jackson said, Good.I can catch up on my beauty sleep.Mike slapped him and said, Youll need about three weeks of it before my eyes stop burning every time I look at you.Parsons said to the rest of them, Ill get your ship prepped to rendezvous with the warship.Stay put until then.Then he walked from the room.Jackson hugged Eve and Volts and then he shook Zeros hand.Apparently theyd all become good friends while he was in Cogmore custody.Kathy gave him a hug, but the others just said Goodbye, before chasing after Parsons.Volts waited until they were all gone before saying to Zero, I doubted your story about the Cogmores, but after hearing that stream of bullshit come out of that Beetars ugly mouth, I think I believe you now.That had him confused, because the Beetars speech had had the opposite effect on him, actually convincing him of Beetar righteousness.Eve said, It doesnt matter what we think.We just need to do our time and get through this for the payoff at the end.Volts nodded.She was right.They had to move forward to their eventual destinygetting their minds back inside their bodies.Zero almost bought into his own denials, but then he heard a Cogmore voice call out for help from down the corridor.He excused himself from his friends, saying he needed to stretch his legs, which was silly, but they didnt argue.He followed the sound of the distressed Cogmores voice until he came to a door.When he opened it he saw five little Cogmores huddled together, crying behind bars.A Cogmore stood up and approached the bars.The double agent.Hobbs.He spat at Zero.Zero said in his weird Cogmore voice, Im so sorry for what has happened to you.Hobbs stepped back suspiciously.What is this?Is this another twisted trick?How do you know my language?Its in my database.It was programmed into me.Im a living creature inside this mechanical body and my body was upgraded.Hobbs looked him over.I did not know you things were alive.The rebellion has been thwarted.Your leader and his clan are dead.I know.They made me watch the explosions from up here.That was awful.Hobbs family would be executed for his betrayal.At least he would not be required to carry out their sentences, since no one had mentioned it since they arrived.The Beetars probably wanted to do it personally.Zero asked, Why do your people hate Beetars so much?The curiosity had him by the tail and would not let go.He was starting to understand that the situation between the Cogmores and the Beetars was not black and white by any means, and he was curious about the nuances involved.Buying into both diametrically opposed ideals had his head spinning.A straight answer would set his mind at ease.But Hobbs did not supply it.Hobbs sighed.They were our friends and now they are not.Just because they are allies with you doesnt mean that alliance will last forever.Be careful with them.They cant be trusted.As soon as they cant exploit you with your willing participation, they will subject their rule upon you like they did to my people.Zero nodded, still wondering who to trust.Hobbs said, Let me out.Zero gasped.It hadnt even crossed his mind.How could they escape from orbit aboard an enemy vessel?I cant.Theyll kill me.You have to.Youve killed innocents.Now you will purge your guilt by releasing us.The way he said it, so forcefully and direct, had Zero convinced.He did have to do something to help.He couldnt just let them die.What would you do if I sprung you free?Wed grab a shuttle and get back to our people.Wed start a new uprising.He pondered his options.His mind screamed for him to turn on his heels and close the door behind him, to forget the entire conversation, but he couldnt do that now that Hobbs had confronted him.He had to help, if he could do so discreetly.He didnt want to get caught and he certainly didnt want Volts and Eve to get punished along with him, so he had to formulate a plan to free Hobbs that ensured his involvement would never be discovered.Because he was no sleuthing genius, he came up with the simplest plan that struck him.Ill bust the lock on this cage, but you have to assure me that youll wait to escape.Me and my friends are leaving this ship soon.Wait until after weve left to make your move.That way itll look like you broke free on your own.Hobbs nodded.Its the least I can do.He wanted to trust him, because he had to trust him.His life depended on Hobbs doing what he asked.He grabbed the door and pulled.The lock crackled and finally snapped loose as the door opened.He pushed the door back into place and said, Wait until you hear our ship take off.Promise me.I promise.Thank you.He walked from that holding cell with a heavy heart, but also with a hefty dose of fear coursing through him.He was not normally the trusting type, but he had to trust Hobbs to do the right thing.He felt a cathartic wave wash over him.He had executed Cogmores in cold blood, and it was his plan that had destroyed their only rebellion.But by helping Hobbs, that single act could be the start of a rebellion that would break the shackles of Beetar tyranny for good.At least that was his hope.Or Hobbs could get impatient and doom them all.He just had to wait and see how it played out.He returned to his friends and played it cool.Luckily, they didnt ask him any questions.Eve said, I wonder whos been attacking the warship were going to?Volts snorted.They cant be any worse than those damn Cogmores.Zero wanted to speak up for the Cogmores, but considering what hed just done, he thought it prudent to keep quiet.Before the conversation could gain strength, the floor shuddered, meaning the ship carrying Jackson, Mike, Kathy, and Winthrop had just left.He was going to miss them despite their flaws, or perhaps because of them.Parsons came jogging into the room and said breathlessly, Your ship is ready.The journey will only take two days because the warships going to meet you halfway.I stowed all the ammo youll need on board.Come on.His eyes were red and puffy like hed been crying, which Zero realized was probably the case.Hed wept as he launched the others towards the corporation run planet.Zeros virtual heart was fluttering in his metal chest for various reasons.It was only a matter of time before the prisoners escaped, and he could only hope they did so silently and peacefully.He didnt want Parsons to get caught in the crossfire.But also he was going to board a genuine warship in space captained by an alien race.And he was about to be reunited with Stacey.He sure hoped she was as excited at the prospect as he was.He could barely contain himself as he followed Parsons through the corridors.They bowed as they passed a Beetar.He acted like they didnt even exist despite the fact that any one of them could have squeezed the juice out of him like a tube of toothpaste.Even Parsons couldve taken him.His arrogance did worry him, though.What if the warship was teeming with guys like that?The shuttle was small, but large enough to fit them all in snugly.This was it.If Hobbs could wait just another minute, hed be in the clear for the escape.Parsons teared up as he bade them farewell.Zero impatiently hissed, Hurry up, man.This ship isnt going to launch itself.Parsons wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and exited without saying another word.A second later the ship came to life as a hatch in the Beetar ship opened up.They floated towards the black, and once they were far enough away, they shot off.Volts said, That was too harsh.Hes a good guy.I know that.He studied the concerned look Volts was giving him, so he decided to come clean.
