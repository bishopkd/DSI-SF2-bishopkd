No one was born outside of Leiben, despite the furthest research center, the Terminator Hub, distancing more than 8000 kilometers from the city.Thus when someone was asked where one was from, one never answered with his place of birth.That was a privilege reserved only for those who had actually grown up in the city.There were many reasons why all births took place in Leiben, all having been duly explained to Toni in high school.He remembered only the most important one, however.The fact was that human births in a Capicuan atmosphere sometimes tended to get a little complicated.As a result, almost half of Leibans Central Hospital Complex consisted of a very well financed and equipped Pediatric and Obstetrics Departments, and possessed a maternity ward entirely sealed in a low carbon dioxide atmosphere.Despite most newborns having inherited exogenous genes rendering them impervious to the quasi poisonous atmosphere, every once in a while a baby would pop out without said genes having been correctly expressed, or even missing them entirely, thus becoming fully dependent on the maternity wards artificial atmosphere until the problem was corrected.Then there was the case of the naturals, like those of his fathers family.The Miuras did not believe in genetic manipulation, preferring to place their faith in the proverbial hands of natural selection.Which was foolish, Toni thought.His father had lived for several years in the hospital, his lungs forced to gradually adapt to successively higher concentrations of CO2 until, at age six, he had finally been rolled outside for his first look at the wider world.He had at the time been small, skinny and very fragile.It had taken him another eight years to get rid of the oxygen mask.YO TARDY, WERE WAITINFOR YA!Toni heard a familiar voice roar.There were a few sniggers across the room and Toni shook the image of his fathers emaciated form out of his mind, realizing that the entire classroom was staring at him.He glanced forwards, only to find the Lieutenant sitting silently, expressionless except for a pair of slowly rising eyebrows.Oh!Toni exclaimed, and hastily he stood.Toni Miura, eighteen, raised on Mushima farm, Leiben district, uh, Im also here to be a Hammer driver!he declared, not managing to state it quite as stylishly as Ray had.Nevertheless, as he sat down, his friend gave him a confident thumbs up sign along with a whispered alright!Hannah Arakaki, I come from the Northern Wetlands Conservation Hub and Im eighteen years old.Oh, and Im here cause my dad said it would be good for me.The person speaking behind him was also familiar.It was the femme known as Happyface and, unsurprisingly, she was smiling again.It was a mystery how Hannah had managed to be admitted to Suit Instruction training.Yet there she was, smiling as if she was there merely in passing, and that in only a few minutes she would be sharing coffee and biscuits with the base commander himself.He supposed that maybe that was her secret.He didnt know whether it was confidence or sheer naivety that propped up her attitude, but somehow the northerner had managed to coast along just fine over the course of the last two weeks.Sueli Cassel, Im twenty years old and I come from the North Thaumantias Research Hub.I joined so I can do this for a living, sir, the third and last of the platoons femmes stated.Sueli could not have been better seated, having claimed the front desk ahead and to Tonis right, allowing him to easily gaze at the contour of her features without drawing attention to himself.Sueli was at the moment the principal star in his nighttime fantasies, although he suspected he wasnt the only one with an eye on her.The introductions proceeded steadily, Toni taking care to occasionally interrupt his stream of thoughts to take note of the progress.He didnt want to be harassed by the Screamer again, and indeed the bastard glowered at him every once in a while, as if suspecting that he wasnt paying attention.When the last recruit had introduced himself, the lieutenant set off explaining the rules and regulations on base.They were handed several summarized documents, with choice articles of law underlined and minute annotations referring them to yet other choice articles.Lieutenant Templeton skimmed over the rules, pausing several times to ask whether there were doubts or questions, never showing anger in having to explain things more than once.By the time every document had been handed out and every line of text read aloud, more than two hours had elapsed.Toni couldnt say for sure how long it had been, since the only recruit permitted to carry a watch was Ian.He found it odd how the lieutenant had asked Ian to introduce himself; they were obviously related and probably knew each other very well.Yet it made sense if one took into consideration the platoon leaders apparent nature.The LT certainly didnt seem the type to play favorites.The lieutenant finally rapped his fist on one of the desks before him, beckoning all to quiet down.There is one last thing I would like to say before we end this class, and it regards the gentlemans agreement that may be celebrated between a platoon and its drill team, he dclared.As you may have noticed, the Disciplinary Code weve been studying, he raised the thick blue book in his hand, clarifies that just about every infraction will result in administrative punishment.Although during your training no disciplinary infraction will survive to be a part of your permanent record, certain violations will get you kicked out of the MEWAC without chance of return.However, should we celebrate the pact I just referred to, some screw ups, if not too serious, may be resolved in a non administrative manner.The pact that I propose is thus: That if someone here were to get out of line, and I or our sergeant were to propose our own punishment for the error, said person would accept the punishment and carry it out without complaint, and without telling anyone from outside this subunit about it.The advantage for the Drill Team is that we can then be more selective about who gets to be kicked out and who doesnt.The advantage for you is obvious: so that you might avoid getting booted out of the MEWACs SIC.If we believe you deserve it, I should add.So what do you say?he finished.There was a general murmur of consent, although a few glanced nervously at their drill sergeant as they did so.As for Mason, he kept his attention firmly fixed on Toni.He seemed to be trying to say something with his eyes.Toni kept his head safely lowered and stared at the edge of his redwood desk.On ya feet!Mason barked.Sixteen chairs scraped against the floor and all stood at attention beside their desks, awaiting the order to file out.Class was then dismissed for the morning, and lunch awaited them at the base canteen.*****      Damned if the Screamer doesnt have a boner for you, man!Ray laughed as they waited in line.As with all buildings on base, the canteen was a low set construction, bone white in color except for its roof, which was a dull green.What set it apart was its wide one piece smoked window, which doubled as a gigantic data screen.What showed on the screen usually depended on the mood of the shift officer of the day.Some liked to play images from previous courses, the recruits thus being forced to watch as some unfortunate predecessor got his ass handed to him in combat training.Some more administrative types liked to present slide shows of the military virtues, along with inspiring images of men and woman in impeccable uniforms.Courage, discipline, loyalty, etcetera.The only shift officer whose use of the data screen seemed appropriate to Toni was Lieutenant Templeton himself.The day before yesterday, the entire base had been treated to old Earth wildlife documentaries.At breakfast, they had found themselves watching a golden sun, quite different from their own, rising from the African highveld to the soft sound of shakuhachi flute.Lunchtime had been a succession of hunting sequences, focusing mainly on the ferocious feline as it pounced on the endearingly unsuspecting herbivore.It had been interesting to note who rooted for which side as they enjoyed their steak and liver meal.Toni had sided with the predators, of course.Dinnertime had bestowed upon them a medley of gorgeous sunsets, accompanied afterwards by images of nocturnal wildlife with a starry sky as the backdrop.Today, however, the data screen displayed a rolling message informing all present that, at the end of the previous week, a member of the Foot Infantry Battalion had been found guilty of sleeping in the course of sentinel duty, having as a result been sentenced to a public verbal reprimand and reduction of his Behavior Classification.The shift officer, an ageing captain with a heavy gut and soft, lazy eyes, watched the advancing procession closely, gauging the recruits level of interest at the public service announcement.Must work in the Justice and Discipline Department, Toni thought.Apparently he was not the sort to strike gentleman agreements with his quarry.He wondered whether Stick had been the punished soldier.Yo ...Toniquita, did you hear me, man?Ray asked loudly, tapping a finger against his skull as if to hint at his friends lack of sanity.A smile tugged at the corner of Tonis mouth.Ray had a habit of ridiculously pimping up everyones names.I heard you.I saw him give you the evil eye back in class, too.What was that about?Arent you two supposed to come from the same neighborhood, or something?Ray laughed.Thats exactly why he hates my guts, man.Its a neighborhood thing.My father hates the asshole.Thinks hes a prick, though I cant imagine why.Even said so to Masons face once.Got into a fight with him cause of it.Now Mason hates my pa, which means he hates me by association, get it?Which means were both fucked, mate, he finished, laughing as he was handed a plateful of chicken stew.So who won the fight?Toni asked.Ever seen my pa?he retorted, apparently offended at having been asked.No.If you had, youd know who, he declared boldly before carrying on.Whats your pa like?What?Hes, uh, hes CO2 intolerant.Has a lot of problems with that.Works in agriculture   Plantations?Ray asked with interest.Only recently got into pulp production.Mostly we work with livestock.Toni felt uncomfortable with the conversation, as if his fathers beliefs would somehow shoulder they way through his words and declare themselves to all nearby.You know there are treatments for that, dont you?His condition is pretty serious, alright?Toni answered testily.Ahuh, thats cool, man ...Whats cool?Is it edible?Gordie asked as he bit deeply into a chicken leg.They took their seats opposite him on a solid canteen table reserved for recruits.Gordon Winters, formerly known as Scarybrow, more recently christened Gordie by his comrades, was nearing the end of his meal, but he attacked the last scraps of food with the same gusto others usually reserved for their first bites.His solid physique was testament to his appetite, although all knew that there was more than fat attached to his frame.His time on the Click had been the fourth fastest.Mind your own business, or all youre gonna eat is my boot!Ray threatened with mock hostility, receiving a smack on his crown for his trouble.The Leibenese winced at the pain, but didnt seem to mind Gordies quick retort.I was talking about my father.He works with livestock.Oh, is that right?Mines in the North Thau cavalry.Had me a little late, hell be retiring next year.Gordie suddenly leaned forwards, his lunch safely tucked away, and whispered to them.Did you hear about Ian being the LTs nephew?What?Toni and Ray exclaimed at the same time.Got that from a footie last night.Can you believe they just put a Templeton in command of a Templeton?Damn, there should be a law against that, he said, discreetly ensuring that the subject of their discussion was still sitting at the tables other end.After two weeks in the same casern, their most senior fellow recruit still remained an unknown quantity to them.Ian had a poker face to match his verbal reserve, and kept a wall up as if he were somehow in stiff competition with his fellow recruits.Toni suspected that perhaps that was true, but still found the attitude fundamentally disrespectful.Either way, Ian maintained a force field that to date had resisted all attempts to breach it.Ray was game for the conversation.No surprise he ended up senior then.Dyou know what else?According to regulations, until they find a corporal for the Drill Team, Ian will have to assist for them, he whispered conspiratorially.No one would put a recruit in a Drill Team.I think ...Gordie seemed surprised at the information, but Toni suspected that Ray was right.Dont hunch together like that, guys, you look like youre planning a coup or something, Hirum whispered in mock conspiracy over their shoulders before settling down beside Gordie.Hirum was, like Toni, still called by his first name only because nobody had as yet found a more appropriate handle for him.A native of North Thau, the youngest son of a pair of researchers, Hirum was about as tall as Gordie, despite possessing only half his shoulder width.Watching the two, Toni found the contrast amusing.Gordie seemed to sit taller only because his well padded rear offered him a height advantage over his comrade.Hirum was also the youngest of the platoon, and would be turning eighteen in six months.Speaking softly but still wearing his sly grin, he continued.So, let me guess.Youre talking about the promotion, arent you?he deduced with a snicker.Even if its true, its still no promotion, dammit.Hes only a recruit, no more than any one of us.If it happens at all, it will only be a temporary responsibility, Gordie hissed.Besides Ray, he was the eldest of the platoon, at twenty two.Then why did the Screamer call him aside like that?When did this happen?Toni asked, finding sudden interest in the conversation.Oh, you didnt know?I was in the bathroom when the Screamer found me.I thought Id done something wrong, but he just told me to find Ian and tell him to see the Sarge in the Instructors Cabin immediately.So I did just that, he finished.And what did Ian say?Ray breathed as he put on his I told you so expression.Didnt say a word.He just nodded like he was expecting it, or something, and left.The group digested the news for a moment.If he tries order me around, Ill fuck him up!Ray finally burst out, rubbing his knuckles dramatically for effect.No, you wont, Gordie retorted with a frown.They had already received warnings from the senior soldiers on base.Drill Teams tended to severely punish their platoons for transgressions committed by any constituent.No one was keen on discovering whether this was true or not.Youll see, Ray said quietly.He seemed to be about to say something else, but then Toni noticed Ian walking towards them.Quiet, guys.Incoming, he whispered.Gordies suddenly innocent expression and Hirums anxious one amused Toni, but he kept the grin off his face as Ian came to a halt before them.The senior recruit gave the group a curt nod before speaking.Guys, I need you to spread the word.Were to form up at ten to fourteen hundred.We need to have a talk.*****      It was ten to fourteen hundred and the platoon was not formed up.Ray had seen to that.In actual fact, all within earshot when Ian had spoken in the canteen had seen to that.But it was Ray who had presented his fellow recruits with an ironclad excuse to disobey him.Before long, the haughty Leibenese was standing at the caserns front steps, calling out to his fellow casern mates like a politician trying to improvise a press conference.Is that how it is?Any Joe comes out of nowhere and says hey, your commander says Im in charge, so Ill be giving the orders now, and we just accept that?We were with the Lieutie one hour ago, and he said nothing about this!Why the sudden change?he demanded as recruits encircled him.Toni felt uneasy about Rays method of resistance.Nevertheless, he stood staunchly beside his new friend as the Leibenese argued his case.Hirum loitered anxiously beside the parade ground, clearly prepared to form up at a moments notice, as if being the first to do so would somehow spare him from the anticipated blowback.Gordie only shook his head and kept to himself, apparently just as convinced as Toni that there would be hell to pay if the drill team were to find the platoon at odds with itself.Some recruits kept glancing about apprehensively as if expecting their sergeant to show up any moment, sniffing the air like a police dog that had caught the scent of narcotics.Masons particular charisma had somehow turned him into an omnipresent entity.Ray, dont forget what we decided.We form up at five to.And thats not too far off now ...Toni reminded him in an undertone.Ray shook his head as if he was being troubled by a fly.Ian approached quietly then and leaned close the tense recruit before speaking softly into his ear.A wicked grin stretched over Rays face and he gave a purposeful nod, and the two turned and entered the casern with a mystified Toni in tow.The tension between the pair as they entered their sleeping quarters began to alarm Toni.He was suddenly reminded of the first time he had accompanied his father to the slaughterhouse they kept on the farm.His father had had nothing to say at the time, except for a brief explanation on how to use the captive bolt pistol to euthanize swine cleanly.Toni had pulled the trigger on the last hog himself, and he had since put an end to many a critter that way.But he had never witnessed a physical act of violence between two human beings.Ian and Ray squared off in the open area opposite to the doorway, with only Toni, Gordie and a fearful but inquisitive Hirum as witnesses.Ray seemed fearless.He smiled at his senior.You sure you want a piece of May 23rd, Ian?At the sound of his name Ian bolted forwards, prompting a surprised Ray to swing wildly while backing up, missing his target.Ian fell on him with a vicious head butt, followed by a knee to the stomach.As Ray doubled over, hugging his gut, Ian pulled violently at the back of his shirt, causing buttons to pop out all the way up to Rays collar.He then wrapped the cloth around his opponents head and began to unceremoniously knee him there while holding the shirt in place.There was something mechanical and unforgiving about the way Ian broke Rosa down.Ray swung out blindly at first, hugging Ians waist alternately with each arm, apparently not realizing how near his opponent was to him.Ian kneed him mercilessly in the gut, repeating the act like an aerobic exercise until his quarry began to feel the pain and hugged his torso.Ian then promptly began to knee him in the head.Thunk!Thunk!Thunk!Toni made to intervene, only to be held back by a grim Gordie.After a while, Ian began to tire.The recruit finally pinned Ray against the wall and unwrapped his head, peeling off the bloody shirt as if he were unwrapping a gruesome gift.He leaned close to Rays blooded and battered face.Had enough?he asked, almost whispering.Yes ...a hoarse voice replied.Ian released Rays body and it slid down onto its knees.Appalled and horrified, Toni tried to approach his fallen friend, but Ian blocked his path and gave him a frosty look.Let me get to him ...Toni said quietly.Im not done with you, Ian replied just as quietly.The calm statement set off every alarm bell in Tonis head, and he tensed up just as Ians boot whizzed up to clip him smartly over the head.Toni backed up, reeling from the glancing blow as warm blood began to stream down the side of his face.Ian rushed him at a sprint and, leaping into the air, he pumped his leg out, hammering it into Tonis chest with a resonating thump.Before the pain reached Toni brain, however, he captured Ians boot and kicked him stiffly in the crotch.The sound of the impact itself wasnt impressive, but it was more than compensated for by Hirums audible gasp.Ian stood there for a moment, his right leg held in his opponents firm embrace, his left one shivering, and for a moment Toni feared that his senior still had some fight in him.The blonde then sank to the floor and silently assumed a fetal position.Hirum discreetly took his leave from the casern.Moments later, Gordie left with the unpleasant task of tracking down the Drill Team.As Toni collapsed onto a bed, blood dripping steadily down his chin, breathing in painful gasps while he stared at Ians trembling body, he realized that hed just given the Screamer precisely what he wanted.FIVE      MEWAC  SIC installations, 14H15, 22nd of January, 2771      I find myself unable to stress enough how unacceptable your behavior was, Lieutenant Templeton said solemnly.I briefly considered making a reference to the military virtues, but I think Ill give them a rest for now.I will say is this, however.There are three things a soldier must learn before he can become a functional member of his unit.Firstly, the soldier must learn how to do.To do the things that are expected of a soldier.Fight, eat, shower, make his bed, wipe his ass, and so on.Secondly, the soldier must learn how to learn.To learn how to discipline his mind so as to accept newfound knowledge more easily and understand how to exploit it.All this means nothing, however, if one hasnt first learned how to be!How to exist in this institution, to respect its traditions, its constituents and its laws!You have both failed in this third lesson, and that is why you will be punished.Recruits Toni Miura and Ian Templeton, You are both found guilty of behavior unbecoming, and are hereby sentenced to go into orbit for a period of no less than three days from the end of this hour.If either of you return to ground before the end of that period, these events will become known to Captain Damien, who may then decide on what is in the best interests of this subunit, the lieutenant finished in a monotone.Despite Masons best efforts, Lieutenant Templeton had adamantly decided that no one would be taking the Walk on their first day of training.Ray had been whisked off to Medical Bay and, after a cursory examination from the orderly, redirected via ambulance to Leiben CHC.Oddly enough, he suffered no consequences besides what had already befallen him in the casern.By MEWAC tradition, to go into orbit simply meant that, for the period of allotted time, in no way could any part of the convicted recruits body touch the ground.The only way that such a feat could be accomplished was if the condemned was carried around all day by his fellow platoon members.Drill instruction, physical training, weapons training, civil and military moral studies, signals, topography, vigilance and counter vigilance, camouflage, eating, drinking, defecating, showering, sleeping, every single daily task, including dressing and undressing himself, would be executed as he was held aloft by his mates.The lieutenant had chosen not to go into detail as to how that should be accomplished; they were apparently expected to figure it out for themselves.But he had solemnly informed his subordinates that, it being a most important tradition, the local base inhabitants would be unusually informative in the event of any cheating taking place.Moreover, surprise inspections would be used as a means to ensure compliance with the sentence.Mason beamed delightedly, having apparently discovered hog heaven.As anticipated, the punishment turned out to be just as agonizing for the platoon members as it was for Toni.The days that followed proved surreal.The entire canteen would burst into delighted applause every time he and Ian were carried in, as if celebrating virgins being offered up for pagan sacrifice.Figures moved silently in a darkened casern as six platoon members relieved another group holding a snoring Toni aloft, said recruit diligently faking his slumber.He slept almost not at all in those nights, discomforted as he was with the notion of resting while his mates were in effort.Ian did not share his concern, although every time he fell asleep, one of the recruits holding him up would give him a stiff shake.Empathy for their senior had died on that Monday, a state of affairs that Ian made no effort to correct.The showering arrangements proved particularly harassing for Toni.In their first attempt, his complement had attempted to simply hold him up as he showered, the effort proving impossible due to the shower heads being set too low.The solution they finally decided upon proved feasible but profoundly embarrassing.A loudly complaining Gordie held a naked Toni under the shower as if they were newly weds, an amused Hirum armed and ready with soap and shampoo.Nothing, however, came close to the complications surrounding use of the latrine.Toni made every effort to avoid the scenario, eating as sparingly as possible in an attempt to last the three days in orbit without evacuating.The pressure, however, soon began to accumulate, and before long his platoon members were groaning at the impending prospect.Mason took pains to personally inspect the procedure, striving to ensure that Tonis buttocks at no moment touched the toilet seat, his mates going so far as to dismantle the toilet stall nearest the bathroom entrance to make room for three.No words were immediately available to describe Tonis shame.The remaining MEWAC personnel, however, had no difficulty in describing the episode to the uninformed over beers at the local bar.Toni somehow managed to keep up with the training.More importantly, he came to understand that if at any time his fellow recruits had gotten tired of the punishment, they needed only have dropped Toni to the ground before Masons feet.The consequences would only have been his and Ians to suffer.Yet such a thing never happened.Tonis feet touched down amid much fanfare a full seventy two hours after entering orbit, and training suddenly became that much easier for the remainder of the week.By the beginning of the second week, however, the pace of activity had begun to accelerate.Each recruit was distributed a veritable pharmacopeia of compulsory medication, beginning with Ultarine, a selective androgen receptor modulator.The SARM was, as was briefly explained to the platoon, a drug especially designed to duplicate the androgenic effects of anabolic steroids, sans their annoying side effects.But Ultarine had its own side effects, centering on loss of body moisture through sweating and urination, and the occasional diarrhea.Accordingly, every recruit was required to carry a canteen on his belt from that moment onwards and required to guzzle three liters of water a day outside of meals.Metaracetam and Ampakinatam were also on the menu, the first intended to improve memory retention and the second to enhance attention span and alertness.Toni came to suspect that it was the second pill that was responsible for the almost fluorescent yellow urine he began to pass.Aside the intense physical fitness program, Toni was soon dealing with long hours at a desk or in U formation out in the open, soaking in as much military lore as his instructors could dish out.He had always been prone to becoming lost in his own thoughts, but the medication had performed a miracle of sorts; he hung on his instructors every word, committing all to memory with obsessive interest.The list of aptitudes they were expected to accumulate had seemed menacingly vast on his first day, but gradually he began to gain confidence in his ability to meet expectations.The clear downside to the nootropics was their side effects.Tonis level of alertness was so high that he usually found himself mentally exhausted at the end of their day, which wasnt a problem at all until they began to be pulled from their beds for supplementary training.Recruits often went into standby mode in those hours, their minds having closed up shop for lack of stock, only their most basic goods still on display.Some cracked in those days and others crashed, but Toni did neither; instead he operated in a dream like state, and sometimes he was surprised to discover in their conversations the next day that there had been supplementary training in the night.Sometimes he would remember those times as if they were dreams, and sometimes not at all.He told no one about the lost time, of course.He also kept quiet about the obsessive and repetitive behavior he had begun to exhibit in his spare time, although not for fear of embarrassment.He had noticed other recruits pacing about erratically, biting at their fingernails until they bled, and engaging in all manner of repetitive tics.One was spending far too much of his free time alone in the remotest of the latrine stalls.By their fourth week of training Toni could no longer call himself scrawny.He was putting his all into the physical exercises and the dopes magic was doing its work.He had gained a full six kilo mass in that time, and the first thing he bought with his initial paycheck was an anti scarring salve.In their fifth week of training, the same day recruit Debusey suffered a mental breakdown, earning him a one way ticket out of the SIC, Toni spoke with several of his mates about the Orbit Order, still curious as to why they had put up with it.Wasnt that hard, honestly, Gordie replied, ignoring the outraged retorts of his somewhat weaker mates.It was Hirum, however, possessed of a characteristic directness that Toni had begun to appreciate, who gave him a straight answer.Listen, Toni.What you guys did was stupid.But I honestly didnt know any of you well enough to just give you over to the Screamer like that.And to tell you the truth, we all got to know you better after the order ...Yep, a little too well, maybe  Ray added with a sly grin.Listen, Hirum insisted.What Im saying is that if anyone was going to take a dive at the sarges feet, it would have been Ian.Not you.We even talked about that for a while, but nobody stepped up cause then you would have taken the Walk as well.I didnt know you guys were still so put out with him, Toni observed quietly.He hadnt missed the collection of scowls at Hirums statement.Lets just say he got a little too comfortable at being carried around like that.You, at least, were just as pissed off as we were, he replied somberly.Corporal Baylen showed up that week to assume the mantle of assistant instructor, taking upon his shoulders the added task of training his charges in hand to hand combat.The platoon was introduced to the bases Combat Training Square, where they took to assembling every second day, weekend or not, for HHC training.Baylen loved the Art, as he liked to call it.I doubt you Suit pukes will have any need for this training, your thirty millimeter cannon should be keeping you clear of that, but this training should help you become more agile on your feet, and you can certainly use that.Two weeks from now the LT will begin to participate in these classes, and so well be adding some fall rise and lateral impact training to your repertoire before then.Trust me when I say youll need that when you face him.I think by then well have begun your absorption tests as well.Nobody had asked what absorption tests were; they all knew better than that.Two weeks later, they found out.The absorption tests were simple in their design; a recruit was told to remain stock still in the middle of the CT square, where he would be subjected to a series of shoves, kicks and (if the Screamer was around) blows to the body in ever increasing intensity, said recruit being expected to absorb the punishment in place without flinching, swaying or (most especially) falling down.Staying on ones feet proved to be impossible, though, unless that persons name was Gordie.His body had sucked in the Ultarine like a sponge, and he was slowly becoming as solid as a rhinoceros.The ultimate goal of the exercise, as they were eventually informed, was for a future Suit driver to become accustomed to performing in combat while under enemy fire.Toni gradually began to imagine every slap as the direct impact of an anti materiel grenade, every kick or shove the nearby detonation of an artillery shell.Masons were direct artillery hits.By the end of the second week of absorption tests, rationality and lucidity were tested both during and immediately following every pounding.It proved to be somewhat difficult to strip down and reassemble a Lacrau after a few blows to the skull.After a while, the tests began to gain entertainment value; the male recruits found special interest in contemplating the violent femmes as they were put through their paces.In those tests it also became clear why Hannah had made it thus far.The exercise began with the intimidating encirclement of the subject by the three members of the Drill Team, Baylen adding to the pressure by fixing the female recruit with a dead eye stare.And it was the stare itself, apparently, which tended to get her going.Standing with her feet widely spaced apart, her arms stretched out beside her, she would bite down on her lips to suppress a giggle, an effort made even harder by the face pulling recruits sitting at the sidelines.Toni noticed that simply smiling at her in those moments was enough to get her going.The bully team then spiraled inwards and she would find herself being shoved every which way, holding her knees slightly bent so she might react faster to any push, pull or kick.The only time he ever saw her smile falter was when she received a particularly vicious blow to the head.Mason at his best, of course.Other than that, her morale had proven unshakeable.Watching the other femmes taking punishment had its own entertainment value.Sueli kept her face tightly expressionless as she was buffeted left and right, but when struck just right she would briefly show the endearingly outraged expression he kept watch for.Rakaia, in true Terminator style, would put up a mean face.She was, however, the femme who fell most frequently, being of slighter build than the others, and each time she would rise with a furious expression, as if wishing death and destruction to the world for not being of more substantial size.Toni often wondered whether she was counting the days until her chance at driving a real Suit.He certainly was.Baylens arrival had been accompanied by a torrent of speculation as to what had kept him off base for so long.Some said he had gotten into trouble with civilian authorities over a bar fight, an idea most promptly discarded since no obituaries had recently been reported by the media.Other speculated that he had finally managed to bed Captain Damiens teenage daughter, trying to make the connection between ones arrival and the others sudden bout of irritability.Still others whispered that the corporal was currently the prime suspect in a rape investigation, although no one had volunteered the victims identity.Toni kept silent whenever he heard the whisperings and tried not to say anything stupid.He already knew why Baylen had been delayed, but had been asked by his instructor to keep it quiet.Toni didnt quite know why Baylen had confided in him, but was beginning to suspect that he came across as trustworthy.The conversation had taken place after hours, as Toni coated the caserns exterior walls as punishment for an infraction he could no longer remember.Mason had decided that Toni shouldnt end basic training before putting a fresh coat of whitewash on the Company building.Baylen sometimes loitered about while he worked, ostensibly to supervise the job, keeping up a low drone of conversation as Toni smeared the walls, the corporals deep drawl pleasant company after the Screamers daily abuse.Sometimes the recruit would get a heads up from his corporal, and those warnings had more than once proven useful in keeping clear of Masons radar.And then, out of nowhere, he found his instructor dropping the name of Miriam Reeves.The sarge from Valhalla?Toni asked, trying to remember her face.It had been quite pretty in a very freckly sort of way.Yep, Baylen confirmed.Thats why she had her eye on me when I took Happyface to the back, to keep me outta trouble, see?Toni nodded silently and returned to his work, his defined forearms lime smeared up to his elbows.Theres nothing wrong with a corp and a sarge getting together, you know.But its gotta be off base, and there was a rumor going round we were getting intimate in the sergeants mess quarters.And then Captain Damien heard about it ...Baylen didnt quite spit the name out, but the resentment was there nonetheless.Toni simply nodded and made a noise of encouragement as he worked.So I was called to his office one day, and he told me there was an enquiry into the matter.I told him he neednt worry, that I and the sarge were respecting the institution.But some people are queer, you know?My saying that confirmed that we were together, and he didnt like that at all.Told me I would never train another platoon.So I put in a few off days, compliments of the FIC commander, you know him, big fella.Only came back for the enquiry proceedings, and that was ugly.Gotta be the most unpleasant business Ive ever gotten mixed up with.I tell you, Toni, this army is asleep at the helm.Were worried about whos sleeping with who when we should be worried about our mission.You might not have noticed it yet, but eventually you will.Were going through the motions of training, we talk about operations and tactics and strategy and all that, but ultimately were asleep, sleep walking through our jobs since theres no boogeyman to fight out there.About the last time this army was awake was with the PBI, and that was about twenty years ago ...The PBI?Toni suddenly felt more than passing curiosity at the conversation.Phantom Battle Incident.There was a time just before I joined when some of the research hubs were thinking of separating into independent states, you know.Never heard about it, Toni said, trying to remember his history lessons in Leiben High and drawing a blank in his effort.Of course you didnt.That isnt taught at school, and there was only some talk about it in the media and Civilian Network, but at the height of the crisis there was a training incident involving a few tanks, friendly fire during a live fire exercise.Someone botched things up and, by the time it got leaked to the media, it was supposed to be a full blown battle.I was fourteen years old at the time, and seeing everyone scared shitless like that gave me more of a hard on for the service than anything else could have.Some Cavalrymen and Arties died on that day, twenty four, I think.Anyway, that must be the last time there was a real honest to god Red Alert on any military base.Since then its been slow slumber.Toni was surprised by the tone; he had never heard Baylen speak so bitterly before.I thought you loved the army, Corp.No, Toni, I hate the army.I hate todays army, the one that exists.What I do love is the army the MEWAC could have been if there wasnt so much bullshit flying around.Never forget this, kid.Even in times of peace the Enemy still exists.But this enemy is on our side.Every soldier napping on sentinel duty, every asshole sergeant with a chip on his shoulder, every officer making mountains out of molehills, is the enemy.And youve gotta watch out for the enemy.I heard what happened on your first day in the SIC, kid.That was just dumb.You think Ians your enemy?Take a better look around you.At least he was trying to do his job right.Youre the ones who screwed up, you were the enemy that day.You gotta be true now, kid.A few months from now I might have to salute you, and the last thing I want before me is another sarge or officer with a chip on his shoulder.So be true, pay attention to your classes and make me proud, alright kid?The criticism had bitten deeply into Toni, mostly because he knew that Baylen was speaking from the heart, and there was no appropriate defense against such words.He was also appalled at the notion that he would soon outrank the veteran standing before him.The weeks wore on at a snails pace and Toni kept putting in his best.The dope wasnt all that fueled him anymore, his occasional conversations with Baylen having proven to be more powerful medicine, and his persistence finally began to pay off.The platoon had weekly field exercises to contend with, but on the Friday of their sixth week, he was faced with the field navigation evaluation that each recruit would need to pass in order to qualify for their week in the field.The morning was spent in examination in the dimly lit classroom, the examinees noses nearly having to touch the exam sheet in order for them to read the questions there.Toni was in the Zone that morning, his tics having subsided due to the scale of the challenge before him.By mornings end and as a subdued platoon filed out of the freshly whitewashed building, he knew he had aced the challenge.Lunch was heavy but Toni ate light, anticipating strenuous activity for the afternoon.Soon they would be tackling a navigation course, and he intended to finish before the Special One, as Ian had begun to be called.Toni harbored no hostility towards his senior, having begun instead to view him as a rival.He had no illusions, however, about which of the two of them was the more capable.At fourteen hundred hours, the SITs entire complement of fifteen recruits stood in formation under the eternal red sun, the orbs heat turning the humidity from the wetter uniforms into steam as the drill team contemplated them.The lieutenant began to brief the platoon.The following examination will be a two part topographical orientation course.The first part is essentially a treasure hunt, since at its end you will find an envelope with the printout map that will be needed to complete the second.Each recruit will be set loose at five minute intervals.Said recruit will be armed with a map, a scale meter and a set of hectametric coordinates.If examinees happen to be caught together on any part of the course, they will be failed.I should add that there would be no point in doing this anyway, since the first three objectives are unique to each recruit.You will also each carry a GPS marker to be kept on your corpse at all times.By collating the markers data at the end of your run, we will know which objectives were reached and which were not.There will be penalties for failing an objective.If, however, you are unable to finish or you should fail to hand in your marker, you will find yourself privileged to continue your training ...in the FICs and far away from us.Is that clear?All present hollered their understanding in unison, and before long the drill team had handed out the gear and sorted the group into single file, the most senior of their number at the fore.Recruit Templeton, you have one minute to consult your map, Baylen warned.Ian put a knee to the ground, spread his map out and aligned it with his surroundings.He consulted his coordinates briefly and then placed the transparent scale meter over the map.After a quick look around he stood, stowing the gear away as he patiently waited for the start signal.Thirty seconds later he was off at a sprint, disappearing into the bushes north of their position with no sign of slowing down.The minutes passed by and Toni waited patiently as the recruits before him were released into the wild.He chose not to worry about competing against Ian; he would run well within the limits of his body, consigning unto the God of the Underdogs the task of leading his rival astray.Recruit Miura, you have one minute to consult your map.Taking two quick steps forwards, Toni put a knee to the ground and spread the map out before him, taking care to orient it correctly.The effort proved to be a simple one, as hed already seen his mates do the same over the preceding minutes.Consulting the initial coordinates on a slip of paper, he superimposed the scale meter upon the maps appropriate grid square and took note of his first objective.A smile came to his camouflaged lips.The MEWAC water tower was easily visible from any open area in its immediate vicinity, and indeed he found it when he peered south, four stout concrete pillars supporting a spherical, ballasted water tank up to a respectable height of 25 meters.Toni confidently stowed his gear and then set off at a canter once Baylen had given the signal, seeing no significant obstacles to overcome, only a steep, continuous ascent to the crest of the hill occupied by the tower.Within four minutes, he had reached his objective.As he slowed to a stop near the closest pillar, he found his first snag of the day.A navy blue envelope fluttered clearly in view, tied as it was to one of the many rungs ascending the northern pillar.The tower itself was, however, besieged by a massive growth of thorn bushes.How his instructors had managed to place the envelope up there without leaving their hides among the thorns was beyond him.It was also beyond his patience to discover how, and so he launched himself forward at a mad sprint, terribly aware he would be hating himself over the following days.As he reached the obstacle, Toni pounced, catapulting himself towards the pillar in a ballistic trajectory.Curling into a tight ball, he flew onwards until, as the pillar approached, he kicked his legs out and splayed both arms before him, reaching out towards the nearest approaching rung.His legs connected first, colliding against the reinforced concrete a split second before his hands clasped the rung.Strong as he was, however, inertia was stronger, and it was his helmeted skull that finally put a stop to his momentum, clashing against a higher rung with enough force to dent the steel.So thats how they did it, he thought through the daze, feeling overproud for having managed to evade the thorns entirely.With a free arm he snatched the envelope from the rung and stowed it away in his pocket, before twisting his body and neck about for a look around.The new predicament slowly dawned upon him.His drill team had not leapt over the obstacle to gain access to the pillar.The reason he knew this was because, had they done so, they would then have had to contend with jumping directly into the thorn bushes themselves.Those bushes appeared entirely undisturbed.In fact, they appeared quite intent on losing their virginity to the imprudent recruit hanging above them.With a groan of dismay, Toni launched himself into the vegetation, and fear quickly morphed into horror as the bushs tentacle like branches wrapped themselves around his body with his every move.After several fruitless attempts to delicately weave his way out, Toni finally shoved his hands into his armpits, lowered his center of mass and tucked his chin into his chest, presenting the offending thorns with his helmets dented dome.He then forged a path through the thorns by brute force, exiting the obstacle moments later with spiny clumps of bush still attached to him.Ignoring the vegetation and his numerous injuries, Toni put his knee down and opened his prize, finding that his second objective awaited him on the firing line of a deactivated shooting range due east.Swearing under his breath, he set off once more, finally finding a blue envelope resting atop the range mast, requiring him to lower it by the halyard as one would a flag.Tonis third objective took him east, and his fourth further east still, bringing him close to the end of his map.He was on his way to the fifth objective, a crest situated due south of his position, when he came across a disorientated Rakaia.Need some help?he asked her as she stumbled about.No!I mean, yes!Oh  she groaned at her sudden dilemma.Toni shrugged and kept jogging.Wait!Where are you going?Delta Morana, he replied over his shoulder, still got a click of running ahead of me ...Youre going the wrong way, she countered, her brow furrowing.You should be descending, not moving towards high ground.All deltas are summits, Tani, thats why Im moving to high ground.Youve got your peaks and valleys confused.She yanked out a crumpled map and gave it a long, hard look.I knew that ...she stated in an undertone.Good luck, he shouted over his shoulder, already on his way.Delta Morana was a resting spot a lion would have enjoyed, had a lion been born in the history of the planet.Trees huddled ever closer to each another as they neared the summit, gradually forming a continuous canopy, only to be interrupted by a collection of granite grey rocky outcroppings.At the center of those rocks a solitary whitewashed pillar presided.To Tonis eyes, it looked like a puritan pastor preaching to the wilderness.The pillars northern face was unapproachable and so Toni began to circuit the outcropping from its eastern face, glad to be out of the sun due to the shade afforded by the densely packed trees.Already his uniform was wet under his armpits, as well as where the Tier 1 travel pack rested against his back.He puffed along doggedly as he gauged how best to approach his objective, keeping close to the rock face so he wouldnt miss the way in.A whizzing noise then became apparent and he turned towards the sound.The rock struck him hard against his helmet, breaking its chin strap and knocking him out cold.Toni returned to consciousness with an unknown presence beside him.Hands passed over his body as if the presence was trying to heal him by touch.Thank the gods I have been found, he thought drowsily.Perhaps one of the family gods his father prayed to had arrived to rescue the firstborn son.Perhaps the pillar he had seen moments before had somehow transformed into the pastor he had imagined it as.He rested a tremulous hand on the priests shoulder in thanks, only to have it slapped brusquely away.That just isnt right, he considered, trying hard to focus on the strangers face.Hazy features slowly sharpened until, eyes slowly widening in surprise, Toni found himself staring up at a very edgy Ian.Wha ...What in hell are you doing?Toni demanded weakly.Something youre not gonna like, mate ...his senior retorted as he searched through his comrades vest pockets.Toni tried to rise and received a stiff clout to the face.He momentarily descended back into the abyss.Let go, let me go or Ill break your hands!he heard someone snarl through the fog.He returned to consciousness to find Ians wrists firmly gripped in his own hands.From his seniors reddening fist hung a pendant with a fluorescent yellow GPS marker.Inside Tonis mind, disjointed pieces fell into place all at once, and a hot ball of rage ignited deep within.Youll break my hands?How exactly are you going to do that, you son of a bitch?he growled as he tried to rise.Ian blinked stupidly for a moment.He then twisted his wrists inwards and inflicted a vicious kick against Tonis head that laid him flat on his back again.Free of the vice like grip, the recruit then took off at a sprint.Tonis torso tautened and bounced back to a sitting position as if acted upon by a spring, the final assault serving to establish new priorities for the remainder of the day.First he would find Ian and kill him, and then he would complete his course.Ian sprinted lithely into the eastern wilderness with Tonis marker firmly gripped in his fist, his furious junior in hot pursuit.The terrain was uneven and cluttered with obstructions, but that played in Tonis favor; after having spent his youth exploring the farm and the surrounding wilderness, his skill at tackling obstacles was perhaps the highest of the platoon.You bushwhacking, yellow, thieving backstabberrr!Ill kill, ILL KILL YOU!he roared, his bruised and punctured body fueled by outrage into a leg pumping frenzy.His thighs burned fiercely but he scarcely acknowledged the pain; in due time that pain would wrap around him like a python, but for the moment it was no worse than a rat snake nipping at his heels.On the other hand, he was closing the distance between them fairly quickly.Ian suddenly made a left turn and began to forge a path northwards through the bushes.Toni peered beyond and realized why: the way ahead was barred by an extensive interlocking growth of thorn bushes.As the desperate pursuit continued, Toni had time to consider what would happen if Ian were to escape.He was horribly certain that if he were to return to base without an explanation for his missing marker, he would be failed from the SIT.He was also quite certain that Ian had already completed his own course.But he couldnt understand how Ian expected to get away with it.If the drill team were to read his markers data afterwards, they would discover that he had inexplicably returned to an objective of the first part of the course after finishing his.He couldnt possibly hope to   And then it hit him.Ian had hidden his marker somewhere safe before searching Toni out.The data it contained would give him all the alibi he needed.Which meant that Tonis future was presently running on two legs and trying hard to escape him.All of a sudden, the two recruits came upon a wide, dried up riverbed, its multitude of large, polished rocks presenting Ian with an unexpected obstacle to a clean getaway.A livid Toni tackled him and for a brief moment both were airborne.They then came crashing down onto the rocky ground.The recruits rolled among the jutting rocks, Ians steel helmet clanging loudly as it collided against granite.Toni stood quickly to face his senior, only to find the Leibenese already on his feet, his fists held high as he glared hatefully from between scraped forearms.Tonis jaw tightened at the prospect of imminent pain.He had no illusions about which between them was the better fighter.Toni launched himself forwards and tried to tackle Ian again, only to receive a stiff kick to the face that blocked his advance in an instant.He opened the distance hastily, blood coursing from his battered nose as he scrutinized his adversarys fighting stance.Ian appeared as unapproachable as a battle tank.His seniors expression slowly relaxed and became impassive.He had apparently chosen to bide his time.Toni finally smiled.You must have trained really hard to be able to fight like that, he quipped, stooping down to pick up three good sized pebbles, but its a pity you never grew up on a farm.Probably couldnt throw a stone to save your life, could you?The pebble whizzed through the air, its movement a blur as it struck Ians upheld arm.The recruit winced with sudden pain and he gripped his wrist, only to be struck by a second pebble against his helmet.A third stone collided against Ians jaw with a dull thwack, sending its victim down onto a knee as it escaped clattering among the rocks.Before Ian could recover, Toni had closed the distance; he received a kick to his head with enough force to send the battered helmet clanging over the river bed with chin strap twirling.Ian clinched at his juniors legs and planted his own squarely beneath his body, and then he lifted Toni high into the air, twisting his body around before sending his victim crashing onto the waiting rocks.The impact expelled all the air from Tonis lungs with a hollow humph; he clawed desperately at Ians torso as a wave of nausea threatened to overcome him.His senior calmly placed the palms of his hands against Tonis chest and began to push inexorably, and his grip slowly began to slip and weaken.Toni stared at Ians splayed hands with furrowed eyebrows, suddenly realizing that there was no GPS marker in them.He remembered that he hadnt seen the senior place it in his pockets during his escape.Finally, he understood.Tonis knee briefly jockeyed for position and then promptly ploughed into his adversarys crotch.He managed to repeat the act once before Ian clamped his legs together and rolled stiffly away.He stood and his eyes flashed over his surroundings, finding nothing.He then set off at a run, leaving his groaning adversary behind.Following Ians escape route in the opposite direction, Tonis eyes darted about for the fluorescent marker until, four hundred meters from the riverbed, he finally found it swaying on a branch well inside the sea of wild blackberry bushes they had skirted.Grimacing at what he was about to do, Toni bounded into the brambles at an insane sprint, coming to a halt four paces short of his objective due to the branches tearing embrace.Covering his bleeding head with his savaged arms, he forged a path through the remaining gap until he was able to clutch the marker away from its resting place.With a step back and an excruciating turn, he prepared to make his getaway.Ian stood blocking his way out with shoulders hunched, his bleeding chin tucked into his chest as he eyed his junior with dead eyes.There was nothing to be said between them.Toni considered the odds.Coming to a decision, he did an about face and launched himself into the brambles again, screaming with rage and pain as he continued to forge a path through the thorny growth.Chancing a quick look over his shoulder, he saw Ian backing up for a running start.The height of the thorn growth gradually rose above head level, and Toni was relieved to find empty pockets beneath the bush that he promptly began to tunnel through.Moments later he tore through the sea of thorns opposite side and sped off, leaving an enraged Ian howling and lost behind him.Tonis legs pumped furiously as he opened the distance between them, exhilarated by his escape, but somehow ashamed.There was something very craven about running away from an enemy.He coursed over a crest and into the valley beyond, before turning south and circuiting a humble koppie to veer west.Finding a dense growth of bushes, he took shelter inside it, taking special care to first make sure that the particular variety lacked thorns.Battered and bloody hands removed the map from a pocket, pricking themselves a thorny branch still attached to his uniform.He splayed the chart on the ground, not bothering to orient it since the bushes prevented him from viewing his surroundings.He studied the map carefully, comparing it with his memory of the terrain he had just crossed.What he saw there made him apprehensive.His escape had somehow taken him beyond the edge of his map.Simply turning west would not be enough to help him return to it, however, since he then ran the risk of passing below it.He would have to take a north westerly course, one which would take him dangerously close to the sea of thorns, and towards where he had last seen his senior.After a careful search of his surroundings, a grim Toni left his temporary refuge and set off at a brisk jog.The terrain was littered with small rocky hills, and with clumps of trees interspersed with myriad bushes.Feeling naked in the open ground, Toni took a page out of his training manual and chose a more winding path from grove to grove in order to avoid being seen.As he came upon the summit of a low hill, Toni finally saw a landmark he was familiar with.To the west, perhaps a kilometer away, rested a delta point crowned by a whitewashed central pillar.He smiled tremulously as he remembered what it had reminded him of.What a sight for sore eyes you are, pas  A sound from behind caught his attention but it was already too late.Ian collided violently against his body and the two recruits rolled downhill, arms flailing violently, before dropping off a short precipice.Toni returned to consciousness surrounded by unfamiliar terrain.He rose to his feet but promptly collapsed onto his rump in disorientation.He watched in dazed fascination as a blood streaked Ian, his uniform in tatters, calmly approached him.I need to thank you for your love, Tonesy ...Ian snarled before kicking viciously him in the groin.Sudden pain exploded from below and Toni curled into a defensive ball in slow motion, steeling himself for a pummeling.Ian stooped over him rained a flurry of concussive blows upon his body, roaring in fury every time a fist connected.Finally exhausted by the effort, he tore Tonis pockets apart until the fluorescent GPS marker fell to the disturbed ground.Snatching the device up with a huff of satisfaction, he then leaned towards his adversarys ear.Ill be having an orgasm when I see you walk.Thats why youll see me smiling when you pass me by   And what, exactly, do you think youre doing, soldier?Toni heard the woman but was unable to see her through the blood in his eyes.He did recognize the voice, however.Cleaning the blood from his face with a dirty cuff, he blinked furiously and peered in her direction.A small army camp was laid out before him, nothing more than a smattering of tents beside a shallow stream.To Tonis weary eyes, it was Napoleons Grande Arme.Several soldiers stood or squatted beside a water purification apparatus, considering the battered recruits with surprise or mild amusement.A pair of corporals stood flanking Lieutenant Rose as she fumed not five meters away, considering the pair with a humorless half smile.SIX      Mining Quadrant, 14H15, 19th of April, 2771      The convoy lumbered steadily onwards, the trails degraded surface causing each vehicle to bounce and shudder in turn.The trucks bore no emblems, but their antique lines recalled the modular transport vehicles once popular in the 2030s.Their gray panels were battered and scratched in a way that suggested they had seen extended service in harsh conditions.The trucks were preceded by a light tactical vehicle, its chassis, comprised of a framework of metal tubes, bounding along gracefully as the exposed suspension system mopped up vibrations.Four men in civilian attire manned the buggy, the driver and his wingman strapped into their seats with three point harnesses, the other pair squatting on the rear mounted engine and firmly gripping the metal tubes.They appeared to be having the time of their lives.The men came upon the clearing carelessly, the tactical vehicle galloping over the treeless expanse as the engine noisily cleared its throat.As it reached the clearings opposite end, the buggy slowed down and then executed a tight about face, abruptly ejecting the lesser prepared of the rear passengers.He rolled over the sandy soil to the laughter of his comrades, only to laugh himself once he recovered, taking a moment to slap the sand out of his generous head of hair.He clambered back on board and the buggy set off slowly and deliberately, the second rear passenger spraying a fluorescent orange line onto the ground as it rolled in the opposite direction.The trucks turned towards the line as they arrived and toed it in turn.Before long, eighteen heavy transport vehicles were resting side by side in a neat line.The clearing was soon teeming with people.All wore civvies, the younger workers wearing colorful clothing of all sorts, the older men preferring conservative earth colored wares, making them look as if they were wearing different versions of the same crappy old uniform.Those men seemed the more diligent workers of the lot as well, and they set about removing equipment from the trucks, recruiting the nearest and most cooperative youths to assist them.The remainder took to the clearing like children to a playpen, and soon their laughing voices could be heard as they crossed the grounds at a run.One of the running boys suddenly stopped as if something unusual had caught his attention.He peered down at the depression at his feet, and no doubt there must have been a curious expression on his face as he considered the pattern stamped there.He hollered towards a group of passing boys, and soon they were doing some staring of their own.Then one of them took off towards the remaining workers and spoke briefly with them.All work was abandoned as the workers began to spread out over the field, and their shouts of excitement soon became clearly audible.Thats right, natives, worship the spoor of the gods, Deadhand whispered, the briefest of smiles alighting on his face.The convoy had been picked up by drones well before their arrival, and the clearing was presently being covered by three mobile Suits.Mentally opening the appropriate comm channel, Deadhand updated his commander for the day.Lippard, this is Deadhand, over.Lippard here, inform.I dont know if you see it from your vantage point, but these natives are civilians.I repeat, they are civilians.My vantage is good enough to see that, kinder.That is not the issue.Their chances of survival depend on whether they suspect our presence here.First appearances are not encouraging.Deadhand didnt like the way she stated that last part.He preferred Kaiser in such operations.If the Bavarian had been born with a personal totem, it would most definitely have been a fox.He was sly, calculating and wise beyond words.Lippards totem, however, would have been just like her nickname.She was a leopard to the core.Her tail twitched nervously all the time, and she was always ready to pounce at a moments notice.To a leopards eyes, the most innocent of gazelles was fair game.As long as she was hungry and conditions were fair, she was fated to ambush her prey, and she would never feel an ounce of shame in the aftermath of the carnage.Lippard was his number one choice of commander in a stand up fight, but as soon as he had seen the boys playing in the field, he found himself missing the old fox.Looks like its going to be one of those missions, boss, he remarked as the stick figures beside the trucks began to raise a communications antenna.Moose, Deadhand, standby.I will establish a link with Ebony Tower, she declared.Whatever his misgivings, Deadhand nevertheless opened his tactical eye and focused it on the clearing.Each vehicle had appeared to carry a driver and two workers and, factoring in the buggy, that put about fifty eight civvies on site.The vehicles were parked as neatly as beer bottles upon a wooden fence.Any chance of taking prisoners, boss?Deadhand inquired.It took a while for her to answer, and when she did her voice had steel in it.Moose, suppression operation initiates at the end of this minute.You will launch an EDI streaker at the vehicles and initiate frequency jamming.You will set pulsed laser platform for anti personnel and neutralize all indigenous persons.Deadhand, you will set your platform to anti material and kill the vehicles engine blocks.Avoid the fuel tanks, we dont want to send out any smoke signals.You will then join us in anti personnel activities.All fleeing civilians are valid targets.Those who refrain from flight and are cooperative are to be taken prisoner.Inform if you copy, over.There was a long pause as they digested the communication, and fifteen seconds before the end of that minute both grudgingly copied it.Deadhand cursed as he set his weapon to intermediate strength and shouldered it.He cursed again as his scope roved over the excited civilians, before resting his reticule on a vehicles principal heat source.It was the stationary buggy; any fool would want to neutralize it first.The moment the mission clock added another minute to its elapsed time, a missile streaked up over the treetops and then swerved aggressively towards the parked trucks.It detonated at a respectable height above its targets, the report insignificant compared to the electromagnetic pulse it produced.As soon as Deadhands sensors detected the pulse, he fired upon the buggy and the engine incandesced and disintegrated, the vehicle doing a jumpy half turn before abruptly bursting into flames.Fat smoke billowed from the wreckage, obscuring the trucks behind it and rising into the sky.Oh, hell no, he thought.He immediately directed his platform to the left and began to fire upon the vehicles engines one at a time, striving to destroy as many as possible before any more could become cloaked in smoke.Fifteen trucks were soon neutralized, but the rest became obscured and civilians began to run towards them.Deadhand, you dummkopf, shift your position and kill those vehicles!Lippard snapped over the comm.The Suit pilot leaned forwards and took off at speed, footpads colliding against the earth as the shouts in the clearing began to turn into screams.The cracks of low powered pulse weapons suddenly increased in frequency, and Deadhand became aware that Lippard had changed her platforms settings to automatic fire.He maneuvered out of the trees and pounded into the clearing, and the civilians wailed at his appearance as if the day of reckoning had arrived.Ignoring the scurrying figures, he moved to his left, trying to gain line of sight with the intact vehicles.The smoke enveloped them, however, and so he straddled the trail from the east and began to close the distance.The remaining mobile Suits came into view, Lippards unit striding and firing at the fleeing natives while Moose kept his distance, picking targets off from the plantations other side.A shuddering truck leapt through the smoke and sped towards him, and without further thought Deadhand opened fire.The vehicle promptly gained entertainment value, swerving brusquely before it collided against the opposite side of the trails drainage ditch, and it then caught fire as pulse after pulse of lasered light disintegrated its front compartment and the people inside it.He fired one shot too many and the beam struck a panel above the fuel deposit, sending a shower of sparks through it.Flames enveloped the vehicle and set the nearest trees alight.Deadhand began to groan.Deadhand!Avoid the fuel tanks is what I said, not aim at them.I   A loud chirp cut through her communication, making it clear someone had activated their comm channels alarm.Two vehicles escaping east, theyre beneath my line of fire, Moose interrupted calmly.Lippards Suit took quick aim and the mouth of her weapon platform strobed briefly, the light show quickly followed by the rapid snapping sounds of autofire.Deadhand vaulted forwards through the blaze and accelerated to a mad run, penetrating the smoky haze beyond to find a ravaged truck slowing to a stop as the other beyond it disappeared through the treeline.Not daring to slow down, he tore through the foliage, finding the trees too low for him to follow the vehicle at its pace.Lippie, I need overhead eyeball on the vehicle, over.There was a moment of silence over the comm.The next time you call me Lippie, Ill detonate your Suit.Is that clear, schwarze?she barked.He swallowed the insult with some difficulty and reformulated his request.Apologies, boss.I need drone recon over the area, I cant keep up with them in these trees.Return to the clearing and help us clean up this mess, the drones will finish the fugitive vehicle, she ordered instead.Deadhand about faced angrily, smothering his rage as he returned to the clearing.Once there, he stopped to take in the scenery.Most of the vehicles had been flawlessly killed.So had the civilians, for that matter.Not a moan or cry for help could be heard, only the crackling fires as they consumed the remains of the badly killed vehicles, only the heavy footfalls of Lippards and Mooses Suits as they padded over the terrain, nudging body after body for signs of life.A detonation to the east caused him to turn.The luminous ball over the plantation beyond slowly morphed into a puffy mushroom, a cloud as dark as sin that ascended the sky as bodies burned beneath it.*****      Kaiser woke suddenly in the darkness and slammed his head into an unseen panel.The Kaiser has woken, he heard his neighbor say from the other side of the bulkhead.It seems even royalty has nightmares, no?the voice declared before letting escape a cackle.Kaiser paused for a second, situating himself, and then he laughed, apologized, and greeted his neighbor.The voice belonged to Wei Guozhi, the Towers chief logistics organizer, and thus someone with whom it was important to be friendly with.He heard movement all around him, barely perceptible above the ships own noises, and realized that they were not the only ones who were awake.Greetings, comrades, he called out cheerfully.There were answering greetings, some enthusiastic, others not so much.He estimated that he could speak with five of his neighbors in that way, the remaining cubicles connecting with his accommodations only at its corners.Five neighbors who could hear him breaking wind were five too many, but the personal space more than made up for that.The sergeants were four per cubicle, while the lower ranking personnel were eleven for a space roughly twice his own.They accomplished such a feat by sleeping in shifts.At least their beds were never cold.Already Kaiser had grown accustomed to the potent gravity, and he rose gracefully from his bed, trying to not put an elbow into his immediate surroundings to keep the noise down.He turned on the emergency light only; it was all he needed.Stronger illumination would only cost him points from his card.He stopped in front of the compartments other perk; an aluminum lavatory before which a battered metal mirror hung.The face he saw there had more lines than he remembered from before their long journey.He suspected he had somehow aged in cryostasis, although the physician had scoffed at the statement, declaring instead that the higher gravity was pulling at the skin of his face in a way that only gave that impression.His hair appeared almost black in the red light.It was light brown, in fact, just shy of dirty blonde.His grey eyes appeared darker in the light as well, with a burgundy tinge that made him look like a vampire.He washed and brushed, and then uniformed himself in his more formal number two attire.He thought about his nightmare, trying to remember it but failing in the attempt.It was a now familiar failure.Since his arrival on the planet, Kaisers dreams had not been tranquil, and one in particular had been recurring with increasing frequency.He remembered the dream only because of the emotions it elicited upon waking.Misery, guilt, helplessness, a tight ball of emotions that seemed to accumulate with every episode.He discarded the thought and pocketed his wallet, bidding his neighbors farewell before leaving his room.Compared to the dim light of his quarters, the corridor was positively glowing, and he paused momentarily for his eyes to adjust.As an exclusively military structure, the Tower was small for the multitude of resources it accommodated.The consequence was a web of service passages so narrow, the only way for two people to cross in opposite directions was at nodes where they could pass abreast.Evacuation is no concern here, he mused.Passing through ...he
