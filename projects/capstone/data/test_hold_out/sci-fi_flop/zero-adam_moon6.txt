These guys are the enemy and youre giving them a stationary target.He felt like a fool.He followed after Mike as he swerved through the air.As he flew behind him he saw blood spatters running down Mikes back and legs.He landed in a flat area devoid of vegetation or life of any type.Volts and Eve were waiting for them.His boosters kicked up little dust devils as he landed.Flying was fun despite the hazards associated with it.He thought they would regroup, but Mike wasted no time.Move it.Follow me.If you see anything suspicious, fire on it.How will we know if something is suspicious?Everythings dangerous on Cogmore.Lets go.He took off at a jog and they followed after him the best they could.Mike had his guns out, so they made the conscious decision to open their weapon hatches.Zero felt like a badass.They ran down an alleyway, possibly the only alley in the cityor town, or hovel, or whatever this place was.Most of the buildings were too rickety or small to have walls big or sturdy enough to hide behind.As soon as they emerged, they came under fire from small arms.The bullets pinged harmlessly off of Mike and he took to the fight like hed been looking forward to it all day.He whooshed into the air and swooped up and down, in and out, taking out the handful of attackers.They stood rooted to the spot and watched him work.He fired each time he was close enough to the assailants, blowing them apart into splattery, sludgy messes.Some of the Cogmores hid behind plywood boards and piles of trash while others hugged walls, taking potshots around corners.The three of them had nowhere to hide and nowhere to run.An RPG exploded in front of them, knocking them back and slamming Eve into the wall.Volts shot into the air and went straight towards the lone attacker, his guns out and firing as he descended.The Cogmore flew apart like a burst water balloon and Volts hovered above his corpse to make certain he would never move again.Mike fired a quick burst at a target in the distance and then flew back to join them.Volts turned and came back too.They set down, Mike plastered in thick blood and gore and Volts hyperventilating even though he had no lungs or adrenaline.The coast was clear, but Mike didnt let his guard down for a second.Hurry up.More of them will show up soon.As they ran, Zero said to Mike, These people dont seem conquered to me.In fact, they act like theyre at war.This is a big planet.The rest of the world has learned to do whats expected of them, but all the revolutionaries come here because this is where we are, and where the Beetars operate from.The attackers actually make up a fraction of a percent of the Cogmore population.The rest of these insects have bowed to their superiors.Mike fired his gun and a single Cogmore ahead of them fell over dead.Sure enough, it had a rifle clutched in its tiny hands.He turned back towards them and pointed at the alleyway theyd come from.Thats Beetar headquarters.They call it a garrison, but we do all the soldiering for them.Its mostly filled with diplomats and strategists and such.That explained why the buildings stood out from the neighborhood.A shadow fell over them and Mike reacted like a coiled spring.When he saw what cast the shadow, he relaxed.He put his gun down by his thigh and said, Thats Kathy up there.Winthrops bound to be flying around here somewhere too.Theyre a good team.Its their watch, thats why were just dicking around today.Youll be with them all day tomorrow.If this was dicking around, Zero was scared to death to find out what the real job entailed.Kathy waved down at them, and in that split second she was fired upon.Mike ran off, shouting, Hurry up!over his shoulder.They didnt see any more Cogmores, but they were hit from behind a couple of times.Mike stopped and beckoned for them to turn around.They were on a barren patch of land.Beyond were three buildings.Two were identical, side by side.Beetars headquarters.Towering above them from behind was a fat lump of a building.That one was their building.Besides that, as far as they could see was a barren wasteland dotted with makeshift huts.He said, Youd be surprised by how civilized the Cogmores are around the rest of the planet.The assholes all congregate here.Eve asked, Whats the rest of the world like?They farm for the Beetars.They grow this seed or something that the Beetars enjoy grinding up and drinking in their water.Id compare it to coffee, but it would be a terrible comparison.Parsons says its like sludge with a hint of diarrhea and cigar smoke.He keeps trying to learn to like it, but he cant.Volts asked, Wheres all the wildlife and vegetation?From what Ive been told, the Beetars killed everything off that didnt aide the Cogmores in growing their cash crops.It was a smart move if you think about it.They took away their infrastructure.The Cogmores now serve one purpose, and thats to grow the crops.In return, theyre fed and kept safe.Zero said, That doesnt sound like a good deal.It sounds like the Cogmores are slaves.I dont have all the answers.The Beetars work in mysterious ways.We had a guy here who thought the Beetars had to intervene to stop the Cogmores from ruining their own planet the same way we humans ruined Earth.If thats right, then the Beetars saved the Cogmores from themselves.Zero sighed, unsure if he was playing for the good guys anymore.Mike said, Its best to obey orders.You can question everything later, when you get your bodies back.Until then, we serve a purpose.Once you go on patrol you wont give a damn about motives or reason, youll just want to kill as many Cogmores as possible, because theyll be trying to kill you.Zero looked at the three buildings in the distance.It was ridiculous that so much blood was being shed over three simple nondescript structures.If all the bad Cogmores convene on those three buildings, then why not evacuate them and nuke the shit out of the entire area?We could then set up base somewhere else.Mike nodded as though he was considering the merits of Zeros idea.Then he shook his head abruptly and said, We dont make those types of decisions.Like I said, just keep your questions to yourselves and do your duty and maybe youll survive long enough to get reunited with your flesh.A mech flew their way from the direction of the buildings and landed a few feet in front of them.It had blood dripping from its metal surfaces and little char marks here and there.It said to Mike, Kathy told me the new meat is here.To them it said, Its nice to meet you.Im Winthrop.He went around and shook each of their hands as they told him who they were.Winthrop turned to Mike.If youre heading back to base now, I can cut a path for you.Mike looked them over and seemed to judge them on the spot.Yeah, that might be a good idea.Well be right behind you.Winthrop leapt up and then shot off through the air.Mike started to jog.Hurry up.They got through the alleyway between the two identical buildings without being ambushed, and flew up and in through the opening at the top of their base without taking fire.Meanwhile, Winthrop whooshed about like an angry hornet, letting loose burst after burst of small arms fire wherever he saw a potential threat.Mike set down between them and said, Good job, soldiers.What do you think of the place?Zero said, Its a nightmare.Has anyone ever been taken down out there?He laughed.Oh yeah.It happens all the time.Thats why we were in such desperate need of replacements.Volts said, But we were the last of them.Does that mean therell be no more troops coming through here?No way.Theyve probably rebuilt the training center back on Epigog already.A fresh batch of recruits is probably being processed as we speak.That was a good thing.Zero could already tell they were woefully undermanned here.Mike added, Give it a couple months and well see some new meat come through here again.Zero hoped he was right.He hoped they would survive long enough to see them too.They met with Jackson even though none of them had yet forgiven him for what hed made them do to the captive Cogmores.Mike went off to meet with Parsons.Jackson led them to a filthy room with dented walls, peeling paint, and light fixtures that hung from the ceiling like theyd been yanked out.There was a bank of monitors against one wall, and nothing else besides a single table in the middle of the room.Jackson said, The reason most of this place looks like a bomb hit it is because one did.We were infiltrated last year and the Cogmores hit us hard.They killed three units before we wiped them all out.Eve asked, How many Cogmores were there?Thousands.It was a concerted effort to get rid of us once and for all.Thats why we run round the clock sweeps now and eliminate threats on sight.Jackson waved towards the monitors.And its why we have those things.Now we can see everything within a twenty mile radius of this building.Once we get a few more soldiers based here, well make someone a dedicated surveillance officer who can stay with the cameras and keep a constant vigil of our surroundings.Until then, we only use this room at night when our patrols are less effective.He pointed at Zero.You go and get recharged just now.Youll take the watch with me tonight.Zero hated the notion of staying up all night with Jackson the jerk, but if manning the monitors was part of the job then hed do what had to be done.He said, Goodnight, then, and left them.He walked back to the living quarters and plugged in for a quick charge.He awoke from his charge.Mike was in the room with him, and locked him in a stare and said incredulously, Youve only been charging for twenty minutes.Theres no way youre fully charged.He knew he was right.He felt drowsy still.He said, Sometimes I pop awake in the middle of a charge.I dont know why.Thats impossible.Charging shuts you down until its over.Well, then theres something wrong with my unit, because it happens all the time.Mike stared at him as though he didnt quite believe it.He changed the subject.I relayed your idea to Parsons and he said hell think about approaching the Beetars with it.What idea?Your idea to evacuate the buildings and nuke this area.Oh.I doubt theyll consider it though.As long as they have the situation contained, they wont change a thing.Thank you anyway.Hey, if they go for it and it gets rid of most of the attackers, Ill be thanking you.He felt weary.He said, Ill see you when I wake up.Mike watched as he closed his eyes.Right before he fell back to sleep he heard Mike mutter, Thats the weirdest thing Ive ever seen.He awoke to Jacksons mechanical face.He was holding his charge port in his fist.Rise and shine, sleepy head.Zero stepped away from the wall and counted three mechs, inanimate as they charged.He also noticed two big blocky objects dangling from power ports.Hed never seen anything like that before.Eve, Volts, and Mike were down for the night while Winthrop and Kathy stayed on duty.Jackson walked away, so he followed after him.They came to the monitor room and he stood three feet from the bank of screens.He said, It gets boring, but it has to be done.Ive personally saved lives by paying attention in this room.Ive had my own life saved too.Zero asked, How is it that Winthrop and Kathy can hold a charge for so long?They were operating all day long without a charge.Jackson looked at his feet.Weve lost so many troops here that we have spare parts readily available.We keep four back up power packs rummaged from dead units that can be interchanged in the middle of a shift so that we can stay on duty for twice as long as usual.Mike swapped Kathy and Winthrops out an hour ago.Their used power packs are charging as we speak, to be used later, probably on me and Mike sometime tomorrow.So thats what those blocky things were dangling from the charging ports back in the living quarters.If only Volts had known it was possible to swap out power packs, he wouldnt have powered off so often in the middle of a shift back on Epigog.Then again, that would have required there being an extra pack to work with, and he wasnt sure hed had one at his disposal on Epigog.He asked about the oversized paper map that covered the entire surface of the table behind them.What is that thing and why isnt it digital?You know what it is, dumbass.Its a map of the area.Its paper because Parsons likes paper.He draws a new one up every few days.I think he likes to see the progress weve made.But digitizing it would make changes so much quicker.Listen, man.Parsons has nothing to do while hes here.Its not his fault either.Hes limited by his flesh and lungs.He cant breathe the air so hes a prisoner in this facility.He keeps his sanity by doing busy work, and thats okay by me.They double checked the monitors for movement, but all was still outside.Jackson told him a story.Zero thought it was to help clear the air about the executions hed had them perform earlier.There was a unit here named Jennifer Hastings.We went through training together and formed a bond, and wouldnt you know it, she got stationed here with me.I had no idea what she looked like in real life, but our personalities clicked.We made a vow to stay together after we got our bodies back.It would be like a blind date except that I already knew everything about her.It was perfect.We were fish out of water in this part of the galaxy, in this timeframe, but at least wed have each other.Well, two months ago, during a routine patrol of the perimeter, she was ambushed by around a hundred Cogmores.I was in here watching the monitors.I saw them coming, but they were too fast.By the time I alerted her shed already started to take fire.She put up one hell of a fight, but they brought her down.When her teammate arrived, the Cogmores took him out too.I watched as those little bastards tore parts off of her.Saw them drag her head away into the desert.By the time we reacted, they were long gone.Zero wanted to put an arm over his shoulder, but he was too despondent already.Physical contact would probably make him jump out of his metal skin.Thats why I enjoy killing Cogmores.I had one chance at real happiness and they stole it from me.Im sorry to hear that.You hate me now for what I made you do, but youll learn to loathe everything about them.Mike told me about your idea to lure them all in here and then bomb them off the face of the planet, so I know youre starting to see them for what they really are, too.No, I dont hate them yet.I just thought you guys were spilling a lot of blood in these small skirmishes and not making a difference.A large scale attack with an exclamation point behind it would make an impact.Think Hiroshima or Nagasaki.What does that mean?The first atomic bombs ever dropped as an act of warfare were dropped there, and they caused so much devastation all at once that the enemy had no choice but to surrender.I see.Its a good idea, but dont be surprised if Parsons doesnt bring your suggestion to the Beetars.They tend to look at us like were rabid dogs or something.It wasnt much of an idea anyway.It just came off the top of my head.I think its a great idea.Theres nothing here worth preserving anyway.If we took out most or all of the hostile Cogmores and peace was finally achieved, we might even get stationed somewhere else.Are there better places than this?Everywhere is better than this place.We once had a guy come here from Ishca, the penal planet.Ishca is widely known as the worst place to get stationed.Well, this guy had been on Ishca for a whole year, and within a week on Cogmore he was dead.The dangers here are underreported and not nearly as glamorous as the dangers elsewhere.Here, they take your head out to the desert and youre never heard from again.Zero shook his head and said incredulously, All of this death and mayhem is so the Beetars can have a nice cup of coffee made from Cogmore seeds?What a joke.Jackson looked at him like he wanted to punch him in the head.I dont fight for the seeds.I fight for Jennifer Hastings.Give it time and youll be fighting for something similar.Youll make a friend for life only to have them fail to return from a patrol, or youll watch as the facility is overrun and half of the people you know die in front of your eyes  I apologize.I didnt mean to diminish your motives like that.I get it, dude.I was an overzealous idealist when I first got here too.Most new arrivals look at those cute little Cogmores and wonder why we hate them so much.Everyone comes around sooner or later.You will too.I sure hope not.Me too, but you will.Jackson spotted some movement on the monitor and radioed Kathy and Winthrop.In less than ten seconds the monitors lit up with strobing flashes of fire.Seconds later they got a thank you from the patrollers.It was quick, deadly, and efficient, but sadly it did nothing to give the Cogmores pause, as only moments later they saw additional movement on the monitors, Cogmores converging on their fallen comrades.Zero saw a shadow fall on him from behind, and turned to see the same little Cogmore whod met them when they first landed.It mustve been the same one, because it was freely walking about.Jackson tapped him on the shoulder and said, Ignore him.Hes a mild irritant at best.Hes actually one of the good ones.We call him Hobbs.Dont ask me why.He was already here when I got here.He keeps his feelers out in the community for any whispers concerning Cogmore attacks, and lets us know when theyre coming.Hes also responsible for bringing in most of the prisoners.Cogmores would consider him a traitor if they ever found out, but hes one of our best assets.Hobbs the Cogmore bowed before them and scurried away.Zero couldve sworn he heard it mutter something under its breath as it retreated.He didnt trust it.For all he knew it was a double agent, working for the Cogmore resistance as it pretended to aid them.Jackson mustve read his mind.The Beetars have his entire family in custody.If hes caught playing both sides, theyll be executed.Thats pretty harsh, dont you think?Thats life out here.Nothings fair and nothing is off limits.In matters of life and death, nothings sacred.He spotted movement on the monitors as soon as they turned back around.Jackson let him call it in, and with the help of the hand drawn map, he gave accurate coordinates.Seconds later, there were dozens of smoldering Cogmore corpses twitching on the ground.Before he had a chance to feel guilty for what hed done, Jackson put a hand on his shoulder and shook him excitedly.Good job.You just saved lives.Youre a natural at this.Jacksons math was skewed though.Hed saved two lives, potentially, but ended dozens to do so.Winthrop and Kathy whizzed through the skies all night long as they supplied them with targets.It was exhausting from his end, so he couldnt imagine how they felt about it.It was harsh on Cogmore.Zero could only hope to become numb to it or hed lose his mind.As soon as the sun came up, they went out to the hangar to greet Kathy and Winthrop.Kathy set down and said jovially, That was fun.Thanks for the intel.Winthrop added, That was one for the books.It was one of the best nights weve had in a long time.Zero wanted to ask them if theyd lost their goddamn minds, but thought it prudent to hold his tongue.To his utter horror, Kathy and Winthrop helped change out his power pack.They changed Jacksons too.Apparently they would patrol the skies until Mike was fully charged to relieve them.Zeros mind went black and then switched back on as soon as the new power pack was slotted into him.As soon as his eyes opened, he saw his power pack lying at his feet and every mech there staring at his gaping chest cavity.Winthrop was feeling around inside his chest.This is weird.Howd you do this?It looks like youve got extra shielding or something that covers your entire battery compartment.He shrugged.I know Doctor Henshaw said he spent a little extra time with our units.Maybe thats a modification.He could only hope they didnt look into his make up any further or theyd find his kill switch disabled too, and really start asking questions.Winthrop stood up and smiled.That doctors a genius.Im going to rig up the rest of us like you when I get a chance.Kathy asked him what was so special about the shielding.The extra shielding will withstand an EMP burst.Electronics can become disabled after an EMP burst, but a battery shrouded in this additional protection would remain working.It acts like a Faraday cage, protecting the battery from damage.Jackson said, Hook me up with one too.Ive always worried what a close quarters nuke would do to our circuits.Winthrop looked at Zero like he was a specimen under a microscope.Id like to root around inside your body later to see what else the good doctor improved upon.He said, Henshaw wanted his modifications to be a secret.He was worried hed get into trouble if the Beetars found out what hed done.Winthrop chuckled.Im no snitch.No one is going to run off and tattletale to the Beetars.Kathy clapped him on the back.Youve just contributed more to our cause than any new arrival ever has.Were not about to throw you under the bus for it.He stared up through the opened roof of the hangar with trepidation in his heart.He wanted to tell them about the disabled kill switch, but resisted the urge.He liked their enthusiasm, and he did trust them, but he hardly knew them well enough to trust them with the doctors life.Jackson said reassuringly, Youre ready for this.Cogmores vanish like cockroaches when the sun comes up.It should be pretty calm out there.Kathy added, Its a ghost town out there.Youll be fine.If Mikes not up in ten minutes Ill unplug him myself.Then she banged his chest plate back into place and slapped him on the ass.Luckily, they didnt see much activity.Jackson swooped down on one poor Cogmore and ripped it in half with concentrated fire.At first Zero thought it was barbaric, as the Cogmore just looked like a lost nomad in a dirty cloak, but when it fell to the ground and its cloak draped open, he saw an array of weaponry dangling from various holsters all over its body.He heard a cacophony of rapid gunfire and followed the noise to its source.On top of the east Beetar building, an unmanned turret was shooting wildly.He got out of its way and looked to see what it was firing at.A turret on the west building came to life and started to fire too.Then he saw it.A camouflaged wall, about twenty feet long and six feet high, was slowly moving towards them, being pushed by Cogmores.It was obviously made of metal or stone or some other type of hardy material.The turrets took minute chunks out of it until it broke to pieces and there was nothing left of it, and no one left alive to push it.The Cogmores were truly relentless in their attacks.Just then Mike appeared beside him.Thanks, Zero.Go on and get inside.He didnt need to be told twice.Before he left he told Mike about the camouflaged shield wall.Ive never seen that before.They were probably trying to get close enough to plant charges on the buildings.Ill keep an eye out for it.After seeing the turrets working so well, it dawned on him that the Beetars had some seriously misguided ideas about security.The turrets worked more efficiently than they did.Drones could patrol the skies, taking out any sign of advancing Cogmores.Satellites from space could pick up heat signatures and light the place up.Why were mechs controlled by human minds necessary when better means of defense could be employed?He didnt know, but he was getting the feeling it had to do with them being cheaper and more expendable.He swooped towards base and slipped in through the open roof.He went over to the big red button and hit it, closing the roof.He felt like he was starting to get the hang of things.Then everything took a turn for the worse.A loud boom shook the building, followed by an eerie silence almost as frightening as the explosion.Zero looked around frantically to try to see what was happening.He saw a single Cogmore rush him with a handheld device clutched in its spindly little fist.It aimed it and fired.An electrode hit him in the chest and his systems went haywire.He froze to the spot.He watched helplessly as several more Cogmores joined their comrade.They pushed him over onto his back and hefted him up like a trophy.As a unit, they ran to the north end of the hangar, where Zero saw a gaping hole that hadnt been there before.Once through, they rushed into a dark tunnel that had been dug in the ground underneath the building just as mech reinforcements arrived, firing intensely.Zeros heart filled with hope.These little rats didnt stand a chance once his teammates gave chase.That hope was dashed, though, when another explosion caved in the tunnel entrance behind them.Every twenty feet theyd plant another device, just in case his fellow mechs had found a way through the last cave in.Dirt hit his eyes as the ceiling slowly collapsed on them.But the Cogmores stayed ahead of it.Ten minutes of running through roughly hewn tunnels, they finally came to an opening.The sun blinded him as they emerged.He was surrounded by thousands of chanting and cheering Cogmores.His captives lifted him higher for all to see.He was hit with a stone and some disgusting pig rubbed shit on him.He was spat on and hit with more stones before their delirium finally subsided.A Cogmore split the crowd and everyone quieted down.It said, Shackle the mechanical man.We can learn much from it.Another, a timid voice, called out, Arent you worried theyll come looking for it?The leader said authoritatively, Theyre cowards.They fight for nothing.Theyll assume we destroyed this one, because its easier to assume its lost and do nothing than accept that it might be salvageable and try and find it.As he was moved along through the crowd, the leader said, Once its secured tightly, mobilize it so I can see its power flow.Well take it apart piece by piece to figure out how to destroy them all.That didnt sound fun.Zero hoped the Cogmore was wrong about his side.He hoped theyd come looking for him, and sooner rather than later.He was taken inside a camouflaged tent, where his arms and legs were latched to a huge boulder sticking out of the ground.When they mobilized him he was pretty sure he wouldnt be able to break that boulder to bits with strength alone.They used chains and ropes and nylon straps.When they were finally satisfied he wouldnt get loose, he looked like he was trapped inside a cocoon.Then they hit him with that handheld Taser thingy and his circuits popped to life like an appliance.He wanted to test the restraints, but thought it would look bad to do that so soon and right in front of so many of them.They left him alone for a few seconds and then the leader came inside the tent.It wore a long cloak with colorful beads sewn into it.He could just barely see its myriad tentacled legs jutting out from the base of it, squirming and moving over each other.It also carried several hand tools that no doubt were going to be used on his metal frame.It placed the tools on a wooden table beside him and walked all the way around the boulder, taking him in.It stood before him and said, All you machines know is death.I wonder if you even have the capacity to fear whats about to happen to you.It shook its head sadly and picked up a chisel.Zero yelled out, Wait, but the word came out odd.Only then did it occur to him that the Cogmore were speaking an alien language that his translator had deciphered into English, so when he spoke back the words were foreign to his ears for just a split second.The Cogmore jumped back.Machines dont know our language.We captured units like you and all they did was drone on indecipherably.Why did they program you like this?Im not just a machine.The Beetars put my mind into this robotic unit.Im a human from another world.The Cogmores huge eyelid slid from out of nowhere and made a sucking sound as it slipped across the surface of its oversized eye.It almost made Zero want to scream.This is trickery, said the Cogmore.Its not.Im a modified unit, so my translator has your language stored in its database.As he said it he realized that was probably true.The other units you captured did not have that function.It regarded him with suspicion.Perhaps this is fortuitous.We may get more information from you than from the others weve examined.So the Cogmore wasnt touched by the fact he wasnt just a machine.It didnt care that he was a living creature.It just saw it as advantageous.But it meant hed bought himself some time to find a way out of his predicament.It was too bad for the Cogmore that he knew nothing at all about operations on its planet.It was only his second day on the job.The Cogmore would probably assume he was lying to it.Then the torture would begin.It stood in front of him and began to interrogate him.You say you are a living creature inside of this machine.So if I cut you open, I could question you directly?No, no.Only my mind is in here.My thoughts control it, not my body.My body was dying, so the Beetars promised to heal me.In exchange, I would do their bidding until my body was ready to inhabit again.It wasnt laid out so clearly at first, but thats what happened in the end.The Cogmore rubbed its rounded temples.Why do you trust the Beetars will give you what they promised?I signed a contract.The Cogmore snorted derisively.It seems you know less about them than we do.The Beetars can not be trusted.Have you even seen what theyve done to my planet?They did all of this just so we wouldnt cut off their Chee supply.Chee mustve been their name for the seeds the Cogmores grew.Chee was a worthless crop to us, but the Beetars developed a taste for it.When we told them we had to stave the supply so we could grow food for our citizens, they took over our world and enslaved us to make sure we did exactly what they wanted.When we resisted, they brought in killing machines like you to enforce our servitude.We believed all of the lies the Beetars told us about galactic cooperation and sharing knowledge, but now we know the truth.I think youve been swindled just like we were, but you dont know it yet.He nodded.Hed worried about that exact thing ever since theyd put his mind inside the mech.But this Cogmore couldnt be trusted either.It was the leader of a faction that brought death and destruction to Beetars and humans alike.He only had one side of the story.The Beetars hadnt told him anything about Cogmore, so the little alien couldve been lying through its teeth for all he knew.Before the Cogmore leader worked itself into a lather, he confessed, Ive only been on this planet for two days.I know almost nothing about how things work here.The alien regarded him closely.How can I trust you?You cant.But you should know that when my power supply dwindles, Ill die.So if you need information, you need to question me soon.He didnt know why he divulged that piece of info.He thought if it hurried up and got all the intel it needed from him, maybe it would let him go before his batteries drained, killing his consciousness.But he had no reason to believe this Cogmore had any compassion, or would ever consider letting him go.The Cogmore smiled sickly.It looked him over, saying, Trust the Beetars to build you haphazardly.I might have a solution for that.It stood up and walked from the tent.Zero strained to hear the roar of his friends swooping in to rescue him, but the skies outside were silent.A moment later the Cogmore came back with a wheeled dolly that had a large rectangular apparatus on it.We use these to power our weapons.These chargers recharge themselves.Its a simple design that the Beetars know about, so theres no excuse for them to not employ one in each of you machines.With this I can interrogate you for an eternity.He shouldve kept his mouth shut.Hed never been held hostage before, but he should have known better than to divulge so much information to the enemy.Now even death couldnt save him.The Cogmore asked, Wheres your power cell located?He told it the truth.Otherwise, it might take him apart looking for it.Its under my chest plate.It got to work removing just enough of his restraints to get at his plate.It was weak, but it had tools and alien technology to aid it.His chest plate clanged on the dirt floor, and the Cogmore called outside the tent for assistance in removing his battery.Three others joined it, yanking his battery free.As soon as they disconnected it, his mind went blank.When he awoke, he felt like hed been supercharged.His mind was sharp and he felt physically stronger.The chest plate was still on the ground and the Cogmore was standing beside it, staring at him.The Cogmore said, Youll never have to charge again.My men are looking at your old battery pack to see what its made of.Until they unlock its secrets, I want you to tell me the layout of the Beetar buildings.Ive only ever been inside the building we humans use as a base of operations.The twin structures are for Beetars only.He wasnt sure if that was true, but hed never once been formally invited inside the Beetar buildings, so it felt true.It stared at him, trying to ascertain if it could trust him.Tell me about the layout of that building then.He didnt want to, but he also didnt want to refuse.He wasnt a real soldier.He hadnt been trained for any of this.Theres the main hangar.They use it when supplies come in and to leave the building for patrols.Theres a monitor room so they can scan the perimeter remotely.Theres a living quarters where they recharge each night.The general has an office.Thats all Ive seen of it so far.How many of you are there?I was one of seven robots stationed there.Besides that, theres a human in the flesh and a Beetar liaison.He didnt mention the little creepy Cogmore who wandered the halls, because he didnt want to out him as a traitor.I believe you.We have a man on the inside and thats the intel hes supplied us too.So the creepy Cogmore named Hobbs was a double agent.Now he wished hed mentioned him; the Cogmore leader would think he was lying by omission.He said, I didnt mention him because I didnt know he was working for you.Thats the point.But if youve never been inside the Beetar buildings, then you have no fresh intel for me.I need to know more.I dont know much.Ive told you all of it.Thats a pity.It reached down and picked up his chest plate.Before putting it back on him it reached inside his chest cavity and fiddled with something he couldnt see.His mind went out like a light.Zeros senses came back in a flash.Two Cogmores were staring at him when he looked up.The leader said, Theres been a development and we need to know what you know about it.How long was I out?Several days.We were going to power you back up a couple of times, but we didnt have a good enough reason.So hed been out of commission for days.He had no idea what had happened in that time, but he was furious that he was still in Cogmore custody.His friends really had abandoned him to his fate.He tried to move, but he was still secured to the big boulder.What do you want?Theyve left the planet.The Beetars and the killing machines like you all left this morning in several shuttles.Our inside man hasnt been heard from, so we dont know what happened.We want to go into their empty buildings, but we dont know if its worth the risk.It smells like a trap.He wondered if the Beetars had taken his suggestion to leave the buildings in order to draw out the rebels and then bomb the crap out of them.If that was the case, then it was a trap.He said, I know nothing.Id check it out while you have the chance.The Cogmore rubbed its head, deep in thought.It looked at the other one and they both blinked to each other.It said to Zero, Youre right.We might not have much time to ponder this.If they come back well have squandered the perfect opportunity.If youre lying, well kill you.That didnt bother him as much as it should have.He already felt like he was doomed.The Cogmore said to its companion, Get your brothers and sisters together.Tell your mother Ive made my decision.If we succeed, well be free once more.So the other Cogmore was the leaders son or daughter, and he was sending in all of his children to infiltrate the Beetar base.The thought of a mother and father losing their children made him think about his own long dead father losing him.He knew how devastated he must have been, and it tore him up inside.Wait!he said.Its a trap.Once they think enough rebels are in close enough proximity to the buildings theyre going to nuke them and kill you all.The Cogmore looked at the ground.Then he looked back to his child and put a hand on its shoulder.We came very close to losing everything.Well hang back and wait to see what they do next.Spread the word that no one is to go near those buildings.His child blinked once and nodded before leaving the tent.The leader said to Zero, You could have let us all stumble into the trap.Why did you stop us?Ive lost loved ones.My father died thinking I had preceded him in death.You dont deserve that kind of sorrow.I dont know much about you or your people, but it seems clear that none of you deserve to die when all youre doing is fighting for freedom.Thats an odd stance for you to take.Machines like you have killed thousands of us.We thought you were the enemy.You attacked us so we fought back.My people are just doing their duty.Well, thank you anyway.He looked at him for an uncomfortably long time and finally seemed to make a decision.Im going to release you from your restraints.I trust you wont take advantage of my generosity and attempt to kill me or any of my people.I wont.Even if I did, I have nowhere to go now that my people have left the planet.So were your only friends, he said as he went around unlatching him from the boulder.He patted him on the head when he was done and stood back with the handheld device that could render Zero immobile.He said, Ill be carrying this around as a safety precaution until Im positive you pose no threat.I understand.Thank you.No, thank you.If we wouldve rushed the Beetar headquarters we wouldve been massacred.My entire civilization would be doomed to eternal slavery.As long as we can rebel, we can hope for a brighter tomorrow.Now I just need to find a way to trick the Beetars into thinking we are raiding their base so theyll launch their attack.
