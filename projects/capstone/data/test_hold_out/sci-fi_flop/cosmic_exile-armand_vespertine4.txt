They appear to be using some sort of Casimir force field to repel our attacks, Magnolia stated.At least, I think theyre Casimir force fields.What can we do about it?Arachnid asked.I dont know!Magnolia said trembling.She wasnt at all accustomed to combat situations.The Deity trembled as well.Another hit, Arachnid said.It appeared to be accompanied by a massive electromagnetic pulse.An EMP?Thats not going to have any effect on us, Ilene stated.Our outer hull is solid invictus.They mustnt know that, Marc surmised.Drkp, does their force field repel all matter indiscriminately?It does, he replied.So theyd have to shut it off in order to board us, right?Yes!Randi!Marc said.The next time one of those things hits us we have to cut power to all external systems to make it look like it worked.Make it happen, I dont care how!Yes sir!Randi replied, and immediately began issuing orders over the com and working rapidly at his console.Wont they wonder why the first two didnt work?Ilene asked.Hopefully theyll just think it was our shields, Marc replied.When they come in for the kill well open fire then run like hell.Drkp, show Arachnid any targets that will disable the ship without killing anyone.Aye sir, Drkp said as he ran to the security console.Once theyre in range well fire on these nerve clusters.That should take out their entire power grid, disabling weapons, propulsions, scanners and communications.Set the particle cannons to fire neutrons instead of hydrogen; it will do more damage.What about torpedoes?Arachnid asked.No, theyre too slow.Theyll be able to get their shields back up before they hit, Drkp explained with growing urgency.Another tremor shook through the ship.Playing dead sir!Randi announced as he cut the power to any system that the Scraumudi could tell was on.The plasma from the Deitys shields floated off into space and she appeared to be adrift, coasting on her own momentum.Levanochs behemoth slowly and silently straddled up from behind and hovered over top of them.Their force field is down, Arachnid said.Fire, Marc ordered.With a flip of a switch, Randi restored power to the deactivated systems, and every one of the Deitys particle cannons fired simultaneously.Within seconds the red hide of the Bloodwyrm with scorched and scarred with neutron blasts.As the Deity continued coasting forward, Levanochs ship merely floated down past it as if it were sinking down into the black abyss, and could make no attempt to stop its descent.Its adrift!Arachnid announced.Cheers and applause came from every member of the bridge crew.Kumar, keep heading for that Gas Giant!Marc ordered.Aye sir, Ill be able to jump to hyperluminal momentarily, Kumar replied.No sign of pursuit, from anyone, Arachnid reported.With elevated spirits and hope of escape, the Deity triumphantly soared away from the abhorrent Levanoch, plunging towards the ringed planet.Three      Levanoch tried to remain calm as his Commander read him the damage report.They spoke in their native language, a complex series of ear bleeding screeches and clicks.Most other races found it hideous, and at the moment even Levanoch found it irritating.The neutron radiation from their particle beams killed three prime ventral ganglia, which consequently overloaded the ships entire central nervous system, the Commander reported.He had never been given a name by the Reticulans.Indeed, they were almost certainly unaware of his existence.His Scraumudi name had a double meaning, for it meant both immortal and incorruptible.It would loosely translate into ancient Greek as Amarantos.The entire power grid is down.Independent power backups are keeping essential systems running.How long before we can go after them?Levanoch hissed.An hour, at the least Sire, Amarantos replied shamefully.They could escape by then!Levanoch cried, screaming in anger.Monitor the boundary closely.I want to know if any large scale wormholes open.We will Sire; as soon as the sensors are repaired, Amarantos replied hesitantly.What went wrong with the attack?It would appear the EMPs were ineffective.Perhaps their hull shields them from electromagnetic pulses.Amarantos was curious as to how Levanoch could have studied the Humans panplexus for four hundred years and still not have realized that the Deitys hull rendered her impervious to EMPs.He secretly suspected that after so many millennia, Levanochs mortal brain was finally beginning to succumb to dotage, but dare not voice such a thought aloud.Well have to try another means of neutralization before we attempt to board them again.Levanoch hung his head in frustration and slithered over to his window.Far, far away his sharp eyes could see the twinkle of his ghastly navy.I thought you said that these people were pacifists.Why does their ship even have weapons?Amarantos asked.Hypocrisy, Levanoch replied.The weapons are mainly meant as a deterrent.Even when they use them, their official policy is to never do any more damage than is absolutely necessary to neutralize their attackers.That is fortunate for us, otherwise we might not even be here right now.Sire, if I may, the Deitys chance of escape would be greatly reduced if we had one of our other ships search for her.Levanoch twisted around, and stared coldly at him.And what if they intercept her, and discover her power?What if they tell Nakhash what they found?he asked.Then all of this will have been for naught!And what do you think Nakhash will do to us when he learns that weve kept such secrets?Sire, there are captains loyal to you  None so loyal as those aboard this ship, Levanoch told him.Ive handpicked each of you not only for your loyalty to me, but for your hatred of Nakhash.If I knew any other officer that would obey me over him, he would be here right now.Do not forget it was Nakhash who led us to this Abyss, and it is I who will lead us out.Once I free us, all will swear loyalty to me, and I shall usurp Nakhashs sceptre and impale him upon it!He deserves no less.But you and I shall live forever.We will lead our people to an eternal golden age.We will consume world after world, galaxy after galaxy until we are the only race left in existence.With the resources of all the Cosmos at our finger tips, who knows what powers we will achieve?Maybe we will be able to create a new universe when this one dies, or preserve this one for all eternity.Under my reign, no Scraumudi will ever die again.But if Nakhash learns of our conspiracy, he will kill us!No my friend, I will not risk death.Tell the fleet that the Deity is under quarantine.We will deal with it and they are not to approach it.You have my authorization to destroy any ship that takes contrary action.Amarantos bowed in obedience, and then left Levanoch in solitude.***      Marc sat at the head of the conference table, and gazed out the window at the thick blue atmosphere of the gas giant.He had assembled the Deitys command staff before him.All right, he began slowly.Our first order of business should be to figure out how to escape from here, and then to prepare the ship and the crew for the possibility of being boarded.Creek, what else can you tell us about this place?Like I said before, it is a spherical region of normal space time about nine billion kilometers across, she replied.It has the same negligible curvature as space in our Universe, except at its outer edge.There the space is extremely curved, and if we went straight into it we would end up going around in a circle.The point where the normal space and the curved space meet appears to be where all of the large scale wormholes form.For those here without extensive knowledge of cosmology, a wormhole is in simplest terms a tunnel of three dimensional space through transdimensional space, connecting two distant points.Okay, transdimensional space?Ive heard the term before, but Im not exactly sure what it means, Ilene said.Transdimensional space refers to the higher dimensions required by Twin Theory.Were not aware of these extra dimensions because theyre less than subatomic in size, Magnolia explained.For example, imagine a single line.That one dimensional line represents our three dimensional Universe.Now imagine we magnified that line and it turns out its a really narrow cylinder.So it actually has two dimensions.The first is back and forth, and the second is around its circumference.This second dimension is tiny and curled up on itself, and it represents transdimensional space.Our Universe is represented by one line on the surface of that tube, and along the transdimensional axis theres room for parallel universes, which is what you could call this place.And by parallel universe, you mean a place where were all evil and have goatees?Ilene asked confused.Wellno, Magnolia replied.Youre thinking of alternate quantum realities, kind of, and those have been pretty thoroughly discredited.A parallel universe is simply a large region of three dimensional space that exists parallel with our Universe along the transdimensional axis.Even though they remain hypothetically possible, weve encountered races that have used artificial wormholes for interstellar, and more rarely intergalactic travel for thousands, sometimes even millions of years.Not a one of them has ever stumbled into a parallel universe.Theres no reason why a wormhole wouldnt be able to connect two parallel universes just as easily as it would be able to connect two points within the same universe.Virtually every cosmic anomaly weve ever observed has been claimed to be proof of parallel universes by some nut or another, but theyve usually been discredited and weve never found any real proof.We have thus drawn the conclusion that our Universe is not part of a multiverse, and there are not now nor have there ever been other universes with any kind of physical connection to our own.Any extra universal regions, like higher spiritual realities, are metaphysical in nature and outside of the realm of science.Were not only the first Humans, but also the first Sapient beings to our knowledge that have entered what could be called a parallel universe, aside from the Scraumudi themselves of course.However, since this place was artificially created by the Reticulans, its existence doesnt really alter our perspective of reality, either from a scientific or philosophical perspective.At least I dont think so.Hold on, Ilene said.Ive always understood that mass cant be created or destroyed, it can only change form.If any mass leaves the Universe, as we just did and this entire star system did ten thousand years ago, isnt that equivalent to mass being destroyed?Doesnt mass leaving the Universe violate the laws of physics?Well Levanoch said that this place isnt fully disconnected from our Universe, Helena recalled.He said that the particles that get sucked in still maintain their entanglements with particles in our Universe, and that theyve been using these entanglements to monitor our communication networks.Thats right.On the quantum level were still in the same space time continuum, Magnolia said.So does that mean our quantum transceivers would work?Arachnid asked.If they do, that means we could call for reinforcements,  It would take days for any other Anthropic ships to get here, Marc said.And if they came in here their hyperluminal drives wouldnt be powerful enough to let them escape.No, we cant get any help.What about Reticulan ships?Arachnid suggested.They can get here a hell of a lot faster and Im sure theyd have some way to get out.I have absolutely no idea how we could send a transmission to the outside Universe, Marc said.Its likely our first attempt would be intercepted by the Scraumudi, and theyd pinpoint our location.Drkp, if you know how to contact your people and you can find the time and resources to safely make an effort wed all be very appreciative.Creek, if you wouldnt mind continuing.Aye sir, she said.There are two basic kinds of traversable wormholes; eternal and evanescent.The space within both of them is crinkled in sine waves.This reduces the negative mass required to stabilize them to the point that its provided by vacuum fluctuations.No ones exactly sure how eternal wormholes form since the process has never been observed.Theyre believed to have formed in the very early Universe.Theyve expanded with the Universe, so theyre nearly always intergalactic in scale, and their mouths are usually found within galaxies since theyve remained gravitationally bound to them.Eternal wormholes do decay gradually, but at a rate thats utterly meaningless on a Human time scale.Theyll probably last until the end of the Universe.Our information on them is somewhat limited since every eternal wormhole known to exist is jealously guarded.We do know that the smaller an eternal wormholes mouth is the faster it collapses, so the more they shrink the faster they shrink.There are only three eternal wormholes known to exist in the Milky Way, one of which has a mouth that opens and closes intermittently.All eternal wormholes are naturally occurring, and no civilization that we know of has the ability to create them.Evanescent wormholes are very ephemeral by comparison.They come out of nowhere, last only a brief period of time and disappear just as quickly.Evanescent wormholes are constantly forming and evaporating in the quantum foam.Its possible to inflate these wormholes to macroscopic size by artificially manipulating the quantum foam.All large scale evanescent wormholes are artificial in nature.Probably the most significant difference between eternal and evanescent wormholes is that eternal wormholes always allow matter to travel both ways, whereas evanescent wormholes are always unidirectional.Every wormhole that forms here is evanescent, and theyre all incoming.Their spatial curvature doesnt let matter go back out.Its like a spider trying to climb out of a bathtub.Anything that goes in the wrong end just falls back out.But the hyperluminal drive of the Deity will be able to inverse the curvature of one of those quantum singularities and let us escape, right?Ilene asked.Im sorry, quantum singularities?Are you referring to the wormholes?Magnolia asked.Ahyeah, thats what I meant, she replied.Isnt a quantum singularity a hole in space?A quantum singularity is a mathematically defined infinitesimal point where gravity causes mass to become infinitely compressed, space time to be infinitely distorted, and the laws of physics essentially break down, Magnolia informed her.They have nothing to do with wormholes.Like, at all.Fine, whatever, just answer my question, Ilene said, getting frustrated.Can we get out of here?I believe so, Drkp replied.Ive completed my calculations and have determined the field parameters that should allow us to escape.However, I must point out that nothing is certain.This may not work.Thats all right Drkp, we know youve done your best and were very grateful, Marc said kindly.Why dont you brief us now on everything you think is relevant about the Scraumudi?Of course.As Levanoch told you, the Scraumudi are a race of bioengineered soldiers, Drkp began.They were created by a race known as the Telarri.Like you, they had engineered themselves to be a very peaceful people.To avoid conflict with other races they isolated themselves.They constructed the ring world in the dwarf galaxy NGC 6822, and lived there undisturbed for thousands of generations.But about fifteen thousand years ago, war came to them.They had no soldiers, so they decided to make the Scraumudi.They designed them to be everything they werent: vicious, ruthless, vindictive, sadistic, malevolent.They will descend upon their enemies and massacre them without hesitation, and without remorse.Not that Im taking Levanochs word over yours, but you do sound like youre just spouting propaganda, Ilene claimed.Youve never fought them in battle, Drkp told her.Their strength is hardly to be believed, and their stamina is infinite.Their exoskeleton is like armour and their talons are as deadly as any sword.They can see into the infrared and ultraviolet, and their hearing and smell are highly sensitive.That can sometimes be used against them.High frequency ultrasound waves can often cause enough pain to incapacitate them, though in combat they will most likely be wearing some form of protection.When you shoot at them always aim for their heads.Its unlikely youll hit a vital organ if you shoot their bodies.Ive seen a Scraumudi with an entire magazine shot into him and not even slow down.They are Sapient, but most of them are fairly obtuse.The Commanders were supposed to be more intelligent, but can still be very rigid in their tactical thinking.They always heavily favoured EMP weapons, even though theyre ineffective against properly fortified targets such as ourselves.If the Scraumudi have a weakness it is that their Commanders resent authority and are often found conspiring against one another.Thus, theyre justifiably paranoid and untrusting of each other.This discord between their leaders is the reason why the Scraumudi were never able to actually conquer any of the worlds they pillaged.It was also the Telarris hope that this would prevent them from staging a successful revolt.They were wrong.Eventually one such Commander decided he would no longer serve the Telarri.He is the Warlord of all Scraumudi.I now give him the name Nakhash, from the old Hebrew word for snake.He was quite a demagogue and quickly rallied his brethren to his cause.However the reason he has maintained power for all these millennia is through the Chrysalises.What are those?Marc asked.First you should understand that the Scraumudi originally had life spans between ten and twenty years, Drkp explained.Since they were expected to die in battle the Telarri saw no reason to give them long life spans.But Nakhash, he created the Chrysalises.They look like enormous cocoons.When a Scraumudi enters a Chrysalis, it rejuvenates every cell in his body, giving them indefinite life spans.A Chrysalis can repair any disease or physical injury, even resurrect the recently deceased.This comes at the price of physical addiction.If a Scraumudi were to go only a few days without sleeping in a Chrysalis he would start to experience debilitating withdrawal symptoms that would kill him in another few days; a week at the most.If you want to insure a Scraumudi will never come back from the dead you must completely destroy his body.Even without immediate access to a Chrysalis, the Scraumudi possess remarkable recuperative abilities.The promise of immortality is what allowed Nakhash to take such complete control over the Scraumudi, and its what assures their loyalty to him.He claims he is telepathically linked to the Chrysalises, that in making the first one he had to let a part of his very essence pass into it, in order to give it life.From that one Chrysalis all others are descended, and the essence passes into each new Chrysalis to animate it when it buds off from its parent, like one flame being used to light many more.Nakhash claims that if he were to die each of the Chrysalises would wither and die as well.We were never able to ascertain whether or not this is true, though they do have unusual psionic properties to them.The Scraumudi have an extremely necrophobic culture, not unlike yourselves.They believe a Scraumudis death at any age is a calamity, though they dont have the same respect for any other Sapient beings.They have no hope for an afterlife, and believe upon death their conscious selves vanish into nothing.The thought of not existing terrifies them.Their fear of death is great, so much that many of them have deluded themselves into believing that they will never die.This is why Nakhash has remained in power for so long.Though he is a tyrant, none of the Scraumudi will risk harming or killing him for it could mean their own death.Once Nakhash succeeded in turning all the Scraumudi against the Telarri it wasnt long before they had wiped them all out and laid waste to the ring world.Since the Scraumudi were designed to be ideal warriors and little else they could not maintain most of the Telarris technology, and it soon fell into disrepair.As Levanoch said this is why they began using biogenic technology.Their knowledge of biology and genetics is vastly superior to their knowledge of normal technology.Over the next five thousand years, they devoted themselves to creating biological systems with functions analogous to the Telarris technology, as well as augmenting it with the Telarri technology they could still produce and maintain.Their devotion has yielded impressive results.Since they are themselves the products of biogenic technology, this causes them to believe that it is inherently superior to conventional technology, which is of course ridiculous.This contempt for the technological runs deep in their society, and has no doubt contributed to their lack of technological progress.They spent those five millennia cultivating their society, bolstering their numbers and honing their martial skills.I hope you never have to see their ring world.The sky is completely overcast with ominous black clouds, always clattering with thunder and crimson lightning.The land is craggy and red, barren of all living things, swept with harsh and arid winds.The seas are choked with a kind of red algae.Its all that grows there, and its all the Scraumudi eat.The Scraumudi live in great towering pillars of black coral that reach heights of hundreds of meters.You might call them Dyson Trees.The Coral Cities are a ghastly sight.They look like a medusa head of twisted and gnarled bones, all as black as Hell.When we attempt to flee we will be attacked again, possibly by many more ships.We could not withstand such an onslaught.I recommend that once were clear of this planets gravity well we make a brief hyperluminal jump to the boundary.We would be too vulnerable at sub light speeds.The wormhole we came through should still be there.The projectiles they were shooting at us were dense slugs fired at high speed, augmented with EMPs.As you probably noticed they can only fire about one of those a minute.Since these failed to neutralize us earlier theyll likely try different tactics the next time.They are equipped with a form of directed energy weapons, but they would be inefficient at depleting our shields.Theyre more likely to use their other kinetic energy weapons.These will rapidly fire a hailstorm of small projectiles at us.If we are boarded they will presumably use non lethal force to capture us, as they require our knowledge of this vessel.You just said they were blood thirsty monsters, Ilene reminded him.Yes, but their bloodlust is not greater than their obedience to their Commander, Drkp explained.They were designed to the perfect soldiers, remember?If Levanoch orders them to capture us alive, they will do so.He would prefer that we remain both alive and complicit with his schemes.If they did kill us, couldnt they just resurrect us with their Chrysalises?Sook yin asked.No, the Chrysalises are specialized for Scraumudi, Drkp explained.They kill any other species that enters them.In fact, when a Scraumudi leaves a Chrysalis theyre sterilized of any bacteria or viruses.What about that thing at the back of the ship?Arachnid asked.What does it do?Well I think its partially for psychological effect, however its main purpose is a radiator, Drkp explained..So if their shields are down should we target it?Arachnid asked.I wouldnt make it a prime target.If you destroyed it, it would take some time before there would be any effect, Drkp replied.I have another question, Sook yin said.Nerve impulses only travel at a hundred meters a second.For an organism the size of those bioships, it should take almost half a minute for a nerve signal to get from one end to the other.Is that something we can take advantage of?No, the nervous system has been cybernetically enhanced, just like many other of the ships biological systems, Drkp explained.Theres no appreciable delay in the time it takes nerve signals to travel throughout the ship.All the ships systems are coordinated by a central brain.If that brain were disabled the ship would be thrown into chaos, though they would still have basic systems such as propulsion, sensors, life support, artificial gravity, maybe weapons.Every Scraumudi aboard that ship should have a telepathic uplink to that brain.This allows them to coordinate with each other with the efficiency of an insect colony, and gives them a direct neural interface with the ship.If the brain was disabled, and the telepathic interface suddenly severed, the Scraumudi would be thrown into a neuroleptic stupor, and it would take ten or fifteen minutes for enough of them to sufficiently recover to retake control of the ship.A more long term consequence of destroying the brain would be that without it to regulate the ships reactor it will become unstable within several days and eventually explode.However, the brain is deep within the vessel, and you couldnt reach it without doing serious damage to the rest of the ship.Do they have any kind of teleportation technology?Arachnid asked.No.Drkp, your knowledge is ten thousand years out of date, Ilene said.How do we know that anything youve told us is still relevant?How do you know the Scraumudi havent advanced in the last ten thousand years?Ten thousand years ago Humans were still in the stone age,  I know that.I was there, Drkp told her.But ten thousand years ago Reticulans were exactly as we are now.In all that time we have not changed technologically or culturally.We still have the same Empress.People dont like to suffer, so advanced races do everything they can to prevent suffering.They control the weather, wipe out diseases, and create inter government organizations to prevent wars.
