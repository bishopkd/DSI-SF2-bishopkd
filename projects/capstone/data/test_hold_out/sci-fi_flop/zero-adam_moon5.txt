They waited patiently while he scurried around frantically to get squared away.Henshaw finally returned to the room with her taking up the rear.She regarded them coolly, like she barely knew what to make of the situation or of the wide eyed mechs staring back at her.Henshaw took a seat as she stood front and center of the room.The doctor filled me in on what happened to you.Well find out which species did that to the camp and punish them accordingly.Luckily, you all led your class, so Im going to recommend that you be given assignments rather than wait until the camp can be rebuilt.Henshaw looked like he wanted to jump up and run around the room, but he contained his enthusiasm.The ambassador looked at them seriously.The Beetar ambassador has been informed of the situation, and he agrees.In fact, he wants us to stick to our original plan and send two recruits out to his warship.He wanted me to send him two of the more qualified candidates, but hes confident that two of you will be sufficient.She stared at the numbers on their chest plates and pointed to Piss pants and Stacey.You two led your class, so both of you will be stationed on the warship.Youll travel with me when I leave here.Henshaw stood up slowly.He looked upset.With a quavering voice he said, Zero showed some promise in training too.Would it be possible to station him there instead?The ambassadors brow wrinkled.Her voice raised an octave.Ive made my damn decision.I didnt ask for your opinions.Sit down.Stacey looked at Zero out of the corner of her eye.He couldnt tell if she was happy hed written the number one on her chest or not, but there was no doubt that his actions had gotten her the post onboard the warship.The ambassador said, As for the rest of you, were prepared to station you on a Beetar controlled planet not far from here.Youll act as enforcers to put down rebellions and maintain civility among its alien residents.Dont worry about your lack of training.Youll be taught by the others already stationed there.That didnt sound too bad, but his enthusiasm was short lived when she added, You will be launched from this space station and take up orbit around the planet in about a month.There, youll be picked up and brought to the surface.But heres the part you wont like: you wont be in a ship.Your bodies can withstand the rigors of space on their own.The good doctor will prep you and then launch you bodily.She smiled when they were rendered speechless.Zero was the first to break the silence.Screw you.I wont do that.She looked over at the doctor and Henshaw turned to him.Youll do whats asked of you.I will empty your fluid systems prior to launch and your consciousness will be turned off for the duration of the trip.Weve done it plenty of times.It is nearly risk free.The planet isnt far from here.Its in this very star system, so you dont have very far to travel.To the ambassador, he said, Itll be done.Dont worry about it.She nodded and then pointed at Stacey and Piss pants.Follow me.Well launch in a moment.She walked from the room, but neither Stacey nor Piss pants made a move to follow her.Henshaw rushed forward and said in agitation, Hurry up.We got very lucky just now.Dont blow it.Stacey gave Zero a hug.She was trembling, even though she was a mech and trembling was not part of her programming.She whispered, Ill see you when our assignment is over.It was part statement and part question.He said, Well meet again soon.Go on now.She followed after Piss pants, and Zeros heart went still.Volts said to Henshaw, Youd better have a plan, because Im not about to let you shoot me into space without a ship.Henshaw shook his head.You dont understand.This is a best case scenario.She didnt even double check to see if our story was true.The alternative might have been scrapping the lot of you.Please be grateful for such good fortune.Zero felt no gratitude.The doctor was nuts if he thought they should kiss his ass for this.The doctor was supercharging them to make sure they had enough juice to last almost a month in a hibernation state while they ripped through space.When they were fully charged, he fitted each of them with an array of jets that could correct their trajectory should something knock them off course.He said, If even the smallest asteroid or rogue body was to interfere with your linear course, you could end up floating through space forever.If he was trying to alleviate their fears, he sure had an odd way of doing it.Henshaw picked up on their apprehension and added, The chances of any of you crossing paths with anything larger than stardust are infinitesimally small, but why take the chance.Volts stared at the floor the entire time the doctor was speaking, and Eve kept shaking her head.Henshaw whispered to Zero, Should the opportunity arise, Ill make sure you get posted aboard the warship.Its a great honor and I wish youd been picked for it.Why do you care about me more than the others?Stacey and Piss pants are way more qualified to serve on the warship than Ill ever be.The doctor looked away, which Zero was starting to realize was his tellhe was about to lie.Your body was modified.Its superior to the others.I just wanted to show it off.Maybe that was the truth, but Zero doubted it.He had yet to show any signs of performing better than his fellow mechs, and in some cases he significantly underperformed.Volts shouted to Henshaw, I want to see my real body before you launch us.I want to be reminded of what Im doing this crazy shit for.Henshaw stared at Eve and Volts and said, Your bodies are six months from being ready.If I interrupt the sequence for even a moment to show you your bodies, the program will have to start all over again.Its against protocol to let you near them and I just wont allow it.Zero spoke up.How long before mine is done?Your body has only been here for days.Youll be in the program for a substantially longer amount of time than your friends, because theyre almost done.My best estimate is ten months, but thats because Im an optimist.Dont be surprised if youre here for as long as a year and a half to two years.Shit.Sorry.He asked a question he shouldve asked before he ever agreed to any of this: Can I go back to Earth when Im cured?Of course you can.But do you really want to?Theres a whole big, mysterious galaxy out here tailor made for a young man with a new lease on life.Zero would have to consider his options.The Earth had probably changed in major ways since the last time hed seen it eight hundred years ago.And if he decided to go back, hed have to go back into stasis for another eight hundred years.The Earth might not even be fit for life by the time he got there.Hed have a better idea of his options after his assignment was over and hed seen another planet or two.Maybe there was a paradise out here perfectly suited to him.Maybe Stacey would decide it suited her too.But that was a wistful dream he had to make sure didnt rule his thoughts.He liked Stacey.He wanted to get to know more about her.However, he had no idea if the feeling was mutual, so it was stupid to dream up a phony scenario based on no facts whatsoever.He held out hope that their shared experiences would draw them closer over time  if he ever saw her again.Henshaw unhooked them from their chargers and said, Its time.The planet youll arrive at is called Cogmore.Its temperate and fairly pleasant considering how hostile its inhabitants are.And lucky for you, its in this very star system.Try to catch up to the other mechs already stationed theremake sure to stick to your cover storiesand youll be alright.Come with me to the launch bay so we can drain your system fluids and put you in sleep mode.Dont worry.Ive done this dozens of times before.Volts looked like he wanted to run and hide.Eve looked pissed that shed been forced into this predicament.Zero was just really apprehensive.They followed the doctor to the launch bay, where one by one he shut them down.Zero was the last to go dark.Right as the doctor was making the final adjustments, he heard the doctor say to him, You might be our only chance.Then everything turned black.Zero asked, What does that mean?But he was already in orbit above a green and blue planet and the doctor and the space station were nowhere in sight.His question evaporated in a heartbeat as he stared at the slowly tumbling orb of a planet beneath him.He was space debris.He was helpless.He hoped someone would come and get him like the doctor had said they would.Part 3:  Cogmore    He saw the ship approaching from behind.A jet on his left side loosed a burst to adjust his trajectory so his orbit wouldnt decay.If Cogmore was as large as the Earth, then he was probably traveling in orbit at around seventeen thousand miles an hour just to keep from falling inward.The ship was closing on him, so it was traveling even faster than that.A large door opened when it was near enough for him to make out details.A mech was inside, fiddling with something he couldnt quite make out.Then he saw it toss something his way like he was throwing a dart.A steel cable.It got close enough to grab, so he got hold of it as tightly as he could and waited to see what would happen next.The cable went taut.His grip was loose and weak, but it was enough.He started moving towards the ship, and when he got close he saw that the other mech was none other than his buddy Volts.Eve was standing behind him, coiling up the cable as he fed it back to her.Volts smiled when he took his hand and pulled him all the way in.He tried to shake his hand, but he couldnt move.He fell over as though hed been shut off.Volts pulled him along the floor enough to allow the door to shut.The atmosphere hissed, filling the room.Eve said, Hold on.Ill refill your system fluids.Then youll be able to move a little better.She fetched a thick hose and hooked it beneath his chest plate.He felt the liquid filling his robotic veins and his body began to feel normal once more.He slowly stood up, careful not to do too much too soon.Volts clapped him on the shoulder and Eve gave him a hug.Volts said, Youre late, dude.We thought you were a goner.How late am I?You shouldve arrived yesterday, when we both got here.Maybe I went off course like the doctor worried we might.Isnt that just about the scariest thought imaginable?He was right.The notion sent a phantom shiver through him.He had been on a space adventure that he would never know about.But at least hed made it to his destination.Eve said, We need to strap in.The ship is already tipping landward.Volts said, We received a transmission from down there just a few hours ago that if you didnt arrive in another day we would be brought landside without you.I guess I made it here just in time.Come on.Well be grinding against the atmosphere in a few minutes.He followed Eve and Volts to a small chamber with a dozen spots along the walls to strap in.He watched Eve slip her harnesses over her body and he did the same.Then the turbulence hit and he was glad to be secured to the ship.There were no windows or monitors to watch their descent, and for that he was thankful.It was violent.He wondered how well built he really was.Would his components vibrate loose with enough turbulence?The ship started to slow down, and then listed to its side as it corrected to take them to their eventual destination.Several loud bangs startled them.It sounded like the ship was being fired upon.The ship shuddered when it finally touched down.They released their straps and walked back to the door Volts and Eve had pulled him through.They waited there to see what would happen next.When the door finally opened, he stepped backwards in reaction to the absurd sight before him.A human wearing a gasmask was standing beside a severe looking Beetar and a mech that towered over them both.The mech was the scariest thing any of them had ever seen.It had rust spots all over and dents all across its body.But worse, its entire left side was coated in fresh, sticky blood, and the rest of it was stained a dull, faded brown, no doubt from blood that couldnt be washed off entirely.Several plates covering it looked to be newer than the rest, meaning it had sustained enough damage to need repair.Everything about it inspired awe, as well as a healthy dose of fear.Behind those three was the weirdest little alien imaginable, gray, with black and white mottling on its skin.It had a single circular, lidless eye in the center of its flat face, with an iris as green as an emerald.If it had a nose or ears, they werent immediately evident.It had a tiny mouth that was nothing more than a thin slit below its big green eye, and was wearing a colorful robe that covered its entire body, so they had no idea what it looked like underneath.It was about five feet tall and it sort of bobbed up and down as it watched them.They assumed it was one of the indigenous inhabitants of Cogmore.The Beetar stared at them disapprovingly, or so Zero thought, and then turned and walked away.They were in a large aircraft hangar with an open roof.Besides their landing ship, the hangar was empty.The human lifted his gasmask and wheezed, Follow me inside.I cant breathe this filthy air.The mech bowed to them and said with an air of authority born of experience, Hurry up.The ships automatic.Itll take off with you on it if you stay there.The gray alien stared at them.It was impossible to tell from its face what it was thinking.They stepped from the ship and followed after the human in the gasmask and his alien companion.The mech stayed put as the ship lifted off.As soon as the ship rose through the roof opening, they heard several pops.Zero turned around and saw projectiles bouncing off the exterior of the ship as it rose.He was right.When theyd descended into the atmosphere, the ship had been fired upon.The mech crouched down and then leapt high into the air.Before it started to fall, its metal feet lit up like the sun and it lifted into the sky.Before it vanished through the roof opening, it reached for its guns.Zero had never seen anything so impressive in his entire life.It was a robot built for battle, and eager for it too.It swerved out of view and then he heard its hand cannons blasting away relentlessly.It was killing the Cogmores who had attacked the ship.Volts said, I wonder when well get cool rocket boosters like that.The human removed his gasmask and his expression was full of confusion.What do you mean?Theyre already built in to your unit.Dont you know that?They didnt, but it was exciting to find it out.The mech appeared at the roof opening once more, and was about to descend when it was hit with a shot.It spun around lightning fast and whooshed from sight again.They didnt wait around for it to return.Once they left the hangar, the guy in the gasmask waved off his alien counterpart and it scurried off through a doorway like a pet.He then removed his mask and they walked down one long hallway after another until they came to an office.The guy took a seat behind the only desk in the room and they stood before him, waiting to see what he had to say.He laid the gasmask on his desk beside two others just like it.My name is General Parsons and Im in command.I used to be just like you.I had an inoperable brain tumor on Earth, but our humble benefactors fixed me up and gave me a new chance at life.After my commitment to them was up, I decided to stay on and help in any way I could.It sounded empty, like a speech hed reiterated a thousand times.On closer inspection the general wasnt much older than Zero.He was in his mid twenties, prematurely balding, with faint crows feet wrinkles that painted a picture of a man whod lived too fast too soon.He picked up a coffee cup, sipped from it, scrunched up his face, and spat the contents back into the cup.This place is a hellhole.Thats why youre here.I have to admit how disappointed I am that there are just three of you.I was expecting eight trained soldiers, not three untrained bozos.He glared at them like it was their fault.Eve said sarcastically: Well, its nice to be appreciated.Shut up.You have so little time to prepare for this place that Ill be surprised if all of you survive long enough to get any good at your job.But I also understand that this is not your fault, so Im going to invest some time getting you trained up.It would be murder if I set you loose without the basic essentials to defend yourselves.I have four soldiers at my disposal here, which means Im desperately undermanned already, but Im going to dedicate one of them to training you three.Itll be accelerated training thatll focus only on combat and survival.Zero was starting to get excited.If he could do half of what that mech in the hangar could, he was about to become a veritable superhero.Parsons keyed a desk mounted radio and said into it, Jackson, come to my office.The new arrivals are here.A moment went by before a masculine voice returned over the speaker: Shit.I was kind of hoping the Cogmores would blow their ship out of the sky so I wouldnt have to do this.Parsons chuckled.I hear you.Get your ass in here.Jackson had char marks on his torso and several dents from bullet hits across his metal frame.He said, Come on, troops.Ive got something special set up for you.Parsons stared into his coffee mug with a disgusted look on his face, now ignoring them completely.Jackson smirked at his commander and then ushered them from the office with an impatient wave of his hand.The same Beetar whod greeted them when they landed walked past.Jackson bowed his head low but they were caught unprepared, so they didnt get a chance to follow suit.The Beetar regarded them coolly, but it said nothing.As soon as it was out of earshot, Jackson turned on them.Didnt they teach you etiquette?You bow when your saviors pass you by.Do you understand me?They nodded.It wasnt their fault they didnt know that yet.He shook his head angrily.Were here.Its time to prove your mettle.Inside the room was a gathering of those little gray aliens.They were naked, which caused Eve to gasp and Volts to mumble something under his breath.They had upper bodies similar to humans in that they had two arms and a flat torso with few distinguishing features.But the lower half of their bodies was a tangled mess of thin tendrils, gray and semi opaque.There were thousands or maybe millions of them, pencil thin and three feet long.Some of them moved while others stayed rooted to the spot.There was nothing on Earth Zero could compare them to except maybe a box jellyfish, but even that was a weak comparison.He couldnt help but wonder if their many skinny tentacles were poisonous too.Jackson said, These are Cogmore criminals.The Beetar garrison has sentenced them all to death for various crimes.I want you three to carry out the executions.Zero gasped and shook his head.Volts said, No way.Eve whispered, Thats murder.I wont.Jackson sneered.You will do it, whether you want to or not.It seems barbaric now, but give this place a few months and youll wish you could kill all of these sons of bitches.The gray aliens stared at them like they were devils.Their single eyes watered, but Zero couldnt tell if they were tears or if they just did that all the time.In an act of desperation, Eve asked, Dont you want to give us a tour of the facility first, or show us our living quarters?Jackson laughed, but there was little humor in it.He pulled a handgun out and tossed it to the crowd of naked Cogmores.At first the aliens just stared after the firearm suspiciously, but then they all made a dive for it at once.One of them came up with it and aimed it at Zero.Automatically, the hatches in his thighs opened, giving him access to his weaponshis programming, fixed by Henshaw, doing what it was supposed to do.Volts and Eve were ready to defend themselves as well.The alien seemed to be in two minds about what he or she should do next.It stared at the gun and then flung it at its feet as if it were electrified.It understood enough about them to know that they would respond in ways detrimental to its health if it continued threatening them with bodily harm.It was a smart little guy.Zero sighed with relief when his hatches slammed shut.Jackson looked disgusted by both the aliens and the mechs.He took a giant step towards the aliens and nudged the gun nearer to them with his mammoth foot.When no one picked it up, he pulled his other handgun and shot the alien whod thrown it down in the center of its chest.It fell over slowly as the others tried to move out of the way.Then Jackson stepped back and waited for them to take the hint: they could go out fighting a futile battle against them or they could give themselves over to their fate.Either way they were going to die.One of them would take a step forward only to hesitate and step back again.Some of them were shaking.Jackson tired of their indecisiveness, so he shot another one.The newly arrived mechs watched in utter horror as he loomed over the little creatures, carrying out his sadistic tortures.Zero looked at Volts, who had an expression of confusion and terror.They were way outside their comfort zone.Eve looked to be in a fugue state.Her mind couldnt handle what she was seeing.Zero just couldnt stand it anymore.The Cogmores were terrified and there was no escape for them.They could die immediately without all of the suspense, or they could play Jacksons game and let him get his kicks out of their fear and reluctance.In the end, theyd die anyway.His hatches slid open and he grabbed his guns.He started to fire into the crowd.His aim was perfect, hitting each Cogmore center mass, killing them instantly.When the last one fell, he put his guns away, walked up to Jackson, and punched him in his face.Is that what you wanted, you piece of shit?Well, there you go.Theyre all dead.Lets move on.Jackson slapped him on the back good naturedly.Good job.When he turned to face them, Volts and Eve were casting awkward glances back and forth.He said, Im sorry.That asshole would have toyed with them and basked in their terror until we killed them.I figured why should I give him the pleasure?Volts said, You did the right thing under the circumstances, but its a bit of a shock.Ive killed too, but never defenseless creatures like that.Eve added, It had to be done, but Zero thought she was just trying to convince herself of it.He holstered his guns and the hatches clicked shut.He hung his head in shame.He was no killer.But they had no choice in the matter.Had he stalled, they wouldve had to watch as Jackson humiliated and tortured every last one of them.The reasoning did little to alleviate his guilt.Jackson laughed.Youre all so glum.You passed the first and hardest part of your combat training.Cheer up.Come on, Ill show you to your living quarters.Zero wanted to put a bullet in the back of his head as he led the way.As they walked, Jackson said, One day youll be asked to take new troops to execute Cogmore criminals like I just did with you.When that day comes, youll be ready.I know you can barely imagine it, but its true.Youll hate them with all of your hearts.Eve cleared her throat and asked, What did those criminals do?Zero thought she was hoping to hear they were all serial killers or rapists.That would make her feel better about what hed done.Jackson shrugged nonchalantly.The Beetars judge them.We just carry out the sentencing.The living quarters were even shoddier than their topside base back at Epigog.Recharge ports hung from the walls; the floor was littered with trash and broken objects that looked like lighting fixtures.He looked up and saw there was only one working light on the ceiling, the two that sandwiched it burnt out or otherwise unlit.A voice issued from speakers somewhere nearby.It was Parsons voice.Jackson, the unit named Zero may rest, but the other two need to prove themselves immediately.Bring them back to the execution chamber.Eve said, What the hell does that mean?Jackson smirked.It means youre not off the hook yet.She said, I wont do it.You cant make me.Jackson sighed.Every new arrival must prove themselves.I assumed Parsons would give you guys a break because youve been through so much already, and because your training was cut way short, but I guess I was wrong.Come on.Ill fetch us some more victims.Eve and Volts looked to Zero to help them, but there was nothing he could do.In fact, they were more advanced than he was, so they should really be guiding him, not vice versa.He had never proven himself.He had made it through just one day of training before washing out.Then the only time the defenses on Epigog had ever been overrun by an invader had happened during his tenure.He hadnt even made it into orbit around Cogmore on time.He was a reject in every way imaginable, and in his book hed failed the last test too, because hed slaughtered unarmed civilians.As they left him alone, he felt the loneliness seeping through his circuits.He wasnt sure what kind of man he would be when it was time to upload back into his human body, but he was sure he would be far more jaded and heartless than the man he started out as.They would fix his body but they would break his mind.He stood against the wall and waited for Volts and Eve to return.He considered etching a hash mark into the wall to start his countdown to freedom, but hed been given no specific end date, so that was futile.The mean looking mech that had greeted them upon arrival walked into the room.He said, Im Mike.I heard you passed the first test but those other rejects failed out.Good work, soldier.Youll do just fine here.Thanks.When will we begin our assignments?I dont know.Weve never received a bunch of unproven cadets before, so I dont know if or when youll be ready.Thats for Parsons to decide.That hurt his feelings.Did you kill those aliens that shot at the ship?Mike smiled wickedly.There was genuine joy in his voice when he said, Those dirty little bastards keep it up even though they know Ill turn them into spaghetti.Theyre the dumbest bunch of backwoods aliens you could ever hope to kill.I got about two dozen of them, but that doesnt mean its over.Others will seek retribution for those deaths, so theyll keep sending meat into my grinder.He paused and looked him up and down as though he was evaluating him on the spot.I cant blame them for trying to take down the ship, though.They know reinforcements come in that ship, so it only makes sense for them to try and destroy it.Mike pulled a huge box away from the wall and flipped the lid open.Inside was enough ammo to take down God and all his angels.He grabbed his left forearm with his right hand and jiggled it around.His forearm opened like a door.He started to insert the ammo into the opening, then did the same to the other arm.He gestured for Zero to come closer.He stepped forward and Mike asked, Did they show you how to reload?No.We didnt get far enough in training.Mike snorted and said, Try it yourself.Youre already programmed to know what to do.He was right.As soon as Zero grabbed his forearm, he knew how it all worked.The ammo fed up through his arm, into the palms of his hands, and then directly into the guns.He filled both arms until he could fit no more in.Mike said, Youll be refilling a lot on this planet.Those Cogmores are relentless.Why do they hate you so much?Who cares?This is our assignment and theres no point second guessing its merits.The Beetars are trying to civilize the Cogmores, and the only way to do that is to force civility down their throats.Thats where we come in.If we do our job we get our bodies back better than they were when we left them.Its a good gig that benefits everyone.Zero nodded, even though he was pretty sure the Cogmores werent getting much benefit from it.Then again, there were numerous instances in human history where a more advanced civilization forced its values and practices upon a backwards one and both sides gained in the end, so maybe this would work out for all involved.But getting to that eventuality could be bloody.History books tended to omit or gloss over how many of the conquered had to die before their people embraced the foreign ideals of their conquerors.It took some of the polish off of the boots that marched towards progress.Then again, history wasnt his forte so maybe he had it all wrong.He just didnt have enough information to form an opinion yet.And maybe Mike was right, maybe it was better to just do what was expected than to question everything.My names Zero.The other guy is Volts and the girls name is Eve.Mike cocked his head to the side, probably trying to figure out if he was pulling his leg.Then he said, Youll do well here, Zero.Im going to charge up while theres some downtime.Ill see you when I wake up.He said, Okay, and watched Mike go to the furthest port and plug in.His body slumped against the wall and his head hung low.Once again, he was alone.Jackson returned an hour later with Eve and Volts in tow.As if they were lifelong buddies, he said to Zero, These two cowards got it done eventually.I thought I was going to have to execute the entire lot and bring in a fresh crop, but they got the hint and did their part before I ran through them all.He clapped Zero on the shoulder, and when he saw Mike charging said, I see you met Mike.Hes great.Its our down day so youll be seeing us around all day today.Tomorrow youll meet Kathy and Winthrop.Winthrops a tool, but watch out if he gets angry.Youll see what I mean soon enough, Im sure.Im going to charge up since theres nothing going on.If Parsons calls for me, could you unplug me?Zero nodded, wondering why the training had ended so abruptly.He thought it was supposed to be an accelerated crash course.Jackson plugged in and his body wilted.Volts said, We ought to kill him where he stands.Eve nodded.Jacksons head shot up and he turned on Volts.Only then did they notice he hadnt actually plugged himself all the way in.If you think you can take me, come on!Volts took a step towards him, but Zero shoved him back.Hes doing his job.Let it go.If you kill one of our own, youll be punished.Jackson laughed heartily.That coward could never kill me.These suits are awesome, but only when theyre being piloted by warriors.That wimp is a waste of a suit.Volts hand went down to his thigh, searching for his gun.But the hatch wouldnt open.Jackson laughed again.You idiots truly are untrained fools, arent you?You cant deploy your weapons against friendlies.We learned that in our first week of training.Apparently I have my work cut out for me with you guys.Zero still had a hand on Volts chest.Just let it go, dude.Let him charge and well talk.Volts slapped his arm away like he was the bad guy.He walked over to the other end of the room and sat down against the wall.Jackson smirked and plugged into the port, all the way this time.When they were sure Jackson was offline, Eve said, He gunned them down, one after the other, saying hed keep bringing in new fodder until we did our duty.It was awful, Zero.Volts and I killed more of them than you did, and Jackson told us afterwards that our victims werent even criminals.We killed innocents because we didnt have what it took to do what had to be done the first time around.He put an arm around her waist and walked her toward Volts.She sat down and Zero sat between them both.Volts wouldnt look them in the eyes.He was a shell of his former, confident self, and it broke Zeros heart to see such a rapid decline in him.Eve picked up one of the fallen ports and handed it to him.Youll need to charge up soon.Volts said viciously, No I dont!Im fixed now, remember?Im no different than anyone else.Eve put the port down gently and stared at the filthy floor.Im sorry.I forgot.Zero picked the port up and jammed it into Volts back before he could stop him.He instantly went limp.He explained to Eve, Hes always in better spirits after a charge.She tried to smile, but she couldnt manage it.She said sheepishly, Im going to plug in too, then, if thats okay with you?He hated to be left alone again, but there was no way he could deny her when it was so clear she needed to get out of her own head for a while.She plugged in before he responded, so it was probably for the best that he was about to tell her to go ahead and do it.Misery loves company, but so does failure, and they had all failed their humanity by executing innocent strangers.Hed been a very sad and lonely robot lately, but it was worse this time.He stood up and took one last look around before leaving the inanimate mechs to go explore the facility.With no one to talk to, he had to change his perspective and get out of his own mind for a little while.He wandered the corridors, peering inside rooms as he went.Some of the rooms held Cogmore prisoners while others were completely empty.He saw an opulent room with large ornate doors.The doors were open so he had a look inside.The Beetar whod met them when they landed was standing at an alien console in the center of the room.It saw him staring at it, so he averted his gaze and bowed his head.He turned to walk away when he heard a squelching sound that coalesced into words.What are you doing?He turned back and sheepishly said, Im new here.I was just taking in my surroundings.Im sorry for disturbing you.You humans are so curious.I understand you were one of the survivors of the training camp attack on Epigog.Yes.He felt like the Beetar wanted him to elaborate, but he was worried hed dig himself a hole he wouldnt be able to pull himself out of if he said more.Were still looking for the perpetrators of the attack.Theyve gone dark, but theyll surface eventually.Again, he wanted to interject, but according to his cover story hed been charging when the attack occurred, so he kept his mouth shut to avoid putting his foot in it.The Beetar said, My name is Thrimmel.Im in charge of this facility.Im Zero.Its good to meet you.Yes.You may go.He walked away unsure of whether he liked the Beetar or not.He had the feeling that hed annoyed him with his mere presence.After another couple minutes of walking he saw a room packed wall to wall with Cogmores.It was a holding cell of some kind.He wanted to let them out, but his presence had them scrambling away from the door in fear.Parsons voice came from a nearby speaker.Mike, bring the new meat to my office.Youd better not be sleeping, you lazy sack of shit.Zero was the only one of them who could hear the message, so he quickly walked back to the living quarters and unplugged everyone except Jackson.He told Mike that Parsons wanted him to bring them to his office.On the way there, Volts grabbed his arm.Thanks for plugging me in.I feel a bit better now.Eve added, Me too.Im still a little shaky, but Ill get over it.He said, Next time I get to charge and one of you guys can stay awake.He was mad theyd gotten over what theyd done so easily while he was still despondent.Parsons was standing when they arrived.He said to Mike, Next time I call, youd better move faster than this.Mike smiled as if he didnt give a damn.Parsons asked, Were you asleep?Nope.Liar.He cleared his throat.I need you to take these guys out on patrol.Thats not safe.Nothings safe here.Fine.But Ill choose the location.Fine.They followed Mike out to the hangar, where he stopped them.When you arrived, I noticed you were surprised by my boosters.Do you know how to operate yours?Volts said, We didnt get that far in our training.Its easy.Do what I do.Then Mike jumped high into the air and the bottom of his feet sparked to life.He hovered for a second and then fell back to the floor with a clang.Zero jumped, but his heart wasnt in it and it showed.Nothing happened.Volts leapt higher than he did and his feet lit up, but he lost his balance right before his boosters gave out and he fell over onto his side.Eve smirked at Mike when he turned to her, but she complied and succeeded.She hovered five feet above the floor until Mike said, Good job.Now turn it off.She did and she hit the ground with a loud thud.Mike said, If you use it too long youll run out of propulsion and fall out of the sky like a stone.Its happened to me before and its not pretty.You have about ten minutes of constant use.When you run out, you need to wait for your internal systems to create more from the air around you.Zero assumed they had something within their bodies that separated oxygen out of the air, or maybe something even more flammable, and stored it.Mike said, Try again until you have it down.The boosters give us a tactical advantage over the Cogmores, so they are our most useful tool.He jumped as high as he could, and as if on cue, the bottoms of his feet opened up and shot out thick streams of fire.He hovered there and asked, Why are the boosters flammable?Dont concentrated jets of air work just as well or better?Mike chuckled.Its a toss up.But flaming boosters can be used as weapons where jets can not.Zero imagined burning a frightened Cogmores face off with his feet, and the mental image broke his concentration.His boosters flickered and he fell awkwardly to the ground.Not to be outdone, Volts jumped up and stayed there.Then he rose higher and started to bank this way and that, showing off.Mike said, Thats good, man.Were ready to go and put some fear into these scurrying insects.Lets go.Mike went over to the closest wall and hit a big red button.The overhead doors slid open.Then he jumped up and his boosters lit, taking him higher.He zipped from view once hed cleared the hangar doors.Volts looked at Zero and then Eve.He shrugged and jumped, his boosters carrying him through the doors too.Zero waited for Eve to go next.He thought it was the chivalrous thing to do, although he was not sure why he thought that.Sure, she was a girl, but she was piloting a mech that could tear a tank in half.She jumped, and after a brief hiccup where she listed too far to the right, she vanished too.He leapt up and felt himself rising.Once above the hangar, he took in the scene.The planet wasnt much more hospitable than Epigog 31, although this planet at least had indigenous life.He could see smoke from a few fires off in the distance, and smelled rotten produce in the air.No building was higher than a single story, and most of them looked like lean tos.A shanty town as far as the eye could see.Most of it looked to be abandoned.He mustve hovered in one spot for too long because he was hit with gunfire.Before he could react, he saw Mike zoom past him, and then he heard his guns go off.A moment later Mike was beside him yelling, Move it, asshole!
