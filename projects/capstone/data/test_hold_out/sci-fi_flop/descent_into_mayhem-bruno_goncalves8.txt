.The earthling lay on his side and promptly fell asleep.After a while, Toni felt the need to move, and so he quietly stood and began his usual slow circuits of the camp.Twenty seven circuits later, Kaiser awoke again.Sergeant, I am afraid I need to relieve myself once more.With my age there is no choice, yes?Toni helped him to his feet and directed him to the predetermined watering spot.As he was about to unbind his prisoners wrists, a sound from behind caught his attention.Quickly he turned.Something swished over his head and suddenly his own rifle strap was constricting his throat.Desperately he grabbed at the strap with his only working hand, but a vicious kick behind his knee caused him to buckle and the pressure instantly doubled.Unable to breathe, seeing starbursts as he desperately tried to make noise, any noise, he was suddenly being dragged deep into the forest.Giving up on the strap, he tried instead to grab hold of Kaisers fingers, but the earthlings slender digits contracted into an impossibly solid fist.Toni blacked out, wondering whether they would ever find his body.He was still unable to see when he finally realized he was still alive.We are alive, yes?a satisfied voice asked him.Whuffah   Yes we are, it replied in satisfaction.Tonis throat was suddenly being constricted once more, and again he was being dragged along the forest floor.He had enough time to ask himself why he wasnt dead yet before he blacked out again.He slowly returned to consciousness, his asphyxiated mind wondering when the Click would ever end.Hello, my boy.We are alive, yes?Toni began to dread what came next and attempted to beg for mercy.plagh!Aah, there we are, said the voice, positively delighted.Toni was once again being dragged through the forest, the constricting strap ever tighter around his throat.Toni tried hard to think.Next time, he decided, next time Ill ...Slowly, Toni returned to consciousness, still blind, aware only of the rustling of leaves as someone or something moved around him.His arms were bound behind his back around what felt like a tree and something had been shoved into his mouth.Breathing hard, the creature approached Tonis ear.Well, my fine young sergeant.It seems we are still alive.Toni braced himself to be suffocated, but it didnt happen.Instead, the voice spoke again.I must apologize for this treatment, since it is not in my nature.However, if I am to effect an escape, well, I will need to run very much indeed, will I not?I must apologize as well for the things I am about to do.They are terrible, yes, and you are only kinders, but this is a matter of justice, ya?Casually, Kaiser pulled Tonis dagger from the sheath on his vest.In that moment Toni remembered that he had been armed with the weapon.Then he remembered the sidearm in his vests side pocket and began to hate himself fiercely.Thank you, this is a good weapon.My first debt is the one I have to you ...Toni suddenly regained vision as Kaiser removed the MEWAC undershirt from his head.The earthling held Tonis head firm and slashed him across the side of his face.Letting go as Toni screamed into the cloth in his mouth, the major observed his work with grim satisfaction.Turning about, he paused and spoke over his shoulder.I hope your arm rots off and you are unable to fight ever again, because if we ever cross paths again you will most certainly die.Now I really must pay your murderer friend a visit ...He abandoned the clearing at a casual pace, leaving his prisoner to bleed.SIXTEEN      North west of the mining quadrant, Natures Night, 17th of June, 2771      Tonis head swiveled about, trying to glean some clue as to his location.He tried to shout, only to have the sound smothered by the cloth in his mouth.It tasted of sweat, and Toni knew it was part of the undershirt Ian had given Kaiser to protect him from the sun.His prisoner was on the warpath and his camp was unprotected.He thought of the possibilities, and they terrified him.The stranger reminded him that it was all his fault.He should not have turned his back on the earthling.He should have remembered the dagger.He should have remembered the pistol as well.Each realization was like a punch to the stomach.But when he thought on it a little harder, he realized that his first mistake was having spared Kaisers life on that day at the plantations.He forced himself to calm down and think of a way out of the mess.He decided to test his bindings and gave them a good yank, only to feel his right arms wounds tear open and begin to bleed.He cried into the cloth in his mouth and then tried to spit it out.The effort proved impossible; a strip of cloth wrapped around his head was holding it in place.He then tried to stand.The tree he was bound to was a thick pine, but the wide strap that confined his arms afforded him enough space for the necessary acrobatics.Finding a knobby outcrop about a foot above the ground, he put his boot on it and threw himself up and forwards, tucking his body into a tight roll.His boots scraped against the trunk, sending bark everywhere and slowing him down a little too much.He fell hard on his head, only his right leg managing to get clear, his bound arms still hugging the other leg as well as the tree itself.The jolt of the collision sent shockwaves throughout his body and he felt his wounds tear open a little more.He screamed with the pain again, almost choking on the cloth as he tried to suck air in.Finding himself in a very awkward position, Tonis heel found the knob and he jumped again, his left leg finally managing to clear the tree as he fell onto his side, still hugging the cursed pine.With enormous difficulty he stood again, his twisted body set in an upside down hug.He leaned against the trunk and tried to grab his own wrists, working blindly.Finally he gave up, realizing that they were still too far apart, and tried to kick at the bindings of his left wrist instead.They were too firm to slip off; he had been bound with his own rifle strap.I suppose thats what Kaiser would call poetic justice, heh?the stranger sniggered.Cart wheeling over his head and on to his other side, he kicked at the bindings on his other wrist.They were slick with blood and gave a little.Desperately he pressed his boots edge against the bulge of the strap, ignoring the pain shooting up his arm, and felt it slowly begin to recede.The knot slipped off his swollen wrist with a particularly vicious kick.Without delay, Toni lay on his back and pulled the pistol out of his pocket, loving the feel of steel against his palm.He chambered a round, pointed the weapon to the sky and fired off three shots, praying that he was not too late.He rose unsteadily to his feet and began to search the ground around the tree for drag marks.They proved to be easy to find.Moving as fast as he could, Toni followed the trail back to the camp and arrived there in under a minute.His comrades were already awake, hands gripping rifles in expectation of a fight, and they stared at their arriving comrade as if in shock.Ian appeared particularly surprised to see him.Hes gone ...was about all Toni could say.We know ...Hannah replied, her expression grim, and she pointed to the only prone figure among them.Ray had been sleeping on his back when Kaiser found him.He still lay that way.The only change was the gaping wound that had almost separated his head from his body.The body lay in a pool of blood.The damage seemed almost impossibly great and Toni approached the corpse in horrified fascination, taking note of the almost peaceful expression on its face.The cut had been clean, and it appeared to have begun well on the right side of his throat and ended well to the left, having only been stopped by bone.His dagger had done all that.He noticed the depressions in the ground where Kaisers knees had made an indent as he sat astride his victim, preventing him from making a sound.So this is how a professional kills, he thought numbly.He turned to Ian and pointed the pistol at his right shoulder.The weapon kicked satisfyingly in his hand with a sharp crack, the projectile striking its target perhaps a little more to his left than he would have preferred.Ians face became even more surprised, and the Lacrau that he had been holding moments before slipped from his hands to hang from its strap.Sueli fell to the ground and began to cry again.What are you doing, Toni?Hannah demanded.Keep your eyes out for Kaiser ...I said, what the hell are you doing, Toni?!she shouted as Ians disbelieving eyes followed the blood flowing from his wound to its source.KEEP YOUR FUCKING EYES OUT FOR KAISER!Toni roared.Just as quickly he calmed down again and turned towards Ian.You are under arrest for aiding and abetting in the escape of a prisoner of war.I do believe that falls under treason, am I right?You shot me ...I did nothing to you  Ian sputtered incredulously.You did everything to deserve this.And if you open your mouth again, theyll have to wire it back together.It was your watch, your watch, not mine   Toni approached Ian at speed.His senior didnt even bother to evade the assault as Tonis boot crashed against his jaw.The bone didnt quite shatter, although the impact did produce a satisfying thunk.Ian collapsed to the ground and lay there, cradling his wound.He disarmed the fallen soldier and removed the rifle strap from his weapon before binding his wrists with it.Toni, would you care to explain this?Hannah insisted, her rifle fixed on the surrounding trees.Toni recounted what he had seen during Ians watch; of how their senior had had an opportunity to only appear to properly bind their prisoner, and how, when Toni had taken Kaiser to relieve himself, he had been distracted by a sound much like a rock thrown into the trees.He also explained how Kaiser had not been in possession of Ians MEWAC undershirt at the time.And yet that very same shirt had been used to gag and hood him.And you think that will hold up in a court?!Hes a Templeton, you IDIOT!she exploded at last.You know theres no way Kaiser could have escaped without somebody helping him, not the way we were doing things, he insisted.Youre bleeding again ...she muttered, looking him up and down.Cant you do anything without bleeding?A very upset Sueli kept watch while Hannah treated Ians and Tonis wounds.The effort ended up taking much more time than expected, and before long the first tentative chirps of dawn could be heard.Ian made a difficult situation easy by shutting up for good.Simplifying things even more, Sueli renounced her claim to the throne about as soon as seniority came under discussion.Thus Toni found himself the acting senior of the group, or at least what remained of it.Finally they broke camp, leaving Rays body where it lay.The smell of smoke caught Tonis attention, and he led the group to higher ground to contemplate what he supposed was Kaisers parting gift.A string of forest fires extended out to their south east, the nearest no more than a few kilometers away.The Winds will make that spread for days ...Hannah breathed, appalled by the destruction.What worries me is that the fires are pointing out our axis of retreat, Toni said, once again reminding himself that he was responsible for the mess.How do you think he set them?she wondered.Did you see Rays travel pack?He must have taken it before he left, along with the box of matches from his survival pouch.And his rifle.And his pistol.Damn.Maybe we should go ...Sueli suggested apprehensively.They set off again in a hurry, eager to get as much distance between themselves and the fires.They were fortunate in that the rising winds were blowing north west north, so there was little risk of losing a race against the inferno.Surprisingly, however, they found the wilderness surrounding them begin to teem with escaping wildlife, mostly several species of deer, but also wild boar and even a harassed looking pair of foxes.The sight of the fugitive creatures pulled at the heart strings of the femmes, but Toni surprised himself by seeing only Meat On The Run, and his trigger finger began to itch for the chance to take one down.He may have never thought of himself as a hunter before, but he had never found himself starving in the woods before either.It was about mid day when Toni saw a solitary boar trotting anxiously by about sixty paces to their right.It wasnt much to look at, but he decided it would do well enough.Setting his Lacrau to semi auto, he aimed at the beasts shoulder blade and fired off a shot.The result was almost comical; the creature leapt into the air almost as high as its own shoulder and took off at full steam as soon as it landed, shrieking as it went.It zigged and then zagged, and then disappeared into the forest.Sueli gave Toni a dirty look, and then looked pointedly elsewhere; Hannah began to laugh, and she kept laughing until a quarter hour afterwards, when they happened upon its carcass.Fear of pursuit quickly gave way to hunger, and before long they were trying to figure out how to gut a particularly hairy pig.Finally they gave up trying and hacked off its hind quarters instead, surrendering the remainder of the feast to nature.Toni estimated that each leg still carried more than five kilos of meat on them, and felt that the effort had been a worthwhile.One was stowed away in Tonis pack, the space there having become ample due to their dwindling rations.The other they placed over a campfire, where they spent the better part of an hour roasting and slicing their way to a distended belly.By the time they resumed their march, Toni found himself looking over his shoulder at the darkening sky to the south east.The winds were picking up by then, and it seemed that the blaze had finally established itself in the land.With no feeble earthling to slow them down, the group began to make good time over the course of the remaining afternoon.The air stank of smoke and Toni realized that the winds had changed again, an event not too uncommon for that time of the month, although by the twentieth they could expect it to radiate from the Thaus pupil and become very, very strong.Natures Dusk came earlier than expected, and Toni suspected that the smoke had something to do with that.They pushed onwards nevertheless, a mute Ian almost leading the way in haste.Toni knew what he was thinking, but in the meantime he simply enjoyed the fact that he didnt have to constantly prod his prisoner into movement.They finally pitched camp at the military crest of a steep hill, not so much because of hunger or lack of sleep, but mostly because their legs had begun to fail beneath them.As the femmes set about foraging for firewood and Ian sat on his rump with a defeated expression, Toni collected the Mark 4 comm boxes and began to mess around with the pendant cables male female interconnections.He ended up connecting two cables in a line, with the third and fourth spreading out from its end to make a capital T.   You think thats wise?Hannah asked as they returned with armfuls of rotting wood.It wont be a good idea to transmit, but at least we can try to passively scan frequencies, cant we?he proposed.He tried to climb a tall pine and quickly realized that the task would require two working arms, and so he gave up instead and sat opposite Ian.They tried very hard not to stare at each other as they awaited the femmes return.My, how in hell have men survived so long?Hannah quipped as they returned with another load.She turned to Sueli with a cocky grin.Look at them!Faces busted up, arms slung, unable to climb an itsy tree, theyre practically an endangered species ...Toni tried not to smile.It hurt his ego too much.Before long, camp was set and a fire sizzled, what remained of a boars leg roasting from a spit.Hannah climbed the tree and stretched out the antenna, leaving him to try to figure out the communicators functions.Before long Toni could hear the steady crackle of static over the comm, and he set the mode to frequency scan, carefully keeping his fingers clear of the PTT.It did not take long for the scanner to pick something up.A simple non repetitive clicking code was being transmitted from somewhere to their north east.What, you improvised a Geiger counter?Sueli asked, in high spirits due to the impending meal.Nope.I think its a signal from Lograin.he replied with a frown, catching everyones attention.Press decode ...Hannah suggested after a moment of silence.He fixed the frequency and pressed the decode button.Surely enough, after a few moments of listening, the devices display presented him with the decoded message.SOURCE: LOGRAIN AIR BASE (UNCOMPROMISED)  DISTANCE: 685.7 KM  MESSAGE: ALL WILD ROSE SURVIVORS MUST REMAIN PASSIVE ON COMMS UNTIL 500 KM FROM BASE.NO EVACUATION WILL BE ATTEMPTED BEYOND 500 KM RADIUS OF BASE.UNMIL FORCES STILL ACTIVE BEYOND ORIGINAL CONTACT LOCATION.How can they be so sure about their distance to us?Hannah asked, apparently not too happy with the number.Toni smiled.All radios and transmission towers have synchronized atomic clocks.These emergency signals are sent at precise times, so the receivers only need to measure the delay in signal reception to calculate their distance to them.Directions another matter, though.Our antenna is non directional, which is another way of saying were 685 clicks away from Lograin without a clue as to azimuth.Well just have to keep following the trail ...she muttered.Follow the trail for the next two hundred clicks?!Sueli cried.Thats more than four days march, and the Winds will have hit us by then.No one sends rescue missions against the Winds!She began to weep again.Then well have to find shelter for as long as they last, he suggested, disliking the defeated tone of her voice.Weve already proven we can hunt, but what we really need to do is find shelter that can stand up to the Rains.It might be a good idea to leave the valley up ahead and climb the Dogspine range.Im sure we could find a cave or something along those lines.How far up ahead is it?she asked hopefully.A hundred clicks or so.Enough to get there in two days and settle down for the wait.Alright, we will do that if we must ...Hannah agreed.Toni tested Ians bindings before going to asleep, noticing with satisfaction how the winds rustling the treetops had cleared away the smoke.They did not set a watch for the night.Toni was roughly shaken awake in the morning, finding an alarmed Hannah urging him to rise.He felt strangely heavy and had difficulty making out the camp, and he finally realized that it was almost completely obscured by smoke.He picked up a crackling sound uphill, and his eyes widened in alarm as he saw an enormous tongue of flame reach towards the sky.Youre kidding me!he exclaimed.I wish!We have seconds to scoot!she shouted as she began to stow her sleeping bag.Feeling drunk with sleep, or with carbon monoxide poisoning, now that he thought about it, he quickly gathered his things and removed Ians bindings, and before long they were making a running descent of the hill.By the time they had reached its base, the entire heights were ablaze, and a strong wind was pushing the inferno further towards them.Then he remembered that hed left the pendant cables hanging in the tree.Oh, no ...he exclaimed, hating himself over yet another blunder.What?Never mind ...They kept up the running pace and slowly managed to outrun the wildfire, moving over the MEWAC trail since it was relatively clear of obstacles.Toni wondered for how long they would have to flee, knowing that it was only a matter of time until they exhausted themselves.We march and we run ...he decided.The group spent the following two hours marching and running in equal intervals, trying to keep up a respectable pace until they finally began to feel a steady north easterly again.Only then did they rest.Weve lost the cables, he finally admitted.I know, she replied, not caring to discuss the matter further.There really wasnt much else to say and so, after the pause for rest, they set off again.After a while they realized that the forest was ominously silent, as if dawn had not yet arrived.It hasnt ...they concluded after a short discussion.Toni felt cheated of his sleep.There were, however, only two things that could be done about the matter.After a short debate the group opted for the more unpleasant choice, and they each swallowed a pill from the meager remainder of their combat kits, each capsule containing enough delayed release Ampakines and caffeine to keep them going for twenty hours.Beyond that boundary, only a double dose would be able to keep them from falling into a deep, exhausted sleep.Toni didnt want to think about what would happen to him after a double dose of combat pills effects had worn off.As the group set off yet again to follow Main Forces trail, he quietly decided it wasnt worth the risk to find out.As they progressed along their north westerly course, Toni made an effort to tune out his surroundings and focus on an imminent problem.MEWAC had timed their operations to take the greatest possible advantage of the twelve day window of good weather, but as Capicuas orbit took the planet out into deeper space, the humidity that was slowly building up would eventually condense into rainclouds.Before that, however, the winds would pick up as the hot air from its solar pole began to trade places with the more temperate and humid air from the sea that surrounded Thaumantias.A powerful and continuous wind would eventually sweep the landscape and test every trees will to stand.Few animals would dare to be out in the open when such winds were raging.But once the humid coastal air had made it in deep enough, and as the planet swung out at its furthest distance to the red sun, the winds would die down and the downpour would begin, as the saturated atmosphere cooled down enough for the trapped moisture within to be finally released.To sum things up neatly, if the Great Winds didnt kill them, the Great Rains most certainly would.And he honestly couldnt see himself hunting during those days, which meant that no hunger he had felt before would compare to what the Cap had in store for them over the following fortnight.The group had perhaps two days of hunting at best before the brief window of opportunity snapped tightly shut.There would probably be no forest fire to herd the fauna their way, and Toni wouldnt dare set one on purpose; with the uncertain winds, they might well kill themselves in the attempt.The more he thought about it, the more desperate their situation seemed to him.Theres always Ian, if youre hungry, a dark voice suggested.He throttled the thought immediately, horrified at the mere possibility of the act.But the words echoed persistently in his mind, unasked for and unwanted.They were grimly self righteous words, spoken with the upper lip pulled back to the gums, and he deeply disliked them.But the stranger quietly did the math until, satisfied with the bottom line, it returned contentedly to its slumber.Over the following hours natures dawn arrived, and the survivors of LOGIS settled down to roast that remained of the boars hindquarter.No one spoke, none willing to bring up the fact that they had only a days worth of rations left.The hindquarter was scraped to the bone for every sliver of flesh, and Toni couldnt help but wonder at how Ian would look once all the meat had been carved away from him.He shivered, and tried hard not to look at his prisoner.The day stretched out and so did the kilometers, the cadets eating up the distance as if it was their final meal.There was no pause for lunch, and by the time the local fauna had settled in and the group collapsed into an exhausted pile of limbs, more than seventy kilometers had been traversed since their awakening.The following morning, Toni awoke to find that they would not be repeating the previous days performance.His legs werent merely stiff anymore; there was a pain in his joints that recent experience had taught him was a prelude to injury.There was no Ultarine in their combat kit to accelerate muscle and ligament regeneration.It was tagged as good for training but bad for combat, its side effects prone to dehydrate a fighting soldier to the point of incapacitating him.And it also became clear to him that he wasnt alone.Hannah wasnt smiling anymore and Sueli wasnt bitching anymore, and Ian kept his head between his legs as he sat, speaking to no one.They skipped breakfast and set off, moving dispiritedly along a trail that was no longer so easy to follow.The terrain was becoming difficult as they approached the foothills that preceded the Dogspine, the topsoil there almost non existent, the spacing between trees and shrubs wide enough in Wild Roses initial passage for little vegetation to have been disturbed.Toni sullenly realized that, with the present trail so tenuous that only Suits footpads on the ground were still visible, then after the rains it would be nearly impossible to find.After a meager lunch, the cadets decided to rest their feet for a while.They soon began to dose off, and before they knew it natures dusk arrived.Sitting in a circle as stillness fell upon the forest, the sergeant cadets observed each other tiredly, not deigning to say a word.Toni finally took out a combat pill and swallowed it, the remainder doing the same except for Ian, who required assistance from Sueli.They set off into natures night, the sun shining as brightly as ever but the fauna hiding from it.Toni was on point again, wondering whether it would be easier to hunt during natures night, when the critters were all sleeping in their holes.To his surprise, he began to hear birds chirping again.Quickly he put a knee to the ground and took shelter behind a tree, the remaining cadets hastily following suit.It was far too early for dawn, and Toni had since learned that when birds sang in the night, it was because something had upset them.He was certain his group had been moving too quietly to be the culprits, and so he peered cautiously into the forest ahead, using the broad tree to shield his body as he sought the source of the disturbance.All was strangely quiet again.Toni looked to his rear, where a puzzled Hannah was raising an eyebrow at him.He frowned, uncertain of what to do.After several minutes without noise or contacts Toni began to question himself.Finally he stood, disgusted with himself for being so skittish, and began to advance cautiously over the uneven terrain, the remnants of his platoon following behind at a distance.He began to hear chirping again, and he paced the distance slowly with his Lacrau held out before him, wondering whether the local fauna had taken offense at their presence.The chirping slowly intensified as a reddening Toni advanced, until finally he lost his temper.SHUT THE FUCK UP!he roared into the wilderness.He was answered immediately.ATTENTION INDRUDER.IDENTIFY YOURSELF OR YOU WILL BE FIRED UPON.Toni hurled himself into a bush and smothered his body against the ground, the noise to his right and rear making it clear that his mates had copied him.His heart pounded heavily in his chest as seconds passed by.ATTENTION INTRUDER.IDENTIFY YOURSELF OR YOU WILL BE FIRED UPON.Identify yourself first!Toni shouted.O KYAKUSAMA, GO CHUUI KUDASAI.SAKKYUU NI NANORIDETE KUDASAI.NANORIDENAI BAAI HA HAPPOU SAREMASU.He recognized the Japanese, and realized it had been worded far too politely to have been spoken by any living soldier.His mind raced, thinking of the possibilities.Deciding to gamble, the cadet set his weapon on safety, walked out of the half smothered bush and loudly answered the challenge.I am Sergeant cadet Toni Miura from 2nd section, LOGIS platoon, MEWAC.Please identify yourself.He stood out in the open with hands in plain view and Lacrau hanging from his tactical vest, ignoring the urgent whispers from his mates as he half expected to be gunned down.Finally a cheerful human voice answered him.Boy, you look like youve had an evil week.This is Captain Venter of the third Bot Company, second Battalion, ROWAC.How many have you got with you?the cheerful voice inquired.Three and one prisoner.Youve got to be joking.You got one of them?Toni paused for a moment, thinking of the one that got away.No sir.Hes one of ours.There was a brief pause.Ahuh, the captain finally said.We were beginning to lose hope over any more survivors, but still we had our bots keep from shooting without orders.I am very glad of that.If you were to have arrived tomorrow, the second you reached friendly lines you would have gotten a whole bunch of eight millimeter surprises.Ignoring the momentary flutter in his gut, Toni asked the question that was foremost on his mind.Sir, did LOGIS make it through?Another pause.Bits and pieces, I guess.Wed better talk about that when youre safely in the rear.You see, were expecting some company over the coming hours.Of the Unmil kind, if you get my drift.You and your mates need to move towards my voice.When you see a tin can with eyes and a rifle, youve reached the frontline.Dont make me wait, now!SEVENTEEN      Front line, Natures Night, 20th of June, 2771      As the last remnants of LOGIS broke through the foliage to scrutinize the source of the cheerful voice, it quickly became clear to Toni how lucky they had been.Interspaced five meters from one another, the combat drones rested in semi prepared positions along a front that stretched out beyond sight.Humanoid in general appearance, especially the light weight ones armed with modified Lacraus, they nevertheless lay unnaturally still in their incomplete foxholes.Further back he could spy the heavier firepower, an anti armor team to his left and a less deftly concealed machinegun position above and to his right, all manned by heavy combat drones.The heavy bots were of more robust constitution, although their greater carrying strength was counterbalanced by slightly reduced autonomy.Toni had read the right magazines to know that much about the killing components of the Robotic Warfare Corps, but the SICs formal training regimen hadnt yet progressed to the point of discussing the finer points of their sister military unit.It was also clear that the line was positioned in a zigzag pattern along the terrain, their group having crossed the frontline at the nook where a zig began to zag.If you close your mouths and advance twenty paces, Id really appreciate it, guys, the cheerful voice piped.Toni peered up into the trees, aware that the low static sound emanating from the bots nearby had intensified the moment the voice had spoken.The group set off again and ascended the rise from where the voice had come from, coming upon a local droid commander surrounded by its protective detail.It turned its inhuman oculars towards them and spoke.Greetings, pilgrims.Youre still a good distance from where I am so, if you turn left and scoot south west about fifty meters, youll come upon another section leader and his command section.Good luck, the bot spoke cheerily as the surrounding bots hissed aloud.It then returned its attention to the lines as if the ghost possessing it had suddenly abandoned its frame.Thank you ...Toni declared uncertainly, unnerved by the fact that the bots had also hissed at his words, as if outraged that he would dare say such a thing.Fifty paces ahead they came upon another section commander which, at their arrival, turned towards them and cheerily pointed them once more to the north west.The group thanked the bot and trundled wearily onwards for another two hundred meters, before arriving at a small depression guarded by more heavy bots armed with light machineguns and antitank weapons.In the depressions center, the only human members of the robotic infantry company sat.Heavily camouflaged and armed with an assortment of portable electronic equipment, two men about ten years their senior peered away from their instruments and towards the newcomers.You lot look like youve been through hell, the more heavy set of the two remarked cheerfully as he approached and shook their hands, waving off their salutes as unnecessary.Good day ...said the younger of them, a reed thin lieutenant with a grim face who raised his hand up at them before returning to his duties.Once the cadets had introduced themselves and presented their credentials, the captain turned towards the only one among them whose hands were bound.Is this your prisoner?Captain Venter asked, taking Ian carefully by the arm for a closer look.Sir, I have been wrongfully arrested.My junior has a beef with   Shut it, Ian, Toni interrupted.Sergeant cadet Templeton may be the most senior of our platoon, but that still doesnt give him the right to aid in the escape of an enemy prisoner.That prisoner then slit another cadets throat before setting fire   That cadet executed a prisoner of war in cold blood!And you shot me after letting a prisoner under your direct responsibility escape, Rays death is on your h  Shut your mouth, prisoner Templeton!the Captain interrupted.He was no longer cheerful; a broad frown had spread across his wide face.He turned to Toni and gave him a hard look.I wont interfere in this matter.You gave the order of arrest, and so its you wholl have to back that decision up with evidence.I have a bigger fish to fry, and it is pesently on its way here.A big fish ...It wouldnt happen to walk on two legs, would it?Hannah asked.The captain flashed her with a wicked grin and remarked with his faux American accent, You hit that nail right on the head!We expect to have enemy contact within the next two to four hours.Single walker, its heading is suspiciously similar to yours, so I expect you lot were being followed.Or maybe its just following the same thing we were, Toni suggested, the trail left by MEWAC on its way south east.Tonis remark brought a slow smile back onto the captains face.Well, if thats the case, then Id expect it to contact that line right where you did, right?Arright Lieutie, get ready to redeploy our line!I want the left flank to fall back until its staggered, and call Murata to our left and tell him to do the same with his right flank.Were gonna funnel this walker in   Wont work ...his lieutenant interrupted tiredly.The Unmil will be tipped off when it passes through the trenches our bots have already dug.I want our right flank to advance until it is staggered, call Murata to do the same with his left.Were gonna funnel this walker in  the captain corrected confidently.If you wanna call Murata, you can do it yourself.And you can call HQ to get authorization while youre at it, the lieutenant interrupted again before calmly holding a corded telephone out to his commander.Venter sniffed at the snub but didnt seem too upset.He approached his lieutenant, snatched the phone from his outstretched hand, squatted on the dirt and began to speak into it.From the telephone receiver a black wire stretched, snaking its way into what appeared to be a compact switching station.From that station many more wires snaked, two of them extending in opposite directions parallel to the front lines while more stretched out rearwards into the forest.The captain spoke cheerfully into the receiver as the cadets sat on the hard ground, nursing their foot blisters.The conversation continued for a while, the speakers on the other side apparently reluctant to authorize what was sounded like a risky plan.Before long, however, it became clear from the lieutenants exasperated expression that the captain was going to get his way.The captain finally handed the phone back to his subordinate with smug satisfaction.As I was saying, Leslie, you are to stagger our right flank forward so as to make the right side of a funnel, while Murata does the same with his left, and then we will move our praetorians to plug up that funnels base.It will be caught like a rat in a trap   Sir ...Toni spoke out, Im not sure thats going to work.The captain peered towards the cadet, momentarily peeved.Say your piece, he finally said.I confronted one of those Suits directly, sir.It took direct hits from twenty five mil, thirty mil, four SABERO rockets and the hammerheads Bloodhound IIs.Nothing stopped it.The Unmil killed a member of my section, took out my Suit, and killed a large number of Hammerheads without a sweat, and the only thing that stopped it was a nuke detonated by its own forces   Sergeant cadet Miura, do you think that Im stupid?the captain asked.N no, sir.We have already been briefed regarding the enemy Suits capabilities.Several days ago, in fact.We are here for one reason and one reason only.That lone Suit is advancing straight towards Lograin Air Base, and thats just where everyone happens to be boxed in.As you boys were advancing to the south east, ROWAC and the light infantry battalions were touching down in Lograin along with enough unattached heavy armor to found a new corps.By the time we all got there, most of you MEWAC boys were already beating a hasty retreat back to base.It is now overpopulated and understaffed, and then they tell us its time to retreat so we can reorganize our forces, get our factories up to full gear and come up with a winning plan.Only there arent nearly enough aircraft for the tonnage that we need to shift.ROWACs presence here has only one objective, and that is to delay the Suits advance until the base has been evacuated.And were doing that because we are supremely aware of its capabilities.If we were to give it less than our very best, it would simply swat us aside and keep on advancing, and Lograin just cant afford that, can it?No sir.I just   Ive organized an evacuation for you but its going to take a while.The rovers have been tasked with actions other than evac, and so I expect theyll only be free to get you out once theyve fulfilled their other obligations.In the meantime you stick with us, understood?Yes sir, they all replied quietly.Before long, the group was once more on the move, although the journey proved to be a short one.The command section, their compliment of praetorians and the ragged cadets moved eastwards for half a kilometer, where they reformed at the base of 3rd companys left flank.There was hardly any need to dig in, their new position being located precisely where Toni and his crew had come upon the frontline less than an hour before.As the captain personally marked where he expected the praetorians to establish their positions, Toni cautiously approached the lieutenant.Sir.May I ask why youre so worried about this?Is it really such a bad plan?The lieutenant sighed in annoyance.He gave Toni a measuring look, and then he shrugged and answered his question.No.The plan isnt bad.Except for the fact that the captain always insists on being where the action is.And that means being where his praetorian guards are.He intends to try and funnel an enemy Suit right against our companys most heavily armed and armored elements.The problem is that, if it works, that means hell be directing the enemy onto his own position!And if the praetorians dont stop the Suit, chances are good well be fried once it punches through the line.We can fight, sir.The lieutenant sighed once more.Fightings for bots, cadet.Im not so sure mankind has any place left on a battlefield.Im more certain now after what happened to your outfit.Sir, the enemys got men driving their Suits.I know that for a fact   You dont have their Suits!You dont even have your own Suits!All youve got is that rifle and a few grenades.So whats going to happen is   Leslie, where the fuck is Murata?The lieutenant sighed yet again and turned his attention to the captain.Sir, my name is Lieutenant Stevenson.And Captain Murata isnt going to be with his praetorians.His bots are already emplaced where you wanted them, but the captains going to find a safer spot for his command and equipment.Pussy ...the captain remarked with a twisted smile.Toni couldnt help but smile at the captain.The captains wasted in ROWAC.He should have been light infantry, he remarked in an undertone.He was a footman before he went to Officers School, the lieutenant replied, as if agreeing that all footmen were insane.The praetorians began to hiss again.When Toni remarked about it, the lieutenant explained.It may sound like a hiss to your ears but thats actually one of the ways the bots communicate.Theyre equipped to communicate by long wave radio, short wave radio, luminous signals, hand codes and audio comms.Since we didnt want any comms intercepted or jammed, and since the bots were mostly out of each others sight due to terrain, the only remaining solution was audio comms.They were even communicating when you boys were closing in on them.You heard them as birds chirping, but there was a cipher hidden in the sound.The Suit probably wont know were out there until the festivities begin.The way the captains organized things, the better part of two companies will have an opportunity to engage the Unmil in the first moments of battle.And it wont be able to block the comms like it did with your drivers.Sorry, sir, but I dont think that will be enough.Seventeen anti armor teams per company.Two companies.Four RPGs per two bot team.Thats a hundred and thirty six RPGs, each with an explosive warhead weighing over twelve kilo mass.Such an assault could take out most of the ASC under ideal conditions.Either way you boys shouldnt be here by then.Just keep to our rear, jump on the rovers once they get here and dont look back.The lieutenant returned to his duties, leaving Toni to ponder on the matter.Theyre going to die in that foxhole, the stranger declared nonchalantly, youve got your own battle ahead of you, and you have precious few weapons with which to fight it.Toni knew what he was talking about.The captains words had finally begun to sink in regarding the need to defend his order of arrest, and he realized that all he had at the moment was his word against Ians.The thought of what he was going to have to deal with in the future made him want to jump into the trenches to fight alongside the bots.They at least werent prone to bush whacking or betrayal.A sudden hissing along the line, however, made him wonder about that.Unknown contact audible in the forest, Lieutenant Stevenson whispered as they huddled around the equipment.Heading is what we expected, its following the MEWAC trail.Is it in the funnel yet?the captain asked.He was staring thoughtfully towards the south east.Its in, but just barely, the lieutenant answered.We wait ...the captain decided.A full minute passed before the captain asked again.His lieutenant answered softly.Its in but not yet midway.The Unmil is either being careful, or it suspects something.Tell Murata to begin to carefully close the end of his side of the funnel.Do the same with ours.Thirty seconds later the lieutenant began to tense up.Sir, the Unmil has halted.Im stopping my bots.Another minute passed and only the hissing could be heard.It seemed so loud to Tonis ears that he wondered if it was the noise that was giving them away.Unmil is on the move again.Moving slowly.Heading straight towards us.Sir, its half a click away and closing.Do we assault now?Are you mad?the captain retorted irritably.We want her to come here, where weve concentrated our RPGs.Let her come.Keep closing the other end of the funnel.Box her in.Another minute passed by and the lieutenant gestured silently to the cadets to get ready to move at any moment.Turning to his captain, the lieutenant whispered.Youre going to get what you want.The Unmil is less than two hundred meters away and closing.The funnel is closed and the contact is boxed in.There are confirmed visuals by emplaced anti armor teams.Now, sir?After a moments pause the captain looked rearwards.There was no longer a smile on his face, only that broad frown.Tensely he gave the signal for the cadets to retreat before returning his gaze to the south east.Engage the fucker, he ordered.The cadets did not retreat but watched silently instead, spellbound by the tension of the moment.A silent order passed from the lieutenant to his bots in a hissing wave, and then the forest suddenly became alive with screeching missiles.Deafening concussions rocked the woods, waking it violently from its slumber as belching fumes began to ascend the sky.The detonations were immediately followed by the roar of machineguns, increasing in number and intensity until all Toni could hear was a screaming, popping static.The static began to be punctuated by ever more frequent detonations as the sounds of battle began to reach their peak.What exactly are we still doing here?Hannah shouted into his ears.He thought about that for a moment, and it became clear to him that they urgently needed to be someplace else.There was no need to reply.Hannah grabbed Ian and Toni grabbed Sueli, and the remnants of LOGIS set of at a run to their north east, again following what remained of MEWACs signs of passage.Toni risked a glance behind and saw the vegetation before Venters position being struck by a laser pulse, its defenders hastily exiting their foxhole as smoke and fire nearly overwhelmed them.More concussions rocked the forest, their shock waves knocking flat anything not attached to the ground, and Toni suddenly found himself lying there, the deafening static sound of gunfire still screaming into his ears.The enemy Suit came within sight, and it sauntered over the forest floor with kneepads well bent and frame in reduced silhouette, its armor sparking and glinting as myriad small caliber projectiles struck their target.The Suits oculars laser glimmered, its beam cutting up the landscape like a luminous scalpel.Its helm turned towards him and that laser flashed once more, the ground shooting up dirt wherever the beam touched, bark and limb and tree bursting into flames and subsiding to the earth.The kicked up dust enshrouded him, cloaking his surroundings from the titans killing sight, and the screaming static in his ears was overruled by a keening, screeching sound that tore into his heart.Twisting around where he lay, his eyes fell upon Sueli, who rolled over the ground hugging what appeared to be a child by its leg.Clumsily he stood and approached and tried to pry the child from her arms before she could smother it, his mind at odds with what he was seeing, wondering how a civilian could have found its way into the midst of a battlefield.Sueli held on desperately, as if it was her own offspring she held, and once he had managed to pull one of her arms away, he realized how wrongly he had judged what he was seeing.It was not a child.It was her own leg she was holding, the members boot having somehow been lost, her petite foot jutting out from her embracing arms for the world to see.He stared in horror at the vision, and then his eyes searched downwards until they found the cleanly cauterized stump well above her right knee.Looking behind, he found the sounds of battle receding as bots coursed the terrain in pursuit of their prey, oblivious to the fact that they would also soon be in pieces.Toni scooped her up, caring not in the least for his injured right arm, and stifled his emotions as he set eyes upon her face.Her face was perfect except for the horror that was stamped there.She cried and shrieked, and there was something animal about the way she blinked at her surroundings.He ran as he held her firmly, coming upon Hannah further down the trail where she had been wrestling with Ian on the ground.He said nothing to her or to Ian, the weeping soldier in his arms putting an end to the fight more effectively than any word could have.They stared at Sueli as she embraced her leg.Blinking back tears, Hannah took out a hypodermic painkiller and injected the drug into her comrade, and the group then set off at a jog down the trail, where the revving of engines had became audible.Four rovers coursed over the terrain at speed, jumping and careening along almost as if they were out of control.They rolled to a stop before them and ROWACs Command and Services section assessed the state of the group.Oh lord ...was all one of them could say.Moments later, Toni was shoved into the confined flatbed of the rover with a warning to hold on tight, a semi conscious Sueli still firmly held in his arms.He numbly realized that that was the first time he was holding a woman in his arms.Pity, the demon inside jested, pity that shes in pieces and would sell you downriver in a heartbeat for her leg back.Toni didnt care if she did, nor would he blame her, for that matter.He rested his head on her chest, feeling the fever quick beat of her heart against his cheek as he fell off into a deep sleep, heedless of the bouncing rover or the suffering woman, and heedless also of the fact that Ian was for the first time alone, separated from his teammates on a vehicle that was no longer in sight.*****      KAISER!Lippard roared over the loudspeaker, armored footpads pounding over the forest floor as she momentarily ignored her scurrying foes.It was a useless exercise, the deafening noise produced by the surrounding suicidal infantry drowning out her calls.The question of whether the locals had any fight in them had been answered in capital letters.Her oculars had already been damaged several times, and she suspected that snipers were deliberately aiming for them.The stock of oculars that were stored in her helm was down to two thirds capacity after less than a minute of battle, with no end in sight to the engagement.Nothing enraged her more than the sort of tactics she was witnessing at the moment.Whether one called it a human wave attack or a banzai attack, what she saw before her was an almost alien, inhuman commitment to resistance.That fact alone was enough to make her blood boil, but the rage was compounded by the fact that Kaiser had been taken prisoner by the heathens.How could he?!How could he allow himself to be captured?Deadhand was dead, a gigantic loss for their team.Kaisers Suit was beyond repair, which was perhaps an even greater setback.But if Kaiser were somehow forced to speak, the consequences would be disastrous.They hadnt as yet established themselves at the mines in any way that would allow them to counteract their lack of manpower.And yet the Ebony Tower, hermetically sealed and sanitized in its methods of thinking as it was, had decided to forbid any rescue operations.All of which meant absolutely nothing to her.The mobile Suit she currently possessed was thermonuclear powered, her lasers feeding on the very same power source, and only food supply limited her autonomy in any appreciable way.Several rockets suddenly impacted against her frame, the detonations sending her into the dirt below.The performance sphere cocooned her securely, considerably reducing the force of impact.It was, however, entirely inadequate to shield her pride, and it was there that the fall most injured her.Das ist es!JEDER STIRBT!!she roared, her hoarse voice breaking with the effort.Planting her footpads securely on the ground, she lowered her center of mass and gave her system the appropriate orders.All movements in her field of vision suddenly sprouted bright red reticules, and another larger reticule appeared directly in the center of her field of vision.Turning her head, she centered the large cross over the many smaller crosses, the Suits OS making the appropriate calculations before activating the co axial laser.That laser, sharing the space inside her helm along with the oculars and ocular replacement equips, had only one purpose: antipersonnel.It cut through the landscape and bodies fell, and Lippard began for the first time to wonder whether her attackers were human at all.Where was the screaming that usually accompanied its use, where were the bodies cut in pieces, and why were so many exploding into flames?It wasnt their ammunition that was doing that, although she could hear them popping off as the flames enveloped their burning bodies.Some continued to fight as they burned, and she watched, horrified, wondering whether they were under the influence of narcotics.One more flash and, somehow, through all the shots and explosions, Lippard began to hear a wailing, screeching sound, shortly followed by someone shouting.The sounds were music to her ears, and she grinned viciously as she turned her armor towards her enemies left flank.The screams slowly became less pronounced as she moved along the trenches and foxholes, cutting and burning her way through the vegetation and all who hid there until she could no longer hear anything at all.Before long, Lippard was moving in silence except for the impact of projectiles against her frame, the occasional explosion, and the tearing sounds produced by her laser beams against their targets.One particular target died hard, hit below by her pulse rifle and then seared by her co axial laser, but it kept on firing as it burned, making no sound.She halted her advance and pulled the warriors rifle from its hands before picking it up for inspection.Inside her performance sphere, Lippards eyes hardened as she turned it over in her hand, suddenly aware that no amount of force from her gauntlets would be enough to kill it.The vessel in her hands had never known life.It stared at her as it burned before beginning to chirp beautifully, as if encased somewhere within its metallic body a talented songbird sang.Lifting the obscene creature over her helm, she launched it out into the wilderness, a champions throw that would keep it airborne for a few moments at least, flying and singing as it left a charcoal smear across the windy sky.KAISER!GET ME OUT OF THIS NIGHTMARE!she screamed, the loudspeaker of her Suit failing to amplify her words to the volume she felt they deserved.The forest around her smoked and burned, the rising pillars slanting to the north west as the strengthening wind pushed them away.The scurrying figures continued to fire at her, their obsolete projectiles impacting against her armor to make obsolete sounds.Then the figures began to retreat towards the mountains.Lippard hesitated for a moment, wondering what to do.Then she began to follow them, lost and uncertain, but aware that among those tin cans some humans could be found.The screaming from before made her certain of that.She would find one of them and squeeze his body as she asked a few questions.Crushing pain was about the worst pain that one could feel, and she had learned by acquired experience that even the toughest combatant could sing like a canary if enough pressure was applied.She relished the thought, shivering and smiling as her footpads began to pound the earth again.EIGHTEEN     Base Fido, Natures Dawn, 20th of June, 2771      Colonel Toramaki Sen observed the display panel and grimaced.His expression was carefully studied and imitated by his subordinates, who surrounded the wide table into which the panel was embedded.Looking briefly south west through the campaign tents mosquito netted window, the colonel thought about the difficult decisions that lay before him.Grimacing again, he leaned towards his comms officer.The companies currently under attack are to cease offensive action and retreat.This retreat must be slow and organized, and they must head northwards into the Dogspine.Waste this monsters time!Get it lost in the ranges folds and crevices, because the time weve made it lose up until now doesnt yet justify the losses weve just suffered.As for the companies it passes by, once its in the Dogspine they are to harass the bakemono every step of the way.Colonel, as for the casualties   The bot casualties are of no concern.They were out of date anyway ...I think he meant our people, sir, an old major interjected.They have perhaps two days of food left, the winds are arriving and the rains will soon follow.What about them?The colonel thought about that for a while.ROWAC was an unusual unit in that the majority of its human components were not dedicated to frontline duties.Between logistics, resupply and the three Cs, ROWAC congregated more than two hundred personnel in its command base.He had decided to locate Base Fido right in the middle of the pass that interrupted the northern and southern ranges of the Dogspine.The base was a highly improvised thing, of course, but its situation, well flanked by the mountain ranges tall peaks, and by the fast river that followed the northern slopes of the northern range, provided effective protection.The base was also situated on the axis MEWAC had forged in its passing, and his esteemed EWAC colleagues were at the moment improving the conditions of that axis from Fido to Lograin to favor a more fluid ROWAC retreat, and booby traps had already begun to be set there.The base itself was concealed within the tall grove that grew in the pass, a smaller grove of nearby Diesel trees having blessed that spot as well.The Diesel grove had been spurned by MEWAC in their passing; their deposits were too meager to justify the effort of tapping for fuel to power those oil guzzling armored Suits.ROWACs energy requirements were more humble, however, and the grove had proved generous enough to fuel all his bots.The bots didnt burn the fuel, of course.Their generators had instead been designed to saturate the oil with oxygen and infuse a small amount of initial heat, the resulting slow decomposition being enough to quietly and efficiently power their systems for a couple of days.That grove had since dried up, not due to ROWAC, but to EWACs efforts instead.Contrary to common belief, MEWAC wasnt alone in operating Suits; the Engineering Warfare Corps possessed some of their own, although their adapted Hammerheads were far more lightly armed and armored, having been exclusively tasked to combat engineering, mobility and counter mobility works.It was EWAC that had dug the improvised command bunker in the midst of the more extensive pine grove.They had also dug the trenches for his elite praetorian bots, and opened up the ground surrounding the base to establish a killing field for the anti armor teams, recycling the acquired timber into the central bunker and other key positions.Progress had become slower since then, the Suits having to depend on fuel resupply from Lograin, its arrival slow and difficult due to terrain constraints.All combat was a race against time.The more fuel they had, the faster they would be able to build up the road.The faster they built up the road, the more fuel they would have, not only to continue building up the road and base fortifications, but also to dedicate their time to the setting of some very macho booby traps along the axis of retreat.Simply put, the more time they could conquer, the faster the base could become something to do some serious delaying of its own, the faster they could evacuate if things went awry, and the better their chances of dealing damage to the enemy Suit if it made the foolish mistake of using the road.The decision was all too clear for him.Our combat personnel are to persist in delaying action until the Unmil is dead, or until they are dead, or until it loses interest in them and abandons their theater.Should it leave, they are to remote detonate their bots, group into survival teams and move into the mountain range.They are to survive there in comm blackout until the sixth day of the following month.Whoever is still alive must then open comms so we can get a fix on their positions and evacuate them by air.By air?!the major blurted out angrily.Therell be no Lograin air base by that time, only drones could come in so deep, and they cannot evacuate a brown squirrel!But they can make supply drops, Dennis.If thats the only option, then it cant be helped.The alternative is that the Unmil will get here while we are still weak, smash its way through and catch Lograin with its pants down.And what makes the colonel think it wont smash its way through even when we are better fortified, a younger major asked.The colonel sighed.If we begin to make such pessimistic assumptions, we might as well decide to surrender our families to something that might not even know what mercy is.This enemy is powerful and relentless, and as a result we are being forced to make some very difficult decisions, but there is no living thing immune to death, and this one is certainly no exception.We will face it, and it will tire.And then we will kill it or we will die trying.If this command dies, it may prove impossible to resurrect ROWAC in the near future, his lieutenant colonel coldly warned.True, but if we fail to halt its progress and instead escape this theater, we wont have the window of opportunity to manufacture a house cleaning bot, never mind a force of combat drones.Well have to take the risk.Be that as it may, if it becomes clear to me that its prowess is beyond all our measures, Ill be pulling select men from battle whether you need them or not, his right arm man informed him.The colonel sighed again.Lieutenant colonel Dale Arakaki was too hard headed to warrant an argument with.The blue eyed officer possessed the almond shaped eyes of his Japanese ancestors, and they had narrowed to slits as he spoke.Like most transgens, Arakaki frowned on naturals like the colonel.Toramaki felt like explaining to his subordinate that he was still paying the debts for his three offsprings transgenetic procedures, that he had opted to ensure that his children be spared the suffering that he had endured over his youth, and that he still had to deal with every day.Colonel Toramaki had progressed within ROWAC to a position that many envied, and he had done so despite being at an enormous disadvantage in regards to his peers.It was his sharp mind that had made up for that, but he still had to deal with men like Arakaki, who failed to understand why their senior would refuse to subject himself to the same treatments as his children.Feel free to do whatever you like, Dale, in full knowledge of the fact that if I survive such an event, you would later find yourself the subject of court martial.The lieutenant colonel gave him a stiff nod, apparently unconcerned over such an eventuality.Pass the orders on, he ordered his comms officer.*****      As his subordinates reluctantly turned to their tasks, the colonel set off on his own, exiting the campaign tent towards its windy exterior.Moments later the old major quietly joined him.Of all his staff members, Dennis Haven was the one he liked the most.Which was no wonder, seeing as he was the only subordinate present by Toramakis personal request.The old grunt had never thanked him for that, but Tora had never for a moment expected him to.The men stood in the wind and observed their surroundings.The trenches were barely visible beyond the tall trees.Their canopies were being harassed by the rising winds, branches creaking and groaning noisily, striking each other occasionally to make dull wooden sounds.That thing is probably only going to stop when it wants to.You know that, right?the major said quietly.My greatest wonder is about its armor ...the colonel remarked, ignoring the question.The missiles were firing at it carry Octogen two stage shaped charges, with copper bonded tungsten powder cones.This is our state of the art, and yet even multiple hits are entirely ineffective.What are your thoughts on that?Has some kind of non explosive reactive armor ...the major mused.Something that sets the charges off prematurely or deflects the forged carrots so they wont penetrate.You should be asking someone from MEWAC or the cavalry units, though, not me.But Im asking you, Dennis ...Then my answer will be the simple one.If a small bomb doesnt do the trick, hit it with a bigger bomb!he rasped.Bigger bombs are less mobile, slower and more cumbersome.There are no warheads in existence that   Yes there are!The air force has no lack of big bombs in their inventory!But no missile that can pack that punch.The bombs are slow to fall and quick to be intercepted.The missiles are faster and have been getting through, but theyre cherry bombs compared to the free fallers.The major turned on him with a scowl.Why are you talking to me about this?You know theres a force right here with whole truckloads of explosives, a force that makes a point of improvising the charges in size and type for the mission at hand.Talk to EWAC!Theyre mine layers as well, and no mine needs to fly about to get its job done.Hell, they even have the equipment to dig as many massive holes as they need to  why are you smiling?The colonel beamed, amused at the majors angry and puzzled expression.This was why he had requested Haven for his staff officer.The grunt was just the man to bounce problems and potential solutions off of, and on occasion he even managed to come up with one of his own.The reason for that was very simple.The major was old, tired and nearing retirement, and knew he would never be promoted beyond his current rank, nor did he have any fear of speaking his mind.Of course, as long as Tora had known him, the old major had never possessed such a fear in the first place.Which was why he was still a major at the ripe old age of sixty three.A mega mine, heh?Thats your solution?the colonel asked with a smirk.What the fuck are you laughing at?!If that thing comes close enough to a giant remote detonated mine, it wont matter what magic its got up its skirt!The acceleration alone will kill the driver inside, even if the Suit doesnt have a scratch on it after.That is, assuming theres a biological entity inside, the colonel observed thoughtfully.If you dont risk it, youll never get the brandy!the major retorted.We need to find ourselves some combat engineers ...Tora decided, and the pair set off to the north east, where some could certainly be found.*****      Sergeant cadet Templeton reporting, sir, the youth declared.The filthy cadet had an injured wing.No, more like a badly injured shoulder, his arm having been confined to a sling.Nevertheless the soldier stood rigidly at attention, silently awaiting recognition by ROWACs commander after having arrived on base as one of the occupants of a single rover.Tora raised his weary head from the map he had been studying.No need to stand at attention, cadet, just take a stroll to medical bay and see to your injuries.Youll have time to do that; there wont be an evac to Lograin for the following two hours   Sir, I have an urgent matter I must first discuss with you.May I?The colonel squeezed his lips together in irritation.The tents window flaps had been lowered to prevent the sunlight from reflecting off the display panels surface, and he and a couple of captains from EWAC had been studying a map of the outlying area, discussing what to do about their uninvited guests eventual arrival.The captains were young but sharp as daggers, and they had shown to be possessed of a practical intelligence he greatly appreciated.And now this.Youll want to take quick run to medical bay, because the only way were going to talk is after those bandages are fresh and clean.Understood?The youth stood there for a long moment and the colonel began to suspect that he was about to object.Then the cadet gave his senior a stiff nod and made an abrupt about face before exiting the tent briskly.The colonel paused for a moment, wondering if there was something wrong with the boy.Pressed for time, however, he soon returned to his duties.The meeting lasted the better part of an hour, and the wind had in the meantime picked up and begun to ruffle the campaign tent as well as those inside.He was relieved when an EWAC sergeant finally informed them that the fortified bunker was complete and ready to receive ROWAC Command.The colonel had to wonder how long it would be in use, but he knew at least that those quarters would not be falling prey to the coming tempest.As the command section reached the site, Tora found the ground surrounding the bunker to still be marred by innumerous footpad prints from the Suits that had built it.The shelter was a low set construction cut into ground, bracketed by tall pines and capped with a central mound meant to provide protection against direct artillery hits.An array of camouflage nets lay over that squat artificial hill, although a moments look at its soiled surroundings made clear that they formed what was essentially a bulls eye for any drone.One of the EWAC captains quickly put his concern to rest.Theyll return shortly with more netting.Ive ordered those to be erected with spacers.I trust your men when it comes to these things, captain.Although perhaps those nets on the hill should be on spacers as well, Tora declared.The captain grinned and shook his head.Thats exactly what we wont be doing, sir.If the site gets detected, we want them to focus on attacking the areas that appear like we made an effort to properly camouflage them.Well be placing decoy tents and heat generators on the ground beneath the spaced nets, and that might give them the impression that the center mound is nothing more than an empty mustering ground.Well even be marking the hill appropriately to that effect.We have little hope avoiding detection, so decoying is the only other viable option.The colonel nodded and quickly banished all doubt from his mind.
