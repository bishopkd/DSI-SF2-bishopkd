 Ten kilometers south of the Northern Wetlands Conservation Hub, 14H05, 5th of January 2750      First sergeant Devonport suppressed a renewed urge to vomit.He struggled to get his labored breathing under control, dismally aware that it was only a matter of time before his stomach betrayed him.If there was one thing he knew about motion sickness, it was that the nausea would only settle down once the movement that was causing it had subsided.He pushed the uncomfortable thought out of his mind and focused on his situation instead.Devonport knelt before the crest of a steep elevation, his surroundings cloaked by rain that had been pouring down since the end of the previous month.Near to him a few stunted trees stood, their trunks turned up in a way that suggested the wind blew uphill on its southern face.There was still some strength left in the days wind, although it was only a shadow of the katabatic storm that had preceded it.The gusts instilled slight rocking motions upon the MEHEI as he waited, his helmet playing the falling rains static sound endlessly into his ears.Well beyond the elevations summit, someone keyed a radio three times.To Devonports ears, the sound was barely audible above the background static, but still he tensed as he caught the unmistakable squawks, steeling himself for what was to come.Maybe if I croak therell be a footnote about me in some history book, he mused, a humorless smile spreading across his face.His severely cropped moustache, almost Hitlerian in design, brushed against the edges of the undersized mouth piece.Devonports stomach lurched as he rose to a standing position.He shifted his body forwards and began to advance in bounding strides, his pace picking up to a slow, ponderous jog.Pulling from its resting pylon his sole weapon for the coming fight, he then launched his armored Suit over the crest and became airborne.The new feeling that invaded him had very little to do with nausea.He landed heavily with seven tons of hardware tipping perilously forwards.He instinctively buckled his appendages, slamming a right kneepad into the waterlogged ground while allowing his left footpad to slide forward to counter an eventual roll.The impact shook his body, the hydraulic interfaces shock absorbing capability failing to entirely cancel out the vibrations.Gravity conspired with inertia to send him onwards with hardly diminished speed.He began to savor the ferrous taste of his own blood.He pounded his way down the tall hill, unable to see the way ahead except for a twenty meter extension before him, backsword held one handed and high over his pauldron.The thick bladed implement, originally a combat engineering tool, weighed over two hundred Kilo mass and was single edged, with the blade remaining rectangular right up to its abrupt end.The hilt allowed for a wide two handed grip suitable for felling trees, and more than a fifth of the weapons weight rested in its sizable tungsten pommel.The only disruption to its smooth design was a robust crow hook at the end of the back of the weapons blade.Devonport was counting on the crow hook to afford him victory in the fight to come.He picked up several frantic squawks over the comm from his advanced observer.Moments later a disembodied male voice began to offer warning in Japanese.Would be sweet if I knew what you were saying, kozo ...Devonport rasped at the automated voice.His view suddenly became obscured by several virtual panels offering him urgent instruction in Kanji writing.The sergeant smirked but forewent any witty remarks.If only he had figured out how to change the language settings, then he wouldnt be about to die from an overdose of ignorance.A twisted grin came to his face as the units operating system began to display icons of incoming targets.He was presently under missile attack.He increased his pace to a bone rattling sprint as the incoming missiles icons arced towards him.The fact that they were detectable at all made it clear that his units active threat detection system was somehow operating, basically made him trackable as well.Devonport had no clue as to how to deactivate it.He turned towards the approaching missiles, banking on the rain to disrupt the Bloodhounds infrared detection systems.Rockets began to slam into the surrounding area in quick succession, all except for the last, which suddenly caught his scent.Oh hell ...he muttered in alarm, as the icon that represented the missile streaked towards him.Before he could think of an appropriate reaction, the MEHEIs CPU took over, feeding quick instructions to the unit and its hydraulic interface.The articulated suit that enveloped Devonports body took on a life of its own and lurched forwards into a roll, the encapsulating chassis emulating its actions in almost perfect synchronicity.Warseed, christened as such by Devonport only the day before, rolled over the rough terrain as the missile struck the ground behind him and detonated.His body timed the gesture fluidly, raising the enormous frame onto its footpads after two stone shattering rolls before concluding the descent into the jumbled valley below.As he reached a collection of stunted trees, it all became too much for him.He vomited into his mouth piece and then clawed frantically at his face to tear it off, Warseeds upper appendages copying his grasping motions flawlessly.As soon as he had stopped heaving, Devonport reined his emotions in and tried to estimate his attackers location.He reckoned the nearest enemy unit to be a little more than a kilometer away.The sergeant crouched into imminent contact posture and began a slow advance, sticking close to the cover provided by terrain and trees as he tried to pick up the rumble of approaching armor.Suddenly, a much nearer engine began to turn.Warseeds principal power unit roared into life, forcing Devonport to put a kneepad to the ground as the turbines whine slowly chafed away at his depleted nerves.He prayed silently, hoping that the noise wasnt as deafening as it sounded from inside the unit.Three agonizing minutes later, the tank was fully pressurized and the engine quieted once more.He unfroze his mind and made a quick decision.He shut Warseed down and waited in its dark interface cavity for the system to reset to its default specifications.He then reactivated the Suit and was pleased to discover that the threat detection icon was no longer visible.Feeling almost painful relief as he regained stereoscopic vision, the sergeant began to creep forwards once more.Before long he came upon an oddly familiar landscape.Devonport had once been plagued by nightmares about labyrinths.However fantastic the creatures that populated their corridors were, though, what had terrified his younger self was the feeling of being hopelessly lost, every step into the maze only managing to take him further away from safety and familiarity.Devonport now found himself on the move inside such a labyrinth, its chaotic passages flanked by ferrous red clay walls or by twisted masses of vegetation.It was a land carved by flash floods from the monthly rains, the blood red flow having created a convoluted topography that offered no clue as to what lay within.The passages were still flooded and Devonport found himself sticking close to the walls to keep his noise signature down, managing to paint his unit red in the effort.That labyrinth also happened to be populated with its own exotic creatures.But what creatures they were, whether of the artillery kind or of the cavalry kind, and in what numbers, he couldnt hope to guess.Both carried the Bloodhound anti armor missile, the former defensively and the latter offensively; the missile attack thus offered no clear ID either way.He ignored the growing ball of fear in his stomach as he advanced for a kilometer, pausing before every turn to listen carefully.A nagging suspicion began to eat away at him, one that claimed that his adversary had shut down engines and was silently awaiting his approach.The Rains slowly gave up their claim over the sky; for the first time in many days, visibility returned to his world.A rapid succession of squawks cut through the silence.Devonport froze at once, holding his breath as his ears sharpened to take in every digitally scrubbed sound.He stood within a particularly wide passage that curved gently to his right.The right side wall was sloped and formed the beginning of a densely forested island, one that extended out for at least three hundred meters.He couldnt guess its maximum width from where he was, but saw that it rose to a good twenty meters above the natural passage.Four distinct squawks over the comm made his hackles rise.Devonports mind worked furiously; Imano had seen something important enough to make him risk compromise.He left the flooded passageway below and began to carefully ascend the island.As he slipped quietly into the trees, no more squawks made themselves heard.The sergeant advanced on all fours through the foliage, dragging the heavy blade so its crow hook wouldnt snag against roots over what felt like two thirds of the islands length.His observable universe became restricted to a ten meter radius of rain soaked flora.He consoled himself with the belief that if he were visible to the enemy, he would probably already have been fired upon.Two quick squawks pierced the silence and Devonport froze obediently.A few moments later he heard another three squawks, keyed slowly and deliberately.The speed of the squawks confused him, giving the impression of urging caution.When his spotter repeated the signal, Devonport slowly began to realize what he was trying to say.His heart began to beat steadily faster.He cautiously raised Warseed onto its footpads and approached the islands left edge, trying to avoid damaging the vegetation to keep his noise signature down.The island ended in a sheer drop off that afforded an ideal, if somewhat exposed, panorama of his surroundings.From there, he was able to discover that the passageway hed abandoned eventually widened before joining the enormous floodplain that divided the valley.He searched for tracks, finding none.Belatedly he realized that he wouldnt be finding any soon; the channel was still flooded with stagnant water.If his adversary was equipped with main battle tanks, his job of finding them had just become more difficult.The MBTs could maneuver and conceal themselves while submerged for quite some time before eventually needing to show themselves.He wondered how deep the waters were and peered cautiously over the sheer drop off before him.His eyes widened in astonishment.Below him, immobile and immense as they snuggled against the cliffs face, almost entirely obscured by the flood waters, were two self propelled artillery pieces.They looked like obese crocodiles as they lay in wait, their tracks and chassis entirely hidden in the crimson water, only their colossal heads, long slender snouts and the tops of their towed ammunition trailers visible.The only things about them that broke the reptilian look were the elaborate muzzle brakes at the ends of their barrels.The unit nearest to him, at rest directly below, had its barrel trained on the passageway he had been using only minutes ago.Its sibling was guarding against rear attack.Silently he prayed his warmest thanks, praising Imano for his divine guidance.Devonport didnt believe in God, but Imano was a Buddhist and a life saver, and he deserved a prayer or two.A direct hit from an artillery round would have been enough to make him find out whether God was more than just a fine idea.Devonport carefully studied the nearest crocodiles head and realized that it was entirely caked with red mud; it was the upgraded OAP 3 that the boys from Fort Kiba werent supposed to have, which meant that if he didnt destroy them in that moment, the vehicles would be able to make their escape into the water just like any MBT.He finally located what he was looking for; a circular hatch on the far side of the oversized turret, almost entirely obscured by a layer of clay.A less knowledgeable soldier might have confused it with the rebated radar dish on the turrets opposite side, but Devonport had been privileged to begin his career as an artilleryman.Springing into action, the sergeant launched his unit over the drop off and landed with all four appendages upon the OAPs turret, graying out for a brief moment as the resounding shock from the impact nearly overcame him.Sucking it up, he quickly stood and lodged his backswords crow hook into the crevasse between the hatch and its casing.Using the tungsten rhenium blade as an improvised crow bar, he then popped the hatch off its turret with remarkably little effort.He had expected no less than that result; the OAPs hatch simply hadnt been designed to deal with so much leverage.All at once things began to happen.As Devonport peered into the gaping hole he had just made, the OAP beneath him jerked into motion.The supporting OAP began to traverse its barrel , the turning turrets rear biting deeply into the soft cliff wall against which it was nestled.The sergeant launched himself towards the supporting OAP, landing gratefully short of his target into the far more yielding water.Planting his footpads securely on the muddy channel bed, he waded towards his second adversary in frenzied desperation, already imagining the first artillery platforms barrel aiming at his backplate.Dipping his helm beneath the second OAPs traversing main gun, he hugged the tank and chanced a quick glance to his rear.The first artillery piece was nowhere to be seen.Clambering onto his new prey, Devonport repeated his previous performance, prying the hatch off the artillery pieces still traversing turret as its barrel began to push into the cliff face itself.Not wasting another second, the sergeant thrust his gauntlet into the turret and began to swat at whatever hid inside.It was easy to distinguish man from metal.In a brief pair of seconds, Devonport was sure he had killed or seriously maimed at least two of the five crewmembers who operated the platform.The first, probably the ammunition handler, he crushed against the ammo rack at the turrets rear, the hollow thump of Warseeds gauntlet against his flak jacket making it clear that the man would be doing nothing for what remained of his life.The second, probably the commander if seating arrangement was anything to go by, tried to shy away from his searching grip like a puppy from an obsessed toddler.As Devonport closed his gauntlet around the soldiers torso, he heard the loud pop of a pistol going off, followed by a sound more horrifying than any he had heard before.It was more of a high pitched bark than it was a scream, but it still signaled the end of a life.The OAPs main gun fired into the clay wall and the entire cliff came crashing down.Devonport hastily released his victim, rolling into the water before most of the compacted clay could bury him.The sergeant pulled himself free of the collapsed cliff face to find the artillery piece interred by its own landslide.A rumbling roar from behind caused him to snap about.He was just in time to see part of the opposite cliff face collapse into the water.Still unsure of the first OAPs location, he decided to break radio silence.Scryer, this is Champion.Inform location of first hostile!Youre looking at it, Champion.Say again, Scryer.I said youre looking at it, kozo.Your first hostile fled into deep water without knowing it didnt have a hatch any more.It mustve flooded and kept on going until it hit the wall.Right now your first hostiles as buried as your second is.Not bad for a guy with a can opener ...The sergeant took a second look at the distant land slide, finding that it was located right where the first OAP would have reached if it had kept moving in a straight line.Roger that, Looker.Inform if your post has further threats on its scope, over.This post bids yours farewell and good luck, kozo, Imano replied sadly, my scope is full of incoming   The communication cut off as several flashes brightened the overcast day.Devonport turned and watched in astonishment as the hill where his observer was embedded was pummeled by dozens of artillery rounds.They were closely followed by streaking missiles that dispersed antipersonnel bomblets over its surface, subsequently tearing the hill apart.The cacophony of detonations finally reached his ears, their massive reports making real what had only a moment ago seemed like another dream creatures appearance.Imano was dead.If he wasnt dead, he was almost certainly dying.Devonport digested that fact with more difficulty than he would have thought possible.In another part of his mind, the analyst was quietly at work, duly noting that the units hed just dispatched had probably only been an improvised screening force.If the enemy had managed to triangulate his observers location finely enough to order an artillery strike, then that meant the presence of E warfare units and dedicated artillery batteries, which implied that a combined arms force was at play.That in turn meant that Fort Kiba had disgorged its entire complement, MBTs included.Warseeds principal power unit sputtered into life again.Devonport hardly took notice; he was too engrossed with the sight of the debris as it rained down upon the ravaged hill.The rains had ended, he realized as his head begin to throb, taking away the one edge he could ever really have counted on.There was no longer any reason to remain there, but still he considered the hill as it resettled, realizing that it was possibly his decision to break radio silence that had cost Imano his life.I killed the man who saved my life, he concluded, aghast at the scale of his sin.Moving with the sluggishness of the shell shocked, Devonport turned towards the supporting OAPs burial site and began to search for his discarded backsword.It wouldnt be wise to return to battle unarmed.ONE      20 kilometers east of Leiben, 03H00, 7th of January, 2771 (21 years later)      Toni peered into the fog and thanked the family gods for the concealment it afforded.He winced as he heard a cry in the distance and reminded himself again of how much of an idiot he was.He could have left without warning, of course.In fact, every rational bone in his body had urged him to do just that.He had decided instead to leave a goodbye note upon his bed before leaving.The desperate voice in the distance belonged to his mother, his sweet mother who, possessed by her uncanny maternal sonar, must have gone into his bedroom to check on him.He had been hearing her voice for the better part of the last half hour, calling for him.Toni refused to run, however.Running was something a child would do, and he firmly believed himself to no longer be one.Even so, he hastened his pace.The fog had Toni wondering whether he would soon be in need of shelter.Peering up was pointless, the unrelenting mist shielding the sky beyond, hiding any clues as to his immediate future.The fact that it was presently the seventh day of the month offered the only clue as to the weather he could expect.At that time of the month, the sky could be counted upon to be overcast, with a persisting presence of fog, drizzle, or even light showers from the second to the eighth before the crimson sun finally made its appearance.It was only day three since the Great Rains had come to an end.As he journeyed over the winding dirt road, he finally set his eyes on something that gave him a firm idea as to his location.Under his feet the road began to rise until, several paces ahead and at its highest point, a familiar ochre red wall appeared to his left.He ran his hand along the rough wall, feeling the rock like bark grating against his skin, feeling the looser fibers in the intermittent gaps giving way as his fingers scraped along.The road curved around the wall for quite a few more steps before finally breaking off at a downward slope.Toni followed the road, sparing only the briefest glance at the tree behind him, its massive trunk disappearing up into the fog.Today was no day to peer at the silent sentinel.Tonis heart sank as he spied a more humble redwood at the roadside.Leaning nonchalantly against it with arms crossed and a furrowed brow, Kaya Miura awaited her brothers silent approach.As he halted hesitantly before her, she uncrossed her arms and shoved her slim fingers into her coat pockets.She was wearing the brown leather jacket.He had worn it once, and knew that its pockets interiors were lined with genet fur.It was an extravagant coat, quite appropriate for the tall woman who stood before him, appraising him with that critical expression he hated so much.He couldnt help but see his father there.So ...she finally said, did you hear your mother?Did you hear her calling for you?Silently he nodded.And?she asked, the furrow on her brow deepening.Dont you have anything to say?Theres nothing to say, he replied, despairing at the softness of his voice.Nothing to say?Nothing?You ungrateful little prick, she remarked quietly.He grimaced at her tone, recognizing it for what it was: the light breeze before the storm.If he allowed her to get up to full steam, Kaya would soon be yelling loudly enough to trip mothers sonar and draw her in like stellar gravity.He hurried to cut her off.Its not a matter of being grateful, I cant be what you want me   You hid your final marks from us, she continued.More skillfully than I would have expected, I must admit.But using my password was a bit much, dont you think?Was there some hidden message there?Were you sticking your tongue out at me?Three days ago, Tonis final examination results had finally arrived at the Miura residence by conventional mail, removing from the household all doubts as to who had been tampering with the domestic servers electronic mail.Well?she insisted.No, he lied.I needed to make time until I had an answer from the Forces.I thought that if I deleted the messages, I   You coward ...The word was kick to the gut, and it silenced him instantly.I know, he conceded.You wanted to know why, so Im telling you why.And I guess you realized wed just think it was the money pits fault, right?The Miura households domestic server, affectionately known as the Money Pit, was more than thirty years old, having survived multiple ownership over the course of its existence.The forestation company his father had bought it from had neglected to entirely clear the computers memory banks and so, once reconnected to the grid at its new place of residence, it had showed some entrepreneurial spirit, acquiring countless seedlings of several tree species to the detriment of their bank account.His opportunistic mother had made the best of the mistake and quietly set to work, planting the seedlings around their farms perimeter and tasking Toni to care for them until they found their footing in the soil.The computer was subsequently lobotomized, although its reliability suffered a nosedive as a result.It was, in fact, the familys lack of confidence in their connection to the General Civilian Network that had allowed him to get away with his deception for so long.Yeah, I guess so.I also knew that without moms or dads authentication codes, Southwood would just find another way to send the letters.I just didnt expect it to be so soon.Dad threatened the school, Leiben varsity and the GCN employees with prosecution, he kept calling them incompetent.He had to call them back and apologize!she said with rising anger.I know, I was there when he made the call ...Youre a worm, you know that?Youve brought dishonor to our   This is the problem, right here ...he muttered under his breath as dull anger began to fester.What?What did you say, shrimp?You sure you want a piece of me?she challenged.I wont ever be anything like this.What?I said I wont ever be anything like this!You step on me.Father steps on me   You screw up, thats   Let me speak!he spat.There was enough anger pressed into those words to give her pause.She watched him coolly, her expression momentarily subdued.I dont care if I screw up!he continued, speaking as loudly as he dared.From now on Ill screw up on my terms.Where Im going I wont have this insane family to tear me up from the inside out!No.Youll just have some drill instructor to do that for us!You think we were hard on you?Wait until you get a load of them!Theyll break your fragile heart and send you home crying, she finished with a laugh.No, they wont, he countered with certainty.I can take them on because theyre not family, which means Ill be free to hate them without having to feel ashamed about it.And even if I dont make it somehow, you shouldnt stand around waiting for me to return.If I fail, Ill just walk into the wild until I find a research hub out there.I dont care to return even if it means within a week Ill be eating the bark off of trees.What I feel for all of you now is the worst kind of hate.Ive been trying to repress this, but the feeling just wont go away ...His words seemed to have made an impression on his older sister.Kaya leaned against the redwood again and listened to the forest sounds, or maybe for some clue as to his mothers whereabouts.Her anger appeared to have abated, and there was a hint of doubt on her features, although perhaps that was just a trick of shadows.What we have here is a failure to communicate, she finally said.I dont really care whether you hate me or not.My conscience is clear on that point.But you might want to reconsider those feelings in relation to Sarah.Shes attached to you, and your leavings going to leave a mark there that might   Go to hell.I knew you were gonna pull the Sarah Card out sooner or later.Shell do fine.Shes got two older sisters to take care of her, besides mother.As for me, Im eighteen years old, my studies are done and Ive been accepted into MEWAC.Mewhat?MEWAC.Mechanized Warfare Corps.Im on my way there now.On foot?Its not that far away ...A slow smile slowly began to spread across her face.So you want to break out into the world and be independent.You want to be autonomous, a great warrior, whatever.And youll be within walking distance of the farm?Dont overexert yourself there, soldier.As he always tended to do in such moments, Toni wondered whether his sister loved him.So tell me about this MEWAC, she demanded.Its ...Its a sort of fusion of old infantry and cavalry units from the Henderson and Kumato research hubs.Its home base is the Adamastor warehouse.That a very big aquarium for such a small fish, she remarked more to herself than to him.For the briefest of moments, he suddenly wasnt too keen on getting there.Then he remembered what had drawn him to MEWAC in the first place; it was the outfit to join if one wanted to drive a Hammerhead Suit.What about the Military Academy?It might be a bit much for you, but at least dad might respect you a little more.Toni grimaced.I applied for both the MA and the Army Sergeant School.The Academy didnt even bother to reply, the Sergeant School just sent me the application form for MEWAC.I filled it in and got an answer yesterday.You mean I got an answer yesterday.Youve been using my user account, I checked the activity log.I knew mom was checking up on mine, so ...yes.Wonderful.And their reply?Toni grudgingly handed his sister the printed sheet.Her eyebrows slowly rose as she studied the document.Two spelling mistakes ...she observed distastefully.Anyway, it says incorporation dependent upon approval.Which means you havent even been approved yet.To an outfit whose soldiers apparently dont know how to spell ...She handed the sheet back to Toni with disdain and he refolded it, trying not to let his feelings show.He had already been painfully aware of what she had said.He wondered whether soon he really would be eating the bark off trees.I have to go, he finally said.Sure.I wouldnt want to keep you from abandoning your family.However, mother told me that if I chanced to come across you, it was my solemn responsibility to warn you to inform base medical services about your folic acid deficiency.My  what?Yes, your folic acid deficiency.She never bothered to tell us about it, but shes been supplementing our meals with the stuff, it apparently runs in her side of the family.You can be sure the canteens wont be supplementing your meals, so youll have to inform the medical department about that.Toni was dubious.Does that even exist?Im sure as hell not going to hang myself by the tongue at medical, Kaya.Goodbye, he muttered as he skirted around his sister, giving her a wide berth.Thats just fine, then, Im sure youll be getting all the supplementation you need when youre eating the bark off trees.I heard theyve got a lot of folic acid, she taunted, rubbing the redwood beside her.It took him only a dozen steps to lose her in the fog.*****      The sounds of the forest were beginning to make themselves heard.Toni checked his digital watch; it read a quarter past four in the morning.But of course the critters didnt know that, and so they kept to whatever timetable they had figured out for themselves.By the looks of it, at least some squirrels had decided it was daytime, and he could see a pair of them foraging among the roots of a Tanoak to his left.He wondered for the millionth time what true night might be like.Close your eyes and youll know, his father had joked the first time Toni asked that question.He had learned to never expect a straight answer from his father, and had long suspected that that was a treatment the old man reserved only for his son.He felt relieved all over again to be walking away from Mushima farm.His encounter with Kaya had only strengthened his resolve.He increased the length of his stride, dreading to be late for his first encounter with military life.His backpack felt heavier, and he had begun to switch it from one shoulder to the other more often.His surroundings were becoming noisier.Birds chirped musically as some began to take flight, and at last it became clear to him that the forest had decided it was daytime.Natures dawn had finally arrived.Despite everything he had been taught about Natures adaptation to his home planet, Toni still found its biological clock fascinating.In the complete absence of day night cycles, the forests had adopted their own circadian rhythm of about twenty two hours, although the cycle length happened to vary depending on the time of month.On more than one class excursion out to the groves, Toni and his primary school mates had been instructed to sit silently and listen to the forest as it woke.It was a rare day when Natures Dawn coincided with the chronological one.But Natures Dawn was not a simultaneous continent wide event.It progressed in waves, the gradual increase in wildlife activity propagating across the countryside like a planet wide Mexican wave.That wave moved along at over a hundred kilometers per hour and was eleven hundred kilometers deep, sometimes taking more than two weeks to make a full circuit around the Thaumantian supercontinents arid center.There were never less than twelve such dawn waves in motion at any time, although very rarely dawns fused, or spontaneously emerged from between sister waves that were unusually far apart, or even swirled and eddied over vast mountain ranges and other geographical features.Once faced with a time lapse simulation of the event on a continent wide scale, it had appeared to Toni as if a giant hypnotic eye was hard at work, trying to bewitch him.The tree roots under his feet had become so densely intermingled that he was having difficulty keeping his footing.The road had since been demoted to a long disused path, but it was already too late to think about turning back.Besides, there was supposed to be nothing else out there except for the base.He maintained his heading, swallowing his anxiety as the minutes passed by.Half an hour later, the road promisingly began to look well traveled again, and every once in a while he would find a dirt path leading off it, wide enough for a single column of men to travel through.Visibility had also begun to improve and Toni could see farther out around him.He groaned inwardly, knowing that it was now only a matter of time before it began to rain.He kept following the dirt road until finally he spied something that made his heart leap.He took a quick look at his watch: it was a quarter to six.Two hundred meters down an arrow straight paved road, there was an ornate wrought iron military gate with a solitary black sentry box standing beside it.To the left was a white washed wall of about a mans height, and it led off into the forest without any end in sight.A wall on the other side led off diagonally into the forest.After an exhilarating sprint, Toni came to a skidding halt in front of the gate.A quick look at the sentry box provided him with yet another setback; it was quite empty.The gate must open at six oclock sharp, he finally realized.The avian chirping slowly grew to become a nuisance, and Toni saw a number and variety of birds beyond count in flight, or pecking along the ground in ever closer proximity to him as he rested on a rock with his pack beside him.As Toni tried unsuccessfully to attract the attention of several marauding crows, the long expected drizzle finally began to fall, reducing visibility again as well as chilling Toni to the bone.He removed an oversized jersey from his pack and used it to cover his shoulders like a cloak before perching a wide brimmed farmers hat on his head, an accessory as useful to keep his head dry as to prevent the birds overhead from painting a target on his crown.The minutes ticked slowly away and, to Tonis growing bewilderment, not a single recruit showed up at the gate.He checked his watch again.It was a quarter past the hour, and that undoubtedly meant he was late.Anxiety lurched forwards and took center stage in his heart, reminding him in exquisite detail of the shame that awaited him were he to fail.He walked over to the gate and gave it a long, hard stare.He then shifted his weight back and launched himself forward, sending a boot against the gate in frustration.The sudden impact of work boot against iron produced a resounding metallic clang.To Tonis utter surprise, the sentinel box to his left shuddered violently, and a tall figure enshrouded in a black cloth suddenly jumped out, only to collapse to the ground with a thud.Uff!HALT!WHO GOES THERE?the figure bellowed loudly, trying to stand as it did so.It finally managed to free itself from its covering and a compact looking rifle fell clattering to the ground at his feet.A crack trooper he certainly wasnt.Toni suppressed the urge to face palm as the soldier quickly gathered the rifle up with spider like arms.He wore a vomit green uniform a little short at his arms and legs, which made some sense, seeing as his extremities were a little long for the body he had been graced with.The expression on the sentinels face as he spotted the newcomer summed his intellect up nicely.Oh, for the love of  The soldier coughed twice and then spat.Composing himself, he turned to Toni.Hell, you had me thinking the Lieutie had caught me at it again!he gasped with relief.Hey ...Toni said, I thought there was no one in there ...Oh, just doing the curtain routine.Get some sleep without the critters bothering me.If I knew Parkinson had let someone out, I wouldve been expecting you.So, ya want in?He asked, hooking his thumb towards the gate.Im here to be incorporated, Toni stated bluntly.The sentinel stood there for what seemed like a long time, studying Toni anew.Youre a ...a rook?Uh ...yes, I guess so.Listen, the sheet says oh six hundred and Im already fifteen minutes late ...The sentinel quickly checked his watch, and then marched over to him and put his hand out.Toni shook it, taking note that the soldier possessed retard strength.Im Derek Rooney, but everyone calls me Stick.Get your gear, Im gonna open the gate!Toni.Thanks.Before long Toni found himself inside a military base for the first time in his life, his pack shaking and leaping as he coursed down a paved road at a good sprint.Stick had turned out to be a mate.The lanky sentinel had given a brief explanation on how to get to the Suit parade ground, the usual mustering spot for recruits.Before Toni had been about to break into a run, however, the soldier had stopped him.Listen, you look like youre a mate, so Ill give you some advice I didnt chance to get.Only two things.Dont ever trust a comrade right off, not even the friendly ones, cause some of them are the pits.That includes the other recruits.And when you get hammered down in the Click, dont ever give up.Giving up will cost you the Suit, and youll never get that shot again!OK?Good luck, rook!Following Sticks directions, Toni kept along the paved road for a full kilometer, occasionally spotting collections of small white washed huts to his flanks as he sped along.Sure enough, he soon saw to his left an enormous parade ground.Dead center on those granite grey grounds, he saw a motley group about fifty strong huddled together.Beyond the parade ground was a much denser collection of buildings, white the dominant color there as well.As sweat burned, Toni put in a final burst of speed and ate up the heavily scratched and pitted parade ground.Beyond the group of civilians, he saw a heavyset soldier standing sentinel, his legs widely spaced apart as he watched over them.He came to a stop beside the group and wiped the sweat from his eyes for a better look.The recruits wore terrified expressions and stood in a formation three lines deep, their luggage having been piled in a disorganized heap behind them.The soldier standing before them seemed almost inhuman, although Toni couldnt place what made him so uncannily robotic.He was in his forties, with a smart black cap parked on his shaved head and a geometrically shaped goatee surrounding his almost lipless mouth.His sky blue eyes remained fixed on the formation before him, giving Toni the impression that he hadnt registered Tonis arrival.Toni pulled out the printed attachment of the mail hed been sent and cleared his throat.Sir, uh, Toni Miura reporting for duty!Sir!he added, considering that one sir wasnt enough for the occasion.The soldier didnt budge and kept his robotic vigil over the formation before him.Toni wondered what he was doing wrong.And then, in a flash, an epiphany came to him.He fired off a salute.The soldiers head snapped towards Toni as if it had been spring loaded.Someone in the crowd groaned as if he had suddenly fallen ill.The soldiers mouth gaped as if he was about to say something, and his eyes opened so wide that Toni could see the whites of his eyes above and below his irises.Despite his alarm, Toni noticed that the man had no eyebrows.WHAT!THE FUCK!DO YA THINK!YOURE DOING?YOU UNDERFED!UNDERBRED!UNDERSIZED!LITTLE SHIT!!the soldier finally screamed at the top of his lungs.He made for Toni with a fast, almost spastic march, stopping only when his ruddy nose was brushing against the rookies forehead.YOU WILL NOT!I REPEAT NOT!EVER!SALUTE IN CIVILIAN CLOTHING AGAIN!THIS IS NOT SOME NAVY!AIRFORCE!OR OTHERWISE SUBSTANDARD OUTFIT!YOU WILL NOT SALUTE IN CIVVS!YOU WILL NOT SALUTE WITHOUT A HEAD COVERING!AND MOST OF ALL!YOU WILL NOT SALUTE!UNTIL YALL HAVE BEEN TAUGHT WHEN!WHERE!AND HOW!TO SALUTE!ARE WE CLEAR, BOY?Very clear, sir!Toni answered quickly, trying to ignore the spittle accumulating on his eyelashes.THATS FIRST SERGEANT MASON TO YA!ROOK!Very clear!First sergeant!Toni declared.Sergeant Mason took a quick step back and snatched the printed letter from Tonis hand, read through it quickly, and then consulted the list on his clipboard with a jerky motion.With another quick jerk he checked his watch.Why are you late?he demanded, having apparently fallen into remission.I was let in through the gate to the east, First Sergeant.I didnt ...Sergeant will do.Yes, Sergeant.I didnt know any other way here.I came on foot, sir.And that constitutes an excuse to you, rook?he inquired, a smirk beginning to twist his face.No, Sergeant.I thought not.Up front.No luggage.NOW!Mason bellowed, pointing with his clipboard to the spot where he had been a moment ago.Toni hastily discarded his packs and jogged to the head of the troop, his stomach sinking anew.Mason cleared his throat extravagantly and then fired off like a cannon.OUR FELLA!HERE!he bellowed, pointing the clipboard towards Toni and, accidentally or not, smacking it against his temple, HAS DECIDED TO BE TARDY!NOW SUCH AN INFARCTION!HAS AN UNREASONABLY CHEAP PRICE OF FIVE!I REPEAT FIVE!PRESS UPS!EACH WILL BE DONE BY HIM!AND THEN DONE BY YALL!I WANNA HEAR THE NUMBERS!LOUD AND CLEAR!Sergeant Mason eyed Toni ecstatically and bellowed one final order into his ear: NOW!Toni didnt need to be told twice.He fell on his hands, waiting for the entire platoon to do the same, and immediately flexed his arms against the earth once.Amidst myriad grunts and groans, the platoon followed suit.Before he could complete the second, Mason interrupted them.I WANNA HEAR THE NUMBERS!AGAIN!Toni started from scratch and bellowed out a hoarse one.This, apparently, was also unsatisfactory in Masons idea of how the exercise should proceed.Before long Toni discovered that zero was a valid number at MEWAC, and one to be reckoned with, seeing as he ended up doing at least a dozen zeros before Mason allowed him to continue.The sergeant was also highly demanding of proper execution, and every time they neared five, he would find someone who wasnt performing properly and Toni would find himself at zero once again.He had lost count of how many press ups they had performed when a boys hoarse voice piped from inside the formation.I dont need this!Sergeant, Ive had enough!A dark haired boy finally poked his head above the collection of backs and backsides, his face glistening and his hair plastered to his forehead with sweat and fallen drizzle.ON YER FEET!ALL OF YA!Mason screamed, a mad grin on his face as he surveyed the damage.The platoon wavered like a grove of trees in the midst of a storm, some recruits coughing while other rooted their hands to their thighs as if that was the only thing keeping them up.Toni saw that some recruits had something written on their foreheads and he tried to make it out, but then Sergeant Masons smirking red face filled his field of view.Dontcha move, rook, Ive got my inspiration ...He took out what appeared to be a marking pen.Wiping Tonis forehead with his sleeve, Mason began to painfully scrawl something there, biting his own tongue in concentration as he formed the letters.Finally satisfied, he turned around.YO!FAGGOT!YA QUIT SO YA GET YA GEAR!OUTTA HERE!AND MISTER TARDY HERE!TAKES YA PLACE!With a flourish, Mason struck the washouts name from his clipboard and then elaborately beckoned Toni to join the group.Feeling light headed, Toni left his packs where the others were collected and headed towards the boys place in formation, whispering a raspy apology to him as they passed each other by.Good luck ...the boy whispered back, although his expression said otherwise, and Toni thought he heard someone whisper asshole from nearby.He felt deeply ashamed for the briefest of moments, but then he throttled the emotion.No need to be the good guy, he admonished himself as he took his place.TWO      MEWAC training grounds, 07H00, 7th of January, 2771      Fat drops drummed heavily against the taut canvass above Tonis head.He hurried to change into the stained uniform hed been handed, occasionally bumping shoulders with the other recruits as they hurried to do the same.The uniform was vomit green, had most of its pockets missing or hanging by their threads, and sported a few brown smears of suspicious origin.Some uniforms were in even worse shape, and every once in a while he would hear a ripping sound followed by loud cursing.Toni had since managed to get a better look at his new companions, and had also taken the time to read the graffiti present on some of their faces.One short and stocky recruit, whose dirty blonde eyebrows met at a very hairy junction between his eyes, had SCARYBROW scrawled in capital letters, the brows having been used as a writing line.Another recruit, his mouth determinedly closed as he clothed himself in a dolmen missing most of its buttons, had BUCK written on his left cheek and TEETH on his right in bold, square lettering.Some other notable examples were SPAZ, TRAGEDY, CRATERFACE and GAWKER.First sergeant Mason had been appeased by the sole sacrifice on the grounds.As the defeated boy trudged away, the soldier had organized the group into a double column, and they had then set off at a blistering pace, leaving their luggage behind to soak in the rain.For most of the way, Mason had simply refused to march in a straight line, preferring instead to zig zag his way randomly among the trees in one general direction.With every turn he put on a renewed burst of speed, periodically circling a large tree or some other landmark like a manic tour guide.Eventually he led them to a densely wooded area, where the ground was churned up and the trees wore scars, some quite deep and old.By that time the old sergeants ears were cherry red from the effort, but still he kept up the pace.Mason then received a call on a very battered looking SatPhone, and their trajectory had then become a straight shot towards their final destination.They had arrived at a clearing where three large camouflage tents stood erected, a dozen soldiers of diverse ranks loitering between them.Over the course of those first few minutes, Toni had figured that the more decorative the insignias on their shoulders, the higher the soldiers rank.The big shot on location, a small but wiry man with a very tense jaw, exhibited a pair of silver stars on each shoulder, and he sneered at the recruits for a brief moment before continuing his conversation with the grizzled soldier beside him.Aside from a pair of busy looking youths whose shoulders were adorned with red stripes, the remainder lacked any insignia at all and, unsurprisingly, they had been the busiest of the lot.In one quick minute, the busy soldiers had distributed uniforms with no regard for size and, more depressingly, they had also handed out crash helmets and anti trauma padding.The last offering had been flexible neck braces.And so it was that, by ten minutes past seven in the morning, with the rain pelting down with uncharacteristic intensity, the group of terrified recruits was formed up between the tents, the wiry commander standing before them with a crooked smile on his face.As the rain intensified further, drumming deafeningly against Tonis crash helmet, the commander opened his mouth to speak.Toni groaned inwardly.He found himself in the rearmost row of the formation, the hammering rain on his helmet broadcasting static into his ears, and the speaker lacked the public speaking ability of First sergeant Screaming Mason.Toni strained his ears, managing only to pick up a few snatches of the discourse....to never, ever forget the name of your superiors.My name is Lieutenant ......manage to complete the Click in the set time and proper fashion, you will have the honor and privilege to ......at any time you have any doubts on where to go, you need only to ......and if you fall short of the mark here, you can forget about ever ...The Lieutenants speech went on for a while, with Toni all but clueless as to what he was saying.He was not alone, not if the other recruits puzzled expressions were anything to go by.All he managed to learn was that the selection process would involve an obstacle course known as the Click.The Lieutenant conferred briefly with Sergeant Mason as the recruits whispered amongst one another, all apparently at a loss as to what was to happen next.Their eyes darted forwards once more to a familiar throat clearing.Sergeant Mason glared at Tonis puzzled expression for a few moments before sounding off.THE CLICK!WILL BE COMPLETED!IN ORDER OF ARRIVAL!IN OTHER WORDS!THE LAST GO FIRST!MISTER TARDY!FRONT AND CENTER!Mason bellowed.Tonis stomach lurched dangerously.He quickly exited the formation, only to be screamed back into it, having apparently committed another no no.After a quick minute of instruction, example and execution on the right way to fall out of formation, he was finally allowed to depart from the platoon towards what was termed the warm up location.It might once have been a wide circle set within a pebbled perimeter, but the sheer number of boots that had already pounded the area within its boundary had depressed the ground below, and the rain had done the rest.All that remained for it to be a pond was the Koi fish.Five paces beyond the circle was a rising rope ladder under guard of a young red striped soldier.Toni splashed along inside the circle, self consciously wind milling his arms under Masons murderous gaze, glancing at the end of every lap towards the flimsy ladder as it disappeared up into a confusion of tree branches.Forging his way through the icy water, he heard a thunderous horn reverberate across the forest as if trumpeted by some mythical war god.The sound was so deep and low he felt it resonate inside his chest, almost shaking him.A wicked grin began to spread across Masons face.Any time now, boy!the soldier shouted.What?That was the starting horn!Get a move on, or would you prefer to keep the Sarge company?!Oh ...Toni muttered, and he set off at a run towards the ladder.DONT BREAK YER NECK, SUNSHINE!Mason bellowed after him, his taunting laugh following Toni as he began to assault the ladder.The rope ladder began to swing back and forth as he climbed, and his already upset stomach slowly began to liquefy.As he ascended, Toni forced himself to resist the urge to look up, since every time he did so hed get two eyefuls of rain and be forced to pause, blinking blindly as he swayed until vision returned.Not daring to look down either, Toni stared out into the woods as he gripped each wooden rung, progressing more cautiously the higher he climbed.Finally accepting the fact that he had exceeded the height where a fall would be fatal, he settling into a monotonous rung by rung climbing routine until the sound of raindrops beating against wood caused him to look up.Just above and to his right he found a collection of thick branches interlinked with a dense web of rope and, nailed to the nearest, a weathered plastic sign stating EXIT HERE.Toni abandoned the ladder, scrambling clumsily along the confusing cobweb until the challenge beyond caused him to pause.Attached to the trunk and to two diverging branches was an arrangement of taut cables forming a V, interconnected by ropes for every meter of their considerable length.The rope bridge disappeared into the forest with no end in sight.Not bothering to see where the other end was attached, he set off, gripping the two upper cables with white knuckles as he carefully paced along the lower one.He kept his eyes fixed on the bottom cable as he carefully placed his feet, counting his steps as he advanced to keep himself from thinking about how far from the ground he was.At his thirtieth step he dared to peer forwards.Before him, maybe ten paces away, a hovering, pitch black triangle enclosed the rope bridge.The sight was so disconcerting it bordered on the unreal, but the rain spattering off the triangles top facet finally comforted him as to its solidity.Cautiously he advanced.As Toni reached it he sighed in relief.The obstacles builders had wrapped the remainder of the cable bridge in a latex like material, leaving a dark, triangular tunnel within which he could continue.Carefully pressing his hand against the material, he found it rubbery and alarmingly elastic.Doubting that the material could bear his weight, Toni cautiously entered the tunnel.What moments before had seemed achievable gradually became a nightmare.Only a few paces beyond the sky tunnels entrance it became so dark, finding the bottom cable was a matter of feeling with his feet rather than seeing.To make matters worse, Toni was forced to stoop to keep from rubbing his helmet against the springy ceiling, and the elastic wrapping pressed against the support cables with enough pressure to make them difficult to grasp.Ten paces later, darkness dominated.Toni began to constantly glance behind him for reassurance as he progressed, the compulsion only serving to destroy his night vision, leaving a white triangle imprinted on his retina when he turned to face forwards once more.His labored breathing was greatly amplified by the tunnel, and the rains drumming against the fabric more than replaced the static that had been playing into his ears.As his thighs began to burn from their constant flexing, Toni resorted to using the transverse ropes set along the bridge as tactile guides for his feet.As he was setting his weight on to a front foot, a powerful gust swayed the bridge and he slipped.Unable to see anything to grasp at, he hooked his arms out blindly, but then he found himself lying on his back instead, bouncing in the darkness with nothing to hold on to.His stomach convulsed, and he left a sopping gift on the elastic wrapping for the following recruit.Toni finally realized that he had underestimated the materials resilience.Finding the bottom cable suspended just above his head, he gripped it to lift himself back up, but then reconsidered.Instead he chose to leapfrog his way along the bottom.In a few short bounds he reached the opposite end and found it in darkness as well, and he climbed out of the sky tunnel and into an enclosed and darkened space.Toni began to reach out methodically, trying to form a mental map of the compartment he was in.There appeared to be a dense mesh of rope filling up the gaps between an array of tree limbs and, where his hands managed to poke through, they were met by the same elastic material that had broken his fall.His hand then gripped something hard and leathery, and he felt his way up, squeezing his eyebrows together in the darkness as he began to pull at the strings that bound the item together.Yes, it is a boot, you twit!a disembodied voice rasped, and said boot suddenly kicked out, clipping Toni smartly on his chin.Alright mate, lets send you on your way!The voice groaned with sudden effort and something smacked heavily against Tonis helmet, propelling him towards his right side with a deafening clang.Toni was struck again and yet again, his surprised exclamations adding to the clangor until, with one final collision, he was sent headfirst down a chute.He was inside tunnel of slippery polymer construction and quickly gathering speed.He gave up trying to brake his descent and instead wrapped his arms around his head, anticipating a collision.To his surprise the tunnels angle became shallower as he descended until he slid to a complete stop.Toni peered forwards and saw a disk of light before him.He groped forwards on his stomach, cursing the surface for being so slippery as he tried to gain traction with his nails.He finally reached the opening and passed through into the blinding light.Hello, newborn!Time for your spanking, someone said and, before Tonis eyes could adjust to the light, he was once again under assault.In the moments before he was ushered into another hole with a heavily padded sledgehammer, Toni managed to discover that he was on the ground again, ground meaning a tied raft in the middle of a watercourse.The thick tube he was being ushered into snaked along ahead of him, rising and falling into the water and snaking about like a giant serpent.The usher, equipped with the ridiculous motivator, seemed to be having the time of his life.As Toni began crawling into the tube, he felt the soldier hook something to his trouser leg.The obstacle before him soon put that out of his mind.Toni was in darkness once more, but the tunnel had had sand resined to its walls and he was able to progress with greater speed, shuffling along until first his hands and elbows found water, and then the rest of his torso.His left leg felt as if a dog had latched onto it and elected to be dragged along, but the numbing cold soon put the beast to sleep along with that extremity.As the water lapped at his upraised chin, Tonis hand slapped against the tunnels sealed end.For a long moment, he blinked in the darkness, his hand scraping along the wall before him, pushing hard against it in the insane hope that it would somehow pop off.A sudden feeling of claustrophobia stole over him, and he began to hammer his fist repeatedly against the abrasive wall.He stopped hammering as quickly as he had started.His right hand had slipped downwards, dipping into unexpectedly deeper and cooler water.The tunnel continued on downwards through a slim passageway.Whatever it was that had attached itself to his leg suddenly came alive and, with a sudden lurch, he found himself being dragged back along the tunnel.Just as suddenly it stopped, and Toni scrambled forwards and hooked his arm into the tunnels curve.Moving quickly, he dipped his body downwards in a desperate dive, promptly slamming the top of his helmet against the bottom.Slapping his hands about frantically, Toni found that the tunnel goosenecked, and he followed it up and out of the water.It was dark on the other side.Feeling another hard yank on his leg, Toni threw himself forwards and fell headfirst into the second gooseneck beyond.He quickly cornered the obstacle and clawed his way out the other side and into unexpected light.The old sergeant pulled him out of the tubes opposite end and dropped him dripping onto the tent floor.As Toni gaped in confusion at his surroundings, a medic subjected him to a cursory health check.Thirty seconds!the sergeant stated gruffly as he glanced at a stopwatch, just as Toni realized that he was inside a closed tent.He was puzzled as to how he could have completed the course in only thirty seconds, but the thought was interrupted by a resounding horn that almost shook the tent down.All three clapped their hands to their ears.Fuck hell!Jorren, twenty seconds!Toni blinked stupidly as the orderly put a knee to the ground and looked into his eyes.Son, do you wish to continue?he asked.Toni couldnt work his mouth, so he nodded instead.Ten seconds!Jorren, get the rope off the boy!The orderly released the rope that had been hooked to Tonis trouser leg and gave it three hard yanks.After a pause the rope slipped back down the tube.How long has it been?Toni gasped, his mind numb as he struggled to stand.Three ...two ...one ...go!the sergeant shouted, giving him a smack in the back hard enough to send him flying out the tent.Youre five minutes in, boy!the orderly shouted as Toni departed.A much younger sergeant stood before him.Grabbing a hold of the newcomers arm, he lifted a finger before Tonis nose.Im gonna say this only once, so listen good!Youve done the fear obstacles.Nice job.From here on out its all resistance.Keep your pace up but dont kill yourself.You stop running only when they tell you to stop.Understood?Yeah ...Toni breathed.The sergeant then pointed beyond Toni towards the triple palisade beyond.The Clicks second part was a cinch for Toni.Growing up on a farm with a lot of trees and fences about had its privileges.If he hadnt already been dead tired from the first part, he might even have enjoyed it.There were palisades, rope swings, trenches, successively taller Chinese gateways, over unders, a whole assortment of obstacles, variations on obstacles, and combinations of obstacles to overcome.The rain had even let up a bit, although every surface was still wet and treacherous.The resistance course accompanied a waterline that snaked around a low hill.Beyond the waterline he found some spectators, all clad in varying shades of green, grey, and mud brown uniforms, some shouting words of encouragement while others spewed verbal abuse at his passage.Shortly afterwards a much recovered Toni was making his way around the hills opposite end, when he saw before him what was almost certainly the final obstacle.A rippling black wall twenty paces wide and thirty tall stood with an obscene slit at its center, accessible only by a scaffold foot ramp that began shortly beyond the end of the second to last obstacle.A horde of spectators was visible on both sides of the wall, and all were silent for the moment.All fear Toni might have had was smothered by his relief at the sight of the finish line.Overcoming a confusing array of low lying wires, he hit the ramp at a steady jog and held the pace as he ascended.Someone off to his left began to shout on a loudspeaker.JUMP!JUMP!JUMP!The spectators took up the cry.As Toni peered up at the wall itself, he noticed that it was apparently made of the same flexible polymer he had dealt with minutes ago.He made out three words in a semi circle above the slit.ONE GIANT LEAP  His last task was apparently a simple one.Closing in on the gate as the shouting reached a crescendo, Toni held his breath, crossed his forearms over his chest and leapt with legs locked together through the slit.For the briefest of moments, he caught sight of something impossibly large moving impossibly fast and, from the corner of his eye, a blur moving towards him like a freight train.I die now, his mind ejaculated.The freight train struck Toni, hammering him so hard that the heavens burst before his eyes.The deafening smack resounded in his ears as he was launched sideways, doing a gradual half turn as he glided through the air.He had briefly relieved himself while in the watery tunnel, believing there would be no more appropriate location than there to do so.What little hadnt come out before did now.One brief, terrified squirt.Tonis landing was, contrary to all else that had happened to him, unbelievably soft.Landing up side down, his hands instinctively clawed at the ascending net of nano wire that had broken his fall, the net giving way several meters beneath and beyond him.He lay there for a moment, barely registering the raucous cheers from his audience, until a heart stopping roar tore into his ears, banishing all emotions except terror from his mind.Toni turned onto his back and laid his eyes upon the armored Suit.It stood before him, grey as granite, segmented in body and headless, holding a gigantic shock yellow padded sledgehammer in a double handed grip.Moving with unexpected fluidity, it swung the sledgehammer in an uppercut against the bottom of the nano net he was lying on.The ripple propagated upwards, flipping Toni right side up and forcing him to twist around once more to keep his eyeballs on the colossus.CLIMB!CLIMB!CLIMB!the man with the loudspeaker began to chant, and the cry was soon taken up by the spectators.Moving with silence and agility, the Suit dropped the sledgehammer into the churned mud below and gripped the bottom end of the nano net.The titan then shook the net in a parody of spreading a bed sheet and the wave rippled upwards, forcing the recruit to hold on for fear of sliding down into the mud.Toni took the hint and began to scramble up the net, ascending quickly despite the Suits occasional shaking and bullying.His shoulders and thighs began to burn fiercely with the effort, but gradually the voices below became fainter and fainter.The nets width varied widely but was never less than twenty paces across, and it kept a roughly thirty degree angle due to having been fixed to nearby trees with nano wire cables.Finally breathless, his heart beating a heavy staccato rhythm inside his chest, Toni began to hear encouraging shouts from above, and he paused momentarily to rest and scrutinize the source of the noise.Above him, set between four massive redwoods, was an army encampment.Viewed from below, it appeared to be an enormous hovering square of about forty paces across and canopied with an olive green awning, and there was a line of desks to either side of a narrow entryway.At the entryway, an assortment of uniformed men and women applauded and shouted words of support down to him.Encouraged but uncertain, he began to ascend once more, the more suspicious facet of his personality fearing that they would fall upon him with clubs at his arrival.In the last couple of meters the nets angle suddenly steepened, but then a multitude of hands grabbed him by his anti trauma padding and hoisted him onto the plastic flagstones.Toni felt relieved at having already puked out the contents of his stomach, but still he dry heaved a few times as someone annoyingly patted his back.Would you believe it?!The first recruit made it through!We must have done something wrong!a matronly woman announced loudly to the crowds laughter.Corporal, take the rook out back and see if you can put him back together, a deep voice spoke, and he was gingerly lifted into the arms of a burly soldier with red stripes so old they had faded to pink.Toni stared belatedly at his muddied thighs as he was easily carried by the soldier, and then he was set down against a line of crates acting as improvised railing for the camps perimeter.Who would have thought, a Corpie carrying a rook around like he was a baby ...the corporal drawled in his deep voice.He didnt sound altogether as offended as the words implied.Thank you ...Dont mention it.Im Baylen.The corporal thumbed at the nametag on his broad chest where, sure enough, his name was neatly printed along with his blood type.They shook hands briefly, Tonis fingers receiving a surprising gentle squeeze from his beefy shaker.The recruit quietly observed his surroundings.Most of the camps population was still at the Clicks finishing line, and a solitary soldier manned a laptop at a desk to their left.To say it was windy up there would have been an understatement.This place is something else ...Yeah, welcome to Valhalla Command, that heavenly place all true warriors ascend to after getting plastered by a Suit.Or something like that.You just sit there for a few mikes and take small sips from this bottle here, and Ill return once your breath is back to get you stretching.You stink, by the way ...he added, chuckling as he returned to the crowd.Toni sat on the tiles alone for some time, keeping his eyes closed as his body slowly recovered, only his ears remaining attentive to their surroundings.Valhalla camps awning was set at its lowest point to the rear, and a continuous cascade of rainwater drained off behind him and downwards to the forest floor.After a while he noticed that he was wrapped in a thick grey blanket, and wondered when that had happened.
