Then the Suit detonated in crimson flames, the fireball expanding quickly to envelope the surrounding trees.The enemy Suit appeared from the forest unscathed to calmly survey the carnage.Toni made ready to engage, but the Suit immediately noticed the Moca and turned its rifle to towards him.A powerful blast suddenly lifted the hostile Suit off its footpads, engulfing the Unmil in a miniature mushroom cloud before gravity pulled it back to earth.It struck the ground on its back, the impact causing the leaf less trees surrounding it to shake as if they had suddenly come to life.The detonation appeared to have originated from the Hammerheads discarded object.Toni took advantage.Activating all armament, he opened fire on the Unmil simultaneously with rocket pods and rifle.The sound of all systems firing at once rang him like a bell, the sight of the impacts against the hostile Suits chassis making the agony worthwhile.Quickly he changed clips and prepared to reengage.A brilliant flash from the Unmils upraised rifle coincided with the complete disintegration of Unit Sevens right appendage.PAMs popped as the Suit rolled to its left, and Toni hastily decided it was time to become scarce.He rolled out of the depression and began to wind among the trees as fast as his one armed Suit could carry him, glancing back occasionally to see whether he was being followed.Seeing nothing, he decided not to risk it and took advantage of the long descent to pick up speed.A tree behind him suddenly exploded into splinters, followed by another a moment later.Giving his dancing compass a cursory look, he took a westish course and prepared to go aerobic.A full minute later, Tonis APU was running to an ever louder clattering sound and a burning smell began to intrude upon the interface cavity.His dismayed oculars were staring at the open hatch, watching as diffuse smoke billowed from its interior, when a tree close behind suddenly exploded into splinters.The laser beam burned its way through the wood and struck the fugitive unit below its pressure vessel, where its APU was situated.The impact sent Unit Seven rolling down the hill, colliding hard enough against trees to uproot one and spilling four hundred liters of Resinin oil over the landscape.Toni collided twice against the cavitys interior wall, and he mentally thanked Ruka for the padding shed thought to fit there.Taking advantage of his momentum, he rolled himself back onto his feet and took off at a sprint, his lungs beginning to burn on par with his legs.Strangely enough, Toni suddenly found it much easier to run, and before long he accelerated to a pace beyond anything he had thought possible for a Moca.He managed the following hill so fast that only the occasional tree strike was enough to reduce speeds to their original level.Two minutes later he took the moment to read the accumulating warning messages on his display.The information was like a blade through his heart:   WARNING: APU PURGED   WARNING: FUEL TANK RUPTURED   WARNING: ACAT AT 50 PERCENT CAPACITY  Somehow he had managed to lose his APU and empty his biofuel deposit in his rolling descent.And he had five minutes worth of locomotion, at best, before he ran out of air entirely.The cause behind his sudden increase in performance was no doubt due to the loss of so much weight.Running flat out, he made for a forest island and then adjusted his trajectory to home in on the axis of retreat displayed on his map.The islands were much hardier terrain than the plantation land, probably the reason why they had managed to remain forests in the first place, and that suited him fine; with more landscape to hide behind, agility, not peak speed, became the primary factor for survival.As Unit Seven came out onto an open area on the islands opposite side, a laser beam struck its titanium skull, disintegrating it and sending his Suit rolling down what remained of the high ground.Entirely blind, Toni fell into a ravine at the end of the decline, landing on his right side to the sound of a loud snap just before his body double slammed against the cavitys wall.The OS automatically activated the Crab Eye system, the pair of wing like accessories with compact oculars at their ends unfolding elegantly from the torsos summit.Picking himself up, Toni turned and bounded unsteadily down the ravine with an intense hissing sound coming from below his midsection.Water vapor began to condense around the Suits waist area as cool air bled out, both denouncing his presence to any potential pursuant and warning him that its hollow hipbone had probably been damaged.The ravine was dangerously straight and bare, and he was fortunate in finding a collapsed bank only moments after his fall.He decided to move parallel to the axis of retreat, suspecting that the enemy armored Suit had placed itself between him and his escape route.Once again Toni found it easier to move, and he realized that the pressure build up in the Suits hollow bones and external tank had probably been slowly decreasing the PAMs ability to expel air, a problem inadvertently resolved by the sudden pressure loss from the break.He continued onwards desperately, hoping that somehow the Unmil had give up on him.His hope proved to be optimistic.As Unit Seven intruded unexpectedly upon the edge of a wide clearing, the Suits lower appendages exploded underneath it, the legless torso plowing into the ground with a tremendous crash before it came rolling to a halt.The dying Suit dug its only remaining gauntlet into the ground and rolled away from the clearing.It kept on rolling, the open hatch scooping up so much earth with every turn that the cavity was becoming akin to a concrete mixer, soiling Tonis injuries in the process.Keeping his mouth closed, holding his breath and then holding it again when his loose travel pack smacked against his body, Toni finally came to rest inside a shallow dip in the terrain.Raw terror, never too far away, made an opportunistic stab for the limelight.For a while Toni was unable to move or even think; his eyes, however, were already occupying themselves with his surroundings.He lay in a natural bowl three meters deep by about twenty wide, likely the topographical dimple resulting from a cave collapse.The trees surrounding it were widely spaced but very broad.The ground was soft and moist.Tonis mind slowly began to function again.He weighed his options carefully; he could stay and fight and die.He could stay and surrender.He could abandon his Suit and try and escape on foot.Option three appeared by far the most attractive of the lot.Suspecting that he wouldnt have much time to effect an escape, he tried to look around, only to be reminded that he no longer had any head to swivel.A sound at the edge of his hearing then caused him to freeze and listen very carefully.Picking up nothing but suspecting every sound, he slowly came to terms with the fact that the Unmil Suit was hunting him.An idea of the desperate kind came to him.He popped off his twenty four flares all at once, and they shot off banging and hissing every which way.Supporting himself on his remaining arm, he lifted his torso up awkwardly, looking west where it seemed likely that the enemy unit would have placed itself.Only its movement gave the Suit away.The hostile was less than fifty meters off, quite difficult to see due to the quality of the Mocas auxiliary oculars.Toni threw himself onto his back with a shudder and then tried to fire over the depressions lip with his rifle.The first burst hit the ground nearby, the explosive rounds peppering his Suit with tungsten carbide spheres in the process.He fired higher and managed to get a second burst over the lip.Then his only remaining appendage disintegrated all the way up to its elbow and the spinning rifle hammered into the ground nearby.Deactivate suit!Toni roared.Finding it very hard to extricate himself from the interface with only one functioning arm, he finally shrugged his way out through the exposed right side, pulled the pen key out from its slot and bolted for the cavitys access panel.He reached for his sidearm and put it away in a pouch on his vest, shouldering the Lacrau firmly as soon as hed hooked the strap to a pad eye on his shoulder.Carefully, he approached the hatch and peered outside.From its full height of ten meters, the enemy armored Suit peered down at him, its chassis showing more damage than he had noticed from a distance.Toni moved out of sight, thinking hard.A sudden impact projected him against the cavity wall and he struck the HINTs maintenance panel hard with his unprotected head.Blacking out momentarily, he returned to consciousness with what remained of his Suit still rocking from the kick it had just received.Toni strode beyond fear and into the land of hate.Finding his helmet beneath a pile of rubble, he strapped it on firmly and kept out of the enemy Suits sight, hoping that the driver would somehow be foolish enough to exit his unit.Another violent shudder shook the Moca, and Toni began to feel his gut sinking as the entire chassis was lifted off the ground.He grimly prepared himself for the end of his life.Instead the entire cavity shook and shuddered and turned, and the accumulated cargo in the interface cavity began to pour out of the hatch.Feeling once again as if he were inside a concrete mixer, Toni held on as best as he could to the wiring surrounding him, finding himself being shaken almost beyond the resilience of his flesh as rock, dirt, vegetation, what remained of his first aid kit and his travel pack were ejected into the world beyond.After several frustrated shakes that Toni barely managed to resist, the enemy driver disgustedly released the chassis, and the remains of Unit Seven collided hard against the soil.Toni took the impact against his right side and screamed in pain, far beyond caring about his fate anymore.A pair of intense strobes suddenly filled his field of vision, making him suspect that he was on the verge of passing out.A moment later, Toni felt more than heard a heavy impact that shook the ground beneath the wreck.Silently he waited, trying to grasp what was happening.An immense shock wave suddenly struck the area with enough force to lay the chassis out on its side and strip the leaves from their trees, leaving the foliage to fall to the ground like confetti.A second shock wave then washed over the tormented land, threatening to turn the Mocas remains over entirely.Enough was enough; a bloody and butchered Toni abandoned his unit for the last time.He came out into the open with the Lacrau hanging impotently from its strap, a multitude of leaves still falling upon his skewed helmet as he stared agawk at his surroundings.To his south west and no more than a couple of kilometers from where he stood, two great mushroom clouds rose majestically from the ground, presiding over their immediate territory like twin gods fallen from the skies.Toni could see them clearly because every tree around him was stripped of its foliage, allowing him also to observe vast forest fires from south to south east.And the goliath that only moments ago had been trying to shake him out of his Suit like a mouse from an empty can of beans was lying motionless on its back, almost perfectly camouflaged by the fallen leaves.Hugging his middle, Toni plodded miserably towards his badly beaten travel pack, still reeling from the trauma and sick with the thought of returning to an interface cavity any time soon.He reached his pack only to vomit beside it, the effort of the act causing him to black out once more.He slowly regained consciousness to a persistent hammering noise.Suddenly there was another sound, much like something giving way.Sheisse!Toni turned towards the source of the sound.Unable to move, he watched as a mans torso protruded from an opening in the flank of the enemy units breastplate.The man was dirty blonde and rugged in appearance, and clothed in what looked like a black bodysuit.And he was armed with a sleek rifle, which he promptly raised towards the injured driver.Toni acted due more to a sudden spark of rage than to fear.Gripping the Lacrau with a slap of his hand, he fired a short burst at the driver, striking him several times.The remaining shots veered away as the rifle danced in his hand and the enemy driver disappeared quickly into his unit.The driver began to laugh from inside the colossus, a genuine laugh that seemed alien to the circumstances.The laughter was followed by several words that Toni failed to understand, and then by a hand  grenade that flew out the hatch towards him.Toni instinctively sheltered behind his travel pack, and the following concussion promptly riddled it with shrapnel.Both soldiers rose from their shelters simultaneously, Lacrau eight millimeter projectiles crossing paths with sub caliber two millimeter flechettes in a hailstorm of gunfire.Toni was struck twice in his vest and once under his right armpit, hardly feeling the impacts as he watched some of his own strike home.A second grenade detonated nearby, how it had arrived there quite beyond Tonis understanding.His already injured arm took a fragment and a second one thwacked against his helmet.Taking shelter again, Toni began to get the distinct impression he was losing the fight.Further laughter from the enemy driver only served to add weight to the thought.Desperately he unpocketed a grenade and pulled out the arming pin with the hook on his vest, giving the hatch a split second glimpse before he lobbed the device.As the grenade left his hand, a moving shadow near the giants armpit caught his attention.The shadow catapulted over the units arm, rolled over the depressions lip and disappeared from sight just as the hatch swallowed the grenade.He bolted after the driver, his mind too numb to think about leaving the depression from a safer side.As he approached the lip, several impacts against his upper vest felled him, the gradient rolling him back until he was beside the Unmil Suit.He barely had time to notice that the hatch had somehow sealed itself when the enemy units torso ruptured with a thunderous thump, much of the overpressure inside being relieved by what looked to be explosion vents between the giants neck and pauldrons.Rising unsteadily to his feet, Toni released his rifle to hang at his chest, produced a second grenade and pulled its pin.A part of his brain was having a hard time deciding whether it was currently in command of a human body or an armored Suit, but he shoved the thought aside and instead released the safety lever, lobbing the grenade outwards at a high angle.Three seconds later a blast shook the area, followed by the static like sound of shrapnel impacting wood at ever greater distances.Throwing himself forward as if breaching an invisible force field, Toni bounded up and over the lip, picking up as much speed as his ailing body would allow.Grunting in pain and effort, he searched for his quarry.A fleeing figure slalomed among the denuded trees.He set off in pursuit with another grenade firmly held in his hand, his rifle tucked snugly into the crevice between his vest and his badly bleeding arm.He did not need to pursue for long.A grenade, surreptitiously dropped by the escaping driver, detonated twenty paces ahead of Toni, drumming shrapnel into the trees before and beside him.Not daring to slacken his pace, Toni deviated left to follow a more parallel trajectory.Despite his bleeding wounds, his burning muscles and lungs and the weight of his equipment, he found himself closing the distance quickly.Soon he was thirty paces away and beginning to suspect that the slowdown was deliberate, but then the fugitive collapsed into the ground and lay there motionless, his only sounds a deep, unhealthy wheezing.Pocketing his grenade, Toni approached carefully, aiming the Lacrau at the back of the soldiers head.Throw the weapon aside!NOW!he demanded, his suspicion deep despite the soldiers unhesitating obedience.On your back!he ordered.Very slowly, the enemy driver obliged.He was older than he looked from a distance, his handsome face finely lined by time.Despite his wheezing, the soldier wore a wide grin on his face, perhaps more akin to a grimace.As Toni stared at his eyes, those intelligent grey eyes, they stared back at him measuringly.The soldier spoke.Yes yes, kinder.You are a very persistent boy.You have captured me.Well done!Now you must show me   You killed my friend ...Toni interrupted.The mans grin faded to a forced smile.He insisted.That is unfortunate, but this is war   Toni fired a burst into his gut, the soldiers body wiggling spastically as the rounds connected.The object of his rage turned to the side and let off a long, choked groan, his perspiring face flushing red as the he momentarily ceased to breathe.On your back!Toni demanded, kicking the man viciously as soon as it became clear he wasnt obeying.Eventually the soldier did obey and lay gingerly on his back, his renewed breathing shallow and difficult.There was no longer a smile on his face.Instead the soldier looked sullen, almost sulky, and he held his hands high beside his head.The bodysuit appeared almost unchanged except for some stretch marks in the fabric.That fascinated Toni enough for him to consider repeating the act, but the soldier read his thoughts easily.Nein, Nein, kinder!The textile is special, see?If you press slowly it bends easily, but the harder you strike it, the harder it gets.That is all, that is all it is  The soldier began to wheeze again, the act of speaking having apparently exhausted him.Toni fired another burst into his midsection and then the electrical firing pin arced across empty air.Hastily he reloaded, a task not aided in the least by his onehandedness.He cursed at his own stupidity; if the soldier had not been rolling in the leaves crying, he would have been fighting a two handed adversary for his life.He noticed the man watching him from the corner of his eye, tears of pain still coursing from it.There was pain to be seen there but, more importantly, there was a barely concealed coldness that he hadnt seen before.For a moment Toni imagined having to imprison someone as smart and cold blooded as lieutenant Templeton while having use of only one good arm.The thought helped him to make the decision.He pointed his rifle at the soldiers head, committed to what he needed to do.The soldier rolled slowly onto his back, the cold expression replaced by a very cautious one.He spoke again.I am sorry, kinder.I have been a soldier for too long and sometimes I forget how deeply young fighters feel a loss.I am your prisoner, as certainly as you would have been mine if I had caught you.I would have honored you as a prisoner, and you will honor me as one too, yes?Carefully he turned over onto his stomach, placing his hands behind his back, wrists side by side.And then he waited quietly.FOURTEEN      Mining quadrant, 09H32, 14th of June, 2771      The psychotic teenager pushed the rifles muzzle against the back of Kaisers head, making it very clear that he was unsatisfied with his prisoners marching speed.Unwillingly he hastened his pace, bloodshot eyes darting at his surroundings every few moments in expectation of a rescuing Harrowers appearance.The Bavarian was having difficulty keeping from laughing out loud at his predicament, still not fully believing he had just been defeated in combat with the aid of his own commanders.That would make it only the second time he had lost a Suit, although on Mars he had still managed to return safely to friendly lines.And last time he hadnt sacrificed a quarter of their combat strength in the course of his defeat.Laughing out loud was certainly not a thing to do with this boy, however.Once the youth had bound him with his bandoleer, Kaiser had made the mistake of smiling up at him; the result had been a rifle butt to the skull with enough force to knock him out cold.Once he had regained consciousness, he had found the boy squatting over him with a well used pocketknife in his hand.Not the most promising of developments.It was the look in his eyes that had worried Kaiser; the boy appeared to be slipping into a dark, ugly place.Oh, so you are alive ...And that had been the last time the boy had spoken to him.From that moment onwards, Kaiser had opted in favor of complete cooperation as his surest survival strategy, not feeling confident enough to have to wrestle him, bad wing or no.The root source of his lack of self confidence stemmed from the fact that Kaiser was also a quite impressed with his captor.Already, the red suns merciless rays were murdering his own skin, and the gravity sucked the energy out of his body with every step he took.He was also certain that the carbon dioxide that had almost asphyxiated him during his attempted escape would certainly do the same if he were to try again.Yet despite the slim pilot having suffered enough damage to drop a special ops trooper, he had still managed to course the uneven terrain like a gazelle in the course of the foot pursuit.More impressively, the boy seemed completely oblivious to the suns effects as he loped along, his bandaged arm regularly dripping blood, carrying that enormous mutilated backpack of his with remarkably little effort.Perhaps it was the reddish light, but his eyes were a strange golden color he had only ever seen in the more engineered canine breeds.His captor was probably far more adapted to that planet than he was, which meant there were only three ways he would be able to secure his freedom: outside assistance, subtle deception or dumb luck.Kinder, it would be unwise for us to keep approaching those clouds.Surely you know what radioactivity is, no?he spoke over his shoulder, slackening his pace.The boys answer was simply another jab at his skull.Kaiser picked up his pace again, thinking hard.The quickly dissipating mushroom clouds were of no concern to him, of course, the aneutronic fusion devices that had birthed them having been designed to minimize fallout.Indeed he was probably at greater risk from his mobile Suits continuous low level radioactivity than from what he was seeing up ahead.But Kaiser would be hard put to work his magic if the boy were to somehow hook up with his comrades in arms.He stared ahead, cursing those clouds and the cowards who had chosen to put them there.If his Suit had been in good working order, a nearby thermonuclear event would have been of no consequence to him; like all front line equipment and armament, the Harrowers had been hardened against electromagnetic pulses of nuke origin or otherwise.The problem was that the electronics itself was far too sensitive to be impervious to such interference, which was why EMP hardening depended almost exclusively on the set of faraday cages that encased the sensitive parts of his Suit.He refused to believe the impacts against his unit had breached the CPUs robust encasement itself.But the CPU was connected by cable to other sensitive components, and any failure to those cages, or to any of the armored cables themselves, would probably have been enough to compromise the entire system.Considering the intense magnetic fields inherent to charge separation type EMPs, the collection of circuit breakers protecting the CPU would simply not have been able to open fast enough once cage integrity was spoiled.But the nukes hadnt destroyed the Suit.Kaiser had.Or to be more exact, Kaiser had neglected to close the hatch after exiting his Suit, hoping that the boy would simply presume he was still sheltering inside.And then he had made it worse by sealing the uncompromised hatch by remote in the hope of retrieving the platform later.How was he to know that the boy had tossed a grenade inside?A smile twitched at the corners of his mouth, and he wondered whether his captor knew just how much disruption he had caused to their plans.They eventually intruded on the outskirts of the nearest site.The tactical nuke had detonated over a broad valley, setting fire to an area three hundred meters wide and uprooting all but the strongest trees for more than half a kilometer.As they moved into the clearing of upturned trees, the wind blowing strongly against their backs and towards the inferno, his captor motioned for him to stop.Grateful for the pause, Kaiser sat with his back against a fallen tree, breathing fast and shallow as perspiration dripped from his nose and chin.Sitting on an unearthed root, the boy stared expressionlessly at the forest fire as if mesmerized by its flames.Despite his agony, a couple of quips jumped into Kaisers mind, but he decided to remain silent instead.The events had taken a heavy toll on the pilot.It was never wise to poke at a wounded creature, and this one was certainly wounded in more ways than one.Slowly but surely, the fire began to close the distance towards them.Who are you?Kaiser turned towards the boy.Hello, how do you do?I am Kaiser.I dont give a shit for your name, asshole.Who are you?Ah.I am Major Tommi Von Beulwitz, Mobile Suit commander of the Earth Federation Forces.The boy stared at him for a long while.Soon the increasing warmth to the side of Kaisers face was warning him of the encroaching danger.If I may, kinder, I would advise we not remain here much longer.My name is not kinder!Youll be calling me Sergeant Muira from now on.Ill make this very clear: If you try to escape, disobey or generally piss me off, Ill snuff you out, whatever your rank.On your feet.They skirted the forest fire by moving south, weaving their way with difficulty among the collapsed plantation trees due to the angle at which they had fallen.Gradually the terrains inclination began to steepen and before long Kaiser began to have difficulties.After several pushes and one violent shove, Kaiser realized he needed to be more obvious about his breathing difficulties.He collapsed to the ground and began to hyperventilate.Get up!Miura ordered.Kaiser tucked his chin in defensively as the boy made ready with his rifle butt.Please, Sergeant, I need only a moment  this air is poison to me, verdammte!he shouted just as the butt collided against his skull.He had already been suffering from tunnel vision.Double vision arrived and then he finally blacked out.By the time he returned to a world swimming in starbursts, the boy was staring at him speculatively.Poison?he repeated.Yes, boy ...Sergeant, I mean.Poison.Youre a natural?Kaiser disliked the way in which the boy had said the word, and he made an effort to find an acceptable answer, his numbed mind struggling to think.Oh, no I am not.But I am not adapted to the air of this planet as you certainly are.Then youre a natural.Nein, nein.I am not, I tell you!I am genetically engineered like you are, except to be a better mobile Suit pilot!he insisted, disliking where the conversation was headed.Then youre a natural!the boy repeated.You werent made for this world, but only to be a Suit driver.Your Suit is your world, then, not Capicua.What are you doing here?he demanded.The boys words shocked Kaiser more than he would ever dare admit.The very thought had passed through his mind in his darker moments, although he had never dared put it into words, not even to Lippard, with whom he could be so candid about so many things.Carefully he put it all out of his mind, along with the fleeting thought of Lippard.He prepared to gamble.I am your enemy.Your enemy in this world.The whole universe is filled with mankind, and there are many planets out there where men forget they are a part of something larger, greater.And I am only one among many who have come to remind you planetary retrogrades of precisely that.You are not some indigenous species of this world.You are only one outreaching hand of mankind.Sorry Major, but Earth is very, very far away, and Im not gonna get into a debate about who belongs where.The plain fact is you pissed off the wrong people when you attacked Leiben.Lieben?Leiben!The city you dropped a few of those on, remember?The boy gestured angrily towards the black clouds persisting over the valley.Ah, my apologies, then.I did not agree with that decision.There are better ways to greet the locals, I said.You must understand there are many on my side who get nervous when they see so much armament skirting a city like that.But please do not forget we are here to pacify you   Kaiser was expecting what came next, having spent the previous minutes working to loosen the bandoleer that bound his arms.The sergeant kicked out viciously and his boot connected with his captives head.Taking advantage, Kaiser caught the boot with his newly untied hands as it retracted, knowing that the boys legs were strong enough to help him up in the process.Twisting around so his back collided against his adversarys slung arm, he hugged the rifle with both arms and sprung upwards, rolling in mid air over his shoulder as he did so.The weapon twisted into his hands more easily than he would have dared hope, but then his back collided hard against the uneven ground.It was somewhat more difficult to perform such acrobatics under the intense gravity of that planet.Before a split second had passed, the young sergeants elbow came crashing down on his face, breaking his nose.Eyes watering badly, Kaiser felt his adversary shake the weapon out of his grasp.One deafening gunshot later, Kaiser was cradling the side of his face where a projectile had torn a ragged path.Cursing his idiocy, he waited for the finishing shot.Instead the seconds kept ticking by, and as Kaiser began to wipe the tears from his eyes there was a second shot from a distance away.It was not an echo.The young sergeants strange eyes became wide and hopeful as he searched the summit, rifle still trained on his prisoner.Up!Now!he ordered, having apparently forgotten that they had been fighting only moments before.Kaiser obeyed, cradling his face as blood dripped through his fingers.He renewed his ascent, crossing what remained of the jumbled landscape until they reached the summit of the hill.On the opposing side, they came upon a second Harrower, lying on its side amidst a carpet of fallen leaves.Tonesy!Over here, mate!Kaiser heard to his dismay.Standing beside the giant like victorious Lilliputians, several locals were gathered.One of them crossed the distance at a run, a tall and lean fellow with wild hair a little too long to be allowed.By the way they greeted one another it was clear they were friends.This guys an Unmil.Hes from Earth, Miura said after a moment of shoulder slapping, gesturing to Kaiser with a wave of his hand.The local approached and stared at him with an unfriendly expression.Kaiser decided to make a good impression.Hello there, kinder.I am Kai UMPH!Without warning, the local had buried a boot into his gut, putting enough force into it to rupture something were it not for the shock absorbing qualities of his suit.Kaisers legs gave in and his knees hit the hard ground percussively as pain radiated from his abdomen.Fucking sadist, he cursed silently.The pair apparently had that much in common.An explosive laugh left his lips before his lungs seized on him.Now this doesnt make any sense!You gotta see the one weve caught, hell blow your mind ...They half escorted, half dragged him towards the remainder of the group.There he found three equally young locals standing near the Harrowers helm, two of them women, and a fourth person sitting cross legged on the ground amongst them.It was Deadhand.As Kaiser was made to sit down, he evaluated the state of his subordinate, and was appalled by what he saw; Deadhand had taken a beating against which his own injuries paled by comparison.His ebony face had ballooned, especially around the eyes, and his lips were torn and uneven.His skull appeared to have been scraped over by a blade several times, leaving him almost scalped.The same blade had probably been used to gouge at the side of his muscular neck, having probably stopped short of his carotid by mere millimeters.His right ear was only half attached, and it protruded from the side of his head as if it had been viciously yanked at.Kaiser raised his eyebrows questioningly.The African simply shook his head, his battered face too deformed for the Bavarian to be able to read the expression there.The excited conversation among the locals died down as the Miura boy squatted to take a good look at the other prisoner.He kept the stare up for quite a while.Whats wrong with him?he asked to no one in particular.Thats his natural color, he calls himself a colored man!Think hes an African like in the books?No, thats not what I meant ...I mean, how did this happen to him?The friend became fidgety, and one of the women replied instead, her eyes an impossibly light shade of blue.Ray lost it when we got a hold of him.Our Suits collapsed close together as Davos here was about to kill us.The sarge died trying to defend us ...Jorrens dead?Yes.The driver killed him when this was still a battle with Suits.Then the nuke detonated, and we managed to reach Davos as he was trying to get out of his hatch.He wasnt armed but he attacked Ray anyway.And Ray lost it ...Lost it, my ass ...Ray interrupted hotly, blood vessels protruding from his neck, It was self defense!Not a problem, Ray ...Miura said calmly.I was just curious as to how it happened ...Wheres the rest of your section?the third boy, a sullen blonde, asked.Hirums dead.The rest evacuated while I was trying to pull him out.Hirum was done in by Kaiser here.The group turned towards him, as if seeing him anew.Alarm bells began to ring in Kaisers head.As usual, his instincts were right on the mark.You sonufa ...BITCH!Ray screamed, launching himself towards the prisoner before anyone could stop him.Ray kicked Kaiser hard and the Bavarians back smacked against the dirt.The local straddled his chest and pulled a knife from his vest, but before he could make any use of the weapon, his arm was expertly gripped by the blonde boy, the remaining soldiers wrenching the knife from his grip.Ray began to howl in rage and nearly managed to shake them off, but before long both of his wrists found themselves in a firm lock.Ian, dont hurt him, youll only make it worse!the pale eyed girl shouted as she struggled to hold on.Gradually the soldier began to calm down, but suddenly a scuffle broke out between Miura and the blonde boy.You trying to bind your own mate?!Get your hands off him!Miura roared.Thats enough, you two!No ones going to bind anyone.Right, Ian?Yeah ...thats right.And when he loses it again, you can hold him down yourself, Tonesy.Hes freaking out and hes not going to calm down until the patch wears off.Miura touched something behind his ear, a fleeting act that nevertheless alarmed the pale eyed girl.Dont take it off, youll stroke out!He removed his hand as if hed just received an electric shock, nodding instead to her in thanks.Turning to Ray, he spoke reassuringly.Listen, Ray.Weve managed to capture these two alive, right?And my prisoner here, Major whats his name, has already told me that our enemy is the Earth Federation Forces, and that theyre here to annex us to Earths authority, or something along those lines.They can tell us a lot more, too, but we gotta get them back to friendly forces, right?And that gets a little difficult if they cant walk for themselves ...You need to lay off the kindness, OK?Their shocked expressions at his revelation were not entirely unexpected.What was unexpected was the one that momentarily played across the blonde soldiers face before he smothered it.Kaiser was an expert at reading micro expressions; he quickly tucked the information away in a corner of his mind for future use.He then noticed that Deadhand was staring at him with raised eyebrows.So were allowed to pass on intelligence to the locals now, Major?he whispered.Do not worry yourself, my friend.In due time these children will be dealt with.There is dissension among them, as you may have noticed, he whispered back, marveling at how easily they were able to hold that conversation as the soldiers talked excitedly among themselves.Toni, who patched up your arm?Pale eyes asked.I did, I guess ...Sueli, Im taking your kit, if you dont mind.I have feeling Ill need more than mine to treat that.They settled in comfortably beside the felled Harrower, no one seeming to realize that Ebony Towers first objective would be to locate their fallen combat assets.Kaiser blessed them for their ignorance.Miura and the young woman removed the bandages from his arm and gasped at the level of tissue damage.Even Kaiser felt his stomach go queasy at the sight; the triceps muscle above his elbow was deeply torn, a ragged layer of yellow fat on display there.His brachial artery or some ramification thereof had probably been affected, and the wound began to bleed again as soon as the bottom most bandage was removed.The entire remainder of his arm was heavily cratered.A jagged bone poked out from a wound on his forearm.The break looks clean enough ...Pale eyes remarked, a smile playing on her face.A moment later she became somber.We need to align the bone.If we can, I mean.Im not sure if there are any fragments in the way.Well have to clean the wounds first, of course.Toni?What is it, Hannah?This is going to hurt like a mouse in a blender.Im going to spike you with flupirtine first, of course, but youre still gonna have to help me here.You too, Ray.They set to work on Miura and before long Kaiser was hearing howls of pain as they attempted to reset the bone.The Hannah girl was caring but relentless as she worked, and he found himself beginning to respect her.The other girl was a little too pretty for such a place, as if someone in the human resources department had screwed up and yanked her from Public Relations.She kept her composure well enough, though, despite clearly preferring to keep her distance from Hannahs gory first aid efforts.The blonde, however, had been behaving oddly since his discovery of Kaisers provenance.He appeared quite determined to avoid eye contact with him, but there was neither fear nor hostility in his demeanor, only a guarded expression.As with all odd things, his interest was piqued, and he filed that information away for future exploitation.As the hours passed and the group prepared to move, there was still no sign of EFF activity.To Kaisers chagrin, no Suit, no infantry force, not even a lousy drone dared make an appearance in the area.Leaning over to a newly bandaged Deadhand, he whispered softly.Are you up to some delaying action, my friend?Anytime, Commander.What kind of action we talking about?The playing mostly dead kind.I need you to lie down and close your eyes as if you are unconscious.We must make time for the Tower to find us.Ill take care of the explanations.Understood?Deadhands reply was to lean into the ground and slowly close his eyes.Kaiser smiled inwardly, thanking the pilot for his courage.His thoughts were interrupted by a shout from Miura.Ian, what in hell did you just do?The blonde haired boy had just returned from the trees to their west, where several plumes of smoke were rising from the trees there.Dont have a miscarriage, Tonesy.As the senior sergeant here, it is my duty to destroy our Suits so they dont fall into enemy hands.We couldnt leave without doing that first.Now we can leave.Now we can DIE!You dont think theyre gonna see that smoke from ten clicks away?Theyre the only fresh plumes to be seen around here!Calm yourself down, comrade.Were wasting our time here now.Its time to go.The explanation didnt seem to go down well with the remainder of the group either.As Hannah approached Ian, she spoke to Toni.Tones, could you get the prisoners on their feet?she said before turning to the blonde.Id like to chat with you a moment, Ian.Is that alright?As the pair wandered out of earshot, Miura approached Kaiser.On your feet.Sergeant Miura.We have a problem, I think.Deadhand was not feeling well minutes ago, and now he will not wake up.We might need to carry   No ones gonna be carrying anyone!Deadhand, he called the wounded prisoner, giving him a tap with his boot.Get up now.NOW!The prisoner didnt budge.Carefully, Miura checked his pulse and breathing.Hes breathing.Come on, Deadhand, get up.Much to Kaisers delight, the soldiers fell on the contingency of wetting the prisoners face with water from their canteens, soon after escalating their efforts to lightly slapping his cheeks.The unconscious prisoner remained as he was, the turban of bandages around his head and swollen appearance lending realism to his fragility.Ray kept away from the prisoner, perhaps feeling guilty over the turn of events.Whats going on?Hannah asked as the two returned, Ians complexion considerably paler than before.The dark skinned ones not waking up ...hes breathing but not moving a finger, whatever we do ...Miura replied.Well simply have to organize a stretcher.No were wont  Ray countered, and he fired a rapid burst from his Lacrau into Deadhands head, tearing it apart.A deafening silence took hold of them all as they contemplated the twitching body on the ground, blood still pulsing from its multitude of wounds.Ian slowly raised his weapon to the shooters chest.Ray only smiled in return.Dont sweat it, Ian.Im giving Toni my rifle, see?We couldnt just drag this bastard for a thousand clicks while his buddies hunt us down.And now Kaiser here knows whatll happen to him if he slows us down.A wail caught them by surprise, and they turned to see Sueli fall to the ground and began to cry convulsively.As Hannah and Ian went to her, Toni approached Kaiser and put a knee to the ground.Im so sorry about this ...the youth whispered somberly.There is nothing to be sorry about, Sergeant.It was not you who committed a war crime, Kaiser replied with a sad smile.Inwardly, he was roiling with thought and emotion.He took a good look at the teenager who had murdered his fellow veteran.Ray kept away from his comrades and looked at the trees to his east, his face relaxed as it hadnt been before, no trace of guilt present.He doubted whether the medication they were under could come close to explaining that.He had not truly been Deadhands friend; they had never held that much in common with one other.But his subordinate had been an exceptional professional, and never the sort to leave a man behind.He had been a soldier right to the end.Which was why Kaiser was not going to forget Rays kindness.He could be very kind himself, if he wanted to be.I really need you to get up now, Major.He smiled at Miura once more, seeing the haunted expression on the boys face.Very well, Sergeant.I wouldnt want to slow you down any further.FIFTEEN      Mining quadrant, Natures Dawn, 15th of June, 2771      Birdsong woke Toni from an uncomfortable sleep.Stiffly he unhugged his arms from around his rifle and took a good look at his surroundings.Not much had changed since hed fallen asleep, except that it was presently a semi comatose Sueli who was guarding their prisoner.Kaiser was already fully awake and smiled widely at Toni in unspoken greeting.Toni nodded in return.He was beginning to find it difficult to dislike his prisoner.You awake, Toni?Hannah asked with a smile, already on her feet as she checked her travel pack.She and Kaiser must have common relations, he mused.He smiled in return.Looks like Im the only one who wasnt.Are we eating before were leaving?Were eating like were moving.Fast and light.Need a hand up?He didnt really need any assistance but accepted it anyway.He enjoyed the fleeting moment as his hand held hers.He had a nagging suspicion that he was setting himself up for bitter disappointment in the future.They breakfasted on what was left of their first days combat rations; Toni had managed to hoard an energy bar and most of his milk from the day before, although he offered some of both to Kaiser just as Hannah had yesterday.Kaiser gratefully accepted, his bindings having temporarily been removed to allow him to feed himself.The remainder of his comrades contented themselves with their own leftovers, although Ray raided his second days rations for its chocolate cake.As soon as they were finished, the group set off in the north westerly course they had been following over the last two days.Toni no longer knew what time it was; Ians watch had stopped working, killed by the twin EMPs from that awful day.And so they presently had no choice but to bow to the rhythms of nature itself.Somehow that simple act of submission to the forests biological pulse had afforded Toni a more fitful sleep than hed enjoyed in his lifetime, in spite of the hard ground.The only hitch was the knowledge that the winds from Thaumantias eye were not too long away.In only five days, Capicua would find itself at the perigee of its orbit with Gliese 667C, by which time the heating desert air at the supercontinents center would begin to rise and radiate towards the terminators.As that happened, the cooler, more humid air from the Crescent Ocean would be pulled towards the subsolar pole; the ensuing violent winds were well known for making life difficult for any unsheltered creature.The tempest would abate as the planet swung out to its apogee and the humid air would finally condense into a dense, continent wide cloud, and by the 26th of June the diluvian rains would begin to fall.It was not by coincidence that MEWAC Command had timed the Wild Rose campaign when it did.No one wanted to fight in hurricane winds, much less test their Suits flotation specs in battlefield conditions.But now Tonis small troop was on the move in a deeply furrowed forest, unprotected and with wounded among them, the plantation land having been left behind by the end of the first days march.Hey, Ian.Wasnt there a road from the plantations to Lograin on the maps?Toni asked as they marched in single file.Why do you want to know?Ian inquired coldly.It would be nice if we could be surer about our heading, not to mention that the road will be easier to travel on.And risk being seen from the air?I prefer the forest, thank you.Well just have to find another way to home in on the base.I  Toni suddenly stopped in his tracks.Slowly he began to walk again, thinking with every step.I think I know how we might do that, he finally said before continuing.Those comm devices we were allotted, they have a range of a couple hundred clicks.We could use them to relay our position   Except they were fried by the nukes, Tones, Ray interrupted.Did you even read the manual, mate?Theyre hardened against that.Our model might not have the GPS option, but each unit has a pendant cable about two meters long, and theyre interconnectable.If we link all our cables, spread them out high enough and connect them to a comm unit, Im sure we could extend the range by a few hundred clicks!Optimist, Hannah cut in.It might actually work, why dont we try it now, Ian said to Tonis surprise.Wait a second, he countered.Were way too close to the EarthFeds for that.Right now well have far greater chances of betraying our position than of contacting Lograin.Besides, what would the base do even if they knew we were here?Send a rescue mission?Were only about sixty clicks from where we got our asses kicked, remember?Ian looked somewhat annoyed but didnt insist on the matter.Got our asses kicked, for sure.You know what I keep thinking about?Ray asked.Getting your rifle back?Ian ventured.Nah, its in good hands so Ive no worries.Listen, I was thinking about what the Screamer told us in the casern before we deployed ...And what was that?Sueli asked, apparently clueless as to what he was talking about.What, he didnt talk to the femmes?Guess that goes to show what he thinks of you, ha!He told us that first contact would probably only end in one of two ways: easy victory or crushing defeat.And he told us to run like hell if it was the second.Hannah wrinkled her nose at the answer.Im kind of glad he didnt visit us, then.Its not very useful advice.If you think about it, thats exactly what we did all by ourselves.It would have been worse if youd stood your ground, dont you think?Toni interjected.Which begs the question.What happened so you ended up fighting the African?Werent you supposed to be the rearguard?We were the rearguard.And thats exactly where we were attacked.Either Davos punched through the van, or he took it out altogether, cause he reached us before any retreating front liners did.And you, Toni?How did you end up fighting Kaiser here?Werent you supposed to be retreating as well?she inquired, entertained by his sudden apprehension.I, uh, had some difficulties finding the retreat axis ...His reply was followed by a low chuckle from Kaiser.Yes, Sergeant Miura, indeed you appeared to have confused west with east, for when I found you, you were quite a few kilometers in that direction ...he declared.Really, Major?And just what was he doing there?Hannah inquired in mock seriousness.Why, dear lady, he was trying most diligently to kill me, he laughed.The answer seemed to take her aback, and she raised her eyebrows at Toni questioningly.I was lost ...he replied in a monotone as Kaiser chuckling softly.Nice, Tones ...he heard as Ray clapped him on the shoulder.The march became silent as they fell into a routine, the terrain challenging them as they moved into a land deeply gouged with natural spillways.There were fewer trees there, the space occupied by several bush species that formed an almost impenetrable tangle in some places.Toni knew the spillway, having crossed it in the opposite direction, and he also knew that it extended for over fifty kilometers.After several failed attempts to advance over the terrain, and then along the convoluted spillways themselves, he had finally proposed that they move north until they found the trail opened up by Main Forces passage.The proposal was gladly accepted, and before long they were northbound.The groups failed attempts to penetrate the broken land had cost them half a day, and by the time they reached the flattened ground marking Main Forces passage, the wildlife was settling in for slumber.They camped in a particularly dense clump of trees on a hill, in a location that afforded them ideal overwatch of the trail below.Their difficult progress, along with the decision to abstain from lunch in order to preserve rations, had begun to take its toll on the group.Only Kaiser kept his spirits up, despite having no choice but to share their hunger.As the cadets nibbled on salty biscuits, drinking water instead of milk or juice so as to have something for the following morning, Kaiser spoke of Earth and of the other planets that presently harbored terrestrial life.He spoke about the first missions to Alpha Centauri A, Epsilon Indi and Epsilon Eridani, which had succeeded in establishing multinational colonies on Earth like planets.He spoke also of the second wave of colonization, initiated thirty years afterwards, when the world economy had finally begun to recover from collapse.The second wave had focused on the colonization of the more numerous Red Dwarf systems, and so Mankind had extended its influence out to Bernards Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Lacaille 9352 and Gliese 1061, All falling neatly inside a twelve light year radius of Earth itself.Then came the mission to Gliese 667C, the only privately funded initiative of the lot.667Cs colonization was the most expensive to date at four Trillion Euros, having been conceived and carried out by a mega conglomerate of Japanese, Korean and European manufacturing companies, with employees and stockholders serving as colonists.The following centuries saw the consolidation of human presence in all locations, all under the auspices of the United Nations.And then four hundred years ago, it had all come to an abrupt end.A devastating war, the kind that could only arise from an exceedingly long peace, was fought between Earths Social and Capital Blocs, and had resulted in a draw.Which was one way of stating that both had been remarkably successful in nuking each other into oblivion.The world population abruptly slimmed to a mere billion, the number eventually falling to half that in the first ten years after the exchange.There had been survivors, but the global trauma caused by war led the earthlings to focus on domestic matters over the following three centuries.Until the planets ultimate unification under the Earth Federation.In a frenzy of activity, mankind reestablished contact with its colonies, extending its influence beyond the planetary surface to the Moon, then to Mars, and then finally to the remote stellar outposts.After their meager dinner, the group agreed to password and counter password procedure and settled in for the night, Toni as usual being the first to draw watch due to his injuries.As he sat there, watching Kaiser sleep and trying not to think about the throbbing pain in his arm, he felt a mild itch behind his ear.Giving the skin there a light scratch, he felt his driving patch slide easily into his hand.He held it there, noticing in satisfaction how, after six days of use, its surface was no longer sticky.In retrospect, Hannah probably hadnt saved his life when she warned him not to remove it.Although the principal withdrawal symptoms from the patchs Clonidine component was dangerous hypertension, he had already lost so much blood that his body probably would had welcomed it.But would it have been worth the risk to find out?Probably not, he decided.Too many novice drivers had stroked out due to having removed their patches before their time.As a rule, the patch would need to be replaced by another so as to keep their Clonidine level up, or the patch would have to remain attached for another three days, releasing the drug in ever more diminutive doses to attenuate the withdrawal symptoms.He wondered how many years it would take before his brain finally adapted to Suit locomotion, thus sparing him from medication.He wondered whether he would live that long.They had no way to measure the passage of time, and so Toni spent much of his watch walking in circuits around the camp, having as usual found that he was unable to remain still for very long.Fifty slow circuits later, something caught his attention and he looked skywards.His eyes saw nothing except for the treetops.His ears, however, warned him of a faint buzzing sound from the sky above them.He wondered who the drone belonged to.Remembering his binoculars, He quietly removed them from his travel pack and descended the high ground they were camped upon until the sky opened above him.He then heard a faint percussive sound from above and found that he wouldnt need the instrument to discover its source.High in the sky to his north east, he made out a distant black bloom that dissipated as he observed it, and from which a long, thin trail, as delicate as one penciled by an artist, curved downwards towards the ground.As he continued to watch, the falling object disappeared into the forest, and before long his eyes were rewarded with a rising plume from the skyline.He tried to gauge the distance with his rangefinder, but found that it was unable to measure distances beyond ten thousand meters.Mindful of his duties, he returned to the campsite and confirmed that Kaiser was still asleep.A long while passed by before Toni shook Sueli awake to be relieved.In the following morning, Toni informed them what he had seen on his watch.An argument quickly followed.I told you, I didnt see any other drone!Toni declared angrily for the second time.But there could have been one.Which means you could have been seen ...which means Lograin might already know where we are!Ray exclaimed hopefully.Theres no indication that it was on our side, Sueli retorted.The other drone, if there was one, could have been EFF, which means you might have given us away ...The way it fell made it clear it was coming from Lograin.And how many times must I say this?There was no other drone!he huffed.Was it coming from Lograin, or returning from there?Hannah asked softly, her almond eyes narrowing.Toni hated to admit it, but he was deeply regretting having abandoned the camp at all.They were right, of course.The optics of most UAVs were quite capable of picking up his figure if it contrasted clearly enough with the background.And it had been cloudless at the time, so his shadow would have been obvious.That was just the sort of detail that Air Recon software was designed to pick up.If the Capicuan UAVs were that good, he dreaded what capabilities the EFF drones might have.Alright, it is a remote possibility, he admitted, trying for some damage control.But dont forget that our friendly UAVs were knocked out around these parts as well, and from enemy ground fire.Theyve got something like a laser platform that does that from a distance.But this raises the possibility that the EFF could field drones to search for us, so I suggest we move parallel to the Main Force trail instead of on it.Toni, thats obvious.And now we must skip breakfast and move out on the double.Right, Ian?Hannah suggested.The looks they were giving him were like knifes in his gut.They moved out without further delay and even Kaiser looked sullen.That shouldnt have affected Toni in the least, but somehow it did.After all, the Earthling was his Catch, and in his mind that made it almost obligatory for the man to respect him.Their intention to move parallel to the trail proved impossible for the same reason they had searched it out in the first place.Before long the group was moving along the four meter wide path, exposed and in a great hurry.Toni occupied the rear, trying to ignore his shame as Ian pressed on at the head of the column with Kaiser following closely behind.As the march progressed, Hannah fell back slowly until finally she was marching beside him.You know, Toni ...she mused.If it wasnt for your occasional fuck ups, youd probably be a very reliable soldier.Yes, princess, you could be right about that ...he answered bitingly.She flashed him with a quick grin before continuing.Have you noticed anything odd between Ian and Kaiser?What?Besides Ian hanging on his every word?Besides Ian insisting on personally taking him out to pee all the time?Wait, you dont think theyve become ass mates, do you?Not anything like that ...she answered vaguely.Youre a heavy sleeper, so maybe you didnt notice, but when Ians guarding Kaiser in the night, they talk a lot.Too much.Whatever his family connections, I dont trust Ian and I dont like where this might be going ...Welcome to the club ...he began, but Hannah softly shushed him.Which club?Ray doesnt suspect much.Certainly Sueli doesnt either, I think.I mean, shes clever and all, but shes barely keeping up with current events.They marched quietly for a while, scrutinizing Ian and Kaiser as they walked side by side.Talking to him about this is pointless ...Toni finally said.Hannah only nodded.My arm isnt hurting as bad as it was, he lied, so maybe I dont need to be on first watch anymore.Ian was on last watch this morning, so he can do the first tonight and Ill go after him.Only I wont sleep while hes with Kaiser, Ill keep an eye out for an escape.Youre usually before him, so on the other nights you can eyeball them after your watch.What do you think?She gave a slight nod and returned to her place in the line, leaving him to think dark thoughts about his senior for the remainder of the morning.They lunched ravenously among the trees, arguing over how they would feed themselves for the remainder of their trek.The group had been traveling at a pace of about forty kilometers per day, but much of that had only been roaming.Ian estimated that it would take at least twelve days of marching before they came within pickup distance of Lograin.He also decided that whatever time was lost due to the winds could be compensated for with Tonis comm idea.Whatever happened, however, all agreed that if they didnt get free of the forests before the diluvian rains began to fall, their chances of survival would dissipate to zero.But if they had twelve days ahead and only two days of rations left, then the obvious conclusion was that they would eventually have to forage for food.After an inconclusive debate, the discussion was postponed and they set off for the trail once more.It proved to be a grueling afternoon.Kaisers usual contingency of covering his head with an undershirt proved insufficient to protect against the suns UV light, and his black bodysuit absorbed IR light as effectively as tar, slowly cooking him inside.Added to that, they soon found themselves moving along broken land.Their prisoner finally collapsed after a valiant effort, gasping for air like a fish out of water.For the remainder of the afternoon, the group was forced to carry the earthling on their backs, the effort pushing their already taxed bodies to their limit.Toni, preparing for his pitch to do the second watch, refused to be exempted from carrying him, although he suffered greatly as a result.Notwithstanding the need to stop occasionally to trade packs and prisoner between them, the group made good time, and by the time they were nearing the end of their day, they had cleared the spillway land and moved into the cooler, shadier forest beyond.Finding a small depression that hid them from their surroundings, the cadets settled down and began to treat their afflictions.No conversations from now on, Ian decided.We just eat what we have in our second ration and get some sleep.What, Toni?My arms not too bad anymore, Id like to shift my watch like everyone else.Alright?Toni said, trying to make it sound like nothing of consequence.The proposition gave Ian pause for thought, but finally he agreed.Fine, Ill do first watch, then wake you up.Now go eat.And that was that.Between Toni and Hannah, Ians watch was now bracketed by the two people who trusted him the least.Feeling proud of himself, he dined on aquaculture tuna in tough bread and drank only water, pondering on the fact that he hadnt had a single bowel movement in more than four days.Im turning into a brick factory, he thought, hoping there was nothing wrong with him.After his dinner, Toni chose his sleeping spot so as to be able to discreetly watch the pair.Hannah was right.They were awfully chatty, the two of them.He marveled with semi shuttered eyes at how Ians expressions were somehow more human as they spoke.Kaiser was a wily one, indeed, to be able to befriend him like that.The earthling had somehow managed to overcome the blonde cadets defenses.Or was it more complicated than that?The pair spoke for what felt like a long time, Ian squatting while the prisoner sat.Finally the sentinel stood, helped Kaiser to his feet, and led him out of the depression.Toni quietly rose and approached the lip.He was very cautious, his body involuntarily remembering the last time hed tried to follow Kaiser out of a depression.Peering over the terrain, he saw an unbound Kaiser relieving himself against a tree about forty paces away, his guard keeping a respectful distance.Once the prisoner had finished urinating, Ian approached with the strap.Toni decided to return to his spot as the pair turned towards camp, feeling foolish.Belatedly he realized that the only way to truly foil any escape attempt would be to cover them from up close.Before long, they had returned to the depression.Toni began to slide into sleep as he watched the pair holding another whispered conversation.His increasingly groggy mind noted that their expressions were becoming more serious, and he wondered whether he was imagining it.Ian shook him awake.Toni, your watch.Huh?Its your watch.Im going to sleep.Uh, right ...Toni cursed himself silently for having fallen asleep, realizing that he had just given them a perfect opportunity for escape.He approached Kaiser to find him still awake.Not going to sleep?he asked the prisoner.Kaiser smiled at him with tired eyes.I shall not be awake too long.That boy never stops asking questions.You seem tired yourself, Sergeant.Toni nodded.Ill sleep soon enough.Goodnight.Until tomorrow then ..
