And I have choices.Ill have the turkey ration, I tell the woman who takes my order.Sometimes I choose the beef.There are choices, but not that many.She just shoves the tray of turkey into my hand.Then she wheels her meal cart away.Its pretty much my only normal interaction of the day.I dont see many people besides Special Operative Langhorn.He appeared at my door one day, earlier than my alarm.Im here to train you, he said.I knew not to ask questions.I spend my days in a small facility just down the hall from my pod room.Theres a sim capsule in one quadrant, and strengthening and cardio trainers spread among the other three.I have no friends.SpecOp Langhorn trains me.Im not in as good shape as I thought I was.My only rest is when I return to my sleeper to review rules and regulations on my holoreader.For a week, he explains how to use the new equipment and technology.I complete weapons training and grow to like using pacifiers and decoys, even though blasters are more efficient.When I can finally plug myself in and operate the transmission valves, he leaves.No good bye, nothing.Hes programmed me to follow my daily schedule.After my morning workout, I spend my days observing SpecOps training on the earfeed.No visual projections, not yet.I just sit there with my earfeed turned up.I record the teams actions and file my report at the end of every day.I should listen and learn.Thats what Langhorn instructed.Im alone at night, too.This is not forever, I know that.But sometimes it feels that way.Ive been listening to the guys as they prepare for their next mission.They do not give me their names, simply tell me to refer to them as Op O and Op C.  To them, Im Apprentice L.  They run diagnostics on equipment and discuss tactical strategies endlessly.They know Im here, but they mostly ignore me.I dont ask questions, just like Langhorn told me.Dont ask, dont speak.Thats the apprentice motto.From what I can put together, theyre targeting a rebel troublemaker.Not to take him out, not yet.This first mission is just recon.The rebels control a small base that distributes supplies throughout their entire network.Its been designated a Class 2 scenario.I think about the final exam.The scenario we faced was built off a real SpecOp mission.That one was rated Class 4.Lunatic fringe elements.Cannibalistic proclivities.Even the Islanders dont get real meatno one doesbut these savages do us one better and take it from each other.If someones missing a limb, its probably because someone else got hungry.I dont sleep the night before.I pace my room.I want to be down there with them.I want to hurt someone.I want to destroy those dirtmongers.This time for real.By the time O and C finally hit the ground, Ive been granted access to the visual feed.The feed is so dark I can hardly see anything.Apprentice L, do you copy?says O.   Yes.Were currently en route, he says.His voice is low, even when I increase the audio.Both Os and Cs feeds are running simultaneously on my monitors, but I can barely discern their outlines, despite my sensory gifts.Theyre sitting in a powered down dirt ranger scouter.The parameters of their mission are basic: Survey the target location.Paint suspected rebel bases of operation with guidance lasers.Return to headquarters.So far, all theres been is silence and darkness.I strain to see something on the monitor.I think I can see Cs hand moving across the controls of their stolen vehicle.I cant be sure.I wasnt expecting fun, but its almost painful to be this powerless.I chart their location on a known map of the area.Cave ins and the shifting of the earths plates change the terrain of the Lower Levels frequently, so for all we know, this map is useless by now.Now would be a terrible time to find that to be true.Nearing quadrant minus eighty three, says O.   Theres a long enough silence for me to doubt myself.To know if what Im doing is right.Approaching suspected rebel HQ.Theres a faint light ahead of them.Theyve switched on the scouters antique beamers, but its range is so limited.Then I see it: the target.A mountain of stones rises from the void.The map indicates the tunnel should not have ended so abruptly.Transporters rumble through the uncharted blackness ahead.They cross the scouters path, but no one identifies the stolen vehicle for what it is.The mountain grows closer in the dark, then I see it.Coming from the left side on the projector feed.A shadow, barely detectable.They must see that, I think.I cant be the only one seeing that.O and C dont speak.The shadow approaches.Im so close to the monitor projection I almost bump my nose on it.I feel my eyeballs expanding.An enemy craft.Thats what it is.Crude blasters attached to the sides, pointed and ready.Armored craft, vectoring at minus sixty three, I bark before I can stop myself.Aiming to fire!Within a millisecond, the scouter redirects and the videofeed goes ballistic with live fire.I bolt up and throw the headset off, my ears splitting with the first barrage of the firefight.My senses can get overloaded easily.Its part of the reason I keep these abilities to myself.By the time I stop reeling, the feeds gone out.I wait by the monitor as patiently as I can to hear from O and C.  Instead, Langhorn buzzes in on my earfeed and says, I told you not to speak.Ive waited three hours for this reprimand, and Im still grateful.Affirmative, I say.I saw the craft and  Quiet, Apprentice, he barks.I shut up.You alerted the Ops just in time, he says, calmer.They retreated unharmed.My pride surges, but Im not expecting a compliment.I just do the work that needs to be done.Your training isnt complete, but higher ups believe youre ready to be called up.In two days, youll be taken to your forward operating base.My stomach jumps.I wait for his kudos.The line goes dead.Even with his lack of warmth, Im still elated.Two days to report.Enough time to meet Kane, just like we planned.Ill get to tell him about the end of my apprenticeship.Ill get to see him before I begin my new life.Im waiting for Kane in his childhood memory.Everything is too bright, the edges all blurred.Still, it beats anything Ive got.I was taught that your experiences are filed away by the High Council, and a handful are made available to you.How they get them, Im still not sure.These are the incidents they deem important, pivotal points in your growth and development.Good times, bad times, I hope theyve captured it all.Youre issued a memory chip as soon as youre old enough for the experiences not to induce trauma and youre expected to learn from these highlights of your life.Recruiter gave me my first one on the way to the Academy.I put it in, expecting some massive understanding to how life screwed me over, and then I just got the same thing I always got: nothing.Complete and utter darkness.It was like the Orphanage had never happened.I kind of wished that were true.Memory Archives are personal.Its strictly forbidden to go into someone elses.You wouldnt understand their memory anyway, Instructor explained during our unit on Archives: The Universe in an Access Chip.The memory is personalized, their emotions captured instantaneously to be infused into the database.The colors and sounds will reflect their inner state.Archives arent duplicated experiences, theyre subjective.Without the proper framework, going in as a stranger could induce brain trauma, and remains strictly prohibited by the High Council.Not that Kane ever cared about rules.Not that I dont already feel brain damaged.Now, waiting for Kane in his eighth birthday, I understand.The colors are so vivid they hurt my eyes.Maybe all memory Archives are like this.Maybe everything is brighter in our memory.Or maybe its so bright because Kane never came here before.Something not worth revisiting or something he wanted to stay away from.You degrade an Archive every time you visit, just like the make believe at the Orphanage.Thats the only memory I could keep returning to.I hear Kanes voice in my head.Ill meet you on my eighth birthday.On my family island.Behind the obelisk.Im on his island and I found the obelisk.Now wheres Kane?Im in a small clearing bordered by a copse of trees.Everything seems enormous.Ive always wanted to see a real synth tree, but Im sure theyre nothing like these ones.They tower over me.You can drown in their shade.I must be seeing everything from Kanes eight year old eyes.The world seems too big around me, and too small at the same time.Ive been circling the same grounds since I got here, unable to get a glimpse past its border.I can only imagine how far his childhood estate stretches.I reach out, the rubbery surface buzzing under my touch, but then it pushes my hand back.If I try again, I might be flung from the memory.Then Id never see Kane.Breaking into the Archive access room was risky enough.I waited until late at night and snuck through the Cadet Quarters.I briefly stopped to look at the entrance to rooming pod 13, my former home.It hadnt changed.Neither had the camera positions or the instructor floor sweeps.Their patterns Kane and I had long ago memorized.The quarters were quiet, the cadets dead asleep.I didnt belong there.Not anymore.I felt stupid for even thinking it possible.I moved on, crept my way to the Archive access room.Breaking the code on the room itself was easy; Kane taught me a dozen ways to bypass.The chip locker was a little tougher, but SpecOps training has its advantages.I build stuff, Kane once said while rewiring a beamer to glow green, and you take them apart.That made me smile.In the times Im not actively apprenticing, I learn stuff from the patrol Archives.Stuff that would be considered illegal in the hands of others.I cracked the code.The chip locker slid open.I scanned the names, finding Kanes memory box.They keep them here until we graduate and have served out our probationary period in our official placement.But dont worry, Kane told me.You can just keep it for me.Give it back when you see me.I punched in the code he gave me.The box buzzed and popped open.I locked the door behind me and sat on the cold steel floor.Heart thumping wildly, Id tapped my wrist, put my thumb tip to my pulse, inserted the chip, and closed my eyes.Instantly, I was here.On the memory of soft synth grass.I was in Upper Indra for the first time.Even in someone elses memory, it felt real.Not to mention strange.Time works funny here.However long Im here, only a fraction of that time will have passed in the real world.Still, Ive got to worry about someone discovering me.Pretty soon, the cadets will get up.Theyll do appearance maintenance, eat their rations, and head off to class.Ill be found out eventually, I know.I kill time walking the memory perimeter.Its border looks like dense fog.Cmon, Kane.Where are you?I find a makeshift campsite: bedding, a supply of wafers.Kane spent a lot of time here, I can tell.Probably even slept here sometimes.Its his birthday.Why would he remember being at this place?Where is everyone?Birthdays are important, Ive learned.At least, they are to people outside the Orphanage.Funny, since I dont even know the date of mine.All I got every year was a visit from the recruiter.From what Ive seen at the Academy, everyone wants to be around you on your birthday.Yet Kane spent his eighth one here.By himself.Kane was alone a lot, I guess.Just like me.This was the place he made sculptures and sound paintings before he had a Center of Creation.These sculptures are made of cast off scraps, just like at the Academy.Only the materials are different: Tree limbs, fancy ration plates broken in half.Pieces of shiny metal.High quality stuff.Stuff people would miss if they cared.But obviously, they dont.I think of Kanes sculpture in the Center of Creation studio.The metal face he made with the eyes protruding on spikes.These pieces are frightening too, but different.More childlike and obvious: monsters from bad dreams that hide under your sleeping pod.Kane was weird.Even as a kid.That makes me smile.Looking for me?says a voice.I spin around quickly, already on edge, knowing immediately that somethings gone wrong.A shadow steps out from behind the obelisk, and then Cassinas standing in front of me.Not who you were expecting?She pouts like shes sad for me.I dont answer.Shes wearing her new PCF Security uniform.How predictable.Shes protecting Indra.Assigned to the public projects, news of them running along holoscreens to make the Indrithians feel secure, like installing defense gates in the Hub.I can see her pained smile on an awareness campaign projected on the side of Indras glass towers: Indra Gives You What You Need.Shes holding her pointy chin high, which makes it plenty exposed.The pride of holding an official public position.Her main obligation?Look important, probably.They dont even carry blasters on them in most sectors.Shes probably living on Apprentice Island with all the other cadets.Her same group, following her around.Just killing time till they cohabitate and relocate to an island.Things change, but not really.I wonder if Kane is on Apprentice Island with her.I wait for her to speak.I think of the small blaster on my hip.It wont kill her here, but it will boot her quick and give her a massive headache.Wow, she says, looking at a spiky sculpture made of ration forks.Kane did this?He was always ...different.Why are you here?I say.Isnt that the question I should be asking you?In case you havent picked up on it, my family is very, very, very important.Therefore, I matter.She smiles.Her chin has gotten even pointer.More than an orphan ever could.Ive had enough.I start for her and she backs up, eyes wide.Stop, she says, her voice catching.Kane!Kane!Im so close, shes shrinking back.Wheres Kane?I ask.Get any closer to her and wed be cohabitants.Take out his access chip and Ill show you.Why not show me here?You cant access an Archive within another Archive, so ...You first.She nods.Therere no instructors here to save you if youre lying, I say.She nods again.Its not a trap, I tell myself.I narrow my eyes.I have no choice.I reach for my chip, but only after she reaches for her own.Im back in the Archive access room, getting up from my resting position.Cassina stands too, right across the room from me, both of us holding the Archive access chips.Howd you find me?I ask.She grins.Indra has its way of finding you all.Even if you didnt stray that far.Dont you get that by now?My security placement grants me total access.Whereas yours grants you a one way trip core low.She thinks her life is all sweet.Out here in the real world, somehow she has more control.Howd you get a copy of it?I ask her.She just stares at me.Where is he?Tell me!She reaches into her pocket and holds out another access chip.Put this in and youll see for yourself.Its another of Kanes memories.You first.I only have one.Its hard enough sharing this with you, I dont want to share it with you.And he gave it to you?She nods.I have no idea if shes telling the truth.Shes only ever wanted me to fail.Why stop now?We stare at each other and her face softens.Shes never been a good actress.Because, she says quietly, hes hurt.Ive never seen so much hate in her eyes, but this time theyre telling the truth.My mind clouds whenever I try to figure her out.But she seems to be worried about Kane, and that makes me worried.After all your training, havent you learned that rebels never win?she says, holding out the chip.In my after hours Ive learned how you can weaponize everything, even an access chip.Once an Archive starts, youre supposed to be able to jump out at any time.But there are ways around it.False memories could wreck your mind for a lifetime.You could get trapped and never know you were out of touch with the real.Youd be lost in there just like a shadow person for all eternity.I hold out my upturned palm.She drops the chip in my hand, pinching her lips at the thought of touching me.Using the chip could be dangerous for all those reasons.But most of all, I fear that learning the truth may be the most dangerous thing of all.But its Kane, so I have no choice.12           Emergence Ball         Excerpted from The Book of Indra,  V: Indra: Society and Customs  The Indrithian upper elite abide by a given set of unspoken laws.The young people are allowed monitored interaction in the form of Socialization Clubs and balls.At seventeen, the young women will be introduced to society through their Emergence Ball, and soon after they must choose a mate, cohabitate, and embark on the journey of being Proper Indrithian Citizens.Livia   Im spinning and the world is watching.Elevated high above the Helix Grand Ballroom, with each rotation I alter my pose.I move as slowly as the platform itself, my face emotionless, yet projecting the countenance of an esteemed Proper Young Woman.In the words of Etiquette Tutor, As though you have barely a thought in your head.My body may be languid, but my mind is speeding.I look beautiful, of this Im sure, Marius and Governess having lavished me with endless praise; even more, I have seen my own startling reflection.I dont know this girl, I thought, considering the stranger before me.A Proper Young Woman, to be sure.The dress every shade of blue, trailing in long and filmy waves, shimmering like the simulated ocean.Skin flawlessly creamy, lips rose pink.Every inch of her fretted over and perfected, every flaw deliberated over and eliminated, each hair glossed and painstakingly coiled.Proper Young Women are built.It takes more than a day, it takes a lifetime.In terms of competition, there is none.I am immaculate, all except for my thoughts.Below, the guests observe me with alarming intensity.Not all of Upper Indra, of course, but their eyes make me feel that way.A record turnout in Emergence Ball history, Marius informed me, moments before my grand reveal.Remember, my love, tonight is the night for you to have everything youve ever wanted.Do your best, for me, for your parents.Just look at you.Youll take their breath away.When the music began, the room hushed.The curtains parted from around me, the invitees giving their requisite intake of breath, and I began my slow ascent upward.Faces rapt, they watched me rise.Now, they watch me spin.Do not show pain, said Etiquette Tutor.Nor discomfort.Nothing is less appealing to a Proper Young Man than a woman lacking in endurance.Clear your head of needless concerns and focus on the task at hand.The truth is far less simple.Id heard the frightful tales during Pleasant Interaction, whispered recounts brimming with nervousness.With our debuts growing closer, little else seemed worthy of discussion.Clearing our heads was easier said than done.Yes, an utter debacle, Mica told the others, too willing to recount the details of disastrous debuts and reputations never to recover, never failing to throw a glance in my direction.She proved herself an utter fool.Id been Chosen Girl for so long I couldnt imagine being unchosen.Since the moment I succeeded in staying on that platform sixty feet in the air, Mica had stopped speaking to me, not even for a Pleasant Interaction.Mica hadnt spoken to me, but she spoke about me plenty.That day and every day following, I was relegated to pleasantly interacting with Cybele.Despite have grown into a lovely Young Woman, shed never shaken Etiquette Tutors curse, destined to be of unappealing physical appearance.Yet even she seemed disturbed at having to speak with me.Of course, I made little effort to change her mind.The weather is lovely, do you not agree?If you say so, I responded.Very mild, I have noticed, with the slightest of breeze.As mild as yesterday and the day before, I said.As mild as it will remain, every day until eternity, as so dictated by the Aero Crown.She sighed, never losing the strained smile.We went on like this for some time, I all the while catching the whispers of Micas still exclusive circle.They told the same few stories, growing more horrific with each retelling, but always came back to their favorite.The Girl Who Fell, according to Mica, happened two debut cycles ago.Six foot two and from excellent genetic stock, graced with a delightful bone structure and pleasant manner.She collapsed on the platform, she told them, and was lowered immediately.Slapped her until she regained consciousness, lifted right back up.She finished the rotation, but never once ceased her incessant sobbing.Turning and turning, all eyes on her, tears streaking down her face.Could not even wipe her running nose for fear of breaking the poses.In the end, Mica said, voice bursting with foreboding, the only cohabitant available was under six feet!Even worse, he secretly preferred the company of other Young Men to her own!Now she is left alone on her estate, as he spends his days on a faraway one frolicking away the time with another Young Man of similar interests.In the old world, before the Great Catastrophe, this kind of life choice was considered acceptable.You were free to love who you pleased and spend your life with the mate of your choosing.And yet, somehow we have regressed in Indra because of the IHCs pursuit of perfecting our population through controlled procreation.For all the warnings of the world before the Great Catastrophe, I often question whether they were more evolved than us in some capacities.Im sure they didnt spin on platforms for audiences brought in to judge them.At least, unless that was of their own choosing.Of course, saying such things would be considered Anti Indrithian Hate Speech and is highly illegal.But how can the High Council control my thoughts, when even I cant?Her own fault, the others would say to Micas every retelling of the story, voices rising in a chorus of pity.Perhaps she never took etiquette lessons seriously.It seemed odd, Mica choosing this story.After all, she had fallen off the platform that day herself and many times after until she had perfected it.And yet, these rules of logic didnt apply to her as they did to others.Just as Micas failure was never mentioned, my ousting from her circle went unquestioned.At some point, I repeated the tale of The Girl Who Fell to Marius, and then waited for the confirmation it was only gossip.Instead, she shook her head tragically.I saw the whole unfortunate event, the poor thing.I only wished I could pass her a handkerchief.She neednt elaborate further.Besides, Mica had already been successful: I was suitably terrified.This platform spin would be far worse than the one Etiquette Tutor had given us, of that I was certain.After only a few spins, becoming the new Girl Who Fell seems a distinct possibility.It is one thing to keep yourself balanced on a spinning platform in class, but doing so while holding elegant poses and pretending a hundred sets of eyes arent blazing into you?That is entirely different.Youll take their breath away, Marius told me.Yet the cincher that Governess insisted on is pulled so tight, I am gasping for my own.I rotate, comforted by the knowledge my Debut Spin will take less than an hour, yet knowing that at any moment the cincher might cease my breathing altogether.The dress, weighted down with countless layers and intricate beading, is threatening to pull me to my knees.I feel as though Ive embarked on a battle with my own attire, and the gown might well prove the victor.And then there are the stares.The eyes burning into me, the mock whispers behind fans echoing upward, little being done to hide them.Are these not the most proper of Proper Indrithians?The worst offender?Mica, of course.Surrounded by her gaggle of adoring admirers.Not inviting her wouldve been disastrous for my reputation, Governess had warned me, not giving me a choice in the matter.But having her watch me is equally horrific.Strangely enough, she doesnt say a word.She simply stares, I feel her urging me to fail.This is an Emergence Ball, after all, and serves a single purpose: for the gathered crowd to come to judgment as to the quality of the goods set out before them.The goods, in this case, being Livia Cosmo.Even from this high up, their voices carry.Its something Etiquette Tutor never prepared us for.The acoustics of the Grand Ballroom assault my heightened senses with incessant whispers.Well, there is the name, of course.The Cosmo legacy.That alone ups her value.......and the estate is magnificent, you must agree on that.Could do with a more attentive garden crew, but still, the possibilities.If the cohabitant relocates here, perhaps he will see to these details....I have heard it said she is rather defiant.Pity, seeing as she is pleasing to the eye.Perhaps if she never spoke!Terribly wicked of me to say, I know, but there are procedures ...I listen to their babble, their predictions for my future, all the time focused on steadying my breathing.Im aware of my every last twitch.I cant lose control of myself.I know whats expected: spin as to appear motionless, stare as into nothingness.Keep movements slow and measured and nearly imperceptible.Let this end, I think, inching from one position to another.Below, the Young Men are meant to be memorizing my poses.This is only tradition; every Proper Young Man was taught the Courting Dance in childhood.Later, if later ever arrives, I will repeat this dance with each of them.There are so many, it will take hours and hours.At least they cannot touch me.They will try to get close, Etiquette Tutor warned us.As close as they can.And here is the secret: if you find one of them to be utterly unappealing, force him to touch you.This must appear accidental, of course, or you might incite scandal.But if carried out correctly, the Young Man will face immediate expulsion.In the case of Young Men to which you are drawn, those you would not mind touching you, never be overtly forward.Be available, yet withdrawn.Alluring, yet modest.Show too much interest and you will send the wrong message.Whats the wrong message?I had wanted to ask.That you actually like them?Is that not the point of the whole miserable evening?It seems unfair that Proper Young Men dont have debut balls.Instead, they come to ours and watch us spin with smirks on their faces.We have the power, Ive been told, for we may choose the Proper Young Man we like best.At the same time, theyre allowed to reject us.It makes little sense to me, the whole occasion.Choose a man you hardly know and await his acceptance or rejection?Yet on what basis is he accepting you?How well you turn in circles?Another spin, another pose.A few minutes pass.A few more.The perspiration drips down my flesh, torturing me, the gown growing heavier with each passing moment.The cincher squeezes, my pain steadily intensifying.My whole body aches; my insides are screaming.Focus, Livia.Circle and pose.Circle and pose.My future spins below me.I try not to look down.With the time it takes for the platform to lower, my admirers still silently pray for me to fall.But it is once the platform has secured me to the ground that the real torture begins.There are so many Young Men they begin to blend together.I want to see all of them fail.Some I have seen before, on the rare occasions of a required Socialization Club mixer.Then there are the strangers.Young Men from the farthest islands, alternate education clusters.Many have come from across all of Indra simply to witness me.Not me, of course.The idea of me.The famous geneticists daughter with a vast estate and legendary name.The Cosmo Airess.I am Livia, I want to tell them.And I am strange and confused and prefer my horse to any person.Of course, I cannot say this, or little else of importance.I am well versed in the List of Acceptable Topics for Emergence Ball Conversation.Hours off the revolving platform and Im still spinning.Its unclear where I begin and the music ends.I keep waiting to feel something.A flame of passion, Etiquette Tutor calls it.At this point, I would settle for even a weak spark.As soon as one Young Man exits, another replaces him, immediately taking the Courting Dance initial position.At least I need not offer much in the way of conversation; they are happy to speak for the both of us.They only have a short time with me, and theyre not about to waste it.They tell me Im beautiful.They love Helix Island.This is the best Emergence Ball they have ever seen.They love the color scheme, for white is their favorite color.They try to impress me with their range of talents.Speak of their leisure pastimes.The numerous targets they hit in archery, the extraordinary lengths they throw the discus.They tell me how important their family is, how big their estate, how vast their wealth, how very much they matter.Please say something interesting, I think.An hour passes.And another.Im exhausted, every muscle aching, the cincher still biting into my flesh.It has eaten more than I have.The same answers, the same questions.The same musical refrain and poses.The party?Absolutely divine.Discus throw?How fascinating.You dont say!Is that so?Isnt that lovely.Wonderful.Intoxicating.Exhilarating.Yes, Im having a lovely time.Yes, you are fascinating.Yes, I want to die of boredom.I respect your legacy, this Proper Young Man says.Your father was a genius.And might I add, blue is a color in which you are especially fetching.You know my father as little as I do.They fight to catch my glance between poses.Gaze intensely, trying to convey silent messages: I am deeply sensitive, Livia.I understand you, Livia.I am the one for you, do you not see?All I see is the Ending.Of anything that ever mattered to me.My favorite flower sonnet is The Petunia, he says.I smile so hard my jaw hurts.Then something stops me.Someone.You despise every moment of this, he says.Me included.Hands in the air, palm facing palm.I do not ...know you, I say, caught off guard.That makes little difference.I do not understand your meaning, I say.I mean you hate this.The ball, the attention.The whole core low thing.I can tell.I can tell a lot of things about you.Pivot and turn.Now he has my attention.For example?Well, to start with, none of this means a thing to you, he says quickly.Youd rather be anywhere else but here.And you think no one has anything interesting to say.A bit egotistical of you  What did you  But also correct.And you cannot stop thinking, I have to pick from these mindless Islanders and listen to them prattle about midday tea receptions and the importance of the status quo for the rest of my life.Perhaps Im hallucinating.For the first time, I really look at his eyes and theyre unlike the other Young Mens.As though they have seen the unexpected.He stares right back.For significantly longer than is proper.You have such interesting eyes, he says.Left arm up, chin to shoulder.If what you were saying was true, I say, and I am not saying it is, but if it was ...on what do you base your shockingly forward assumptions?Pivot and turn.Now we are closer.Did he make that happen?I wonder.Did I?On myself.Im exactly the same, Livia.Im just like you.Hands in the air.Were almost done.Back where we started.Palm to palm facing each other.The slightest movement.Thats all it would take.Barely an inch and we would be touching.It is as though he has a power source hidden inside of him, his skin almost seeming to crackle.And yet, I cannot sense him at all.As though he has built a wall around his true feelings.We arent like the others, he says fiercely.Nor would we choose to be.The final pose, the final note.His turn is over.He steps back and smiles politely.A rush of cold air takes up the space where his heat was.A deep curtsy, a manly bow.Then he is gone, quicker than I would have liked.I strain to glimpse him through the crowd of bodies, then notice the faces.Hundreds of them, staring at me with curiosity, oozing with judgment.He didnt even say his name.May I?I swing around.My next partner, grinning at me.Six foot two, superior bone structure, all the signs of exemplary genetics.Empty eyes on a face I have seen many times before.Is this not enchanting?he says as we take our first pose.The Helix Grand Ballroom is said to be the grandest in all of Indra, though Ive never seen any others, except for what serves as one at the Socialization Club.Ive never been invited, though Marius assures me that with the right cohabitant, the social snubs will cease, though I wonder for how long.Ive never really cared about the Helix Grand Ballroom until now.Im at my own dining platform, elevated above the others.The Finest of Indrithian Society are seated below me, their tables extending to the perimeter of the room.I cant see him anywhere.I scan the crowd, Young Men looking up expectantly as my eyes pass over them.Dejected, I push the leg of lamb around my plate.More historical re creations, only slightly less repulsive than the kidney, though it smells much the same.Ive lost my appetite completely.I lift my forkmeat fork, not salad forkand pretend to take a bite.Where has he gone?Perhaps I only imagined him, the cincher completely cutting off oxygen to my brain.I put down my fork and pick up my fan to look sufficiently busy.The guests engage in Polite Conversation Befitting a Formal Engagement.With so many guests, the volume is a polite roar.I notice a few Young Men have risen to their feet, milling about and chatting amicably, their eyes continuously flickering in my direction.The fan, I think.Now I have unintentionally opened the door, given them a signal that Im open to their attentions.I fan slowly with the left hand: please do not approach, for I am otherwise engaged.Just a quick shift to the right hand and a more rapid movementnow Im ready for youand they will come racing, ready to smother me with their affection.Will this ever end?I sense a wave of annoyance, and am not surprised at the source.Governess, sitting near the front of the table.A quick jaunt to Rejuvenation Island and now her skin is stretched so tightly that her eyes angle upward, which doesnt prevent her from glaring at me through her slits.I feel her desperation for me take some sort of action.Next to her, Waslo holds court, entertaining half the table with his wit.With me, hes sullen, always scrutinizing for imperfections.Among other Indrithians of Importance, he expresses charm and mirth.I dont like him either way.Next to him, Marius is watching me.Despite her tiny frame, her grace seems to dwarf the others around her.Next to Marius, they appear to be practiced, laughing with strained faces, leaning forward, overly eager.She catches my eye and smiles encouragingly.Shes worried.I made her a promise, yet Im putting forth little effort.Theres someone I wish to know more of, I imagine telling her, but he disappeared as mysteriously as he arrived.He made the others seem even less interesting, if thats even possible.Without noticing, Ive begun to fan faster.I slow myself down, but its too late, for I have already attracted curiosity.The Young Men ease closer, seemingly poised to sprint toward me at any moment; the enormous ballroom feels smaller, the walls angling in on me.I look upward, swearing the massive chandelier is lower than before, wondering if, within moments, the ceiling will drop and crush me.Im suddenly dizzy.Long off the platform, yet everything is once again spinning.I fear I might faint.If I faint, at least Ive been taught how to react.Soon I will be a cautionary tale told during Pleasant Interaction.That is when I see Mica.Not socializing or engaging in interaction, pleasant or otherwise.Simply staring at me from the far left side of the table.Surely thats a sign of rudeness.I know exactly what shes thinking: I will never be one of them.I will never be an Indrithian of Importance, no matter how hard I try.I know shes right.And even worse, I dont care to try.I dont remember standing, yet Im on my feet.Theyre sore and pinched, but theyll do.The room has gone silent.Everyone is looking at me.Again.Keep your wits about you, Livia.I give a girlish sigh.Smile charmingly, lower my eyes bashfully.Tap my left cheek with my fan: Might you be so kind as to pardon me?I dont give them time to answer.I know Helix Island, even in the dark.I exit the main quarters with graceful strides, chin lifted high, as though seeking a quick breath of fresh air.Overcome with emotion, I imagine Governess telling the table, her pained smile pulling her face to its breaking point.She needs merely a moment to gather her thoughts.Grace and quiet composure, that is our Livia.In the dark, I bound forward, stumble awkwardly over my train, and go tumbling.A grunt slipping from between my clenched teeth, I hoist myself back to standing, lift the sides of my gown, and knot them in front of me.I kick off my dainty shoes.I watch them fly, making blue arcs through the darkness.I rub my feet in the dirt until I know theyre absolutely filthy.Only then do I run.The air is chilly on my bare legs, the grass soft beneath me.I shake out my carefully constructed hair, pins flying, and rake my fingers through the strands, eager to annihilate each perfectly arranged coil.I realize Im still wearing my sash.I reach around and pull as hard as I can.I hate this sash, I tell the empty air, pulling as I run.The fabric unwinds from around me, the tail unfurling, growing longer and longer until it disappears into the darkness.I hear laughter and realize its me.Intoxicated with my own freedom, I reach for my cincher.Hours to strap me in, and a few mere tugs to escape.Within moments, my rib cage expands, my chest rising.I breathe in the fresh air, taking in as much as I can possibly hold, the oxygen overwhelming me with giddiness.Islanders are built for high altitudes, having adapted throughout the generations.Those who come from the Lower Levels face long adjustment periods, their lungs becoming starved for oxygen, Life Guide once explained.What you mean to say, I hadnt dared respond, is they should not have come in the first place.Everything is made a prison here.Even our own bodies.The price of beauty is hidden behind torture machines.I see my destination in the distance and move faster.A silver dome growing larger with each stride.My father built Vedas stable and around it, a track.Veda can run, but only in circles.In that way, we have a lot in common.Of course, I programmed Archives for her to access when I could not be with her.She could escape at any moment: to a field to romp through, hills to climb, rivers in which she could wade.Yet she knew these werent real, just as I knew the ocean was lost to us forever.Veda!I call, rushing into the stable.Her white face rises instantly, eyes warm in greeting.She whinnies and stamps her feet, turns a few quick circles.This happy dance has always been my greeting.I run to her and rest my cheek against her silky mane.How many times have I done this?Run to Veda when there was nowhere else to go?As a child, she would rest her muzzle on top of my head, though now she must use my shoulder.Things change, but very little.On this occasion, Im grateful.Now you may cry, I tell myself.The tears dont require more urging; they fall and disappear into Vedas silky mane.Livia.His voice sends a shiver down my spine.Veda lifts her head and peers over my shoulder.Im safe, I know, or else she would have warned me.Instead of rearing up, she simply stares, her brown eyes warm and curious.How did you know where to find me?I ask, unwilling to turn yet.I will not be seen in this weakness.I pull myself tall, use the backs of my hands to dry the wetness from my cheeks.This is where I would go, he says.Even without turning, I can sense his feelings are strong.Hes here to do something important, though I cant imagine anything of importance here, in Vedas stable.Other than Veda, that is.Only once I have returned to myself, made myself mimic a Proper Young Woman once more, am I ready to face him.Hes hiding something.The other boys are so open with their desires, but this one stares at me strangely and has secrets he would never share.I thought you might not exist, I say nonchalantly.That perhaps I conjured you from my imagination simply to pass the time.He doesnt answer or look away.Staring, as I am sure you are well aware, is a blatant disregard of proper etiquette, I say.Have you seen yourself lately?I glance down and realize he may have a point.A debutee with bare legs and dirty feet, gown knotted at her waist, hair permitted to go wild, isnt much of a debutee at all.I dont have to answer for my appearance, I tell him.I dont want you to, he says softly.I like you much better like this.For a second, I lose my train of thought.Whos he to make me uncomfortable?You dont belong here, I tell him, hearing the haughtiness in my own voice.True.I dont.You are the intruder, not I.   Agreed, he says.I wait for an explanation.He doesnt offer one.Well?I say finally.Have you nothing more to say to me?Apparently not.I pick up Vedas brush, turning my back to him, and neaten her mane.Veda looks at me oddly; Im well aware she prefers to be untamed.Theres no sound from behind me.I only hope hes done the appropriate thing and left.So why do I feel a sudden heaviness upon me?Veda looks past me and I know hes still there, but I finish her grooming before I turn.Hes so close I could touch his face.Not that I want to.He smiles as though hearing my thoughts.None of this makes any sensebeing in the stable during my own ball, my missing sash probably flying through the clouds by now.The fact that Veda, who is usually abhorrent of strangers, is playfully nudging the side of my face and giving a serene whinny.Most implausible of all?This strange boy in front of me with a calm, self satisfied smile.The fact that I cant sense his feelings, only guess, while my own frustration rises.Nothing is logical here, the whole situation utterly maddening.He moved nearer when I wasnt looking.Dont come any closer, I tell him.Why?he says, already inching forward.I dont want you to, I tell him, hearing the lie in my own voice.And for a Proper Young Man, that should be reason enough.I am not a Proper Young Man, he says.Im Kane, and I certainly wouldnt mind another Courting Dance with you as my partner.In that instant, I feel him.Its as though the wall hes maintained suddenly explodes, and his emotions rush toward me with a surprising intensity.He wants to kiss me.The revelation is disconcerting, to say the very least.Thats prohibited, I say.What is?I can sense the heat coming off him.What you want.You are strange, Livia Cosmo, he whispers.That is a fact of which I am well aware and is rude of you to say.It would be so easy to reach for him.Funny, he says, but you remind me a lot of someone.Then why are you here, with me?Youve already pursued me across this entire island.Do what you came here to do, then leave.He wants to kiss me, I think.And I want to let him.Then the word is there again, flashing in my head: prohibited.I am sick of prohibited.Prohibited from leaving the island, prohibited from asking questions.Prohibited from fighting or laughing too loud or even breathing in a natural manner.Perhaps its the whole pointless evening or the knowledge that, with each passing minute, my chances for a cohabitant grow slimmer.Perhaps its because I dont care.I cant do this, he says, almost to himself.His confidence turns to worry.Hes backing away from me, more air between us with each passing second.For once, I tell myself, I will do exactly what I want.My mind goes blank, just as I have been taught, my final thought being that this isnt the use of training Master had intended.I rush forward and his lips are on mine, his kiss somehow soft and hard in the very same moment.Im buzzing all over.I dont want to come up for breath.Then Im melting.This surprises me, having never imagined any part of myself to be frozen.The more he pulls away, the more I draw him close.Our mouths part wider and our kisses multiply.Then theres something small and round rolling around in my mouth.Something that he pushed in with his tongue.It rolls into my mouth and hes now pulled away, his eyes wideningwith horror?Mine must be doing the same.Whatever it is, its caught at the back of my throat and I feel as if I might choke.Spit it out!he says.Im confused, but I do it and a tiny white pearl lands at my feet.Its a pill, I think.My mouth is impossibly bitter, so I spit again, and with it comes rushing too much anger.What was that?!Veda rears up with a protective neigh, and the Young Man stumbles backward.Kane.What did you just do?I changed my mind, he says.I didnt want to go through with it ...but then you kissed me....I reach for my zinger, but of course its not there.Hardly debut appropriate.Start making sense, I say.Im sorry, he says, the words growing thick in his mouth.As much as I wish it, it wasnt me who did this to him.His body grows unsteady and his emotions are blunted.Hes not sure what he thinks, and neither am I.   His eyes have trouble remaining focused and the color drains from his face.Im so sorry ...to spoil your special day.His palms clutch his temples, and he shakes his head to clear away the confusion, but its not working.I grab him, Im so angry.Did you just try to kill me?Half a pill dissolves at my feet, the rest of its poison flowing through my would be assassins veins.Did he hold it in his mouth too long?He collapses in my arms, falling forward, and I brace myself to catch his dead weight.Blood drips from his nose onto my dress.I was never going to wear this again anyway.This day is probably best to be forgotten.He looks up at me, almost gone, his eyes giving a final flicker of recognition.He smiles, his bloody lip curling upward.Livia, he says softly.His eyes go blank.His body shudders.I mean, someone should try to save him, I just dont think thats me.Then someone else is shouting my name and its Waslo standing outside the stable.He stares at us, trying to make sense of the chaos before him.Thats when I see the security team hired especially for my debut.They rush toward me in their PCF uniforms, blasters in hand, and I look around, expecting to see more assassins lurking in the eaves.Just who are they protecting me from?Step away from him, one bellows, Veda rearing up and bellowing right along with him.Facedown!the PCF scream at him.Hands on your back!Dont move!When he doesnt respond, they pull him from my arms, hurling his limp body to the ground.They surround him, and Waslo takes my hand and pulls me away.Theyre beating this boy, and once more I cant get a read on him.I scream again and again for them to stop.Hes completely and utterly emotionless.Hes unconscious as they continue to hit him.At least hes no longer feeling any more pain I hope.13           Two Weeks Following Apprenticeship   Lex   A girl.Shes air, I can tell, but some sort of weird fringe group, with the way her hairs tangled and her dress recalls some Rock Bottom scav.She doesnt even have shoes.This doesnt seem important when you consider the white creature behind hera horse, but not an Archive kind, even though it kind of is that, too.Except this ones real as this memory, massive and the purest white I could ever image.Not synth white.Pure white.You can get anything in the Upper Levels, I guess.This way of life Im still trying to process.Every time Kane or the airgirl speak, all I get is buzzzzzzz, the audiofeeds all jacked, but I suspect Cassina wants it this way.Something bad is going to happen.I know it.But I cant tear my eyes away.The girl pretends to ignore Kane.She brushes the horse and I see her playing games, just like Cassina does.Its so transparently obvious.Kane puts his hand to his lips.A yawn?I cant be sure.The girl turns back to him.Shes got an expression like shes doing him a favor.Lowering herself to offer a few words.Just like an airgirl.But then she attacks him, right as hes backing away.Hes not himself.I have to help him.My reflexes kick in and I bash against the enforcement wall and am reminded Im just an observer.By then I see theyre kissing.Kane and the girl are kissing, and I feel foolish for rushing in.My training got the better of me.My emotions did, too.I dont know why, but Im even angrier than if shed have punched him.Kanes words pop into my head.My first kiss with someone I care about.I look at the girl.She must be the second.He knew this assignment was coming.Hes known about this for a long time.Was she on his mind when he was with me?Am I on his mind when hes with her?He breaks the kiss.Yells at her.Probably for throwing herself on him.Thats when she spits on him.Forget not caring for airgirl.Hate is a better word.Shes yelling now.Ferocious.Not so great with rejection, I guess.Now shes pulling back her arm....Everything goes dim.I figure some glitch is going to boot me out, but then theres a flash and the girls holding Kane in her outstretched arms.Like he isnt worthy of her touch.Looks down at him with disgust.His eyes are closed, his body lifeless.And thats when PCF officers surround Kane and start kicking his already broken body.They dont touch her.I cant either.Not right now, but shes out there somewhere.Are they just going to pummel him until hes dead?Someone is holding the girl back.Her father?Hes not PCF, thats for sure.Hes fancy, more put together than her.She tries to run toward Kane, but the guy has her good.She struggles against him, wanting back in on the action.But its over already.The PCF step back, winded from swinging clubs against a defenseless kid.Great work, guys.My list of people to hate is growing.They move aside, and if you didnt know it was a human lying there at their feet, you wouldnt be able to tell.Until he twitches, and you know theres still life, know that hes got more fight in him than everyone on that pathetic island.I might puke.It feels like I have to, but my body just wont let me.The memory of the ball and Kanes beating lingers in a bad way and I might just heave all kinds of reality over this Archive access room.She set me up.I stepped right into her trap ...Though I asked for this, I really did.Cassinas still standing there.She just had to stick around to see me this way.She takes the chip from my wrist and Im too sick to resist.I cant let anyone know where you got this from, she says.I squeeze my eyes shut, but all it does is jog my memory, which is the last thing I need.Plugged into a restricted archive, all I could do was stand apart from it and bear witness to Kanes new life without me.I couldnt yell at him or warn him or even beg him to stop.All I could do was watch and see him with someone else, then be beaten so savagely that I cant believe hes still alive.The nausea begins to pass as the memory fades.Cassina looks calm, but shes keeping her distance.That was a dirty trick.Id be all over her if I didnt need her in a condition where she could still talk.Hes alive, I say, not allowing myself to consider any other option.He could be.Thats all I know.Whered they take him?With the rest of the traitors and dissidents.Youre SpecOps.You have access to all sorts of secret knowledge.Her eyes dart to the fist Im making.I lack discipline.I lack self control.I lack satisfaction and answers.Im closer to her now, trying to keep my voice from exploding.Is it real?She circles away and puts distance between us.As you and me.Perhaps, in the past, Ive understated how important I am.The man in the videofeed, the one wearing the mark of the Independent High Council, is my father.He has an island, bigger than that.Thats where I was born.Well, if youre so important, why was your father with her?And whyre you down here?Shes silent for a moment.Ive hurt her.Even she doesnt know the answer.Kane trespassed, impersonated a Proper Young Man, and then attempted to assassinate that debutee.But he failed, as was plainly apparent.More of an artist than a killer, our Kane.Our Kane.Kanes not a killer.Not for a lack of trying, she says.And PCF, were they trying to kill him?Is it normal for them to attend fancy balls?Of course.Do you know what wouldve happened if they werent there?Cant say Im civilized enough to know the answer.She swings around.What exactly are you implying?Those men sure looked like they were listening to that man you say is your father.I keep my voice measured, my face calm.But with each word, Im moving steadily closer to her.I mean, he was right there with them.He was watching.He was the host.As host, did he invite Kane?My father had nothing to do with this!Even he wouldnt get in the way of PCF.He saved Livia Cosmos life!Livia Cosmo.At least I have a name.How would you even know?I say.Shes starting to get worried, I can see it on her face.No way Kane was acting alone.He told me he had a secret assignment.Who gave the orders?I mean, why kill her?Shes crazy, perhaps, but not exactly old enough to be an enemy of the Indrithian state.She shakes her head.She hasnt bothered to ask herself these questions.Shes baiting me.As to that, I have no idea.Think, I say.You didnt graduate just so you could stop using your head.We werent brainwashed.She turns her back on me, but only I say when were finished.
