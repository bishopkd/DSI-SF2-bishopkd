He just wanted information.We didnt tell him anything, so he gave us an ultimatum.What?Ilene asked.Tomorrow hes going to come back for me.If I dont tell him what he wants, hes going to start interrogating the crew.Hell perform brain surgery to enable us to suffer pain, and then torture us until somebody tells him how to get out of here.Then well all die.Marc groaned in anguish as he buried his face his hands.What have I done?Marc, Helena said hesitantly.I think I may have found a way out of here,  What?he asked in amazement.Do you see that panel above the water dispenser?she asked, pointing to it.Its an interface with this ship.Im guessing the Scraumudi use it as a manual backup for when their telepathic interface is down.When I touched it, I could access the ships nervous system.Thats impossible, Drkp claimed.Those panels are designed so that only Scraumudi can use them.Otherwise they obviously wouldnt have put such a vulnerability in a prison cell.But Im clairvoyant, so is it possible thats why I can read it?Helena asked.Isnt it possible thats why they put that tin foil hat on you?I suppose its possible, Drkp replied.I and every other Alluran who have been prisoners of the Scraumudi have borne these, so our psionic powers were useless.We were never able to study any of their ships in detail.They always self destructed when captured.But tell me, what happened when you touched the panel?I was able to read information from the ships database, Helena replied.I know the layout of this ship now.Were on the same deck as the airlock.If we can get out of the cell and go right down the corridor for a hundred and some meters wed be back on the Deity.Halfway between the airlock and us is the door to an enormous bay where everyone else is being kept.Are they okay?Marc asked desperately.I dont know, Helena replied sadly.Theyre not under surveillance.The rooms intended purpose might have been a cargo bay.Im starting to think this ship was never meant to take on prisoners.You may be right, Drkp stated.They have had no need of marauding vessels for ten thousand years, and so may have designed their ships to serve other functions.Levanoch means to stage a coup dtat against Nakhash once he has the ability to free the Scraumudi.Perhaps he feared that commissioning a warship would arouse suspicion.It doesnt matter why the ship is as it is, Marc insisted.Just tell me how does this information help us?About six hundred meters from here theres a shaft of some sort that leads up to this ships brain, the brain Drkp told us about, Helena continued.Drkp, you said that if we take that brain out well sever the Scraumudis telepathic interface with the ship, and the shock of that would render them all unconscious for at least ten minutes, right?Yes, Drkp replied softly, running over scenarios in his head.We would be able to escape.But how could we possibly reach the brain without being caught?Thats another piece of good news.Im pretty sure Ive learned how to deactivate your tinfoil hat, Helena informed him.If I can shut it off, you can use your telekinesis to bust us out of here.One of us takes the brain out and then runs like hell back here, while we free the rest of the crew.We get back on the Deity as quickly as possible, blast our way out of the hangar and go to the first wormhole we can find and try to invert it, Helena proposed.Hold on.I cant help but notice a couple of problems with your plan, Ilene said.First of all, if we do get out of this cell, how do we get to the brain without being caught?I dont think the Wookie prisoner trick would work under these circumstances.And second, if we do get to the brain, how do we kill it?There are two armed guards right outside the door.Drkp can easily neutralize them, and we can take their weapons.Helena suggested.Hmmm.If we were to escape from this cell, The Scraumudi would be far more concerned about me then the rest of you.I think it would be best if I stood guard by the airlock to protect the crew while they evacuate, Drkp said.Theyll be aware that you three have also escaped, but so long as I prove sufficiently distracting they wont bother with you.They wont know what youre trying to do.Youll just be a few puny Humans scurrying around while one of their most ancient and powerful enemies is tearing up their ship.But the Deity is crawling with Scraumudi.How can we retake the ship?Marc asked.I believe I have taken an appropriate precaution, Drkp said with a smirk.You recall that I said the Scraumudi have extremely sensitive hearing?Since those aboard the Deity now are not soldiers but scientists, theyre unlikely wearing any sound guards.I programmed the com system to blare a high frequency, ultrasonic siren if any Humans or myself were to re enter the Deity.You mean, like a dog whistle?Ilene asked in disbelief.Drkp was silent for a moment.Somewhat similar, perhaps, he admitted.But it should be sufficiently debilitating to the Scraumudi to allow us to retake the ship.Ilene nodded reluctantly.She turned back to Helena.All right, say we get out of this cell.How do we get to that brain?she asked.Theres a hatch, about twenty meters down the hall on the left, Helena explained.It opens into a crawlspace.There shouldnt be anyone in there.Even though the Scraumudi will be focused on getting Drkp, its probably best if you avoid them as much as possible.If you can make it into the crawlspace without being caught you should be able to make it all the way to the brain.Once youre in go right, and turn right at every junction.At the third junction theyll be a vertical shaft.Crawl up it, and youll be in the control room.The control room will definitely be manned, Drkp stated.Youll need to neutralize the technicians quickly.The brain itself will be quite obvious.Its very large, and it will be floating in a transparent tank in the center of the room.Dont let its size deter you; it is not Sapient.Its no more self aware than an insect.Its only so big because it has such a massive body to control.Shoot it with the rifle as well.You may have to adjust the settings before you find one that works.Once you kill the brain, go back down the shaft, but this time go into the main corridor.You wont have to worry about being caught.Run back down it as fast as you can.Helena told them.Understood, Marc said.So, our plan is to deactivate Drkps tinfoil hat so that he can break us out of here.He takes out the guards then heads for the bay where the rest of the crew is being held.He watches their six as they re board the Deity.While the Scraumudi are busy with him, one of us takes one of the rifles from the guards and heads to the control room to destroy the ships brain, allowing us to escape.They nodded in agreement.So which one of us should try to head for the control room?Helena asked.I will, Marc replied immediately.I took a sacred oath to protect the lives of my crew, even if it means giving my own life.If anyones caught out there trying to sabotage the ship, Levanoch will not have any mercy upon them.Im not going to let any of you take that risk.Its my responsibility to ensure that none of you will die by the fell hand of Levanoch.And its my responsibility to make sure you dont do anything stupid or crazy, Ilene reminded him.Im coming to.Blades no, Marc told her.Marc, you cant go alone, Helena insisted.If you wont take her, then I should go with you.Absolutely not!Marc commanded.Im clairvoyant!I can be useful, and shes injured!she claimed.Im your second in command, Ilene stated.Marc, you know youre more likely to succeed if you bring someone with you, especially if that persons me.My wrist isnt that bad anyway.I just like whining to annoy people.You dont want to risk a Scraumudi messing up Helenas hot bod dya?Marc was pensive for a moment, but then nodded at her.Okay, you and I will make an attempt to destroy the brain, he said.Drkp, if we succeed will you be able to tell?Immediately.The effects will be obvious, he replied.Good.As soon as we do, well do exactly what Helena said, Marc instructed.Ilene and I will get back here as soon as we can, and you two get everyone back on the Deity and make sure everyone whos able goes to their posts.Tell everyone that Arachnid recruited to find any weapons and restraints they can on the Deity and then do a deck by deck search.Tell them to take the Scraumudi alive if they can and throw them into Quarantine.Well figure out what to do with them later.He looked at Ilene, his eyes filled with deep concern.Blades, are you sure you want to come with me?he asked softly.Marc, were about to go crawling through the bowels, in the most literal sense of the word, of a colossal bioship, so that we can kill a giant brain and knock out a ship load of immortal giant worms, she said.Theres no way I can turn down doing something that is so utterly fucked up.Marc nodded with a gracious smile.Okay.Helena, please give me your scanner.I might need it.he said.She knelt down beside him and tentatively handed him the scanner, then leaned in to kiss him gently.I wont go back to the Deity until you come back, she promised him.But if I dont come back Marc began.Then Im going to come and get you, she said.And you cant talk me out of it.If you dont leave then I dont leave.Its that simple.Marc nodded reluctantly.I love you, and I wont make you venture into a vast ship full of angry Scraumudi just to find my dead body.Ill come back, he assured her.As much as its always been my dream to be cannon fodder in some convoluted escape attempt, we still have to get out of this cell, Ilene reminded them.Helena nodded.She stood behind Drkp and looked at the small display on the back of the tin foil.Okay.Im pretty sure I can shut this off without killing you, she said meekly.He cocked his head towards her.Pretty sure?Five      Locked within the massive dungeon of a hideously alien ship with no hope of escape, deprived of all but the most essential of necessities, lying upon a floor of pulsating living flesh, Sophie cried out in orgasm.She didnt even know where she was.Both she and her mother had turned their euphoria patches up to maximum as soon as Ilene had made her announcement about being sucked into the wormhole.The sensation of bliss overwhelmed their other senses, and they had lost all perception of time.They knew that their patches lasted twenty four hours, but those could have been replaced by a jellybot or even a person.Sophie was aware that she was having intercourse with Brock, and had done so several times since she had blissed out.When she wasnt having sex, she was masturbating.She was on an orgasm binge, and that was all she cared about.Brock would give her water and broth to replenish her, and clean up her bodily waste, while she remained in perpetual orgasm until her body could take no more.No memory of the past or thought of the future entered her conscious mind when she was in this state.All she was conscious of was the all consuming pleasure.Chika was the same, only without a sexual partner, so she masturbated continuously.As she writhed in waves of ecstasy, Sook yin did her best to clean up her feces.Arachnid strolled over to the corner where the pair had been isolated.Crossing her arms, she leaned against the wall and looked down at Sook yin with concern.You dont have to do that babe, she said.If she wants to get so blissed out that she cant go to the bathroom thats her problem.Its not sanitary, Sook yin said.Im responsible for the health of everyone in here.I cant let this place become a toilet.Youve been working constantly since we got in here, Arachnid said.No ones in immediate danger anymore thanks to you.You deserve a break.You deserve orgasmic bliss as much as these euphoria junkies do.Lets go find Randi and have some fun.Not with so many people around, Sook yin told her.What if we never get out of here?Are you never going to have sex again?Arachnid asked her.Privacy is a luxury.Intimacy is a necessity.Shouldnt you be trying to get us out of here?Sook yin asked annoyed.What can I do?Arachnid asked, throwing up her hands.They took my weapons, they took my armour, and the doors impenetrable.What am I supposed to do?Sook yin gave her an irritated glare.I am not having sex in this place, she said firmly.If you ever want to sleep with me again, you will get us out of here.Well, thats a pretty decent incentive, she sighed.Youre right.I guess I have a job to do.Ill go talk with the other Civic Guards.Maybe well be able to think of something.Here, take this with you, Sook yin requested, handing her a bowl of shit.Arachnid winced in disgust, but took it over to the floor drain.Levanoch attempted to humble himself as he stood before the shimmering visage of the Warlord Nakhash.In reality Levanoch was actually taller than his lord, but the projection was larger than life size and dwarfed him.He bowed in an insincere display of respect.You requested an audience Sire?Levanoch asked.Tell me more of the ship youve captured, Nakhash instructed.What is the nature of the quarantine?Theyre carrying an experimental biological weapon, Levanoch claimed.Its a virus, designed to instantly mutate to infect any living thing.Its very deadly.When we attacked their ship, the virus was accidentally released.Its inert at the moment, but we have no idea what activates it.My scientists are aboard the vessel now, investigating.Until we determine what triggers the virus we cant risk spreading it.My ship and my crew cannot come into contact with anyone else.No one is to come near my vessel.Is that clear?This vessel youve captured, what race built it?Nakhash asked.Humans, Sire, Levanoch replied.Nakhash was silent for a moment.I do not recall them, he said at length.Theyre the race who dwelt nearest to the world the Allura settled, Levanoch reminded him.They look much alike as well.Yes, now I remember, Nakhash said.They built the ship thats now in your possession?Yes Sire.I was aware that they were now starfarers, but I didnt know they could build ships capable of reaching our dust cloud.Why did you not tell me of this in your reports?Sire, the information we receive from the outside Universe is vast.Much of it is irrelevant or fictional.Almost all of it is discarded before we find anything important enough to report to you.I did not think that Human progress was of any consequence.The Humans are not at war at the moment, correct?Nakhash asked.I dont believe so Sire, Levanoch replied.Why then would they create such a horrific weapon?Nakhash demanded suspiciously.Ive been wondering that myself, Levanoch told him, showing no sign of deception.We do know they are in league with the Allura.Perhaps it was them who sent the Humans to destroy us.After ten thousand years?Nakhash asked.Why now?Perhaps theyve become aware that we now have the ability to monitor the outside Universe, and fear we are plotting something, Levanoch suggested.Of course.It was always a matter of time before they found out, Nakhash said.I want a report on that virus within the hour and I want to know why the Humans have it.Stop at nothing until youve obtained the truth.Levanoch smiled and bowed humbly.Of course Sire, he said.He sighed with relief when the projection vanished.Do you believe he suspects you plan to overthrow him?Amarantos asked.Yes, but no more than he has at any other point over the last fifteen thousand years, Levanoch replied.But I think the thought of the Allura destroying us has pushed his fear of me from his mind; at least for now.Im surprised he didnt ask about the wormhole the Deity almost inverted, Amarantos said.Oh hes quite unaware of that, Levanoch assured him.I had an operative rig the sensor gird that monitors the Boundary.It did not detect anything out of the ordinary yesterday.Youre most cunning Sire.When you are our leader Ive no doubt that we will rapidly ascend to one of the mightiest races in the Heavens, Amarantos said.Levanoch glared at him suspiciously.What is it?You only flatter me when you have bad news, he claimed.Lets hear it.It may be nothing, Amarantos said nervously.Its just that I received a report of an unregistered user opening the ships database.Glitches like that happen all the time, Levanoch scoffed.Stray nerve impulses trigger the interfaces and open random files.You know that.I do Sire, but this one happened to originate within the cell holding the Alluran, Amarantos explained.That could just be a coincidence, Levanoch claimed at length.And only moments later that same interface was activated again, by an unregistered user, Amarantos added.Levanoch was silent for moment.That is a cause for concern, he admitted.You dont think the Alluran could have done it do you?Amarantos asked quietly.No, its impossible!Not when hes wearing his Crown, Levanoch claimed.But its been ten thousand years!What if theyve developed new methods of countering them?Amarantos asked.And what do we know of these Humans?How can we be certain that it wasnt one of them?Dont be daft!Only a powerful psychic could have tricked the interface into thinking they were a Scraumudi, Levanoch said.And no Human qualifies as a powerful psychic, not even that female you had thrown in with the Alluran.And if Humans did have the ability to use our interfaces than why hasnt anyone in the Prison Bay done so?Well somebody did it!Amarantos insisted.It could even have been one of us.Somebody may be working for Nakhash.Perhaps he tried to frame what he did on the Alluran.That may be the most likely, Levanoch conceded.I will go and investigate.You make certain we have a report to give Nakhash by the end of the hour.Understood?Amarantos nodded.Yes Sire, he replied.Trying to conceal his fear, Levanoch quickly slithered out of the room.If anyone of his own crew had done anything to sabotage his plans of conquest, he knew there would be at least one more Scraumudi who wouldnt live forever.Got it!Helena said softly.The tinfoil hat immediately dropt to the ground, leaving a pair of small green wounds on Drkps temples.Drkp let out a sigh of relief, and slowly rose to his full height.Drkp?Are you all right?Helena asked.Much better, thank you, he replied.He took a deep breath and positioned himself into a battle stance.Please step away from the door, he said to Marc and Ilene.They immediately backed away.With a singular telekinetic blast, the door was blown off.A hideous, screeching klaxon instantly started blaring throughout the ship.The two guards by the door were stunned only for a second.They quickly aimed their rifles at him, but before they could shoot their blue hearts exploded inside their chests, and their bodies crumpled to the ground.Drkp picked up their rifles and handed one to Ilene.You two get to the brain.Helena, youre with me!
