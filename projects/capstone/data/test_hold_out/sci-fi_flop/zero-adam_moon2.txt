The alien regarded her quizzically until she retook her seat.It turned back to them and said, Weve never before entrusted such a unique privilege to your people.No alien creature has ever stepped foot on a Beetar warship.The two who get selected are truly blessed individuals.The mention of a warship confused Jack.If these aliens were peace loving, why did they have warships?Of course he was just being nave.Peace couldnt be forced upon others without backing it up with a threat of some kind.He wasnt sure if he wanted to get warship duty or not.He still didnt know if it was preferable to the other available duties.The idea of being surrounded by dozens or even hundreds of aliens like Quiss made him nervous.Quiss said, Now that you know the state of this section of the galaxy, lets get your training underway.Youll be transported to Epigog 31 for testing.Good luck to each of you.I look forward to working with you in the future.With that, Quiss nodded awkwardly to pants suit and then waited for Henshaw to escort him from the room.The pants suit lady was giddy when she addressed the room.This is a turning point in history.I hope you understand the significance of what just transpired here today.Two of you lucky bastards will get to board a bonafide Beetar warship.Lets hope there are two recruits here who are up to the task.Lets get you prepped to go landside.Hopeful she wouldnt shut him down for interrupting, Jack asked, How long does training last?Some of you will make it through training faster than others.I heard of one recruit who made it through in less than two weeks, Earth time, but most need at least a month.A few washouts fail to make the cut at all, but thats very rare.I doubt anyone in this room will fail training.Otherwise, training will help us place you in a vocation for the duration of your physical therapy.But be ready to be tested to your limits.Just remember what the rewards are and youll do fine.Jack couldnt for the life of him figure out what those rewards were unless she was still referring to the warship duty.Then again, the ultimate reward for him was getting a perfectly healthy body back at some point in the future.That mustve been what she meant, but he was so overwhelmed by what had transpired that hed lost sight of it.He wanted nothing more than to gaze upon his human body, because he had a feeling he wouldnt be seeing it again for a long time.And when he finally did get reunited with it, he suspected hed be changed in fundamental ways.He cursed Doctor Jacobs under his breath.Jacobs mustve known about the Beetars.He must have known that hed be interred inside a robot while his body healed.Jack understood why hed kept that information to himself, because if hed been told, he might not have agreed to participate.When Pants suit was done with her speech, she left them without saying goodbye.The room felt empty without her.Technically, she had been the only human being in the room, so that made sense.Jack turned around to face the other mechs.Is one of you Stacey?It hardly mattered in the grand scheme of things, but he suddenly had a growing urge to connect with someone else.A blue and silver mech waved its hand in the air and split the crowd to stand beside him.She said, This is a total mind job, huh?He nodded, thankful she wasnt one of the robots that had got shut off.An hour ago I had no idea aliens existed or that they were our longtime friends.It seems like a one sided friendship to me.They order and we obey.He looked at her with genuine concern.We have no choice in any of this, so itll probably be better if you get used to it.She nodded her mammoth head and said, Youre probably right.I dont know enough about any of this to judge them yet.He noticed a few other mechs cozying together, no doubt trying to make one last connection before their world got flipped on its head.Only then did he notice Doctor Henshaw standing before them.He must have slipped back inside silently.He said, A transport is being prepped just now.Follow me.If Jack had a heart it would have been tripping along at a mile a minute.If he had bones they wouldve quaked.He wanted to tell Henshaw he wasnt going.He wanted to curl up in a comfortable bed and shut his eyes to this new, strange, reality he suddenly found himself in.Instead he followed the crowd as it surged after Henshaw towards the transport to Epigog 31.Henshaw fastened each of them to the wall inside the transport ship.In reality, the thing looked more like a cargo crate than a ship, but Jack assumed there was no need for frills when the payload was technically non organic.Henshaw gave a short speech about how lucky they were, and about all the weird and wonderful things theyd see that few humans had seen before.Then he left the transport, closing it up behind him.Jack started to worry, but that was fleeting, because as soon as the interior lights dimmed from the power gulp necessary to start the ship, he felt a pressure in the middle of his back and his consciousness turned off.He awoke to a human face.The face belonged to a man in his mid fifties.He had many wrinkles and deep set blue eyes.Older women would have found him handsome.He backed up and said, This is Epigog 31, son.Take as much time as you need to adjust, then Ill uncouple you from your restraints.Jack nodded his big stupid metal head and the guy moved on to the mammoth mech beside him, saying the exact same thing.He could see sunlight streaming through the hatch in the back of the ship, and he could smell the hot air wafting inside.He had no idea why he needed a sense of smell, but he appreciated it at that moment.The guy whod woken him stood in the center of the ship.He addressed the opposite wall.Whos ready to come down?When heads nodded, he unlatched them from their secured mounts and pointed towards the back hatch.They obediently traipsed off in that direction, no doubt nervous or even petrified.None of them knew what training would involve.Would it be dangerous?Could they die?A few scared mechs remained on that wall when he turned around and asked Jacks wall who was ready to get started.Jack nodded first, so he got unhooked.He looked around for Stacey, but it was impossible to tell which one she was.Then the old dude impatiently put a hand on him and pointed towards the back of the ship.Jack nodded again and walked that way.A man and a woman were outside the hatch.They beckoned to him, so he walked down the steel ramp and right up to them.They were ankle deep in a desert, brown and tan and dry as a bone.The moon hed been orbiting was in full view in the bright sunny sky.The air smelled sterile.It had been a long time since hed felt the sun on him without worrying about cancer or heat stroke, but this time the sun was gentle and he had no skin for it to attack.The woman said, Get out of the damn way, recruit.Youre not the only one getting off of this transport.The guy said, Get in line with the rest, stupid.Jack had been so preoccupied with the sky and the weather that hed barely noticed the cluster of confused mechs huddled behind the two humans.He walked towards them, partly for companionship but mainly so the dickheads would stop berating him.He approached the mechs and then turned around to watch the rest depart the transport ship.A masculine voice whispered from behind.How are we supposed to train in the damn desert?It was a question directed at no one in general, so no one answered.A blue robot emerged from the ship and walked right past the two agitated greeters.It took up a place beside him and said, Its me, Stacey.Are you Jack?Howd you know?I guessed.She pointed her metal finger at her chest plate and then ripped a deep scratch in the surface of the metal with astonishing ease.Now youll know me when you see me.Then she put the same finger on his metal chest plate and etched a similar groove into it.Now Ill be able to tell you from the rest.The human greeters must have heard the screeching of metal on metal, and scolded her in front of everyone.Do not damage Securacell property.This is a final warning to all of you.Those units are prototypes, and as such theyre considered priceless.Do I make myself clear?Staceys mouth transformed into a smile which, to that point, Jack didnt know they could do.She said, It wont happen again.Im sorry.When the guy turned his attentions back to the hatch of the ship, she elbowed him in the side and smirked.The faces of the robotic units were strangely malleable and human like; at least in that they had a mouth right around where a human mouth should be, and eyes and ears that closely resembled those of a human.He had no idea why that was important.Maybe it was so they didnt freak out.Maybe it was so theyd never forget their humanity.Or maybe the designers just thought it was a nice aesthetic touch.He was getting bored by the time the final reluctant mech exited the transport ship.It joined them, then the two human greeters parted so the guy whod woken them could face them all.He had a cold detachment to him that wasnt out of place in the sterile desert of an alien planet.He said, Im Commander Delacourt.Welcome to Epigog 31, recruits.Youve already been debriefed about the nature of mankinds place in the universe.I understand how stressful that must have been.But were here to show you your unique place in that universe.This is where it gets serious.This training will test all of you, separating the wheat from the chaff.Training is the only way well know what youre capable of and which assignments to grant each of you.He pointed to his left and said, A lift is coming for us.It will take us a thousand feet below the surface to your new home.A mech to Jacks right asked, Why do we need to go underground?Im kind of claustrophobic.Son, no one here cares about your fears.You will do as youre told and keep your mouth shut.These fine sands on the surface wreak havoc on your bodies.Training up here would cause most of you to shut down after enough time.I trust that this will be the last time I am questioned.From now on you will all do as I say.Do you understand?Delacourt was a dick, but the mech nodded because there was no doubt that he was in control.A rumble in the ground made its way up Jacks thick metal legs.The sound that accompanied it was faint, like a distant engine.Then the sand to their right rose up slowly like a hill growing before their eyes.It fell away in waves, revealing the lift that had disturbed it.The lift was about forty feet long on each side and twenty feet tall.Delacourt and his two minions led the way inside when the big double doors split open.Jack entered first and was immediately jammed into the corner by the other mechs filing in afterwards.He noticed that his head had no clearance from the ceiling of the lift.The human instructors, or whatever they were, got inside a steel cage and it didnt take too long for Jack to figure out why.As the lift filled to capacity, metal scraped on metal and mechs started to shove one another for more space.The steel cage was knocked into twice by lumbering mechs before Delacourt yelled, If everyones in, stop moving.Well be beneath the surface in less than a minute.Then he pressed a button on a handheld device and the sun dimmed as the doors jammed shut.Jack felt the lift descending through the sand.Hed been through a lot in a very short amount of time, but this was the worst.It felt like they were going into the bowels of hell and there was no way out.Only then did he realize why theyd woken them up for this when it wouldve been so much easier to take them below ground and then turn them on: they wanted them to see how secluded they actually were.It wasnt enough that they technically werent even human anymore.They wanted to make sure they knew there was no escape, even as a mind in a machine.The beauty about volunteering for something was that it was easy to back out of it, but now they were finding out that wasnt the case for them.They were in this until they were told otherwise.It was a dark certainty.The doors slid open when they bottomed out, and before them was nothing but black, pocked here and there with inadequate strings of lights that seemed to only emphasize how dark the cavern was.Delacourt yelled at them to exit the elevator when they dawdled too long.He and his two companions filed out after them and then led the way down the labyrinthine corridors.The rough hewn rock walls were damp, which surprised Jack, since they were under a desert, but he understood his surprise was rooted in an inadequate understanding of geology.Just because all was barren above didnt mean it had always been that way.For all he knew the dampness couldve come from a monsoon that had happened on the surface a million years ago.They reached a heavy blast door at the end of the corridor and Delacourt made a show of slowly opening it.He walked through and waited for the rest of them to join him.Through that door was another world.There was gunfire all around them.Explosions lit up the room, echoing off the walls.There was a war between robots going on behind the blast doors, in a huge room as big as a sports stadium, with bright lights illuminating it.Three of his fellow mechs hit the dirt defensively.Stacey was one of them.Jack noticed that the others had crouched reflexively.So he wouldnt be left out, he bent his knees and took up a defensive position too.Delacourt smiled and yelled over the commotion, Good.Youve all passed the preliminary test.The warfare slowed to a halt and the din became silence.Then the mechs that had just been attacking one another simply wandered off through three sets of doors set into the walls of the stadium sized room.Delacourt waited for the last of them to go and then continued, We test interface compatibility down here.We want to find out how well your minds have integrated with the bodies they gave you.The robotic bodies are set to go on the defensive when an attack is perceived, so we have the graduating class conduct a virtual attack to test the newly arrived for compatibility issues.At the end of your training, youll be the ones administering this test on a new group.Jack stood fully erect and the others either got back to their feet or stood to attention.At least the air was far less harsh in here.Jack didnt need to breathe, but his mech body could taste its superior quality through whichever sensors did that for him.Delacourt explained further, Your human minds could have overridden the built in command to defend yourselves.Had you done so, you wouldve been reconditioned.You need to be able to work with the superior tech we supplied you, but that is not always the case.You see, sometimes a user fights the basic commands of the body and in the field that can lead to his or her death.There must be a perfect balance between programming and rational decision making.Because each of you reacted appropriately to the perceived danger, you all pass to the next stage.The whole thing seemed childish to Jack.Surely there was an easier way to see if they had integrated fully with their mechanical bodies than to blast a bunch of guns around them.But hed learned something useful too: his new body had a whole set of basic commands that he had little control over.The realization unnerved him.Could he trust the subcommands with his life when the time came?He didnt even know if he could trust them to get him through training.Worse, his body hadnt commanded him to take up a defensive posture like Delacourt thought.He had consciously decided to bend his knees and join the others in their defensive stances; his programming hadnt forced it upon him.If he wanted to avoid reconditioning, he knew he have to fake the appropriate responses if or when his mechanical body failed him again.Delacourt pointed right at him and said to one of his helpers, That one had the slowest reaction time.Make a note of it.The others looked at Jack like he was the puny kid in gym class or the dumb one at a spelling bee.But did his lack of a reaction mean they were any better than he was?Did it mean his mech was weak or that his mind was too powerful to be subverted?He already knew the answer: his body was defective.If he could hide that from everyone he might just make it through training.One of the guys next to him asked a question that Jack was ashamed to admit he hadnt thought about: Why do human minds need to be inside of these things if theyre already programmed?Delacourt took a deep breath.Jack couldve sworn he was silently counting to ten to avoid losing his temper.They work optimally with our consciousnesses running them.Alone, they are lumbering mindless hunks of crap, but with human minds driving them they are capable of extraordinary feats.As you saw, each of you reacted differently under duress.The mechs would have all done the exact same things as each other had your minds not been controlling them.Predictability is our enemy.A foe could second guess a mindless robot and defeat him.The guy nodded, but Jack wasnt sure he got the answer he wanted.Jack thought he wanted Delacourt to say something like: Huh.I never thought of it that way.We dont need you after all.Youre free to go.Delacourt motioned to his two companions beside him.These are your new training officers.They are Sergeants Davis and Hildebrandt.Davis was the male and Hildebrandt his female counterpart.Both of them looked like assholes, but Jack was hopeful that was all for show.Davis stepped forward and screamed at one of the mechs, Whats your name, recruit?The mech said, Stephen Simpson, sir, in a trembling synthesized voice.Davis got right in his face and yelled, Wrong!You have no name down in the pit.Down here you go by a number only.Youll be assigned numbers and answer only to your number.Do you get me?Yes sir.Whats my number then?Hildebrandt stepped up to join Davis.She yelled, You are a big fat zero until we assign you a more appropriate number.Jack was hating the goddamn place more and more.Davis and Hildebrandt puffed their chests out and screamed some more until they were reasonably certain they were all appropriately terrified, then they calmed down as if on cue.It was a dog and pony show and they all knew it, but none of them wanted to step out and confront them with it because theyd probably just escalate their verbal abuse to drive their point home.Or worse than that, it might escalate into violence.Of course, any one of the mechs could probably kill either of them with a well placed bonk to the top of the head, but none of them wanted to test that theory.They werent murderers.When he caught his breath, Davis said serenely, Follow us to your new quarters.Their quarters turned out to be a communal barracks with no amenities.No beds or bathrooms.No entertainment either except for a few board games.Jack knew they didnt need much, like a toilet or a bed, but to see their absence struck himhe was a robot with no needs.Hildebrandt said, Today you should take some time to grieve for those youve lost.Get it out of your system because tomorrow is a new chapter in each of your lives.Jack hadnt spent any time grieving for his long dead dad.His bones wouldve already crumbled by now, being eight hundred years since the last time he saw him.His only hope was that his dad had figured out what happened to him and decided to go into stasis until he returned, but that was an idiotic thought.Not only was stasis dangerous, it was pricey too.Folks of their station didnt even bother daydreaming about frivolities like stasis or off world transport.Jack had achieved both, but in the process had had to lose his freedom.Davis and Hildebrandt showed them their docking stations set into the walls, personally assigned to each mech.They were round ports as big as dinner plates about ten feet up, jutting out a few inches.There, theyd hook up at the end of the day to recharge.Jack wondered what would happen if there was a power surge.He wondered if theyd dream.Once they were given the nickel tour, they were left alone.Jack didnt want to dwell on his dad.As far as he was concerned, hed seen him just yesterday.He was pretty sure most of the others felt the same way about those theyd lost, because no one moped around morosely or broke into oil filled robot tears.Stacey grabbed a box of checkers before anyone else could get to it and laid it down in front of him.She sat down and tried to cross her legs, but they were too thick.She nearly tipped over in her seat, which made him smile.She asked, Do you wanna play?I cant grieve when Im nervous.Jack sat down in front of her and opened the lid.The box and the board and all the pieces were built for their huge hands.The set was three times bigger than normal and made of steel, probably so they didnt accidentally crush any of it.Jack set the pieces on the board and she went first.It was weird for them to suddenly feel so normal when their worlds had become so surreal, but the game grounded them to reality.A fight broke out at the other end of the room that had them spellbound for a few minutes, but it devolved from a shoving match into a battle of name calling until it eventually fizzled out altogether.Jack wondered what wouldve happened had it escalated.Their bodies were formidable and terrifying.They werent adept at controlling them yet, but that might just mean they were even more dangerous.He wondered, too, what would happen if theyd both damaged each others mechs.Would they be reprimanded?Would they be reconditioned, or simply turned off?A male and a female sat beside them, watching their game.At first Jack was annoyed by their presence, but that was because he was a bit antisocial.He knew he had to change his habits, though.He was pretty sure hed need friends here.The guys name was Alex.Hed had an inoperable brain tumor.Jack wasnt surprised to find out that he was as young as he was.Everyone hed seen at the hangar back on Earth had been around his age.The girls name was Jackie, and her story was eerily similar to his own.She had bone cancer; she had a mom, but shed never met her dad; and her brother had died when she was young.It started to dawn on him that they were all young and they wouldnt be missed when they suddenly vanished back on Earth.He was starting to wonder about the legality of what theyd agreed to.He couldnt get the image out of his head of his oncologist crumpling up and tossing away the note he wrote to his dad.Why had he done that?Stacey was far more gregarious with their new friends than he was, so they ended up bonding with her and merely putting up with him.Theyd barely had time to talk or grieve when Davis popped his head around the corner and said, Lights out.Ill help anyone who needs it, but after today youre expected to know how to hook up on your own.Jack watched as Davis helped a mech hook up to his power port.It looked easy enough.He just had to back into it right.As soon as the mech was hooked up, its robot eyes closed and its mouth drooped open.Jack considered putting something inside his mouth as a joke, like all the checkers pieces or a bunch of books, but Davis lingered too long, watching them get acclimated to their new and improved version of sleep.Jack helped Stacey zero in on her port and then he went to his own across the room.He got it right on his first try.His consciousness went black.He dreamt of home and of his oncologist and traveling the stars.He dreamt of Henshaw and Quiss the Beetar alien, and of robots.Thousands of robots.They were armed to the teeth and they were coming after him, covered in wet blood and rough gouges from ancient battles won long ago and far away.They were angry that he was alive.They shot him and torched his skin and clothes as he tried in vain to escape.Every time he thought hed gotten away, there were more of them, each new wave coming after him with a ferocious vigor that he barely understood.He wanted to cry but he didnt have the time.He wanted to ask them why they hated him, but he already knew the answer.He would die because they deemed him unworthy of life.He ran and ran but they never stopped chasing.They hunted him down with such passion that even he started to doubt whether he deserved to live.His eyes fluttered open when the dream became too intense.The room was dark.He had no way to tell how long hed been out, but he was the only one to wake from their induced slumber.The other mechs were still standing upright in place against the walls, eyes closed and heads hung low, charging for tomorrows adventures.He tried to detach from the wall, but it was too hard so he gave up.He waited for the fear to dump from his system, but it didnt work like that.His body used no hormones anymore, so there was no adrenaline dump like he was used to.He just had to wait until he got over the dream.Slowly, his eyes slid shut once more.This time the robots left him alone.The next time his eyes opened, Davis and Hildebrandt were in the barracks with them, and their demeanor had changed.They looked focused and energetic.It made him nervous.He fell from his docking station by an inch and hit the floor with a clang.He wanted to rub his eyes out of habit, but he caught himself in time.The other mechs fell one after the other.They stood and watched Davis and Hildebrandt pacing back and forth, glaring at them like theyd done something wrong.Hildebrandt said, The motion sensors picked up movement in here last night.Did one of you malfunction and power up?Jack held his breathnot really his breath, he had no breath, but he tried anyway.He wasnt about to out himself and be put through reconditioning.He had no idea how long that even took or what it did to the psyche, and he didnt want to know.The truth was he didnt want to be separated from Stacey.She was the only person he even knew.Davis added, Sergeant Hildebrandt and I will be taking shifts at night for the next few days.If the motion sensors trip again, well know right away.You might as well fess up now.Youre in no trouble.Glitches happen, especially in new units.Jack stared across at Stacey for strength, but he couldnt see the identifying chest gouge from so far across the room and he had no idea if it was her or some other female robot.Davis waited an uncomfortably long time in silence and then pointed at the door and said, File out, you goddamn maggots.Welcome to hell!Jack wanted to smirk, but he didnt yet have that kind of control over his facial movements.The place was a joke and so were its residents.Then again, when he walked from the room, he started to reevaluate his recent conclusion.Before them was a line of busted and battered mechs.There mustve been thirty of them and they looked pissed.It reminded him of his dream.Davis stood between them and said to Jacks group, The first to draw his or her weapon to defend themselves moves on to the next stage.You will all be timed and graded.One of the evil robots stepped forward and nodded over his shoulder at the open cavern.Well use the training course.Were using rubber bullets and beanbags, but dont think that means this will be easy.This is going to hurt a lot.The other mechs across from them parted in the middle and the leader pointed through the gap.Run for your lives, cadets!None of them had a clue what Davis meant when he said they had to defend themselves.They didnt have the weapons he thought they had, and Jack didnt see a cache of them just sitting around in a crate in the middle of the training course.But none of that mattered.They were about to be assaulted and they had no choice but to run for cover.Jack was the second one through the gap.He ran towards a dilapidated building, set up specifically for training.There were some rusted shuttle parts, a makeshift area with fabricated walls, and a few big natural boulders, but the buildings offered the most cover.He wasnt the only one of them who thought so either, and soon enough he was joined by others.Stacey was with him.She asked the group in a hushed whisper, Where the hell are the weapons Davis mentioned?A few mammoth shoulders shrugged and Jack said, Maybe they hid them or maybe they dont exist.This is a test.But who knows what theyre testing for?Stacey shook her head.They explained the rules.We defend ourselves with weapons and well pass.I cant work with theories; I can only work with the information I have.She was right, of course.Jack was over thinking it.The walls of the building started to come apart in front of them as the evil mechs took it down with round after round of fire.Jack doubted the walls were made of wood or bamboo or anything else natural, as the world above them looked mostly barren and it was hardly cost effective to transport such material from another planet.But whatever it was made of, it stood no chance against the constant firepower.They knew then that they wouldve been better off taking cover behind a boulder.Theyd effectively cornered themselves between the wall of the cavern and a quickly evaporating wall.A shadow loomed over them.When he looked up he saw one of the evil robots balancing precariously on the wall.It aimed down at them with an oversized shotgun and pulled the trigger.Jack took a blast of rubber to the top of the head.It hurt worse than hed imagined, like getting hit on the head with a hammer.Stacey yelled, Run!Take cover!A couple of the other guys started to shove against the wall to knock it over, or at least unbalance the mech standing on it.Before they had any success, they got boxed in.One of the bad mechs appeared at one end of their escape route.It used a beanbag shotgun that stung like a bitch as it unloaded on them.The victimized mechs started to scream out in pain and fear.Jack couldnt be sure if he was one of the screamers or not, because panic had already started to set in.As one, they turned to the only available escape route, in the opposite direction, and they started to rush that way.Before they were free of their self imposed trap, two enemy mechs blocked the exit and blasted them with beanbags and rubber bullets.Jack thought they were going to be killed.Maybe if he raised his hands and surrendered, or just started to cry, theyd take pity on him.But the notion was foreign now that he was a battle bot from space.He shouldve been able to fight back, or at the very least, escape.Just as his knees started to buckle, his entire vision lit up and his ears rang from increased firepower.But this time it came from his fellow recruits.Somehow theyd all armed themselves.He searched around for the crate or hiding spot where theyd found the weapons, but he couldnt find it.When he stared at Stacey, he noticed her body had changed slightly.A hatch had opened on her hip exactly the size of the pistol in her hand.He cocked his head to the side and saw an even larger hatch had popped out on her other side, running the length of her entire thigh.In her other hand was a rifle.Jack stood in the center of his fellow recruits like a damsel in distress as they protected him with their acquired firearms.Just then, a horn blared that cut through the gunfire.The enemy mechs lowered their weapons and retreated, but the recruits continued to fire just in case.Slowly they eased up on their triggers.Stacey finally holstered her pistol when it was obvious the threat had passed, and said to Jack, Just will your body to give you the means to defend yourself.Its easy if you try.He concentrated with all of his might.He checked his hip, but nothing changed.He really wanted to see his guns and feel their weight in his hands, but he couldnt make it happen.The other recruits started to stare at him.He was the failure.He was the guy holding them back.A few of them gave him advice.One guy said, Just imagine that you already have the gun in your hand.He tried that but nothing changed.A girl said seriously, Pretend youre not a wimp.Just imagine you have the means to help protect us the way we all just protected you.That made him feel like shit.Stacey told her to shut up.She looked at him with concern in her robotic features.He wanted to run away and hide, but he had a feeling that might make him look even more worthless in their eyes.A small figure appeared before them.It was Hildebrandt.The test is over.Follow me.Jack was the only one of their group to fail the test.He could only hope that at least one other recruit had failed, too, so hed have company.They were led away from the crumbling wall of the building to the center of the cavern.Davis was already there with a group of recruits whod found cover elsewhere.They all looked pleased, so Jack was reasonably certain he was the only one of them to fail.Davis had a thick marker in his hand.He went up to Stacey and wrote the number one on her chest plate.You were the first to react to the threat.Your new name is Number One.The look on her face was priceless.She was giddy beyond belief.Davis went from robot to robot, with Hildebrandt helping to direct him with whatever she had written on the clipboard in her hands.He wrote the number two on the next guy, and three on the girl after him.He was up to number twenty two when he got to Jack.Hed come in last.To Jacks utter horror, Davis put the cap back on the marker and walked away without scrawling a number on his chest.Hildebrandt whispered to Jack, You failed to even draw your weapon.Youll progress when we find out why you malfunctioned.Some of his group overheard her.As soon as she walked away, they smirked derisively at him.It was the third lowest point in his life.The first was being diagnosed with inoperable cancer; the second was finding out his dad was dust.Stacey smiled as she sidled over to him.She whispered, None of them know how they did it, really, so dont beat yourself up because you couldnt figure it out.He appreciated her comforting words, but they didnt alleviate the dread in his heart.He might have to go for reconditioning now.Davis said to the group, Youll find that now that combat simulations are over, you will not be able to access your weapons, so dont even try to become gunslingers when were out of sight.Youll be wasting your time.Good work, everyone.Hildebrandt added, We need you to recharge for the next test, so head back to your barracks and get a power nap in.Well fetch you when its time to begin.Jack started to follow after his fellow recruits when Davis tapped him on the back.He turned around and Davis asked, Where the hell do you think youre going?You dont get to move on to the next test.Come with me.We need to find out whats wrong with you.Stacey looked back as Davis led him in the opposite direction.As he lumbered along after Davis he couldnt help but wonder if this was all worth it.When he got through training and finished up his tour for the corporation and the Beetars, and finally got his newly healed body back, what kind of world would he find himself in?Everything he knew was dead and buried eight hundred years ago.If he went back to Earth, it would be another eight hundred years before he could get there.It seemed like a lot of work to earn a life that might not be worth living.Of course, if theyd put number one on his chest, he would probably feel very different about his situation.He was pretty sure Stacey wasnt having the same doubts he was having.He was happy for her, but he couldnt help but believe a gulf had just emerged between them in the aftermath of the test.She was the best and he was the worst.He had to duck through a doorway when Davis led him into an office.Delacourt was sitting behind a desk.The man looked up and his face first showed puzzlement and finally anger.Whats the meaning of this?These things are not pets, Davis.I know that, sir.This one is malfunctioning.I need authorization to link up to Henshaw for a diagnostics test.Delacourt cocked his head to the side.Are you sure its that serious?Why not just recondition it and start over?Weve never had a unit fail the weapons test, sir.You cant recondition for that.This thing is busted beyond my understanding.Henshaw wont be happy.Hes as busy as ever, so dont expect him to jump right into it.Davis nodded.If we need to shut it down until he has time, thats okay.This thing hasnt shown any promise anyway.He tapped the back of his hand against Jacks torso.Jack hated to be referred to as a thing or an it, but it hardly made him feel any lower than he already felt.Delacourt said, Permission granted.But if Henshaw cant get to it immediately, dont shut it down.Find it some menial labor up top.Jack sure hoped Henshaw had the Midas touch and could help him reunite with the other recruits.But the way things had gone for him, he just knew his luck wasnt about to get any better.Davis knocked on his chest plate like he was an oak door and said, Follow me.Jack walked after him.He sort of hoped Delacourt would say goodbye, or at least ask to know his name, but he simply went back to perusing his paperwork.Jack looked down at his bare metal chest and realized why Delacourt didnt give a shit about him.He didnt even warrant a number down here, let alone a name and a back story.He ducked through a few more doorways until they arrived at a large, well lit room with gizmos and devices and display screens that made no sense to him.But it was obvious that it was some type of lab or R&D department or something.A room to tinker with robots.Davis pointed to a circular port nestled into the far wall.Plug yourself in over there.He did as instructed.Davis hit a few buttons on one of the consoles and Henshaws face appeared on one of the screens.The doctor looked perplexed.What has happened?The concern was evident in his constricted voice.Weve had a malfunction with this unit.Davis gestured Jacks way.Henshaw stared at him hard, like he couldnt believe for a second that one of his precious units had had the audacity to fail.Jack thought about nodding or waving, but he just hung his head in embarrassment instead.Henshaw guffawed.Impossible!The last batch I sent was pristine.What did you oafs do to it?Nothing.It wouldnt activate during weapons testing.Weve never had a washout so early in training, so I thought Id ask if you could take a look at it.Ill take a look, but if its files are too corrupted to fix quickly, youll have to send it back up here for further diagnostics.We both know Delacourt wont let us waste the fuel for that.Lets just hope its an easy fix.Henshaw shook his head.That man is a buffoon.He ruins more units than he trains.Davis smiled, but he said, I disagree with you, but thats beside the point.I have the unit plugged in and ready.Henshaw let out a deep, disapproving breath, and started to tap his fingers on a console just out of view.Jack felt his mind flicker and then it switched off.He awoke to a pounding headache.He could overhear Davis and Henshaw talking.Henshaw said, I dont know what to tell you.All of its systems are fully operational.I saw nothing that gave me any concern.Well, then we cant allow it to move on in training.Id prefer you send it my way so I can get my hands inside of it, but youre right about Delacourt.Hell never allow it.I have another shipment of units coming your way in a few weeks.You could send that one back after they offload.Just shut it down until then.Davis sucked air between his teeth and said, Delacourt wants to put it to work if it cant be used for traditional combat.I doubt hell put too much stock in rehabilitating one single unit and allocating so many resources to it when we have so many more constantly coming our way.Henshaw sighed.These units cost a small fortune each.Just because Delacourt receives dozens of units a month doesnt diminish their value, just their perceived value in his eyes.Like I said, hes a buffoon.Well, hes the guy giving us our orders, so until you talk the ambassador into coming down into the trenches to deal with him, youre stuck doing it his way.Hey, Im just griping.Im an old man.Permit me the occasional grumbling session.Ill probably put this guy to work on the surface.He can offload freight when it arrives and help man the defensive positions.Davis paused for a second and then asked Henshaw, Have any of the rebels managed to zero in on your location yet?Dont worry about me.Even if they could detect me so far out from Epigog, theyd have to get through the motion sensing defenses Im surrounded by.I dont like their chances.Worry about yourselves.Were not too worried really.Theyve all been inept fools so far.Jack interrupted them both.What are you talking about?Who are you talking about?He had to know.If he was going to be used in defense, he wanted to know who the enemy was that hed be defending against.Davis cut him with his eyes.We supply troops and protection to the Beetars.Theyre the apex species in this quadrant of the galaxy.Because of that, they have jealous enemies who would like nothing more than to see them fall from grace.Henshaw added, Every now and then a species will discover where we train the troops that will eventually go on to suppress them or keep them civilized.Youd be surprised by how many life forms in the galaxy do not want to be civilized by any means.Theyll then launch a few raids on Epigog until they realize theres no way theyll get through our defenses.After that, we never see them again.Then another race figures out where we are and the cycle repeats itself.Its futile, but its a part of the deal here.Davis said to Jack, Thats enough questions.Youre lucky we even found a purpose for your sorry ass.You might not be able to draw your own weapon, but you can still mount a turret.Davis stared at him for too long and Jack realized he was waiting for confirmation from him.He said, Of course.Good.Then that is your assignment.You wont be going off world.You wont protect dignitaries or stifle rebellions or guard penal colonies.Youll protect us for the duration of your term.Youre lucky thats even an option.Otherwise youd be worthless to the program.This was even worse than reconditioning.They were giving up on him and forcing menial labor down his throat because he was good for nothing else.And now it seemed they were trying to convince him to thank them for the privilege.He knew then that hed never see Stacey again.Hed never visit strange planets and work as an enforcer for the Beetars.They might even reconsider giving him his body back.They could deem his reduced service to them unworthy of rewards.Jack wasnt even allowed to say goodbye to his fellow cadets.Davis led him back towards the lift.He waited for him to enter and then he pressed the button that ushered the lift upwards towards the surface.Jack was more frightened about this than he was about the training.He was all alone in this, whereas hed had a support group for training.He asked, Cant I practice or something?I just know I can deploy my weapons if you give me more time.Davis looked at him like he was an idiot.Your weapons deploy during a threat.Theres no greater threat than a bunch of battle mechs bearing down on you with weapons firing all around.If that didnt activate your weapons, nothing will.
