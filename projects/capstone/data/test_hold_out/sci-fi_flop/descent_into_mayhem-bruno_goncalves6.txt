I feel theres something you should know: yours is the oldest unit of the lot.Make no mistake, its systems are sound and its APU is almost new, but the chassis and appendages tolerances are no longer very high.You may want to be careful regarding any precision movements.You mean like aiming a cannon?Toni asked as unreality began to creep over him again.That doesnt worry me, Miura.Im told youll suffer greater chances of coming under fire from friendly forces than from the enemy, so precision wont help you at all there.No shit ...he moaned, remembering Rakaia.He felt his hold on his nerves begin to loosen.Listen to me, cause we havent much time, she insisted.Because of this, interface errors will tend to build up and Unit Seven will be more challenging to control.I didnt want to field it, but the higher ups insisted on deploying the entire platoon without exception.I allocated Unit Seven to you because you have among the highest scores in mobility proficiency.Wow, thats just great, maam, isnt it?Toni exclaimed with a pained smile.He fought back tears of frustration, taking out the turnkey he had been given moments ago to open the Suits hatch.Ians mobility proficiency scores were higher than his, but no doubt the unit allocated to him purred like a kitten.He knew why the special one would not draw a defective Suit, and it enraged him beyond anything words could describe.Ruka descended the scaffold without another word, leaving Toni alone to consider the smell wafting out from the open hatch.There were two simple words to describe that smell.Sweat and piss.Ruka had apparently neglected to inform him that the units previous occupant had somehow relieved himself inside the HINT.LOGIS Prime here.All units inform current status.Toni heard the call coming from the helmet still suspended before him as he was strapping into his interface.The stench was having a strange effect on him, making him want to pee despite having gone only a few minutes ago.He pushed the thought out of his mind and forced his head into the helmet, the suspension coils instantly relaxing their tension in response.The screen was pitch black, with only a password prompt in green lettering floating before his eyes.Mushima, he declared.The prompt disappeared and the screen turned a pale blue.This is your first live session, standby for user customization, a strong masculine voice suddenly spoke into his ears.The voice did not surprise him; it belonged to Unit Sevens CPU, and he would have to parley with it over the following few minutes.By now his remaining comrades were well into their status reports, and he realized he was falling behind.Without delay, the voice continued.Ocular Motion Capture targeting in three ...two ...one ...mark!A glowing red dot, barely the size of a mosquito, suddenly appeared one palm away from Tonis nose.He focused his eyes carefully on the object.Mark, he declared, at which point the dot disappeared, only to reappear a foot away and slightly to his left, challenging him to look again.Mark!Toni kept up the exercise for about as long as the CPU needed to calibrate the ocular cursor, which turned out to be a little over a minute.Without a calibrated cursor, most of his orders wouldnt get through to the units main processor, so he focused on the task completely.Calibration complete.How should I sound?it inquired.Female.Young.Soft.Is my voice now acceptable?a pleasant female voice spoke.Yes, he replied.That voice, so often chosen in their simulations, was not too different from Sarah, his youngest sister and his favorite.What is my name?she asked.Sarah, he informed her.My name is Sarah, She confirmed, as if that had always been her name.The blue screen disappeared and Toni finally gained stereoscopic vision, only just glimpsing the stall gantry as it automatically slid out of his way.To the extreme left and right of his field of vision were several virtual targets arrayed in a line.He decided to leave them alone for the moment.Unit Seven, you done debating with your OS, or do we need to leave you behind?Dunns irritated voice sounded over the comm, making him realize that they had all been waiting for him.Which would not have been the case if his predecessors hadnt torn out so many cavity wall straps, forcing him to use his imagination to tie down his gear.You do realize youre never going to shed the Tardy handle that way, dont you?he heard Hirum voice over the comm.It put a smile on his face, but the Lieutenant quickly preempted any retort.Thats the last time I hear you wasting air time, Unit Fourteen.From now on I want radio discipline.If what you have to say isnt important to the mission, dont say it.Brother One, continue, the Lieutenant finished.Let me hear it, Unit Seven, Dunn rasped.Systems up and operational, Brother One, Toni replied.LOGIS Prime, this is Brother One.All units ready.Very well.Brothers One, Two and Three, form your sections up at the mustering ground.Brother One to Section One, muster up and be quick about it, Toni heard over the comm.As Toni eyed a red virtual target it began to glow, and he prepared to activate locomotion.Engage, he declared, feeling his HINT suddenly envelope him more snugly, each of the sensation pegs hidden in the interface giving his skin a good poke before settling down again.He took a step forward, disliking the vibrating shudder that shook the unit as his right footpad hit the ground.Belatedly he realized that if he kept it up hed eventually shake the Suit into a junkpile.He began to cat walk, laying each footpad on the ground with care as he turned towards the mustering ground; the shaking ceased at once and Toni began to hear the stomping of the other titans as they left their stalls.Grimms Unit Four strode into view.The Moca Suits appeared somewhat less impressive than when last he had seen them.Almost their entire surface area had been outfitted with light, flexible armor.It appeared quite reptilian in nature, grey brown in hue and scaly, with occasional loose folds at the joints that became apparent only in movement, like the elephant skin he had seen in documentaries.The protection afforded by such armor was hardly worth the ugly, elephantine look the Moca currently possessed; it was expected to stop Infantry rounds, artillery shell fragments and direct hits from some grenade types, although any direct hit from a twenty five or thirty millimeter round, or the occasional artillery or mortar shell, would put a very abrupt end to the drivers dreams of glory.It was obvious why the platform was no longer considered adequate for combat.As Units Four, Six, Seven, Ten and Fourteen formed a single column at the mustering ground, Sergeant Dunns Unit Fifteen standing at the head, Toni heard the remaining Suits leaving their stalls.LOGIS formed for the first time since its inception.ELEVEN      945 Kilometers south east of Lograin, 23H54, 13th of June, 2771      Grove one oh thirty one up ahead, fifty paces, Toni heard over the comm.Hirums voice was regaining that peculiar monotone.He must be getting tired by now, but hes already popped all his pills, Toni thought, far beyond caring.Anymore and he is going to crash.Again.And then Unit Fourteen will again be autostriding in the rear along with a sleeping Grimm and a handful of burnouts.Fifty gigantic paces ahead, advancing in single file, they came upon a grove of Diesel Trees.Essentially Baobabs with particularly bulbous bases, the trees elongated somewhat closer to their crowns, only to branch out in a particularly spectacular manner, exposing their broad leaves to the sunlight as far as ten meters from their trunks.Toni identified the likely avenue of approach and stood directly before it, putting a knee to the ground.Units Six and Ten quickly followed suit.Without delay, eight exoskeleton clad footmen clambered off each Suit, having until then been hitching a particularly bumpy ride whilst gripping the units torso webbing.With little time before the main forces arrival, they dispersed into pairs at a run, each approaching a tree on either side of the avenue.Toni watched them momentarily, and then directed his attention to their surroundings.He had given up imagining enemy formations hidden amongst the foliage; he was simply too tired for the mental effort it required.Instead he observed without searching, counting on his innate ability to spot movement and pattern, his mind too familiarized to the forest sounds to associate any ominous significance to the occasional creak or snap.The footmen continued their work.The corporal nearest Toni quickly removed equipment from his comrades travel pack and began to cut into a square scar at the base of the tree.The bark extended more than a palms breadth into the trunk and was hard enough to require vibrating cutters, but once the block was excised, the far more porous interior was exposed and began to exude a syrupy resin.The other footman then plugged the hole with a square metal peg of just the right size, inserted a thin perforated shaft into the slot at the pegs center and shoved all two meters of it into the broad tree.The last few centimeters required some delicacy as he secured the shafts base snugly against the slots outlying lip.Now came the easy part.The corporals pack was almost entirely composed of the Portable Refinery Module, a 60 kilo weight device intended to extract and refine the Resinin oil contained deep within the genetically engineered tree.Laying the PRM on the ground, the corporal connected it to the shafts base via a wire coated hose, initiating the diagnostic pump as soon as he connected his terminal to the device.The pair had been quicker than their comrades; their PRM was the first to activate, the noisy pump breaching the silence violently enough to cause some upheaval among the nesting sparrows.So much for noise discipline, Toni thought in disgust.Shortly afterwards, the remaining PRMs added their voices to the din while their operators carefully gauged the progress on their terminals.Before a minute had passed all the devices ceased to operate, with the exception of the first; it continued on for a full twenty seconds more, producing a revving sound before slowing down and then cutting off entirely.The footmen, all logistics personnel, momentarily parleyed among themselves in an encrypted frequency before passing their findings over to Section One, LOGIS.Unit Six, this is Lightfoot, over, the corporal sounded over the comm.Whats the verdict?Bowker answered with his butch tone.Toni hadnt yet worked up the nerve to discourage him from talking like that.The macho voice sounded fake and Toni suspected the more senior footmen thought so too.The site is adequate for Main Force passage; its the mother lode we were looking for, over.Toni felt a heavy load fall from his shoulders.They had finally found a grove large enough and with substantial enough oil reserves to fuel the entire expeditionary force.That alone meant they might suspend their march for the night, something the lot of them would certainly be grateful for.After all, it would probably take the entire night to fuel the multitude of Suits.Toni hailed Bowker once the information had been relayed to Wild Rose Ops.Unit Six, here Unit Seven, over.What the deal, Seven?Bowker, drop the badass tang, its me youre talking to and they cant pick us up.Uh, right Toni, what is it?Im sure you know whats gonna happen as soon as Main Force gets here, right?Alpha Sierra Charlies gonna put us last in line to refuel.Why dont we refuel now and save ourselves the grief?I dunno, Toni, thats up to the corporal   Bowker, use your head.Tell him were nearly out of gas and want to be ready for action.That isnt exactly a lie, you know ...They neednt have worried.The corporal wholeheartedly agreed, fully aware that soon there would be a traffic jam of Suits of all shapes and sizes waiting to be topped up, and seeing the opportunity to get a head start.The armored Suits topped up in pairs with over five hundred liters of bioether saturated Resil each, their APUs having been designed to run on the biofuel as a contingency.As refueling took place, the remaining footmen demarcated the loitering area, placing luminous beacons in a funnel along the groves axis of approach.Units Six and Seven were the second pair to refuel as the remainder kept up their vigil.Any idea when the sarges gonna show?Toni asked.Unit Six did not to answer for a while, perhaps in protest for Tonis rebuke.When the fucker feels like it, I guess ...Bowker answered as soon as his unit had been topped up.Sergeant Dunns leadership had thus far been somewhat unorthodox, almost every member of his section having been rotated into command status on missions, thus leaving their cat eyed commander to engage in activities unknown.The first indication those activities were for the sections betterment had arrived in Lograin Air Base, when each Suits allocated ammunition was doubled from one hundred to two hundred twenty five millimeter rounds.LOGIS had left MEWAC base with five twenty round clips of twenty five millimeter High Explosive Tracer ammunition and twenty four flare cartridges in cluster pods per Suit, which only served to underline their commanders statement that the platoon was to avoid combat whenever possible.The principal side effect had nevertheless been a somewhat rebellious attitude from the ex ASC section leaders, most notably from 2nd Sergeant Dunn himself.Upon landing in Lograin Air Base, barely a thousand kilometers from Unmilfors Projected Area of Influence, Dunn had performed a disappearing act, leaving a shocked Grimm to assume section command as they knelt along the airfields perimeter.It had been a very silent wait, mostly due to their impromptu section leader not having figured out how to communicate over the comm without tipping off their platoon commander.When Dunn returned, moving lithely in his armored Suit as no SIC trainee could seem to manage, he had directed his section to the local ammunition depot, where they received another hundred twenty five millimeter rounds, four hundred cartridges each for their spaulder mounted anti personnel sentry guns and a pair of anti armor SABERO rocket pods, each mounted on their innermost spaulder pylons.Dunns Suit padded ponderously among them as they stowed the extra ammo.Unlike what you got at the Stables, the twenty fivers youre receiving here are armor piercing incendiary rounds.From now on you will stack your clips with one HET round followed by two API rounds successively.If you need to lay down fire, you will fire in three round burst mode using the tracer for aim correction.With the three rounds being fired at eighteen hundred rpm, youll feel it as one kick against your chest plate, but by then the slugs will be well on their way ...he bellowed over his units integrated loudspeaker as they set to work, making it happen.Never forget that the tracer loses visibility at twenty four hundred meters, so consider that your practical range.He kept up the cascade of counsel even as Toni struggled with his clips; the hand gauntlet interface should have been sensitive enough for the job, but Rukas warning had proven to be well founded, leaving him no choice but to reset his units synchronicity every few seconds.His efforts were helped not in the least by the magazines themselves, which were dented enough at their lips to occasionally send a half kilo round flying.As he despairingly picked up yet another round rolling in semi circles along the ground, Dunn continued with his rant.Never conjoin more than three clips for your twenty fiver.Each of them loaded weighs more than ten kilo mass, and you wont want more than thirty kilos added to your main gun.The magazine detention peg is just not designed to take that much weight.You should consider yourselves fortunate.Only the fact that section ones been tasked for combat resupply has allowed Command to open up an exception, otherwise not even my bitching would have allowed me to up arm you.And just like that, Toni discovered that Section One had drawn LOGISs Great Prize.Some of the news hed gotten over the grape vine as the great circus departed Lograin had been even more sinister.There were apparently those who believed that Dunn had negotiated for Sec One to be up armed in exchange of tasking to resupply detail.Toni wasnt sure he believed it, nor whether, if it was true, he loved Dunn or hated him for it.Unit Six, here Brother One, over.Speak of the devil ...Er ...here Unit Six, inform, over.Bowker never tried to talk tough with Dunn.My unit is one mike from your location, coming in from your north west with Main Force in tow.Upon Main Force arrival, Section One will be relieved by Alpha Sierra Charlies 1st platoon, 2nd section, and proceed to waiting area.LOGIS Prime wants a word with us.*****      All LOGIS members were free of their armored Suits for the first time since leaving Lograin, their units currently fulfilling the role of full metal gargoyles around the platoons improvised mustering ground.From all around Toni and his comrades, a multitude of hard, flat titanium faces and ice cold oculars stared down, contemplating the tiny creatures that controlled their fates.The platoon didnt form up, but huddled instead around Lieutenant Templeton, who for the first time in an age was simply the Ell Tee instead of LOGIS Prime.His subordinates looked quite different from when last hed laid eyes on them.There were already some dedicated autostriders among the cadets, Templeton thought distastefully.Sueli Cassel was bright and dedicated, and yet she had been the first to fold, vomiting so much only a few hours into the land excursion that the inside of her Suits interface cavity sloshed with every stride, much of the muck having been absorbed by her travel pack before finally sludging up and settling over the entire cavity floor.Motion sickness had always been an issue with the Suits.About as soon as the first walkers had begun to pad over the Thaumantian continent, their drivers had had to contend with it, the end result being that no rookie driver was able to operate his Suit for extended periods without medication.His platoon members were therefore regularly allotted several adhesive patches apiece, meant to be attached to the skin behind their ear before each session.The first Driving Patches had been exclusive scopolamine vectors, until it was realized that the high atmospheric pressure on Capicua caused the anti motion sickness medication to induce extreme dilation of the pupils.Several sergeants lost their eyes to glaucoma before the patches were reinforced with mirtazapine and clonidine, counteracting the blindness causing pupil dilatation and ocular hypertension.The patches were presently quite sophisticated, although some drivers had proven to be unable to deal with the multitude of side effects from the combined medication.Sueli had been relegated to the autostrider brigade at Main Forces rearguard, where she remained sick despite alternative treatments.It was not always so simple, however.Allerton had also been persistently sick, but an encrypted conversation with the driver had confirmed the commanders suspicion; Motion sickness was sometimes a mask for cowardice, and the lieutenant had heard enough to think about eventually directing the Allerton boy away from front line duty.Sueli, on the other hand, had proven to be a much tougher nut to crack, and she had hidden behind the motion sickness explanation as if it were a Spartan shield.She hadnt as yet spent more than a day away from the rear.Hirum was the one most fraying on his nerves.Motion sickness wasnt the problem there at all, the drivers inner ear and stomach apparently being tough enough for the jerky accelerations inherent to Suit locomotion.But on the sixth day he had begun to suffer a persistent increase in his stress levels, accompanied by an abrupt decrease in performance.From that day onwards, Hirum had been experiencing what Templeton could only describe as a series of miniature nervous breakdowns, followed by suspiciously quick recoveries.Maybe the driver was trying to break the tempo of operations to suit his limitations.Maybe it was something else entirely.Autostriders aside, it was clear from their expressions that exhaustion was taking a hold of most of the remainder, and it had begun to court the hardier drivers as well.He felt relieved at having requested the timeout.It appears youve lost more than five kilos apiece since I last saw you together ...he stated.It was no joke; they had probably lost that if not more.He began to chuckle.I wont lie, you all look like youve gone through the gut of a Master Sergeant.A few grinned.There were even a few laughs, but Hirums expression remained as empty as before.The cadets lack of emotional response was known as blunted affect, and it never meant anything good about the subjects emotional health.Thats why I wanted to record this moment of misery on photo.Tomorrow, whatever happens, you will survive.And when you do, I want you all to take a good look at your tragic mugs and laugh at what you see there.Sergeant, if you please ...Before long, what the lieutenant most desired began to happen.It was like magic, that strange phenomenon called morale.As they began to jockey for position with a pair of kneeling Mocas as backdrop, directed only sparingly by their section commanders (as hed ordered them to), some cross talk began to take place among them.Then someone made a joke (Rosa) and there was an outburst of laughter.From that moment onwards it didnt matter that their lips cracked and bled with the effort; quick grins covered their faces almost entirely, expressions softened and the motley crew reverted to their natural selves in no time at all.He observed them carefully.Rosa stood beside Miura at the back, plugging his nose theatrically and complaining at the stench of urine that apparently emanated from his fellow driver.He was quite the entertainer.On Miuras other side, Tani also seemed to be keeping her distance, although perhaps for some other reason, he supposed.Besides Tani, the troops left flank was almost entirely composed of Miura affiliates, as hed begun to think of them as.Winters, Hirum, Rosa, and the remainder of section one, sans Kimble, seemed to have clumped together into a group, the Boy with Strange Golden Eyes at its center.Miura hadnt as yet rotated into interim command of a mission, but Templeton had noticed over the comms how many had deferred to him when in doubt, even the Kimble character, although Miura often seemed as much at a loss as the rest.Perhaps there was more to him than appeared at first sight, he thought.Then again, perhaps not.Ian didnt think twice and pitched a tent in the center, and no one appeared to object to that at all.That didnt even qualify as ambition by afterthought; Templeton knew Ian was only thinking about how the Old Man would react if he saw his grandson in any position other than front and center.No one clumped around him.The blonde cadet kept his face tightly disciplined as his platoon mates positioned themselves to his flanks and rear, as if he were being surrounded by the enemy but was too polite to frown about it.Tactical monster, Templeton considered.He cursed his older brother yet again for what he had done to his own son.The boy was probably damaged beyond repair, although the lieutenant was slightly impressed by the fact that no one had yet perished at his hands.Templeton took a few stills and recordings, participating good naturedly in the banter before handing the cam to a friendly footman.The platoon posed and then posed again, and the level of noise soon began to attract unwanted attention from nearby ASC drivers.The lieutenant hushed the troop at once and sent the majority to the waiting line to top up their Suits.Discreetly he called Miura aside.We need to talk a moment, Miura.Got the time?Nothing but time, sir.Have I done something wrong?The lieutenant chuckled.Why is it every time I call a cadet aside, he think hes about to get squeezed?No, as far as I know you havent done anything wrong.Tell me how things have been going for you.That seemed to give the driver some pause for thought.Well, he finally said, weve been on the move non stop for twenty days, never knowing the enemys location.I and my mates are in the same platoon, but today is the first time Ive seen their faces since Lograin, they look as bad as I feel, and some of them look worse.Im not even sure what day of the week it is, or where I currently find myself besides some position on some map, and no one else knows any better.I stink all over, I itch all over, I havent washed since MEWAC and I feel like I have sticky paste covering my body and gun oil in my hair.Other than that Im OK.The lieutenant inclined his head in consideration and let the sarcasm slide.The Mocas operating system is a bit simple, he conceded.Thats to be expected, seeing as it was meant to be supported by an equally simple CPU.Has something to do with the price tag, I guess.But the map is there and it is accurate.Trust me on that.As for where the enemy is, is it really that important to you?Miura nodded silently.Very well.Were currently forty clicks closer to Unmil than any UAVs have come before and less than four hours march from the mine plantation.We have some reports there was a disturbance around these parts a few months ago, heavy enough to cause a brand new dawn wave to propagate over the continent.The Research Hubs compiled all the data pertaining to the event and processed it.The point is they figured the dawns point of origin to be about three hundred clicks to our east, give or take a hundred.My guess is, if the enemys around these parts, hes going to notice our presence here.Which is why from now on Main Force will be moving in battle line instead of column.That is also why LOGIS will be marching half a click behind the ASC.Todays grove was a good catch, it was what we were needing.From now on therell be no grove hunting, well be operating on what we have.Feel any better?Actually, yes sir.I was beginning to feel like this could go on forever.The lieutenant grinned.Rest assured that if our commander had decided to not jaunt to Lograin, it would have.But thats not the reason why I wanted to talk to you.Who are you paired up with?Grimm.Unit Four, sir.Not anymore.Youll pair up with Fourteen while Four assists Brother One.Understood?Miuras disappointment was hard to miss.I ...Yes sir.Why?The lieutenant sighed heavily.Listen, Miura.Im sure youve already noticed that Hirums having it hard out here.Hes going to need someone he knows and respects beside him to keep him in line.You realize that, dont you?Yes sir.Its just that ...well, I  Miura began.You just want to be a hero.Right, I get that, except that youre not authorized to be a hero.Thats the true nature of military service.Shitty assignments.I hate them as much as you and I do everything I can to stay away from them.But theyre still assignments and they need to be done, otherwise I foresee Hirum will screw up so bad hell either get himself killed, get everyone else killed, get himself court martialed, or a combination of the above.Youre his mate, right?Yes ...Ill arrange to open a private channel so you can talk only between the two.That should make it easier for you.But youve got to keep him engaged.Are we clear?Yes sir, Ill get it done, his subordinate finally said, apparently resigned to his fate.Excellent.Now get a meal in your belly.And wash.You smell like youve spent the last three weeks living in a latrine.*****      Toni gave Unit Seven a cold, hard look.It stared back at him as placidly as ever, its expression a study in neutrality.Toni remembered how at first he had thought it looked somewhat wrathful in appearance.Now it appeared almost afraid, although perhaps he was simply seeing his own emotions reflected there.The Suit was currently lightly armored, and it was certainly armed about as well as he could have hoped for, but the array of weaponry still looked woefully inadequate when he considered what hed seen over the net.Leiben had been solidly creamed from afar and drones had fallen like confetti from the sky.Yet they were expected to get up close and personal with the attackers, a military force whose exact location, strength and number of bodily appendages was entirely unknown.Just how exactly were they supposed to engineer a victory?He took out a thick marker hed commandeered in Lograin and hopped up onto the units right knee.Approaching its forearm, he began to write on it, trying hard to make the lettering square and legible.Finally found a name for it?he heard from below as he finished up.It was Ray.Not quite ...Im calling mine MAY REVENGE.What do you think?Sounds appropriate, I guess ...Toni hadnt even considered naming his Suit.Somehow he didnt feel connected to it enough to do so.He had always thought it would be a Hammerhead hed eventually be naming, anyway.Ray scrutinized the print and read it aloud.I am not authorized to be a hero.Whats that about?he asked in puzzlement.Its just something the ell tee told me.Its to remind me of what I have to do.And whats that?Im a baby sitter, I guess ...Toni admitted with a sigh, and he explained what had happened only an hour before.Jeeesh ...Hirum?Ray exclaimed once hed finished.Yup.Thats bad luck for you, Tones.Escort detail on your own mate.But you still drew resupply, so dont bitch about it too much.Im gonna be in the rear end digging emplacements and stretching wires while youre having a ball, so its not all bad.Maybe youll even get lucky and see some action ...Yeah.Lucky ...Toni mused.You all right?Yes.Listen, howre things going in sec three?Your sarge putting up for you?Jorren?Every time he sees us, he gets this look like hes disgusted or something and looks away.Its beginning to piss me off.I might just have words with him about that ...Toni grinned.Had he known Ray for only a day, he might have taken him seriously, but he had since learned that if his mate had that deadpan face, it was probably because he was screwing around.No cadet would dare have words with their section commanders; that was a conversation that would never happen.They all knew the ex ASC drivers were ticked off for having been pulled from their company in the eve of Capicuas first battle.Yeah, you do that.Theyre full of themselves, they are.Need to be put in their places.And what of the special one?Hell, forget about him, Tones, hes not screwing around.Suelis the one pissing me off.Sickness is her natural state now, though every once in a while she goes into remission.Right now Hannah, Ian and I are sec threes only operational units, except for the sarge, of course.And were all thats needed, you know.That Hannahs a real trooper.Shes the best looking femme too, now that Suelis gone three shades of green.I   Ray cut off whatever he had been about to say.As Hannah approached she tripped over a shrub, letting off a girlish squeal quickly followed by an embarrassed smile.Toni realized what Ray had meant; having lost only a kilo or two, she didnt have the almost emaciated look of Rakaia and especially Sueli, and as such her complexion wasnt much the worse for wear.Her eyes, pale as always and a little tired, nevertheless expressed some enjoyment at her predicament.And she seemed as yet completely untouched by fear.Hi, Toni.Can we talk?she asked.Tonis brow twitched at the question.Arright, Im gonna get some sleep.See ya later, Tones.You too, Khaki ...Ray declared with a twisted smile on his face, giving Hannah a brotherly clap on the shoulder she seemed not to notice.They waited silently until he was out of earshot.Khaki?Toni remarked with a smile.Arakaki.Khaki.Its his way, she explained distractedly, refusing to meet Tonis eyes for a moment.Ahuh.He likes you.Shut up, ok?Im here about Rakaia.Oh.Are you angry with her?she asked bluntly.Now that he thought about it, he had never had a one to one conversation with Hannah before.No, far from it.I think it was me who screwed up, actually, though I dont want to get into details ...he answered carefully.Good, I dont wanna hear about it, she said evenly before pushing on.Point is, Rakaias got some issues to deal with so she can be a little ...uh, brittle, sometimes.I know that and she knows it too.And Ill admit whatever happened in med bay is none of my business.So I guess Ill just be direct.Do you like her?No.I mean I like her, but not that way.I mean, hell, shes as well equipped as any Ive seen so maybe I was checking her out a bit, but ...can I shut up now?he finished, hating himself to the core.Hannahs slender eyebrows had perked up just a little at his reference to equipment, but she hadnt said anything.She considered his reply for a while.OK, its simple then.Youve apologized, from what I heard.She accepts your apology but says for you to keep your distance, you fucking pervert.Not my words, she added with a smile.Im sorry ...was all Toni could say.Keep your head down out there, OK?she warned, flashing him with a bright smile before she walked away.Not to worry, dear Hannah, he thought as defeat overtook him, Ill never raise it again.Turning away, he slipped the Suits access key into its slot.TWELVE      945 kilometers south east of Lograin, 03H43, 14th of June, 2771      Enveloped in darkness, Toni awoke to a persistent beeping sound.Groggy with sleep, he decided to ignore the sound in the hope that it would eventually go away.Instead it was replaced by a compelling whoop suspiciously similar to the alert one would hear inside an armored Suit.Then he remembered.Opening his eyes to find yet more darkness, he ordered his unit to activate.Eyelids still sticky with sleep, Toni finally gained audio and visual, and he blinked furiously at the written warning on his virtual foreground.ALARM MODE ACTIVATED.SIGNAL SOURCE ASC P1 S4  Feeling a chill reach into his bones, Toni inquired over the comm.Brother One, here Unit Seven, over.There was no delay in the answer.Shut your ass, Seven, Ill get to you in a mike.A particularly loud report suddenly made itself heard, jolting him fully awake more quickly than anything else could have.Moving his helm around, he tried to lay eyeballs on the source of the explosion, finding only that the remainder of his platoon, still facing inwards into their circle, were trying to do the exact same thing.Here LOGIS Prime.All units about face and hunker down where you are.It was the lieutenant, and he sounded angry.Toni hurried to comply, whirling fast around his center of gravity and putting his kneepad to the ground a full half second before the rest.He gripped his rifle firmly and strained his ears, trying to pick up every sound.All remained silent, except for the occasional nervous chirp of birds woken by the report.He wondered if perhaps they were hearing something he could not.He increased audio sensitivity, gradually becoming aware of far off popping sounds, followed by a second long roar.Somewhere far off, a unit of the ASC was firing thirty millimeter cannon.Toni tried to keep his breathing slow and steady as the seconds passed by, his effort sabotaged by a particularly loud concussion from the south east.The unit to Tonis left flinched at the sound, the Suit producing a shudder in the act.It was Hirum, and he had probably augmented his audio sensitivity too.Toni dragged his ocular mouse to the communications panel on his virtual display and looked at his options there, finding that the lieutenant had kept his word.He activated a private comm link between Units Seven and Fourteen.Yo, Fourteen, you believe this?Toni?a disbelieving voice sounded over the comm.Yours truly.No worries mate, Grimms with the sec leader now.Youre with me from now on.Really?there was an almost childish note in Hirums voice.You OK with that?Hell yeah, Toni, course I am.Are we on an encrypted channel?Yeah.I, uh, took a look at the communications panel and realized your unit is on it.Maybe the pairs can parley privately now.Oh, thats great.Thats more than great, cause Im freaking out here ...Listen, Fourteen.Dont do that, OK?All we need to do is what were told.Itll all work out, alright?A monotonous voice cut off their conversation.LOGIS, here LOGIS Prime, standby to receive operational updates from Wild Rose.This is the only time Ill be saying this.From now on these messages will be keeping you posted on current events.There was general silence for a few moments.Uh, Fourteen, maybe wed better keep the comms to the minimum, before we miss something like that ...Roger that.A few moments later the Op update appeared before Tonis eyes.ASC 1ST PLATOON, 4TH SECTION, ON PERIMETER PATROL 5 KM EAST SOUTH EAST OF MAIN FORCE ENCOUNTERED UNKNOWN NUMBER OF LAND VEHICLES.FOUR SUCH VEHICLES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, REMAINDER HAVE RETREATED DUE EAST.MAIN FORCE WILL ASSEMBLE PREDETERMINED BATTLE LINE WITH VANGUARD 500 METERS DUE EAST FOR IMINENT CONTACT PROGRESSION.He read the message twice over before banishing it to his mission log.Then it finally began to sink in that an ASC section had contacted and wasted four enemy vehicles, and the blood in his veins began to flow faster and hotter.The silence over the comm was broken once again.LOGIS, here LOGIS Prime.Form up at the tree line facing east.Sec One in the center, Secs Two and Three on left and right flank respectively, over.All units immediately obeyed, their drivers somewhat less hesitant than they had been previously.Tonis augmented hearing began to pick up a multitude of APUs coming to life all around the forest.The entire ASC was prepping for locomotion, their turbines working furiously to increase the gas pressure in their pressure vessels, their drivers anxious to join the comrades who had just blooded themselves.The Mocas moved towards their starting points, their motions those of an undersea diver walking on the seabed.The Hammerheads, however, were fast and fluid as they occupied their positions, the members of LOGIS reaching their line about twenty seconds afterwards.That was one of the very few things Toni knew about the Hammerhead; its closed system forewent air in favor of germane, mostly because the gas was far more fluid than ordinary air, thus making PAM inflation and deflation much quicker, thus improving pseudo muscular performance, and thus increasing Suit agility and reflexes.He put the thought out of his mind since it depressed him, thinking instead on the opposite side of that particular coin.If the Hammerheads exterior pressure vessel were to be breached, it would only be a matter of time before complete locomotive failure took place, since the system wasnt designed to work with ordinary air.The wait persisted and Toni was once again forced to consider Dunns advice at the shuttle platform.Trying to relax, he found himself unable to do so, and began to compulsively check his operational status instead.Discreetly he confirmed that his main weapon was safed and checked its serviceability.The sleek rifles slender, fluted barrel was mostly hidden inside its ample hand guard.The hand guard also concealed an automatic anti personnel shotgun, the fifteen millimeter cartridges it used having been designed to release twenty four flechettes upon firing.The shotguns two hundred round helical magazine was presently empty, that particular caliber no longer in production.As ordered by Main Force Ops, his sentry guns were at the moment deactivated, their employment dependant on his voicing a key word while eyeing the appropriate icon on his display.Knowing his own tendency for forgetfulness, Toni recorded the key word on a semi transparent sticky note and dragged it below the icon.When activated, those guns would fire upon any nearby hostile forces and even upon incoming projectiles with twenty millimeter fragmentation grenades, supposedly creating a safe zone around his unit.The only problem was that sometimes the Mocas CPU got a little confused about exactly who the enemy was, hence the Main Force order.The SABERO rocket pods were preset in the same fashion, but he set them instead to launch by rifle trigger for faster engagement.There were two rockets per pod, allowing him to engage only four targets at best.He had been surprised to discover, however, that both pods together were worth about as much as his Suits production cost, quite the thing to boost his confidence in their effectiveness.LOGIS, here LOGIS Prime, increase unit spacing to forty paces and standby for lomo, the lieutenant sounded over the comm.Toni didnt budge an inch.Belatedly he realized he was at the square center of the progression line.The more rational part of his mind remembered that enemy contact could take place along any part of its extension, but still he would have much preferred to be in the flanks.Everything he had ever learned regarding conventional combat tactics made clear that it was the center that usually took the most punishment, their traditional role being to fix the enemy while the flanks became mobile to do the greater part of the actual killing.He consoled himself with the fact that there was an armored company half a kilometer ahead shielding their movement.He had barely begun to calm down when the the electrifying order finally came through.Attention to all LOGIS units.Locomotion.I repeat, locomotion.Tonis footpads began to move without being having told to, his ears catching the sound of gigantic footfalls as nineteen armored Suits crossed the tree line into the forest beyond.*****      All units pause and observe ...Toni heard over the comm.He halted his progression again, the remainder of LOGIS doing the same.Toni suspected the ASC units ahead were also pausing to listen, and to release micro UAVs into their surroundings for a quick look see.He had already lost count of the number of times the order had been given, although by now the procedure was gaining a familiar feel, like pausing beside the living room door to judge whether his father was inside before crossing its threshold.Every once in a while hed receive an update on his display or a verbal order from Dunn; he no longer had access to Lieutenant Templetons communications.The only other sources of input he still possessed were his own sensors and the annoying comrade who was presently whispering into his ear.Do you think they saw something?Toni?Hirum breathed fearfully over the comm, causing Tonis tense jaw to tighten a little more.Lay off the comm, Fourteen ...he replied, trying hard to keep the irritation from his voice.Hirum had been getting on his nerves since the imminent contact progression had begun more than an hour ago, his comrade having taken to speculating on everything that might be happening up ahead.At first the noise over the comm had been merely annoying, but Hirums constant thought verbalization was beginning to cross the boundary from annoying into deadly distraction.As he willed his jaw to unclench again, Toni noticed diffuse smoke at a spot forty paces ahead.He switched his spectrum sensitivity to infrared and picking up a small, flickering heat source in the distance, partially obscured by the plantation trees.He kept his eyes on the light and wondered at what it was.Hey.Hey!Theres something out there, man!Hirum suddenly cried, causing Tonis body to tense up instinctively.He scanned his surroundings, seeing nothing outside or on his display worthy of attention.Gritting his teeth, he willed himself to calm down again, reminding himself that it was Hirum whod given the alarm.You talking about the smoke up ahead or what?Toni asked, keeping communications strictly to their private line.Huh?Yeah, thats it  Wait, you think its where they wasted the Unmils?Uh.Yeah, thats probably it.I guess weve advanced five clicks, so thatll put us right where the shit happened.Listen mate, check your panic over the comm, alright?I nearly went into labor here ...He mentally kicked himself for not having thought of it first.Of course that was where the smoke was coming from.He searched the ground ahead and noticed how badly it had been disturbed by the maneuvering Hammerheads, and how a tree seemed to have been violently shouldered into; its trunk was bent at an angle, a splintered limb resting on the ground beside it.You think somethings gonna happen soon, Toni?You do realize its the third time youve asked me that, dont you?!Toni finally burst out.There was merciful silence for a moment before an apologetic Hirum answered.Sorry, mate ...Its just that  how long do we have to keep on doing this?We cant keep up the pace.This doesnt make any sense ...Well keep going like this for as long as we want to do the job and get home safe ...or maybe youd prefer for us to walk into an am  Here LOGIS Prime, from now on there will be no chatter over the comms.All orders will be given and received over your displays.As the lieutenant cut off, Toni quickly checked his communications panel to find that his ability to verbalize over the comm had been deactivated.A sudden thought stabbed at him, one that suggested that the lieutenant had been monitoring their conversation.A moment later he received a flash memo from the lieutenant.SORRY ABOUT THAT, ANY MORE FRICTION AND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO FRAG THE KID.NOT CONVENIENT.The memo confirmed his suspicion.He tried to send one in return but found he was blocked from doing so, resigning himself instead to trying to remember whether hed said anything potentially compromising over the last hour.Eventually deciding he was safe from court martial, he basked instead in the joy of having been unplugged from his partner, although at the expense of not being able to communicate with Dunn without activating the emergency mode.He barely had time to think about what would justify Em mode activation before another memo appeared on his display.RAISE CAT PRESSURE TO FULL AND PREP FOR LOCOMOTION.Toni activated his APU, feeling his body shake in its HINT as the turbine resting below his Interface Cavity roared noisily into life.That was the other reason why they were halting their advance every few minutes.Progressing with activated APUs was a little like hiding in a forest with a solar flare siren strapped to ones back.It was worse for the Hammerheads than for the Mocas; the combat units had more efficient PAMs and greater interior tank capacity, but their armor and chassis was on the bulky side, and the gas it took to make them move forced the drivers to top up more frequently.Putting it simply, his Moca could move on air pressure alone for a full ten minutes at maximum consumption, while a Hammerhead could hardly manage more than six.The combat units upside was an attractive one though: they carried more than five times the armor and three times the operational payload of the Moca.The APU ceased to operate after only a couple of minutes, leaving him to wait patiently while their big brothers half a kilometer ahead continued to pressurize.He soon received another memo ordering renewed progression.Toni was fortunate; his trajectory took him towards the source of the smoke.What he saw there, however, disappointed him greatly.What was left of an open box mining vehicle, not so different from something hed expect to see on a farm, smoldered inside a deep crater, its front so heavily damaged any possible seat would have been crushed beyond recognition.It still carried part of its load of plantation seeds, the remainder of its cargo having been wastefully strewn over the ground.Pushing on, he came upon a second object thirty meters down, apparently the remains of a robotic arm, gouges on the ground nearby suggesting that it had been flung there from the wreck.Moments later he came upon another mining vehicle even more badly damaged than the first, its chassis having been mercilessly riddled by cannon fire.There wasnt the slightest suggestion of armament on or around the wrecks.Had they even belonged to the Unmils, or had the ASC patrol simply obliterated the first vehicles they came upon that didnt wave a white flag on it?He heard a metallic sound behind him, turning quickly to find the lieutenants Suit holding the robotic arm in its gauntlet, inspecting it carefully.A text appeared on his display.HAVE YOU COME ACROSS ANY CORPSES OR BODY PARTS?It was from the lieutenant.NEGATIVE.ANY WEAPONS?NEGATIVE.KEEP YOU EYES PEELED.COOLED DOWN YET?SORRY SIR.I LET HIM GET TO ME.NO SHIT.I COULD HEAR YOUR TEETH GRINDING OVER THE COMMS.KEEP YOUR COOL AND CARRY ON.They pressed onwards, their progress occasionally punctuated by pauses for pressurization and observation.Tonis eventually found himself moving through flat plantation land, finding only green, unripe seeds still hanging from their trees.Every couple of kilometers they came upon uncultivated islands of forest where floral species unknown to him abounded, dark and dense and sinister, and packed with troops of tail less macaques, their red rumps contrasting starkly with their storm grey coats.The islands exploded with avian confetti every time they set their turbines running, dismaying him as the flocks rose high enough to be visible for kilometers around.It was morning, chronologically speaking, when LOGIS finally hit hilly terrain, the islands and plantations fast asleep except for the three kilometer wide swath of alarmed fauna in Main Forces wake.Soon they would be sound asleep as the giants that had woken them disappeared into the forest.He envied them for that.Execute order: Upper Limbs Autostride.Execute order: Deactivate Right Ocular, Toni ordered his OS.His right eye plunged into darkness and he lifted the flip up display that covered it, stretching his arm out to feel his way along the interface cavitys wall for the light switch.Finding an inset switch, he turned it, remembering too late that it opened the hatch.The cavitys interior was suddenly flooded with light as the hatch popped open, paralyzing the Suits right appendage as musky air poured in from the gaping hole.Cursing to himself, Toni used the daylight to find the light switch to his left, turning it on before he tried to shut the hatch again.It failed to close.Cursing again, he turned the hatch switch repeatedly, finding to his frustration that it wouldnt budge more than an inch before returning to its open position.Too late his left eye saw a low lying branch and the Suit collided against it, the deafening clang making him bite his own tongue as he struggled for balance.Still Looking through his left eye, he realized hed fallen behind and picked up his pace, finding it much harder to maneuver without binocular vision.With his right eye he searched the interface cavitys interior, finding to his surprise and satisfaction that the collision had sealed the troublesome hatch.Hastily he removed a small pill from the pouch on his HINT and slipped it into his mouth, swallowing it dry.He regained stereoscopic vision to find a memo floating before his eyes.HOW MANY PILLS HAVE YOU TAKEN TODAY?FIRST ONE NOW, SIR.DID YOU NOTICE?EVERYONE DID.NEXT TIME KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE TREES.STILL GRINDING YOUR TEETH?NO SIR, NO TEETH GRINDING.GOOD.DONT FORGET TO KEEP AN EYE ON FOURTEEN TOO.DOESNT MATTER IF YOU HAVE TO GRIND YOUR TEETH TO DUST, ONCE WE RETURN ILL GET YOU NEW ONES.GET THE JOB DONE.YESSIR.YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE ASC LEFT FLANK HAS FOUND THE MISSING MINERS.THEYRE JUST BONES ON A FIELD NOW AND THEIR EQUIPMENTS MOSTLY ABSENT.DONT TELL HIRUM IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER.DID YOU KNOW ROSA WAS ACQUAINTED WITH SOME OF THE MINERS?NO SIR.HES NOT REACTING TOO WELL TO THE NEWS.IF NECESSARY I WILL PULL YOU FROM HIRUM AND HOOK YOU UP WITH HIM.ARE YOU GAME?MOST DEFINITELY, SIR.Toni had to wonder about the lieutenant.Was he texting the other units as well, or only his?Not that he disliked the attention, but somehow it made him feel pressured.The thought was interrupted by a flash update on his display.FORWARD UNITS REPORT AVIAN UPHEAVAL ONE CLICK EAST IN PROXIMITY OF FRIENDLY FORCES CENTER.UNMIL ACTIVITY SUSPECTED.STANDBY FOR ORDERS.And there it was, the ever more familiar ripple up his spine.It wasnt as bad as the first time hed received a similar warning over an hour ago.That time it had been the Hammerheads turbines that had startled the wildlife.But the timid animal in the corner of his mind reminded him that the Suits were currently running on pressurized gas alone.He felt a second ripple up his spine and began to gear himself up for action.HERE BROTHER ONE.FROM NOW ON AND UNTIL CONTACT WE WILL USE HAND SIGNS ONLY.ALL EYEBALLS ON MY UNIT.Toni turned to his section leader to find Unit Fifteen with its gauntlet held high above its head, its index finger on display.They hurried to comply, forming a single column behind his unit with Grimm bringing up the rear.A quick look to his flanks made Toni feel a little anxious; they were now clear of friendlies, the remaining sections well on their way to set up a possible axis of retreat in the company of combat engineers.Section Ones mission was clear.Upon imminent contact they were to rendezvous with the two resupply sections of the ASC platoons two hundred meters behind the skirmish line, and then assist in ammunition resupply of combat units on demand.In the previous hours false alarm they had gotten as far as where they were now, pausing in single column as Dunn awaited a signal from Main Force.The delay proved to be a short one.Dunn gave the signal to advance and stomped ahead at high speed, leaving the remainder of his section to try to keep up.Toni momentarily felt his footpads leave the ground, and he realized that he was actually running in his armored Suit for the first time.He deeply disliked the shuddering noises and pendulous movements his inner ears were picking up, the timid part of his spirit hoping that something wouldnt be able to take the stress and break down.Shortly after, the column slowed and took a more winding path among the trees, as if their section leader was looking for something and failing to find it.They came to a full stop beside a clump of trees with no resupply Suits yet in sight.Following their sec leaders signals, the section formed a loose line facing east and advanced carefully for about a hundred meters before pausing again and putting a knee to the ground.Toni chose a particularly broad tree to shelter behind, although he was still afforded a good look of the front line.The Hammerheads were strewn out about a hundred meters ahead, with perhaps fifty meters of spacing between each hulking unit.Some had deployed Remote Mortar Assemblies further back, the systems still under the control of the drivers via a thirty meter armored cable.The units stood immobile, the dark grey camouflage that covered their chassis working well enough to make it difficult for Toni to count their exact number.The seconds passed by as he watched, and no resupply sections deigned to make an appearance and link up.Toni saw the detonations before he felt them; wherever he had counted a Hammerhead, and in some places where he had not, brilliant flashes blinked in and out of existence as a cascade of sparks erupted from the units.Then the very air around the Suits erupted violently, enveloping the surrounding trees in unnatural ruby red flames.The shock waves from the detonations arrived first, coming across as a particularly stiff cannonade that rattled the bones in his body as well as the structure of his Suit.The combined wave front from the secondary explosions arrived a moment later, lifting Unit Seven clear off its footpads and into the air.THIRTEEN      Mining quadrant, 08H35, 14th of June, 2771      Youve been taught how to stand in your Suit, Toni reminded himself as he stared hazily at the treetops above, the sky beyond darkening fast.Something was wrong with his Suit, although he couldnt quite figure out what it was.He rolled over his left side and onto a prone position.Pushing himself with difficulty up onto his kneepads, oblivious of the roaring chaos, he finally realized that his right appendage was unable to move.Finally managing to lift himself upright, he peered to the right side of his Suits torso.His appendage, undamaged although it was, appeared as though it had been pulled halfway round to his back, and there appeared to be an object of some kind protruding from his right breastplate, exposing its interior.Slowly he realized that the hatch had popped open, the repeat event currently leaving him able to see almost directly into his chest, where the interface cavity resided.That explained the pungent air that was presently searing Tonis lungs.He tried to close the hatch with his left gauntlet; as hed expected, it didnt budge.Almost as an afterthought, he gazed at his surroundings.He easily found east due to the wall of flames that was feeding on the plantation, belching coal black plumes of smoke into the sky as if giving birth to a storm.Movement to the south suddenly caught his attention.Dunns Unit Fifteen was a hundred paces away, motioning frantically to Toni to retreat westward.The two Mocas beside him were scorched but otherwise operational, and they accompanied their sec leader as he turned west and set off at a run, several damaged Hammerheads quickly overtaking them at a sprint.The last of the Hammerheads burned fiercely with crimson flames as it bounded along, heedless of the thick smoky trail it left in its wake.The vision made no sense, and he dully decided that if it didnt make sense, it didnt really matter.You are not authorized to be a hero, he reminded himself once more.The remembered words reminded him of Hirum.Turning north, he searched for his partners unit, and found it still gripping what remained of the tree it had been sheltering behind.Toni bounded towards him, and he began to choke on the fumes that were circulating more briskly in his cavity.Dimly he wondered if it was some sort of chemical attack.Dimly he decided he didnt care.Reaching Hirums unit, he pressed the PTT on his rifle grip, trying to hail him over the comm and failing to do so.He checked his communications panel and did not like what he saw; his OS had just completed a self diagnostic test, having confidently concluded that radio comms were no longer possible due to action of enemy frequency inhibitors.He activated his loudspeaker.Hirum, he bellowed loudly, the smallest hint of feedback in his ears.Lets get the hell outta here.Ya hear me?The Suit did not budge.Toni tried to pry Unit Fourteens hatch open with his gauntlet, not managing to find any handhold to better apply his strength.My hatch cant stay shut and his just wont open, he thought, somehow finding the irony amusing.Unit Fourteens titanium face turned slowly towards him.Its placid expression seemed to fit there, as if hugging trees in a burning forest filled with monsters was the thing to do nowadays, didnt you know?Awake now?Good!Now let go of the fucking tree, mate ...Its round oculars stared at him uncomprehendingly.Cursing, Toni grabbed a hold of Unit Fourteens torso webbing and gave him a violent yank, shaking himself so badly in the process that he teetered on the verge of unconsciousness.Two more firm pulls and he was finally able to get Hirum moving at the cost of an uprooted tree.Hirum backtracked placidly under his mates towing force, hugging the tree as if it were some hideous teddy bear, clumps of earth still falling from what remained of its roots.Toni suddenly perceived movement from the smoldering forest.Instinct took over and he slipped behind Fourteens bulk.An earsplitting concussion hammered its way through his skull as Unit Fourteen tore apart, sending incandescent metal through Unit Sevens hatch and against his right arm, encased in its hydraulic interface.Lava hot spalls punctured through steel and flesh alike, the impacts shaking him as if he were being ravaged by a predator.Screaming, Unit Seven fell hard upon the earth, splintered wood raining down all over as an orange haze cloaked the unknown assailant from his sight.Jet engines screamed at full throttle beside his ears, and it took a while to realize the sound wasnt coming from outside his skull.Aside from the sharp headache, Toni felt little pain, although he was beginning to feel a warm wetness beginning to spread over his right arm and groin.Refusing to deactivate oculars, he attempted to access the integrated tourniquet under the HINTs armpit.It was no use; every time he came close, his gauntlet collided against the open hatch or his spaulder, forcing his real hand to stop short of its objective.Working against time, Toni decided to deactivate his Suit.The interior of his interface cavity was a mess.Although partially shrouded in a haze, he could still make out a few branches and an armful of leaves, fragments from Unit Fourteen and a lot of draining hydraulic fluid.He followed the fluid to its source, realizing in horror that it was mixed with blood.Desperately he pulled at the tourniquet near his armpit until the tightness satisfied him, his eyes carefully avoiding the wounds.Within fifteen minutes he would need to relieve the pressure.As if to underline the situations urgency, Toni felt the ground begin to vibrate.He reactivated Unit Seven and took a quick look around.No more than twenty meters off, an armored Suit unlike any Toni had ever seen lumbered into view.It was heavier than the Hammerhead beyond a doubt, and its aerodynamic rifle was still smoking from what looked like radiators along its barrel length.The unit managed to look squat and sleek at the same time.Its narrow skull turned to observe him.The air around the unidentified Suit suddenly became alive with supersonic fireflies, each accompanied by a sonic boom, several of them impacting the walkers superstructure in a festival of fireworks.Unaffected by the impacts, the Suit bounded back east with surprising agility and fired off a casual shot with his rifle, the sound it made no louder than a petard.The microsecond flash produced by the weapon elucidated Toni as to its nature.Toni heard the characteristic chainsaw like roar of the Hammers thirty millimeter cannon a full second after the fireflies appearance, putting them three to four hundred meters away.He searched for the enemy Suit, finding to his relief that it was nowhere to be seen.Locating his rifle beside him, Toni sat up to reach for the weapon.Something slid down onto his Suits lap with a metallic clang.He looked at the object for a while.It was torn in two just as its Suit had been, though where the other half was he wasnt inclined to speculate.Hirums corpse was still encased in its interface, hydraulic and electric wires in disarray, only his right arm remaining, his left having found someplace else to rest.His eyes were semi closed as if about to fall asleep, an illusion not helped much by the fact that most of his cranium was missing.Toni lifted the corpse delicately from his lap and laid it to rest beside Unit Fourteens exposed APU, horrified by how light the body felt to him.What remained of its head bobbed sickeningly as he laid it down, giving him a brief peek at where its brain should have been.Unformed thoughts swimming in his mind, Toni picked up his rifle and began to move east.It didnt take longer than a minute for Toni to find what he was looking for.Something between eight and a dozen Hammerheads had opted to engage the Suit, and the hilly forest was alive with ricocheting fireflies and earth shaking concussions.Every few moments a brilliant white flash could be seen from the converging point of the Hammers wrath and, some of those times, the flash struck its target, precipitating another eruption of the unnatural red fire.They were moving fast, faster than Toni could keep up with, but every time he slowed down the memory of the lolling empty head returned to him.He pressed onwards, moving across plantation land where fires raged and Hammerhead scrap was everywhere to be seen.His APU sputtered into activity, the sound it made somewhat unhealthier than when last hed heard it.Finally he put a knee to the earth inside a shallow depression and ordered his Suit to shutdown.Toni lost track of time for a while as his darker half showed up to pay the world a visit.By the time he finally snapped back into consciousness, he found himself sitting on the cavity floor, his right arm disinfected and bandaged, the tourniquet loosened, and smelling like a latrine.The arm looked ugly in its blood soaked bandages, and he realized he wouldnt be able to reinsert it into the interface.Inspecting the device as it floated before him, he began to cut into wires and hoses with his pocketknife, adding even more hydraulic fluid to the mixed puddle of blood and oil on the floor.Before much time had passed and with the assistance of a few conveniently removable pegs, Toni managed to detach the HINTs right appendage and toss it out the hatch.Renewed sounds of battle became apparent to his recovering ears, and he peered hard at his surroundings through the broken hatch.The terrain kept its secrets, whatever they were.He popped three pain killers at once, hoping they would be enough.Strapping his right arm carefully to his chest, he slipped once more into the HINT, ignoring the scent of his recent urinary contribution to the device.He activated his Suit and tried to spy the source of the sounds.Gradually he became aware of Hammerheads communicating through loudspeakers to the east.Whatever they were saying, they sounded desperate.The sound of several turbines at full throttle became clear and began to intensify.From the east, Toni finally spotted several Hammerheads sprinting in single file at speeds he had never imagined possible.The larger trees were spared by the group, the smaller ones simply being shouldered aside as they tore desperately towards the west.He counted four Suits, the rearmost lagging behind by a fair margin.It seemed to be that driver who spoke as they passed obliviously by at a hundred paces.GOING FOR IT.BEST OF LUCK!The Hammerhead released an object from its gauntlet and then put its footpad into the ground in a braking action, the extremity excavating enough earth to impress any dump truck driver.Before coming to a full stop, the Suit snapped about and fired off a short burst with its cannon.Several missiles rocketed from its spaulder pods while smoke grenades popped off around him, effectively obscuring the titan from view.
