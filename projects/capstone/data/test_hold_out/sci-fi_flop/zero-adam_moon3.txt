Id have to use a cutting torch to get those guns back from you.Im sorry, son.Its not your fault.You got a shoddy unit.That didnt make him feel any better.The lift shuddered to a halt and Davis led him outside.It was daytime on the surface.A little sand kicked up at his feet, but otherwise the weather was calm and quiet.The transport that had delivered him was gone.Before he asked the question, Davis explained, A shuttle is coming for you.It should be here in a few minutes.Youre going to be alright.Its not so bad up here.I thought I heard its dangerous for mechs on the surface.Didnt Delacourt say that the sand would deteriorate our bodies or something?It does if you dont practice proper maintenance.We cant expect new recruits to spend an hour every night to clean their joints out.But its not as big of a deal as Delacourt would have you believe.We dont train below ground because of the sand; we train down there because we come under attack from time to time.Delacourt insists we keep that info from the new recruits so we dont worry them unnecessarily.That made sense now that Jack had more information to go on.The sand didnt feel particularly corrosive to him, although he had no idea what the cumulative effects would be over time.He looked into the sky, trying to find the moon the space station orbited, but the sky was empty.He wondered how his body was doing.He wondered how much longer before it would be healed.Davis said, Look on the bright side.At least you dont have to keep training.You have no idea how hard it gets later on.A distant dark blotch appeared on the horizon, growing larger as it closed in on them.Davis said, Ah, good.Thats your ride.Good luck to you, son.With that, he turned on his heel and walked back into the lift.A moment later the sand swallowed it up greedily and Jack felt very alone.The transport gently set down a dozen feet from him.It was much smaller than the one that had dropped him off on Epigog, but it was far more maneuverable and sleek, despite the scuffed surfaces and rust spots.A robotic pilot sat in the cockpit and a lone mech hung from an opening in the side.The passenger was filthy and rusted, but that just added to its menace.It yelled at Jack, Hurry up, man.We dont have all day.Jack ambled towards the ship.He wondered what would happen if he took off running for his life, but he knew it wouldnt bode well for him.The rusty man held his arm out, and Jack grabbed it.The transport started to take to the air as the mech swung him up and into the ship.The strange mech shoved him into a seat beside him and said, Hold on.The ride can be bumpy and Dan is a shitty pilot.The pilot said jokingly, Im not a bad pilot.I purposely try to make you fall out.Then he looked at Jack and said, Welcome to hell.Im Dan.Thats Carlos.Jack said, Youre not the first to welcome me to hell.Yeah, but Im the first to mean it.Im Jack.Carlos roughly jostled his shoulder.Good to meet you, dude.The transport turned all the way around and took off quickly, pushing him back into his seat.Carlos smiled and said, I told you he sucked.Jack wanted to smile back, but he couldnt force it.He was terrified.Carlos tapped his chest.Wheres your number?I didnt get one.Carlos stared at him confusedly.You mean you failed the weapons deployment test?I didnt think that was possible.Jack looked at Carlos chest and saw the number twenty one written on it, faint but still legible.He already knew he was going to be the bottom feeder again, even amongst rejects.The ship touched down in a dune pocked area of desert.Some of the sand dunes were larger than any hed yet seen on the surface.It wasnt until he disembarked that he realized the hills were sand covered structures.He couldnt tell if theyd been covered intentionally or if sandstorms had covered them naturally.They werent exactly inviting.Carlos helped him down from the open hatch and waved for Jack to follow.Dan stayed behind to put a huge tan colored tarp over the ship.Carlos led him to the largest dune and kicked enough sand away to reveal a thick steel door.He swiped his palm across a reader off to the side and the door clicked.He shoved and it strained against him, metal grinding against metal as he bullied his way inside.The inside was well lit, but that was about the only redeeming quality about it.Several steel chairs were stacked against the walls.A gathering of four mechs sat in a circle around a big steel table, playing cards, ignoring him as though he wasnt their first new arrival in a very long time.Each of them had a faint number drawn on their chest plates.They were all in the twenties, meaning they were all at the bottom of their various classes.Jack was in good company.The far wall had a dozen recharging ports, but they hung out loosely, dangling by thick, brittle cables.The place was the opposite of what he had seen below ground in his old barracks.It was a dump.Carlos went up to the group playing cards and kicked one of their chairs.This is Jack.Hes new.They all turned and stared.One of them said in a female voice, Whats your malfunction?I couldnt get to my guns.What do you mean?I couldnt make my guns deploy.Ive never heard of that.You must be the worst reject weve ever had here.Carlos laughed, but he said, Leave him be.You all remember how frightening it was your first day here.Have a little compassion for a change.One of them punched him in the abdomen good naturedly and said in a baritone voice, Did you pick out a nickname for him yet?He couldnt get to his guns.We could call him Gunner.Carlos shook his head disapprovingly.He looked at Jacks chest.He didnt get a number.We should call him Zero.The table erupted in sophomoric laughter.Part 2:  Jack becomes Zero    Jack/Zero hung his head in shame.He had lost everything and now, it seemed, hed also lost his own name.Carlos came over to him and kicked him in the shin.Buck up, dude.We all have nicknames and most of them are as bad, or worse, than yours.From now on, Jack is dead.Long live Zero.Zero asked, Whats yours then?My nickname is Volts.These dicks call me that because I dont hold a charge as well as everyone else.I need to recharge twice a day instead of just once.That did bring a smile to his face.So everyone here is defective somehow?Carlos/Volts said, Yes sir.But at least we have a purpose.Not everyone is so lucky.Ive heard of recruits who keep churning in and out of training, never passing but never fully washing out.They are worse rejects than we are, if you ask me.Theyll never have a purpose.Zero nodded, unsure whether he agreed with Volts or not.The mechs before him hardly appeared to be purpose driven, but what did he know.So what should I do now?Make yourself comfortable.We have a shipment of food coming in a few days for those bastard training officers, and a few other supplies, but I can handle that alone.Since you cant deploy your guns we should probably get you acquainted with the ship mounted turrets.One of the mechs at the table whooped and stood up.He bowed low at the waist and said, Thank God.I thought Id be stuck with turret duty forever.He said to Volts, I want to pilot a ship.Volts shrugged.His metal shoulders made a creaking sound as they moved up and down.You can take mine for now, at least until I get Zero up to speed.Zero was already starting to like the nickname despite its obvious negative connotations.But he was nervous about manning a turret.That other mech sure seemed pleased to have him as his replacement.Volts said to him, Ill give you a quick tour.He pointed to the far wall and said, Those are our recharging ports.Theyre old and crappy but most of them still work just fine.This is our living quarters.Come on, Ill show you the rest of the buildings.If you get bored later you can come with me while I do a sweep for insurgents.Does this place come under attack often?Not really.But when it does were much better off if we see it coming.Weve lost some good men and women because they got caught off guard.I wont let that ever happen while Im in charge.A female voice at the table said, You arent in charge, Volts.That douchebag Davis is.Davis hasnt been out here in months and I could probably pinch his little head off between my thumb and forefinger.Yeah, but he could press a button and shut your mind off forever.Carlos shrugged again.Zero was getting the impression it was his favorite gesture.Cmon, Zero.If you let them, these jerks will waste so much of your time youll get nothing done.Zero smiled to the table, but they just turned from him and resumed their game.Zero followed Volts back out through the door.Volts said, We average an attack a month here, more or less.Ive seen two species since Ive been in charge.The first type only attacked for a few months before they decided to give it a rest.They were little orange dudes with triangular heads and no feet.I nearly freaked out the first time I saw one.The newest group hasnt given up yet, but they will.Theyre these spider looking things with huge heads and hairy backs.Theyre multicolored, like butterflies.We wipe them out each time they send a new wave.They havent been around in a while, so were probably due for another attack.But dont worry, theyre easy to defeat.Have you ever lost a battle to any of them?He chuckled.If we had, no one would be here right now.Like I said, theyre a mild nuisance at best nowadays.That was a relief.The wind had kicked up, sandblasting them as they squinted to see.Volts approached the closest sandy hill and dug out the door.He shoved it open with his shoulder and said to Zero, This is the armory, but it also doubles as a hangar.It sucks, because every time we open the roof for launch we have to shovel all the sand out that falls in.The space was big, holding a dozen crates of mean looking weapons, and four attack ships.Zero could only assume they were designed for battle.They were fitted with scores of guns each.Two of them housed a domed turret at the top.He would be working from within one of those turrets if they ever came under attack.Volts pulled two identical pistols from one of the weapons crates and handed them to him.We have no use for these things, so its a good thing youre here or theyd just go to waste.Zeros spirits fell again to be reminded he was the only one of them who couldnt access his own guns.But he was surprised to find that he already had a pretty good idea how to use them.He checked the chambers and the magazines for rounds.He held one up and aimed down the sights.Volts looked at him quizzically.Then he must have come to a realization, because he said, Oh, I see.Youre just finding out that you have built in weapons training.Most of us found that out the first time we deployed our guns.Youll find there are a few things like that.Its like your body has a bunch of subroutines that only kick in when you need them to.Zero nodded.It made sense now that he thought about it.Volts handed him a shoulder holster vest.Zero assumed it was supplied to supplement a mechs built in holsters, but in his case, it was all he would get.He struggled to put it on, so Volts helped him and then he took the guns from his hands and slipped them into their new holsters near his armpits.Zero felt like a fool even though Volts pretended it made him look like a badass.Dan peeked his head through the door and said, The scout ships all covered up.Im going to settle in for the night.Volts nodded.He gestured towards Zero.Were calling this guy Zero from now on.Dan shrugged.You know I hate the nicknames, dude.Thats because you got a bad one.He looked at Zero conspiratorially and said, His nickname is Piss pants.If Zero thought his new name was bad, this guys was worse.Why?Dan interrupted, My hydraulics used to leak.They sent me a new hose system and it hasnt leaked since, but that doesnt mean anything to these assholes around here.If they find a nickname that hurts your feelings theyll use it forever.Volts said, Ah, youre too sensitive, man.We only nickname the people we love.Sure, said Dan, AKA Piss pants, before he slipped out of sight again, presumably to join the others in their card game.Zero asked incredulously, They didnt wash him out for something as silly as a hydraulic leak, did they?No.He struggled with problem solving during gunplay.His software would override his own mind every time he was put in a battle simulation, even to his detriment.In combat, that can get you killed if the enemy were to figure out the programming installed in these mechs.Thats why he flies.If we put a gun in his hand, hed become an automaton and get himself killed.So hes not much different than me?Volts paused for so long that Zero knew he was trying to find the right wording to avoid hurting his feelings.He got quite a bit further in training than you did, but in regards to being worthless with a gun, youre right.If that was Volts letting him down gently, he was underwhelmed.Zero crossed his arms and tapped the pistols under his armpits.Now that I have these, Im back in business.He sure hoped he was right.He hoped he was now considered an equal.You have a lot of catching up to do, Zero.You didnt make it through even the most rudimentary training, but thats okay.Thats what youve got me for.Ill show you the ropes.He had lost a friend in Stacey, but he was starting to think hed gained one in Volts, and for that he was eternally grateful.You can join me in a quick scouting mission.Piss pants will be mad that were uncovering the scout ship that he only just got covered, but hell get over it.Hes been here almost as long as me, so its understandable when he gets all huffy.How long have you been here?A little over a year.Zero didnt really want to ask the next question because he was afraid of the answer, but he had to know what he thought.Do you think theyre going to give you your body back?Of course I do.They have no reason not to give it back when it has been fixed.There will always be burn outs like you to take my place down here.Zero nodded, hopeful that Volts wasnt just deluding himself.The scouting mission was dull as hell.Everything was tan from the overabundance of sand.They only knew where the entrance to the training center was because it pinged on the ships tracker.Otherwise theyd have missed it.They overshot it by a few hundred miles and searched for heat signatures and some other invisible trace signatures that Volts didnt make Zero privy to, probably to save time.They found nothing out of the ordinary.No alien invaders were camped anywhere near the training entrance.Volts explained to him that orbital trackers caught most intruders before they ever breached the atmosphere, but on a few occasions infiltrators managed to sneak past them.That was why they had to sweep the surface.Zero didnt care.If hed known it was going to be so dull he wouldve asked to stay behind with the others.Volts re swept the area and finally called it a day when the sun started to dip below the horizon.He touched down outside of camp and Zero helped him put the tarp back over the scout ship.This is Piss pants job, but Id feel like a dick if I made him do it again.Zero nodded, though he didnt care.His mind had slowed to a stop during the sweep and it would take more than conversation to wake it back up.Luckily, Volts did not disappoint.Just as they were finishing up, he heard a dull thud.At first he thought nothing of it, but as he walked around the ship he saw Volts body lying face down in the sand.He ran to him and flipped him over.Volts eyes were shut.He tried to jostle him into wakefulness, but he wouldnt stir.He grabbed him under the arms and dragged him towards the living quarters.Zero barged through the door dragging Volts and several heads turned their way.A female voice said, Shit.We need to hook him up quick or well lose him.She joined him and helped heft Volts huge overweight body to one of the dangling ports.She plugged him in and they rested him on the floor on his side.She asked, When did he conk out?Just now.We were putting the tarp on the ship.Good.Hell be alright then.Theres just enough juice in the back up to last an hour or so.If that ran out, his mind would evaporate into the ether and wed never get him back.Holy shit!Thats a pretty significant design flaw.Im surprised they didnt give him a different unit.They dont do that.Were all expendable, despite what theyd have you believe.Zero stared down at Volts and his heart nearly broke.He could die at any time doing a thankless job for a faceless corporation that was in cahoots with strange aliens none of them knew anything about, but he did his duty with a smile on his face and a spring in his step.Zero knew right then that he wanted him as a friend.Hed mature as a human being with Volts in his life.When he stood rooted to the spot for too long, she said, Dont sweat it, Zero.He does this all the time.Were all screwed up.Youll get used to it.He took a seat at the table.No one had invited him, but no one objected either.The cards were shuffled and he was dealt in without asking.What are we playing?The previous turret operator hed replaced said gruffly, Texas hold em.The cards were as large as cutting boards and made of thick corrugated cardboard.What are we playing for?Piss pants sat down with them and passed him a handful of steel rods.Bet with these.If you win you get to opt out of tomorrows sweeps with Volts.So Im not the only one that thinks the sweeps suck?The girl whod helped him hook Volts up to his port said, We all hate them.He volunteers every day, which is nice, but he needs a copilot to act as a spotter.If you win tonight, you dont have to worry about being picked tomorrow.How many sweeps does he do each day?It depends, but never less than half a dozen.Ugh.Im playing to win then.We all are.It had been a long time since hed played poker, but it came back to him after a few hands.The stakes were high.He wanted to win in the worst way.He didnt win at poker, so that meant he was in the mix to be chosen as Volts spotter.The girl whod helped him plug Volts in was nicknamed Eve, as she was the first female of their current group of rejects to wash out of training.Eve was nice, but he noticed a few melancholic moments from her during the game where she just stared off into space like her mind was miles away.The guy he replaced as turret gunner was nicknamed Twitch because every once in a while his limbs twitched uncontrollably.He was visibly flustered by it, but there was nothing he could do to stop it from happening.At one point he kicked the table over by accident.No one made a big deal out of it.They just flipped the table back over and dealt the cards all over again.It sucked, as Zero had had a decent hand, but he didnt want to be the jerk to overreact.It surprised him to find out that Twitch was their previous gunner.It was even more surprising that they were going to let him pilot a ship now that Zero had arrived.He had a lot to learn about their ways.The only other girl was nicknamed Creaker because her joints werent well manufactured.They ground together with a creaky metal on metal noise whenever she moved.She spent a lot of time filing at her body with a metal file and applying oil to her joints during the game.None of it made a difference.The last guy was Stomper.Wherever he walked he stomped the ground like a madman.At first Zero thought he was being an impetuous baby, until he noticed he did it even when no one was paying attention to him.Stomper was the conspiracy theorist of the bunch.Hed ramble on and on, putting Zero on edge but merely annoying the others.As Eve shuffled, he mused at length, If Earth is eight hundred years from here, and I left in 2227, then the corporation that sent for me must have already been set up for sixteen hundred years before I left Earth.You see, they had to have sent for me around the year 1427 for the ship to travel the eight hundred year journey to arrive on Earth in 2227.But that means they left Earth around 627AD to travel eight hundred years to get here by 1427 to send for me.Thats sixteen hundred years they were active before I ever laid eyes on a Beetar ship.That means they came from the dark ages.It makes no sense, if were to believe what Quiss told us.He said weve been working with the Beetars for years, but the truth is that we must have been working with them for millennia.Either that, or the trip isnt as long as weve been led to believe.Twitch angrily told him to stop scaring the new guy.Then he added, Your theories get more asinine every day.Give it a rest, dude.The Earth you called home is dead and gone.All the phony equations and theories in the world cant undo that basic truth.Maybe youre just too stupid to make sense of it.Stomper stomped away in a huff, or maybe it just seemed like he was in a huff because of the stomping.Zero couldnt keep track of the elapsed times so he didnt even try, but he was more inclined to agree with Twitch since despite his constant twitching, he seemed to be the more level headed of the two.The game resumed as though nothing had happened.None of the rest of them offered up their true names.They went by the nicknames only.Besides the initial introduction, he would always go by Zero while he was with them.It couldve been worse.They couldve nicknamed him Piss pants.Eve showed him how they recharged every night.It wasnt like at the barracks; they didnt stand against a wall.All of the ports here had wriggled free of their moorings with overuse and general negligence.He propped himself up in a sitting position against the wall with enough room behind him for the port.He picked out the best cable, but even that one looked like a piece of crap.He slid it into place in the center of his back and his thoughts disappeared in a flash of black.He woke up once during the night, but he decided there wasnt much point in exploring his surroundings.Everyone worth knowing was asleep beside him and the world was covered in dusty sand.It sucked, so there was no use learning any more about it.He sat still and recalled memories of Earth.That made him sad, but it mustve helped, because before he knew it hed fallen into a blissful sleep.Volts woke him up.Thanks for saving my ass, dude.I owe you one.Come on.Since youre the new guy, you can sweep with me today.He wanted to refuse, but it seemed pointless, and it might even upset Volts.But first we need to get cleaned up.The sand out there can wear out your joints if you let it build up.He nodded; hed already heard as much.Volts helped him to his feet and said to everyone in the room, Come on.Todays sand blast day.Zero followed him out of the living quarters.The wind had died off since last night and the sun was beating down oppressively, although he only sensed it rather than felt it.Volts led them to the smallest sand dune, kicked and swiped the sand away from the entrance, and walked inside.The building held nothing but a compressor and a coil of air hose.The mechs all filed in and the lights came on.Volts turned the compressor on.He made Stomper go first.Stomper slowly flexed his limbs and moved his joints while Volts air blasted the sand granules away.Stomper slowly spun on the spot as Volts worked.Then Stomper took over the air hose and it was Zeros turn to get clean.It went quicker for him, as he was apparently still very clean from lack of exposure.Then he had to man the hose and blast Eve.It went like that until Piss pants made it a complete circuit, hosing Volts down.Then Volts went around and applied oil to all of their joints.Eve followed behind him and covered the oiled spots with a transparent film to keep the fine sand from collecting and sticking later.Zero felt very low at that moment.This was his life and it was mind numbingly dull.He was a space robot from the future and he was bored out of his skull.The sweeps werent going to improve his spirits either.The first sweep was actually alright.They took one of the fighter ships instead of the scout ship.Volts let him fly for a few minutes.He was surprised to find how naturally it came to him, but then again, it was probably just programming.Then Volts showed him how to operate the roof mounted turret.He even got to let off a couple dozen rounds.His entire metal body shuddered with each successive round.It made the trip worthwhile.When they got back, he found out what Volts had meant about all of the sand having to be removed from the hangar.A ton of the stuff spilled inside when the roof opened to let them in.It took them an hour or so to remove it.Theyd barely made it through the door of the living quarters when a shrill siren clawed at their ears.A bright red light flashed and all the defense mechs tensed.Eve said, Its those damn spiders again.How many times do we need to kill those guys?Volts grabbed Zero by the shoulder and said, The sensors have picked up an incoming threat.Youre with me.Dont be nervous.Its like shooting fish in a barrel.Come on.Volts tugged him back towards the door and they went back to the ship theyd just landed.Volts said, Youre lucky, you know.I spent my first week here worried half to death about combat.It wasnt until after the first skirmish that I realized theres nothing to worry about.Youll see just what I mean.So should I shoot to kill?Volts smiled.Yes.Shoot to kill.Theyll be trying to kill us, so we might as well return the favor.The ceiling opened and they took off.Two other attack ships joined them, with Eve, Creaker, and Twitch in one, and Stomper and Piss pants in the other.Volts pointed upwards and ahead.There they are.Well intercept them before they ever get anywhere near the training camp.Its the spiders again.You can tell by their ships.He saw about ten small black ships descending towards the surface of Epigog.They were orbs, about twenty feet in diameter, studded with dozens of guns.They were fast little things, but the mechs ships were clearly faster.They were closing the distance rapidly.He was already settled into the turret when Volts said, Were in range.You can start to pick them off whenever youre ready.As if on cue, the other two ships with him started to fire.He focused on the closest ship and fired a quick three round burst.The ship evaporated in a puff of black smoke.A second later the boom of the explosion reached his ears.He was operating on some kind of autopilot.He was no killer.Hed never killed anything before, especially an alien advanced enough to pilot a spaceship.But here he was, blasting away at them like it was his sole purpose in life.It came naturally, like instinct, so he knew it was mostly built in programming driving his actions.But the regrets were his own.He saw one of the orbs coming at them directly, so he pivoted the turret and let off a hail of bullets until the thing blew apart.Volts whooped like a teenager.For all he knew, maybe he was that young.He hollered up at Zero: Good job, dude.Youre better at that than I am.He was pretty sure Volts was just bolstering his confidence, but he appreciated the gesture.Two more black orbs disintegrated and fell from the sky from the barrage of bullets loosed by his companion ships.The five remaining alien ships split up and came right at them from different angles.He aimed at the one heading directly for them and fired.It fired back, but its bullets, or whatever it was shooting, pinged off the outside of their ship harmlessly.When Volts said, Im gonna ram it, Zero panicked.He held the trigger and filled the sky with bullets until the little ship exploded in a fine mist of shrapnel.The other four ships fell out of the air around the same time.Some blew apart while others lost control from damage and plummeted to the surface.The threat was over.Volts was right.It was a cinch.The other two mech ships broke away and headed down.Where are they going?Theyre going to make sure there are no survivors.Shouldnt we join them?Were going to cover them while they work.They descended and Volts said, Keep an eye on the skies.He did at first, but he had a morbid curiosity about the landside destruction.Even from so high up, he was able to see just what an unfair advantage they had.The five mechs running around on the ground with their guns drawn were each larger than any of the intact alien ships.He saw one of his comrades tear a ship in half with its bare hands and fire off a silent round inside the cockpit.Besides that, it looked like the spiders were all dead.He double checked the skies, but they were devoid of reinforcements.The mechs on the ground got back in their ships.Eves voice came over the comm.Its all clear.Whos going to stay behind to make sure no others show up?He just knew Volts would volunteer them and he was right.Volts said, You guys can head back.Well scout and keep you posted.The two ships on the ground lifted off, turned about, and headed away.Zero came down from the turret to join Volts in the cockpit.Volts smiled when he saw him.That was some good shooting.Youre a natural.Thanks.Its all clear, but we have to hang back for a bit just to make sure.I understand.Thats how those damn spiders operate.Theyre small enough and sneaky enough to get past the orbital defenses, but too weak to put up a fight once they do.They hardly seemed like much of a threat.To us, nothing is a threat.Remember, the Beetars are the mightiest species around and were their enforcers.Were basically unstoppable.Do you think any more will come?Probably not.They send everything they have at us to try and overwhelm us.Ive never seen them hold back.Were just being overly cautious.They circled the crash sites of the spiders ships and then did a wide circuit around the entrance to the training camp.Zero manned the turret once more just so he wasnt caught off guard, but there was nothing to fire at.Volts was right; the spiders had sent everything they had all at once.It was eerie how easily theyd been taken out.They hadnt stood a chance.They must have known how futile their attack would be, so why did they do it?Did they really hate them so much theyd risk certain doom for the chance to kill them?Volts, satisfied that the threat was past, radioed camp.Its all clear.Were coming home.Eve answered.It took you long enough.Hurry back.Stomper thinks hes found something.Were on our way.They landed and cleaned away the sand that had fallen into the hangar.The ship was spotless.If there were dents or bullet holes from the fight, they were too small to see.When they got back to the living quarters, there was an eerie quality to the collection of pensive mechs.The others stared at them as they closed the door.Eve whispered, Volts, we found it, with a reverence that confused Zero.What was so important?Volts said incredulously, No way.Are you sure?Zero chimed in: What did you find?Eve looked at him suspiciously for a moment and then said, We found the kill switches in the suits.Volts added for clarification, Weve been searching for them for a long time.If we can circumvent the kill switches, then Delacourt cant threaten to deactivate us.Why do you care?Theyre not threatening to shut us all down, are they?Its not that they will do it, its that they can do it that bothers us.Who needs that kind of pressure?Who wants their lives in the hands of people who barely even care that they exist?He still didnt see what the big deal was, but he paid attention anyway out of respect.Eve stepped aside and they saw Stomper sitting on the floor with Piss pants in front of him with his back opened up.A metal plate, four inches thick and as big as the surface of a coffee table, was propped against the wall nearby.Stomper was pointing inside Piss pants back to show them what had him so excited.Volts moved closer, so Zero followed suit.Stomper pointed to a large strike plate with a thick contactor touching it.He tapped Piss pants on the shoulder and asked, You ready?Piss pants nodded, so Stomper gingerly pinched the contactor between thumb and forefinger and moved it away from the plate.An electric arc ripped from the contactor to the plate and then vanished when the contactor was moved too far away.Piss pants immediately shut down.Stomper saw Zero clench up, so he said, The back up unit will keep his consciousness stored for an hour or so before shutting down too.As long as we restore power before then, hell be right as rain.He allowed the contactor to slip from his grasp, and as soon as it hit home against the plate, Piss pants came back to life.Volts asked, What can we do to make sure that contactor never stops making contact?Stomper smiled like a lunatic.Thats the easy part.We could use a fat rubber band or a tiny weld spot or a piece of tubing tied in a tight knot.If we had any paper clips theyd work perfectly.Volts said, A weld is too risky.Its electromagnetic, so a weld could interfere with the current and interrupt the magnetic attraction.Ill find some rubber sleeves or something in storage.Get everyone opened up and Ill be back in a minute.Zero wanted to opt out.He didnt want these dumbasses fussing around inside his body.But he thought it prudent to go with the flow.Going against the group so early was out of the question if he wanted their acceptance, and he did, in the worst way.They all sat in a circle with their backs facing inwards while Volts went rummaging for something that might work.Funnily enough, Zero actually felt Stomper removing his back plate.But when he started rummaging around inside of him he felt nothing.Stomper gasped and stood up.Zero heard him whisper to someone, then two bulky shadows fell over him.He looked back and up at Stomper and Eve and asked, Whats up?Eve said, You dont have a kill switch.Thats good, right?Yeah.But why dont you have one?I dont know.Then he remembered Doctor Henshaw saying something about his group being prototypes.Henshaw might have decided to forego them in my group.He couldnt.The kill switches are their failsafe in case we go nuts and try to kill everyone.No one says it out loud, but we all know thats why theyre there.Then I have no idea why I dont have one.Maybe he put it in a different spot in me.Stomper said, You have a contactor and strike plate right where we do, except yours is a single unit instead of two.Yours couldnt separate if we tried to turn you off.Wed have to use a cutting torch back here to shut you down.Zero shook his head.Wasnt that a good thing?Wasnt he exactly what they were aspiring to be?If so, why were they acting so suspicious?Eve said, I wonder what the hell Henshaw was thinking.If Delacourt finds out about this hell have him executed.Stomper shook his head.This makes no sense.I might as well close him back up.That was music to his ears.Volts barged in with a fistful of rubber sleeves.He said, Whats wrong?when he saw the look on Eves face.Zero cant be turned off.Hes a new model or something.No way.He has to have a kill switch.Its a safety precaution.Henshaw would never omit such an important detail.He didnt.It looks like he designed it specifically so Zero could never be turned off.Volts adjusted quickly.Well worry about the ramifications of that later.For now, lets disable our own.He handed Stomper the bundle of rubber sleeves and Stomper went around the room securing the contactors against the strike plates inside each mech.With that done, Volts removed Stompers back plate and worked on him.Then the back plates went back on and the mood lightened considerably.These mechs must have lived in constant fear of being shut down, and now that threat was no more.Zero wished he couldve joined in their jubilation, but it turned out that, technically speaking, he was not the same as they were.He was a freak among freaks.The reject of the rejects.Before they started jumping up and down for joy, Volts dampened the mood by shutting down and falling over onto his side.Zero helped drag him to the nearest port and Creaker plugged him in.Eve said, He mustve overexerted himself.He usually holds out until later in the afternoon.Twitchs head jerked to the side uncontrollably.He asked, Did you guys hear that?Zero strained to listen.Sure enough, he heard a distant supersonic boom outside, followed by another.Twitch said, Were being invaded.Why arent the warning sirens blaring?Eve yelled, Man your ships!Zero, youre with me.If he could have, hed have shit his pants.
