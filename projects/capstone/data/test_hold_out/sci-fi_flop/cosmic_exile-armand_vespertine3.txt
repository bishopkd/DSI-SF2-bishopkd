Magnolia, I need to know if were going to crash into anything.Marc said.At this rate were only minutes away from the epicentre, Magnolia said.But Im not reading matter of any form there.Something has to be causing this thing, Marc stated.Drkp, you said you knew about this place.Do you know what this is?Im afraid that I do, he replied, not bothering to look away from his station.The gravity well were in belongs to an evanescent wormhole.Thats impossible.Naturally occurring evanescent wormholes are sub atomic in size, Magnolia claimed.Theres no way one this big could form on its own.Not only is it possible, such wormholes are constantly forming and evaporating in this region.Drkp explained.And they have been for nearly ten thousand years.Why only ten thousand years?Marc asked.The short answer is that we created it ten thousand years ago, Drkp replied.Why would you create a field of evanescent wormholes large enough to swallow ships in the middle of a dust cloud?Ilene asked.The wormholes were an unintentional by product, and theyre what attract dust particles to the region, Drkp explained.What we did was engulf a spheroid region of space roughly nine billion kilometers in diameter inside a specialized gravitational field.What do you mean specialized?Magnolia asked.It caused the space within to separate from the rest of the Universe, Drkp said nonchalantly.What?Marc asked incredulously.Thats impossible, Magnolia claimed.Thats the second time youve made that statement Miss Creek, Drkp said.Id like to remind you that without a complete understanding of natural laws, which no one has, one cannot say what is or isnt possible.Are you saying this wormhole will take us to a parallel universe?Marc asked bewildered.No.Thats not the right term at all, Drkp said.Like I said its only nine billion kilometers across, and it was originally a part of this Universe.Its merely a pocket of normal space we isolated from the rest of the Cosmos.Why?Was it some sort of experiment?Magnolia asked.No.Its a prison, Drkp explained.A prison?For whom?Marc asked.Thats a long story Captain, and Im a little busy at the moment, Drkp said.Just dont run any active scans when we get in there.I dont want to attract any attention.Magnolia, can you confirm that were being pulled into an evanescent wormhole?Marc asked.Yes, I think Drkps right, she replied.So we wont be able to come back through?Marc asked.Why not?Ilene asked.All evanescent wormholes are unidirectional, Magnolia explained.They only allow matter to travel one way.All the wormholes here are in coming.Nothing can escape from our prison, Drkp stated.Are you saying were going to be stuck in there?Helena asked softly.Not necessarily, he replied wily.What do you mean?Marc asked.It is possible to invert a wormhole, and the Deity has Humanitys most advanced hyperluminal drive, he said.I believe we may be able to use it to sufficiently distort the space within a wormhole to allow us to travel back out.How?Marc asked.Im working on that, but rest assured Im both an expert cosmologist and an expert on this prison, and Ive had nearly ten millennia to contemplate its weaknesses.Im certain that it is within this ships abilities to sufficiently manipulate a wormhole to allow us egress.Were going to be sucked in inside of a minute, Magnolia reported.Isnt there anything we can do?Only hope and pray that Ill be able to get us back out once were in, Drkp said.Ilene quickly briefed the newly arrived bridge officers, including Randi and Arachnid.Were going in!Magnolia announced.The Deity plummeted down into a tunnel of space over a mile across.Its nebulous walls were a dark blue, almost black, and seemed to be frothing with waves.Every so often they seemed to flicker, as if with sheet lightning, and the Deity would tremor slightly, as if there were thunder.A small point of bluish white light was visible in the far distance.In less than two minutes, they were on the other side.All they could see now was that faint blue light.Holy Mother of Christ, Magnolia muttered.What is it?Marc asked.Its, its just like Drkp said, she reported.Theres nothing behind us, I cant read anything more than nine billion kilometers away.Not just mass, but space time too.Its like the Universe just ends after that.What about that star, if thats what it is?Marc asked.It is sir; a white dwarf.Im only reading one celestial body, in orbit at around twenty AU.Its a type six Jovian planet, roughly three Jupiter masses.It has a ring system, but no moons.No moons?Ive never heard of a gas giant without moons, Ilene said.Neither have I, Magnolia said.A gas giant that size should have at least a hundred moons.Theres also something else orbiting at 0.02 AU.Im not sure what it is.Im putting it up front.The azure sun, greatly magnified, appeared before them in its own video window.It was encircled by a wisp like black ring, slowly spinning around it.Closer to the sun there also appeared to be at least several thin, rectangular panels in orbit.Its a ring world, Marc said in amazement.Sir, thats incredibly unlikely, Magnolia said.A ring world would have to be made of a material with a tensile strength greater than the nuclear force.It would take at least a transgalactic civilization to make such a thing.But even for a civilization with the extreme level of technological sophistication needed to make a ring world, the time, effort and resources theyd have to invest would be completely ridiculous, and vastly outweigh any conceivable advantages.There are few known civilizations capable of making a ring world, and none with any motivation to do so.Im pleased to hear you substituted impossible with highly unlikely, Drkp said dryly.But the Captain is correct.It is a ring world.So there are people living there?Helena asked.Drkp nodded.Trillions, he informed her.All Scraumudi,  All what?Ilene asked.Sir, somethings approaching us, Magnolia reported.Is it a vessel?Marc asked.Actually, it looks more like an animal, Magnolia replied.Im putting it on screen.They gazed upon the bizarre leviathan floating before them.It was covered in a blood red hide that seemed to quiver with life.At the aft were its long, curved tusks and the fragile skin between them.It was a ghastly sight.It looks like its surrounded by an aurora, Ilene remarked.That probably means theyre using an artificial magnetosphere to shield themselves from radiation, Marc remarked.That would imply that theyre a pre starfaring civilization.A pre starfaring civilization that made a ring world?Magnolia asked.Despite the apparent direness of their circumstances, a smile swept across Marcs face.I love this job, he said.How big is it?Nearly five times our length, and more than a hundred times our volume, Magnolia replied.Its the size of a Dreadnaught, Arachnid stated in awe.Permission to go to cold mode sir.Granted, Marc agreed.It was called cold mode because the ship was forced to essentially shut off its radiators in order to keep the shields up.The Deity ejected several tonnes of ambient temperature helium plasma, which it held around itself via a magnetic field.The magnetic field also kept the plasma from reverting to an inert gas.The complex interactions between the plasmas particles gave rise to countless localized repulsions and attractions.Any directed energy weapon that hit the shield would either end up being absorbed, deflected, or harmlessly diffused.The plasmas high frequency made it effectively solid, and the shield was fairly thick, so it was also effectual at preventing larger objects from penetrating it.The technology had evolved from the same artificial magnetospheres that now protected the alien ship in front of them.If the radiators were left on full blast, the plasma would eventually reach stellar temperatures.As such, the radiators had to be practically shut off, so all the Deitys nonessential systems were shut off as well, and various other counter measures were employed to cool the systems that were running.Even so, they could only keep their shields up for a limited time before systems started to overheat and break down.In under a minute an ellipsoid bubble of violet, translucent plasma surrounded the Deity.The ship before them was now obscured by a purple haze.Im compensating, Magnolia announced, and the screen adjusted the picture so it looked as if the shields were off.Is it a bioship?Marc asked.It seems to be a spacecraft, but its hull appears to be living tissue grown over some sort of metallic lattice, Magnolia replied.So, I guess so.That doesnt make any sense, Ilene claimed.Why would anyone do that?What possible advantage would a ship like that have over a real one?Well figure that out later, Marc said.How many are aboard?I dont know.I cant tell individual life signs apart from the ship, Magnolia explained.Theyre hailing us, Ilene announced.I think theyre sending us their Rosetta Stone.It looks like theyve already got a translation matrix worked out.I thought you said theyve been imprisoned here for ten thousand years, Marc said to Drkp.How could they know Hominese?I dont know, Drkp said at length, with grave concern in his voice.But if they do, I fear they may know a good deal more.The Rosetta Stone is active, Ilene informed the rest of them.A very Human sounding voice began to speak over the com system.Greetings, wayward voyagers.Can you understand me?he asked.Yes.We can understand you, Marc replied.Marvellous.Allow me then to introduce myself.I am Arch Lieutenant Levanoch of the Scraumudi Armada.This is my flagship, the Bloodwyrm.With whom am I speaking?he asked courteously.This is Captain Marcus Spencer of the Anthropic deep space research vessel Deity, Marc replied.Im very pleased to hear that Captain, Levanoch said with restrained jubilation.May we please have visual communications?Marc nodded to Ilene, who opened a video channel.There, can you see us?Marc asked.The great black serpent that was Levanoch appeared on the holographic wall.Helena could feel his animosity radiating from him, and he made her feel cold, like she felt when she was near a wicked spirit.To her, this being felt as if he were half dead.It was as if his consciousness was hardly bound to his brain at all.She thought he was more like a demon possessing a vacant body than a mind manifested in its own mortal brain.Only the oldest Reticulans she had ever met had such restless souls, souls that had been incarnate for so long they were just itching to forsake the flesh.She knew at once that Levanoch must be a very ancient being.For a second she was about to tell everyone what she sensed, but then realized how stupid she would seem saying that she didnt think they should trust the hideous alien monster.The rest of the crew may not have been clairvoyant (except Drkp), but they were innately suspicious of such an inhuman looking thing.Yes, thank you Captain, Levanoch said.On behalf of my people, welcome to our Abyss.Your vessel is most impressive.The last time I saw a Human you were only a Neolithic race.How youve grown.If thats so, how is it youve contrived a translation matrix between Hominese and your own tongue?Marc asked.Our Abyss is not entirely sundered from the rest of the Universe.Particles that are drawn in still remain entangled with particles on the outside, Levanoch explained.We are able to usurp those quantum connections and use them to monitor the transmissions of any starfaring race in the local group.We practically have an army of scientists whose job it is to decrypt the arbitrary signals each race uses to encode information.They steal cable?Ilene whispered incredulously.Marc shushed her.Your race has caught my attention over the last few centuries, Levanoch continued, disregarding Ilenes insinuation that he owed the Ministry of Telecommunications centuries worth of panplexus access, plus interest.Youve been venturing out into intergalactic space, exploring distant galaxies.Youre the first race from the Milky Way to do such a thing since the fall of the Eternal Empire almost a hundred thousand years ago.Subsequently, your stardrives are faster and more advanced than any other races in your galaxy, and your ship in particular has the most advanced stardrive of all.Thats why I brought you here.You brought us here deliberately?Marc asked.Yes.I learned from your panplexus that your trajectory would take you through our little wormhole patch.Weve had almost ten thousand years to study this place, and we can open wormholes whenever we want, wherever we want, at least within the dust cloud.I knew you were coming, and as soon as you ran aground I drew you in.Why?Marc asked.We cant create wormholes, only enlarge pre existing ones in the quantum foam, Levanoch explained.That was once our method of traversing cosmic distances.We can still expand wormholes to travel within our prison if we have need of such haste.Unfortunately, every wormhole that connects us to the rest of the Universe is unidirectional.They allow matter to enter, but they do not let it leave.But, according to my estimation, hyperluminal fields as powerful as the ones your ship is capable of generating could be used to inverse one of those wormholes.That would allow both of us to escape from here.The information I found on your panplexus was written for a layman.I have no use of it.What I require is your vessel.I need all the information on your stardrive.My crew will study your ship, and your crew will give them any assistance they require.Until we devise a means of escape, you will be our honoured guests, and once we do escape you and your race will have our eternal gratitude.An enticing offer, Drkp stated, stepping into the windows field of vision.But Im sure the Captains wondering what you will do once you are free.Its impossible, Levanoch murmured in disbelief.You, you cant be  Im afraid weve met before Levanoch, long ago in my youth, Drkp said.In fact, Im the one who gave you a name in our tongue.Im pleased you programmed it into your Rosetta Stone.Do you remember what it means, Levanoch?Of course.It means Ravager of Darkness.Its from a myth of your pre industrial period.Your pagan gods made a colossal flying serpent to punish the world for its decadence.It flew over the land and burnt everything to ash.The smoke blotted out the sun.The hero Avasil constructed a great ballista, and as the monster swooped down upon the valley of Calosyn, he fired a massive spear that skewered it through its heart.The gods took the carcass to the underworld, where it would lie until the End of Days, when it would be resurrected to destroy your people once more.I tortured you for information about your people for days, and all you would tell me were worthless myths!Myths are never worthless, Drkp told him.He turned to speak to Marc.I do not give names idly Captain.Ten thousand years ago, the Scraumudi were a civilization of marauders.Theyd use their wormhole technology to appear out of nowhere and launch lightning raids on advanced civilizations, overpowering them with nothing but sheer numbers and the element of surprise.Theyd take anything the deemed valuable and killed whoever got in their way.Sometimes theyd abduct people and torture them for information, as they did me, though few others ever escaped.They have no reverence for other Sapient races.They killed billions of people at the least, and may even have wiped out entire races before we arrived.Theyre the greatest menace to the Milky Way in recorded history.You mustnt aid them in escaping.Captain, youre a wise man.You cant honestly believe such obvious propaganda, Levanoch said.Im surprised he didnt say we ate babies.My people are not naturally occurring.We were made by another race, to serve them in a war.Were a race of bio engineered warriors, and thats all were really good at.When we achieved freedom, we had no industrial base.Thats why we started to use biogenic technology.Our masters had given us the knowledge to make others of our kind and to maintain ourselves.We used this knowledge to create technological analogues out of living matter, and over the millennia weve become most proficient at it.Even so, we needed to renew our resources, and since we were warriors the best way for us to do that was by raiding other races, I admit that.But we were only doing what we had to do to survive.We certainly never committed any genocides.Oh no?Tell them what became of you creators, Drkp insisted.They were our oppressors!We had the right to defend ourselves against those who would deny us that which is our right by the very virtue of our Sapience!Levanoch vindicated his people.But what of them Captain?What authority did they have to judge us as a race of monsters, and then condemn us to an eternity of exile from the Universe itself?We were not alone in condemning you, Drkp reminded him.When we began our campaign against your ravaging, every starfaring race in the Milky Way flocked to our banner.And even that wasnt enough to defeat us!Levanoch snarled at him.Captain, I give you one chance and one chance only.Surrender your vessel to me.Im sorry, but I do not have the authority to overturn the sentences of the Allura, Marc replied.I admit that punishing an entire race for what I assume were the crimes of only a few, no matter how heinous they were, does not seem right to me.However, its not my place to decide whether your punishment is appropriate.If the Allura ruled you must spend all of Time in this place, I cannot legally help you escape.Levanoch shook his head rancorously.You will lament this Captain, he said.He only just managed to maintain an affable tone, and he was obviously seething with rage.I bear you no malice, but I cannot allow my people to forever fester in this void.If you will not aid us of your own accord, I will be forced to seize your vessel.I will board it and detain your entire crew upon my ship.Come peacefully and you will not be harmed, but be warned that I will not hesitate to suppress even the slightest resistance.I will torture and kill if I must, for my people must be free!And you, Alluran.Once the Scraumudi are again free, every member of your kind will be taken back to our world, and you will be subjected to whatever we deem fitting reparation for your war crimes.You will all die weeping!His grotesque image was replaced with the grotesque image of his ship.Kumar, can we go to hyperluminal in this place?Marc asked  Ill have to get some readings and do some calculations first, Kumar explained.Then hurry.Head for that gas giant in the meantime, Marc instructed.Yes sir,  Why the hell are we going there?Ilene asked.Theyre good hiding places.If youre deep enough in the atmosphere you cant be picked up on infrared, and the intense radiation and magnetic fields scatter most active scanning beams, Marc replied.Well hide in there until we figure out what to do.Blades, I need you to delete all of technical data about our hyperluminal drive from our computer systems.Got it, she replied, setting to work on her tabella.Theyre following us, Kumar reported.Are their weapons charged?Marc asked Arachnid.I dont know, Ive never been in combat with a bioship before, she replied.The ship shook for a brief moment.Whatever that was, it had a lot of kinetic energy.It knocked off a hell of a lot of plasma from the shields.Id guess they can only take a few more hits like that before theyre ineffective.Return fire.Particle cannons; minimal yield.Target their weapons and thrusters, Marc ordered.The Deity had very precise control over its shield geometry, and could open small apertures to allow outgoing fire.The dual yield cannons fired twin pulses of hydrogen ions at nearly the speed of light.But when they came within a hundred meters of Levanochs ship, they seemed to evaporate.No effect.Whatever kind of shield theyre using it completely dissipated our particle beams, Arachnid reported.Try a torpedo then, Marc ordered.Target the back fins.There shouldnt be anyone in there.The silver torpedo flew towards the red Bloodwyrm on a blue flame.But as it drew nearer it slowed down, came to a stop, and was then pushed away by an unseen force.
