  Jack Peterson put his work boots on because he wasnt thinking.He wasn't going to be working anymore.He wasnt ever going back because dead men dont need money.He kicked them off and put on his comfortable shoes.It was scorching hot outside, so he went shirtless to avoid succumbing to heat exhaustion.He ate a protein bar for breakfast and looked around the apartment.Knowing he was going to die soon gave him a new perspective.The apartment looked foreign to him now.Empty booze bottles littered the coffee table from the night before.His dad would get over his hangover quick in the heat, though.It would ooze out of his pores under the unforgiving sun as he worked his long shift.He felt bad for his poor dad.He was a good man.A note on the fridge from him said simply: Jack, take plenty of water today and wear a shirt, for Gods sake.You'll get skin cancer walking around shirtless all day.That put a wry smile on his face.Sorry, Dad, he thought, but bone cancer got to me first.He knew he needed to tell his dad before it ate him alive, and it was going to break his dads already fragile heart.He lost Jacks mom to cancer right after Jack was born, and theyd both watched in vain as his older brother died of leukemia.With a family history like his, he should've expected the worst.He could only hope his dad didnt eat a gun after he was gone  Then again, worse things could happen, like continuing to suffer when all hope was lost.He took the bus to the doctors office.Hed be getting medication today.But not the good kind thatd fix himthe other kind, that would lube his transition into the afterlife.He got off the bus at the next stop.Luckily, it was downtown Milwaukee, so there was plenty to do for a young man running out of life.He could get high or drunk all day.He could make new friends or help the downtrodden.It felt so odd for him to know he had such little time left but not to know what to do with it.Hed have to weigh his options after seeing the doctor.He pulled his water bottle out and gulped down half of it.It was a hot one today.An old homeless lady, leaning against a storefront, watched him from the corner of her eye.She licked her lips and turned from him, too thirsty to witness his enjoyment.He walked over and gave her the bottle.She tried to thank him but he just walked away, leaving his bottle with her.She smelled like a landfill and it made him want to chuck up his own water.He checked his funds even though he always knew exactly how much cash he had on him at all timesenough for a sandwich, a fistful of beers, and a ticket back home.He stuffed the cash away before anyone saw it.Hed heard of people getting murdered for less.One guy last year lost his life because some vagrant wanted his shoes.Apparently, the shoes didnt even fit the murderer, and when he couldnt sell them he just threw them away.Life was cheap, but Jack still put a high value on his own, even though it had become a rapidly perishable commodity.He took the steps two at a time up to the doctors office.The building was covered in graffiti.He had to sidestep a bunch of homeless people on the way up.He was almost certain some of them were dead, lying on those steps, but he wasnt about to check.He got buzzed through the doors, and after following a winding hallway, took a seat in the waiting area.When the receptionist returned to her desk, she nodded and he told her who he was.That bummed him out because just two days ago he had been flirting with that same receptionist, and now she didnt even recognize him.Or maybe she did, but now that she knew he was about to die, he no longer mattered to her.He was the only person in the waiting room, so it kind of pissed him off that he was made to wait for an hour.Dying people should not have to wait around for anything.When the door opened, the doctor had the phoniest smile he had at his disposal pasted on his face.Jack followed him through to his office, where the doctor took a seat and beckoned for him to sit in the chair opposite.He didnt see any pill bottles around and that made him mad too.Hed better not tell him that he had to go somewhere else to have a prescription filled.His time was valuable these days.His name was Doctor Jacobs, and he asked, How are you feeling, Jack?Im dying.I know, son.But how do you feel today?I dont feel any different yet.I actually feel pretty good.Jacobs nodded and scribbled on a sheet of paper, clipped to a clipboard.Do you have any family?Just my dad.I havent told him about the cancer yet.Are you close to your dad?That question threw him, but he answered it anyway, if only to keep moving things along.Not really.I mean, hes a great guy, but hes always had to work so much just to keep a roof over our heads and food in our mouths.I hardly ever saw him as I was growing up.And now that I have a job too, we never see each other.Absently, the doctor mumbled, Thats good.He knew right then that this guy didnt see him as a human being.He didnt care that he was about to die.Jacobs put his clipboard down and rested his elbows on his knees in a conspiratorial fashion.He looked Jack in the eye, and that made him a little uncomfortable.He asked, What would you do to defeat the cancer growing inside of you?Jack sighed.You told me I only have a few weeks left.Im pretty sure that means the cancer is too widespread to stop.Jacobs smiled and said, Answer the question.Id do anything, of course.He was starting to get angry.Was he trying to sell him something?He wouldnt be the first doctor to profit from someones death.Maybe hed try to send him to some expensive retreat where theyd give him acupuncture and bathe him in incense as his life and his life savings slowly trickled away.Snake oil, dressed up as a miracle cure.Jacobs said, You can survive this, but it will require more of you than I think you can give.Now he had Jacks attention.This suddenly sounded legit.What would I have to do?Jacobs sat back and took in a breath.It cant be done on Earth, son.We dont have the equipment here to eradicate your cancer.But it can be done off world.Jack sat up straighter.Hed never been off world.No one had except for scientists and rich people.Maybe hed get to go to the moon or even Mars.Hed heard of a potential colony being looked into on one of the moons around Jupiter or Saturn, but that was a long way from becoming a reality.More likely, he was referring to a space station in orbit around one of the planets.It looked like his bucket list was about to get another checkmark if he played his cards right.Theres a machine that can regenerate your cells, but its on planet Epigog 31 out near the edge of the galaxy.Its run by the Securacell Corporation.Okay.He was telling him things he knew werent possible.No one had managed to travel any further than the Centauri system, the nearest star system, which was basically in Earths backyard in regards to the vastness of space.Hed never even heard of Epigog 31.It is not cheap to send someone that far out.Its not cheap to use that machine.How is it possible to send me to an alien planet?Technology hasnt even come close to that yet.The Securacell Corporation has technology that they do not have here on Earth.Jack shook his head.Why would a corporation keep technology hidden that would make them money if they announced it to the world?It made no sense, but he kept his doubts to himself.He didnt want the doctor to think he was more trouble than he was worth.What would I have to do?Youd have to give yourself to the corporation.So Id be some kind of indentured servant?I could do that.How long before my contract runs out?He was starting to get excited.This was an escape route that wasnt there just moments ago.Hed get to live.It wouldnt.If they saved your life, youd be expected to do their bidding for the rest of your life.Jack nodded, waiting for him to say more, but he didnt.Could he become a slave?Was it worth it?What would they require of me?Im not at liberty to say.But I need an answer now.The transport leaves in two hours.Are you kidding me?I need more time to think about this.I need to ask what my dad thinks.No time for that.Its now or never, kid.I cant tell you how fortuitous it was that you chose me as your oncologist.I cant begin to tell you how lucky you are that you werent late for our appointment today.The stars have aligned in such a way as to save your young life.Will you let fate save you?I guess so.Good.Sign these waivers and lets get you to that transport.The doctor drove him across town in his car.Cars were a luxury, but the man was a doctor, so he was probably used to such luxuries.Jack tried to call his dad to say goodbye and tell him he loved him, but he couldnt get a signal.By the time the car came to a stop beside a large aircraft hangar, he gave up and wrote a quick note explaining everything.He scribbled his own address on it and told the doctor to make sure it got to his dad.Jacobs promised hed get it there.Jack stepped from the car and took a deep breath.He regretted it right away.The air was hot and putrid and burned his lungs when he exhaled.He wondered if hed ever breathe Earth air again.Will I ever be allowed to return home?If Securacell wants you to, then yes.There were things hed miss about Earth, but not many.He missed his dad already, but when his dad got the note, hed understand that this was his only option.He was pretty sure his dad would rather have an absent son than a dead son.As they walked towards the big hangar doors, the doctor asked, Have you ever heard of stasis?Oh shit.Stasis was bad.Unruly technology with mixed results.When it went wrong, death was imminent and horrible.But if he didnt go through with this, hed be dead in a few weeks anyway.He said, Ive heard of it.I know it has faults, but they dont worry me at this point.The last part was a lie, told more to himself than the doctor.Good.Theres no other way to get to Epigog 31.Its too far out to live through the journey, so youll have to be put on ice.Ill need you to sign another waiver for it, though.You didnt really get put on ice as the doctor put it.But it was a popular euphemism and those things die hard.In reality, stasis was achieved by a cocktail of chemicals that induced rapid hibernation inside a perfect vacuum.The temperature did drop inside the stasis pods, but there was no ice involved.In this way, you could travel for years and only age by a few minutes or less.And the entire process was supposed to hurt like hell.Inside the hangar, Jack saw the ship that was to be his savior.It was big, about the size of a jumbo jet.But the doctor was right, the ship looked like nothing hed ever seen before, technology far more advanced than the typical Mars or moon shuttles.He could only imagine why the corporation was keeping its interstellar technology to itself.To his surprise, there were other people milling around, signing forms and talking excitedly.Doctor Jacobs whispered to him, Theyre all terminally ill too.Theyre all going for the same treatment you are.Jack hadnt even considered the possibility.In his imagination, hed be going alone.This made him feel a little safer in his decision.He filled out the stasis waiver without reading it.What did he have to lose?He was about to ask Jacobs how long the journey would take when a girl around his age put her hand on his back and asked, What do you have, then?He turned around.She was cute as a button, with fluffy blond hair and dark eyes.He said, Huh?and felt his chest tighten.He was a good looking eighteen year old, but he wasnt yet used to the attentions of the opposite sex.What is it thats killing you?Um, I have cancer.She smiled and said excitedly, Me too.Then she held her hand up for a high five.It was too surreal.You shouldnt congratulate someone for having cancer.He gave her a weak high five just because it would have been rude not to.She said, Look around this place.I bet no one in here is over twenty five.I think Securacell likes em young.He searched the surrounding faces.She was right.Im Stacey.Whats your name?Im Jack.She gave him a quick hug and walked away.Over her shoulder she said, Good to meet you, Jack.Ill see you again on Epigog 31, I hope.He awkwardly replied, Okay then.Um, thanks.Doctor Jacobs shook his head at him.Jack got the meaning: he was no Casanova.When the big door to the ship descended, the hangar went silent.Doctor Jacobs barely said, Bye, before leaving him to his fate.The rest of the patients started boarding the ship in single file, until half the hangar emptied out and he could only assume the people being left behind were all doctors or sponsors of some kind.To his horror, he saw Jacobs pull the folded note to his dad from his pocket, crumple it into a ball, and let it fall from his fist.Hed only met his doctor a few days ago, but nothing from their meetings wouldve suggested that he was so cold hearted.He considered getting out of line to chase the bastard down for an explanation, but he was being shoved in the back and there was no way to get out of the huddle.The dread grew in his heart until he got inside the ship.Then his focus changed in a heartbeat.The stasis pods looked old and in various stages of disrepair.How could they survive stasis in pods so filthy and overused?In fact, he had no idea how long theyd even be in stasis.How far away did he say Epigog 31 was?A handful of uniformed men and women awaited them inside the ship and assigned each of them their own pod.Jacks was a piece of shit.The glass faceplate had cobwebs across it and the metal body was rusting in spots.He quickly checked behind it just to be sure all the hoses were connected.The uniformed guy whod led him to it got agitated with him and shoved him inside the pod.Jack wouldve struggled, but it caught him by surprise.The guy slammed the door shut and then fiddled with some switches.Jack pushed against the door to test it, and sure enough, it was locked.The air smelled of farts and raw sewage.A wrapper rustled around beneath his feet, but there wasnt enough room in the pod for him to bend over to pick it up.It looked like a food wrapper of some kind.He watched as all of the terminally ill were ushered to their pods.He couldnt see Stacey.If he had seen her it mightve made him feel better about his predicament.For all he knew, the trip could take anywhere from a few weeks to several years.Any more than a few weeks outside of stasis would lead to his death from cancer, so the trip was probably at least that long, or else why put them under in the first place?But years in stasis would be equally dangerous.The corporation had better have advanced stasis technology too.To get them to a star system hed never even heard of could take thousands or millions of years using current technology, and that long in stasis was a frightening proposition.Why hadnt he asked the doctor about the duration of the trip before now?Maybe hed avoided asking because stasis was his only option and he didnt want it to be a poor one.He didnt know.He usually wasnt so careless.He yelled out when something sharp punctured his neck.A syringe.He tried to claw at it, but his arms were already going dead.He felt sluggish.His breathing slowed and he slumped against the wall.The back wall moved forward and held him up.A headrest pushed down on his head from above, holding it still.He felt the side walls cinch against him.Then his thoughts went out like a light.He was lying on a gurney when his eyes fluttered open.The bright light was obnoxious, so he closed his eyes again as tight as he could.Someone laid a hand on his chest and said something, but the words were all jumbled together, impossible to decipher.He drifted away lazily.He woke up with a start.His heart was racing and he was already sitting bolt upright.He looked around the room.It was small, white, and it was empty except for him and his gurney.The only door was closed.There was something ominous about that door being closed.Only then did his memories come flooding back.He had been revived from his journey across the stars.He was a bonafide space traveler now.The kindly face of an old man swam into view.He asked, How do you feel?Im starting to feel better.Im Doctor Henshaw.Do you know how long you were out?No.You were in stasis for a little over eight hundred years.Oh shit!He wanted to ask about his dad, but he was dead already if hed been asleep for that long.He wanted to ask about the state of the Earth, but couldnt formulate the appropriate question.It had been 2229 when he left, so now it was the new millennium; the notion made him queasy.He wanted to ask if theyd already removed his cancer.Instead he asked, How is that girl Stacey doing?Did she make it too?Doctor Henshaw looked at him quizzically.No doubt hed expected a more thoughtful question.I dont know who youre talking about, but if she came here with you, shes fine.He tried to sit up, but Henshaw put a hand on his chest.You need to relax.We still need to get you prepped for the operation.Henshaw was weak, but Jack lay back down.I thought youd cured us already.Youre still recovering from stasis.Well get to work on your cancer once were sure all of the chemicals are out of your system.Is this Epigog 31?I cant wait to see it.Im afraid youll have to wait to see the planet.Were in orbit around one of its moons.Then why did you wake me?I was supposed to stay in stasis until I got to the machine thatll cure me.Whats going on?The machine you speak of is here, on board this space station.Its a delicate piece of equipment that works optimally in low to zero gravity, so we cant use it on Epigog.Dont worry, youll see it soon.Then youll get to see the mother planet.He had no idea what Henshaw was talking about, but his mind was too foggy to dwell on it.Henshaw continued: If you ever get back up here, youll have to tell me about it.Ive heard so many wonderful stories about the surface, but I always have time to hear one more.Jack stared at him, trying to figure out if he was kidding.He wasnt.Why have you never been to the surface?Oh, Ive been in space too long.His bones must be too brittle or his heart too weak from zero Gs.But that couldnt be right.There was some kind of artificial gravity in the space station.Or at least there was in the part of it they were in.He could feel it.Henshaw mustve seen the confusion on his face.He said, I have no immune system.My body hasnt been subjected to the same illnesses and contagions that affect others living near one another.If my white blood cells ever had to get into a fight against a foreign contaminant theyd just roll over and give up.If I went to Epigog 31 Id need to wear a space suit to survive.Weird, huh?Jack wanted to tell him how awful he thought it was that hed never get the chance to breathe natural air or see a sunset over a mountain or swim in an ocean, but he thought it might upset him so he kept his mouth shut.How long have you been here?Henshaw ignored the question.He acted like he had work to do, but Jack suspected he just didnt want to talk about it.Henshaw said, Im going to administer a sedative to help you sleep.You should be fully recovered from stasis by the time you wake up.Ill check in on you from time to time and then we can talk some more.Jack felt a tightening in his veins, then his eyelids felt like they were made of lead      He was pretty groggy when he woke up the next time.His head hurt and he felt light and discombobulated.The sedative mustve still been coursing through his veins.His eyes opened mechanically, like they were being forced open by an invisible hand.He was in a different room than the last one, this one darker, with weird contraptions lining the walls all around him.His body was being held in a standing position, his head stuck in some kind of brace; he couldnt pivot it up or down.For a second he wondered if he was back in stasis, but that was stupid, because he was awake.He couldnt feel his toes, and when he tried to wriggle them he found he couldnt.Worried that he was paralyzed, he moved his fingers.The sound of a dozen miniature electric drills came to his ears.He didnt know what that meant, but he was relieved to feel his fingers moving.He tried to loosen whatever restraints had him fastened so tight to his upright moorings, but they held despite his struggles.He cried out for help, but the voice was odd.It was his voice, just more strangled and monotone than he was used to.He started to panic.He heard another voice cry out in the darkened room, from very far away.He turned his head as much as he could, but the darkness was too pervasive to make out who or what had made the sound.He heard a soft click and then his eyes slammed shut like a vise.He had only a second to ponder what had happened.A moment later his brain followed suit and shut down like an appliance.He awoke in a brightly lit room, all alone.This room was small, like a hospital room, with gadgets and medical crap all over the place.He was still anchored in an upright position, but he felt a little better about it this time.Maybe that was because he was getting used to it, or, more likely, because the lights were up.He heard a pneumatic door slide away and soft footfalls approach.Doctor Henshaws kindly old face swam in front of his view.How do you feel?He said, I feel like we already had this conversation, but his voice had that odd quality to it like before.Henshaw said sadly, You must be confused.I need to debrief you before I can let you down from there, okay?Jack nodded lazily.He had no clue what he was talking about.Your body is being treated as we speak, in the other room.Jack had to take a moment to make sure hed heard him correctly.What the hell are you talking about?Im right here.Your mind is here, Jack.Your body is undergoing treatment elsewhere.He wriggled his fingers again.Sure enough, he felt them move.Bullshit.I can feel my body.I just cant see it because youve got me latched in tight as a drum.Thats not your body, son.Angrily he blurted out, Then whose body would you have me believe Im inside?Not who.What.What?Ive uploaded your consciousness into a robotic unit.You can control it with just your thoughts.It has already been calibrated to your unique thought patterns.We call them mechs.Oh, for Gods sake, let me down.Ill release your head restraints so you may see for yourself that Im speaking the truth.Henshaw reached behind him and yanked on a cord.His head felt suddenly lighter.He was able to move it around now.Immediately he looked down, and to his horror he saw mechanical legs, feet, and a metal torso.He shook his head out of sheer confusion.The body was bulky, like it belonged to a giant.Henshaw said, Turn your head.Jack was staring off into space, disbelievingly.His mind wasnt ready for any of this.Do it.Try it for me.He turned his head because it was far easier to take directions than it was to try and unscramble the myriad confusing thoughts riffling through his tired mind.To his surprise, his head kept turning.He had to make a conscious decision to make it stop once it had made a full panoramic circuit of the room.It spun all the way around, like an owls head, except he didnt need to spin it back.He knew he couldve let it spin and spin like a helicopter rotor.Doctor Henshaw clapped like a child.Jack wanted to smack him in his kindly, eager face just to make himself feel better.Why did you do this to me?You belong to the corporation, mind and body and soul.Why let your mind fester inside a body thats undergoing treatment when they can evict your mind and put it to work?Because thats the sane thing to do.How long does the damn treatment take?In your case, itll take a while.How long?Maybe ten months, but if there are complications it could take as long as two years.So get used to your new body.Youre not going anywhere any time soon.I didnt agree to any of this crap!Put me back in my own body.Screw the procedure.Many patients say the same thing.It cost a fortune to ship your dying ass out here.No ones going to just fly you back to Earth because you suddenly had a change of heart.If you want out, well stop all treatment and allow you to live out your final days on this space station.Jack shook his head angrily.At least he thought he was conveying anger through his robotic features.He wasnt really sure.Henshaw said, This is part of the deal.When your body is cured, youre free to go.Its actually a good deal if you think about it.The corporation could have enslaved you for life and you would have probably signed on the dotted line anyway.In this way, you just have to do their bidding until your body is ready.Jack nodded absently.He was right.He had considered giving his entire life away in exchange for an extension.What do you think theyll make me do?Im just the technician, son.Thats way above my pay grade.I thought you were a doctor.Im both.But a mere doctor doesnt have the skills I do to extract and repurpose consciousness.I consider myself a technician first and foremost.Can I get down from here?If Im going to be stuck in this robot, Id at least like to test it out.He was amazed by how quickly he had attuned to his new predicament.But that was his nature.He wasnt exactly happy with the situation, but what choice did he have?Sure.Make it quick, though.The reprogramming session starts soon and you cant miss it.What the hell is that?It sounded bad enough to unnerve him.He didnt like the sound of reprogramming.Son, your world is about to expand exponentially.Your understanding of our place in the cosmos is about to grow tenfold.Reprogramming is just an academic way of saying you need to be educated in the worst way.Now Jack was even more nervous.Henshaw reached behind him and a moment later Jacks body dropped a couple of inches, his immense metal feet hitting the floor with a loud clang.He took a tentative step forward and heard those weird little sounds again, like a dozen miniscule power tools being used nearby.The sounds irritated Henshaw.This damn thing is too new to be making God awful noises like that.Give me a minute.Jack stood still as Henshaw injected lubrication all over his metal body at various points, paying particular attention to his knees and hands.He then got to work with a set of tiny screwdrivers, tightening here and loosening there.Within a few minutes, he said, Give it a shot.He took another step forward, but silently this time, besides the thud the footfall made.He flexed his fingers noiselessly too.Henshaw smiled and said, Wander around.If anything feels strange to you, let me know.I had some problems with the gyroscopes a couple of times, so let me know how your balance feels, okay?Jack walked back and forth from one end of the room to the next.He spun around quickly and paid close attention to his balance.The gyroscopes were working fine.Finally, Henshaw said, Time to get you to the session.Everyone else is waiting for you.As an aside, he said, Hey, that girl Stacey is there too.Shes a cute little thing.Now I know why you were so interested to find out about her.If Jack wasnt a robotic mech he might have blushed.But the embarrassment was fleeting, replaced by a steely dread that wouldve seeped into his bones if he had any.He had to live the next several months to two years as an appliance, albeit a pretty cool looking one.He didnt know how to process such bizarre information, so he just followed Henshaws lead and pushed his concerns to the darkest, most hidden recesses of his mind.He walked out from the little hospital room/mechanic shop and stomped along after the doctor.As they walked, he said, I thought you said Id be going to Epigog 31.Am I still going to go there?He was starting to think everything hed been told was a lie.He knew there was little he could do about it, but he wanted the doctor to be clear.Thats where your training will take place.As soon as we deem you fit to move on to the next stage, youll be taking a shuttle down to the surface.How will you know if Im fit to move on to that stage?Youll see.Theres always one who cant take it.That was an ominous thing to say, but it had him excited to see what was next.Around the corner, and at the end of the corridor, they halted at a doorway.Henshaw looked back at him, smiled, and then he opened it.Inside the large room was a sight right out of a horror movie.There were about two dozen massive robots in there.Jack jumped backwards with fright until he realized he was one of them.In fact, they all looked identical to him, besides a single variation in color.Some of them were silver and black, like him, while the other half were silver and blue.For the first time, he got to see Henshaw standing next to one, and he realized just how big they all were in comparison to flesh and blood people.They were massive, with feet the size of shoe boxes and hands as big as toilet seats.The mechs were all standing, facing the front of the room.Each one of them turned and watched as Henshaw waved Jack to a spot where he was expected to stand.He wanted to ask around and see how everyone was doing, but he got the sense they were all equally as mortified as he was, and therefore in no mood to make small talk.Henshaw walked to the front of the room and addressed them all.A representative of the corporation you all now work for will be with us shortly to debrief you.Jack nodded, as did most of the other mechs, but one solitary voice cried out in a monotone: I cant do this.I just cant.Someone has to get me out of this thing.Im freaking out in here.Henshaw shook his head sadly and pulled out a contraption.He scrolled around with his finger on a screen none of them could see, and then, right in the middle of his freak out, the mech stopped and his head hung low.Henshaw said, He isnt the first and he wont be the last.He will be reconditioned.He wont like how that feels, and neither will any of the rest of you should you decide you just cant handle your new situation.I hope the rest of this group deals with this with a bit more composure.You are all super soldiers.Act like it.A few heads nodded, but Jack was flabbergasted.What exactly did Henshaw mean when he said reconditioned?Had all of them already been conditioned for this before they were woken up?A woman in a pants suit walked in and all metal heads turned her way.She clearly enjoyed the attention, as she lit up with a big, phony, yet infectious smile.She waved the doctor off with a flick of her wrist and he obediently took one of two seats that were off to the side while she took up residence, front and center.Welcome, recruits.Your lives are about to change forever, andI hopefor the better.While we work on getting each and every one of your bodies back up to optimal health, we require your services.As you can see, youve been supplied with top of the line technology to enable you to flourish in your new roles as agents of the corporation.The corporation I speak of is Securacell, but since its the only corporation within several hundred light years, we all just call it the corporation.Feel free to do the same.A few heads nodded as she broke out that fake smile again.Once youre trained up, youll each be stationed throughout the quadrant.Some of you will pick up security details for various diplomats.Others will be required to maintain order on our penal colony.A few lucky fellows will even be given access to corporate headquarters to act as security.Heads nodded again, so Jack knew shed smile again, but this time she just looked them over carefully and continued.I am about to divulge information to you that few humans in the galaxy know.Im about to blow your little minds.Henshaw apparently took that as his cue.He stood up and walked past her, right out the door.She waited until he left, then she said, We humans are not alone in the universe.There are at least a dozen known intelligent alien civilizations in this quadrant of the galaxy alone.Now Jack was intrigued.Hed expected to one day hear about the discovery of intelligent alien life, but so far every probe and human excursion had only ever discovered sea foam and sludge and moss like crap.All mundane and pass.Yet humanity still held out hope that one day theyd find something more advanced, with a real brain.Apparently that day had come.She said, The best of all is this: we have made contact with one such alien civilization and it is friendly.In fact, we found that we have more in common with one another than any of our brightest scientists couldve ever imagined possible.They are bipedal, reproduce sexually, have a head with two eyes and a mouth, and their language is so structurally similar to human languages that they were able to construct translators so that we could communicate with them.A mech stepped forward and said, I might need to be reconditioned.Im freaking out here.Wheres Henshaw?She smiled ruefully and pulled her very own contraption out.She swirled her finger across its surface and the excitable robot shut off like its plug had been yanked.She said, Before I introduce the alien ambassador  does anyone else feel like panicking?A female voice called out, One of them is coming here?Is he dangerous?Will he kill us?She stared at the mech offender and then she shut her off too.Are you done?Can the rest of you handle this?They all nodded, even though Jack wasnt sure he felt altogether safe anymore.But what choice did he have?If he said he couldnt handle it, theyd recondition him and hed probably have to go through all of it again anyway.Plus, he had to admit, he was super excited to see what the hell this thing was going to look like.Loudly, she said, Were ready, Doctor.Bring in the ambassador.Only then did Jack realize shed never introduced herself, like they were somehow beneath her.Maybe they were.Apparently, there was a lot he still had to learn.That realization faded away when Henshaw came back and the beast followed him through the doorway.It was just familiar enough to be relatable, but weird enough to evoke a couple of gasps from the room.It was tall and bulky, and to Jacks surprise was wearing clothing, but not like any hed ever seen before.Its head was large and didnt seem to suit its body.Its skin was the milky blue color of a cloudy sky, and its eyes were far too big.The eyes were what most of the mechs were staring at in fear and shock.They were as big as footballs and so black it looked like someone could reach right into them.Its mouth was a mess.It opened and closed like a butt hole, widening and then shrinking to nothing.Inside was nothing that made much sense: no teeth, but a cluster of colorful bumps jutted from within where he expected to see only shadow and darkness.It had two legs just like the lady in the pants suit had said, but they werent exactly like those of a human.They were thick with musculature and segmented by way too many knees that made it look like it was bobbing along on a lazy river as it walked.Shed said they reproduced sexually, so Jack had to wonder if there was a weird alien dick where the legs met.It took her place at the front of the room and she joined Henshaw where hed sat down off to the side, placing her hands in her lap like a good little girl.The alien spoke and a part of Jacks mind opened up.Its language was a cacophony of hisses and grunts, whistles and squawks.Somehow it managed to make all of those ragged sounds seem melodious, but they were absolutely foreign to Jacks ears until his robotic programming opened a hole in his mind and translated for him.The guttural alien din soon coalesced into words he was starting to understand.It said, Can you all understand me?It was a stupid question, because how could they respond if they couldnt?It repeated, Do you understand me yet?Jack nodded because he didnt know what else to do.Others soon followed suit until the entire room was full of nodding mechs.Good.Im the ambassador for my people on this space station.We call ourselves Beetars.My name is Quiss.Welcome, recruits.Lets get all of you up to speed.The mechs all nodded again, completely dumbfounded, and it continued.My race controls this quadrant of space.We are a peaceful species and weve been working hand in hand with humanity for years.We have a harmonious, symbiotic relationship with your people which has only grown stronger the longer it lasts.The lady in the pants suit smiled like a lunatic, which couldve made Jack uncomfortable, but it did the opposite.It put him at ease, because she adored the damn alien.If she adored it, maybe it was okay.We Beetars maintain peace even when warlike races rear up in our galaxy, hell bent on conquest and destruction.We bring order to chaos.Ultimately, its our goal to further our knowledge by exchanging ideas and philosophies with all species we come into contact with.Humanity approached us with similar ideals, so here we are, working together for the betterment of all.A mech yelled out, Which planet are you from?Quiss smiled, which wouldve made Jack puke if he had a stomach or the contents to puke up.It wasnt gross; it was just too odd for his still stunned brain to accept.Quiss said, We do not divulge our planets location to anyone for fear of reprisals.We often have no choice but to maintain peace by force.There are terrorists who would attack my planet if they knew where to find it.But were not terrorists.I know that.Youre the closest thing we have to like minded allies.But we also have a long tradition of secrecy that has served us well.Perhaps in time well divulge the location of our home world to mankind, but today is not that day.That made sense to Jack.If all the jerks in the galaxy wanted to take a potshot at you, it was probably best if they couldnt find you in their sights.Quiss said, You are here so that we can heal your broken bodies.While our machinery works its magic, we ask that you repay us in kind with your service.I believe thats a small price to pay for an extension of life.The mechanical units you are inside right now were designed by my people and then tweaked to perfection by your own scientists.You are in control of the most formidable war machines in the known galaxy.I hope you appreciate the gravity of that.Jack wasnt sure he did, but he nodded anyway.Quiss continued, Most of you will repay your debt with menial guard duty or a few high profile security details.A few of you will qualify for corporate privileges, whereby youll be allowed to serve out your terms under the protective umbrella of your Securacell corporation, guarding sensitive areas and protecting high ranking corporate officers.It paused and looked at each of them in turn.Two of you lucky humans will be stationed on my warship to act as hired help.The pants suit bitch stood up and clapped.
