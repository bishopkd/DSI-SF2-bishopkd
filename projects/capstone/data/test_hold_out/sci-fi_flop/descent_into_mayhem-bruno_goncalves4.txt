..he admitted, glowing scarlet with embarrassment, the newly weds are living in it for the rest of the week.I was wondering whether I could use your room, sir ...Hmm.My room has too many ears surrounding it.Lippards room, however, is near to the reactor.Which do you prefer, a silent audience or a noisy reactor?Most definitely a noisy reactor, sir.Wont Lieutenant Lippard object to this?Why, of course not, my dear sergeant, Kaiser scolded, as if the soldier was a fool for considering it.I and my better half do not mind an audience.Not even a noisy one, for that matter.Besides, she is out at the moment, which is why I am up so early.Enjoy, he finished, slipping him his partners access card as if he were trafficking forbidden substances.The sergeant thanked him, promptly declaring that if there were anything he wished for in return, he needed only say so.Kaiser smiled and patted his back.As Mateus was about to leave, however, Kaiser took him by the shoulder and drew him close.Pictures.I want pictures, my dear sergeant, he whispered, his expression dead serious.The sergeant laughed, not quite entertained, not entirely comfortable.He nodded curtly and promised there would be if she was willing, and went on his way.Thinking of the fun he and Lippie could soon be having with the photos, Kaiser returned to his journey to Ebony Towers primary situation room.Despite his rank and credentials, the commander found himself once more the subject of an interrogation protocol.The Towers security personnel were an independent structure answerable only to the Executives, and they knew it well.Four ISB soldiers manned the operational headquarters main access point.He was searched with the respect due to a man of his rank, and so he did not get a hand to the crotch, nor was he obliged to remove his shoes.As soon as the reason for his visit had been established, the commander was allowed to enter the room.The Situation Room was the single largest division within the Tower, and its organization was evident from where he stood.The room was circular in conception, with the outermost ring acting as a corridor, from which walkways descended towards the floor.The innermost area, known as the tactical floor or more aptly as the arena, was the domain of Tactical Command.The arena was cluttered with luminous panels displaying ongoing events in exquisite detail, and complemented by a host of tacticians manning consoles.Presiding over them were the commander and his vice, both far too busy to receive him at the moment.The intermediate ring was cut into four sections by the descending walkways.The two rightmost sections comprised ground and air support.The opposing side comprised logistics and resupply, and an odd section where the personnel appeared to be slumbering.It was that section which Kaiser approached.By all outward appearances the least busy of the bunch, Strategic Command nevertheless possessed the authority to overrule all other departments.Except for the Executive Council, of course, whose august members were still safely in orbit.He approached the nearest of the seven strategists.The man in the reclining chair was old, his grey locks curling around an ancient pair of earmuffs, his eyes hidden beneath a frilly sleep mask clearly not originally his.Gently raising one of the earmuffs, the commander spoke into the elders battered ear.Ah, mein hengst, how I long to feel your rippling muscles between my sweaty thighs.You stud, you dominant stallion, how great is my urge to ride you, to pull at your crest, to pull at your   Alright, alright, you trash talker, Im up, the old man muttered irritably, pulling the sleep mask up to peer at the grinning German.He shook his head at his visitor.Theres nothing more upsetting than that kind of mental contamination, German.I am connected to my fellows, and I felt the turbulence in them as soon as you began to speak, he declared, distancing the back of his head from the interactive induction plate before any more contamination could take place.Ah, but that begs the question, my dear councilmember, Kaiser countered.Has my contamination perhaps begun to wet the thighs of the Frau Wenger beside you.Might I cop a feel to verify?The old man began to chuckle.He stifled it quickly and directed the mobile Suit commander away from his fellows, sparing a glance at the restless Lady Wenger, who had begun to display a distinctly unsettled expression.They settled down on a bench in the quarters rest space and silently watched the arena as events unfolded.Things were clearly becoming ugly at the plantation.So, having trouble sleeping, are we?the strategist began.Yes, councilman, I am.It mystifies me.Despite not having any real reason for it, I have been having nightmares.Perhaps your conscience is not clear.Kaiser laughed.I hardly have a need for a conscience, old man.In any case, that is not why I interrupted your work.Certain unnamable people have informed me that certain devices have been removed from storage.Devices?I know nothing of such things, the councilmember answered amiably enough.Kaiser insisted.Certainly I believe you but, taking into consideration the nature of these devices, as well as the highly qualified personnel who are prepping them, I must say   Alright, Kaiser.Lets assume your information is correct, for the sake of discussing a scenario, if for nothing else.Why would this be the business of an MS commander such as yourself?Kaiser smiled without humor.Because the last time you strategists made foolish decisions, I spent the four following years stuck on Mars cleaning up the mess.I guess you forgave your own mistake a little more easily than I did, councilman.The strategist deliberately avoided Kaisers eyes, focusing instead on the activity in the arena while the commander breathed heavily beside him.After a while, when Kaisers body was no longer taut with sudden anger, the old man turned his face towards him.This is not Mars, Tommi, he finally said.Those chappies always knew wed be knocking at their door sooner or later, so they made arrangements outside of our projections.These colonists, on the other hand, dont even know we exist.Which is why the operation at the plantation is so vital to our future.If even one of those miners manages to slip free, will there be any reason not to hit them with everything weve got?Attacking before weve accumulated enough resources may be bad, but it is still better than being attacked under similar circumstances.Even if theyre not annihilated, the knockout will keep them on the carpet long enough for us to get up to speed.Do you have any sound reason to counter that, commander?Yes, although your ability to understand my rationality is questionable.Youre speaking with the senior strategist of this mission, Kaiser!Do you   Thats exactly my point, my dear councilman, Kaiser countered.You have a very high opinion of yourself, at least for someone who has never hung from a monsters teeth as a consequence of foolish decisions.Which is more dangerous?An army of a thousand before the first hammerblow of war, or one of five hundred after their families have been slaughtered?Your first mistake is presuming your attack will have the knockout effect you desire so much.Such an evaluation is not a matter of mathematics, it is instead one of gauging this countrys fighting spirit.That is why I have insisted so much on taking prisoners, to interrogate them, to understand them.Without knowledge of such a variable, how can you possibly expect to predict the outcome of attacking their capital?All I can say, Kaiser, is the following.Pray, if that is something you do, that prisoners are taken and no miners escape.Otherwise our course is set.Kaiser shook his head, wondering how such intelligent men could be so blind.He made one last attempt to explain.Let us imagine for a moment, my dear councilman, that you are one of these colonists.Some futile government service sends a group of miners and agricultural engineers to this remote plantation.After some time has passed, they realize there is no word on the miners.There is no habitation near to the mines, nor any military structures, and so there are no locals to establish contact with.They promptly presume that something of a technical nature has gone wrong.After a while, drones are sent out to locate the convoy, and these drones mysteriously fall out of the sky.After even more time has passed, they finally realize that an enemy exists to their south east, and the army, there is always an army, of course, is notified.A mission is sent, and it does not return.A larger mission is sent, and it does not return.After a while, fear becomes a physical thing to them, and they will begin to see these events as disasters.Their fear will keep them from wishing to move to the south east.The mines will be considered lost, and they will begin to prepare their defenses, to prepare their army.But here is the most interesting part, dear councilmember.Because the armys command structure never received any real feedback from their lost forces, they will have no idea of how strong we are, how strong we have in the meantime become, or the nature or origin of our strengths.Such commanders will inevitably make the wrong decisions.They will remain a primitive force for not having been forced to evolve.And because of this, when we finally attack in full strength, they will be completely overwhelmed.With no need, I might add, for murdering their families beforehand.Between the two possible scenarios, attack or not attack, the second of these is much more attractive to I, the warfighter.Casualties will be lighter on both sides, and victory will be certain.The strategist nodded his head slowly as he listened, appearing to seriously consider Kaisers words.Once the officer had finished, however, he countered.As I thought, Kaiser, you have misunderstood our predicament entirely.The decision to attack or not attack is not simply a matter of strategy.It is a bureaucratic inevitability, much more connected to the way we operate than to any other variable.I may understand what youre saying.You may understand what youre saying.But our leadership is a strange democracy, as is our strategic council.And the fact that we can occasionally swim in each others minds does not change matters significantly.When in council, we can trade information visually and abstractly, even, but emotions are a different matter.Your reasoning is deeply connected to an emotional understanding of how people think and feel, and that is precisely the most difficult thing to directly transmit when in session.People tend to shy away from each others emotions.After all, there is something inherently threatening about the direct insertion of emotional concepts into other peoples brains.Information with no emotional charge is much safer, since we all have our own sacred cows enshrined in our heads, and nothing threatens these as greatly as emotions do.There is a saying by the classical philosopher, David Hume.One of my favorites, for that matter.Reason is, and ought only to be, a slave to the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.I like his words, and not because there is anything poetic about them.I like them because theyre true, and I know theyre true because of my occupation.We have crossed the infinity of space and many of us feel very small.We have established ourselves on a planet with the intent of annexing it in Earths name, and many of us feel afraid because we know were intruders.And fearful people are not receptive to new and unusual emotional concepts, especially not when these are presented with the aim of suppressing ones instinct to attack for fear of being attacked.They wont change their minds, nor will they accept the unusual reasoning you have to offer.Only the complete destruction of the convoy might give them reason to pause, but even then they must know there will be follow ups.All you will have for your efforts, dear Kaiser, is my vote and my attempt to dispassionately reason with fearful people.I have long given up on trying more advanced methods of thought transmission.The emotional whiplash one receives in return nearly destroyed me once.I have learned my lesson.The strategist became silent, and he returned to his attention to the events at the arena.There were plainly no survivors at the clearing, and Kaiser was thankful for that, despite the lack of prisoners that entailed.He observed from a birds eye view as Lippard approached the location where the drone had pegged the fugitive truck, his paramour certainly as aware as he was of the need to dispatch all civilians before any could escape.The fate of the planet hung on it and, after all, a small dose of genocide could perhaps prevent a larger one from taking place.That was how vaccinations had originally worked, or so he had read somewhere.The commander sensed movement to his rear, but decided to ignore it.Moments later someone politely cleared his throat.The deep rumble confirmed Kaisers suspicion.Turning towards the ISB officer, Kaiser presented him with his brightest smile.The officer rewarded him with a humorless grin.Excuse me, commander.I trust the motive for your visit has been satisfied?he declared.Kaiser sighed and thought on the matter.He then nodded curtly and bid the strategist a good evening.Its morning, by the way, the officer corrected.The director of strategy should return to his post.Ill accompany you to the door, Commander.Shortly afterwards, Kaiser was stalking along the corridor, his mind racing as he considered what needed to be done.Making a quick decision, he made for the armory.The installations occupied the towers entire second level, the first two levels being accessible by stairs or, alternatively, through the chute and pole rig that had been the main highway in microgravity.Kaiser naturally used the firepole, his inner child overruling any concern he might have had for doing the stunt under the intense gravity, and he reached the second level in an instant, coming face to face with an ISB checkpoint at the armorys only entrance.Their presence did not bode well for the future.He put on his brightest smile and approached the Principal Chief in command of the checkpoint.The chief smiled back, and Kaiser suddenly knew the guard had already been contacted by his superior two floors above.Kaiser widened his smile for good measure.Good morning, Chief, I hope you would not mind me visiting my armorers.We have been having some problems with our platform safeties ...The chief nodded amiably enough.I see, commander.As much as it pains me to, I am unable to allow you to pass for the moment, he explained with exaggerated pain.The armorers are at the moment tasked with an important mission, and until its conclusion they will not   The double gates opened behind the chief and a specialist exited at once.As all lay their eyes upon his wiry frame, he stopped, planted his hands on his waist and sighed heavily.Done.he declared.And Im also done for the day.You may all go fuck yourselves.The specialist took off at a stroll, the ISB personnel daring only to raise their eyebrows as he passed them by.Kaiser gave the chief a farewell nod and followed the departing soldier.He caught up with him at the elevator.Specialist Tarento, I am told our cooks foolishly left their desserts unguarded   No, Commander, I will not go on another adventure with you.Ill go to the belvedere.If you like you may accompany me, and then perhaps we can have a conversation.I would enjoy such a conversation, if the belvedere wasnt tapped.The reactor, however, isnt.We   Is this corridor tapped?I think not.The specialist leaned close and whispered.What I have to say wont take long.The number of devices they had us prep goes well beyond tactical use.They are committed to some more strategic objective ...How many?Kaiser asked.All of them.Forty units have been tasked to Tactical Command.The remainder are with strategic.Didnt you say you were going to do something about this?Kaiser felt an upwelling of emotion he had only ever felt before in that most unpleasant dream.He smiled automatically, but no answer was forthcoming.Tarento shrugged.Theres no reason to get too emotional about this.Its mostly humans who are going to die.There are already too many of those in the universe, I think.Yes, my kinder, but what cries they make when they expire, Kaiser sighed.SEVEN      MEWAC  SIC installations, 10H40, 21th of April, 2771      I would like to congratulate every one of you for having made it this far, First sergeant Abner stated, the platoon seated before him observing impassively as he rocked on his heels.I only hope that you dont relax your present rate of progress.Youll be spending quite a lot of time with me from today onwards, after all.Now that your basic training is over we can focus on the more relevant part of the program.Just never forget that you are no longer recruits, but sergeant cadets instead.I expect you to act accordingly.Their physical training must have been harsh this morning, he thought as he took note of the platoons lack of enthusiasm.All wore flushed complexions, especially the attractive cadet up front, her finely chiseled cheeks still glistening with after shower sweat.His loins tightened a little at the sight, letting him know that it maintained its own selfish agenda.An outburst of coughing among the cadets brought him back to the present.The sergeant frowned at the noise.Lieutenant Templeton liked to exercise his personnel vigorously, but Abner was going to need the cadets full attention.He made a mental note to have a conversation with the lieutenant about that.So, what did we do for exercise this morning?he asked.There were a few smiles, some of them more akin to grimaces, but only one cadet chose to answer the question.He was a big lad whose elbows angled out from his torso by virtue of his overdeveloped muscles.He even seemed to sit a little taller than all the others.It was only a run, sir, he replied simply.Its never just a run with Lieutenant Templeton, is it, Cadet, uh, Winters?Must be tricky to take a jog in the midst of the Winds, eh?the sergeant retorted.The group rewarded his attempt at humor with wan smiles, but quickly returned to their neutral expressions.There didnt seem to be any clown in the group to complicate future lessons.He looked at the two empty seats in his classroom and wondered if maybe that was the reason why.Very well, then, he said, returning to his introduction.I am First sergeant Tolerance Abner and I work in the Armored Suit Companys Repair and Maintenance Section.I have held the position of assistant chief there for the last eight years, although Ive since been temporarily transferred to the SIC for the duration of your training.I trust you all know why?There were a lot of nods across the room.Of course they know, he thought.It was certainly in their best interests to know.Aside from a two week interruption for rest and recuperation, the rest of their time would be spent learning to drive armored Suits proficiently as well as fight in them.In late November, the platoon would be subjected to a very rigorous evaluation, and only its most capable members would be selected to carry on with training over the following year, bearing from that moment onwards the rank of officer cadet.The rest would be enrolled into the ASC as sergeants at arms.The youngsters before him were thus competing for the privilege of officer status, as all were by now fully aware.In fact, if the cadets were unable to achieve minimum proficiency requirements by the end of their training, they would not be enrolled in the ASC at all.In your desk compartments youll find two items weve seen fit to assign to you, he continued.The first is a paper support Instruction Manual for the MoCa TRI Training Suit.The second is a pen key specifically coded for each cadet.However, before you remove them you are first required to access your military accounts, where youve already received a message containing your pass code.Do so now.As the cadets raised their display screens and began to tap at the options present there, Abner paced along the aisles, looking about to ensure they were not having trouble with the system.Before long, however, a beefy hand shot into the air.Yes, Cadet Winters.What is the problem?Sir, my code isnt here, sir, the cadet replied.Speaking loudly so the entire class could hear, Abner pressed him.Cadet Winters, can you read what is written at the top of the message?Yes, sir.Could you please read it aloud?The cadet hesitated for a moment before reciting the message.Sir, it says Place eyes directly before screen and approximate.Yes, Cadet Winters, that sounds about right.And why didnt you do that?Uh, sir, theres nothing below the messages heading.Its blank, sir, he declared, checking again to make sure that it hadnt popped up while he was speaking.Ladies and gentlemen, Abner began, speaking to the ceiling as he paced steadily among them, for security reasons, only a reader facing this particular monitor directly and at a distance of fifteen centimeters or less will be able to observe the pass code.This is so the person sitting next to him wont be able to access his user profile.Had you accessed the message on any other type of monitor, you would not have been able to do this.Please do as the message says.Fourteen cadets craned their necks forwards at the same time, trying to memorize the eight digit pass code that had magically appeared before their eyes.Abner didnt care to smile; the scene had long ago ceased to have any entertainment value for him.Moments later, all leaned back into their chairs with concentrating looks on their faces.All memorized?he asked.There was a general yessir in reply.Good.Close the message and logout.Once youve done so, I want you to close your display screens and raise the top of your desks.Touch nothing in there until I say otherwise, he added.Before long the cadets were awaiting further instructions, the desks interiors exposed before them.Not saying a word, Abner began to pace along the aisles again.To the upper left side of their interiors, each desk contained a detachable turn key jacked into its keyway.Twisting each to the side and pulling upwards, he removed them one by one and stashed the lot inside a pouch.Just to be certain, he removed the turn keys from the vacant desks as well.Anything worth doing is worth doing right, he considered.Depositing the pouch inside a small built in safe behind his desk, he turned to his class once more.To his dismay, the silence was no longer complete.A lanky youth with an irreverent air and hair a little too long and wild to be allowed was whispering to the cadet seated beside him.Abner glowered at the pair, earning only a cheeky look from the youth in return.His partner looked far too tired to care about the consequences of such cheek.He decided to ignore them and addressed the class instead.What I just did was physically cut each work station off from the General Military Network.As it happens, this room is the only location outside MEWACs Suit installations where one is permitted to handle the information contained in your pen keys.These terminals are also used for other purposes, however, and so they possess a physical cutoff option.If any of you are wondering what would happen if you accidentally leaked information about the Suits to the civil web, its my pleasure to fill you in.At best, youd be subjected to basic disciplinary action, and at worst, youd be court martialed.And, as you know, in a state of war, a deliberate leak carries the possibility of the death penalty with it.You may now remove your manual and pen key, Abner instructed with a grim smile.He then fell into a brief explanation of how the pen key worked and how it connected to their work stations.He does, doesnt he?Ray insisted, sparing a spiteful look for the instructor as he carried on obliviously with his explanation.Sounds like a real pussy, doesnt he?Preachy pedantic prick, isnt   Keep talking and youre gonna get us both in trouble.Ive had enough of that lately, dont you think?Rays eyebrows twitched at the rebuke but his recovery was lightning quick.He was soon scrawling a message on a piece of paper no doubt addressed to the back of Gordies head.Toni returned to his manual and flipped through its first few pages, taking the moment in which Sergeant Abner was explaining something to Sueli to satisfy his curiosity.He felt a bump on his shoulder and turned to find Ray mouthing Porker repeatedly while gesticulating at the instructor.The look on his face was equal parts maliciousness and delight and his gesticulations were as descriptive as they were crude.Toni peered at the source of Rays excitement and was forced to cover his mouth.The sergeant did seem to be a little too interested in Suelis neck and cleavage; the crotch of his pants had begun to bulge noticeably just below his paunch.Toni recovered quickly from his moment of mirth and returned his attention to the manual before him.It was a thick book, despite the very thin pages, and he found it strange that the sergeant had called it a paper support; its pages were tear resistant plastic.The manuals hard cover had MOCA TRI TRAINING SUIT INSTRUCTION MANUAL, EXTEC written over its front.The only thing Toni discovered before having to return his attention to Sergeant Abner was the meaning of the acronyms, printed on the inside page: MOtion CApture  Transmission/Reception Interface.The Moca Training Suit was the final product of the now defunct Experimental Technologies Bureau, before its privatization fifteen years ago, the sergeant continued.This weapons platform applied tried and tested physical motion capture and ocular motion capture technologies, and came with a state of the art software program we will be calling the OS, aka Operating System.With the development of the superior Hammerhead design, the Moca was relegated to trainer status six years ago.The Suit possesses many important systems, most of which will be studied in depth over the following fifty two days, particularly the Power Distribution Pyramid and its associated pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical systems.This theory will be complemented by practical lessons at the MEWACs Suit Installations, we call them the Stables around here.If you manage passing grades in both theoretical and practical studies, after a mid course interruption you will be qualified to drive the Moca in tactical exercises, and you will also commence training for the Hammerhead.Your first excursion to the stables begins today at fourteen hundred hours, so let us waste no more time and get into the material.Ah, excuse me, but your paper support manual is to be used for after hours study only, Cadet Templeton.Set it aside.As the sergeant began to instruct them on how to access the data stored in their pen keys, Toni turned his attention to the Special One.The cadets injuries had healed well, he saw, just as his own had.The more recent lashes that crisscrossed their backs, however, gave both cadets no option except to sit up straight; the wounds stung mercilessly from even indirect contact with the backs of their chairs.Ian had been unable to discourage Lieutenant Rose from filing disciplinary charges against him.His claim of having been assaulted by Toni first had only served to outrage the officer even further, and soon afterwards the SITs most senior recruit was being led away to MEWACs detention block.Tonis injuries had been serious enough to warrant a ride to Medical, where the orderlies spent the rest of the afternoon inspecting and treating his bumps and lacerations.After six oclock, a stiff faced Baylen had shown up to interrogate him in the company of a corporal Toni had occasionally seen alongside the bases Justice and Discipline Officer.Baylen had read out several questions from a notepad and jotted down summaries of the recruits answers, only to leave shortly afterwards with his silent sidekick in tow.Toni had replied honestly, mostly because he respected Baylen too much to lie to his face, but also because he wasnt altogether sure that embellishing his story would have benefitted him in any way.Baylen eventually told him that Ian was claiming the apprehended marker had been assigned to him, and that he had been forcefully retrieving the device after Toni had stolen it.Toni had objected fiercely, convinced that analysis of the markers data would prove that its owner had initiated the course in sixth place, not only due to the beginning time but also because the first three objectives had been reserved solely for him.Two days after that conversation, however, a sullen Baylen had informed him that the apprehended GPS marker was void of data.It had apparently been out of battery before the course had even begun.And youre actually telling me they werent checked first?You think Im going to believe that?!Im not an idiot, Baylen had barked back.Im not telling you to believe it, Im telling you theres no evidence to support your claim or his.Which means from now on itll be up to testimony, which means itll be up to who you know, your family name, blind luck or all of the above.Mason lifted the markers from depot without checking them first, thats his story.It might even be true, for all we know ...What about the other markers?Baylen had closed his eyes as if in pain.Every one of them worked fine.Except for the missing one, of course.That one hasnt been located yet ...At the disciplinary proceedings conclusion, Captain Damien had glowered at the recruits for a long minute before convicting them of conduct unbecoming and sentencing both to be lashed the following day.What all had hoped to see quickly resolved ended up being delayed for the better part of a week, until MEWAC Command finally confirmed the sentence and set the date of punishment for the 18th of April.At noon on that day Ian had withered under the maximum sentence of twenty lashes by the rod to his upper buttocks and lower back.Toni had received a more lenient ten.The weals were still fresh and tender, and Toni had since been having difficulty focusing on even the simplest of tasks; the pharmacopeia of nootropics no longer seemed capable of exerting the same effect on him as it had before Friday.He shook the thought out of his mind and tried to focus on the lesson.Sergeant Abner was already deep into his lesson and wading in deeper, and he kept pointing at a large inscribed triangle on the display screen that dominated the wall.At the triangles pinnacle he could read PRINCIPAL POWER UNIT (GAS TURBINE), and it was to that inscription that the sergeant pointed next.Well begin with the PPU which, aside from the fuel supply itself, is the greatest single contribution to the Suits chassis.The power unit is the beating heart of our Suits, and most operational parameters stem from its capabilities.There were several initial power plant proposals, but a gas turbine was ultimately chosen for having the most favorable power to weight ratio of any hydrocarbon fuel fed engine, as well as the lowest vibration, fewest moving parts and lowest lubricating oil consumption.The Mocas PPU burns almost any kerosene type or naphtha type gasoline, but diesel oil and biofuels can be used in a pinch.The power units main function as a compressor is to supply the adiabatic compressed air tank, aka ACAT, with highly compressed and dehumidified air.This air will then be used to engage the braided pneumatic artificial muscles, aka air muscles or PAMs, which will in turn move the Suit itself.The power unit also produces electricity to charge a lithium iron phosphate battery, aka LIP battery, which will power the OS, life support systems, instrumentation and hydraulic interface, as well as control actuation of the air muscles themselves.And so we get to the bottom of the power distribution pyramid where, as you can see on the bottom left corner, the PAMs will be consuming significant amounts of compressed air and electricity.This is necessary, of course.The air muscles require low compliancy to be able to carry heavy loads, and this implies moderately high pressure within the PAM sleeves.For that effect, air is decompressed from a maximum of five hundred Atmospheres down to ten or so, or about three times higher than ambient pressure at sea level.This gives us the 6.8 bar of overpressure which will provide lifting and moving power for a chassis with a loaded weight of over three tons.Do you have a question, Mr.Miura?the old sergeant asked in irritation.Well, sir, on my fathers farm we have an air compressor.Every time he got it working, the engine made so much noise wed have to keep clear of the shed.I was wondering, sir, just how noisy is the Suit?The sergeant clapped his hands together with glee and Toni realized that he was about to be stepped on.Well, as our friendly farmhand here tells us, compressors sure make a helluva lot of noise, dont they?he drawled, deliberately exaggerating Tonis rural accent to the amusement of his classmates.Sir, sir, I think Cassel has a question too!Ray suddenly said.The statement caught Toni by surprise; he hadnt noticed any raised hands from her side of the room.If anything, Sueli seemed even more surprised than he was.Abner, on the other hand, appeared positively delighted by the news.She gave Ray an ugly look; the Leibenese grinned widely back as the sergeant marched purposefully towards her.The noise level in the classroom soon began to climb.Gordie made it clear to his groaning neighbors that, besides being hungry, he was in the imminence of passing some gas.Grimm and Yamato pored over the manual, trading technical observations unconcernedly as Hannah traded observations of a very different kind with Rakaia.Ian consulted the manual in absolute silence, making occasional notes as he leafed through the pages.By the time the sergeant had thoroughly answered Suelis improvised questions and returned to Toni, he no longer had that malicious look on his face.Ray grinned at Toni and gave him a confident thumbs up.All right, Mr.Miura, Ill answer your question now.The Mocas PPU is quite noisy when its working; noisy enough, in fact, to compromise some tactical actions.As a result, the designer was forced to find a solution.The Suits ACAT can store four cubic meters of highly compressed air.That is enough to provide near silent locomotion for over ten minutes before the PPU needs to be reactivated.The ACAT is part of a closed system, meaning the high pressure tank is fitted within a low pressure tank that receives spent air from the PAMs for recycling.The ACAT then taps air directly from the low pressure tank, you see?This does away with the tell tale hissing sound inherent to pneumatic systems, not to mention that theres no need for the compressor to dehumidify the air since its already devoid of moisture.There is one last advantage to this layout: for a direct hit on the ACAT to succeed, the projectile would need to penetrate not only the exterior armor, but also the low pressure tank before confronting the HP tank within.But wont damaging the outer tank just leave the Suit inoperable anyway, sir?No, son, it wont.What it means is that spent air will then bleed out noisily from the system, not to mention that the PPU will take nearly twice as long to charge the ACAT due to the added need to dehumidify air.So your Suits combat radius is effectively halved after such a hit.Understood?There was a general affirmative.Sergeant Abner then promptly returned to his lesson and the morning began to drag along at an alarmingly slow rate.*****      The shuttle braved the heavy winds, the cadets inside clamoring joyfully whenever a more powerful gust came close to toppling it over.The road that linked their base to the MEWAC Suit Installations was embedded six meters below its surroundings, but the frequent curves sabotaged the measure, meant to avoid crosswinds, creating powerful eddies which occasionally challenged the driver.As Toni and his mates cheered in favor of the wind, others shouted words of encouragement to the uneasy driver, his knuckles bone white as they gripped the steering wheel.The MEWAC Suit Installations loomed into full view, but Baylen was still forced to point it out to the platoon once he had managed to shut them up.The structure they approached looked like nothing other than a particularly steep hill.The elevation peaked sixty meters above the surrounding forest floor but Baylen explained that that was merely for show; observed from within the duralumin bracing reinforced eggshell that enclosed them, the Stables rose no higher than thirty meters.The bracing structures exterior was comprised of faux rocky outcroppings and grassy extensions, and there were even a few small trees growing intermittently upon it.It was only when clued in to the deception that one noticed the illusion wasnt quite perfect.The trees were stunted in comparison to those that surrounded the Stables, and the artificial cave entrance at its base was a little too regular to ever be confused with a real one.Their transport entered the cave at a slow crawl, having only moments before been stopped at a checkpoint by a complement of RRU personnel.Toni had never seen commandos in the flesh before.They all wore soot black uniforms, smart red caps and cold, cold, sleepy eyes.A residue of wind, still strong and chilly, had buffeted their heavy cloaks.They had appeared wholly unimpressed by the collection of cheerful cadets.As soon as the transport came rolling to a stop, Baylen began to bark orders.Forming the platoon into a double column beside the shuttle, the corporal marched them through the overhang and into the cave, and then along the wide tunnel that stretched out beyond it.The tunnel soon opened out into a colossal cavern supported by a vast tangle of girders and struts, from where spotlights shone upon the main entryway to a monolithic wooden building.Toni stood awestruck before what he suddenly knew to be the oldest surviving construction on Capicua.He had seen images of the facade in his History classes; the Adamastors crew had had no choice except to over engineer their first structures on account of the Greats Winds.The History book, however, had not deigned to inform its readers of the buildings present purpose.Baylen set off and they entered the Warehouse Districts former administrative building with a silence usually reserved for a house of worship.The buildings exterior wall was so thick that crossing the doorways threshold gave the impression of entering another tunnel, one barely wide enough for two men to pass abreast without their shoulders brushing.Everything appeared to be made of redwood and, despite the countless deep scratches that marred all surfaces, shone as if the wood had been polished.Toni was surprised to find a large number of personnel at work inside.Moving quietly along the principal corridor, the cadets craned their necks to their sides, peering into office after office packed with soldiers and civilians.The impression Toni was left with as they exited the building through the other side was that there were still places in the CDF where people worked for a living.They finally came face to face with the stables themselves, over which the colossal canopy arched and extended out towards the caverns opposite end.Each almost as massive as the building they had just left behind, the six stables had inward facing entrances, three to each side, with an extensive concrete avenue running along between them.Over the avenue he spotted a sturdy overhead rail system suspended from flanking steel columns.From the main line, a secondary branched away towards each stable, effectively interconnecting them.You can close your mouths now, Sergeant cadets, Baylen drawled.Now that youve all seen what youve gotten yourselves into, we can make our way over to Stable Three.They set off again.As the group neared the buildings, the corporal began to explain the setup.Stables One and Two to your left and right, respectively, house the two ASC platoons, one for each.Stable Three houses the Training Suits and is allocated to the SIC only in practice, since formally its under the ASC as the Operational Training Section.Stable Four houses the simulators and is an extension of the OTS I just referred to.Stables Five and Six house the Repair and Maintenance Section, also under the ASC.They passed the first two stables, observing with apprehension as a very solid looking piece of hardware sailed over their heads and in through the entrance to Stable One.Beyond it, both side walls were almost entirely covered in dense scaffolding, with intermittent gaps about four meters wide and twelve high along their lengths.The titans lodged within were almost entirely obscured by their service gantries.He managed only to glimpse an enormous rotary rifle resting on a forklift and surrounded by technicians before the stables exterior wall blocked them from view.The platoon approached Stable Three and crossed the entrances threshold at a brisk pace.As with the previous compartment, it possessed a scaffolding structure along its side walls, beginning about a third of the way down and stretching out towards the opposite end about a hundred meters off.The space between the entrance and the scaffold appeared to be a sort of mustering ground for armored Suits, and the concrete floor was painted with faded squares to indicate each units position in formation.The intervals in the scaffolding structure appeared to be smaller and a few technicians in blue overalls loitered where the first of them could be found.The cadets footsteps echoed in the great room as they closed the distance towards them.Heiya, guys.Im looking for Ruka, she around?Stall Three, Corp, the most senior of them replied as Baylens hand was briefly shaken by the huddle.Yeah, sarge is checking the units access points, another volunteered.As Baylen was about to thank the civilians, an approaching figure motivated them to stand stiffly at attention.Baylen himself stiffened and fired off the smartest salute Toni had ever seen him give.The passing master sergeant ignored the civilians and reserved only a slight nod for Baylen before forging a path through the group.The sergeant wore no head covering and his shaven skull was pock marked with old scars and burn marks.His pitted face held a tight but emotionless expression, and the last thing Toni noticed as the sergeant passed within arms length of him was the Hitlerian moustache that decorated his upper lip, its whiskers abundantly streaked with grey.The master sergeant left the stable and the aura of menace left with him, and it was only as Toni observed the diminishing figure that he noticed how short the man was.He would never have realized that from the way he carried himself.Master sergeant Devonport ...the corporal explained as if the name alone explained everything, and then they were off once more.As the group passed by what Toni understood to be an empty Stall One, he noticed the titans in the opposite stalls and realized that they were significantly smaller than the Hammerhead.In their present configuration, however, the Mocas looked far more menacing.The training Suits proportions were much more similar to the humans who piloted them, their helms too, than the operational units.But more importantly, the Suits were almost entirely stripped of armor, exposing their glistening pneumatic air muscles to the world.The muscles gave the Suits the volume and appearance of a bodybuilder on a zero fat diet, which, combined with the occasional jagged protrusions that jutted out from their mostly hidden endoskeletons, made for a very intimidating sight indeed.Each titan stood like a marble statue within its stall, partially obscured by its service gantry, standing watch as the cadets neared one of their brethren.Toni felt someone elbow him.Rays eyes were wild with barely suppressed excitement, and he was pointing to his forearm where, to Tonis lack of surprise, goose bumps had erupted.He was unsurprised because his hairs were standing on end too.Afternoon, Sergeant.How are you today?Toni heard Baylen say.He turned, curious as to what had motivated the corporal to use his seductive voice.Sergeant Ruka stood high upon the gantry, clad in a red overall that couldnt quite hide her abundant curves.She wore her black cap with an upward tilt, the expressive eyes beneath it gazing down as she assessed the group.She put on a smile and answered back at him.Why, very well, Corporal.And how is Ms.Reeves doing?Baylen chuckled.Shes very well too, Sarge.I got fourteen cadets down here in desperate need of your wisdom.Can you take the time?The sergeant pursed her lips.I was under the impression there were sixteen of them ...Recruit Debusey took the Walk over a month ago with some psych problems.Recruit Marcus walked last week due to another unpleasant matter.Seems he was caught smuggling forty kilo mass of preserved meat from the canteen.Captain didnt like that too much.Well, the boy sure liked his bacon.All right then, just give me a mike.Ruka disappeared through the gantrys access point and they heard the rattle of feet against metal before she ducked out of a low doorway at the scaffolds base.All right, form them up, Ruka said.Form up!Baylen bellowed.Within a few brief seconds, all cadets were standing smartly at attention in a formation three lines deep.As their new instructor appraised the cadets, Toni found himself doing some appraising of his own.It would be the first time he was instructed by a woman, and the idea was somehow leaving him uneasy.She was older than she looked from afar, and fine lines creased the pale skin around her mouth, eyes and brow.Her hair was not dyed and numerous long grey strands streaked down amidst the thick ginger locks; she had tied those locks into an untidy ponytail with what he suspected was copper wire.But all that did not detract from the fact that a handsome woman stood before them.Toni then noticed Baylen observing him with a knowing smile on his lips.Hastily he turned his eyes front.Clearly unmindful of the scrutiny she had just been subjected to, the sergeant began to speak.I am Second sergeant Ruka Bellamy and I work in the ASCs Repair and Maintenance Section.I am responsible for prepping the Moca Suits for excursions and inspecting them on their return for any damage.Today I will give you a chance to get up close and personal with a real Suit, but first Im laying a few simple rules down on the table: keep together at all times, dont touch anything without permission, dont interrupt me, and if you have a question, wait till I allow you to ask it.Understood?As soon as she was satisfied that all had understood the rules, Baylen dismissed the formation and the cadets were soon huddling beside Unit Threes right footpad.Id like you all to take a good look around.This is Stall Three and it exists to help the maintenance personnel gain access to the hardware.From these platforms we can detect fractures in some components of the endoskeleton, repair or replace ruptured PAMs situated above waist line height, maintain the PPU, just about anything that doesnt require removal of the unit from its stall.But sometimes its just not possible to do this.If you look above your heads, youll see that the Automated Transport Bus, or ATB, is able to access each stall in this stable.In fact, it can access any unit in any stable when needed, remove whichever Suit its ordered to remove and convey it to Stable Five, where we have more specialized apparatus to deal with the problem at hand.With that equipment, we can strip a Suit down to its modules in less than half an hour.Thats one of the more interesting facts about the Moca Suit; its highly modular in nature.There are six hundred and thirty nine skeletal muscles in the human body, but only eight different types of PAMs are needed to reproduce with a Suit almost every movement a human being can perform.These PAMs are distinguishable by their lengths, widths and compliancy rating.For example, the lowest compliancy rating PAMs can be found in the lower appendages, she patted the titans massive calf muscle beside her for effect, while the highest compliancy PAMs can be found in the upper body and appendages.There are two reasons for this: the air muscles with highest compliancy have the thinnest walls, and so one saves weight where it counts the most, up above.And this way the Suits muscular structure mimics its human counterpart and gives its hydraulic interface a much easier time feeding impulses back and forth.This takes us to the HINT itself.Follow me.She set off towards the scaffolds stairway at a brisk pace and the cadets scrambled to catch up to her.After climbing three flights of stairs, she exited onto the platform that allowed access to the Suits thorax.Before the cadets had managed to set their feet on the structure, Ruka shooed them back and slid an extension plate forwards along the flooring, gaining access to its right breast.She paused for a moment as the cadets crowded onto the cramped gantry, her hand resting lightly on the glistening muscles that covered the breastplate like pythons.Toni and Ray traded mischievous grins with one another before Balyens scowl cowed them into submission.Take a good look at Unit Threes right pectoral muscle.Its comprised of fourteen A3 type PAMs.Anyone care to tell me why its so important to have fourteen air muscles instead of just one?Because a direct hit would only damage a few of them, leaving the machine still operable, Hirum volunteered.That is correct, though calling the Moca Suit a machine is a little like calling your mother an incubator.It is either Suit or Unit, Ill accept nothing else.Understood?Each of the fourteen PAMs connects to a detachable interior half breastplate.That breastplate is detachable for a reason.Watch closely ...Ruka pointed to the wide metal ridge that separated the half breastplates.She then traced her hand up over it before coming to a stop above a small orifice where a human collarbone would normally be.Taking out a large metal turnkey, she inserted it into the orifice and twisted it counter clockwise.Nothing happened.Oh, for fucks sake!Ruka cursed, and she began to slam her knee against the PAMs.On her fourth attempt, the right breastplate suddenly moved, opening out like a clam shell to the whine of hydraulics to expose its dark interior.Hatch is a bit twitchy.And the lightings out, she explained before quickly producing a penlight and illuminating the interior.There was something medieval about the contraption suspended in there, humanoid in form but crawling with countless color coded wires that hugged the structure tightly.Its head was missing.A heavy looking helmet hovered before the hydraulic interface, hanging loosely from the compartments ceiling from thick spiraling cables.The interface itself stood suspended by a thick robotic arm fixed to the ceiling, giving the impression that the HINT had been impaled upon a gigantic articulated meat hook.The compartments walls crawled with more wiring, some of it feeding into the hydraulic system that apparently moved the Suits breastplates.The sight of it all made Toni feel a sudden urge to strap himself in, to enter the techno womb and become a titan himself.Others did not seem to share his enthusiasm.Horrible!It has barely more space than a coffin.And whats with all the wires?he heard Sueli say, her pretty nose crinkled as she stared with horrified fascination.The sergeants answering smile was not entirely genuine.There are two types of wiring in the interior.The red black wiring is electrical and feeds the HINT, hatch mechanism and HUD Helmet.The Blue yellow type is actually hydraulic tubing, which again feeds the HINT and hatch mechanism.The Moca doesnt have as much interior space as our more recent model, nor is its cavity as tidy as theirs.But dont forget that it was a pioneer model, and so this probably couldnt be helped.On the up side, the Moca weighs less than four tons fully loaded compared to the Hammerheads eight and has almost twice the autonomy and less than half the fuel consumption.Respect the Moca, or Ill lose respect for you.On the down side, there is a flaw inherent to the cavitys reduced volume.Some heavy impacts against the Suit, like when it takes a fall, will result in the driver making physical contact with the cavity walls.Due to this weve been outfitting the cavities with protective padding, which we expect will protect the tubing and wiring against damage from the HINT, as well as to provide some protection for the driver himself.In any case, a Moca driver may, with some impacts at least, feel two collisions for every one that actually happens.This is what we call double slamming   Sergeant Rukas explanation was cut short by a blaring alarm.The grating sound filled the cavernous compartment, causing echoes to rebound from the opposite side and add to the cacophony.Only then did Toni notice that loudspeakers had been fixed to the ceiling above every second stall.There was one just above his head, which probably explained why his ears were beginning to hurt.Rukas face began to pale.Pulling Baylen by the collar until his ear was beside her mouth, the sergeant shouted urgently into it.Toni was unable to make out what she was saying, but he didnt really need to; by her gestures alone, she was ordering him to get the cadets out of there in a hurry.The corporal quickly obliged.SINGLE COLUMN!Baylen bellowed as he displayed an index finger above his head and, without waiting for anyone to react, the corporal began to descend the scaffold stairway at a run.Toni was among the first to follow his instructor.As Baylen left the stairs for the stables ground floor, someone collided violently against him and both fell, setting off a traffic jam among the platoon members still within the scaffolding structure.Toni fell over the struggling pair and rolled over the floor instinctively as he was ejected through the doorway.Toni saw several blue clad civilians running towards the other stalls, surprise and puzzlement stamped on their faces.Turning around, he found that the man who had caused the collision was one of those technicians.The civilian was splayed out on the floor, held in a headlock by a very livid corporal.He hurried to intervene.Corporal, sir.Baylen, youre gonna kill him, dammit.Hes a civilian!Toni shouted as he and others tried unsuccessfully to loosen his superiors hold on the man.The technicians face was fast becoming as blue as his uniform.The corporal suddenly released him and, after shouting a few expletives into the dazed mans ear, stood and stepped away from the doorway, holding a pair of fingers above his head in a V sign.The platoon poured out of the scaffold and formed a double column while on the platform above their heads an exasperated Ruka shouted for her missing assistant.The platoon then set off at a run and quickly exited Stable Three, finding the first two stables in an even greater state of confusion as they passed them by.Open columns!Baylen shouted as they neared the exit.The platoon hurried to comply.A second group, also formed up in a double column, raced through the doorway at a sprint and passed between them.Toni watched the soldiers as they sped by, mostly men with short haircuts and hard faces, but some women were among them too.One femme was still clothing herself in a driving suit as she ran, her muscular arm straining as she pushed the other through its elastic sleeve.A few short seconds later they were gone, and Toni only realized that they were the ASCs sergeants at arms once his platoon was already abandoning the warehouse district.EIGHT      Leiben, 14H49, 21th of April, 2771      It being the twenty first day of the month, many in Leiben were surprised with the cloudless sky upon waking that morning.Despite first appearances, however, over the course of the day cycle the city was wracked by powerful gusts of wind, the squat, aerodynamic buildings that dominated the capital channeling those gusts into its streets and alleys, effectively turning them into wind tunnels.By early afternoon, most commuting was being conducted via the metro system and subterranean walkways that interconnected the buildings, and as a result very few citizens were topside when the solar flare alarm began to sound.The few up top who did hear the intermittent blare found it all quite odd, not so much due to such flares being a rare occurrence, but because of the peculiar manner in which it all happened.There was a sudden, intense flash from the sky above, and all those who happened to be looking up were momentarily blinded, feeling sudden warmth on their faces they hadnt known over the last few days.Many kept their eyes to the sky a moment longer, finding it strange that the quickly dissipating flash had originated separately from the red sun further south, a few of them wondering whether it was some strange atmospheric phenomenon due to solar wind striking the upper atmosphere.Even those citizens, however, soon found themselves bounding towards the nearest building or underground access point as the alarms urgent blare began to make itself heard.No one wanted to be caught topside once the flares full force hit the planet.The alarm had choked momentarily before singing out with all its might, something else those who had heard it before didnt remember having ever happened.By the end of the first minute after the events onset, every window in the city had been shuttered and every citizen evacuated to a safer place, all except for the ATS users.Almost every transport vehicle of the Automated Transit System inexplicably sputtered to a complete stop, their panicked passengers being forced to use the manual overrides to exit their allotted cars, some even having to shatter the side windows with little glass breaking hammers.The few hundred ATS commuters scurried towards the nearest refuges, the unforgiving wind buffeting them violently as they hurried along like drunks in a footrace, some glancing to the sky with barely suppressed panic while others laughed at the unexpected adventure.By that time, almost every alarm system crammed inside a cramped room within the Anti Air Threat Artillery Command Center had been muted, their overwhelmed operators struggling to take stock of the situation.*****      Donovan Gaeta had been an AATACC Second Lieutenant for more than two years, and the small, comfortable, air conditioned Detection and Response Room was slowly becoming a second home to him.One year short of the thirty five year promotion barrier, Don had finally been evaluated as officer material, his electronic warfare background having weighed heavily in favor of the decision.The promotions details didnt matter, however.What mattered to him was the net effect it would have on his life.His current employment was in a home appliance repair shop, and the extra pay from his part time commitment to the forces, along with his recent promotion, were allowing him to entertain possibilities that only a few years ago he wouldnt have dreamed possible.Lisa had recently begun to hint that they should once again request endorsement for procreation.It was time for offspring number three, perhaps, she had whispered to him more than once.Don had decided that morning to discuss the possibility with the lieutenant who warmed the seat beside his.First lieutenant Mara Springer had more than twenty years of service and four childbirths under her considerable belt.She possessed a healthy dose of lucidity, a larger dose of humor, and happened to enjoy dispensing advice when encouraged to do so.After the usual morning formalities, their conversation had focused mainly on the weather and other such futilities, until he had finally broached the subject of family planning.Mara had found interest in the subject matter, and they had spoken all morning about licenses, parental financing and his wifes current state of health.By mornings end, as they enjoyed the best grub an Army with a tight budget could afford, he had quietly decided to become a father again.Everything of relevance having been said, the afternoon began to drag along more slowly, the operators trading point position with one another so Don could get some drill time on the principal console.The AATACCs DRR was Capicuas primary instrument for the detection and elimination of air and spaceborne threats against its capital.Mostly that implied the detection and tracking of Apollo type asteroids or similar bodies by way of the Active Electronically Scanned Array, an old world Radar system scavenged from the Adamastor, the system being complimented by an ultra high gain antenna array of similar origin for threat pinpointing and ID.The AESA was an old workhorse and had been upgraded several times, but as yet no replacement program had been developed out of the sheer expense such an endeavor would entail.In fact, the only recent addition to the collection of detection instruments was the Plasma InfraRed Emission Detector, a relatively recent investment that, duly coupled with the Disposable Laser Cartridge Artillery System, was expected to intercept any inbound hyper velocity target over the citys upper atmosphere.The PIRED and DLCAS were the brainchildren of those who had been particularly shaken up by the long past phantom battle, and both systems were currently an integral part of Leibens continuing bid to be the sole power on Capicua.A warning blip suddenly made itself heard, the response rooms mellow lighting correspondingly morphing into red.Surprised at the unexpected exercise, Don sat a little straighter, flicking his eyes towards Mara; she appeared bored and a little irritated by the interruption to her private thoughts.Threat identified!Don said, a little louder than was really necessary.Mara annoyance intensified.She was once again sitting in the primarys seat and he had just spoken her line.Threat identified!Mara barked, staring at her second with an expectant quirk in her brow.Feeling foolish, Don quickly slid up his display screen and assessed the incoming data.Threat inbound from LCO, heading towards the equator at 62 degrees latitudinal inclination.Velocity barely sub orbital, vertical component almost nil, with an altitude a smidge over one hundred clicks.No threat of impact with Leiben or any other manmade infrastructure, he summed up.Sub orbital ...Mara whispered.More loudly, she addressed her second.No intervention necessary.Inform the artillery batteries to standby but to not, I repeat, to not fire against threat.As Don hurried to comply, Mara took a closer look at her own screens display, the only one between them that provided a visual representation of what was taking place; the three dimensional image before her eyes displayed the curve of a planetary surface and, high up and moving in a lazy arc just north of Leibens outskirts, a small yellow blip surrounded by a triangle.Whats its cross section?she asked.Its tiny.Must be a meteor, probably no more than a few kilos.No meteor would be moving at sub orbital speeds.This is man made, Don.Were looking at a man made something coming out of orbit.Or maybe this is just an exercise.A debate broke out between them as to whether they were at the moment party to a simulation, and indeed Mara was beginning to suspect that that was the case.All orbiting objects more than five centimeters across had already been detected and their orbits characterized.All fifty five of them.And there was no indication that any would be returning to Capicua in the near future.Just as Mara was thinking that, however, the yellow blip vanished.Several things suddenly happened at once.Every single alarm system inside the room simultaneously elected to bleat, blare, and otherwise buffet the operators with an overwhelming cacophony of sound.In the same moment their display screens caved in, and Mara suddenly found herself staring at a transparent glassy pane and, through it, at myriad flashing lights fixed against the wall, warning her that something was terribly wrong.What did we do?Don asked, holding his hands away from his console as if suspecting he had pressed a wrong button.Nothing.Restart your computer.Pressing the rapid boot button on the wall, she began to pray as she waited for a response.An impossibly long second later, their display screens came to life again, and Maras relief was quickly overruled by fear for what she might find once all systems were running.Working fast, she digited her pass code when the prompt appeared, barking at her second to hurry and do the same.Before assessing the visrep on her screen, she pressed the Call to Quarters alarm button and, quickly pulling the C to Q pass code tag out from the crevice of her substantial bosom, she broke it and read the eight digit alphanumeric code concealed inside.Quickly digiting the code into the appropriate prompt, she entered, and a brand new hooting alarm began to make itself heard somewhere beyond the response room.Hollering at her second to evaluate and deactivate the remaining alarms, she finally opened the visrep on the screen before her.What she saw there nearly stopped her heart.Several dozen blips populated the entire lower thermosphere above Leiben, and were belting down fast over the capital of her world.Were under attack, she stated breathlessly.What do you mean, under attack?You just said it was an exercise, he countered.Not saying a word, she turned her display screen towards him.The expression on his face made it clear that he was seeing her point.She hurried to make a decision.These are way too many targets to leave to human intervention.Im removing execution authority from the ArtBats and handing it to the MAGE.Do you agree?she asked, her chest heaving.Seventy three  no, seventy five ballistic targets inbound at over five clicks per sec.Yeah, I agree, he replied, and then they simultaneously did the same thing.Removing pen keys from their pockets, they inserted the devices into their respective slots on the consoles before them.All visual displays promptly disappeared, only to be replaced by a series of command options.Working quickly, they progressed through each option.The last one was for Mara alone.She opted to engage the MAGE.A corded telephone suddenly chimed beside Mara, startling her.The phone rang once more before the lieutenant managed to unfreeze herself and answer it.Say, what the hell is going on over there, people?an outraged voice shouted from some obscure office in the Strategic Command Center.It was Lieutenant Colonel Timmons, the centers most highly decorated asshole.But Mara couldnt let him be one today.Colonel, sir, we were moments ago tracking a single space borne threat as it passed over Leiben.It then detonated and almost knocked out our defensive capability.Since getting our systems back online weve been tracking seventy five targets closing in on Leiben at over five clicks per second.I initiated the Call to Quarters alarm and passed execution authority to the MAGE   You did WHAT?her superior screamed from on other side.She winced at his sudden rage and wondered for the first time whether she had done the right thing.The colonel began to laugh.Well then, Lieutenant, we seemed to have jumped the gun a little here.You may not have realized it all cooked up in there, but the solar flare alarm has sounded over the city, compliments of our Flare Early Warning System.What youre seeing is a clear sign of interference from the higher atmosphere due to unusual solar activity.We are not, nor have we any reason to suspect we are about to be, under attack.Now just relax and keep your hands off the console so I can overrule that decision of yours.NO!she shouted before she could stop herself.The complete silence on the line was disheartening.Apologies, sir, but that decision cant be made without authorization of the SCC commander himself, she reasoned, thinking hard as she mentally reassessed what she had witnessed over the last minute.Sweetie, I know you think youre very smart, but if I inform the Colonel you engaged the MAGE under these circumstances, you will be court martialed.Am I clear?Yessir, I understand that, but if youre wrong and Im right, in a minute or two well all be dead.Please listen, sir.If the signals were receiving were radar phantoms, and my seconds telling me were up to eighty three now, their trajectories would be erratic.Not ballistic!And certainly not nearly parallel to one another.My conclusion is that this is either an exercise or a legitimate strike.Ill stake my career on it, sir!There was a long pause as her superior pondered on her words.Well, sunshine, youre in luck today, cause Im not in a mood to stake your career on this notion of yours.I am removing execution authority from MAGE and handing it to the ArtBats.Where it belongs.Have a nice day, dear.The line went dead, leaving a very distraught Lieutenant to stare at her screen as a cascade of inbounds rained down over her beloved city.*****      The moment after Lieutenant Mara engaged the MAGE, the Master Gigabit Ethernet system was flooded with several terabytes of data that had accumulated in the response rooms databanks since the first bogeys appearance.It took all of ten seconds for the silicone germanium processors to upload and process the information, and to reach a decision.Accessing the General Military Network, it ploughed through all firewalls and hooked itself up to the six Artillery Batteries that belted the capital, as well as to the three primary instruments with which it intended to perceive its foe.Accessing the Active Electronically Scanned Array, Plasma InfraRed Emission Display and High Gain Antenna array directly, it dispensed with the response rooms torrent of data, preferring the much more direct influx those systems could provide.The master system duly noted that the inbound targets did not appear on the scanned array and presumed that it was due to stealth technology on the Threats part.In fact, the signals only showed up on the PIRED because their inbound trajectories through the lower thermosphere were leaving an infrared emitting path in their wakes.The system calculated the probability of interception at the nearest targets altitude, which at that very moment was just inside the mesosphere.Dissatisfied with the results, it decided to wait, and instead prepared the Disposable Laser Cartridge Artillery System for firing operations.Surrounding Leiben like somber sentinels, the Anti Air Threat Artillery Batteries stood potently, each with three cannon pointed out towards a non existent enemy on the horizon.Upon receiving orders, only four of the batteries activated; the remaining two were under maintenance, vital hardware components having been removed for repair.The artillery system, better known as DLCAS, had been the subject of a fifteen year research program before finally being fielded, and centered on an entirely new way to fire cannon.Designed around its munitions, each unit possessed a ludicrous combined reinforced/perforated chamber, which once activated opened to allow a two meter long, 200 millimeter shell to be inserted.The cannon then resealed their breeches and traversed their snubbed barrels up towards the sky.Once there, the cannons instrumentation extracted specific data from the shells to assist in calibration, and then paused for further instructions.Momentarily foiled in its intention to strike down the incoming targets, the master system relied instead on the High Gain Antennas for targeting.By themselves, the HGAs were nearly useless, possessing such a narrow field of vision as to render them incapable of detecting the incoming objects.Combined with the PIRED, however, the HGAs would be able to pinpoint each targets real time location precisely enough for it to be engaged.There was a rub to contend with, however.What allowed the PIRED to detect the objects at all was the infrared signature they produced as they tore through the thermosphere, compressing the already hot gases there to a point where IR emissions could be detected.But with such a steep descending angle, with such a powerful IR signature compared to its size, and at an altitude of over a hundred kilometers, the targets frustrated PIREDs attempts to supply the artillery system with the precise data necessary for interception.Added to that was another complication.The high gain antennae were unable to penetrate the ever intensifying plasma surrounding the objects, meaning these would have to descend until they were low and slow enough for the shroud to dissipate.The system calculated that, at the current rate of the targets deceleration, the altitude of engagement would be thirty five kilometers.And so it waited another twenty seconds, tasking several HGA components in pairs to each battery in advance.As the nearest targets punched through the thirty five kilometer mark at over three kilometers per second, the ionization dissipated enough for the high gain antennae to precisely map their trajectories and the laser cannon system began to be fed real time data.Finally receiving the necessary vectors, each individual cannon acquired its respective target and began tracking operations.At 14H50, local time, Unit 2 of the 1st Anti air Threat Battery reached a firing solution and electrically initiated its shell.The shell cartridges rear section consisted of a cylindrical block of high explosives, encased within a copper cylinder and surrounded by a carefully spaced solenoid, the casing and solenoid forming an open circuit at their extremities via an instrument package.At rest, that circuit was devoid of current, but upon the shells electrical initiation, a capacitor bank, hidden safely within the Battery infrastructure, instantly pumped a powerful electrical charge into the solenoid, generating an intense magnetic field between itself and the casing for the briefest of moments.At the point of highest magnetic intensity, the electric detonator at the shells base fired, sending a detonation wave coursing through the Elastomer bonded Octogen main charge.Before five microseconds had passed, the expanding shock front reached the metal casing and began to deform it outwards into a funnel shape, distorting the magnetic field between itself and the solenoid until they contacted each other, and in doing so progressively short circuiting the circuit along the shells length as the wave front advanced.The detonation wave raced along the entirety of the explosive charge, the expanding plasma plasticizing its metal container, torturing it into a magnetic field distorting, electrically inducting tube, and so causing a significant fraction of the explosive charges stored chemical energy to be transformed into electrical current.By the time the explosive shock front had reached the end of its short journey, the inducting effect caused by the distorting magnetic field had intensified the current by two orders of magnitude.In that moment, a load switch placed in the fore instrument package did the first, last, and only thing it had been designed to do: it closed at maximum flux compression, transferring the generated current into the killing component of the shell, an optically pumped diode laser, specially designed for the sole purpose of producing an exceptionally intense, coherent infrared flash before frying itself.Over the following seconds, all operational cannon fired, sending twelve coherent near infrared flashes across the distance between the weapons and their targets, some managing to deposit over twenty kilojoules of thermal energy against the objects blackened exteriors in a microsecond.The PIRED detected six brief, very intense infrared flashes as targets disintegrated, the remaining six continuing their descent unhampered.By the time the sixth flash had been detected, the first cannon to fire had already reloaded and prepared to fire again.Ever more frequent flashes of light illuminated the countryside as the seconds passed by, each accompanied by the tremendous concussion of the DLC cannon as their perforated blast chambers noisily expelled super heated explosive residue before ejecting the remains of their shells.The incoming targets continued to slow down as they penetrated the lower atmosphere, their numbers dwindling quickly with each passing second until, only a moment before complete interception, the MAGE was abruptly pulled from the task, execution authority automatically transferring to the four stunned Battery commanders who had only just reached their stations.The remaining two inbounds struck their targets and detonated within a second of each another.The first warhead detonated beside the 3rd Anti air Threat Artillery Batterys center cannon, releasing a deadly burst of Gamma rays, x rays and a constellation of charged particles outwards into the immediate area.Twenty meters away from the heart of the blast, the steel reinforced concrete bunker proved thick enough to absorb most of the radiation.The lieutenant and his three man crew, having barely begun to take stock of what was happening, nevertheless received more than fifty gray of lethal emissions.Suffering an influx of more than three thousand joules of heat energy each, the four men suddenly felt an intense searing sensation course throughout their bodies.It was the last feeling they would ever experience.Thermal radiation emanating from the proto fireball simultaneously assaulted every surface it came into contact with, ablating steel and concrete away with enough intensity to toss cannon out into the incandescing trees like juggling clubs.The enormous pressure from the bunkers ablating roof drove it downwards towards the doomed soldiers until, a fraction of a second later, the expanding fireball collided against the concrete.In the briefest of instants, four young lives were snuffed out.The second warhead came down over the city itself, detonating ten meters above a residential complex in the May 23rd neighborhood.In an instant of fire and light, the building was driven into the ground, its solid construction no impediment to the forces acting upon it.Floor after floor collapsed, extinguishing the lives of men, women and children in a layer cake of tragedy until the collapsing mass broke through its arched foundations and pummeled into the underground transit system beneath.All commuters who had taken shelter there perished immediately, not even those who had been shouldered into the stations radiating tunnel complex being spared of such a fate; the falling debris acted like a pneumatic hammer, ejecting air from the stations cathedral like interior with enough force to propel anything not bolted down towards unyielding concrete and unforgiving steel.Two nearby buildings came crashing down with the blast, their ruins cutting off all access to the gaping hole in the earth where the center building had stood.All electronic devices in the immediate area were instantly destroyed and power spikes in the electricity distribution grid damaged all appliances in the city lacking the proper protection.Leiben Varsity was one of the more fortunate establishments, its electricity grid possessing many contingencies meant to protect its sensitive research equipment.In the Varsitys distinguished Department of Physics, in a dark room with blacked out windows situated on the complexs third floor, a computer connected to a collection of scientific instruments duly recorded the second warheads neutron spike.A nearby physicist, distracted by his calculations, raised his head in irritation at the computers warning bleep.His hackles then rose as an odd crackling sound began to emanate from the blackened windows beside him.His stretched his hand out hesitantly and splayed it upon the nearest windowpanes surface.It was warm to the touch and heating up quickly.Whatever thoughts were going through his mind then fled as the windows shattered with explosive force.Glass fragments and broken window frames flew into the compartment with an earsplitting concussion, carving up the young mans exposed skin and tossing him mercilessly onto the floor.He lay there for a long moment, his slowly recovering ears picking up the sound of glass shards tinkling off myriad chairs and worktables, listening in astonishment to the resounding rumble that was coming from a large, rectangular hole in the wall.Carefully but clumsily he rose, barely noticing the pain from the cut in the palm of his hand.A jagged piece of glass stuck out of the wound, having found its new refuge the moment he had pushed himself up off the floor.He approached the opening with awkward steps, the enormous explosion having somehow knocked all grace out of him, and then paused to contemplate the solitary black mushroom cloud that stooped over his city.He felt sick all of a sudden and wondered numbly whether it was from radiation sickness.He found that his right eye could no longer focus correctly, and was about to rub it when he became aware of his shredded hands.He stared down at them, horrified by the vision of carnage.Was that a piece of milky white glass, or was it a protruding bone?He tried to poke at the outcropping but quickly gave up when the pain intensified.Blood dripped freely into his palms and onto the patterned floor, and his right eye was entirely out of focus now, able to see the world outside only through smudged shades of red.His untidily scribbled notes lay forgotten on the floor.Only moments ago he had been working on an efficient new way to produce Polonium 208 from natural Bismuth.As much as he tried now, however, all he could focus on was what his only remaining eye could perceive  at the base of the rising mushroom cloud, an enormous billowing cumulous expanding up and outwards, blotting out the still erect buildings with a deep rumble.In a few moments that cloud would reach him.Hot tears joined the rivulets of blood streaming down his face.NINE      900 kilometers south east of Lograin, 09H30, 19th of May, 2771      The ScoutEagle MA 17 Reconnaissance Drone persisted at its set altitude of twelve thousand meters, the unmanned crafts systems retransmitting the acquired data along a string of relay drones that stretched to the north west like pearls on a necklace.Five such pearl strings advanced parallel along a south easterly course, the edges of their twenty kilometer wide target terrain overlapping so mission analysts could later compile a detailed map of the Mining Quadrant.The drone constituted the lead element of the center most pearl string, its directional tail antennae pointing back towards the nearest data relay drone more than a hundred kilometers away.The trailing elements only answer to the torrent of raw data came in the form of an occasional ping, allowing the lead know its antennas aim was true.Operation Widescan 3 differed from its predecessors in two important ways.The previous operations drones had merely made use of passive detection equipment, while the current leading drones were freshly equipped with active ground mapping radar.It was also the first mission tasked to cross the 45 radial line, beyond which several million hectares of exclusively plantation land was to be found.The Ground Mapping Radar system possessed one significant advantage and one compromising handicap over earlier sensors.Unlike its predecessors, which could only passively detect the UVB and long infra red components of the electromagnetic spectrum, the GMR produced a high gain radar beam in the microwave frequency that not only detected all surface structures, including those hidden beneath the more sophisticated camouflage nets, but also most subsurface excavations of military value.The beam streaked across the terrain over fifty times per second in ten meter wide swaths, the raw return signal being immediately redirected to Lograin Air Bases operational headquarters for analysis.The systems weak point, however, was that a sufficiently advanced passive radar system could possibly detect operating GMRs, the diffracting effect as its beam passed through certain airborne obstacles acting as a possible source of detection, not to mention the signal scattering effect that occurred whenever the beam came into contact with rockier soils.So far, the center lead drone had advanced unmolested, and apparently undetected, over the course of more than seven thousand kilometers, and was nearing the end of its outward leg, where it would, along with its flanking companions, execute a carefully choreographed about face and head for home.Shortly after it passed the seventy one hundred mark, however, the autonomous aircrafts fate was abruptly sealed.The drones forward ocular, existing only for flight navigation and obstacle avoidance, barely had time to register an abrupt change in the incident luminosity before the entire front portion of the craft disintegrated.As the leading crafts flaming remains initiated their plummeting journey back to earth, its two nearest brothers placidly maintained their heading.Had they been piloted aircraft, their pilots would have experienced an oh shit!moment and bugged out in time to give warning of the attack, with the additional bonus of preserving their lives and equipment.Instead both continued on their courses until, as if on cue, both were obliterated.Moments later, someone at Lograin Air Base suddenly stopped drinking his coffee and experienced his own personal oh shit!moment, and then he ordered the five pearl strings trailing elements to update their status and bug out.The most advanced trailing elements CPUs reclassified themselves as the new leading elements, transmitted the video data of their former leaders abrupt demise, and initiated a lazy turn for home.Three of them abruptly burst into flames.*****      The wall clock indicated that it was already quite late in the morning.Or at least late for the army, or for the farm, or for any other place where people might be expected to put in solid working hours.But it happened to be a Sunday, and it also happened to be the first day the SICs sole platoon had gotten off in over a month, and all were currently dedicating themselves to lying on their beds in slumber.The violent femmes were nowhere to be seen, and were probably dedicating their morning to similar pursuits in their own casern.The blackout boards had already been rudely pulled out of their fixtures from the high windows; yet another of Masons many fervent contributions to the platoons general mood.The bastard was a consummate morning person, and had apparently objected to his charges intention to remain indoors until lunchtime.No one had found the nerve to protest as he yanked the boards out, flooding the darkened compartment with painfully bright sunlight, everyone knowing all too well that the less they argued, the faster he would leave, and the faster some brave cadet might rise to the occasion and blanket the windows.Toni wasnt going to play the part.It wasnt that he was afraid of Mason.His body simply ached too much for the effort it required.
