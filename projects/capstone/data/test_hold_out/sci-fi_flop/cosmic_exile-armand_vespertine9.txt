he ordered.The four of them split up into two groups, each going the opposite way down the crimson corridor.Marc and Ilene scurried like rodents down the blood red hall.Ilene was listening intently for any signs of approaching Scraumudi, and Marc was constantly glancing down at his scanner.They had reached the hatch in a matter of seconds.It was a sphincter like opening roughly one meter across.How do we open it?Ilene whispered as softly as she could.She grimaced as Marc cautiously reached out and lightly touched the grotesque portcullis.The revolting thing opened with a sickening noise, spewing out a vile smell.They both covered their mouths and tried to suppress their gagging.They jumped with a start when they heard the scanner beeping softly.Scraumudi were coming their way.Go, go!Marc whispered.Ilene leapt through the hole and Marc followed quickly, with the door snapping shut just as he was through.They sat up against the inside wall, waiting for the Scraumudi to pass.Ilene looked as if she was about to vomit, so Marc slapped his hand over her mouth.The Serpents stampeded towards Drkp as quickly as their many legs could carry them, oblivious to the escaped Humans hiding just inside the wall.When they had passed Marc let go of Ilene, and she immediately began vomiting.He held back her greasy hair as she was on her hands and knees.For a moment he was alarmed by the blood red colour of her vomit, but realized it was only from the Scraumudi algae.When she had finished she took a moment to observe her surroundings.The crawlspace was dimly lit, and much narrower than the main passage.Only one person could walk abreast inside.It was also much taller, perhaps several decks high.It was lined with veins and arteries of varying sizes, conveying all sorts of fluids to and fro.Ilene realized that the dim light was coming from the thick nerve strands.Bioluminescent pulses were rapidly being sent back and forth along them.The smell was still awful, but now her stomach was entirely empty, and she had nothing left to throw up.Its kind of like on those kids shows, where they shrink down and go inside a persons body, she commented.Blades, are you okay?Marc asked concerned.Yeah, Im fine, she replied.Lets just get going.She struggled to her feet, and then took a deep breath.Just breathe through your mouth.Breath through your mouth, she told herself.Okay.Ill take point.Come on.She began to scurry down the foreboding, narrow passage, and Marc followed close behind.Both were careful to make as little noise as possible, and not to touch any of the bizarre extrusions in the walls.The air was thick in the crawlspace, and the stench was palpable.To Ilene it felt as if the atmosphere was pulsing with the light, and each time it did, it was pounding inside of her head.Each breath was sickening, and she became weak and dizzy.She was surrounded by gushings and drippings and noises more bizarre.Noises like a stomach makes, only heard from the inside.She lost her footing, and stumbled to the soft and spongy ground.Blades!Marc cried softly, bending down to pick her up.Are you sure youre okay?I dont know.Its just, this place.Its making me sick, she told her.But you seem all right, so it must all be in my head.Its psychological.I can deal with it.I can get over it.I just need to imagine Im somewhere else.Problem is I have a terrible imagination.Blades, you can rest for a minute if you need to, Marc said.No I cant!The longer we take to do this, the more likely well be caught.Then well all die, Ilene reminded them both.She pulled herself to her feet.My family is not going to die because I couldnt take a little biogenic reek!Im stronger than that!Lets keep going.In spite of how horrible she felt, Ilene continued plodding through the crawlspace with Marc on her heals.Soon they came to the first junction, a roughly circular room connecting with two other passages.There was also a diagonal shaft between them.Helena said the one on the right didnt she?Ilene whispered.Marc nodded.They turned towards it, but halted immediately when something came out of the shaft.They were seized with terror when they first glimpsed it, fearing it was a Scraumudi, but it was actually something quite different.It looked like a spider, a foot or so long, with a smooth white carapace.It had six long limbs, seemingly joint less as though they were slender tentacles.At the end of each limb were five wispy, retractable tendrils.It had relatively large pair of bright blue eyes with two thin proboscises between them.When it saw them it came to a stop as well, and simply stared at them curiously.Dont move, Marc whispered.What is it?Ilene asked.I dont know, Marc said.Do you think maybe its a pet of some kind?she asked.I dont know, Marc repeated.I doubt it though.Drkp said that algae was the only other thing that lived on their ring world.I think maybe its a part of the ship.Marc was right.It was in fact a biot: a biological robot.It was a bioengineered organism just like the ship, designed by the Scraumudi to perform menial, difficult, or dangerous tasks.There were dozens of the little things, scurrying around the ship, doing routine maintenance.Though they all received instructions from the central brain, each was fully autonomous, and they did not send information back to the brain or to each other.The one standing before Marc and Ilene now had already gone over them unnoticed, crawling on the ceiling.But it had noticed them.It was programmed to offer assistance to any Scraumudi that entered the crawlspace, but were Marc and Ilene Scraumudi?Its simple programming was perplexed, so it went down to investigate.Upon completing its visual inspection, it cautiously approached them.Should I step on it?Ilene asked.No!We dont know what will happen.Dont move, Marc ordered.The biot came nearer, and started smelling both of them with its proboscises.Then it started touching them with its tentacles.Marc!Ilene gasped.Stay still, Marc ordered.Becoming bolder, it went so far as to actually climb up on them.Ilene shuddered and closed her eyes, but obeyed Marcs orders.The dimwitted biot came to the conclusion that Marc and Ilene were nothing to worry about, as Levanoch was always adding new wetware to his ship.The biot leapt up onto the ceiling, then began to crawl down the passage they had come down.The both sighed with relief.That was creepy.Surreal even, Ilene said.Im going to call those things attercops, for future reference.Come on, we have to hurry, Marc instructed.Whatever that thing was, it might report us to the Scraumudi.When the Scraumudi first began to employ biots, they had been programmed to report anything out of the ordinary to them.This quickly became an inconvenience however, so the biots were reprogrammed to use their own judgement as to whether or not something constituted a threat.After ten thousand years in the Abyss, without any military campaigns, the standards had become so lax that even two unknown life forms loitering in the crawlspace werent a cause for alarm.The Scraumudis long captivity had indeed dulled the teeth of their war machine.Their ships, while still large and powerful, were no longer built for war or holding prisoners, and more often than not were delegated to proverbial milk runs.The soldiers had grown complacent, and their skills had atrophied.The young had no actual combat experience, and the old (in spite of their delusions they would live forever) were simply too old, and time had diminished their prowess.All of this was most fortunate for the crew of the Deity.Had they been captured ten thousand years ago they would have stood no such chance.The Scraumudi were far more formidable in those ancient days.Even Drkp himself never escaped from his cell when Levanoch imprisoned him before.Were it not for his peoples tessering technology he never would have escaped.This time it was only through the marginal clairvoyance of an otherwise unremarkable Human that had offered him his chance at freedom.Fortunately for them all, Drkp was not a man to waste an opportunity when presented.As Marc and Ilene went onward down the passage, the nerve strands sunk into the flesh of the ship, and it became very dark.They could see some light coming from the next junction a hundred or so meters ahead.The backlight of Marcs palm scanner provided some illumination, but not much.They now had to grope blindly at the wall to keep from walking into it, and they stumbled into each other more than once.As Ilenes hand grazed along the wall, it became caught.Marc, Marc Im stuck, she whispered.What?he asked.My hand is stuck in something sticky!she said.Marc shone his scanner over her left hand, and saw that it was stuck in a mass of something like cobweb.Do you think the attercops made these?Maybe, I dont know.Can you pull yourself free?Marc asked,  Ill try, she said.She started pulling as hard as she could, and the webbing stretched a little, but it did not break or release her.She stopped suddenly when there was an ominous hissing sound, and a noise like a rattlesnake.The web slowly began to retract upward, pulling her hand up with it.Oh no.Marc.Marc!Marc grabbed her other arm and started pulling her away from it with as much strength as he could summon.Ilene felt as though she was being pulled apart by two horses, but she did not stop pulling herself away from the web.Finally the silk snapped, sending Marc and Ilene tumbling back into the junction.It was much more brightly lit than the last one, as many nerve strands converged in it as though it were some sort of ganglia.Ilene sat up, groaning and grasping her left arm.Are you injured?Marc asked.She nodded.Is it broken?No, I think its dislocated, she told him.Marc knelt down to examine it.Yeah its dislocated.Hold still.Im going to pop it back in, he said, placing his hands on her.On three.One, two, three!With one swift movement, he popped the bone back into its socket.Ilene grunted, and then began coddling her arm.Thank you, she said, climbing to her feet.She peeled the lingering strands of silk off her hand.Okay, where are we now?The second junction?Marc nodded.Yeah, were deep inside the ship now.Far from the corridors, Marc replied.Im not picking up any Scraumudi on the palm scanner.We just have to follow that passage there to the next junction, where well find the shaft leading up to the ships brain.Ilene nodded, and they started down the last passage.They feared something even worse might be waiting for them down dark corridor, but they came out to the other end without incident.Before them was the shaft leading up to the control room.Ilene approached it cautiously, examining it.She looked at Marc for conformation to open it.Looking up from his palm scanner, he nodded.Ilene tentatively placed her hand on the white membrane, and it slid open with an alarmingly loud hissing noise.Ilene poked her head into the shaft.The sight of the ominous, oesophageal like tunnel was very daunting to them.It was dark, with only the tiniest amount of light shining down from the top.It led up a hundred meters, just as Helena had told them.A leathery, undulatory tentacle hung down all the way from the top.Ilene slung her rifle over her shoulder, and began to investigate it.She grabbed a firm hold of it and lifted her feet up, to test to see if it could hold her weight.To her surprise, the tentacle began to retract upwards, rapidly carrying her to the top.Blades!Marc shouted as she shot up into the darkness.In a matter of seconds, she had reached the top.The door in front of her immediately slid open, making an oddly pleasant chiming noise as though it were an ordinary elevator.Just as Drkp had said, there was a large, grey brain in the center of the room.It was a meter and a half tall, mushroom shaped, and floating in a translucent vat.It was tethered to the ground by a spinal cord.Standing by a console were two Scraumudi technicians, debating what they should do about Drkp, apparently oblivious to the errant captive.When they did see her, they merely stared in disbelief, uncomprehending how she had come to be there.These were not soldiers, and they had no weapons.They looked at each other questioningly, as if hoping the other would know what the hell they were supposed to do.Ilene leapt into the room, and with two quick shots from her rifle she had incapacitated the two unlucky technicians before they could take any action.Her relief was unfortunately short lived, as she could hear approaching Scraumudi voices on the other side of the rooms large door, who had apparently heard the rifle shots.She glanced down at the rifles controls.There were two knobs; one to control the nature of the discharge, the other to control its intensity.Ilene didnt know this of course, but she fiddled with them anyway to see if they would do anything.She shot at the wall to see what would happen.By luck or providence, she had found a setting that seemed to cauterize flesh.Thinking fast, she shot along the seam of the door, sealing it shut.Hearing movement behind her, she spun around rapidly and nearly fired, until she saw that it was Marc coming out of the shaft.Marc!she cried in relief.He nodded, but before he could actually say anything they heard angry Scraumudi outside the door.Ilene threw her rifle at Marc.You try to take the brain out!Ill watch your ass.Ilene, now without a weapon, assumed what looked like a martial art stance to guard the door.Of course, Ilene didnt actually know any martial arts.Technically, it was a yoga stance, and Ilene figured yoga was a kind of martial art.At the very least it was tangential.The Scraumudi were clawing and ramming at the door, and in only a moment they would break through.Realistically, Ilenes weaponized yoga wouldnt hold them back for more than a few seconds, and that was being generous.Well aware of this, Marc aimed the gun and fired upon the brain.To his dismay, all the discharge did was illuminate the force field protecting the brain for a half second or so.Blades, it didnt work!he cried out alarmed.The knobs on the things do shit, just fuck with them until it works!she instructed, too flustered to be more articulate.The sound of the screaming Scraumudi only meters away was extremely unnerving.Marc turned the top dial (which controlled the power level) as far to the right as it would go.This made the force field glow more brightly and for longer, but no matter how many times he shot it, it wouldnt wear down.On the outside of the room a Scraumudi with a rifle of his own had finally arrived, and shot a hole through the door.Ilene ducked out of the beams path.Marc, quickly!she shouted.Marc turned the lower dial all the way to the right, but this time the discharge bounced off the force field and nearly took his head off.Marc turned the dial all the way to the left this time, and whispered a quick prayer.On this setting, and on full power, the discharge went right through the force field, puncturing the tank.The disgusting fluid flooded out unto the ground.The brain thudded to the floor and rolled out of the tank.Just as a Scraumudi broke through the door, Marc fired upon the brain, and it splattered all across the room.Suddenly the klaxon stopped, the lights flickered, and all the Scraumudi started to spasm and wail in pain.Within seconds they had all collapsed, and lay unconscious on the floor.***      The pair of guards standing watch in front of the Prison Bay were paralyzed with terror at the sight of Drkp speeding towards them.Before they could even point their guns at him, they were telekinetically pulled from their grasp.An intense force pushed them backwards, splattering them against the rear wall like insects on a windshield.With a swift backwards motion of his arms, Drkp easily pulled the door off the Prison Bay.He positioned it to provide some measure of defence against incoming fire for the escapees.The hundreds of captive Humans immediately began grouping around the door to see what had happened, and within seconds the news had passed back through the crowd that Drkp had freed them.While Drkp remained outside to defend against the imminent Scraumudi onslaught, Helena dashed into the Prison Bay.Delansy?Arachnid asked perplexed.What the hells going on?Everybody listen up!Helena shouted.I dont have time to explain now, but all the Scraumudi will be rendered unconscious momentarily, and we will only have roughly ten minutes until they wake up again.You all need to get back to the Deity immediately.Drkp will protect us as we reboard the ship.All able bodies are to report to their posts, and if you were on the task force you need to start apprehending all of the Scraumudi on the Deity.Now go, go, go, go, go!Right down this hall.We wont get another shot at this!With an astonishing burst of speed the crew of the Deity stampeded out into and down the hall, and back through the airlock aboard their own vessel.Those who were unable (or unwilling, as in Sophie and Chikas case) to move themselves were carried by one or more of their fellow crewmates.Helena remained by the door, making sure everyone headed the right way.Drkp stood firmly in position, his clenched fists held outwards, with three Scraumudi rifles levitating in front of him, ready to fire at any incoming enemies.Even over the noise of the escaping Humans, Drkp could hear the hissing Scraumudi charging towards him.When the first wave became visible, Drkp turned the rifles to automatic fire.The trinary beams rendered the narrow hallway a killing field.Most of the Scraumudi fell to the ground, with large portions of their bodies disintegrated, before they could even get off a shot.Drkp was easily able to deflect what little incoming fire came his way.The Scraumudi were aghast that a single Reticulan could slay so many of them so easily.He was utterly immune to their weapons.He was a legendary nemesis, and to their horror he was no less powerful than the legends had made him out to be.They would have done the smart thing and fled for their lives, had Levanoch not arrived when he did.Dont stop fighting now you maggots!he berated from the back of the troop.Keep forcing him to shoot!His guns will soon be powerless at the rate hes firing.Those of you who die now will be resurrected, but if you allow him to live you shall be cast into the Blood Star and condemned to Eternal Death.Keep fighting!With that threat spurring them onwards, the Scraumudi did not relent their attack on Drkp.Levanoch had been right of course.One of Drkps rifles soon ceased firing; then the second, and then the third.Thinking him now helpless, they dashed madly towards him, firing wildly.Still, not a single shot so much as singed his robes.The foremost of the Scraumudi pounced towards, screeching.When he was mere inches from his face, Drkp released a telekinetic wave so powerful it reverberated through the living flesh of the ship.Every single Scraumudi in the corridor was blasted backwards, congealing into a mass of slithering black snakes.Taking advantage of their disorientation, Drkp focused his will upon every one of their rifles, and caused them to explode.The Scraumudi screamed out in agony as they were enveloped by a searing flash of bright blue light.Drkp conjured a vortex of air that lifted him over a meter off the ground.Upon that tornado he charged into the mass of Scraumudi bodies to take out any stragglers.Pieces of carcass were splattered in every direction as he flew passed.He held stationary for a moment, twisting around to see if there were any survivors.Before he could complete his survey, a Scraumudi lunged at him from behind, knocking him off of his air vortex.It was Levanoch.Drkp was too disoriented from the blow to take immediate action.Holding him in place with his left hand, Levanoch raised his right claw, ready to eviscerate the horrid little Grey.Just as Drkp came to his full senses, Levanoch let out a wretched screech and began convulsing spasmodically.Within seconds he fell unconscious to the floor.It took a moment for Drkp to realize what had just occurred.When he did, he leapt to his feet and ran as quickly as he could towards the airlock.Is everyone out?he asked Helena as he reached the Prison Bay.She nodded.Everyones back on the Deity, she replied.Good.I have to get to the bridge.You stay here and wait for Marc and Ilene, he instructed.Right, she nodded.She followed Drkp as far as the airlock.Once he was through, she stepped inside, and there on the very cusp of the umbilical dock, she crouched down and waited for Marc.Levanoch stirred.He was the most powerful of all the Scraumudi, both in body and mind, so he was the first to awake.He felt weak.He could hardly move.Pain shot all through his body, his carapace felt as if it was burning.His brain felt like it was in a vice, and his vision was distorted.He was very disoriented.At first, he couldnt even remember what had happened.He tried to rise up, but quickly succumbed to vertigo and fell back to the ground.Dragging himself along the floor, he hoisted himself up to a manual interface, and pressed his fell hand into it.In the control room, Marc and Ilene stared in disbelief at each other, as a horde of vicious Scraumudi lay unconscious at their feet.Marc was the first to laugh, and Ilene soon joined him.She ran to him and then threw her arms around him.We did it!she cheered.We still have to get off this ship, Marc reminded her.He handed her back the rifle and gestured to the shaft.After you.Ilene slung the rifle over her shoulder, went to the shaft and slid down the tentacle as if it were a firefighter poll.
