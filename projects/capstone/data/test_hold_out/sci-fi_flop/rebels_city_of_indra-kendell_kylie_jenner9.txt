I stand across from her.Rage, resentment, and regret flowing between us.Were both crying.Its been too long since weve rested.The toll this day has taken overwhelms us both.We blame each other when neither is to blame.It takes a lot of silence for me to come to that conclusion.Theres a long, dark tunnel to travel below.We each grab a line and descend to join the others.Roscoe silently follows.32           Lex   The rebels are smart enough to keep ahead of Roscoe, Livia, Kane, and me.Im stuck with the old man, and Livia isnt helping.Shes acting fascinated by everything, asking a million things.Shes trying to act as though nothing happened.Doesnt want anyone to see her upset maybe.That is the polite response, I guess.Polite, Ive decided, is a waste of everyones time.No one asks the real questions, of course.The ones that matter.How do twins end up perfect strangers?I want to ask.And where are we going?Instead, we learn about the pipe.How its part of an abandoned water drilling facility.Of course, there is no water to be drilled anymore, Roscoe says.Not from the Lower Levels.We depleted those resources long ago.Which, of course, is the very reason Indra moved upward.All water is now stored in the Aero Crown.Shut up, Im thinking.Or say something that matters.Something I didnt learn in Indrithian History.Are you okay?whispers Kane.No, I say.He looks worried.Ill be fine.He nods, but I can tell hell keep asking.This guy, Roscoe, just turned everything upside down, and now he wont stop talking about pipes.These pipes are key to Lower Level survival.They act as transport for scavenged items, though much of the Lower Level is self sufficient.No one above suspects, of course.The pipes serve no purpose, and therefore do not exist.Right now, I wish he didnt.Others, he continues, have been appropriated to siphon water from the City of Indras supply, bringing it to the populace below.Only fair.An eye for an eye.Where is that from?asks Kane.It is from a book, Roscoe tells him.The Book of Indra?I dont think so.No, says Roscoe, smiling, A real book.One of many we keep in our possession.There are no real books, I say, annoyed.There is only The Book of Indra.There is more on heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy.That is from another book that is not The Book of Indra, but what the scribe means is that much has been kept from you.No kidding, I say.I stare at him, waiting for the rest of the story.For him to talk about my birth, my family, my existence.Theres more than the sister part, thats for sure.Though that is plenty already.Nothing.He just keeps walking.Okay, I say.Tell me something, then.Something kept from me.Roscoe smiles at me.The kind of smile you give a child.A child who infiltrated the IHC, I think.Who can fly a stolen PCF patroller.Who can outsmart a whole unit of Population Controls finest.So ease back, old man.Then show me these books, I say.Prove it.In fact, I think its about time you start proving a lot of things.You remind me so much of your mother, he says.Cheap shot, and it totally works.For a second I lose my words.All of them.I look at Livia, and she turns away.But I know what she is thinking.Our mother.Ah, he says, before I can regroup, we shall continue this later.This, my friends, is our destination.33           Livia   I wait patiently for Roscoe to unlock the mysteries of the universe, but we have only reached a small cavern.He and the other rebels have a quick, hushed exchange before they leave us alone.Lex stands by herself, sullen and despondent, barely looking upward when one of them addresses us.Roscoe is tall and sleepy eyed, and has removed his PCF attire, revealing an ascot and waistcoat.The kind Proper Gentlemen don for formal occasions, only his is rather filthy and fraying.I wouldnt worry too much, he says to us all, though his shy smile is directed toward me.I once heard its like giving birth.You forget the pain after its done.With these words, Lex returns to us, her fierceness stronger than ever.Forget the pain after ...what?What are you talking about, Roscoe?You have till ten to tell me whats going on or  Or youll what?says Zavier coolly.Hes watching her with narrowed eyes and a far from amused expression.Havent you realized by now?None of us want you harmed.Except you, I think, sensing something beneath his collected exterior.Hes correct, says Roscoe.They risked their lives for us, Lex, says Kane.Vipsinia is still up there.Lex turns to me, meeting my eyes for the first time since entering the cavern.She glares at me, yet I know this is an excuse; she is searching for an answer in my face.They are telling the truth, I say with my eyes.Well?she says, turning back to them.What do we have to do?They dont want us harmed, that much is clear to me.Yet I feel something else that unhinges me: theyre worried.Deeply, profoundly worried.And what will happen in that cavern will be deeply, profoundly unpleasant.Lex   Livia trusts them.I see it in her face.And I figure I have no other choice.I turn my back to Zavier.Well, I say to Roscoe, what do we have to do?Lexie?interrupts a voice.I turn.A girl stands at the entrance.Is that you?Lex, I tell her.She stares at me.She is around my age, I think.And something in her face stops my fury cold.Stops everything cold.It is you!she says, breaking into a huge smile.I knew youd correct me if I called you the wrong name.Then she does something completely crazy.She hugs me.And even crazier?I let her.I dont exactly hug her back.Just stand there, my arms stiff at my sides.Second hug in one day, I think.This is getting ridiculous.Everyone needs to learn to keep their hands off me.Yet I dont push her off either.She finally steps back.I know you hated every second of that.But I couldnt help it.Its been so long.I dont know you, I tell her softly.I dont want to hurt her feelings.Im not sure why I even care.Part of me wishes I did know her.There is something about her that calms me.You do, she says.Look closer.She is a normal girl, nothing special.Except the glow, maybe.It seems to come from under her skin.Livia   Her name is 374, Roscoe says.She also goes by Samantha.In fact, she has not been 374 since you last saw her.Ill always be 374, she responds, smiling at Lex.Lex, if you can believe it, smiles back.It isnt a big smile, but its genuine.Like a childs.They both have numbers.They were both in the Orphanage.I didnt know the two of you were connected until I was planning your rescue.Thats when Samantha told me of a Lex she had known.What a strange, small world!Roscoe smiles at Lex, who is still in shock.Im sure you have a great deal to discuss and there will be ample time to reconnect later.But we thought, for now, perhaps, having Samantha here might make the process easier.The girl, Samantha, leans over to Lex.The others pretend not to listen.I will tell you everything later, she says.For now, you must do as they ask.There isnt much time.But Ill be right here with you.I could even braid your hair.Lex simply nods, entering the room by her side without question.Kane and I follow, and for a second, I feel almost jealous.This quiet young woman has the power to calm Lex, a gift I had thought not possible.That, it occurs to me, is how one would treat a sister.Then again, how was I to know?Ive had a sister for only a few hours and our history together has mostly consisted of attempts on each others lives.But it seems even Samanthas powers have their limits.We have a what in our what?Lex shrieks.Samantha holds her hand, and now Lex squeezes back so hard I can almost feel a phantom pressure on my own palm.Mandatory temporal lobe implant, says Roscoe.In laymans terms, a small chip, barely the size of a fingernail.In our brains?Yes, I say, understanding all too clearly.Somewhere between the optical nerve and temple, if I were to make an educated guess.The part of the brain that controls memory.You, Roscoe says, are so very much like your father, Livia.So you say, I fire back.He peddles memories that are of no use to me right now.They dull my focus.I try to soften my approach.Perhaps I am right to assume this chip chronicles every moment of our existence.And that information is used to store our history in the Archives.Yes, says Roscoe.Among other uses.Other uses?asks Kane.The chip also monitors your whereabouts, your location, at every moment.For a second, I wonder if I will vomit right here, in front of all of them.The sickness in my stomach is overwhelming.My whole life has been monitored, I realize.I have been watched, just as I felt I had been, only not quite in the way I imagined.They have been watching from inside my own head.I have thought millions of terrible things.Have they seen it all?That is how the PCF knew where to find us, I say.But if this proves true, how would we have escaped?Why the lag time in locating us?Roscoe nods.Hes impressed with my questioning, though flattered is the last thing I feel.Horrified is a more apt description.As Im sure you are aware, you and Lex are of a unique genetic configuration.I assume it took them longer due to the complexity of your psychological makeup and brain functions.They did find us, nonetheless.Yes, and will again.Even with your curious genetics and the distance weve placed between ourselves and Indra, eventually you will be discovered.And then they will come for you.We cannot risk going any farther toward our headquarters until it is removed.And we are prepared to do just that here.And Kane?I ask, noticing that he has gone silent and rather pale.Kane is lucky enough that his was extracted at the Independent High Council.Lucky, says Kane quietly, is not the word Id use.Theyll have sent it away for full analysis, Roscoe says.Standard detainment procedure.In the hopes of understanding the motivation of those who defy Indra and preventing future crime.You were rescued before they could reimplant it, I assume?Kane shrugs.If they did, I dont remember.Then he must be reexamined, Zavier says abruptly.I bet youre enjoying this, Lex says.Haunted, I decide, is a perfect way to describe his expression.The opposite, if you really want to know.I despise this.Everything about it.Why is he even here?Lex asks.Because, says Roscoe, he will be performing the procedure.He is the only one who knows how.34           Lex   Samantha hasnt said a word the whole time.Just holds my hand tight.When I try to pull away, she just clutches harder.Now that Im stretched out across a makeshift sleeper, shes still holding on.Im right here, she seems to be saying.Im not going anywhere.I wish I could, though.Go anywhere else but here.They just shoveled out some dirt and put up a door and called this a room.We had better in the Orphanage.The walls are packed earth, the floor rocky and uneven.In other words, exactly the place you dont want an experimental medical procedure.Not that wed been given an option.Zavier explains that when they found the room it was filled with bones, probably dating back to the Separationwhen the colonists extricated themselves from the Lower Levels to build the Upward City of Indra, as it was first known.There were drill rigs stripped for parts and shattered skulls beneath the soil.Livias first.She sits on the exam table while Zavier runs a buzzing paddle over her head.The paddles connected to a weird contraption that Im surprised even functions.This, Im told, is her initial scan.Strange, says Zavier, checking the monitor.Shes only at twenty percent.Ive never seen that before.Roscoe nods.I take it you have uncommon sensory abilities, Livia, am I correct?To intuit beyond everyday surface emotions?She nods.Ha, I think.Thats how it feels.When someone can see into your head.Not so great being on the other side, huh?Well, then we are doubly fortunate.The procedure is not necessary in your case.At thirty percent or less, they do not have clear access to your inner workings.Livia looks relieved.Of course, she got off easy.This is the story of her life.Perhaps you will have good news, too, she says in passing.That is hardly the story of mine.Zavier lifts the paddle and I imagine the worst.The scanning process is slow and torturous, but entirely without pain, so far.Seventy four percent, he says.Roscoe is not so quick to declare anything this time.Great, I say.Lets get to it then.Bust open my brain.Just hurry up before I change my mind.Livia and Kane can stay with you, Roscoe tells me.As can I.   You dont have to do that.I dont want them to see me like this.He tells me it will be fine.I want it to be, but Im not sure.I find no qualities in him that make him better than any other leader.They all use fear as a weapon to control, and right now I fear its working.I dont want anyone to see me afraid.Having Zavier do this is humiliating enough.I sit through Kanes scan and hes proven correct that there wasnt sufficient time to reimplant his chip.He holds my hand and I let him do it, but only briefly.Judging by how everyone is treating me?These could be my final thoughts.I will be silenced, here where plenty of dead have rested before me.The City of Indra was built on graves.Livia wants to stay, but she respects my wishes.Samantha doesnt.I wont argue with her.Secretly, Im pleased.To not be alone.I know its almost time.She kneels at my side while I lie back in a cot.Shes trying to distract me, I know.Keeping me from watching Zavier prep.I always thought I was going to reach twelve, she says.To be free of the Orphanage, instead of it freeing itself from me.At least I was pretty sure.And the caretakers even hinted good things were just ahead.Everyone liked you, I say.I know.I worked hard to make that happen.A hissing noise.I look at Zavier, adjusting a dial on a machine that looks like it lacks an ounce of design or sterility.That way, says Samantha, turning my chin toward her, they never suspected what I was really up to.Remember how I would disappear?I nod.You told me it was a secret.It was.I hated that place.The whole thing.The disappearing, the not knowing who wasor if you werenext.I wanted to know why it happened.Make sense of this senseless act.We were already in the Orphanage.Our flaws were right there on the surface.We were never wanted in the first place.But complaining?That wouldnt do much except get me bottomed out myself.You had no flaws.She laughs.Your memories treat me better than I deserve.I could tell her my memory is practically flawless and that she exists there only exactly as she was, but I want to hear her story so desperately.I made everyone like me.The perfect orphan.That way, they never suspected.I started taking the tags when I was just in the Intermediate Dorm.The ones on the new arrivals.Id go in there, right after the babies had been labeled, with their Gs for Genetic Flaw and Ps for Pass.And Id snip them right off and drop them in the incinerator.Indra has evaluators throughout the levels who work hard to select out those who will contribute to its continued success.But our lives arent predetermined.Look at us!Look who weve become!And I must admit, I enjoyed the chaos.Theyd lock down the unit, trying to decipher which baby was a dud, which did they already agree to approve?I remember!I say.It happened all the time!The caretakers would be running around, totally pissed.And it was you!For almost a year.Not that it did much good.Only bought the kids a few extra days.But maybe, maybe one got through.I had to be on the right track if it pissed them off so much.I can hardly speak.Samantha is just as strato as I remember.Of course, they caught me, right before I turned twelve.They tried to guilt me.We had big plans for you, Samantha.Placement in Hubber Organization.And now look what youve done!Hubber Organization.Putting supplies in the right pile.Like Id given my whole life away.And then?They said I was going to Rock Bottom, same place I came from.I mean, it isnt as bad as everyone said.I could remember from where I came.Some memories of my parents before they died.For many, Rock Bottom is horrible, but therere good things there too.Some of us even have families.For so long I believed what they wanted, but now I dont have to.She glances at Zavier, who is watching us now.Even gives him a smile.He looks away.But the stories of the orphans being brought out to the Lower Levels and given over to the mutationsthat didnt happen?Not to me.Thats a story that instructors tell.I was put on a transporter with some others.Wed pick up more at the other orphanages along the way.There are more?She nods.Once you were gone, I say, I saw that there were so many orphans who needed someone like you.I tried, but I ...I tried to help some of them, but it didnt work.I couldnt even help one of them the way that you helped me.And the whole time I thought that it was me that got you bottomed out.No, she says, caressing my face, rubbing my tears dry.Im truly sorry you had to carry that with you over the years.It was you, little 242, that let me know that my efforts werent wasted.That change is possible, even if its one orphan at a time.Even if you did follow me around like a shadow.I cant help but smile.Its time, says Zavier.He cant look at me.Hes not being a jerk, I realize.Even though its his natural state.Zaviers nervousness is not a good sign.Have you done this before?I ask.Yes, he says.A lot?Once.Howd it go?He doesnt answer.Did they die?Distracting me while Im calibrating only increases your risk.I have more questions.Mostly about where he got his training.I imagine they dont have high standards for medical care down below.The machine makes a grinding noise.Im sure thats normal, Samantha says, still by my side.This procedure should take less than five minutes, he says.Ill talk you through, even when youre in a state of noncoherence.He pulls a rubber gripped tool from the contraption, and contact with the air makes it spark.Its end is a delicate yet nightmare inducing spike.This will go in your ear, he says, waving it gently.The gleaming metal bends slightly, and its malleability doesnt make it more attractive.Im suddenly nauseous.Maybe Ill pass out, I think hopefully.Samantha squeezes my hand.I squeeze back and hold it tight.Hold it like Im holding on for my life.Another spark.My ears home in on that sharp burst.It overwhelms my eardrums.Ready?he says.I nod yes, then immediately shake my head no.Hes already moving toward me.Close your eyes, he says.Try to relax and take deep breaths.Im sorry about your friend, I tell him.But I didnt kill him, okay?Whether you believe that or not.So dont kill me.A look crosses over his face.Sympathy?He feels sorry for me, and that is the worst part of all.Do this already, I demand, and close my eyes.The only way to remove the chip is by disabling the signal with sound, Zavier says.A series of high pitched sonic waves at an accelerated frequency.And to do that, we must get as close to the chip as possible.Thats when I feel the spike easing into my ear.Slow and steady.Cold metal going straight for my brain.I will go fast, Lex.Fast as I possibly can.In a second you will feel pain.But that only lasts a few moments.Instantly, my brain is on fire, like its going to explode out of my skull.Im fighting to endure it, fighting not to freak out, and I open my mouth to shriek, when it cuts short and all that comes out, I think, is a whimper.There.Thats the worst of it.Now there is just a faint ache, the foreign metal uncomfortably icy against my eardrum.Can you hear me, Lex?That sucked, I say in a hollow voice.Youre doing fine.In a second Ill release the first frequency.That will affect the part of the temporal lobe that controls language skills.Well use hand gestures to communicate since you wont be able to speak for the rest of the procedure.Does that include screaming?Can you hear me?Zavier says.Wiggle your fingers.It sounds easy, but my hands are dead weights.What has he really done to me?Wiggle, I think.Cmon.Wiggle.I felt it, Samantha says, then softly whispers in my unspiked ear, Youre doing good.Real good.Im sending the second frequency now, Zavier says.Then there is only one more to go.This time, like the last, I can hear the frequency all too well.Its like a speeder racing directly overhead, or an uncomfortably close blaster bolt.Suddenly, I cant feel my body, and I worry that this is permanent.I can no longer hear out of either ear.My bodys going into shock.Im spasming uncontrollably and Samantha holds me down, but Im only getting worse.I cant fight it.My vision goes hazy.I feel like dying, but Samanthamy lifelinewont let me.My eyes are rolling up and someones pressing something hard in my mouth, and every time my body shakes, I bite down on this thing and I buck hard enough that Zavier has to come hold me down.Thats when I lose touch with my body.Its just a shell now.That Im trapped in.It has served me well, but I cant hold on anymore.Im not strong enough.Im not strong enough.Im not strong.35           Livia   How are you feeling?I ask.Lexs eyes flicker open and appear a little glazed over, as though she has no idea who I am.In many ways, she doesnt, but I cannot help but worry.Especially when she tries to stand up and her legs give out.Kane and I catch her and sit her down.Zavier explained she would be light headed and disoriented, her equilibrium clearly affected, but it will pass as her body adjusts.Just lay there for now, I say.She nods.Zavier has already called it a success.After disabling the chip, he was able to extract it without risking further damage.We will stay here until Lex recovers.Roscoe has sent the rest of the rebels ahead.There are many factions down here, and not all are friendly to their cause.Territory changes possession every day, and we must be sure that well be granted safe passage as we avoid the Hub and all the heavily trafficked zones.For now it feels good to rest and sit.To fill the time, Kane and I share stories about the Islands.Afterward, I do not find that I miss them much at all.I tell him he was lucky to have been able to join the Academy.I surprise him with tales of my swordsmanship, and I tell him something Ive never told anyone else: how I discovered my mothers sword locked away in a case under their sleeper.Id been woken by a nightmare and hid under there in the early morning.At first touch the sounds it made startled me, but I refused to let it go and clutched it against my chest, and in my memory it hummed me to sleep.Kane looks shocked.Through his eyes, my adventurous streak makes me blush.It makes me feel ...silly.Once we start talking, we cant stop.Yet we dance around our first meeting.I err on the side of proper while he ...perhaps Ive scared him.The day has grown long into night and we lean against each other for support.His touch awakens my body, warming me in the cool eaves of this hollowed earth, though I know perhaps that his intentions are confusing.I would like to close my eyes and dream awhile.It would be nice.His eyes close and his bruised body relaxes, and I gather him against me.Hes a strange boy.They could all be this way, I think.For all weve talked, I still know little about him.He could still be a danger to me.That, I must never forget.When Lex is strong enough to sit upright by herself, Samantha breaks bits off a ration bar and feeds them to her.Were all given one bar each to eat.I saw things, Lex says.I only wish I could remember what they were.Most certainly your memories returning to you, Roscoe says.It will take time, but they are there now.The rebels return and the news isnt great.A clan of mutations has taken over the unfinished transit path that would give us the most direct route back to their base.So whats the plan?Lex says.If you have another one, that is.Her voice is combative and angry.In other words, shes herself again.This floods me with relief.Well head for the Old Town Safe Zone, Zavier says.This clan cant have taken that from us.Just make sure your blastersre charged and stick close to one another, all right?Theres a snort.You got something to say, Marley?Zavier walks over to a short, scruffy rebel, his head bursting with knotted clumps of hair.He snorts again.No one abides by no Safe Zone.Zones an illusion that ends when the crossfire begins.Cant just dance on through there expecting to get a heros welcome.You got a better idea?Cut through Unifier territory.Theyll be too busy counting their supplies to notice.With a group this large?Theyll think its a raid.Then we split up, half with you, half with me.The girls are our only priority, says Zavier.Even that one?Marley asks, pointing at Kane.The jab doesnt wound Kane.Even this one, he replies.Marley chuckles, and some of the other rebels laugh along.Youll all be dead in under two minutes and then well be free to go whichever way we want.I give them two seconds, says another.Lex clenches her jaw, her anger rising; I know the signs.Within a few moments she will combust.Silence, Roscoe says.Zavier is right.The Safe Zone is the most logical choice.We can blend in there long enough to pass through.Roscoes word is law.There is no further dissent.Let us now, my brothers, have a moment of reflection, says Roscoe, joining hands with those nearest him, to contemplate a time before our movement found you.We all come together.I was of the air.My sister, for the briefest moment, must have been, too.We are reunited here below Indra for reasons beyond our comprehension.I suspect the history of our world was broken long before we took our first breaths together.Perhaps this is the start of something else.Something new.Theyll see you a mile off in that thing, says Chae, handing me a coarse black cloak.He gives one to Lex, and she drops it over her body suit.Zavier draws figures in the dirt, showing each rebel their placement for when we pass through Old Town.Stay close to Lex and Livia, but with enough distance so you dont draw undue attention.As for the two of you, he says, motioning my sister and me over, keep your head down.And for all our sakes, do not engage under any circumstances.Our customs are complex.He smirks, glancing in Lexs direction.Even though for some, I suspect this will be difficult.We gather our blasters and gear that weve shed, and its finally time.Chae rolls the portal open; it slides along its ancient tracks with the sound of stone grinding against stone.He disappears into the darkness, the others immediately following.One by one, the rebels are gone.Samantha stays by our side, our native guardian.Its not so bad, she says.In fact, you might just like it here.Kane sees my apprehension, catches my eye, and winks.Ready?I ask Lex.I was born ready.Same time as you, actually.I wonder which of us is older?Im about to enter the most dangerous territory in all the Lower Levels.Yet nothing will surprise me as much as seeing Lex almost smile.At the door, I take a deep breath and a huge step into the unknown.36           Lex   The Hub casts off massive amounts of energy.That energy heats up the Lower Levels, especially when you factor in your proximity to the core.The heat can create a weird haze, almost a fog, and my newly gifted cloak traps it too well.Kane stumbles frequentlyperhaps it is the booster wearing offand our crews progress is slower than it should be.Is this the Safe Zone?I ask Zavier.Not yet, he says.His not quite gentle manner during the procedure has reverted to indifference.Hes threatened by me, I think.Close?Youll know it when you see it.I lose track of the other rebels in the haze.Its easier to keep my eyes focused on Livia and Kane and try to follow their footsteps.I try not to read into their pairing.Theyve kissedI mean, its not easy to forget, but.Its just easier to try to.I keep walking.Zavier says Ill know it when I see it, but I start to hear it first.Voices holler over the thick bass kicks.The music is loud and greasy.I must hear it in advance of the rest because theyre wary when the lights dance through the murkiness.In the Lower Levels, its always night.Harsh beams of white and flashing neon red announce the entry to Old Town, a freakish light show that could make you sick if you stare too long.Home sweet home.I whistle.Zavier ignores me.Through there, he says, indicating a narrow walkway cutting between scrap plating.Corrugated hovels are built into each other.A man stumbles out of one, howling with laughter or pain, its hard to decipher, then falls to the ground, stone still.Is he dead?I ask.Maybe.You never know around here.I know hes messing with my head.I can hear it in his voice.Still ...This is the Safe Zone?Even the Academy sims dont prepare you for the squabble of day to day existence down here.Our final sim didnt replicate the stench or the decaying atmosphere.Wed only been given a loose interpretation.They layer their lies with just enough reality.They taught us order with our uniforms and rows of cots.But chaos?How do you prepare for that?Cmon, says Zavier.Act like youve seen it before, I tell myself.Like this is nothing new.I follow him across the main boulevard, a claustrophobic walkway of uneven rocks.The hovels are stacked on top of each other, their tops disappearing into the fog, which disguises the enormity of the Safe Zone.Somewhere, far above, is a domed slab of rock.Youd never know, except for the echo of greasy Rock Bottom rhythms.The scavs shove past us, some pushing their wares in our faces: expired rations or previously used blades and stunners.Getcher emissions right here!Flares, sparkers, particle beamers!Highest voltage in the dirtlands, cant beat the price!Water capsules, honey?Youre lookin a little parched ...Get you messed up.Two minutes, wont know your own name.Chewers, sniffers, lickers, any way you like it!Best stuff in and out of the Zone.Zavier puts an arm around me and pulls me in tight.A look from him to the vendors communicates quite clearly his level of disinterest.A filthy man pushes something in my face.Half a dried out wafer held between two black fingernails.He reeks of dead things.Yummy?he says.No, Zavier barks.Get.I turn my head and a blaster is pointed right in my face.Ill give you a good price, says the man thing holding it.He turns it sideways for a better view.Youre gonna need it, pretty pretty.Gotta protect yourself, yknow?Got us some untrustworthy types round here.He cackles.I flash the one Im packing.He scurries off to the next mark.My heads throbbing.I cant get enough air.Im starting to wheeze.Livia, I think.All that rich Upper atmosphere, she cant be better off.These scavs are making me mighty protective.I spot Kane first.Hes pushing through a huddle of half naked women.They giggle, blow him kisses.New in town?says one.Let me give you a private tour.She reaches out, runs a finger down his cheek.Marley pushes between them.Leave the kid alone, he says, shoving Kane forward.Theres Samantha crouched in front of a little girl missing her right arm.The girl babbles excitedly.Glad to have someone listen.Samantha says something, ruffles the girls hair, and rises.She hasnt lost her touch.Dont get distracted, says Zavier gruffly.I cant find Livia, I say.Shes fine.Shes got someone watching her.Not much more of this anyway.Now stay focused.I mean it.Stay focused or youll screw this up for everyone.I whip my head to face him.Hes looking at me like Im lower than dirt.Lower than Rock Bottom itself.Hes almost snarling.I hate him.Every inch of him.Were getting muscled by passing scavs.He grabs my arm.Whats got into you?I shove him away and lose him in the crowd.I get grabbed for like the fifth time.Theyve got no sense of personal space.I try to pull myself away, but I cant.The hand is massive; its fisted around my biceps.Before I can shout to the others, before I can do anything, another hand covers my mouth and Im being pulled backward.It happens so quickly I can barely think.Im dragged through the door of one of the scrap hovels and thrown on the dirt floor.Before I can draw my blaster, Im staring down the long barrel of a ventilator.At least, thats what everyone in SpecOps calls it because it leaves such large, nasty holes.Though hes wrapped in a tattered gray cloak, I can see his SpecOps silitex enhanced body armor beneath it.His faceplate is a mutated orange skull on a field of chipped black.If this man ever truly served on Rock Bottom Patrol, he looks like hes gone completely core low native.Are you a rebel?he says.If youve turned your back that fully on your oath, I will blast you into the stinking mud.No, I practically spit.Only the unworthy dwell down here.He doesnt take the ventilator off me.SpecOps Lex, you have been found derelict of your duty.You have stolen PCF craft and made illegal incursions on Helix Island, on a mutinous rig, and in the chambers of the High Council.Are you really SpecOps?I say.You do not know me.Know only that your penalty for treason is death.Im not a rebel, I say.Whatever you think, Im not that.The ventilator hums so much, all I can think of is Livias damn singing sword.Must every weapon cry before it kills?You want me to lead you to their base?I say.I will kill you, then find it myself.I look at him and I cannot believe that this is where my future would have led if I hadnt committed every crime hes accused me of.Im not a rebelon the oath I swore, I am not.But I believe someone within the High Council has ordered the death of the Helix Island airess, and possibly my own by this point, and the rebels have answers.Answers that I need to know.Will you at least hear me out?His breath rasps beneath his faceplate.The ventilator is so close I could kiss it.And it would return my kiss with death.Please.Tell me your name.Lieutenant Hauser.D Troop.The name almost shocks me up onto my feet, but I know if I move, the ventilator will bark.I knew a Hauser.He spoke to me at the Academy.You spoke to us after the rebels attacked the Hub.One hundred and twenty two dead.If you think that truly Ive forgotten those people, or the oath I swore to protect them, then kill me now.I push my forehead against his ventilator.If this world is at all worth living in, if not all the PCF are corrupt, then this wont be my end.Then I remember how off my judgments been the past few days, and how its all led me to be in this position, seated in the dirt miles below the surface, closer to the core than Ive ever been before, and Im terribly, terribly scared.With my eyes closed, all I see is darkness.37           Lex   I open my eyes when I can no longer feel the ventilators touch between them.Hauser holds it by his side.He motions me up.I will follow you, he says.At any moment, if I feel you betray me, I will kill you and everyone who stands by your side.Do you understand?I nod.You will bring me to the Rebel Base.After that, you will be brought back for judgment before the Court of Honors, but your assistance here could help sway their judgment.Aside from that, your only other option is death.Know that I need no other companion than death, and he is forever by my side.Standing just feet away from him in this barren hovel that smells of rot and sulfur, I see that his hands are scarred and blistered.He doesnt take his eyes off of me, and I wonder, if this is the same man I met years ago, what he hides beneath his faceplate.Could it be more monstrous than this face he chooses to present?He opens the door just wide enough for me to slip through, and Im relieved to be back in the throng of scavs along the boulevard.I dont know what will come of this bargain.I have saved my own life, but put others in danger.Im still SpecOps, that remains my sworn allegiance, but this world is more complicated than blind duty affords.I push my way through the pack and try not to look over my shoulder.It is to my relief that I find Samantha first.Have you seen Livia?I ask.Shes with Chae.But you really shouldnt be alone.Wheres Z?Who cares where that jerk is, I say.She smiles.Hes stubborn, for sure.Just stay with me, okay?Her face is full of kindness.I nod, feeling about six years old.When we get there, I may just take her up on her earlier offer to braid my hair.It for sure could use it.And then I remember that Hauser may consider her a rebel, too.I look behind me but dont see his massive frame.He is too good to be spotted so easily.Navigating the free for all is easier with her.Shes comfortable here and doesnt fight against the crowd like I do.Shes part of it.Its not so bad, she says.Its rough, but theres beautiful places, too.Ill show you.Wouldnt it be nice to have a new start?I hang on to her words.I want to believe in what she says.A place to stop running.It feels like a make believe.It usually is.I just cant turn that alert side of me off.I cant see the good in these people here.The world is divided, even down here.I stick my fingers in my ears for just a second.My flaw means Im hearing everything way too loudly.This massive wall of noise.It masks the danger were in.It could even mask blaster fire.Livia   The crowds trying to trample me.I dont know if its the change in oxygen levels down here or just the air quality, but Im getting light headed.I make it a priority to draw in deep breathes, but even hugging the side of the marketplace, I keep getting knocked about, the scavs sweaty flesh pressing against me as they fall, the smell intensified by their fear.They dont mean to kill me, but they will if I continue to do nothing.Theyre scurrying, trying to get to safety.And I still cant pinpoint whats causing the panic.Everyone was just fighting for my attention; now theyre just fighting.I lose myself, trying to understand the words jabbering out of all their mouths.Theres a hard tug on my elbow.Cmon, Marley says.Hes not messing about.Then I hear a sound that no human could make and lose track of what I was doing and only want to flee.Marley is far ahead of me already, his legs carrying him fast in the opposite direction.Will time reveal all these rebels to be such cowards?The second howl doesnt come as much of a surprise, even more savage and desperate.It hungers.It has hungered before.What sort of creature has been bred down here?As the scavs thin out, my focus is drawn through the fog to the creature wading through the strangers, a head taller than any of these cave dwellers.I have never seen a more hideous creature, not in the Archives, not even in my imagination.Perhaps somewhere in the layers of time, its genetics started off as human, but it has mutated into a nightmarish beast.Its face droops and is swollen and bulbous, its hair only stringy patches.Its flesh is riddled with sores from the shoulders down.It opens the cavity of its moutha black cave of spittle and rotand screams again.The scream is answered by another.And another.Their fractured voices have shattered the Safe Zone with thunder.Theyre hunting us.Always something is hunting us.Move, I think, yet my legs wont obey.The first creature spots me, its motions no longer aimless.It holds a rust eaten harpoon, which it lifts over its shoulder as it aims.A mutation.Thats the word for this thing.That is the name on the scavs mouths, the same as the name of my death.Blaster fire erupts, and I can only assume it is Zavier and the rebels coming to our defense.But this blaster sounds unlike any I have ever heard, booming through the cavern.Rock blows out from the walls and the surviving mutations roar even louder.I should draw my zinger.I should.I really should.The harpoon goes flying, quicker than I can grab my next breath.It will spear me, then drag me back to its feet for ...feeding?My legs give out as someone shoves me down from behind.Woozy, I pull myself to my feet.The harpoon has missed me and plunged deep into the chest of another.The mutation drags its victim toward it, leaving a trail of blood behind.The creature roars.The body bumps across the rocky terrain.I dash toward the harpoon line.I grab the line in front of the body and pull it with all my might.The mutation howls at me defiantly, the other end of the line held in its grasp.The cord burns my palms as we struggle for control.I pull the zinger from under my cloak and strike the taut line.The creature falls backward, landing with an impact I feel under my feet.It moans and tosses itself from side to side, a writhing mass struggling to get back on the disfigured stumps it uses for feet.It will get there if I let it.It has survived this long in the toxic wastelands; it will always find a way.I sprint at the fallen creature.The zinger plays furiously, my first full melody, a moment for which I should feel accomplished, as the mutations monstrous head separates from its body.Lex, I think, as it rolls over toward my feet, what have I done?38           Lex   Hausers ventilator nearly deafens me.I see him light up a mutation, and it explodes along an upper ridge.I quickly draw my blaster and get him in my sights.Hauser, you cant miss him, is drawing down on another mutation, marching along the same boulevard that we entered from.Its long and lean and its face is all exposed bone.I could take it out, but this might be my only chance at Hauser.Ive got him right in my sights.I pull the trigger.My blaster doesnt fire.I keep pulling the trigger and nothings happening.My blasters got no charge left.In fact, it doesnt even have an energy clip.Someone must have ...Hauser ...Hes already blasted the second mutation when I hear the thirds death cry.It distracts me, and Hauser sees that I intended to gun him down and hes in the wind.I made my choice, and now, someone has paid for it.I wasnt there to protect her.The scav cowards crawl out of their hiding holes.They all want to get a good look.The harpoon is still lodged firmly in her back, and I cant remove it until Im sure how badly shes hurt.The rocky soil collects the blood leaking from the wound, and the puddle keeps growing larger.Samantha.The best I can do is roll her onto her side.I take her pulse and its weak, but I swear I can feel something.Youre fine, I say.Well get you patched up and ...Her eyes start to close.I yell Livias name.Shes knocking past the gawkers and fighting her way to me.She kneels beside me and lays her hands on Samanthas body.I hold Samanthas head in my lap.Blood leaks from her mouth to my hand.Shes growing colder.Livias hands wont stay still and I know somethings not right.She takes the harpoon out slowly and ...I can see Samanthas life leaking out.Livia gets her hands right in and shes trying to help, tears of frustration working up, but, Shes dead.I push her out of the way and lay my hands over the wound.There must be something I can do, some way to pull her back together.The only warmth I feel is her blood  Then Im crying.Out there for all to see.I dont care.Im crying and I dont try to stop.Livia wraps her arms around me from behind.I am so sorry, Lex, she whispers into my ear.No!Yes, she says.You have to let her go now.Samantha believed there was beauty here.She was wrong.There is only death.There is nothing worth saving.I bury my face in Livias cloak, sobbing like a child.She rocks me.We need ...to take the ...body, I blubber.I can feel the scavs approaching.I wont let them take more from her than theyve already got.We will, she says.We will do it together.Through my tears I see one, a small one, stroking Samanthas hair.Its the little girl with one arm.She pushes 374s hair back with her one hand.She cleans the blood from Samanthas lifeless face with a rag.There are others who gather around her body, seeing to her appearance.Children, all of them.One takes the cloak from his back and wraps it around her.These disfigured children see to her dignity in a way I didnt think possible.They all have genetic flaws.One is missing an eye.A ruby scar winds across the bridge of anothers nose to the side of her neck.There are misshapen teeth in their cracked mouths and one has a cleft palate.Freckles and birthmarks, more than I can count.In the Islands, this is all cosmetic work.But these guys never had access to that tech.They wouldnt have lasted a day in the Orphanage.In fact, they probably didnt.Maybe they were sent back here, just like Samantha.Maybe they never got to leave in the first place.The adults stay away, but the children keep coming to pay their respects.How many has she helped?The one with one arm takes my hand and strokes it with her soft little thumb.Dont worry, she tells me.Well take her somewhere she liked.A pretty place.Shell rest there forever and ever.She stares at me and her eyes are very clear and blue.Dont cry anymore.She wouldnt have wanted that, Lex.I look down, shocked.How did you know my name?Samantha told us you were coming.That youd be able to help us more than she could even hope to.39           Livia   The Safe Zone is deserted now, which makes our escape faster.Its still horribly unwelcoming, and we must watch out for more mutations.At the far border, the neon dies and the dark caverns hide evidence of old settlements and the old battles fought over them.There are still residents, but they dont emerge as we pass through.They live alone for reasons we dont need to question, and it should be left that way.Zavier moves quickly.I race to keep up, grabbing Lex and pulling hard, afraid we might lose him for good.Lex doesnt argue.Shes gone somewhere else.And I know, if I dont distract him, Zavier could leave us as well.Hes taking Samanthas death about as well as Lex.We cannot keep running.We have already lost Kane and Roscoe and the rest in our flight.Were left to hope for the best, but already I prepare for the worst.How did it become that way?I ask.Chemical contamination.Toxic waste.Where do you think Indra sends it?Every day more are corrupted and babies are born with defects.That mutation was probably just born that way, their broken genetics damaged long ago in their lineage.The way they fight, I almost feel they were here first.I can take you to see them if youre so concerned.But even Samantha didnt have the heart for that.Indra has clean burning fuel.Radioactive materials have been banned since the Great Catastrophe, I say.You can eat up all that make believe you like.Your air may be clean, but the core is getting hotter.The earths just dying from the inside now.That way, you cant see it as good from up in the air.Its time for you to stop thinking about yourself for once.I wasnt aware.So let me make you be more aware.Anything undesirable goes here.And the people who live here?They matter even less.And that, citizen of the great and honorable Indra, is the gift youve given us.His hate tires him out.Does that answer your question?Before I know it, Lex snatches Zavier up by his collar.What do you know, you arrogant, pompous ass?What do you know about my people?Or me, for that matter?I have never seen her this furious, and Lex, as I have come to realize, does not save her fury for special occasions.I know what youre capable of, he says, screaming right back.I know that you kill without batting an eyelash!In cold blood, yes, exactly as we were taught.We kill Emils and Alicias and Samanthas without regard.Exactly!he bellows.Finally!You admit it!Youd already blown his craft to pieces, but it wasnt enough.So you landed right there  Youre a maniac.In fact, stole one of our crafts, after youd already broken treaty in our territory.Your territory?!
