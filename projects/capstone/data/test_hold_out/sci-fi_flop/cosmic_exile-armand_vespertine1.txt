   Prologue      Nearly a hundred centuries had passed since he had last looked upon the stars.For the atrocities and abominations beyond count that he had done, he and all his people had been banished from the Universe itself, until either it or they were no more.He personally expected to outlive the Universe, but the thought of spending all eternity exiled from it tormented him more with each passing starless night.His race was trapped in a bubble of space time, which had been sundered from the rest of the Universe millennia ago.A transdimensional membrane of near infinitesimal breadth was all that kept him at bay.His little universe had only a single star, a pale white dwarf orbited by a slender black ring.That was the home of his people, where they had been spawned by the trillions.He was vermiform in body, and nearly five meters in length, covered in a jet black carapace that was broken into hundreds of segments.The front portion of his body was arched erect, standing well over two meters in height.His head was similar to that of a praying mantis, with a massive pair of almond shaped, iridescent blue eyes.His mouth was a squid like beak paired with a flickering serpents tongue.He had two pairs of arms, with the lower being smaller and more dexterous.Upon each hand, he had two fingers and an opposable thumb.Each digit bore a long, curved and glistening black talon.Every one of his lower body segments had a pair of strong, insectile legs to aid him in slithering.His ship was just as wretched.A perfect monstrosity made of living tissue.It was a mile and a half long, its thick crimson hide taut with blood vessels.In the aft were four long tusks, with a thin membrane webbed between them like a massive sail of skin.From within, the ship pulsed with the most insidious kind of life.Light came from bioluminescent patches lining the chambers and corridors.Gill like slits wheezed out foul smelling air.The doors were opaque membranes or convex shells.Large black hemispheres embedded into the walls served as video displays, and furnishings grew from the floor like warts and tumours.Staring out a window of biogenic crystal, he gazed upon the remnants of his once vast Armada.In days long gone by, he cavorted freely throughout the stars, ravaging entire worlds, raping them of all he desired.Soon though, those days would come again.His people would erupt from the Abyss, ravenous after their long deprivation, bringing annihilation to those who had imprisoned them so long ago.Soon, very soon, a ship would come along, and become ensnared in his little universe.There were many ways in, but this ship carried technology for bending space itself.Technology so powerful they could finally create a way out.He was Levanoch, Arch Lieutenant to the Grand Warlord Nakhash, Commander in Chief of the Scraumudi Armada.His liberation drew nearer, and once more entire worlds would parish at his command, entire races exterminated like vermin.He would spend all eternity making the Universe suffer for the ten millennia he had spent in exile.He had been punished as no living being had ever been punished before.They had taken the sky from him.One      The streamlined oval craft effortlessly sliced through the air, going a thousand kilometres an hour.It was held aloft not by wings, but levitated high above the ground using Casimir force fields.It piloted itself of course, soaring along flight paths meticulously designed to avoid collisions with birds.The craft was so cunningly designed that even in the unlikely event of a crash its occupants would be unharmed.Such were the everyday conveyances of the Pananthropic Republic.As the colossal spires of the Anthropolis receded over the horizon, the crafts occupants were treated to a view of an immense boreal forest that went on for as far as the eye could see in every direction.With most of the Human population concentrated in urban or suburban areas, and traditional agriculture obsolete, much of the planet was a lovingly shepherded nature reserve.Marc admired the view through the tinted canopy.He was seventy eight years old, but looked less than half that.Synthetic microbes in his body secreted (among other things) anti agathics, which rejuvenated his cells.Nanites in his bloodstream repaired cells and tissues, in addition to cleaning arteries and hunting down pathogens, cancer cells, and cells that had been infected by viruses.The keratin in his skin was as strong as spiders silk, and his bone tissue was similarly enhanced.Combined with germline modifications and regenerative medicine, Marc was essentially biologically immortal, and could expect to live for several centuries at least.He was completely typical in this regard.Marc had a lean and muscular body, just like almost every other man.He had medium brown skin and eyes, and his head was shaved bald.He had a kindly face with a bright smile, and he wore a light beard.Sitting next to him was his close friend and executive officer, Ilene Teskey.She was sixty three, but like Marc looked barely half that.She was unusually tall, 1.9 meters, as well as slender.She had sharp, angular cheek bones and bright green eyes.Her fair platinum blonde hair went down past her shoulders.He was dressed in a deep blue changshan style garment with silver embroidery, and she wore a dark gold, translucent tunic that went roughly halfway down her thighs and was girded by a silver belt.They were also both wearing neurolettes, as no one could be expected to function without one.Neurolettes took the form of elegant circlets worn upon the head, and provided three main functions.They allowed for a passive and non invasive neuro interface with any devices in their vicinity, recorded a continuous lifelog, and provided transcranial stimulation for a variety of applications.Sitting behind the two adults were a young couple who looked like teenagers, and were.They acted like it too, with their lips locked together and their limbs constantly groping each others nearly naked bodies.The girl was named Sophie, and was Ilenes legal daughter and Marcs god daughter.She had dark golden tan skin, brown eyes, and long, straight brown hair.Her young body already conformed to the feminine ideal of beauty; lithely slender with generous round breasts.Her lover, Brock, was likewise the masculine ideal of beauty.Humanitys love for these two ideals had kept them with binary gender, despite millennia of biotechnology.They each wore only a short sarong around their waists, proudly baring their perfected bodies.Sophie was perfectly safe dressed like this of course.Due to a multitude of reasons (intelligent panoptical surveillance, forensic forecasting, germline modifications, pharmaceutical moral enhancement and social engineering) violent crime was almost non existent, including sexual assault.Combined with ubiquitous beauty and weather control, clothing was usually optional.Sophies lust was not entirely due simply to her youth, however.She had a clear, transdermal patch on her arm which gave her a constant low dose of synthetic euphoriants and aphrodisiacs, keeping her perpetually happy and horny.Marcs mood however was somewhat different.As they neared their destination, he found he was becoming more and more nervous.Are you worried about seeing her again?Ilene asked.A little, Marc replied.Its been years since weve met in person.What are you two talking about?Sophie asked, gently pushing Brock aside.For the moment, her curiosity was stronger than her passion.Helena, Ilene replied.Sophie gave her mother a blank look.Should I know that name?she asked.Helena was a girl I met aboard the Caspian, around thirty three years ago, Marc replied.I was the head xeno anthropologist, and she was a junior member of my staff.We fell in love almost instantly, and we entered into an immensely enjoyable limerent marriage that lasted for the rest of our voyage.The Caspian was sent on a three year expedition to the Sunflower galaxy, and she was only half as fast as the Deity so it took three months to get there, and three months back.After we returned, Helena and I received different postings.We tried to get assigned to the same vessel of course, but it didnt work out.The only way the Astragnostic Society would be required to post us together is if we were really married, and she was only twenty four years old at the time.Wait, what?Sophie asked.Twenty four years old, thirty years ago?Thats almost twenty five years younger than you.At most, she would have been twenty one when you got together.You were sleeping with a kid Marc.Excuse me, youre not even as old now as she was then, and youve already had sex over three thousand times according to that disgusting little tally on your lifelog, Marc defended himself.With a guy my own age, Sophie enunciated.Marc, that is seriously creepy.Noted, Marc said indifferently.Creepy or not, we werent doing anything illegal.Since she was too young to get married  but old enough to fuck, Sophie said.Watch your tongue young lady, Ilene scolded.Since we couldnt get married, we had to split up, Marc continued.We kept in regular contact over the last thirty years, and had a few rendezvous when we could.Now though, shell be serving aboard the Deity as the head xeno anthropologist.And we already renewed our limerent marriage.You did what?Sophie asked.Are you telling me that youre now semi married to a girl you havent seen in person for years?We were happily semi married for over three years before.Were going to be together for at least a few years now, and if that works out then well actually get married, Marc replied.So, have you been holding out for this girl for the past thirty years?Sophie asked.Thats insane.If I even go a day without sex Im bouncing off the walls.What Helena and I had, and still have, is a very deep emotional and spiritual connection that has held up over thirty years, even when weve been millions of lightyears apart, Marc told her.Its much more important and meaningful than intercourse.Has she been celibate for the past thirty years too?If she hasnt, then thats kind of awkward, Sophie said.Marc sighed and placed his face in his palm.Sophie, how about you be quiet for a little while, okay?Ilene asked.Sophie rolled her eyes and ignored her.So are we meeting her at the shuttle station?she asked.Yes, and please be polite when I introduce you, Marc requested.In fact, Drkp is supposed to with her so be on your best behaviour.The Grey?Sophie asked.Please dont call him that, Marc sighed.They call themselves the Allura, and I dont think they mind being referred to as Reticulans, but absolutely do not call him a Grey.Hes God knows how many thousands of years old, and in that time hes become an expert at everything, including things no Humans ever even conceived of.His knowledge and abilities will be invaluable to us.Do not offend him, ever.If youre uncomfortable around him, just politely excuse yourself.But why he is with Helena?Sophie asked.Shes been on Amity Station for the past five years, Marc replied.Thats where they met.They struck up a rapport, so when Drkp learned of our expedition he volunteered his services.Helena is actually from the Anthropic Enclave, so shes very familiar with the Allura.Shes an Enclavean?Sophie asked.You mean, like a witch?Never use that word around her, Marc told her.She hates that.Shes just clairvoyant.Shes harmless.Just please, try to behave yourself around both of them.Sophie sighed and went back to her boyfriend.The remainder of the flight passed without conversation, and soon the shuttle station came into view.The flight craft sat itself down upon the landing platform and withdrew its canopy, allowing its passengers egress.Sophie rode upon her males back, as was customary.There was already a large crowd of people on the platform, waiting for the shuttle that would take them to the Deity.The arrival of their new commanding officer went unnoticed however, since they were all watching Drkp demonstrate his telekinetic abilities.Once thought to be mythical and still considered legendary, the Allura were a mysterious race.Through chance, convergent evolution, and possibly providence, they were uncannily Human.They had emaciated Humanoid bodies with large heads like upside down eggs.They had no pinna, only ear holes, no noses, just nostrils, and small mouths.Their eyes were theyre most noticeable and infamous feature; large, almond shaped, slanted and pitch black.They had no nails upon any of their fingers or toes.They possessed psychic powers Human beings once thought were impossible, and still could not explain.Despite their frail bodies, they often managed to survive for thousands of years.Their origins were unknown.Some said that they were what Humans had evolved into in the distant future, and had traveled back in time to colonize the past.Some said that they were the result of an alien race experimenting on primeval Humans.Others said that they came from half the Universe away.Those who believed that the Universe was a simulation often thought that the Allura were the avatars of beings from a higher reality.The Allura themselves enjoyed being cryptic and enigmatic, and never gave concrete answers to any questions about their nature or origins.Drkp himself was one of the taller Allurans, standing at about 1.7 meters tall.He was dressed in gold and purple robes and carried a moon white stave that held a violet crystal orb.Whether this actually aided his psychic abilities, or was merely for show, no one could say.The audience was throwing random objects at him, which he never failed to catch with his telekinesis, even when he wasnt looking.He directed these objects in an aerial ballet over their heads.All eyes were on his performance, except for Marcs.His eyes immediately fell upon Helena.Helena had marble white skin contrasted against bouncy, jet black hair that went nearly halfway down her back.She had crystal clear eyes like pale sapphires and pale pink lips.She was dressed in a tunic like Ilenes except it was midnight blue and inlaid with tiny diamonds that resembled stars.Marc was perhaps ten meters away from her when she sensed his presence.She spun around and her face lit up at the sight of him.She gleefully ran to him and threw her arms around him, kissing him longingly.He passionately returned her embrace, lifting her off the ground and spinning her in the air.When he set her down they smiled at each other.Hi, she said elatedly.Marc chortled.Hi, he said in kind.This is so amazing!I cant believe after all this time we finally get to serve on the same ship again, Helena said.Congratulations on being elected to Command.I voted for you by the way.If theres anything more impressive than being an astronaut, its being an astronaut Captain.Its an amazing privilege, yes, Marc nodded.But not as amazing as being with you again.She smiled at him and gave him a gentle kiss.Do you want to introduce me to your friends here?Helena asked.Of course.Helena, this is the Deitys XO Ilene Teskey.Blades, this is our head of xeno anthropology, Helena Delansy, Marc introduced them.This is Sophie, Ilenes daughter and my goddaughter.Hello, Helena said, shaking their wrists.Wow.You are literally white, Sophie commented.Sophie!Ilene scolded.Im sorry, its just very striking, Sophie said.You look nice though.Its very gothic.Thank you, Helena said, trying her best to be polite.Marcs told me a lot about you two.Ive heard a lot about you too; all of it delusionally idyllic, Ilene replied.Hes never told me anything about you, Sophie complained.When you were younger, I didnt think it was appropriate to talk to you about my romantic life, Marc explained.And for the past few years youve been a little distracted.And who is the young gentleman?Helena asked.This is my playmate Brock, Sophie replied.Isnt he gorgeous?I am physically addicted to this boy, and he has no refractory period so he can last for as long as I can take it.Sophie, why do you always have to talk about sex?Ilene asked, embarrassed.Because its all I think about, Sophie replied.Ilene couldnt help but scoff.Sure, now youre a nympho, but when we first told you about sex you swore you would never do it, she reminded her.Sophie rolled her eyes.I was little.I thought it would be noxious, but its not.Its the greatest ecstasy Ive ever known, so why shouldnt I do it as much as possible?Because there are other things to do Sophie, Marc replied.Less ecstatic maybe, but more meaningful.Ill decide what gives my life meaning, not you, Sophie told him.She squeezed Brocks torso with her legs, letting him know she wanted him to carry her away from her guardians.In her defense, shes not wrong.Helena claimed.If she wants to spend her life screwing like a bunny, thats her business.She takes after her mother, Ilene told her.Chika literally does nothing but lie around blissed out on euphoriants, waiting for me to make love to her.Shes the perfect wife, but I had hoped my daughter would want more than a Huxleyian life.If all you do is feel, when do you have time to think?Thats kind of a barbaric attitude, isnt it?Helena asked.You dont have to do anything to justify your existence.If your daughter wants to spend her life in a state of semi constant orgasm, thats her right.No offense, but I do not have to debate my daughters life choices with a complete stranger.Excuse me, Ilene said, taking her leave.The crowd around them burst into thunderous applause as Drkp finished his performance.Im sorry, Helena apologized to Marc after the noise died down.Did I touch a nerve?It has been a bit of a contentious issue lately, Marc replied.Sophies life right now is mostly divided between sex and rest.Ilene and I think her life would be more fulfilling if she had more diverse interests.I would like it if she valued knowledge over pleasure and went to study at a University or something.Her boyfriend at least plays sports.She could take up a job, or a hobby.Arent those really the same thing?Helena asked.Well, I think a job you have some sort of formal commitment to, Marc replied.There are consequences for not doing a job.What about my sister?Helena asked.Shes a musician.If she stopped playing and writing music then a lot of her fans would be upset.Does that count as a job?I remember when a job was something a Human had to do in order to survive, Drkp joined the conversation, walking up from behind them.But thats obviously an obsolete definition.My apologies, I didnt mean to eavesdrop.Dont be absurd.Its an honour just to speak to you sir, Marc said, extending his hand.Im Marcus Spencer, Captain of the Deity.Yes, Ive seen your picture, Drkp said, shaking Marcs wrist.On behalf of my entire crew, I would like to express my deep and sincere appreciation for you accompanying us on our voyage, Marc replied.Its a delight Captain, Drkp said.Ive tagged along on many Human expeditions into Astra Incognita.Its always a wonderful adventure.Im sure that was because of you, Helena said.If it wasnt for you, many of those adventures would have come to a tragic end.If it wasnt for me I doubt the Astragnostic Society would even exist.Youd be isolationists like every other starfaring civilization in the galaxy, too afraid of what lay outside your sanitized utopia to ever leave it.Youre very lucky you have me to stimulate your spirit of adventure.The Universe is too amazing not to explore it.They respectfully listened as Drkp continued to pontificate on how remarkable and indispensable he was until their shuttle finally arrived to ferry them to the Deity.***      Floating in orbit above the Earth was an impossible thing.Of all Humanitys technology that was indistinguishable from magic, it was the crowning achievement of their technomancy.It was a starship; a starship that could travel faster than light.Its jet black hull was a thick shell of invictus, an invincible metamaterial forged using a crude form of femtotechnology.It was impervious to radiation, especially Cosmic and Hawking radiation.It could survive collisions with space debris at relativistic speeds and not take a scratch.It was a miraculous material that protected the fragile Human adventurers from the cruelness of space.It even came in a semi transparent variety, allowing the ship to have windows.Humanity had mastered gravity just as they had mastered electromagnetism.The ship could shield itself from the gravitational pull of celestial bodies, and generate artificial gravity to prevent the crews bodies from atrophying.Most astonishingly of all, the ship could bend the fabric of space itself.Centuries of independent scientific advancement, as well as reverse engineering the vessels of more advanced and ancient races, had granted Humanity the coveted knowledge of hyperluminal travel.Old theories were refined, corrected and discredited.Quantum Gravity had to be rewritten when it was shown that FTL travel did not result in time travel, and new secrets of the Universe that none had dreamed of before were revealed.It was with this god like knowledge of the Universe with which fields could be created that perturbed the fabric of space in the most optimal manner possible.The ship projected fields that contracted the space in front of it and expanded the space behind it.The ship itself rode in an oscillating bubble of normal space.This gravity bubble was prevented from collapsing in on itself with the negative energy of Casimir force fields, and steered using the ingenious exploitation of quantum effects.This highly unstable ballet of forces was maintained by the constant analyse, calculation and direction from the ships computronium core.The tidal forces at the edges of the gravity bubble were so great that they atomized anything that passed through it.At hyperluminal speeds this generated Hawking radiation.The design of the gravity bubble allowed for this radiation to be dissipated outwards harmlessly into the void of interstellar space, instead of concentrating to fatal levels within the bubble.This same method was used to prevent the accumulation of energy from anything that got swept up in the gravity bubble, preventing a catastrophic outburst of energy upon deceleration.Or at least, that was how the layman generally understood the concept.The hyperluminal drive was a product of Humanitys collective knowledge, and it was said that no one individual could truly comprehend how it worked.Most people just accepted that and didnt question it.The Deity herself was a little over half a kilometer long, a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters tall.The ships walls gently sloped outwards from the rounded bow for half the ships length, curved in an hour glass shape for the penultimate quarter, and then formed a rounded stern.Halfway up the draft was a pair of arms that reached forward from the stern for about three quarters of the ships length.These arms contained various field coils, sensor arrays, radiators, ramscoops, and other essential equipment.Each arm also had three pairs of Q Vac (quantum vacuum) thrusters.The front and back pair were mounted on a dais that could rotate three hundred and sixty degrees, whereas the middle pair were lateral thrusters that pushed the ship sideways.The Deity could manipulate her own inertia, allowing her to rapidly accelerate using relatively little energy, and decelerate simply by returning her inertia to normal.The Deity possessed four hangars for auxiliary craft, all of which were located in the aft.Only the top hangar was open, its wide entrance covered by a plasma window.The window was strong enough to keep the atmosphere in, but weak enough to allow solid objects through.As soon as the shuttle was through the window, the hangar doors slid shut.Upon landing the shuttle was immediately surrounded by a flock of jellybots.Jellybots were the workhorses of Anthropic civilization.Their bodies were lucent, bulbous discs that constantly changed colour.They had six slender, retractable tentacles for manipulating objects, and could wirelessly interface with electronics.They levitated almost continuously, and moved by swimming through the air.They varied in size depending on their intended function, but most of them were small enough that Human beings wouldnt find them threatening.They were smart enough to do whatever grunt work they were programmed for, but intentionally limited to sub human general intelligence.More importantly, they were not sentient.They had no conscious will to challenge that of their masters.They never resented their tasks or questioned their servitude.They were the perfect soulless slaves who always did as they were told.Odd as they were, people found them less creepy than Human looking robots.Some of the jellybots unloaded the shuttles cargo, while others began performing routine maintenance and repairs.The Human passengers hardly paid any mind to the surreal flying jellyfish around them as they departed.Captain Spencer!
