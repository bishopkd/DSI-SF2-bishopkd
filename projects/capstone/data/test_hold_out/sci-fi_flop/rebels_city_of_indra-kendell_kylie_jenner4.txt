I want something better.I look away from him and he knows hes gone too far.I can hear his heart pick up in his chest and hes pushing off more body heat than before, so much it makes me feel uncomfortable.If that wasnt a simulation blaster, maybe Id take you a little more seriously, he says.I always take you seriously.He laughs and it breaks the tension.I cant stay angry.I break, too.My body is suddenly pulsing with energy.The boosters, I think.The idea of real missions.Making those Rock Bottom scrubbers bow before the force of our superior firepower.You really hate them, dont you?says Kane.Like he can hear my thoughts.Sometimes I wonder if he actually can.I mean, Ive never met anyone from Rock Bottom.Its hard to hate someone youve never met.Not that hard, I say.A memory plays in my head: an empty cot being sprayed with antisepticizer.All thats left is a number: 374.They sent 374 back where they found her, back to Rock Bottom.Ill bet those core low dirtmongers decimated her within seconds of her arrival.I hate the Rock Bottom.I hate every monster in that place.I want to destroy them with every fiber of my being.Ive never told Kane about Samantha or the Orphanage and the kids left outside the gates for the mutants.He doesnt talk about his home island, or clear up the gossip that his fathers a recluse and his mother long dead.There are some things you dont need to talk about.Somehow we both kind of know the truths already.I know his face so well.In the first year, when I felt like a shadow person roaming the Academy halls, Id see it and his crazy grin would pull me into existence.That same face stares at me now, unsmiling and just a little less boyish.That face I know as well as my own, inches away, our eyes level.Ill never see you again, he says softly.Ill be doing security in the Hub.Maybe in the City of Indra.And you ...theyll put you somewhere important, I know it.Doing something hidden.Secret.And I dont know when and if well ever see each other again.No, I say.Not like that, just like we promised.Well see each other, Kane.Weve gone over this.I know, he says.I would never forget that.I just meant  Two weeks after the Final Simulation, I say, cutting him off.Ill tell you again.Ill tell you until you cant think of anything else.We meet in the Archives in the memory of your eighth birthday.On your estate, behind your grand obelisk.Youll remember, right?Of course.Eight years old.My birthday.Estate.But what if you forget?How could I?No, he says, his face serious.Me.His expression makes me feel strange.Yeah, I say.I wish.He doesnt laugh and neither do I.  Our eyes lock.Then I want to do something crazy.Something I couldve never imagined wanting.I want Kane to kiss me.Or for me to lean over and kiss him.Either or both or whichever comes first.Lex, dont be crazy.I turn away quickly, my pulse racing like a speeder.I pull myself to sitting, my face flushed and tingling.Boosters.Its got to be the boosters.Well be late for rations, I say.Kane has turned back to face the ceiling.He stares into the sculptures spiked eyes.If you say so, he says.I dont look at him.Im afraid Ill see it again.That flash across his face.Get up, Cadet!I say, trying to sound normal.I give him a kick in the ribs.Not hard enough to really hurt.Okay, killer.I hear you.I immediately erase everything that just happened.I have to focus on what matters: the Final Simulation.Still, Im sure I saw it.That split second, his expression was unmistakable.He wanted the same thing.He wanted to kiss me.I give the ceiling a push and the fluorescent light irritates my boosted senses.I hoist myself up first.I look back at Kane, still in the Center of Creation below.I reach out my hand, and he takes it.Remember: eighth birthday.Behind the grand obelisk.You know Ill be there, he says, and I pull him into the real world.9           Countdown to Emergence Ball: 1 Week   Livia   I can barely walk.I limp a few steps, Marius watching pityingly.Ah, the cincher, I daresay, she says.Not the most appealing of lessons.My heavy sigh serves as answer enough.I long ago ceased my fibs of successful lesson completions and Etiquette Tutors accolades.The day I stood on a platform sixty feet in the sky, to be precise.I dont understand the necessity, I say.And you are not meant to, my love.Have all these years taught you nothing?What it feels like to be despised, I think.What it feels like to have an enemy.Perhaps, I say.Well, it will be of no concern where we are headed.Let us enjoy some time together.Marius and I are in the living quarters on Helix, surrounded by white walls.I wear my white evening gown, reclining vertically across the white reposer.The only pigment is the synth dirt stained soles of my feet.There was no time to groom before Etiquette, not that I would have.Etiquette Tutor cannot see through shoes, after all.Marius pretends not to notice, though.Having also been trained by Etiquette Tutor, she is well versed in Portrayal of Obliviousness upon Encountering Unpleasantness.I wonder if Etiquette Tutor will ever retire.I doubt it.She clearly relishes the power too much.Shall we?she asks.I nod, tap my wrist, and press my thumb to my pulse.Then Marius reaches over, inserting the access chip into my wrist with a satisfying click.Take me anywhere that is very far from here, I tell her.I lean back and gaze upward.Within moments, the white ceiling has gone black.The darkness is broken by a pinprick of light spreading outward, seeping brightness across my vision.When I gather my bearings, I can see were in an enormous domed room embellished with gold.There are fragments of melody, and I discover the source below, men with strange instruments plucking out uneven notes.They are tuning them, Marius says.I turn, and shes watching me, smiling at my wonderment.We are at the theater.But why?For pure enjoyment.The viewers wish to be, I suppose, taken to a place they have never seen.This part I understand.Rather popular charade, this one, she adds, gazing downward.Below us, the patrons are seated and waiting.The men wear strange uniforms and long coats; the women are an eternity of sparkling beads and plumed feathers.They whisper behind their hands, faces disappearing behind sleeves bloated to gigantic puffed orbs.This is Russia, Marius says.A place that is very cold and dark.So chilling, in fact, the citizens must ingest medicine to avoid freezingvodka.We are seated high above the others in an area reserved for those worthy of notice.Box seats, Marius calls them.Part of me yearns to be below with the others, close enough to smell their perfume, hear the silk of their dresses rustle.Perhaps I am destined to always be in the air, even within an Archive; fated to eternal isolation on varying makes of island.The theater lights fade around us.Is it over?I ask helplessly.It has just begun, says Marius, the music rising.Despite my dislike of Waslo, for two things I am grateful: his extended Archive access and Marius herself.Marius need not be relegated to dusty archival ruins with tedious images scrawled on the ceiling.Because of Waslos stature, shes allowed into historic re creations unavailable to the average Indrithian citizen.Locations created for only the most high level scholars and meant to entertain Indrithians of the Utmost Importance.And on occasion, she will take me with her.Marius has shown me Archives I never imagined possible.Places deemed too provocative for the average citizen.A hub of flashing lights, the technology rudimentary.Yet the citizens find the site so overwhelming they are forced to halt midstep and stare upward.She pointed out the ancient form of holo imaging spanning across the buildings of Times Square.A frenzy of distractions: food products and electric smiling faces and garish fashions.An early hololettering runs across the whole disconcerting collage.This is where they exhibit and honor those societal artifacts they deem most meaningful.I have seen a jungle, where the growing things are more powerful than the people.I have slid across ice caps, seen a mountain explode and bleed fire.We have watched figures travel the desert upon strange, long necked creatures.I have seen things that startled me, images so odd I could hardly believe they existed.Why can others not see them?I asked.They are saved for those believed worthy, Marius said, smiling as though I was one of them.Shes mistaken, I thought, listing various failures in my head: the girls who abhorred me, failed etiquette lessons, stains and dirty soles and Mica.I would never argue, of course.I needed these excursions, even if they were just simulations.I had come to like these fabricated worlds better than my real one.Yet never as much as this one.I want the ballet to last forever.Onstage, the women prance like Veda.They stand on the very ends of their toes, their chins lifted high, and spin in dizzying circles.They are strong, their muscles lean and hard, yet they move weightlessly, unrestrained as the clouds around Helix.They are beautiful, are they not?says Marius.I nod, watching through the crude magnifying device.I can only imagine what their skill with a zinger could be.The music intensifies, the dancers moving faster, seeming to barely skim the ground.Marius, her voice low and gentle, tells me the story as I watch.And now it is the princesss birthday.She is blissful, you see?The princess dances across the stage on her pointed toes, elated.A crowd gathers to observe, the king and queen and their many Middlers, all infected by her happiness and smiling.Shes about your age.Young and beautiful and holding the world in her palm.And this is her special day, just as your Emergence Ball will be.Those two words suck the happy right out of me.Marius must see the change, so she rests her soft, small hand over mine.You have no idea, my love, of your own power.I have no power.Just look at her, Livia.Beloved and worshipped by all.I watch as the princess dances on air, a skill not taught in the Islands.There are so many things I do not know and will never learn.The princess is sweet and gracious, just as you will be at your ball.And observe those watching.They are transfixed by her.See the faces of the men?They cannot look away.The Proper Young Men will do the same for you, my dear.And shes not even wearing a cincher, I state.Touch.But do not underestimate the power of having the right man beside you.Pick the right cohabitant, and you can have everything.Not just an island, my love, but power far beyond any you could ever imagine.Marius has never spoken in this manner, the urgency in her voice making me uneasy.I do not wish for a man beside me, I want to tell her, be him the right or wrong one.And what use is power when it comes with designated borders?Onstage, the princess spins in circles.Its not what you sacrifice, Marius says, but what you gain.And you, my love, can gain everything.Marius leans back, gazing toward the stage.The princess leaps, her body lithe and strong.For a moment, she appears to hover, body suspended in space.I know she must come down.That kind of happiness cannot last.A bit later, I find my assertion to be correct.A disfigured sorceress arrives to cast evil spells.The princess ends her birth celebration lifeless, sprawled prettily across the castle floor.She will remain in this state for a hundred years, until a cohabitant arrives to wake her with a kiss, Marius whispers.Rescuing her from the cage of eternal darkness.Reliance on Others to Affirm Our Femininity, I think.Etiquette Tutor would approve.The pantomime ends.The lights lift and the bodies rise from their seats.The men replace their hats, the women adjust their trains.They chat while exiting, the crowd growing thinner by the moment.The ending has come far too soon.I wish to stay here forever, I tell Marius.You silly thing.Eventually, you would be flung.And besides, who wishes to live in an Archive?Perhaps they havent seen this one, I say.I turn to her, suddenly frantic.One more place, Marius.Please.Take me anywhere, I dont care where.I cant return to Helix, not just yet.Marius raises her eyebrow.She sighs, smiles, and reaches for my access chip.Ocean is far grander than Life Guide had described.I dont fear the edge of the cliff, or the waves that break upon its rocky base hundreds of feet below.All I can do is stare and get lost and wonder where it begins and where it ends.How does a mass of such vastness simply vanish?I ask.The Great Catastrophe, Marius says as I remove my slippers.She sees me do this, and with a girlish smile that signals a secret that must be kept between us, she does the same.The earth is soft and wet under my bare feet, the sun a ball of fire setting in the distance, casting its orange gold across the waters glistening surface.They are perfect cohabitants, the sun and the sea.Ocean hasnt existed for centuries, Marius says.Before the Great Catastrophe, nature could not be controlled.Nature could hurt you, for it was violent and untamed, just as we once were as well.Now the sun is harvested, rain collected, and wind harnessed for proper use.It all occurs far above the highest island in the Aero Crown.If Indra were a living being, the Aero Crown would be the heart.The blood it pumps gives power and light.But it is a machine.Its power cant match that of the sun or the ocean.The grand fountain atop the Independent High Council, a wonder only Indrithians of the Utmost Importance are privileged enough to see, would be but a drop in this ocean.I try to mentally record this moment high up on the cliff, knowing that, most likely, this will be the last of my Archive adventures with Marius.Proper Cohabitated Women have obligations.They dont play with zingers, and they dont muck about in Archives.These activities are not considered Proper and they certainty dont serve the Greater Indrithian Good.As soon as I understood Mother was an idea greater than an air harp, I had come to wish Marius was mine.Then we could visit Archives, even after I had cohabitated, and few would dare question.But Marius isnt my mother, couldnt be even if she wanted.According to The Book of Indra, A solitary offspring is permitted per Cohabitated Unit, and that child must originate from said Cohabited Units genetic resources.Etiquette Tutor forced us to memorize this section.And then there is the unspoken secret: Marius already has a child.I have overheard the gossip since I was young, though Waslo and Marius have never confirmed it.Perhaps a genetic mutation, I concludea child even smaller than Mariusthey have chosen to conceal for fear of public ridicule.In a strange way, Im jealous of her.Or him.Perhaps we could have been good friends.Its not so bad, says Marius suddenly.Cohabitation.Her voice ricochets across the water, then surprisingly returns to her.Perhaps you will fancy one of the Young Men.Perhaps I will find my own Waslo, I say, imagining no fate worse.She laughs, a tinkling sound.You will do better, she says.I turn to her, eyes wide.Do not appear so greatly shocked, Livia.You are a smart young woman.You must know that Waslo has given me a great deal, elevated me to an enviable status.Of course, due in large part to my own guidance of him, but that is beside the point.Do you love him?I say, the words slipping out before I realize whats been said.In a manner of speaking, I suppose.I respect him.I applaud his success.I bask in the light of his accolades.That is love enough for me.She sighs.I love him for choosing me.I was lucky to find anyone at all.I nod, understanding.She looks off into the ocean.Waslo saw something no one else was capable of seeing.You are little on the outside, he told me.But inside you tower over the others.He let me be strong.In fact, he welcomed the strength.Marius turns to me.Ive never seen her expression so fierce.He worshipped your father, of course.Would have followed Armand to the ends of Indra and beyond.Your father was a brilliant man, and Waslo was devastated when ...She shakes her head.When it was over.Please keep going, I think.Tell me.What happened to my mother and father?I dont say that of course, for I already know her response.The same I have been given for as long as I remember.You will be a Citizen of Importance, my dear.Just like Waslo.Just like your father before you.After you cohabitate, you will carry out his legacy.Genetics?Unlikely, since Life Guide refuses to impart this knowledge.Perhaps if I had access to my fathers research ...Is that what you want?Truly?I nod.I feel I want his research more than anything.Its my birthright.Im sorry, my dear, but I was told that disappeared when your father ...Suddenly, she grows pained.Perhaps the High Council recovered it.Waslo could speak with them.Perhaps.We have petitioned for anything they may have found, but all we hear back are empty promises.Remember, youll be a woman soon, and now is the time to wipe the slate clean.Her mood shifts more drastically than I expect, and its clear what the loss of my fathers friendship meant to her.Im being silly, she says, brushing hair from my face.Im spoiling our time together.No, I say, trying to hide how crushed I feel inside.There was a great deal of power in knowledge, your fathers knowledge especially.He was ...visionary.Marius reaches out, takes my hand in her own.But you ...you are his finest creation.Now we are facing each other.Even the ocean is overwhelmed by the privacy of our council.Promise me one thing, she says, staring into my eyes, distracted by what she sees there for a second.How my eyes do not match.We have done this before, I think, remembering suddenly.The first day of Socialization Club, when I worried your collar might choke you.Only then I was looking up at Marius, and now I must look downward.I nod, just as I had then.You must be the ideal Proper Young Woman at your ball.For Waslo.For me.Because we owe it ...to the memory of your father.And to the citizens of Indra.At that moment, I understand: she may love me, but that is beside the point.Above all else, I am her duty.The obligation she has spent my lifetime fulfilling.It is almost freeing, the sudden knowledge: Im completely alone in the world, even more so than I imagined.I promise, I tell her, and she smiles as the sun is replaced by the moon.I stare into the horizon, the reflections of long extinct stars shining off the long evaporated ocean water.That is when I sense the desperation.Someone is watching, I think, turning quickly.Just fast enough to glimpse a black cloaked figure, hood pulled low, eyes peering out from beneath, glimmering and alive.Shadow people have dead eyes, I think.Or so we have been taught.Marius follows my gaze.Splendid, Livia!she says quickly.I knew you would understand.She pulls out my access chip and everything disappears.Excerpted from The Population Control Forces Academy Cadet Holo Handbook,  45, Section 8      FINAL SIMULATION   Immediately following completion of Final Simulation, Cadet will appear before Population Control Forces Panel for performance assessment.At that time, Cadet will receive orders of their placement within the PCF.Immediately following placement orders, Cadet is granted twenty four hours in which to collect belongings, clear out pod, and report for active duty.As ordered by the Independent High Council, Cadets placements are permanent.Cadets have been carefully chosen, and PCF placement is nonnegotiable.As a PCF Cadet, you have been carefully chosen and rigorously trained for one purpose: protecting our Great Indrithian Society.This is the greatest honor of all.10           Final Simulation Exam   Lex   Im ready to kick dustball ass.Now I just need the signal.My black mission suit gleams, the silitex molding to my curves like a second skin.Ive secured my body plates, pulled the straps extra snug.My new blaster, the Dust2Dust Model 750 they hand out before exams, is packed with four hundred charges.I straddle my air speeder, the engine humming beneath me.Kane straddles his ride beside me, grinning in that way he has, upper lip curling like nothing matters.Like this exam wont determine our entire forsaken futures.I narrow my eyes at him.Hes still grinning.Hell do what he wants, always has.It makes me crazy.Its also the reason hes my best friend.Focus on yourself, mudgirl.I dont have to turn.I can picture Cassinas cold blue eyes staring through the security goggles.Her hair, so blond its almost white, is sheared at her chin like a helmet, with ends sharp enough to cut you.My hair is long, dark, and wild.The cadet groomer gave up on me years ago.Set his clippers down and said, Not much I can do here.If only Cassina had done the same thing.Too much mud in your ears?she says, her voice ringing clearly through my earfeed.Even above two dozen engines I can hear her say, You make me sick.Shes trying to psych me out, of course.I know how that airborne princess works.You bottom out here, theyll dump you back to the very bottom.Let the mudpeople eat you alive.But does anyone want you?Her voice plays at being hard.You just appeared one day.All alone in the world, no one giving a damn whether you lived or died.She laughs.Not much has changed, I suppose.I will smash your face in, I think for the first time today.Its not a new thing.Shes rabid because she doesnt have my focus.Shes a victim to her nerves.She throttles her air speeder at the head of the pack.Were all waiting for the green light.For our final exam, Cassinas leading this mission.Indra help us all!Indra has put miles between civilization as we know it and Rock Bottom.This is to ensure that only those who want to get there have the determination to traverse the tunnelways and suffer through the heat that builds the deeper you go.The silitex regulates our body temperatures, but it never feels completely comfortable.Cassina leads the pack, and the rest of us stay in formation as we bend around the turns and merge into the narrowing passage.One mile out and we go into silent running, cutting down our engine power to mask our approach.We cut our illuminators by 90 percent, but my eyes have no trouble with the darkness.The rest do their best to avoid sheer drops that go express to the core.The placement panel will examine our recorded biorhythms on our return.My adrenaline is off the charts.Like I said, you have to want to be down here.I do and I have much to prove.Cassina signals for a full stop.We hold in silence, awaiting her next order.Whats come so far was the easy part.Now we have to track down the scavenger leader and detain the locals.Kanes head is bopping up and down, as if hes saying, Come on already.Even now he keeps it light.Lex?Youll take point from here on in, Cassina says.I look at her.She mistakes it for confusion.That means youll be scouting the perimeter.I heard her the first time.There is silence on the earfeed.A one way.No return.A ride to failure.Thats what all the cadets are thinking.Clearing a room is dangerous enough.Clearing an entire mud cell is even worse.Being the first one in?Suicide.There are other options.Logical options.Send in a recon team for initial surveillance, disorient the enemy with a warning flash buster.But sending in a single cadet?We all know that is core low crazy.Its a setup.Of course I know that.Everyone does.Send me in, get me killed off.I know the others are waiting on the earfeed to hear my okay.My mind is racing.The fear is very real.I go in first, I think.Get demolished immediately.Cassina orders team to rush location, surprising already disoriented enemy and taking the mud cell out.Cassina leads us to victory.I fail.Theoretically, she could make this work.But it goes against everything weve been taught to value.The plan shows blatant disregard for her fellow cadets.For the people who have been trained to have her back.Thats about as core low as you get.Cassina hates me even more than I thought.She hates me enough to jeopardize her mission captain status.Of course.It isnt that big a risk.Not for her.Shell risk low results and still get a great placement.Either way, shell be fine.And chances are shes probably thinking everyone will remember the victory.Not the sacrifice that made it possible.Then I notice something.Im smiling.Okay, I say, breaking the awkward silence.I hear someone gasp.Order received, Mission Captain.Ill take out every single one of them.Every single dirt scavenger.By myself.Just me blasting my way through those dirtmongers.Im ready.Ive always been ready.And being alone?Thats nothing new.Okay, Cadet, says Cassina, uneasy.Maybe she thought I didnt have the guts.Maybe shes realizing the truth.Maybe Cassinas thinking: Wow, I really am evil.Most likely not.Cadet, she says, her voice strong again.Take defensive position and await the go  A voice buzzes in.No, it says.No, Cassina.Kane.Excuse me, Mission Captain, he says.What I mean ...Id like to volunteer to accompany Cadet Lex.Make it a two man clearing mission.Wait, I say.I can do it by my  Mission Captain?says Kane, his voice rising over mine.Do I have the go ahead?He called her out.Stepped up for a fellow cadet.In that moment, I know she hates Kane as much as she hates me.Fine, she hisses.Just get the job done.Rock and concrete.The smell of human waste.Leftover bits of humanity: a deflated zip ball, mounds of stinking, soiled clothing.Thick black mud bubbles up to our ankles.Some sort of rubbish dump.Or maybe this is just another day in Rock Bottom.Kane and I crouch behind a mound of scrap and wait for the signal.We left our air speeders outside the tunnel entrance and trekked down here on foot.My hand mutes the earfeed.What were you thinking?I spit.Calm down, he says, covering his own.Now well both get bad placements if you survive this.I dont care, he says.Do you understand?Ive never heard Kane like this.His intensity shuts me up quick.I dont care about my placement, Lex.Dont you get that?I never have.I could have gotten myself kicked out of the Academy long ago.Why didnt you?He doesnt say anything back.He doesnt have to.I can see the answer in his eyes.I dont need you, I want to say.I dont need anybody.The earfeed buzzes a mission update alert.You will infiltrate the headquarters and take recon.Other cadets, take positions bordering the area.Cadet Lex and Cadet Kane, we will await your signal.Understood?Absolutely, I say.Silence.Kane?says Cassina.Copy, he repeats, though his silence already said everything.Good.Then stabilize and await four count, says Cassina, having regained a measure of self delusional swagger.Kane and I stare at each other, both holding our breath.Four ...three ...Instantly, we rush for the target, our bodies hunched low in the dark.We stop, push up against a slab of rock.I check coordinates on my wrist monitor.Less than ten feet around this corner, I say.You ready?For anything, he says.Then he grins.The lip curls.Its exactly what I need.The power surges up through me.We sprint from cover and dont stop until we reach a tall building jutting out from the side of the tunnel.Its then I realize the tunnel is a wide boulevard.There are thousands of tracks trampled into the earth, all migrating here.Most of them are fresh.The building was white once, in the long, long ago, and the front steeples up.At the top hangs a large, rusty bell.If you rang it, it would probably fall and smash through to ground levelthats what condition this place is in.The dirt scavengers hide in this house of worship.Wooden shingles hang like broken teeth.Dust storms have torn gaping holes in the roof.What remains was blackened by fire.Just like a Rock Bottomer, I think.Taking something nice and sucking the beauty right out of it.Kane and I could sit here and let time solve our problem for us.One blast to the bell and it would fall, maybe destabilize the whole structure.Seal the scavs and their blasted leader inside.Thats when we hear the grating notes.Clanking and banging so loud I think my ears might split open.I freeze for a second.Are you okay?says Kane  Of course, I say as my blaster hums to full power.Kane has his at the ready, too, as we skirt the perimeter until we find a broken window along the side.I clear away the glass shards with the butt end of my blasterthe racket coming from inside so loud you couldnt hear a transporter landingthen sling my weapon back over my shoulder.I reach up, bracing myself on the edges of the opening.Wait, says Kane.I feel his hand on my back.Ill go first.I turn around.No way, I say.I have to go first, you know that.Thats the assignment.Im First Cadet.He nods but doesnt take away his hand.I look straight in his eyes.Im glad, though.That you came with me.Kane nods and boosts me up.I drop down into the pitch black.He lands beside me and we stay crouched on the sticky floor.I cant see anything, yells Kane.The musicif you could call it thatis louder.I feel my teeth vibrating.Should I turn on our beamers?No, I say.Itll give us away.Just follow me.And stay close.He rolls his eyes like he always does when he thinks Im being bossy.And dont make that face either.He almost grins.We scuttle along the ground, pushing through garbage and debris.My hands are coated in a thick, sticky fluid.I cut my leg on something sharp.Straight through my uniform.I see the blood rising through my silitex.I know the wound is deep.This must hurt, I think.All I feel is electricity running through my body.Kane tries to give Cassina information through his earfeed.Its useless.We cant even hear ourselves think, thats how loud it is.The clanging and grinding is overwhelming, inescapable.My temples throb.Kane grabs my foot.He means stop.I know him that well.I turn to look at him.Something is about to happen.I know thats what hes thinking.Be careful.Light bursts from the monstrous gaping hole in front of us, a fiery mouth blazing inches from our faces.Kane and I look at each other.His eyes are wild, his face lit up bright.I trust you more than anyone in the world, I think.And I hate that.That I need to depend on anyone.We rise to our feet at the same time, blasters aimed.Now or never.Together, we rush into the light.Its too much to take in all at once.I feel something snap in my brain.I circle the room with my eyes, trying to get my bearings, trying to keep my cool when everything I see is horrible and new.They never taught us about this.I wonder if Im going crazy.The screeching music is coming from the top of the huge cavern.An enormous pipe organ hangs from the ceiling, a man pummeling the keys like hes committing murder.Theyre all dancing.Horrible, disfigured bodies writhing together.If you totaled up all their missing limbs, you could probably build a dozen more of these scavs.An old man is speaking to a half naked woman.He opens his mouth wide, showing rotted teeth and half a blackened tongue.The woman is huge, her fat gathered in strange, uneven lumps on her body.She laughs at us through bright pink lips.Her laugh sounds more like a backfiring speeder.Someone passes a bottle to a man with a scarred face.He gulps it down, then smashes it on his companions head.Bright red blood squirts from the wound.No one takes notice except us.The scarred face erupts into cackles and moves on.Over his head sails a firebomb.A bare chested man with an exoskeleton mutation hunkers nearby, parts of his heavy bone structure outside instead of in.The firebomb breaks on his back.Instantly, hes on fire.He makes a hollow, shrieking sound and the flesh melts beneath his bones.Above, the man continues to play music.Below, everyone keeps dancing.Next to me, Kane tries to keep his breathing steady.I cant unsee this eitherthe true face of the scavs, the savagery of Rock Bottombut I can make it no longer exist.Which one is the leader, I couldnt begin to guess.If we are to survive, well probably have to take them all down.Then a loud moan echoes through the room.Loud enough to hear over the music.It doesnt seem human.Everything stops.Heads turn in our direction.Weve been spotted.Everyone is looking at us.The ones with no eyes stare through empty sockets.Then theyre coming.For us.All of them.All at once.Now, I say to Kane, our blasters already aimed.Our blasters are the loudest music of all.If that organist doesnt stop playing, Ill go mad.Kanes shooting at their feet, keeping them away, while I aim at the organ on the balcony.Its so patched together, the support struts are calling my name.Ill feel stupid if I dont do this, and probably die, too.You have to take advantage of every opportunity your environment affords.I blast the first strut and the rusty metal snaps.The organist plays a harsh cord as the balcony shifts, and that might be enough to bring it down, but Im not interested in half measures.I blast the other strut and it doesnt take but one second for the organs massive weight to bring it all down.Kane sees what Im doing and hes backpedaling with me.The organ tears a hole through the floor, and the sound of its destructionof colliding metal and rending and groaningis the best thing Ive heard so far.Except now the scavs not caught under the organ are running crazed out of their minds straight for us.I take out the closest one and the blast sends him flying through the cloud of devastation.For a second, I feel sick.Until I remember they arent human.Theyre Rock Bottom.And its them or its me.I hear a blast and an enormous man stops suddenly, so close his hot breath fogs my face shield.Hes covered in hair, even his face.The hair on his chest is smoking and smells like burned rations.His eyes roll backward, and the rest of his body follows.I turn.Kanes face is a mask of fury, his blaster fuming.He gives me a look.Careful, Lex!he says, just as two blistered arms wrap around his waist.They belong to a shriveled old lady.Shes strongonly survivors live long down herepulling him to the ground.Instantly, two men are on him, kicking and bellowing.Spittle launches from their mouths.Kane groans.A bodysuit and face shield can only protect him so much.I aim my blaster, but somethings got me by the arm.I spin, coming face to face with my attacker, only his is half a face.He screams and Kane screams, and my miscalculationmy appetite for destructionhas put my best friend at deaths door.I slam my head against his half face, and pus and blood smear against my face shield.His screams cut short by my blaster.The guys pummeling Kane are next to fall.Kane rolls over, pretty ragged, but manages to get on his feet with my help.I wont let go.Welcome to the Lower Levels, he mutters.The chaos Ive created has done something right.The scavs have turned on each other.They havent forgotten us either, but theyre willing to kill anything within reach to ...to ...I dont understand them.Any of this.Back to back, the weight of each other propping us up, Kane and I blast full force at everything in sight.We give it everything we got.As soon as one falls, another is coming.What do we do?I say.Mission Captain!We need backup!shouts Kane into the earfeed.We need backup!No answer.They wont come without the signal.Maybe the earfeed has been compromised.Or maybe theyre ignoring us.After the head butt to pus face, all I get is static in my ear.The room is roaring.My head throbs like it might explode.Then I get it.The sound paint!I scream.The what?I turn to him, still blasting.The blasters energy bar is flashing red.Im going to run out of a charge real soon.I flip open my face shield.Sound paint!I shout.Sound!Paint!His face lights up through the drying blood.He always carries some, even here.Even though were prohibited from carrying personal items.How he snuck it in past the instructors and the sensors, now thats a secret hed delight in not telling me.My blaster stops firing, and even spent, I can use it as a club.I crack a scav in the head, but another rips the dead blaster out of my hands.Kane hands his off in my gut, and I shield him and keep firing.Hope still lives in this hopeless place.The blaster is the only instrument Ive ever played, but Im sure its the most beautiful in all of Indra.I look over at Kane.Hes the same twelve year old I met, with the same face, aged some but more confident.I think hes even having fun.Hes always known how to do that.His arm is lifted high and he takes a deep breath before he starts spraying.Instantly, theres color.Not the colors of my laugh, no purples or blues.Not the swirling reds and amber on his Book of Indra, but colors Ive never seen.Colors I hope never to see again.The color of rot and decay.Infected yellows and festering greens.The first sound cloud rises.I hold my breath because the mixture of the sight and the smell is enough to make my eyes bleed.Fists freeze in midair, and finally, theres dumbfounded silence.I love this silence so much....At least until mayhem returns.It turns out even scavs get scared.Or maybe theyre screaming in excitement.Or just for the sake of screaming.Kane keeps spraying.The painting becomes more putrid and cancerous, a sickening feedback loop between artist and subject.No one knows whats happening.Theres no art down here.Nothing worth living for, so they devote themselves to destruction.We cant see in front of our faces, and the scavs are swiping their deformed hands and half limbs at the colors, bellowing in confusion and amazement.As the volume increases, new clouds erupt and spread.Kane is a craftsman.The room is thick with color.Cmon, says Kane, grabbing my hand.I blast a hole in the church wall and we charge through.We keep running, me leading the way because Kanes eyes havent adjusted to the darkness yet.We stop and Kane tries his earfeed.Mission Captain?says Kane Hello?Anyone copy?He looks at me.Forget this.We gotta go.Before the colors die out.I only have one canister.Theres hardly any left.Wait, I say.We didnt take out the leader.We cant go in there again.Not without backup.No!I say.We have to!He grabs my arm.Stop, Lex.Dont be an idiot.I shake him off.We have to finish the mission!We did our part!he screams in my face.We glare at each other.He wont back down and I wont either.Lucky for us, were in no position to make a choice.Standing behind us is the greasiest, nastiest scav birthed in the Bottom.His guts rumble and he belches.His face is almost all skull, his flesh having dissolved long before we brought thunder to his home.Hes got an illuminator attached to his left eye, which blinds us.Most of all, he smells like waste.Probably his own.Their leader, obviously.Gross.Oh great, says Kane.We couldnt just leave, huh?Why are you so core low stubborn?I open my mouth to argue.Shut up, says the dirtmonger, oozing foam from his rotting mouth, covered in dead mans sores.He reaches behind and pulls something from his back.A weapon, crudely constructed of cast off materials.A makeshift blaster that sparks with fused power cells.Im reaching for my borrowed blaster, but Kane is quicker.His arm is already lifted high.Scream, he says, just as the dirtmonger is pulling the trigger.I scream harder than Ive ever done anything in my life.My sound cloud is instant and overwhelming.The dirtmonger stumbles backward, and I blast him, right between his rotten eyes.He drops dead.At least he looks that way.We escape through flecks of my golden scream just as Cassina and the rest of the cadets finally storm in.My body jerks in the blinding light.Above me, the sooty sky fades to a white dome.My weapon fades with it, and so does my leg wound.The only thing real is me.I blink a few times and look down.My body is untouched.Even my fingernails are clean.It wasnt real.But it felt that way.I unstrap myself from my simulation capsule, and all my fellow cadets look as dazed as I do, even though they didnt see any real action.One by one, they stare at me.Their eyes are wide with surprise.No one says a word.Hey, Lex, says a voice.Everyone turns toward Vipsinia, so little she almost disappears in her capsule.You are so stratosphere, she says.Then Exdrilla, one of Cassinas most loyal followers, looks at us.Something in her eyes, maybe a sense of recognition that Kane and I did the unexpected.We succeeded.And yet, shes scared to recognize that.They all are.The dried blood from Kanes face is gone.Just plain old Kane, his combat uniform as spotless as mine.The nightmare world and the nightmare people of the Rock Bottom are only memories now, locked away in their electric Archive chips, at least until the next class takes their Final Simulation.I smile at Kane.I feel my face glowing.Pretty good for an orphan, huh?He smiles right back.Only he isnt glowing.Theres something underneath his smile.Something Ive never seen before.It scares me.Cassina remains in her simulation capsule, the look in her eyes distant and cold.We made her look good and still her pointy face is pulled tight.Cadets.The senior lieutenant booms through the speakerfeed.Congratulations.You have completed your Final Simulation.Report to Academy headquarters immediately to receive your placement.No one makes a noise.It no longer matters how we feel inside.We are cadets.We serve a higher purpose.Kane and I are last to exit the Simulation Room.I wish I could say something to him.Just a few words.But we cant speak.Placements await.Its a serious occasion, walking toward your future.The cadets stand tall.We walk in drill lines toward headquarters.I wonder if theyre all as nervous as I am.Paint me, I want to say to Kane.Just one more time.Paint me saying good bye.Cadet Kane, says an authoritative voice.Kane and I stop.I turn, Kane doesnt.He just stares ahead into nothing.Three Population Control Forces officers stand shoulder to shoulder.They arent part of the Academy.They wear the dark blue PCF uniforms, but there are no insignia patches.Weird.All members of the PCF wear patches to show rank, even the lowliest, floor scrubbing slabbers.Cadet, its time to go, says one of them.What is this?I say to Kane  Kanes shoulders slump, like somebody just lifted a weight off them.Can I say good bye?he says.Good bye?I say.The rest of the cadets are long gone.Its just Kane and me.And these officers, telling him its time to go.Go where?Fear rises up inside of me.Fear of whats about to happen.It catches me off guard.I dont do fear.Make it quick, says the lead officer.He and the other two dont move.Dont even look away.Whats going on?I say to Kane, out here in front of these strangers.Did you know this was going to happen?Lex, he says, accepting my anger.I couldnt tell you.I took an oath.I couldnt tell anyone.I got my placement already.What?I cant tell you more.Ive already been doing it for a while  Thats where youve been?Yes, he says.I wanted to tell you more than anything, but  Wrap it up, Cadet, says the lead officer.But well meet, right?he says.Meet as planned.Two weeks.Same as before.Kanes stares at me, so much left unfinished between us.But well meet.We will.I look into his eyes and wonder how much else hes hidden.What else he could say that would leave me as speechless as I am right now.What else he could do ...He reaches for me and pulls me in tightly and kisses me.My whole body blushes, and I kiss him back.I kiss him back.He steps away and salutes the officers.Kane, I say.Why did you?Over his shoulder he looks at me.Because I wanted my first kiss to be with someone I actually care about.Thats enough, the lead officer says.Kane faces the men, his expression suddenly hard.Agent Kane reporting for duty, sir, he says, never sounding more official.He sounds like a man, I think.Then he marches forward, and just like that, hes gone.An inability to follow orders.A blatant disregard for standard protocol.Habitual and premeditated departures during simulation training ...I have to stand before the Official Placement Panel and listen to Senior Lieutenant list my offenses while everyone glares at me.These are bad things hes saying.I know that.Im neither proud nor ashamed of my disobedience.Ive just proven that I cant be changed.This is me, and I will always be this way.As soon as hes stopped talking, Ill get my placement, and Ill accept it.Its not gonna be pretty.A lifetime filling out PCF forms for people who matter.Cleaning up after people who matter.Serving others who mean something more than I ever will.And all I can think about is Kane.Hes gone, and he knew it would end this way.All that said, graduate, youve shown remarkable skill today.Unexpected circumstances.Unique aptitude.Unprecedented ability ...Kane already knew his placement.This knowledge has led the committee to contemplate the possibility ...And he didnt tell me.Senior Lieutenant replaces my armband with a new red one.With training, you could be of great use to Special Operations ...Kane....of the Rock Bottom Patrol.Im finally headed to where I was always meant to be.11           Special Operations: Apprenticeship         Excerpted from The Book of Indra,  VIII: Indra: Protecting Our Great Society      THE POPULATION CONTROL FORCES ARMY: PROTECTORS AND SERVANTS OF INDRA   The elite soldiers that make up the Population Control Forces are painstakingly chosen through a process veiled in secrecy.These select individuals are trained at the Population Control Forces Academy.Once graduated, they will go on to some of the most important positions Indra has to offersome will serve as the leaders of the City of Indra, overseeing the safety of all Indrithians.Others will serve in intelligence and security roles, overseeing the Horizon Checkpoint.The most elusive and lethal members of this highly exclusive force will work in Special Operations in the lowest levels, also known as Rock Bottom.Lex   Two weeks and I havent been permitted to leave the Academy.This training is so specialized, Senior Lieutenant tells me, that youll do it here.When you are deemed adequately prepared, youll be relocated to your new base of operations.They dont even tell me where that will be.Im still on Academy grounds, only far away from the students.Even farther than where the instructors live.A place not even Kane and I knew existed.There hasnt been an Academy graduate placed in the Rock Bottom Patrol in almost ten years.It takes a couple days before all new training equipment arrives.My placement reflects well upon the instructors.Im even permitted to dine with them, if I choose.I dont.Still, I should feel honored.Rock Bottom Patrol is the elite.If I pass the apprenticeship, Ill be a Special Operative.SpecOp Lex.It sounds pretty good, but for some reason, Im not that excited.Moving on is harder than I supposed.I have a home pod.Just like my sleeper pod, only bigger.For the first time, food is brought to me.
