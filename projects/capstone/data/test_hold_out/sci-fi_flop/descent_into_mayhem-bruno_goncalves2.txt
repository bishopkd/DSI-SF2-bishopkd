Its enveloping hug spared him from the chilly winds worst bite, but still he continued to tremble.Baylen returned with dry clothing and duly initiated him into a stretching routine.As he followed the corporals instructions, Toni heard the armored Suit moving far below, occasionally sounding the war horn and that skin crawling roar that, according to Baylen, had once been recorded from a mountain lion and since become a permanent addition to the Hammerheads playlist.So thats a Hammerhead?Yes and no, Baylen answered as he helped him stretch his calves.Hammerhead is what Joe Public knows it as, and its also the nick we have for the walker.Its a Model 1 Tactical Armored Suit, and we call it the Hammerhead cause the operational ones got a head that looks like those sharks.You know the ones, right?Yes sir.Dont sir me, respect me, you hear?We call the Hammer down below Headless.I guess thats about the extent of our imagination.Its chassis and systems have seen better days, and though its OS is up to date, its hardware is not.Whats an OS?The corporal chuckled.Youll find out if you make it into Suit School, rook.Havent passed your medicals or the interview yet so dont get too cocky over today.All it takes is a bad non remediable gene, or maybe a bad interview, or maybe a screw up on base, and youll be working Logistics and Support by the end of the day.So forget about the questions for now and keep up your stretching, alright?These are the weirdest socks Ive ever seen ...Toni remarked as he inspected the footgear the corporal had brought with him.Baylen laughed.Those are moccasins, rook!Did you grow up on a farm, or something?Toni didnt answer, but his ears began to glow cherry red.Before long he understood the corporals concern for him getting cocky about today.By the time Toni, newly clad in a polar neck jersey, thick cotton trousers and the sock like pair of moccasins, had joined the crowd by the finish line, the horn had blown six times.Despite that fact, he was still the only recruit to have reached the end of the Click, although only moments ago he had seen a female recruit execute the Leap into the Unknown.She had jumped face first only to be bushwhacked by Headless, the padded sledgehammers slap against her flailing body carrying all the way up to Valhalla, where it met with the delight of its inhabitants.Outstanding, Headless.The brass up here are pegging you as their new cleanup hitter, the soldier beside Toni hollered into his radio, and he was answered from down below with the now familiar feline roar.Toni wondered what the other recruits were thinking as they heard that sound, suddenly relieved at having been the first to go.A voice squawked something out of the soldiers hand held radio that only he seemed to understand.Captain, Headless is saying the recruit fell off the net and cant get back on!Give her the two mike penalty and stop her time.Fifteen minutes, twenty and seven seconds, sir!log it, Hank.Whats her name?Sueli Cassel, code name Blusher, someone answered as she perused a clipboard.There were a few chuckles to that.Thats why I like Mason at Station One.He can pick up a candidates traits in a heart beat, the Captain remarked.He was a heavyset man in his forties, who sported a wide black goatee in contrast to his shaved skull.Taking a seat on one of the few wooden stools, he supported an elbow against the desk beside him and eyed Toni.And hes got enough asshole charm to get rid of the feebles before they get on my nerves.The captain had a pleasant enough voice, but Toni felt his hackles raise.There was an odd expression on the mans face as he read what was written on the recruits forehead.Sir?Devonports calling from station two.Says his nightscopes running out of juice.Thats cause our sergeants keeping the scope up even when no ones there.Tell him to use the ears the Gods graced him with and only punch it when he hears someone coming.The morning began to stretch out as the rain came and went, horns and roars and occasional raucous laughter filling the forest.The camp, suspended among the high trees by nets and cables, swayed in the occasional breeze.Most of the sergeants and officers present on Valhalla didnt appear to need to be there, and were regarding the Click as a kind of social event, complete with an improvised buffet table Toni didnt dare approach despite his growling stomach.The few soldiers actually at work were the captain, a female sergeant named Miriam Reeves, Corporal Baylen and the two soldiers manning the electronic equipment.The radio man, an agitated youth not much older than Toni, would receive news from his various sources on the ground and relay them to the officer.The news focused as much to the spirit with which the recruits were attacking the course as to their actual performance, and he found himself wondering what they had said about him.It was eleven oclock before Toni finally found himself again in the company of a fellow recruit.Her leap into the unknown was original.The recruit launched herself headfirst through the passageway at a steep descent, prompting the Hammerheads first miss of the day as she splattered into the churned mud below.Apparently unhurt, she jumped fitfully away from the Suit and, spotting the nano net above her, pounced upwards like a cat and gained a hold of its end.In that moment a second figure jumped through the wall, colliding against the armored Suits spaulder and somehow managing to grip onto its exposed artificial muscles.As the first to arrive finally clawed her way up onto the net, the second spotted her and launched himself onto it, colliding with the female recruit and almost sending her back down into the mud.The spectators cheers were drowned out by the armored Suits frustrated roars as both recruits embarked on their scrambling climb to Valhalla.The first to arrive was the girl, covered in mud but sporting an insane grin on her face as she scrambled onto the tiles.The male recruit, however, was the proud owner of a newly acquired gash spanning much of his forehead, exposing pale pink bone beneath.His crash helmet was missing.Valhalla Camps medical evacuation procedure proved to be terrifying in its conception.Once his laceration had been briefly disinfected and bandaged, the recruit was fitted with a parachute and flung cursorily over the side.The chute deployed by cable, and within seconds the casualty had touched down on the forest floor.Shortly afterwards, a second Hammerhead showed up, unceremoniously picked up the recruit, wrapped him in parachute silk and stomped away with the boy held in its arms like an infant.Toni began to wonder how they were going to leave Valhalla.When he asked the radio operator about it, however, the soldier laughed.Were going down the way you came up, chum, unless you brought a chute for yourself.Toni accompanied Baylen as he directed the remaining recruit to the camps rear.Pulling the awnings fringe back from the nano net it was suspended on, the corporal improvised a rainwater shower for her to wash off the mud.With chestnut hair but the oddest almond shaped aquamarine eyes, the recruit seemed unable to remove the grin from her face, and indeed he was unsurprised to find HAPPYFACE written on her forehead.The corporal treated her like a princess, keeping her company as he sent Toni to fetch dry clothing from a crate at the camps opposite end.By the time he returned it was clear why Baylen had done so.The corporal was no longer alone with the recruit, having been intruded upon by a very irritated Second Sergeant Reeves, who had apparently taken it upon her shoulders to protect Happyfaces innocence.Baylen was stiffly ordered to vacate the premises along with a bewildered Toni.Damn Sarge can read my mind ...Baylen chuckled as they rejoined the finish line attendants.Shortly before mid day the last recruit washed out in the river tunnel, no other having managed to find his way up to Valhalla.Captain, Spaz just cracked in the water pipe.Nona had to drag his ass out.He froze, sir.Strike his name from the log and close it.Baylen, get the boy into his provisionary uniform and out to the canteen.Its time to fill some bellies.Yes, captain, Baylen replied, remaining where he stood.They watched in silence as the camp slowly emptied, its former occupants launching themselves confidently onto the nano net one at a time, cart wheeling, rolling or slowly sliding down its extension in single file.If Toni hadnt already seen a sledge hammer wielding armored Suit ambush flying recruits, he would have considered that the strangest thing he had ever seen.Whats your name, boy?Baylen asked as he contemplated the descending group.Toni, sir.Dont sir me.Whats your last name?Miura.Ahuh.Never heard that name before.Where you from?A farm outside Leiben.My father works in livestock and forestry.And your mothers last name?Martial.Why?he asked inquisitively.Dont know any Martials here either.Been a soldier bout fifteen years now.Maybe not the brightest, but I still got a good memory for names and families.Dont know how the hell you managed to do the Click in your time, but you came in second best in forty six runners.The chick you finished ahead of is called Hannah Arakaki.Not a generation has gone by without at least one member of her family making officer rank.And the one who face kissed the suits called Ian Templeton.You know the name?Only the last one.Thats the only one you need to know.The Army isnt a popular institution any more but its still got a lot of power in the general scheme of things.Theres not a seat of power on Thaumantias that doesnt have a Templeton or sympathizer of sitting in it.If this kid makes it, hell be the third in MEWAC alone.And he finished the Click in a record time.Four minutes and seven seconds.Makes sense, considering theyre all transgen freaks.That family invests so much in gene therapy its hard to believe they still got more money than God.Arakaki, Tani, hell, most names with top results on the Click belong to families with their fingers and thumbs dipped in all that shit.Not mine.My father doesnt believe in it.Hes a natural.Only my mothers got transgens on her side.Rook, thats my point.You got lucky today.When they do the medical, theyre gonna look for the genes they think will fit the Suits.And theyre not gonna forget what families support military funding, I guarantee it.You must have had some ideas about what you wanted to do here, but its best you put the Suits out of your mind.Fifteen years ago, I finished well ahead of the curve in the Click here.Was a bit different then, but I still managed under nine mikes.You know what I do now?No.Foot infantry, Close Ground Support.Im the one with nano net camo in my pack and a Lacrau on my shoulder.If Im lucky, I can hitch a ride on a Hammerhead so it will park me up a tree to set up an observation post or a defensive position, and thats about as close as Ill ever get to being in one.Im saying this cause I just dont want you to go down to the canteen and mouth off about your time.Keep your eyes open, your trap shut, and hope for a miracle, cause thats about all you can do from now on.Got it?Yes ...And shut your mouth about your father being a natural.You wont be getting any points for that either, understood?Yes, Toni answered quietly.They stood silently for a while, watching as, far below, the radio operator carefully dropped his equipment into a soldiers waiting hands before jumping into the mud.A minute later they were truly alone.Toni finally turned to the corporal.Baylen, I know what you said about asking questions, but could you answer me a couple?Baylen smiled and nodded.Depends on what you ask, rook.What was my time?Eight minutes, seventeen seconds.Do you get it now?Yeah, I got it.Another question.What the hell did Mason write on my forehead?Baylen snapped his head towards Toni and watched him carefully.Then his lips cracked into a grin and he began to laugh loudly enough to disturb the wildlife.Ah hell, you rooks crack me up!You mean you havent even guessed by now?No.I just didnt like the way the captain looked at me, thats all, Toni replied.The grin dissipated from Baylens face.Rook, you gotta understand that some reputations can be hard to lose around here.Some guys fuck up on Day One and never get over it.And if First Sergeant Mother Fucker Mason wrote Mister Tardy on your forehead, its cause you broke one of the cardinal rules over here.You never, ever, make your betters wait for you.Understood.If thats the case, can we get going now?Toni asked.Thats the spirit, rook, Baylen said, giving Toni a heavy slap on his shoulder blade before launching himself out onto the nano net.THREE      200 kilometers above Capicua, 14H35, 14th of January, 2771      Tommi Kaiser Von Beulwitz was beginning to feel the gees stacking up, the Tactical Entry Capsule rocking slightly as it encountered denser atmosphere.For the first time regretful at executing the entry dry, he began to flex his forearms and abdomen as his suit tightened like a python around his legs.The following minutes wouldnt fare well if he blacked out.At the very least it would be an embarrassment.Kaiser wondered how Lippard was in that moment, and whether she was taking any pleasure in the suits tightening embrace.No, no, stop thinking about her, he scolded himself.This was definitely no time for an erection.Getting wood just as his suit was constricting his crotch was a bad way to go.As the blue lettered display before his eyes warned at a deceleration exceeding six gees, he began to feel very small indeed.One man inside a g suit, which was inside a mobile Suit, which was inside the TEC, which was at that very moment penetrating the bloated atmosphere of a planet more than three times as massive as Earth.All that remained was for God to show up and dropkick the planet.The atmospheric entry had officially begun only three minutes before, the four TECs advancing in single file, distanced ten kilometers from one another as they streaked across the sky at just under eleven kilometers per second.That figure was history by now, the speed bleeding off so quickly Kaiser could feel his eyeballs trying to push their way further back into their sockets.The digital deceleration indicator was no longer blue but grey, although he knew nothing was wrong with his instruments; he was momentarily colorblind, in the graying out stage before complete loss of consciousness.He also knew that he was only a powerless passenger; The TECs onboard computer was the current pilot for the flight, and it would be taking care of the entire voyage down to the planetary surface, landing included.But most of all, he knew what would be expected of him from that moment onwards.And wouldnt it be awkward if his subordinates were met with inanimate silence instead of leadership?Lippard would certainly tease him mercilessly afterwards, although that idea he didnt quite mind.He clenched his fists until his knuckles were white, breathing in low grunts as the moment of greatest deceleration came and passed.The seconds slowly bled away.Already reverting to its sky blue coloring, the deceleration indicator finally dropped below three gees.Kaiser mentally ordered the OS to indicate airspeed instead.It was time to get to work.Visible Light Orbital Images had shown the landing site to be almost entirely forested, with the exception of several clearings, each about thirty meters in diameter and set within a region four kilometers across.There had been no positive identification of artificial structures like those found twelve hundred kilometers to its north east, but near infrared imaging had pointed to something else; the area comprising twenty by fifty kilometers was noticeably darker than its surroundings in the false color images, and was roughly rectangular in shape.The clearings were all within that rectangle, and four would shortly be targets of visitation.Kaiser felt the TEC wobble slightly and veer towards the side.The capsule had found its target and was presently homing in on it.At least, that was what a flash message from its CPU was telling him via its link with the mobile Suits counterpart.Still entirely blind except for his OS indicators, unable to establish comms with his subordinates and unqualified to pilot his entry vehicle, he ordered his Suits OS to offer him instead a countdown to landing, feeling momentarily impotent as he watched the clock count backwards from four minutes and eight seconds.As the seconds passed slowly by, Kaiser took the time to personally reconsider his orders.They had seemed quite simple when studied from orbit, or at least as far as the commander giving them was concerned, he thought.But when one is hurtling downwards towards the unknown, plan B suddenly becomes just as important as plan A.  And plan B, in that instance, wasnt altogether too encouraging.He considered his options.The very thought of them left him decided to do his usual.Carve out a plan C.   The warning beep signaling the sixty second mark returned him to reality.He paused for a moment as he collected his thoughts, and then set about checklisting his status.Given another silent order, his OS responded immediately, supplying him with a virtual stereoscopic HUD upon which were displayed several small rectangular panels.Providing the adequate neural impulse every time he locked his eyes on a panel, thus selecting and displacing it closer towards him, he checked his operational status, quickly arming his weapons and synchronizing the reactors ramp up with the moment of touchdown.Aside from the chirpy sounds playing into his ears every time a panel was opened, checked or closed, he was pleased to hear the thrum surrounding him become somewhat louder and higher in pitch in response to his adjustments.As the countdown continued past the thirty second mark with another loud beep, Kaiser left a final panel open before him, willing himself not to activate it before touchdown.The panel lay in the foreground, almost blotting out the digital countdown and other backdrop indicators, and its coloring was presently azure.In a few moments, the panels activation would turn it green in color, and then the panel would automatically drop back into the semi transparent miniature of the initial HUD display below and to his right, where his right pauldron was usually visible beyond.If there was a failure of some kind, it would either drop away red, which would be a bad sign, or maintain its current position, flashing crimson with a corresponding verbal warning, which would be far worse.A clear, serene female voice spoke out clearly, giving a verbal countdown towards landing as if she were calmly reading the numbers from a scroll.For the second time since having begun atmospheric entry, Kaiser felt his spine tingle in anticipation.His entire body began to key up until, just as the count hit the five second mark, he heard a muffled thump, and then he felt his back suddenly press against the Suits interior exoskeleton as the g suit within began to tighten around him once more.The deceleration was much more intense than before and, as he heard the last three seconds being announced, his magnified hearing caught the unmistakable roar of retrorockets firing.And then the pressure ceased entirely, immediately compensated for by the sudden relaxation of his g suit.Kaiser hadnt even felt the bump of the landing, so smooth had it been, and yet, just as his OS had been programmed to do, he suddenly gained stereoscopic vision, with display overlays duly set at differing depths of perception, figuring dominantly since the mobile Suits oculars were still in complete darkness.Kaiser eyed the dominant panel and activated it.The panel blinked, glowing suddenly red, and trailed away towards the miniature HUD, momentarily leaving a crimson streak in his field of vision.Scheisse!he muttered.A brief flash of blinding light accompanied several loud popping sounds, the sudden light being immediately compensated for by the OS before his eyes had even managed to adjust.The TECs four petals had released, deploying promptly outwards and freeing his mobile Suits extremities.The solitary red panel still present in the Op Status HUD blipped once more, turning a verdant green color.Kaiser sighed inwardly in relief; apparently in his zeal he had jumped the gun, activating Suit mobility too early.He lay there for a moment, a feeling of unreality gradually stealing over him as he contemplated his surroundings.The sky was the same blue as the unchecked panels, effectively obscuring them from his sight.The system automatically compensated for that, offering Kaiser the option to change to an appropriate setting.Duly altered, the unchecked panels glowed a bright purple for as long as the backdrop was blue.It was certainly the most beautiful of days.There were almost no clouds in the sky, the few present nonetheless whizzing darkly overhead with unnaturally high speed.His immediate surroundings, however, were a hazy brown from the violence of the landing, and he could see at least one of the jettisoned braking chutes clinging to the trees at the edge of the clearing, threatening to blow away due to the strong wind that was ruffling the forest treetops.The sound, however, was quite unlike anything Kaiser had ever heard on Earth.The chirping cacophony of birds was terribly intense, as avian species of all kinds swooped through the air in alarm at the intrusion upon their domain.To his great surprise, Kaiser found that the clouds hed seen before were nothing less than massive pulsating flocks of birds seemingly disturbed by his arrival, and indeed as one such flock strayed closer towards him, his magnified hearing clearly caught the intensifying swoosh of thousands of flapping wings until, veering away, the sound abated to a rumble.He was astonished by the awesome, almost exorbitant, display of life, a vision quite unlike anything he had encountered in person before.Never again, he thought in wonder.Never again shall I set foot on another spacecraft or planet, this is where I will live and where I will die, Kaiser privately promised himself.His sense of balance told him that he was still lying on his back.He stood slowly, one careful movement at a time so as to leave the entry capsule undamaged, and his eyes assessed the state of his appendages, focusing especially on the pulsed laser platform gripped between his mechanical hands.A massive titanium carbon nitride coated thumb flicked its selector to semi auto.Holding the rifle in his right appendage, Kaiser flexed his arms outwards and around in a practiced movement, the feedback to his interior exoskeleton telling him that his freedom of movement was currently unimpeded.Surging forwards, the Suits heavy pads stomped loudly over the ramp provided by one of the petals, until moments later much more muffled footfalls could be heard as he padded over the clearings grass carpeted grounds.The other TECs must already have landed, he decided.Activating the short range radio comm, Kaiser broadcasted into the unknown.RecOp Chain, Kaiser here, Over.A brief moment later he was answered.Kaiser, Lippie here.He felt his spine tingle at the sound of her husky voice.Received, Lippard.RecOp Chain, sound off, over.Lippard here.Moose here, over.Deadhand here.So operators two, three and four were currently up and running.A perfect drop, he thought with some relief.Chain received.Execute recce as previously established.Stay off the air, over.Kaiser waited for their acknowledgements, receiving them mutely as he itched to set off on his own.He had exactly one hour to beat his part of the bush before rendezvous four kilometers to the north east.Conjuring a semi transparent overlay of the area, Kaiser dragged it with his eyes to the bottom left of his visual display.Taking a few steps forwards, he watched as the semi spherical virtual compass beside the map danced about due to interference from the myriad local magnetic fields.The planets magnetic field was just as weak as hed been warned.Hed have to keep moving while the CPU computed the mean magnetic average, all just to keep his maps top edge pointed north.After making the necessary adjustments Kaiser finally set off, making a slow circuit of the clearing as he peered at his surroundings.Magnifying a spot of earth on a foreground overlay, he found it littered with what appeared to be bone white seeds between the clumps of grass, their number increasing sharply as he neared the center.Kaiser scraped his left gauntlet along the soil, bringing up more dirt than anything else, pocketing the yield securely inside an empty pouch on the Suits tactical vest.He then moved into the forest with rifle snug against his breastplate pylon, roaming in a spiral trajectory so as to get a feel for the surrounding area.Despite the Suits sizable dimensions, the trees were tall and well spaced, offering him a meter of ceiling as long as he carefully chose his route.The woods had definitely seen the hand of man.They had the feel of a kempt plantation, although the trees themselves didnt have the look of a rapid growth type.And what on Earth do you know about trees?He asked himself.Enough to know that sooner or later they fall, and there simply do not seem to be any of those lying here, he mused as he searched around.Yes, he concluded confidently, despite the overwhelming abundance of animal life the place reeked of mankind.As he moved along at leisure, stopping every few moments to allow his ears to do some exploring of their own, he happened occasionally upon the local wildlife.Aside from the great abundance of birds, whose panicked calls chafed at his ears whenever he got too close to them, Kaiser crossed paths with a troop of small monkeys taking refuge in a particularly robust tree, and they let out all manner of shrieks as he curiously inspected them.He had never seen a live monkey before.Soon afterwards he also crossed paths with a fleeing deer and a shy red fox, although both made themselves scarce in a heartbeat.If it hadnt been for his systems motion alerts, he would probably never have known they were there in the first place.For most of the hour allocated to him for solo reconnaissance, Kaiser searched his surroundings, finding not a sign of recent human activity.Despite coming upon some narrow roads, clearly intended for use by tracked vehicles, he had been unable to detect a single tread on them, although all led north westwards to where the nearest known settlements could be found.Kaiser also noticed at least an earth years worth of undisturbed vegetation growing over those roads.Arbitrarily selecting a tree, he inspected it closely, finding large clusters of seeds bending its taller branches.Detaching one such cluster, he noticed that the seeds were akin to those he had found on the ground of the clearing, although smaller in size and bright green in color.Those seeds also found a place in one of his pockets.Every few minutes his ears popped, and he would deliberately yawn to compensate for the slowly rising pressure inside his Suit.The air pressure would soon stabilize at over three Bars, and hed be more susceptible to ear infections from that point onwards, or so he had been informed in his briefings.But the change was unavoidable.Without pressure equalization with the outside atmosphere, he would never set foot outside his Suit again.Five minutes before the expected rendezvous time, Kaiser arrived at the meeting point, a large clearing of about forty by fifty meters across.The choice of the site had been a vital one, and had hinged on the two advantages it provided.The first was the substantial waterline situated only a short distance beyond its northern border, the second being that it would take the least work to prepare for the next phase of their mission.For the moment, Kaiser remained still at the clearings center, watching the mission time slowly progress as he pondered on what he had observed over the last hour.The first sign that he was no longer alone came from the north, where an immense flock of birds suddenly took flight.He knew who it was without having to ask.Less than a minute later, and precisely on time for the rendezvous, a second mobile Suit clambered its way into the clearing.With rifle slung across its torso, the Suits upper appendages parting tree branches as it progressed, clearly not caring in the least for the pathway of destruction it was leaving in its wake.The V 38 Hellmouth Harrower was nearly as beautiful to his eyes as the driver currently inside it.Guten morgen, mein Lippie, he greeted her playfully.Morgen, dag, oder nacht?You know as well as I that this rock has no morning, mein Kompaniechef.Are the others lost?Lippard inquired.Lippie, it doesnt pay to criticize our kinder so.They will find their way here in good time.Find anything of interest?he asked kindly, laughing secretly at the tone of her voice.Lippard had a habit of firing her cannon indiscriminately when she felt rattled by something, and she was certainly rattled at the moment.There is no fight here!I was expecting everything, anything, except for that and the verdammte birds.They have shat on my Suit.They have shat on my gewehr.And theyve shat on your helm!Lippard was met by her commanders raucous laughter, his mobile Suit shaking slightly as he entertained the idea of being covered in guano.Silence, you swine!Do you want my report or not?!she demanded.Speak, Lippie, he replied.Lippard filled him in.Speaking mostly in English, but reverting occasionally back to Germanic as she was prone to do whenever they were alone, his lieutenant informed him that there were no recent traces of human activity to the north of their position, and that she had found three streams flanked by deep ravines, the closest of which was the one previously detected in the orbital images.Other than that, she had found nothing of interest for her commander.By the time she was finishing, Kaisers motion alert informed him of movement to the east of the clearing.Unlike his or Lippies Suit, Moose was equipped with the V 35, an earlier Hellmouth design developed as a heavy weapons platform.Presently its weapon pods were empty, its only operational armament being the laser platform and heavy combat knife that had been distributed to all members of the team.Moose here.Apologies for the delay, he stated simply as he sauntered over.It was quite unlike Moose to say much more than that.That trait had apparently been a source of irritation for many of the soldiers previous superiors, but it was what Kaiser most liked about him.Moose never said more than he really needed to, and he always got the job done without muss or fuss.Your report?No local inhabitants.And no ones been around for the last several months.This place feels like a plantation of some kind, but I cant tell what theyre growing.Trees, perhaps?Lippard mocked.They waited for a full five minutes before Deadhand finally arrived.The latecomer closed in not from the south, but from Kaisers arrival point instead, his V 38 heavily smeared with mud and leaves.Deadhand here!he stated obviously, out of breath by the sound of his voice.My dear sergeant, you are very well camouflaged, Kaiser remarked.Hah!Well, there was one hell of a ravine to cross.I kept moving to the east for a better crossing, but I didnt find it.So I crossed where the river was wider.Place had a couple of meters of mud there, for certain.I slipped down the opposite bank when the ground collapsed and camouflaged myself in the process.Also had some trouble figuring north.This land must have some heavy duty iron deposits, cause I kept losing my bearings over some points.Yes, it seems we must resolve this problem in the future.Very well, Deadhand, any contacts?Not a soul.This place has been empty a while.Yes, we are in luck.Before we contact Command, we should take a short trip to the nearby stream.I believe it is time to take care of ourselves, Kaiser suggested.In Commands infinite wisdom, and partly due to water restrictions on board the EFF Leviathan, his teams had been strictly prohibited from using their usual g suit, the MS 3 uniform, which required more than 10 liters of fresh water to function properly.As a result they had been forced to use a model intended exclusively for gradual accelerations, utterly useless against the sudden knocks they were susceptible to while simply moving in a V 38, much less in actual combat.Adding to the discomfort, the current suits occupied less volume than the MS 3 and so provided a poor fit with the V 38s interior exoskeleton, compounding eventual shocks and reducing the precision of motor movements.Yet there they found themselves, in a land where there were actual rivers of the precious liquid flowing all over, and their uniforms were neatly stowed in their Suits tactical vests, practically begging to be worn.The team moved in a diamond formation towards the river Kay, as it had temporarily been christened, their leader giving his orders silently via the Swarm Operating System.The SOS processed the data acquired from all four Suits via short wave radio, using the highest ranking Suits CPU as a hub to relay the information to its driver and, under his direction, to the remaining Suits.Kaiser noticed as they moved that their collective data provided a much more precise reading of magnetic north, realizing that a pair operating about a hundred meters apart might avoid losing their north that way.He stored the newfound knowledge away for future consideration as the waterline came into view.Lippard and Deadhand hadnt been exaggerating about the waterlines; the shallow stream there was accessible only with great difficulty by a person on foot, located as it was at the bottom of a steep gorge about twelve meters deep, and with an average width of fifteen meters.He wondered how the winters must be like there for a simple stream to cut so steeply into the rocky ground.Following Lippards directions, the group moved east a hundred meters until they came upon a section where both sides of the gorge had collapsed.Deep, massive padprints could be seen traversing the stream from north to south.This is where I crossed.We can get there on foot now, she stated confidently.Moose, Deadhand, dismount and water your uniforms.Lippie and I will stand by.Keep your comm up, you hear?They acknowledged his transmission, and shortly afterwards he watched two tiny human figures as they scurried into the gorge with uniforms in hand.Damn, its dark out here.Its all redder than it looks like in the Suit, Deadhand remarked, apparently out of breath again.Several silent minutes passed as the operators proceeded to fill their uniforms, the humming sound of the water pumps clearly perceptible to Kaisers ears.The men then traded the g suits for their duly filled uniforms, taking advantage of the opportunity to quickly wash themselves in the stream.Their frequent coughing was beginning to worry Kaiser.Moose, is something wrong with the air?he asked.They cannot hear you, Kaiser.Theyve taken off their mikes to wash, Lippard informed him, her tone telling him she was concerned as well.Their worrying was all for naught.Before long, both drivers had made their ways back to their Suits, stowing the surplus garments away in a storage pouch before clambering back in.Aaah!Major, this is divine.Its like getting your skin back!Deadhand declared as his Suit stood tall once more, ventilating audibly as he did so.I heard you and Moose coughing.Is something wrong with the air?It aint good, thats for sure.As soon as I was out there, I started getting a sour taste in my mouth.Moose got it too.And I feel like I just came back from a long run.Hes feeling drowsy, by the way.Are you unwell, Moose?Lippard inquired.Not feeling too good.My nose and throat are burning.And my face.Trying to keep my eyes open ...he replied softly, his Suit swaying slightly as he spoke.Moose, safety your weapon, Kaiser ordered.Deadhand, escort him to the meeting point and deploy the beacon.Im going to contact the Leviathan.Kaiser, is that wise?Lippard asked cautiously.It is the carbon dioxide.Its level is over four percent, and we were told to expect the symptoms.Nothing can be done about that except to stay in our Suits.But we have already confirmed that the area is abandoned for now, and all the necessary conditions are met.It is time.Kaiser declared, leaving no room for discussion.As the two sergeants returned to the meeting point, Kaiser checked his timetable, noting that he was currently well within the window of opportunity to contact his command.Deploying the Laser Communications Array, the commander signaled his mothership.The Leviathans Operations Center answered without delay and they communicated for the following few minutes, trading authentication codes before he transmitted a brief report of what theyd come across.The Leviathans answer was quick and to the point; The Ebony Tower would be making its landing within the next two orbits.You have given us only three hours to prepare the site, Lippard remarked petulantly once he had broken off contact.Then we must not delay, Lippie.Exit your Suit but keep your skeleton strapped on.Kaiser set one massive kneepad on the ground and placed his gauntlets in a supporting position atop the other.Giving his OS the appropriate order, he suddenly lost his visual of the exterior, finding himself in complete darkness as his Suit began to power down.As he removed the display helmet, it was brusquely pulled out of his hands and upwards by the cranial appendage, coming to a rest just below the ceiling of the performance sphere.The interior lighting blinked on, illuminating him with a red glow as he observed the biomechanical exoskeleton encasing his body.His two subordinates had opted to extricate themselves from that structure before abandoning their Suits, thus subjecting themselves to the planets gravitational pull and increasing their weight by thirty nine per cent.Adding to that the exotic atmospheres oppressive influence, it was no surprise that they had run into difficulties, since any physical exertion in a high carbon dioxide environment would result in the slow poisoning of their organisms.There was, however, a more elegant solution.Reaching behind the skeletons back plate, Kaiser felt for the extension switch and then turned it, activating the dorsal appendage.The dorsal connected the CPUs cables to the skeleton itself, allowing the Negative Feedback Interface to exert its effect, while at the same time keeping the driver suspended in the center of the sphere.Once activated, it lowered the exoskeleton until his feet touched the flooring.Kaiser then pulled the two release pins located just above and below the extension switch, freeing himself from his umbilical support.He quickly opened an access panel near the forward exit, removed his Caudal Mk 2 self defense weapon and connected its side strap to the skeleton.Last of all, Kaiser removed his mobile Suits remote control and clipped it to his wrist.As he pressed the control, the exit panel emitted several clicking sounds and then popped audibly inwards, followed moments later by the exterior armor plate as it hinged outwards.Deadhand had been right.It only became another world when seen with ones own eyes.Although he found himself mostly in the shadow of an overhanging tree, Kaiser could still feel the burn of the red sun above.Gliese 667C, he had been informed.Although only a sixth of its light was in the visible spectrum, the red dwarf nevertheless exerted an astonishing effect at infra red wavelengths, keeping the precious planet warm beyond what one might otherwise have expected.The stars power was prodigious but there was another reason for its present strength.Kaisers landing had taken place on the eve of summer.Within fifteen days, the satellites continuing orbit would take it more than twenty five million kilometers away from the star, depriving it of almost half its precious warmth.How Earthly life had managed to take root so deeply was a mystery to him.Kaiser was forced to use his flashlight to search for the heavy uniform, and he found it neatly folded and sealed in a bottom pocket of the Suits tactical vest.The mobile Suit hulked over him as he removed the garments, watching silently as its driver turned away and jogged at a brisk pace towards its kneeling twin.Lippard was already waiting for him with a coy smile on her face, her aristocratic beauty not in the least bit lessened by the bulky armor of her exoskeleton.As usual, her silver hair was rolled into a tight bun, giving her a somewhat severe look that contrasted greatly with what he already knew about her.Kaiser pecked her lightly on the lips, their maraging steel sternums clashing noisily in the act, and the two drivers set off quickly towards the waterline below.*****      Over the following ten minutes, Lippard was forced to gently defeat two amorous advances from her superior, who seemed unable to simply watch as she washed herself in the cold, clear stream.Kaisers demeanor when they were alone was something others who only knew him professionally would perhaps never guess, she thought with amusement.The Bavarians worry lines disappeared almost entirely, to be replaced by gentle crinkles around his eyes.His playfulness was almost puppy like sometimes, although she was quite sure his order for their teammates to return to the meeting point had not been so innocent.If I didnt know better, mein fhrer, I would think you intend to achieve another first for the Earth Federation Forces, she laughed playfully as he began to snuggle against her for a third time.Uhumm ...meine liebe, you are entirely wrong, such a thought has never passed through my mind.Wha  what are you doing?!Why, putting on my uniform, of course.Since you are so intent on being noble, she sighed sadly, secretly delighting in his disappointed expression.Kaiser, Deadhand here.Moose is recovered and the beacon signal is strong.Umm, coming any time soon?an inquisitive voice squawked from his discarded earpiece on the ground.Kaiser snatched up the earpiece and answered as Lippard continued to re suit.Kaiser here.We will arrive in five mikes.You may both begin clearing operations, Over.Only five mikes?Why the hurry?there was a hint of humor in Deadhands voice.That is all.Over and out, the commander replied levelly enough, an embarrassed smile momentarily present on his face.Deadhand had spoken the truth, she thought.Re encasing herself in the exoskeleton with Kaisers assistance, she noticed how much more snug the fit was, and found herself feeling more at ease as she moved around.Donned his own skeleton, the commander kept up his indignant expression as they returned to their larger halves, petulantly warning her not to be surprised if he didnt power up immediately, as hed possibly be satisfying himself in the PS over the following few minutes.Lippard laughed at that, mostly because the chances of her commander doing such a thing were about as high as the planet spontaneously combusting.Kaiser was not the sort.Even his advances towards her moments before had been nothing more than light flirtation.He certainly knew Lippard would never have yielded.As they were approaching the Suits, he turned to her, curious.Come with me, Lippie, I want to show you something, he said, and he set off briskly towards his kneeling Suit.The commander leaped athletically onto its massive right thigh and proceeded to search the enormous tactical vest, removing what looked like a cluster of green grapes from one of its pockets.From another such pocket he removed a handful of dirt, and began to studiously sift through it, pecking at objects in the pile with his thumb and forefinger.Apparently satisfied, Kaiser discarded the remaining soil and, dropping back to the ground, his skeleton absorbing the impact with as much ease as it would on Mars, he sat casually on the titans left foot, working one of the bone white objects with an articulated pair of pliers he carried with him.What is it?she asked.Curiosity caught hold of her, knowing well that few things merited so much attention from him.The officer did not answer immediately, but instead appeared to be trying to crush the seed like object with the pliers, and apparently with great difficulty since, despite the strength augmentation provided by his exoskeleton, he hadnt yet succeeded.With an audible crack and to Kaisers pleased exclamations, the seed finally succumbed, revealing a rich red core inside.Rubbing the interior vigorously with his gloved thumb, he touched it to his tongue.Nein!Lippard exclaimed, suddenly alarmed at his behavior.Disregarding her reaction, he held one of the halves towards her.It is quite safe, he added as she hesitated.Feeling foolish and slightly nervous, Lippard brought the rust red core to her lips and licked it lightly.The taste caught her by surprise.Blood.It tastes a little like blood, she commented, studying the object in her hand with distrust.Not blood.ferrous oxide, meine liebe.This place is all an enormous mine.See?Kaiser exclaimed, breaking one of the green clustered seeds open with much greater ease.Its core was a somewhat paler red color, just shy of pink.The seeds store the mineral in them as they develop, and when they are mature, they are cultivated.My landing site was full of the ripe white seeds on the ground.That is why they would have a plantation so far from their cities.This location must have enormous iron deposits, and by collecting these resources using specially engineered trees, there would be no need for the locals to remain here in any number.They must be using the clearings to collect the seeds before transportation, I think.I knew that Command was up to something.And I was right, wasnt I, Lippie?he finished with a sly grin.Have we just captured an iron mine?she asked as she looked around her with a new interest.He nodded enthusiastically.And perhaps not only iron, Lippie.There are other plantations near this one, and I expect they might have hybrid species of trees collecting other minerals from the soil.But how can this be used?Simple, I think.The seeds oil and organic materials must all be quite flammable.The seeds need only be incinerated in a foundry, with the bonus of the organics supplying some of the carbon for steel production.We have seen this before on Mars, remember?Although the colonists there were unable to fully address the low light conditions found so far from the sun.These locals seem to have solved that problem.Dont you see, Lippie?Most of what we need to get started presently surrounds us, Kaiser explained admiringly, slapping his armored thigh in enthusiasm and producing a stiff clang in the act.Lippard felt momentarily awkward as she wondered whether the local population would put up with that, or whether they would consider the capture cause for war.She quickly put the thought out of her mind; Command had certainly made its decision for very valid reasons.The EFF Leviathan had, after all, just completed its first interstellar voyage, despite having originally only been designed for interplanetary jaunts.No matter how many refits a vessel was subjected to, its end product would never be quite as successful as with a specifically designed ship.In the Leviathans case its current military payload for an IS mission barely exceeded four hundred tons.And how did one occupy an entire planet with so little hardware?Why, the answer was hanging on the trees around her, and she realized suddenly that the advantage the plantation afforded them could not be overlooked.She had unconsciously known that such extreme measures might be necessary, now that she thought about it.Duly re Suited, both officers returned to the meeting point to find that the sergeants were well into clearing operations.Having apparently given up on using the tactical knife as an improvised axe, the pilots were setting their Suits weight against the trees, uprooting them easily before dragging them out to the plantation and emplacing them amidst a rapidly growing abatis wall.As Lippard went to assist her comrades, Kaiser approached the beacon and repositioned it carefully at coordinates previously extrapolated from orbital images.Having done that, he joined his teammates in the freshly booming business of knocking down trees.A full twenty minutes before crunch time, the reconnaissance team had effectively cleared a circular area with a radius of forty meters around the radar beacon.As the minutes ticked away, the mobile Suits took up guard positions at the four cardinal points of the circle, facing outwards from behind the abattis as they awaited Ground Commands descent to the planets surface.Peering silently over the tortured roots of an uprooted tree she had personally emplaced, Lippard found herself hating the delay.It left her too much time to think.For the first time she wondered at the kind of people who lived there.Were they the sort to fight, or did they have the wisdom to know a lost cause when they saw one?If they fought, would they fight honorably, or would they fall into the vicious coward routine?Lippard knew herself very well; Mars had taught her a lot about what she could expect from herself in a fight.Her gauntlets tightened around her laser platform as she thought of that planet.Her conclusions over the conflicts origins had been about the only subject shed ever disagreed with Kaiser over, but then again he could be strange about such things.Lippard knew that if the last was to prove true for those people, she would kill them all if she was given the chance.An enormous sonic boom suddenly shook the forests limbs free of its avian inhabitants, announcing the imminent arrival of a behemoth.Moments later her OS motion alert warned her of a significant airborne signature above and behind her.She did not bother to look; a countdown had appeared in a foreground overlay and read thirty seconds to touchdown.She did not require instructions for what was to happen next.The mounting roar of retrorockets firing tore at her ears and she put her Suits kneepad against the trees root, lowering her profile as she began to key up for a potential assault.This was the most critical part of the mission; if they failed several hundred deaths would be on their heads, and the four would then find themselves stranded in a hostile environment.The roar began to intensify until it was screaming into her skull.A yellow alert appeared before her display, warning her that, due to the outside sound presently being above the tolerance of human ears, it was unsafe to exit her Suit.Still the roar intensified, since despite her OS having capped any increase in volume to her earphones, the vibrations were still somehow penetrating the armor.A powerful wind began to blow vegetation and all manner of wildlife beyond her, and entire clouds of flying creatures took to the sky in even greater numbers than before.Despite the protection her armor conferred, Lippard instinctively began to squint as great clouds of dust rushed past her, obscuring her surroundings as it scattered an intensifying blue light.The roar suddenly died away, leaving her surroundings hidden in a dark haze, and a fluttering relief passed through her as she realized that the descent had been completed.Hazarding a look over her pauldron, she could barely make out a massive silhouette rising above the dust cloud like a titans monolith.It was Kaiser who broke the silence.Well done, RecOp chain.Ebony Tower has landed.Rejoice, for we shall all be having lunch in a refectory today.FOUR      MEWAC Headquarters, 11H35, 17th of January, 2771      Toni was unceremoniously ushered into the dimly lit interview room, confident that he had committed all possible contingencies to memory.Then he laid his eyes on the interview team.Oh Gods, no.Sitting nonchalantly behind an impeccable beige table, supporting his weight on his elbows as he closely inspected his fingernails, was the Screamer himself.Lifting his eyes heavily towards the newcomer, a ghost of a smile played across the sergeants face as he appraised the recruits expression.To his right sat a perky female Lieutenant.Blood drained slowly from Tonis face.Mason gestured with a careless hand for Toni to take a seat.Suddenly very self conscious, the recruit quickly took it, trying very hard to relax his facial muscles as he did so.So.Mister Tardy.How are we doing today?Mason asked pleasantly.Surprised by the lack of venom, Toni replied with honesty.I guess Im a little nervous, Sergeant.I think so too.Boy, do you realize that, as you were waiting in the corridor a few minutes ago, you were talking to yourself?Moments ago a member of the administration came in here and warned me.Apparently he was quite concerned about your emotional health.Tell me, boy, how long have we been holding conversations with ourselves?he asked with mock concern.The Lieutenant beside him pressed a palm against her mouth to hide the smile beneath it.The smile was a dagger to his heart.Toni found himself momentarily unable to articulate words.Hastily he opted to forget all rehearsed answers and hazarded a wild foray into honesty.Well, sir, I honestly wasnt aware I was doing that.As I said, Im a little nervous and, since I have never been interviewed before, I was trying to think up answers for some questions I thought might come up, that was all.I just didnt realize I was mouthing the answers, he replied solemnly, watching closely as a comprehending and benign expression began to present itself on the sergeants face.He decided to ignore the woman; her reactions to the swordplay were beginning to fray his nerves, and his previously drained face had begun to suffer a rapid influx of blood.Yes, I see.I see.And why do you need to memorize your answers, boy?Is the truth not enough for me?What Im trying to say is, why would you need to deceive the Army?he inquired politely.Bastard, Toni thought.The mans face did not betray his intentions, yet Toni could see uncompromising hostility hidden behind his half smile.Sir, I understand my mistake.Its simply that, since I joined against my familys wishes, I thought there would be some questions regarding that.This is important to me, sir.Maybe I was trying too hard, he replied.Toni was saying much more that he had ever planned to, and he hated himself for it.Yes, I see.Trying too hard, yes.Well, shouldnt you perhaps have followed your familys wishes?It was not a question.He had stated it as a question, but it had been meant as a statement of fact.The sergeant looked pointedly over Tonis shoulder to the door behind him, and then back to him, and then held his hands outwards in an apologetic gesture.Toni realized what he was trying to say.The Lieutenant beside him was no longer smiling.Toni reminded himself of every single mistake he had made dealing with the man.And he understood, finally, how it all had come to that moment.Mason wasnt a man to be dealt with; he fancied himself the dealer, maker and breaker of men, and he would never have forgiven Tonis flaws any more than Toni could forgive him for what he was doing now.He accepted that fact with the sad recognition of someone who had just discovered an important secret too late for it to make any difference.And yet he found himself unable to stand and leave.Sir, was that a question?he asked innocently.No, son, it was not.It was a statement.A statement you have no need to comment on.The door is over there.I apologize, sir.I mean, I wasnt aware you required a comment, sir.My fathers advice to me was to forget about the Capicuan Defense Force.His opinion is that an institution that hasnt waged a single war in two hundred years is unable to justify its existence, and that it should be disbanded.I simply dont agree with him, sir.I think that the defense force is here to prevent wars, first and foremost.And as I see it, the best argument in favor of the CDF is the fact that there have been no wars up until today.Very few people consider that, I think.Im here because I believe in the CDF, and because I believe I can be useful here.I only need the chance to prove that, sir.he finished.For the life of him Toni couldnt imagine from where he had conjured the words.He had never considered himself to be articulate, but damned he was if he hadnt seen a sudden spark of interest in the lieutenants eyes.I see, Mason exhaled.So your familys pro abolition, and youre a rebel to their cause.But boy, oh boy, if you want to serve, then by all means serve.But tell me why you cant serve in the foot infantry.Or in the Command and Services Companies, for that matter.Do you have any compelling reason to justify being handed a hundred and twenty thousand Credit war machine?Mason asked, his face expressionless, his tone reasonable.Son of a bitch, Toni thought.He decided to give insane honesty one last try.No sir, I dont, except for the fact that I want this, he said.The answer sounded horribly wrong to his ears.Masons lips curled into a wicked grin and he began to laugh.HAH!Want this?Because you WANT this?Boy, that just doesnt cut it here!Everyone wants to be the hero, nobody wants to make the sacrifices.Thats rich!HAH!Boy, listen to me and listen carefully, because this is the honest truth.The Army is not a fair institution.If you wanted fairness and justice you should have gone to Varsity and studied Law.The Army cares about only one thing.Putting the right man in the right place so it can get the mission done!And, sorry kid, but I just dont see you there, I just dont see you inside a Suit.Have a nice day!he finished, snatching up a clipboard and brandishing his pen, a satisfied smile on his face as he searched for Tonis name on the roster.Toni didnt move a muscle.The Lieutenant had lightly touched her delicate fingers upon Masons muscled forearm, causing the sergeant to freeze as if stopped in time, digital pen hovering a centimeter above the clipboards data slate.Toni noticed the Lieutenants nametag, finding only her first name there.Her name was Rose.Good morning, Mister Miura, are you all right?she asked politely.Yes, Lieutenant, quite fine, he replied quietly.I see you have amber eyes.Almost golden, in fact.Not exactly an ordinary eye color, is it?No, Maam, it isnt.My mothers family has had a lot of transgen modifications going back a few generations.And your father?she inquired.My fathers a natural.He spent his first years in an artificial atmosphere.Step by step adaptation.Six year regimen.The Lieutenants pretty eyebrows furrowed, as if the news was particularly upsetting to her.And what does he think of transgenetic procedures?Hes against them.He  his whole family believes that human adaptation to Capicuas conditions should be a natural event.I see.It seems your father seems to be against a lot of things, doesnt he?Thats my father in a nutshell, Maam.I am a transgen myself, she confided in him as she perused the briefs before her, and so is our sergeant, here.Every driver out there is a transgen, although exactly what genes are at play is very important for this particular line of work.Your physical performance results are quite impressive.Unnaturally impressive.Especially regarding reflexes, coordination, rapid problem solving, among a few others.Ive taken a look at your mothers file.She has inherited some impressive abilities, but it seems some of your results dont entirely correspond to her, um, characteristics.So tell me, are you truly your fathers son?That was too much for Toni.He tried to cover his mouth, but the smile kept spreading under his hand anyway.A chuckle escaped from his mouth before he could smother it.Can it, boy!Mason growled menacingly.Im sorry, sir.Maam.Its alright, the lieutenant answered lightly, still smiling at his reaction.Maam, Im his son for certain, Toni answered confidently.We look too much the same, by far.Even people whove only just met us usually make the connection.I might not like it, sometimes, but I am definitely his son.A photo should be in my fathers file, shouldnt it?No.Your father did not apply for military service and, since the CDF doesnt have access to citizens personal information, all I know is what youre telling me.Strictly speaking, your mother doesnt have a file with us either, she added.What she does have is a service record.Service record?he echoed.Yes.Your mother fulfilled five years of military service before beginning her civil work with the government.Didnt you know?N no, I didnt.Well, in any case, either your father is a closet transgen, which he can keep a secret if he likes, or you have at some point in your life been the subject of a genetic procedure.Either way, well know what you are once the genetic profiling results come in.She studied a document intently as she spoke, ignoring the look of astonishment on the recruits face.So, you want to be a Suit driver, do you?she asked him directly, finally looking up.Y yes.Good.You will shortly be informed of our decision.Thank you.she added, giving him a smile before returning to her reading.The only sign that Mason was in any way upset came from the twitching muscles on the forearm the lieutenant had touched.Otherwise, he simply glared from beneath his shaven brows as the recruit silently left the room.The Interview was the ultimate challenge after two weeks of blood extractions, painful tissue extractions, urine and stool contributions, full body scans, neural mapping exams, vascular mapping exams, motor reflex and coordination tests, along with a barrage of logic, memory and rapid problem solving tests that had occupied the first week.Spanning the three days before the interview, the recruits had fallen victim to a second barrage, comprised of personality tests whilst attached to a temperamental neural scanner that kept going into automatic shutdown.Toni spent the evenings trying to get along with his fellow hopefuls, as well as reading from the meager partition of the base library reserved for those in limbo.Aside from outdated propaganda pamphlets, Toni had discovered a wealth of technical and mechanical literature, and slowly came to understand that he would eventually be expected to possess intimate knowledge of the Suits functions.The realization depressed him, especially when he considered his academic performance at Leiben High.On the other hand, it was with relief that Toni came to realize that the members of his provisional platoon harbored no hostility towards him, apparently preferring to reserve such feelings for the sergeant.Screaming Mason drank only at night, seeing as there existed some leniency on base regarding the pastime, just as long as it was after hours and off duty.At three AM sharp in their first night on base, an impressively drunk First Sergeant had elected to drag a casernful of sleepy recruits out of their beds and stand them at attention, giving them each an empty stare as the stench of alcohol slowly occupied the compartment.The Sergeant had then launched into slurred discourse on the chief military virtues, counting them off one by one with his fingers until he miscounted, got confused and gave up entirely, and had then proceeded to explain how his niece currently exceeded all those present in combat preparedness, adding as an afterthought that she was currently twelve.Tonis eyes had become irresistibly drawn to a crack on the opposite wall, and he had stared blankly at the imperfection for the remainder of the sermon, tuning out the sergeants chafing voice until it was no more than background noise (his father had trained him well).The monologue lasted for an impossibly long hour before an unsteady Mason finally abandoned the casern, braying one last insult over his shoulder as he did so.The sergeant kept up his nighttime visits with regularity, varying only in hour, number of accompanying corporals, and level of intoxication.The day after Tonis fateful interview, however, the Genetic profiling results finally came in, and before the afternoons end he was informed that he would be expected in uniform at 08H00 sharp Monday morning at MEWACs Suit Instruction Company.The report added that, in answer to Tonis form declarations, the medical department had scanned his genome and not found any defective genes relating to the metabolization of Folic Acid, and so there would be no need for supplementation or therapy.A sizable part of Toni wondered whether some administrative official had somehow botched things and listed him in the Inducted List instead of the Eliminated List.He made no effort, however, to correct their mistake.He also realized with some satisfaction that he would no longer have to suffer the Screamers abuse.*****      First lieutenant Matthias Templeton was a man whose physique did not suggest a military background.Though of respectable height, his slim build and narrow face suggested a fragile constitution, and his well combed blonde hair and lagoon blue eyes provided strangers with the impression of an upper class sophisticate.The manner in which he carried himself, however, ram rod straight and with a distinctive energy in his step, quickly belied such an impression.There was a confident, well mannered nobility in the way he walked and observed his surroundings, and the treatment he received from the subordinates who knew him bordered on reverence.Screaming Mason, for one, seemed to regard him as the coming messiah.The sergeant was grinning broadly as he preened beside his new lieutenant, both men quietly taking stock of the platoon they were supposed to forge into armored Suit drivers.A resigned Toni was still adjusting to the dim quarters interior, the yellowish lighting above doing a poorer job of illuminating the classroom than the sunlight that shone in through the high windows.There was a desk for each recruit to sit behind, although the group presently stood at attention as their new platoon leader appraised them.The lieutenant signaled to his drill instructor with a discreet nod.Sit down!Mason barked.There was a momentary racket as sixteen wooden chairs scraped against the concrete floor.The general consensus by now was that just about everything on base not made of wood was made of concrete.The lieutenant took his own seat on a stout chair of his own, Mason preferring to stand at ease beside him as the officer spoke.First of all, Id like to welcome all ladies and gentlemen to our esteemed institution, Templeton began without a hint of emotion.Although you have all been here for the last two weeks, everyones been so occupied with physicals and psychologicals that I believe you havent yet realized where youve landed.Id like to make that all very clear, so no one can claim ignorance when the screw ups begin.But before that, Id like to introduce myself.I am First lieutenant Matthias Templeton.You will refer to me as either Lieutenant or sir.There is no third option hidden in there, he paused for a moment and stared into the abyss, rubbing his hands together as the silence underlined his words.I am twenty and nine years old and this will be the eighth time I take babies off the tit.What I have just said, in case none of you caught it, is code for I have already heard every sob story out there.If I want to hear your sob story, Ill ask about it.But you can rest assured that I wont.The only victims I recognize are those who have ceased to breathe.The remainder are either soldiers or those who havent the courage to be one.Ive been a Suit driver for the last ten years, and I will say the following about what Ive learned over this time.No armored Suit driver is more of a soldier than a foot soldier is.If anyone tells you otherwise, tell them you have it on good authority that they are wrong.You can even quote me, if youd like.Anyhow, if you disrespect a footman and it reaches my ears, youll find yourself among their ranks faster than you can say chimpanzee, and that, my comrades, is a promise.Besides being your platoon leader, I am currently the senior subaltern in the Suit Instruction Company, liaison officer for the Leiben Army Education Program, assistant in the Physical Education Department, and manager of the Officers Mess.Many of you may wonder if these are what are commonly referred to as shitty assignments.No, they are not.They are perfectly respectable tasks and I perform them with the diligence required of a MEWAC officer.The Lieutenant paused once more, eyeing them as if expecting someone to disagree.Faced with the persisting silence, he continued.But due to these assignments, it is possible I may sometimes be forced to be elsewhere during your training.And so I expect all to regard our First sergeant as speaking with my voice when I am absent.His words are my words, except maybe a little louder.Is that clear?They declared in unison that it was all quite clear.At his Lieutenants beckoning, sergeant Mason introduced himself, although by now it was a futile exercise; they already knew his vital statistics by heart.Mason was the proud inhabitant of Leibens May 23rd neighborhood, a working class community that was renowned for producing about as many soldiers as it did trouble makers (which often meant the same thing, according to the sergeant).He was forty three, thrice divorced, the father of three boys, each from a different mother, one of which was serving as a cavalryman in the North Thaumantias Research Hub.And he liked to drink....and in 68 I received my fifth, and last, commendation, from the hands of Colonel Masters himself.I hear hell be retiring soon, isnt that right, Lieutenant?Mason finished, turning to his platoon leader.If Tonis memory wasnt failing him, that would just about mark the end of the first sergeants introduction.Yes, thats right, in a few months the colonel will be getting the rest he thinks he deserves, Templeton replied distractedly as he inspected his hands.There was the lightest of smiles on his face as he spoke, but a moment later it was gone.Toni had noticed how that smile popped up occasionally over the course of Masons monologue.He wondered what the Lieutenant truly thought of his sergeant.Alright then.Id like to hear your introductions next.Name, age, place of birth and why you joined the Army.Yes, that would do just fine, the lieutenant considered, and he turned to his right, towards a recruit not too dissimilar to him in appearance.The classrooms current seating arrangements had placed the most senior recruit to the extreme left of the front row.The recruit sitting there abruptly stood.Ian Templeton, nineteen years old and Leibenese.I joined because I was told to.The recruit promptly sat down without saying another word.If the Lieutenant was surprised by Ians reasons for joining, he certainly didnt show it.Instead he nodded curtly to the girl behind him.Rakaia Tani, Im eighteen and I come from the Terminator Research Hub.I, um, joined so I could get out of there, the petite soldier finished awkwardly before returning to her seat.Her awkwardness surprised Toni.The only time he had tried to speak to her, the Terminator spawn had given him a cold look, oozing hostility until he had put a safe distance between them.There was something about her pouting lips and widely spaced doe eyes that had fooled him into thinking she was approachable, but she had wasted no time in ridding him and the remainder of the platoon of that impression.Everyone just called her the Terminator now.Lieutenant Templeton nodded.So, what do you think of the day side?Its brighter ...Rakaia answered quietly.The boy behind her sniggered softly before standing.Raymond Rosa, sir.Twenty two and born in Leiben.I joined cause I wanna be a Hammer Driver!he sat back down with a haughty expression, having earned a soft smile from his lieutenant.Ray was a trouble maker.Which was why Toni liked him.They were fast becoming mates, their friendship having received a recent boost due to the seating arrangements.Tell me, Raymond, Templeton asked, what have you been doing those long years since you left school?Been helping my pa at the mines, sir.I see.Alright, next ...As the following student stood to introduce himself, Toni noticed Mason giving Ray a cold look.He found that odd, owing to the fact that Raymond and their drill sergeant hailed from the same neighborhood.He made a mental note to ask Ray about it at first opportunity.Aside from Ian and Ray, none of his fellow recruits had been raised in Leiben, despite all having been born there.
