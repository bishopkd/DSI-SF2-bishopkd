Hes protecting the only territory we have and you and your rebel hating compatriots take him out.By the time you land, hes trapped in his own craft, and what do you do?Someone gives the orders to blast him right in his scav head!They stare at each other.Hey, I say, seeing my chance, perhaps it would be wise to take a moment and  I wasnt there, she says, ignoring me.I didnt give any orders.I was an apprentice on monitor.I saw the ship lying in wait and told them where it was.Before they got blasted.I didnt pull the trigger!End of story.He glares at her, and I sense him wanting to believe what shes saying.But there are old wounds rising to the surface; he cannot trust her, even if he wants to.I realize shes forcing herself to remain calm and reasonable.An enemy craft?Look.An apprentice doesnt plan missions.I didnt even know who the enemies even were yet.You should always know your enemy.I wouldve done things differently, okay?If Id planned that mission.Exactly, he says.That mission.Theres been more since.Theyre probably planning one right now.To come down here and do away with anyone who crosses their path.Guilty or not.Thats the mission, isnt it?Your mission.He shakes his head.You have a lot to be proud of, Lex.You can kill without remorse.So much for being reasonable.Do you think youre the only one whos ever lost someone?She pummels his chest, but hes stronger, gripping her wrists and holding them to her sides.I feel her pain course through me, watch her fight against restraints she cannot break.I want to run over, jump between them.I use every bit of strength I have not to.I have battles I dont want her to fight for me, and she doesnt want me in this one.This had to happen, I tell myself, and now you must allow it to run its course.Samantha, she says, breaking down.I had her, after all those years.I had her back.And now shes gone.I lost her too, okay?says Zavier.I lost her too....Lex stops fighting, and he eases up his grip, but doesnt let go.Lex, he says.She turns her head away.He chases her gaze until she has nowhere else to look.I can see where there should be a bond deepening between them, to be filled with grief that they can share.But they are too hardheaded to acknowledge that neithers pain is greater, that each is dealing with the same thing.She was my friend, Lex says.She was my sister, says Zavier softly.Once we found each other, I always looked out for her down here, and now she is gone, gone forever.40           Lex   She was my sister.Hows that possible?I say, pulling away from Zavier.Siblings are illegal.This is Rock Bottom, he says.Nothings illegal.Theres no EX2 pill.Some siblings even have different fathers or mothers.And some are just left on their own.Theres no Book of Indra telling us what to do.We already know what to do.Survive.He shakes his head, his face hard.You are so naive, he tells me.I cant think of anything to say.I hate that hes right.After that, he doesnt speak.Neither do I.  Livia starts to say something, but one look from me shuts her up quick.The tunnel we travel on eventually becomes a street, just like I saw in the Final Sim, except no church, and the residents are right out in the open.It looks safe, but I hold my blaster like a club just in case.Hausers out there, I know it.We follow Zavier, past places with signs like Old Town Electrodes and Bargain Rations and Blasters.We catch the curiosity of everyone we pass.Ignore them, Zavier says.You had a sister, I think.They wont bother us.Theyre sympathetic to our fight.You had a sister, just like me.He stops outside the Red Dog Saloon.This is the place you were brought here to see.Theres a long table along one wall.Behind it, a woman pours thick liquid from a bottle.A sign hangs above her head: Dirt Fuel by the Glass.He brought us all this way for a drink?On the other side of the table, every stool is occupied, almost shoulder to shoulder.A half dressed woman sprawls across an old mans lap.His beard reaches the floor and she twirls it with her fingers, laughing.Two men hold cards.One slaps down a handful and the other groans.A little man at the far end notices us and his eyes widen.Theyre here!he yells.The lady stops twirling the old mans beard.The men look up from their game.Cmon, says Zavier, ignoring the new attention the loudmouth got us as we pass.Zavier smacks the tar wall with his fist.Two taps of his elbow to the left, a swift kick to the right.The wall relaxes.A door swings open a half inch and he pushes it open the rest of the way.Better than a sim, I think, though Id never tell him.In fact, the idea of speaking to Zavier is just too much for me.We head down a rocky tunnel, and I start hearing footsteps that arent ours.I glance over my shoulder and see that theyre following us.All of them.Some still clutching their glasses of green brew.Weve become curiosities to them.Dont they realize following us could get them killed?Its not up to me to change their minds.Maybe, just maybe, we owe them something more.We continue to descend and at the end we reach another wall.Smack, tap tap, kick.Just like that, we are on the inside of the Rebel Base.Now we get to see what the fuss is all about.Hundreds of feet above our heads, the cavern finally crests.At intervals, there are levels cut into the rock, which signify the progress of their forebearers in the long, long ago.The surfaces are worn and smoothed by age.There is a warren of passageways that disguise the true inner workings of this place.We are wound through one and another; perhaps theyre trying to disorient us, Im not sure.Trust must extend both ways, I understand.No matter where we pass, I get peeks into these rebels lives.They are not all warriors.Theyre just people.Theyre a community.Some stock and organize their supplies.Nearby there are those that prepare food, food that looks nothing like rations, that has color.There are those that mend clothing and patch uniforms and repair blasters.Some of the young train together and practice combat exercises.Their classmates sit on the sidelines and observe.In rooms we cant see, Im sure some sleep and dream in this place that has no days or nights, just like how I grew up.But there is the greater hope that here children have room to play and be happy.Then I hear a note, and thankfully it isnt from a singing sword.A man holds an instrument.He runs his hands across the strings and its face, and the melody soothes me in a way I have never experienced.He sings and people gather to listen to him in an intimate dining area.I want to sit down before him.Next to me, Livia is breathing faster.Shes as stunned as I am.Lex!Livia!Kane flags us down and leaves the area to join us.I was worried.Im fine, Livia says.Were both okay.I lost you.And then I heard there were mutations and I didnt know if  Look at me, she says, holding her hands up for him to see.In one piece.His panic turns to relief.Then something else.An expression Ive never seen, not even for me.He takes her hand and she squeezes his back.Fury is bubbling up inside me.My face is hot with it.Hes mine, I think.Kane belongs to me.Who are you to just come in and snatch him?I break them apart by hugging him so hard hes forced to drop her hand to keep his balance.He doesnt need her, not as much as he needs me.Not as much as I need him.Shes had everything she wanted her whole damn life.But the airgirl cant have ...Its okay, Lex, Kane says, and I can feel all my emotions colliding so hard I cant even tell what Im reacting to anymore, and I hide my face in his shoulder.Weve made it.Were finally here.When I look up, Im looking right at Zavierand hes looking back.Instantly, every hair on my arms rises.My face goes from hot to burning.I dont have control anymore.Not over my words or my own body.Now Livia is staring at me.I wish everyone would just stop.I turn away so no one can see my face.I turn toward the cavern.Thats when I notice theyre watching me.Us.Theyre staring at Livia and me.All of them.Every face in the core low cavern.Theyve emptied into the hall and watch us and whisper.The whispers are rising.I think that will do, Roscoe booms.This is a momentous occasion, I know, but our visitors have had a long and difficult journey.Let us allow them time to adjust.They murmur in agreement and go back to pretending to ignore us.I still feel their glances, shot from the corners of their eyes.They talk, just as before, but Im pretty sure the discussions have taken a new direction.Enough!I say.My outburst surprises them.No more of this.No more talking like Im not here.Like Im not right in front of you.I look at Livia.Like we arent right in front of you.You must understand  I must do nothing, Roscoe.Ive already taken enough of your orders.Let you put a spike in my head, gone through your so called Safe Zone and watched my friend die.Now I want answers.And someone better give them to me, or well be out of here before you have time to argue.I look at Livia.She nods.Yes, she says calmly.We have proven our strength and survived, both with and without you.So perhaps now you will fulfill your end of the agreement.So, I say, tearing the cloak from my shoulders and tossing it aside.Where do we start?Because my sister and I have some serious questions.I hadnt planned to say it.It just fell out of my mouth.Sister.41           Livia   My sister.I have never known anyone who has a sister, or a brother.How these relationships are managed have never been illustrated for me.The depth of the bond and what our obligations to each other are cannot be anticipated.However, now I can see that protectiveness is one of them.I understand that, while how she feels about me at any given moment will change, we will forever share something that no one else does.We are bonded, whether we like it or not.Kane is Lexs friend, I know that.And yet I reached for him because that is exactly what I wanted to do.I held his hand, and if she were not there, I wouldve done more.Shes my sister, but she wont dictate my actions.I have spent a lifetime having others tell me how to live, and now that lifetime is over.I feel Kanes eyes on me.Im not shy about looking at him, either.However, its hard to ignore Lex at this very moment.Shes standing there with her hands on her hips.Are you ready, then?Are you ready to answer our questions?Roscoe gives a deep sigh, then nods.Yes.That is only fair.But we should conduct ourselves in private.Follow me.Im sorry, he says to Kane, but its best if you wait here for now.Zavier, show him where he can get something to eat.Weve all had a long journey.Kane grabs my hand.Ill be all right, I tell him.After all, you are the only one here whos tried to kill me.I dont bother to mention my altercation with Lex earlier.Hes ashamed, I can tell.He should be.Yet at this moment I want him to surprise me with a kiss.As soon as Im sure he wont try to poison me again, he wouldnt dare, I would kiss him back and hold it until Im satisfied.Perhaps if I made the first move?Lex glares at me.Let her do that all she wants.It wont change a thing about how I feel or what I want.I follow Lex and Roscoe, though I allow myself one last look at Kane.His lip curls into a smile.Improper.Most Improper.Some things are better down here.Its constantly warm here.We no longer need cloaks.Theres a ventilation system that circulates the air and keeps the electrical systems from overheating, but its a far cry from the climate controlled islands.Roscoe leads us through a tunnel that glows with fluorescent lichen and moss.It has been cultivated into long strips and circular patches that provide constant illumination.We try to avoid excessive energy use, Roscoe explains.Our mechanical systems are severely outdated, and a dampened heat signature prevents our detection, especially this far into the planets heat wells.The meeting room is circular, its floor a collection of area rugs.At the center are comfortable looking reposers.Theyre upholstered with fabrics I have never seen.I run my fingers along one covered with the softest deep blue material, and I feel a wave of exhaustion.I imagine, for just a moment, spreading out across the softness and closing my eyes and escaping everythingmutations and blasters and parazips and rebels.I have never felt exhaustion like this before.Of course, this is not possible.I know they would still be there in my dreams, overtaking me.The faces of the fallen on both sides: Hep, Durley, Jefferson.The dead PCF, zinger cutting through his chest, sprawled beneath the holo image of my father.Samantha.Im reminded of their sacrifices.I turn to Lex for comfort, and thats when I see what she sees: books.Entire shelves of them, arranged so neatly, in every size and color imaginable.Some are dusty and ancient looking, others as though they have never been opened.Books that have never even been touched!I have a feeling The Book of Indra is not among them.My study, says Roscoe, smiling at me.And please, my dears, make yourselves feel at home.Roscoe, I say.Lex and Livia are more appropriate.Of course.Can we start already?Lex says.By all means, Roscoe replies.Since you took that thing out of my head, somethings different.As is normal.By placing a chip in that certain location of your cortex, the IHC believes they can control certain emotions, like joy, and can then release the amount they deem fitting.They really control how much joy I feel?Yes, he says.Too much, they believe, is dangerous.Though they feel the same about too little.I feel the horror rising up inside me.They control pain in the same manner.Now, Livia has already felt those emotions.And so have you, Lex.Just to a slightly lesser degree.And now Im normal?Is that what youre saying?Lex asks.Those last few blocks have been removed, along with your chip.Now you will feel more depth of emotion.Your happiness more extreme, your sadness more intense.Removing the chip has made you who you truly are.At the core.As for normal, here is my assessment: you will never be that.And neither will you, Livia.Normal is not in your genetic makeup.You were both unique from the moment you were conceived.Thats what I wish to know, I say, my voice shaking.About being born.About my mother and father.Our mother and father.How it came to pass  That you were sentenced to an island prison?he asks.And Lex to the darkness below?Exactly, I say.Now my hands are shaking as well.Every part of me, especially my insides, jangling with energy.I have been waiting to answer those questions, he says, reaching into his sleeve, for longer than you could possibly know.He holds something in his open palm.Archive access chips, Lex says softly.The only ones, I believe, in the entirety of Rock Bottom.They are my most valuable possessions.Ones for which I would give my life.What are they?asks Lex.Memories, says Roscoe.I have kept them all these years.Kept them for the two of you.To be presented upon your arrival.You knew we would come?I ask.It was in your natures to seek the truth.And I have been here to make sure you found it.Here, he says, holding up chips, let me just show you.Im spread out across the reposer.Its as comfortable as I imagined.Sleeping, though, is the last thing on my mind.Roscoe sits to my left, Lex in a chair across from me.Her body is rigid, her face tense with worry.We have each built up stories in our heads on how this is supposed to go.Who we are supposed to be.Who our parents were.Answers weve searched for our entire liveseven if we didnt know it consciouslyare here and it worries us both.The truth isnt always welcomed.Each of us holds an access chip in our cupped hands.Roscoe has violated another of Indras rules and duplicated a citizens memories.Shall we?he asks.Yes, says Lex.Perhaps I nod, but I cannot be sure, for the room is spinning with my excitement, my head and body throbbing with anticipation.Then let us enter, he says, into your fathers memory.It is time you met him.Lean back.Two quick taps.Thumb to wrist.The last thing I see is Lex.We are there for each other, at this moment when we need it most.Ready?Yes.You?Yes.Now?Now.Then we close our eyes.42           Lex   A bright room, a woman sitting alone, back turned toward us.Her hands flutter through the air, releasing waves of color and music.The colors are dark, the song sad.I move toward her.Stop, says Roscoe.Any closer and we will be flung.Is she ...I can barely say the word.Our mother, says Livia.At her air harp.A man enters.Armand Cosmo, our father.Handsome as his portrait.He moves to our mother and puts a hand on her shoulder.At his touch, she slumps.The music stops and the colors dissipate.As he begins speaking, she stares into the colorless void.Why cant we hear them?I ask.Perhaps your father extracted the voices, says Roscoe.Perhaps this memory is too painful and he blocked out some of the details to preserve its integrity.The science is tricky.But how will we know what they are saying?How will we know when they  I stop suddenly.The woman looks up, and I see her face for the first time.Even through the tears, she is beautiful.You have her eyes, says Livia.I was about to say the same about you.Then everything fades.Darkness.We are somewhere new, and our mother is gone.I had her for a few seconds, but now she has disappeared once more.There is a hollow ache in my chest, an empty spot, and I realize it has been there as long as I can remember.I have never allowed myself to feel it before now.I do not have to look at Livia to know she feels something similar.We are in some sort of lab, though its small and a bit cramped.The place is cluttered with machines and monitors, a table of glass tubes swirling with liquid.Holocharts line the walls and a pair of mens shoes are carelessly left in the middle of the floor.Our hideout, says Roscoe, his voice sweet with nostalgia.We built this when we were children.You knew each other as children?I ask.Our whole life, he says.From neighboring islands.This is where we did our early experiments.Armands parents, your grandparents, encouraged us, when they werent perturbed by our occasionally explosive results.He chuckles to himself.We both ended up geneticists, but Armand was always the brilliant one.And this is where he escaped to do his most important work.A lab we built beneath the ground, with their permission.After the EX2, the High Council wouldve funded his every whim, a new lab with a view of the gardens was only the beginning, but he was cautious not to become indebted to them.And you?asks Livia.I found minor success in enhancements to keep my skills relevant, pictograms and the like.Designer birthmarks?Livia asks.That was you?Express your Individuality, he recites bitterly.The only genetic flaw you will actually want!Until they were outlawed, of course.Fascinating, I say dryly, circling the room for the fifteenth time.Your father evolved the field and pushed the boundaries beyond what anyone thought possible.But still he had time for me and a few others, to discuss our endeavors and help us, of course.It was only luck that granted me such a genius for a best friend and mentor.And where is he now, exactly?she says.Look, says Roscoe calmly, and you will see for yourself.Our father has entered with long, confident strides.This is much earlier, says Roscoe, before your mother and the air harp.How can you tell?asks Livia.Roscoe laughs.His hair.He wore it like that when he was young.One of his proudest possessions.He couldve grown rich just by enhancing the heads of others, myself included.As though my father has heard, he runs his hand through the strands distractedly.He does have nice hair.Thick and shiny and dark, just like Livia and me.Only his is wild and untamed like mine.Livia   Our father moves about like the ruler of a kingdom, like a man with answers.He checks a chart and adds a few notations.His penmanship is horrid.He catches his reflection in a beaker and quickly runs a hand through his shiny mop, smiling.I speak the truth, says Roscoe.The women loved it, too.In fact, they loved everything about him.Father removes a test tube from a rack and sets it in a machine that, when powered on, spins wildly.When it stops, the liquid in the tube has been separated into two distinct colors.He was invited to every Emergence Ball in Upper Indra.He teased the girls.Flirted.Made them fall in love.Yet ultimately, they bored him.He carefully pours the top layer into a funnel, where it flows through piping into a small analyzer.It beeps and he checks the monitor.Unsatisfied with what he has seen, he bites his bottom lip and paces the room.Until, of course, he met Delphia.Your mother.Father looks up with gleaming eyes and races to a chart and crosses out his newest notations.He scribbles around their edges and, upon observing his work, grants himself a self satisfied smile.One look at Delphia and he was finished.The other Proper Young Women became as interesting to your father as the air his island floated upon.Darkness.We are in a dressing parlor, our mother clicking a device.The soft surface beneath our feet goes from red to gold.Another click and we are standing on intricate tiles.This is an important night, I can tell, and everything must be just right.She strokes a blue garment, and it shimmers beneath her hand.Now shes at her floating vanity, running a colorizer across her lips.They turn bright blue and she wrinkles her nose at the reflection.Changes them back to their natural rosy hue.Never one for fads, Delphia, says Roscoe.Not even minor enhancements.Another face appears in the reflection, startling her.Our father, a devilish grin across his face.She swats him hard, laughing, and takes the colorizer to his lips.Instantly, they are a neon orange.He swipes the instrument from her and turns them back, though hes also laughing.She pins up her hair and he watches, mesmerized.He adored her, says Roscoe, a longing just under his words.Armand was probably not the only one.Our mother turns her face to our father and waits to be kissed.Darkness.A massive ballroom, and we are at the center of its polished dance floor.Their New Cohabitation Gala, says Roscoe.He is staring at someone and I follow his gaze.Young Roscoe, captivated by the presence in the room, perhaps more than everyone else.We are momentarily blinded by a swirl of enchanting blue.Our father has whirled our mother past us.They are what everyone is watching, and the reason is obvious: they are beautiful together.Her head is thrown back in pleasure, her gown swirling around them like an aqua cloud.I want to look at her forever.Darkness.Slow it down!I say frantically.I wish I could, says Roscoe.Mother and Father sit in a garden, framed by blooming lemon trees.They have been newly programmed by the gardeners, I can tell, the fruit plentiful, their fragrance sharp and sweet.I know their location, a spot deep within the orchards, a place where I spent many hours hiding from the demands of Governess.Mother and Father have aged quickly, or perhaps it is just the dimness in their eyes.Mother is crying.Father holds her hands, but she wont listen.She turns from his touch with a violent shake of her head.Please, Armand!she says.Lex and I look at each other, stunned.Her voice enhances and defies her delicacy.Lilting and powerful at the very same moment.Its mannered like mine, with all the anger of Lexs.Armand.Listen to me.I do not ask for much, and this is the only thing I want in the entire world.Nothing else matters.If they find out  They will not find out, she says firmly  We will lose everything, he finishes.My mother has tears in her eyes, but she is too strong to release them.My father holds her in his arms.I would do anything for you, Delphia.You know that.But you must know the consequences.She removes herself from his touch.I do not care about consequences!Everything in Indra has consequences.The IHC would punish you for breathing incorrectly if they Deemed It Inappropriate!They will take the things you love most if they find out, he says.Helix.Veda.They will take me, Delphia.Everything.They will not find out.We will make sure of it.The highest crime is blatant disobedience against the IHC.The highest crime will be if I cannot have a child.She draws farther away, the space between them growing larger.You blame me, he says quietly.You blame me for creating the EX2.You believe I did this to you.That it made you unable to conceive.But that is not the cause of this.I promise you.I would never create anything that did harm.This happened ...for some other reason.A reason I have yet to understand.Please do not blame me.I only want to make you happy.It does not matter who I blame, she says.The only thing that matters is who fixes it.She takes his hands, and I see that she has the power to make the smartest man in Indra doubt his judgment.Please say yes, Armand.Please, my love.Darkness.Wait, I want to say.I dont understand!No time to speak, for we are back in the lab, only it has changed.The charts are illegible, overrun with his scrawl.The water baths are overflowing with contaminated beakers and plates with half eaten rations or aborted experiments, its too hard to determine which.Our father circles the room.Hes changed as well: attire wrinkled, hair growing on his face, his smug smile replaced with defeat.What happened?I ask.Roscoe doesnt answer.Lex watches our father with deep concentration.He is doing this for her, she says.But why?A child, Roscoe says.That was all she ever dreamed of.And somehow, it would not happen.A genetic flaw, perhaps.Father sits in his chair and rolls up his left sleeve.He ties a length of rubber tubing around his biceps and punctures a vein with a needle.Bloods flows through some piping into one vial, then another.All the while he puzzles over formulae on his tablet.Another vial fills and another.That is where he hopes to find his answer.Within himself.He will not stop, says Roscoe, until he finds a solution.A genetic enhancement that will allow her to conceive.Darkness.A dim room, our mother sitting motionless, eyes screwed tight with concentration.To her left, our father holds a syringe full of thick liquid.She is not concentrating, I think.She is praying.He injects her.Darkness.Everything is moving too quickly.The memories are hurtling straight for us, becoming more agitated and frantic by the second.Melting into each other so fast there is no darkness or light, just a faint grayish overcast.Our mother, face glowing, with a hand on her belly.The hand belongs to our father, and he smiles as wide as she does.Darkness.Our father at his monitor, projections of the two fetuses growing within her womb.Darkness.Our mother at her air harp, belly enormous on her slender frame.The melody soft and lovely, her hands releasing crystalline shades of rose, the pinks punctuated by sudden bursts of crimson.Her eyes are closed, her smile blissful.Darkness.43           Lex   A curtain divides the lab.My father pours water on a white towel.He hurries behind the curtain where our mother, I strongly suspect, breathes sharply.Its punctuated by cries of pain.The cries become screams.Livia and I are causing her pain.This is our birth.Darkness.Were still in the lab.Young Roscoe stands patiently on the other side of the curtain.Roscoe observes his younger self, their expressions equally pained.Men who have no reason to celebrate.Our father slips through the curtains, removing his wrinkled and stained gown.His skin is colorless, his eyes ringed with exhaustion.Our father doesnt look like a man who has achieved the impossible.Are they healthy?Roscoe asks.He nods.And beautiful.Darkness.A baby cries, woken from its sleep.She knows its time, he tells Roscoe.The imprint and then you must go.Father pulls back the curtain.Mother is huddled on a sleeper, a baby clutched in each arm.It can only have been days, their flesh still pink.Theyve only had days as a family.Father bends down and takes a baby, which my mother kisses before she lets go of it forever.We have to hurry, he says, or it will be too late.Father passes the child to Roscoe.Thats me.Little Lex.I gurgle in Roscoes arms.This was the end of our only time together.Mother clutches the other baby tighter.She rests her chin against the small head, tears falling on tufts of brown hair.My father unwraps her arm and carefully takes Livia as well.Now her arms are empty.My mother buries her face in the sleeper to muffle her heartbreak.Father closes the curtain, leaving her to her privacy.He holds Livia in outstretched arms.Looks at her.She smiles, all warmth.She reaches for him.He allows her to grab his finger, but his eyes are cold and hard.His jaw trembles faintly.Notations are swept aside.Livia and I are laid side by side on his workstation.I watch, mesmerized, as he holds my chin still and lifts a laser to my eye.You will find each other again, he says.The laser flashes and baby me opens her mouth to scream.I close my mouth and stare at him defiantly.Little Livia is next.She cocks her head to the left and gives him a curious look.You will find each other and know.Just by looking each other in the eyes.Livia wails at the flash.My father chokes back his emotions and pauses as if making a decision.Put her in the cradle pod, he whispers.Roscoe places Livia in the tiny capsule.Shes asleep instantly.As Roscoe turns back, Father holds me tight.He kisses my forehead.Go with her, he says.Roscoe takes me.Father turns away from him, unable to bear the sight.When he looks back, Roscoe is gone.So am I.   I turn to the Roscoe still in the room.The old one who shows me horrible Archives.Where did you take me?I ask.The Lower Levels, he says quietly.The Orphanage.Livia   I am ready, my mother says as she emerges from behind the curtain to join our father, her face tearless and hard as stone.She lifts me from the cradle pod, and I remain asleep.My eyes move fast beneath the fragile skin of my eyelids.Hopefully I am dreaming of something pretty.It did not have to be this way, says my father.Of course it did.I could not live ...if they had not.She pulls me close to her chest.Besides, I should have left long ago.I hate this place.Indra.You can ignore the truth for only so long.We were never meant to be up here.The Founders did us all a disservice.Its not safe out there, he says.Not yet.Because weve stopped trying to make it so.Imagine if youd turned your mind to making that possible?Then our daughters would not exist.You cannot have everything.Her face softens.That doesnt mean we shouldnt stop trying.We owe the world to them.We must try to ensure that it welcomes them when the time comes.If only we could do that together.She stares down at baby me, then up at the ceiling.Anywhere but his face.Where will you go?he asks.Im not sure.My mother has told me all my life that were descendants of the Founders.That the blood of Atros is also mine and my childrens.But now I know his mistakes are ours as well.I will survive, do not fear.She takes a deep breath.I wish I was that certain about you.My father moves toward her, his gaze unwavering, until they are very close.The baby me gives a small sigh from between them.Look at me, Delphia.I cannot.Please, he says.Their eyes lock.Suddenly, she reaches for him, grasps him tightly, and pulls him toward her.She kisses him with ferocious abandon.A good bye kiss.She pulls away and then shes gone.44           Lex   We are returned to Roscoes study.In a cavern, I remind myself.In Rock Bottom.No one speaks as we remove our Archive chips.There is no more to see.That is all that remains of our parents.I cant look at Livia or Roscoe.I can barely tolerate my own racing mind.Where did she take me?Livia asks, her voice smaller than I expect.Her music studio, Roscoe says.She left you sleeping at the base of her air harp.She couldnt take either of you, she knew that.If she was found out, one of you wouldnt have survived.That was not an acceptable risk.And the imprint our father gave us both, I say, why did he do that?Only he and your mother have that answer.Great, Livia says.So well never know.Did you never receive your fathers research?Livia shakes her head.Marius told me it no longer existed.Marius?My guardian.Yes, yes, I remember Marius, but ...Waslo had orders.His face boils with anger.Your fathers work is rightfully yours!You should have been given that long ago.You must retrieve it at all costs.What about our fathers lab?Livia asks.Would it help if we went there?I should think, if its still hidden beneath your grandparents island, answers Roscoe.I ask, The Island, does it have a name?Orona.I havent been there since you were born ...The PCF raided it when they came after your father.They even instituted a no fly zone over its airspace for the shame he brought upon Indra.I even heard rumors that riggers tried to demolish it, but it was booby trapped, and they fled.That wouldnt have stopped a rigger, no way, I say.What about that law?The one you told me about.The Law of Twins, replies Livia.Yes, says Roscoe.I never heard of it in the Academy.Even in Indrithian Customs.It is not something spoken of even in Proper circles.An older law, though still viable.Not mentioned because it is so rarely needed.The EX2 pill, after all, was your fathers greatest creation.Not us?Yes, of course.He barely smiles.I am sure you take dosages yourselves.Livia and I look at each other.Of course we do, I think.Popping your daily EX2 is like getting up in the morning.You do it without even thinking.All thanks to one man.Our father.As you know, Indra must protect its limited resources.With the creation of EX2, multiple births would never be a problem.A single child limit could be easily enforced.I can hear the bitterness creeping into his voice.Want a child?Just trade the EX2 for the 2.2 Supplement.Conceive said child, birth the infant, and live pleasantly ever after.He sighs.As long as you resume your daily EX2 dosage, you will be obeying Indrithian guidelines to the letter.Is it used down here?Of course not.He sounds so clinical.The geneticist side, I know, but Im uneasy.Hes talking about children, after all.Hes talking about us.Its been days since Ive had my last dose.Livia, as well.I guess we will see what happens without our fathers invention.But why did he create it?I ask.To preserve Indra that is.Then he was a fool.Your father realized his mistake.Too late for him, and too late for us.Your father, Roscoe intones, paid for his foolishness.We have all made mistakes that haunt us, do not think that gives you the right to ...His anger overcomes him.But our mother, Livia interjects.It didnt work on her?No.She could not conceive at all.Could not have what she wanted most in the world: a child.So our father created something new to help her.Reason to say it would probably help any woman with a similar condition.Yes, but his lab was destroyed, and Indra had no need of more children.There are some flaws it does not wish to fix.Livia looks at me in the firelight.The imprint in her eye is shining.The people of Upper Indra are wrong to fear us, I say, and not to hope that we can show them a better future.Livia   There was no other option, says Roscoe.Since your mother refused to abort the embryos and insisted upon bringing the babies to term, she and your father only had one choice.She was a wise woman, Delphia.I miss her every day.Lex and I exchange knowing looks.She gives me a sad smile.There is no reason to ask Roscoe, for we already know the answer.We heard it in his words: I miss her every day.Truth be told, we probably knew long before that.Our mother is dead.And she has been dead for a very long time.What about our father?I say.What happened to him?After you took Lex to the Orphanage and Mother left me at her air harp?A strange look crosses Roscoes face.Pain?I do not know, he says.I never saw him again.From the tone of his voice, I know Armand Cosmos fate as well.Fathers outcome was most likely the same as mothers.I am an orphan, just as I always knew I was.We are orphans.You are special, Lex and Livia, Roscoe says.And even before you were born, Delphia already had a sense.A sense of what?asks Lex.Shes trying to keep strong, I know, yet I hear the faint shaking in her voice.That you would be special.Very special.And for that fact, your mother was eternally thankful.For the first time in my life, I do not mind that word.The injections changed us, Lex says.I do not know if that is what he intended, but I suspect you are correct.He knew you would have to survive on your own.Then he chose for us to be different, I say.The drive to be different, to separate from the pack, is what motivated the Founders.Our history may show us to be slow to accept new ideas and ways of thinking, but we desperately need them.We can always be better.Though Indra believes itself to exist in a perpetual state of perfection, you must show them what they cannot see.Perhaps the injections were an influence, but they are only part of what makes you two so special.There is far more to your uniqueness than a twist in your genetics.More?says Lex.How much more can there be?Shes reached her limit, and soon she will explode.Stay calm, I want to tell her, but I would be a hypocrite, as my own heart is racing, my mind searching for answers.I get it, okay?she continues.Livia and I are against the law.We have these weird capabilities  Gifts, says Roscoe.Maybe because of injections.Or maybe not.It doesnt matter either way.Her voice is growing strained.But what more could there be?We are freaks, end of story.There is also the matter of destiny, says Roscoe.Your destinies, to be exact.Destiny?Lex is incredulous.To the core with your destiny.Destined to be outcasts, perhaps, and you are destined to search for another set of saviors.Lets go, she says to me, before he fills us with more nonsense and half truths.I stare up at her face.She is an angry stranger, yet she is also my sister.I rise, standing next to my twin.But I cannot move with her.I think Roscoe misspoke.Destiny is written in stone.It is the stuff of make believe.An old man who still places his trust in make believe is a danger to both of us.Make believe, perhaps, he says, but let an old man believe in something.In the days after former earth but before New Indra, it is said that a pair of twins shaped the world into what it was to be.Andru and Atros, two of the Founders were twins, your ancestors.So some were taught, and yes, I am one who believes them, that twins will come again to unite our two worlds, the way theyre supposed to be.Since the Lower Levels came into existence, every child on the day they are born is told that one day twins will arrive below in their seventeenth year.And do what?asks Lex.Roscoe takes us both by the hand.Lead us all out of Indra.Lex   Livia looks like she might pass out.I put my arm around her, and shes amenable to my touch.Leave Indra?Well burn to a crisp, I say.Everyone knows that.Burn up the second we step outside.The earth is uninhabitable.Thats why we came here in the first place.Not the entire earth, says Roscoe.Just the area bordering Indra.That is the only place that still burns, but only because Indra wills it.The radiation is a by product of its own overworked ecosystem.But beyond that ...an inhabitable world exists.Some have already escaped to the Outlands.How come more do not flee?The journey is hard.The supplies, even harder to come by.Its not meant for all.How would they get past?I ask.There is a tunnel.It comes up right past the irradiated area.It is long and dangerous, but two such as you, you have already faced much worse.All hope that you will go yourselves, and seek out others who you will find living in the Outlands.Bring them back to the Lower Levels.Unite their forces with the ones already gathered.Sure, I think.Just that easy.With your help, Lex and Livia, we will take back all of Indra.Upper and Lower.I dont want to rule Indra, I say.Me either, Livia agrees.Then return it to its people, Roscoe says.That, I say, is core low crazy.Its people are what have gotten us here in the first place.I dont believe its possible, what he suggests.I dont think he misleads us, but Im far from a dreamer.Then I hear something.Livia, softly whispering in my ear.We can do it, she says.I feel it.Together we have experienced most of what this world has to offer, and found it sorely lacking.I have followed orders, and she has conformed to Indras highest social standards, and yet, here we are apart from it all.Unwanted.Roscoe may be crazy, but he is right, too.This world needs improving.A shudder runs through my body.Is it possible?It sounds like a make believe.Not something that could actually happen.And yet, part of me feels its possible.More than possible.Its then that I think were experiencing a groundquake.This close to the core, the results could be devastating.The books fall from the shelves and Roscoe huddles us under the doorway, where the structure is most stable.A low, slow horn whines.Whats happening?Livia asks.A group of four rebels charges right past us.Roscoe steps us back.Were under attack....Its my fault, I think.Hauser ...hes already here?Girls, Roscoe says, your time to make a choice has run out.If what youre saying is true, I say, uncertain, if all thats trueand Im not saying it isthen there is just one issue.What if we dont want to?What my sister wants to know, says Livia, is simply this: What if we choose not to be chosen?I do not think you will, says Roscoe.The alarms still whining, and we experience another groundquake, which I now realize is an explosion.Why not?For the simple fact that your mother is out there.And she is waiting for you.EPILOGUE           Livia   There are no crowds or well wishers.They are fighting for their lives.Theyre fighting for us.Just on the other side of the secret Rebel Base entrance, a squadron of PCFRock Bottom Patrol, Lex can hear, even from this distance, battling with rebels that have saved our lives, and changed them forever.Zaviers men have packed enough supplies for the four of us.There is little time to discuss plans; we must trust what has been drawn up in advance.I accept this easier than Lex does.Her guilt weighs heavy upon her.She was one of them once.Now?Its too early to say.Were as prepared as is humanly possible.Still, my body throbs with giddy unease.Just pretend were going to Paradise Island, says Kane.Lex is already ahead of us, leading the way to the hidden tunnel.She doesnt like the sight of us together.Our group is only four now.She will have to get used to it.This resistance wont stand forever.The PCF wont stop hunting us.But I will try and do as Kane says, as hard as that will be, even if I know there is no peace to be found there either.Another make believe.On our way to party with the Hubbies, thats all.Drink too much and lie in the sun.If you think that, then it will be easy.His smile is for my comfort.I feel something join the uneasy excitement.Something that, in all the planning, I have not felt until this moment, in the face of despair.Hope.Lex   I check my wrist monitor.Eighty feet to the entryway.Promise me you wont make rash decisions.Youll work with the team, Zavier says.Promise me, Lex.That you wont do anything crazy.Hes asking for promises I cant keep.He has none of his sisters charm or understanding.Hes a blunt force ...with the hands of a surgeon, I guess.There are complexities within us all.This journey to the Outlands will be a learning experience to us all.I can try, Zavier.Thats all I can do.He stares at me.Then, just for second, he does something I dont think Ive seen him do.He smiles.I smile back.No promises I wont kill him.Livia   Forty two more feet, she tells us.Her voice seems to travel past us and keep going, perhaps to the very end of the tunnel.There are some things that cannot be planned, I think.Some things for which you can never prepare.I have a sister now.She angers easily and is stubborn, possessive and reckless.She is my only family for now.She will grow to like me.Lex.Kane.Zavier.Before I met them, I thought I was doomed to be a Proper Young Failure.Now?I feel ready to be what Im meant to be.Lex   Twenty five more feet, I announce.Were almost there.I turn to look back at Livia.Shes already watching me like shes my protector, instead of the other way around.My sister.In the two days since weve met, she has tried to steal my only friend, because she is beautiful and arrogant.She is also a killer.There!says Zavier.Livia   A blazing beam of light now illuminates our path.We stop for a moment to gaze at it.The entrance to the hidden tunnel, I think, is this where our ancestors first tried to forge out of Lower Indra?And it is now the beginning of everything else.Lex & Livia Cosmo   Ready?Yes.Are you?I hope.We reach out in the dark and grasp hands.Together, we move toward the light.
