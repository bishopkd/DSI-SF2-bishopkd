The plan probably wouldnt work if Unmil nuked the spot, but there wasnt much that could be done about that.The engineers logic was sound for anything less than the worst scenario, and worrying about that when so many other problems needed to be dealt with was a waste of time.And time was getting more precious with every passing hour.They entered the bunkers access tunnel, its walls solidly reinforced with tree trunks laid on their sides and meshed together with barbed wire.It was all very slapdash in appearance, but Tora was familiar with that spec of wire, knowing that its tensile strength, cross section, and the design and placement of its barbs had been optimized for just that function.The logic was that, the more any nearby explosions shook the structure, the more those barbs would bury themselves into the wood and hold the bunkers structure together.As they reached the bunkers pre fabricated concrete heart, the colonel entered the tiny compartment reserved for the HQ commander and stowed his knapsack inside, and then he began to instruct his aides on how he wanted the War Room to be organized.By the time all tables, chairs, assorted placards, data screens and communications equipment had been positioned, the injured cadet was back, somewhat cleaner than before and with freshly dressed bandages.Sighing at the chore but conscious that soon he would have no time at all, the colonel received the boy in his newly furnished office.So, cadet, what is the problem?The cadet spoke slowly and carefully, laying out a story that surprised and shocked the old soldier.As he listened, Tora happened to remember the boys surname and was doubly surprised.Earthlings.I admit I wasnt even considering that possibility any more.But this is good news, I think.If they have pilots inside their Suits then our plans might just have the effect were hoping for.And the enemy nukes disabled two of their Suits.This is very useful information indeed, cadet.I thank you.But how did you lose that prisoner?The cadet continued with his story, and as he spoke the colonels eyes began to narrow.That part of the story was more unpleasant to listen to, rife as it was with war crimes, insubordination, mutiny and negligence, and with the assertion that some of that was presently on its way to Base Fido.Armed with the newfound information, the colonel wrote up a detailed report, keeping the young cadet seated beside him for occasional prods for information.Haven showed up shortly afterwards to quietly read the report from the screen.Its content was enough to elicit a whistle of admiration from the soldier.When can I be evacuated, sir?the cadet finally asked as they encrypted the report for sending.Next copter is fourteen minutes away and closing, the major rasped.Keep your pants on, boy, well get you out.The cadet thanked his seniors and left in a hurry, leaving the two men to sit quietly inside the cramped compartment, each immersed in his own thoughts.Is it just me, or was that boy just plain desperate to get the hell out of here?the major finally asked.Isnt just you.But dont forget the cadet who shot him is about twenty minutes off.Whats taking them so long?Apparently peeled away from the trail by mistake and had to forge a new path.Theyve got a seriously injured cadet with them.Apparently an amputee, and the legs no good for reattachment, its been separated from the body too long ...he observed grimly.Poor boy ...Girl.And young.Shit!Couldnt we have had the copter evacuate her?You know were prohibited from flying beyond this point with whats coming our way.The major gave his commander a look which told him precisely what he could do with that order.The pilots arent ours to order around, Tora defended.Weve gotta get us some of our own one of these days ...the major sulked.The officers returned to their duties until the distant rumble of rovers caught their attention.The revving engines intensified and then slowly died away.The officers looked at one another.Medical bay!the major declared.Driven by curiosity, the pair momentarily left matters in the lieutenant colonels hands and passed by medical bay, where the arriving rovers had finally rolled to a stop.The medical bay was located opposite from the Unmils expected axis of approach, the common wisdom being that men previously injured in combat probably wouldnt appreciate first class seats to the forthcoming battle.It bracketed the copterpad along with the war material deposit, the setup following a classic bullets and bandages philosophy.This allowed an incoming logistics copter to touch down with its most common cargo destinations only fifty meters away.The downside of that logic was that any missile strike against that deposit would probably leave the bay roofless at the very least.The world wasnt perfect, of course.The rovers rested unguarded beside the bays low set roof, its occupants loitering at the buildings entrance or already inside.The soldiery saluted the colonel smartly as he entered, their expressions grim.He heard screams from within one of the compartments.Thats my cue, he thought, and duly entered.The first thing he came upon was a naked leg cleanly cut a palm above its smooth knee, the limb having been discarded on a hospital cart like surplus gear.Petite foot, he thought, swallowing his horror.Its owner lay on an evac cart, thrashing about madly as orderlies tried to tie her down for transport.She was a beautiful thing even in her distress.Two soldiers leaned against the opposite wall, both of them as dirty as hogs in a sty.The male cadet, his bandages brown with dry blood and grime, kept his eyes fixed on the cadet as she screamed.As someone who came from a family of naturals, Tora had seen those eyes many times before.They were Sanpaku eyes.If one could see the whites of a mans eyes below their irises as well as beside them, those eyes were saying that their owner was at the end of his rope.It was the most telling sign of mental fatigue he had ever known.In a gesture of familiarity and comfort, the girl beside the cadet had her arm draped over his shoulders.Her serene demeanor said much about her mettle.He approached the pair and they straightened at his presence.At ease, he said, shaking their hands.Is this your comrade?he asked, turning towards the struggling figure.Yes, the girl replied.Laser did this to her.I see.Your name?Sergeant cadet Hannah Arakaki, sir  Arakaki?You wouldnt happen to know a Lieutenant colonel Dale Arakaki, would you?Her expression hardened a little before becoming impassive again.Yes, sir.Hes my uncle.Ah, yes, I would have expected greater similarities between the two ...Twice removed, sir, she added.The colonel smiled, liking her for disliking his second in command.He watched quietly as the orderlies finally managed to sedate the amputee and then turned to the boy.And you must be Toni Miura.The cadets three corner eyes fixed onto his seniors and held them unblinking for a while.The expression conveyed nothing, yet the colonel began to feel distinctly unsettled.Yes, I am, sir, the boy finally replied.I expect a cadet named Ian Templeton spoke to you, sir.Thats right, but lets not worry about that for now.The next copter is coming in within the next half hour to evacuate you three   I never said I wanted to leave, sir, the boy interrupted quietly, puzzling the colonel.I see ...The copter was leaving when we arrived.Tried to wave it down but it just kept going.I thought I saw Ian there, but Im not sure ...He was on the last copter, all right.As I said, all that can wait for later, first youll receive treatment and then youll be evacuated.I arrested him, he helped the prisoner escape ...and then Ray   Thats enough Toni, Hannah interrupted gently.The colonel doesnt need to know that now.Ill see to it that hes treated, sir, although what he says is true.Toni arrested Ian because he believes he helped a prisoner escape.The prisoner, Kaisers his name, then entered our camp and cut our mates throat.As the colonel heard her speak he slowly began to suspect that he had made a blunder.He had made that very same mistake more than thirty years ago, when he took the words of a soldier to be true without speaking to the other party involved.A sergeant had stood at court martial for that error, although thankfully there had been no conviction.He had promised himself he would never again be impregnated through his ears, as the saying went.Oh well, I did it again, he realized, and cursed his own foolishness.Turning to Dennis, he found the major observing him with an amused expression.His eyes appeared to be saying that it wasnt yet too late.Well, he decided, thinking hard, so youre not really interested in leaving, are you, Toni?The cadets eyes widened slightly, and then he gave a short nod.No sir.I faced one of these Suits personally, and I know none of you are ready for whats coming.Not entirely true, but Id appreciate your input anyway.With their more seriously injured patient temporarily out of the way, the orderlies began to focus on the task of addressing the cadets injuries.As he watched them work, marveling at the injuries and how they had already begun to knit back together by themselves, he received a call from his second in command.Colonel, the time you wanted?Youre not going to get it.The Unmil successfully captured one of the captains and has set off with him in hand.I suspect it has ceased harassing the companies and is returning to the trail, and I expect it will be arriving at Fido within the next four or five hours.I see, he breathed.I guess that was all for naught.Tell the boys to remote detonate, clump together and standby for evac.Standby for wha  EVAC!the colonel roared, angrier by the second.Do as I say.Ill take care of the rest.Understood?As soon as he was certain that the fool understood him, Tora turned to his old friend.Were about to get into some aggressive negotiations with the next copter pilot to arrive.I expect you to do your best, Dennis.You can expect the worst ...I mean, the best of me!the major answered with a sly grin.NINETEEN      Base Fido, Natures Day, 20th of June, 2771      The boy opened his eyes, startled by the gentle prod.Sorry for the rude awakening, boy, Tora said gently, but if I let you sleep youll miss all the fun.I have a few questions ...Still groggy after only two hours of sleep, the youth blinked and rubbed his eyes vigorously.Understood, sir.Ask away.Consulting the list they had compiled as the boy slept, he began to ask the questions, writing brief annotations of the answers as he did so.What had the Unmil pilot been wearing?What language had he spoken?Had he managed to observe the interior of the Unmil Suits interface cavity?Had there been a hydraulic interface of some kind?What weapons had it used?What were those weapons natures, rate of fire and destructive capabilities?How fast could the Suits run and for how long?Was there some insight as to their intentions?Had anything he or others had done managed to damage the Unmils armor?The boy answered all questions more articulately and in greater detail than Tora would have expected, his brow furrowing occasionally as he thought hard or tried to remember some detail of the preceding days.The information he provided was more much detailed than Ians, and the colonel was greatly surprised by the fact that the boy had actively sought his enemy out and engaged him while armed with what was clearly outdated weaponry.Unlike with Ian, there were no soft whispers in his mind as he wondered at the speakers motivations, courage or honesty.The Miura boy was easy to read, and he was possessed of a natural aggressiveness that the colonel greatly admired.The cadet probably hadnt yet realized how unusual his behavior had been, nor how risky.That gave him a thought.Grew up on a farm, did we?he asked.The boys eyes widened slightly and his head turned to the side like a curious hound, the question catching him unawares.Tora grinned and tried hard not to laugh.Y yes, sir.Ahuh, pretty obvious.Sir, may I ask a question?Go ahead.After the number Ive asked you deserve one yourself.Why hasnt Sueli been evacuated yet?Sorry about that, but we had to divert that copter to evacuate comrades from the Dogspine.With the wind rising and the enemy between us and them, our window of opportunity is closing.All non essential personnel will be evacuated from here over the next two hours and shell be among the first to leave.What happens after those two hours?You know what will happen.The boys expression first became pained and then thoughtful.I saw those Hammerheads beyond on a dirt road.Is MEWAC here?I need to report to them.Those are EWAC Suits.MEWACs in bits and pieces out on Lograins airfield, awaiting evac to Leiben.You should be with them, and since youve already answered me as best you could, you soon will be.Especially since you have a sliver of poison on its way there.Theres something not quite right with that boy, is there?Sir, thats one way to put it.His minds a mystery to me, but he is dangerous.That much I know for sure.EWAC, right?Is there any chance theyd loan me a Suit?The colonel smiled.Loan an injured cadet from another outfit an operational Suit?I think not.Pity.I think I know how to kill it.The colonels eyebrows began to rise at the bold statement.Care to explain how?Something the Suits doing is causing our weapons to fail, making them not work the way they were made to.But a few days ago I saw a hammerhead drop a grenade as it retreated, and it detonated below the Unmil and sent it flying.That seemed to shake it up a bit.So I thought; if a small, well placed grenade can do that, just imagine    what a bigger bomb can do, right?the colonel finished for him.A sort of mega mine, am I right?he added.Not quite, sir.Mines can certainly do some damage but their effectiveness depends on the enemy getting close enough.Maybe it will, or maybe it will find some other way around.What I think is, all Lasers are direct line of sight weapons, right?But grenades are by their nature indirect fire weapons.And this terrain must have some sweet spots where units may hide behind cover and do some serious throwing.So I was thinking that satchel charges could be improvised and thrown   ...and shot down by those Lasers automatic firing capability.That   No.There is no automatic fire capability if the Suits on its back.I discovered that when I fired on Kaisers Suit as it was lying on the ground that time.My missiles werent powerful enough to get the job done, but heavy satchel charges thrown at it while its incapacitated will get through and do serious damage, I think.Those mines would be useful if they could be remote detonated, though.Then it doesnt have to step on them; the shock wave alone would be enough to make the Suit hit the deck, and then our Suits could finish up.The missing element to Dennis plan suddenly slid into place.They had only gotten as far as the remote detonated minefield that EWAC was emplacing over the bases south eastern perimeter.Until then he had been betting on the possibility that the Suit would happen to wander close enough to one to get the grand prize, but here was a chance to elevate the kill probability to something respectable.Dennis unglued his back from the prefabricated wall and peered at them with a smile.Looks like were gonna need to do a little more of that combined arms crap, he rasped.The colonel turned to the boy.Incidentally, hows your throwing arm?he asked.Im a leftie, sir.Its just fine, the boy replied, death in his eyes.The colonel liked what he saw there.*****      Colonel Brunn Pienaar grinned from ear to ear as he listened, nodding curtly every time a particular point was made.The commander of EWAC appeared to be anything but an engineer, and Tora liked that about him.He was also game for the audacious plan.That sounds awesome!You know, every time EWAC goes on campaign you people never seem to know what to do with us.Usually you guys think were here to dig you a bunch of trenches, right?But we are a combat arms by our own right; we even fight as infantry or armor if theres no alternative.And now there is no alternative.What about the cadets request?We can do that.Two of our Suits are on their asses; their drivers popped their fuses and have already been evacced to Lograin.He can take one, and if you have someone else trained to drive a Suit, he can take the other.Tora knew of one other, and made a mental note to ask for her assistance.Nodding to Pienaar, he bid his counterpart a momentary farewell and set off with his vice commander in tow.Making a decision, he turned to Dale.Do you know a young woman by the name of Hannah Arakaki?The lieutenant colonel appeared surprised by the question.Indeed I do.And do you know where she is?Well, I presume shes still grinning like an idiot at her fathers manse.At least, thats what she was doing the last time we met.The colonel pursed his lips.Well, thats not quite up to date ...he remarked, and then he explained.Oh lord ...Arakaki exhaled, struck mute for a moment.His face then began to harden.Where is she?he asked through gritted teeth.Before I answer, Id like to make something clear.She may be your niece or thereabouts, but shes MEWAC personnel first in my ledger.And as you may already have noticed, I wasnt born with a silver spoon stuck up my ass, so I dont care much about aristocrats special dealings with one another.If I need to use her, I wont hesitate to give the order.And if you resist me on this Ill have you in cuffs and out of the way, seeing as up to now youve been about as much use to me as a well trained monkey.And you wont be evacced either; youll sit in a room until were either victorious or smears on the ground.Understood?Understood, he replied, his cold eyes saying, however, that he didnt understand at all.The colonel sighed.Shes in medical bay, sleeping in one of the cots.Wake her gently, alright?Shes had a bad week.But the lieutenant colonel was already on his way.It was difficult, sometimes, deciding on the right thing to do.He could have kept his mouth shut about the cadet, but his old habit of keeping his closest subordinates in the loop had taken over, and suddenly there was one more variable to consider.Sighing at his own foolishness, he gave Dennis his orders and set off to medical bay again.His fears were laid to rest as soon as medical came into view.Tora crossed paths with Dale as the lieutenant colonel marched in the opposite direction, alone and with a redness in his cheeks that the crimson sun could not entirely explain.He didnt raise his eyes, preferring instead to curse the cadet hed just left in a way that no family member rightly should.Tora smiled and entered the building.He found the girl sitting stiffly on the cot she had been sleeping in, her arms just as crossed as her legs were.She turned her eyes towards him, and he momentarily saw her wrath there.What in the hell are they feeding cadets these days?he wondered as he put on an apologetic smile.My apologies, Sergeant cadet, but I wasnt aware of the family feud until I had spoken the words.Although Ive come to find this current generation of soldiers tends to resolve their family disputes by running off to the army.With due respect, Colonel, I didnt run off, she objected.I am here with my fathers blessing.As for the rest of the family, they were not a factor in this decision, nor will they ever be despite their foolish ideas.Sorry, but I am not here to meddle in your personal affairs.What I am doing here is offering you and Sergeant cadet Miura the chance to participate in an act of divine vengeance.Are you game?he asked with a wolfish grin.The cadet slowly unthawed, and she uncrossed her arms as the full weight of the proposal came to her attention.We ...we can kill it?she asked uncertainly, her blue eyes darting towards the compartment door beyond which Toni rested.You can try.There are two Hammerhead Suits that EWAC will be making available for you, although the only weapons youll be using are still being put together by their personnel.They have six drivers who have never dealt with this thing before, so I have some expectations from your side.Get it?Got it, sir, she replied, licking her lips.You are to get off your rears and meet up with the EWAC section right now.You can find them two hundred meters further up the road.Theyre expecting you, so dont waste their time.He turned to leave and then changed his mind.Turning once more to the cadet he gave a parting shot.And tell that Miura something for me.His situation with the Templeton boy will be infinitely improved if he manages to kill the Unmil.That bakemonos destruction could make the difference between a medal and a firing squad.Understood?Y yes, sir.Good ...he smiled his thanks and set off once more, mentally thanking Dale for being an idiot.There was nothing more dangerous than a highly motivated soldier, and he felt he now had two instead of just one.The next jaunt in his preparations took him to the war materials deposit on the copterpads opposite side, where EWAC personnel worked on the improvised weapons to be used in the coming engagement.The deposit was made up of three separate compartments that curved around a common area.The first was a small room dedicated to assorted detonators and fusing systems for EWAC personnel, whilst a larger had been dedicated to small and medium caliber ammunition for the ROWAC force, along with hand grenades and anti armor munitions.The largest compartment, however, housed the astonishing consignment of explosives that had been dedicated to the construction of the path and the setting of booby traps.Several tables positioned at the center of the common area were surrounded by combat engineers, and soldiers kept entering and leaving the largest compartment, carrying heavy brown sacks over their shoulders.Those sacks were being fitted into large backpacks while the remaining personnel installed the fusing systems.A captain who was overseeing the operation approached him and saluted, proving to be yet another EWAC captain whom Tora wasnt familiar with.Sir, Captain Van Dyke, Sir.I command the Fortification Section, sir.FORTSEC, right.Thats the name of your Hammerhead section, isnt it?Yessir.Im overseeing the preparation of the charges, sir.Drop the sirs, alright Captain?You dont want you to tire yourself out before the fighting begins.But I would like you to give me an idea of how these charges work, if you dont mind.Momentarily miffed at the colonels comment, the captain nevertheless showed the frog swallowing talent inherent to an officer and guided the colonel to the nearest table.DIMEs.Short for Dense Inert Metal Explosives.Were taking sacks filled with a granular explosive charge of octogen and fitting them into these travel packs   Who did the travel packs originally belong to?the colonel interrupted, throwing the captain off his explanation.Uh, we had to commandeer them from all EWAC personnel, sir, he replied before grimacing at having once again sirred his superior.Some men simply failed to realize how much they entertained others with their antics.The colonel kept a serious face and shook his head in concern.That must have caused some serious problems, didnt it, Captain?Oh yes, it did, the captain replied with a pained expression.Even had some trouble convincing a few of the more senior corporals to hand them over.Horrible indeed.And what did you do with all their personal effects?Well, sir.Um, we sort of overturned the packs onto a flatbed and sealed it.Ahuh.I wouldnt want to be nearby when they try and sort out what belongs to whom afterwards.What do you think?The captains face was dead serious.Neither would I.  Therell be blood for sure.Try as he might, the colonel was unable to keep the smile off his face.Clapping the soldier on his shoulder, he continued with the matter at hand.Alright then, whats a DIME?Theyre explosive charges filled with very fine tungsten powder.Doing that gives the charge less brisance but more pushing power per square centimeter of surface area.Also good for seriously damaging any ocular devices within its range.Are all the charges made that way?No, sir.Were rigging about half of the packs with DIMEs and lacing a blue cord to the fusing system to distinguish them from the more conventional charges.Conventional as in conventional explosives?Yessir.The remainder have only octogen as its main charge.Their cord is red, sir.Whered you get the cords?Theyre actually armbands, our boys like to carry them to recognize each other in combat.Blue is for the Mobility Company and red for the Counter mobility boys.Understood.Just give me a moment to observe, he finally told the captain.After a few minutes, the colonel began to understand the methodology.The travel packs were fitted with an eleven kilo mass sack of explosives at its base.A hand grenade, which a separate team had modified by cutting away its handling lever, was then placed upon the sack and a length of nanowire snapped onto its grenade pin.The nanowire was then threaded through two more sacks as they were also fitted into the pack, before finally being clipped to an armband of the appropriate color on the opposite side.The packs cover was then closed and carefully sealed with duct tape, with the armband sticking out of the orifice meant for its water tube.The end result was an explosive device of about 34 kilo mass for a red cord and 56 kilo mass for a blue cord.You think the travel packs will stand up to a Suits handling?Easily, Colonel.Theyre tough, they were designed to provide some protection against flack.Thats why we wanted them so bad, the captain replied.And the fusing system is reliable?We tested it with a partially deactivated grenade and sacks of soil.We finally got a fuse to pop after a good yank.The Suits are easily strong enough to pull the grenade pin right out of the pack, but the damage to the sacks isnt going to affect their ability to detonate.The tests also made us realize the only way to get it to pull reliably was to tighten the sacks inside their pack as much as possible.That way the grenades length is perpendicular to the pull direction, since its being pressed between the sacks.Hence the duct tape, sir.Nice.How many charges?Depends, sir.Depends on when the Unmil arrives, mostly.The completed charges are soon going to be stacked outside along the deposits wall.We expect at least fifty within the next hour.If that doesnt get the job done, nothing will ...the colonel thought aloud.The captain remained quiet for a moment, before the need to speak overcame him.Sir, what are the chances of these charges being effective against the Unmil?Sincerely?Im a little upset that our travel packs arent a bit more spacious.The captain looked discouraged.Sighing, Tora decided to throw him a bone.Listen, Captain.Two MEWAC cadets who survived the debacle at the mines are on their way to your drivers.Theyve both had personal experience regarding whats coming our way, and if you want more information regarding your enemy, then Miuras the one to talk to.Youre also going to be their commanding officer for the coming engagement.They volunteered to drive your two unoccupied Suits.Understood?Understood, sir, the captain quietly answered.Van Dyke kept the colonel company for the following five minutes as they inspected the weapons assembly until, hurriedly excusing himself, the captain left for the dirt road.The colonel had a suspicion the officer was on a mission to find the cadets.Abandoning the deposit, the old colonel made his way back to his bunker, where he found a sulking Dale staring at a map.I dont want to talk about it, the lieutenant colonel said without raising his head.Good.I dont want to hear about it, the colonel answered cheerfully.Your majors back from the frontline.He decided to pull your entire complement of praetorians and pile them on the northern and southern shoulders of the Dogspine.Good.I told him to.He also decided to remark the map using your user profile.Good.I told him to.You might have been kind enough to tell me to do that!he suddenly barked.And I would have, Tora calmly replied, had you not shown greater interest in arguing with your niece.Do you understand the reason for my orders?Dale rubbed his eyes tiredly.Yes.I guess you pulled the bots so theyd be out of FORTSECs way, but left them in a position where they can still harass the Unmil to their hearts desire.Correct.And the maps will shortly be uploaded to FORTSEC and redirected to their Suits, thus allowing them to know the minefields location, as well as their ideal defensive positions based on terrain curvature.Dennis, how is our minefield?Up but not yet running, Haven replied from his bench outside the commanders compartment, rubbing his knees as he spoke.Theyre unrolling and camouflaging the lead wires back here to Command.Pienaar apparently wants to use our bunker as his base of fire.And hes welcome to it, Tora replied.Itll save us the trouble of comm difficulties and lag time.It also puts both EWAC and ROWAC commanders in the same spot of a combat theatre, in plain violation of Army doctrine, Dale interjected, forcing the colonel to do a moments thought.Ill allow it, Tora finally decided.Doctrine is not absolute, and it is certainly better to have two commanders in a hardened bunker than one outside of it, especially if the missions chances of success increase as a result.Tora took advantage of the time to inform them of the deposits state of preparations, and of Tonis and Hannahs recruitment to FORTSEC.The lieutenant colonel simply shook his head when he heard of the development, and prudently refrained from voicing his opinion on the matter.Over the course of the following hour, the diverse elements of their plan began to click into place.Exceeding their initial expectations, a hundred pack charges had been improvised and transported to their expected locations of use via flatbed trucks.Aside from the four Hammerheads that had remained at the frontline to assist in mine emplacement, the remainder had, after unexplained delay, finally settled into their initial positions along the entire front.More than a hundred lead wires had been laid and camouflaged, converging on the carefully disguised Command bunker and feeding into an EWAC control console, where a simple switching system would allow remote detonation of any of the hundred and three improvised landmines at a moments notice.From the ROWAC side of things, all preparations had also been completed.After careful consideration, the old colonel had decided to remove from combat all bots not tasked to the anti armor role and elected to evacuate them on foot to Lograin.This left the cramped heights that flanked their chosen frontline bristling with bot anti armor teams, their rockets having proven to be ineffective, yet still hopefully capable of providing a lethal distraction for their enemy.Also nestled into the mountain face and expertly camouflaged were two remote camera sensors, providing secure video and audio feed via electronically shielded cables.Those cameras were ROWACs eyes in the field and their location provided ideal overwatch over the entire frontline.All that remained was to wait as all systems were checked and rechecked, and the colonel took advantage of the time to send an update to Lograin, taking care to detail how the MEWAC cadets had been debriefed and recycled into FORTSEC.He tried not to overdo the report, conscious that to do so would be to take a departure from impartiality that could later bite him in the rear.Colonel, Lograin reports one of its drones has been destroyed over Fido.Our guests apparently not far off.Tora gave up writing his report and entered the war room, pausing to take a good, long look at the video streaming in before taking his seat at the head of the table.To his right sat Colonel Pienaar, who was junior to him, and to his left was Dale.The only other sitter was Pienaars vice commander, a lieutenant colonel with a name so complicated that hed settled on calling him comrade for the time being.The remaining officers and aides mostly stood to accommodate their number in the cramped quarters, Dennis having barely managed to commandeer a spot of real estate to place his stool.Has there been anything of note on our images?he asked no one in particular.Nothing, sir, a captain answered.Contact Lograin and get the precise hour their bird got shot down.Then check our infrared feed at that hour   That wont be necessary, sir ...the captain interrupted.There was something strange about the way he said it, and the colonel quickly followed his gaze to the live feed displayed on a separate screen.There in color, in the forefront of a grove of trees reaching to spaulder level, stood an armored Suit, as static as a statue and as great as a god.At first he thought it was his imagination, but as the moment passed he became certain.Its helm was swiveling slowly, slowly, as if surveying the terrain before it.Transmit the feed to Lograin, the colonel whispered, as if the Suit would somehow hear him if he spoke loudly enough.The image was pixelated and the screens palette of color was somewhat pastel, but he still noticed something resting upon its breastplate, and it   It suspects something ...the major quipped from his stool, causing the entire room to wince at his loudness.The Suit continued to slowly observe its surroundings and Toras anxiety rose, knowing full well that the nearest mines were only tens of meters away.He leaned towards Pienaar.Whats the nearest mine?A17.Were already ahead of you.It needs only take a few steps forward and well send the fucker back into orbit.The Suit continued to slowly turn its helm until finally it faced forwards and ceased to move entirely.A full minute passed by, making it clear to Tora that the Unmil would not be easy prey.The ground before it suddenly bloomed up and outwards, filling the entire screen, the vision quickly followed by a tremendous shudder that shook the bunker violently enough to rattle the logs against one other.Sir.Mines A16, A17 and A18 have detonated simultaneously!he heard an EWAC captain shout.Whats the meaning of this?!Pull the image out!Get a fix on that Suit!Tora ordered, shouting to make himself heard above the noise.Tora ...Pienaar stated simply, showing him the pen key he still held in his hand, the one that he had been about to insert into the com con to initiate the nearest mine.If it wasnt you ...the colonel breathed.He turned to his comms officer, and the lieutenant answered his question before he had a chance to ask it.Strong electromagnetic interference emanating from the contact since the first moment of detonation, sir.It sent out a pulse    and the inducing effect was enough to force a current through the nearest lead wires and into their detonators!Pienaar exclaimed.The cameras had zoomed out but the dust cloud was gigantic and filled their screens.Turning again to his comms officer, he ordered the man to contact FORTSEC.The lieutenant turned to his EWAC counterpart, who simply shook his head.Comms disabled due to enemy interference, sir.Incoming!someone suddenly barked.The missile shot through the dust cloud and streaked off screen in a fraction of a second.A moment later the bunker ceiling partly caved in as a tremendous shock wave struck the fortification.Barbed wire snaked and coiled along the logs, making tearing sounds Toras concussed mind could barely register, until a loud snapping sound punctuated the abrupt end of his life.TWENTY      Base Fido, Natures Night, 21st of June, 2771      Toni gave the Hammerhead a long, hard look, the problem before him having finally presented itself.There was no orifice for opening the titans breastplate, and its large and heavy frame made plain to him what he hadnt considered when accepting the colonels proposal; the Hammerhead was an entirely different species from the Moca Suit, and he simply hadnt the training or experience to operate it.He didnt, in fact, even know how to access its interface cavity.You gonna keep screwing it with your eyes?Get in, rook, Jonah ordered as she stowed her gear in a plastic duffel bag, her travel packs fate having already been tragically sealed.Theres just one problem, corporal.How do I get inside?She paused in the midst of her activities and remained there for a while, taking the remark in and slowly realizing what it implied.She had been on the juice for a while, and her jaw bulged before it met her ears in a very masculine way, a trait in stark contrast to her full lips and feminine pose.How in the hell wouldnt you know?she asked bitingly.Ive only ever been trained in the Moca.Never drove a Hammerhead before.So the Suit you faced the Unmil with ......Was a Moca, yes.Fucking rooks!she exclaimed angrily as she shook her shaved skull.Youre missing an arm and havent the slightest idea of how to get into a Hammerhead, much less dri  He has a very good idea how to drive a hammer ...Park interrupted, oblivious to the drama.Thats what the Mocas for, dont you remember?The man had enough muscle on him to make Jonah look scrawny, but Toni had quickly realized that he possessed the more moderate disposition between the two EWAC corporals.Toni had also become conscious of the fact that his being a sergeant cadet carried absolutely no weight with either, his unofficial rank of rook having promptly relegated him to a category below human.You need the appropriate pen key, rook, yours just wont do, Park informed the cadet levelly.There was something about the man, probably the wide lion like interval between his Korean eyes, that made Toni want to turn away.But he didnt, giving him a firm nod instead.How do I get one?The corporal smiled.You simply use the one your predecessor left behind when he stroked out, he replied, tossing the device to a surprised Toni.Sorry bout that.Didnt know he was dead.Dead?Oh no, the dickheads alive enough, but hes probably not going to have it easy for a while.You better learn from his mistake.If you tighten your straps too much and keep hard at it for long enough without rest, once you loosen them again you might be sending a blood clot on its way to your thinker.Understood?Yes, sir.Where do I insert it?Up its ass, of course.No, no, Im just kidding, cadet, leave that alone.Theres no insert for your pen key; you just touch the stick against one of its oculars and infrared comms will do the rest.The user manuals in a compartment in the cavitys left flank.Give it a quick read through, but focus on the customizable settings, cause youre probably going to have to make some in stride adjustments.The moment Toni touched the pen key against the bowed helms left ocular there was a swoosh of hydraulics, and the thoraxs access doors opened before him like twin petals, exposing what was by his standards a very spacious interior.His view of its hydraulic interface was partly obscured by a wide sternum the access doors locked into when they shut, and as he clambered onto the titans kneepad he became aware of its impressive thickness.The doors themselves, which when closed constituted about the only frontal armor he could reasonably expect to protect him, proved to be of even greater thickness, and a side view made it clear to him that they were laminated, spaced and well backed.Awesome.Your diapers, rook!Toni heard from behind.Expecting literal diapers, he turned to find Jonah offering him several new Scopolamine patches.Taking them from her outstretched hand, he thanked her, only to have her sniff disapprovingly and turn away.The patches were thicker than he was used to, and he realized they were meant for five day jaunts.He almost wished they had been diapers.Almost.The Hydraulic interface appeared much sleeker than that of the Mocas, with its wires and piping conveniently secured and protected in adhesive cable organizers, and the suits strapping system was much sturdier, having apparently been conceived for aggressive maneuvering.And so the old problem arose once more; the tighter the fit, the more precise the interface was, but the greater the chances of constriction of the circulatory system.Toni remembered Kaisers uniform, and of how it had appeared to possess a thin layer of some protective liquid beneath it.They seemed to be on the right track there.Finding his predecessors spare uniform jammed into the compartment Park had referred to, Toni pulled it on over his own in the hope that the straps constrictive effect would somehow lessen that way, feeling only stiffness in his arm where days ago he had felt pain.He then removed the pristine user manual from its plastic wrapping, leaned against the cavitys tilted floor and began to do some heavy reading.It wasnt long before he realized his initial impressions of the Suit had been wrong; the Hammerhead had apparently been conceived to more closely emulate human maneuverability, and as a result it relied on more than just germane as its pneumatic gas of choice.Germane was apparently also known as germanium hydride, and above a certain temperature it decomposed into amorphous germanium and hydrogen gas.The hydrogen was then recycled and stored in a separate tank for use in powering a significant portion of the Suits artificial muscles.Thus germane was employed in slow twitch PAMs for greater power due to its high gaseous density, while hydrogen was employed in fast twitch PAMs for greater speed due to its high fluidity, and the ratio of G to H could be decreased by passing the gas through a resistance and storing the resulting solid.The Suit possessed two different types of CAT, as well as a specialized compartment between them intended to store all excess germanium.Also within that compartment was an apparatus that manufactured germane gas by extracting Hydrogen from one tank, heating it in the presence of the amassed solid, and depositing the final product in the other.It was known as a GH reactor, and its activity was closely linked to the battery of compressors that partly encircled it.Among the first in stride adjustments he would soon be expected to make was to follow the OSs instructions, maneuvering the Suit until the ideal ratio of slow to fast twitch PAMs could be calculated, as well as their precise locations in the general muscle structure.It was all fairly impressive, but Toni could only remember how easily the MEWAC Suits had exploded into crimson flames that day at the mines.Germane burns with a bright red flame, he reminded himself.Peering once more at the interface cavity above and around him, Toni tried to memorize its interior.Its almost spherical wall was well padded with square panels of beige colored foam and, aside from reinforced tubing that snaked up the HINTs articulated support crane and into the roof, was entirely devoid of the innards hed become accustomed to seeing inside the Moca.The crane itself possessed some padding of its own around its sharper corners, although its hydraulic cylinders, much more robust in section and length than their equivalents in the Moca, were still plainly visible to his admiring eyes.A few panels were bordered in bright orange, and their centers were covered in writing that explained what could be accessed behind it; RIGHT DOOR HYDRAULIC NODE  DO NOT CUT, GENERAL ELECTRICAL GRID  RISK OF ELECTROCUTION, DANGER  LIVE WEAPON INSIDE, among others.The only exception consisted of a small transparent panel inside of which was a pen key insert and the door controls.Hey there, Mr.Tardy!an ecstatic voice sounded from below, causing Toni to smile.Hey there yourself, Happyface!So, do you like your new partner?True to her handle, Hannah beamed up at him from between the titans kneepads, clearly exhilarated at the state of the art war maker she had just been handed.Youre my new partner.Didnt you know?she quipped, causing him to blush.Her happy face momentarily became serious.Toni, I know what the colonel said about sorting out that business with Ian, but thats no reason to go berserk out there.Remember what Baylen keeps saying ...The Pair is the armys smallest unit, I know, he replied seriously.I dont have any plans to die today, Hannah.Hannah was about to say something else, but an EWAC captains sudden arrival cut her short.Cadet Miura?Please come down, he ordered curtly.Toni clambered down from his unit and approached the captain uneasily.Not bothering to salute due to not having donned an appropriate head covering, he stood instead at attention before the officer and awaited recognition.At ease, cadet, lets leave formalities aside.And, Arakaki, you stay too.I have a few questions to ask, and I need them answered within the hour.Uh, sir, Ive been doing a lot of that today, I dont know what else to say.Listen.These Unmils, theyre humans, right?What are they like?What are they here for?Before Toni could answer, Park appeared and warned the captain that Command was waiting on them to deploy.Irritably waving the corporal away, the perspiring captain focused on the cadet before him once more, apparently not caring in the least for his superiors order of operations.The senior corporal gave his commanding officer a long, expressionless stare before finally departing for his unit.Sir, they are definitely human.One of them is already dead, so they can most definitely be killed, and theyre not adapted to our planets gravity or atmosphere like we are.And if I didnt get it wrong, theyre basically here to annex Capicua to Earth, and theyve no problem in wiping out our capital to get it done, sir.Theyre not willing to compromise, then?At all?he asked tensely.I dont think they really need to, sir ...he replied, beginning to doubt the officers nerve.Right ...the captain declared with a skyward glance.Toni tried to reassure the captain, but the officer cut him short and ordered them to Suit up and run through the setup sequence.He could see the alarm on Hannahs face as they turned to their units, but he suddenly remembered something that caused him to turn once more.Sir?We dont know our call signs yet ...The captain took a long while to think on it before finally answering.Right, youre Digger Three and the others is Digger Five.Youll stay paired up with Park like your predecessor was, and Five will be with Jonah.Sir, Id prefer to   Youd prefer nothing, cadet!Im not pairing up a couple of rookies with no walking experience an hour before combat!Get to your Suits!he roared, scaring the notion out of Tonis mind like a bat from a twilit cave.Yessir!he hollered and snapped about smartly, earning himself a stifled snort of laughter from his fellow cadet.Accelerating to a jog, Toni leapt upon a buckled kneepad and into the cavitys lobby, pausing to hurriedly insert the pen key into its slot, seal the doors and stow the manual before finally laying his back snugly against the HINT.He then carefully inserted one leg at a time into the device, strapping both securely in before doing the same with his arms, and lastly with his abdominal and thoracic bindings.After checking his straps carefully for their tightness, he pulled down and donned the light weight helmet and facemask.Activate Suit!he ordered.The graphic display made him feel like he had just fast forwarded a full century, and when he ordered outside visual the image quality left Toni almost immersed in his surroundings.The foreground display prompts were comparatively streamlined, but their organization greatly resembled the Mocas and he quickly initiated the customization process.Hannahs Digger Five, which had only moments ago been kneeling on his left side, was already beginning to move and, not wishing to retain his notorious handle, Toni rushed through the ocular calibration and ordered biomechanical diagnostics to initiate.Initiating bio diagnostics, his sisters sweet voice began.Your full cooperation is fundamental for successful calibration.Please stand!Armored gauntlets pressed against Digger Threes left kneepad as he heaved upwards, and he felt the HINT straps pressing against his extremities and shoulders as the devices hydraulic interface fought his effort to stand.Moments later he was ordered to return to position one and then, once again, to stand.The second effort proved easier.He followed the computers instructions very diligently over the entire process, fully aware that, although the OS was conceived to keep a running diagnostic on its driver and update its settings accordingly, he would probably find himself in the midst of battle before his ideal ratio had been reached.Here Digger Prime, Diggers inform romeo conditions, over.As the silence stretched out Toni began to wonder whether he was supposed to be the first to sound off.A crackling voice corrected him of the thought.Here Digger Two, romeo conditions fine, Parks calm voice hailed over the comm.Here Digger Three, conditions fine, Toni reported cautiously.Here Digger Four, comm fine, Jonah reported.Here Digger Five, romeo comms fine, Hannah sounded enthusiastically.Toni smiled and peered to his left, where Hannahs Digger Five was on its pads and eagerly flexing its upper appendages.He prayed her armor would hold, but as he did so an image of Sueli hugging her severed leg momentarily flashed before his eyes, earning him a warning from his OS as it registered the brief palpitation of his heartbeat.Form a single column behind my units position, Digger Prime ordered, and a Hammerhead that strode south easterly on the dirt road lifted its massive gauntlet skywards, its index digit protruding.All units walked and took up positions on the leading Diggers rearguard, and Toni marveled at the fresh fluidity of his movements.Had he not strapped himself in only moments before, he mightnt have believed that he was currently encased in a HINT.He had barely taken up position behind Digger Two before they were off at marching speed.One and a half kilometers further on, after having passed by the deposit and then a Command Bunker surrounded by decoys, wiring and camouflage nets, the column finally arrived at the point where the path and frontline intersected.To their left was an improvised staging area where armored Suits loitered among several flat bed trucks, and where pack charges had been laid out on the ground as if in formation, eight columns of twelve or thirteen devices each.Digger Prime then had the entire section huddle and instructed them on the nature and function of their new weapons, before giving them the opportunity to do practice throws with duffel bags packed with the appropriate weight in rocks.And so, after fifteen minutes worth of practice, where the Suits settled into opposite sides of the clearing to launch their improvised practice grenades at one other, all Diggers were finally permitted to snap on lower torso webbing and attach their charges securely to it.Tonis allotted grenades consisted of twelve of the rigged travel packs, six of them red cords.You know, I think I just got my own travel pack handed back to me ...Toni heard Park mutter over their private comm channel.Dont despair, Two, if you leave it for last you might not need to toss it, he shot back, and was rewarded with a chuckle and accusations of being an optimist.Shortly after, Tonis OS privileged him with an up to date virtual map of the surrounding area, and all titans momentarily stopped whatever they were doing as their drivers studied the chart, taking special note of the minefields location and of their designated starting points.FORTSEC, take your positions, Digger Prime finally ordered.Encumbered with the four charges that Toni hadnt managed to strap on to his webbing, Digger Three strode towards his designated spot, situated only a few dozen meters north of the path and behind a bump in the terrain.The remaining Hammerheads also dispersed to their locations, some raising their closed gauntlets in salutation to each another, all appearing pregnant due to their protruding payloads.Studying the map again, Toni realized that Diggers Two, Three, Seven and Eight bracketed the path where it became MEWACs axis of retreat, the remaining Suits having been dispersed along the front in much lower density.His hair crawled as he suddenly realized what that meant.Some brain in the bunker had probably realized that the Unmil would appear while following that axis, and had decided to place his most senior or combat experienced assets at its flanks.Which put Toni smack in the expected center of action yet again.The coward in him sighed tremulously and, getting down on a kneepad, he compulsively surveyed his unstrapped weapons.Having decided to favor mobility, Toni had clipped the six lighter reds and two blues onto his lower torso, which left him with four DIME charges for the initial ambush, after which he would have to make do with whatever he could easily carry in hand and webbing.And he knew the enemy Suit would probably not remain still long enough for all four devices to be thrown.He also disliked the charges lightness of weight, finding himself disappointed that the travel packs hadnt more space for explosives.The thought gave him an idea.He clipped the packs two to two and, unpocketing one of the oversized rolls of duct tape the engineers appeared to carry on their Suits at all times, he reinforced the union and then overlapped the blue armbands extremities from opposite ends, bonding them together.As he proudly surveyed the product of his labor, his private comm panel blinked on once more.Whatcha doin there, pilgrim?Park apparently had a thing for the legendary American west.There probably wont be time to lob all our excess charges, so Im preparing double whammies.Of course you realize you havent drilled to throw anything that heavy ...Toni shook his head, the act emulated by his Suits hammerhead as the OS processed the data from his helmets gyroscope.From what I noticed in our session, those duffel grenades weighed in between a redcord and a bluecord, and varied a lot between them.Added to that, I couldnt even throw with full force, every time I did that the duffels would tear or hit the trees on the other side.So Id say I havent been drilled in throwing any real grenades anyway, so I dont care.All I know is that I dont like leaving grenades behind, and this way the first detonations will be felt.He was met by silence, although twenty meters away and behind a dense growth of trees, he heard the sound of duct tape being deployed.Smiling to himself, Toni decided to also pair up the charges he had strapped on, the task taking him the best part of ten minutes before all was finally done and returned to place.He then gripped a pair of blue cord packs in his considerable gauntlet and began to burn the time until contact.His position had been wisely chosen, not only because the curvature of the terrain favored concealment, but also because the tall trees that grew there offered shade to the entire area, diminishing several detection factors simultaneously.All that was left was for him to minimize the remaining and most important detection factor of all.Movement.Statically he awaited the Unmils arrival, scanning the treetops to the south east for any movements not windborne as his active mind, starved of the nootropics it had become accustomed to, tried not to wander.Trying also to gain some situational awareness, Toni studied the map and attempted to correspond what he saw there to the landmarks surrounding him.His eyes soon fell on the minefield, which began a hundred and fifty meters further on and was a good hundred deep.What he saw there made him groan.One couldnt reasonably have expected the engineers to emplace two hundred and forty one tons of explosives, in over a hundred different locations and within the course of a few hours, and have simultaneously expected them to camouflage them effectively.The ground was smooth and appeared untrodden, for sure, but it hadnt been covered with vegetation and the sappers solution had apparently been to spread the excess dirt over the entire area.It was an understandable thing to do, since that way the precise location of each mine was a mystery, but if his enemy possessed any similarity to Kaiser at all, he would certainly find an alternative path around.A sudden loud snap in the distance caught his attention and his body tensed brusquely in its interface, causing his Suit to shudder slightly.Sorely tempted to break the radio silence that had been ordered almost an hour ago, he decided instead to lower his profile and sharpen his eyes.You see something?Park suddenly asked from his position on loudspeaker.Cant see shit with these trees in my face.Taking a moment to first moderate his loudspeakers volume, Toni answered him in a low voice.Nothing.But something might have fallen from the sky.Im seeing a streak of smoke up there.Pretty far away, though.Ahuh.I see it.Cant be it, too fresh.Maybe  I have visual on contact directly ahead!Toni breathed, his heart skipping a beat.Three hundred meters beyond his position, near the maximum probable range of a grenade throw, stood the enemy Suit, proud and tall and drenched in blood.Hanging from its gorget like an oversized neck tie, was a bloodied and mangled corpse clad in ROWACs pixilated cammo fatigues.The corpse swayed ever so slightly in the strong wind and Toni watched, horrified, and tried to understand the mind of the pilot who had hung it there.The attempt failed.Kaiser he could understand, but not this.This is something else, someone else entirely, he suddenly realized, and a cold fear gripped him as the monster silently surveyed the terrain before it.This isnt gonna work!His mind screamed as he began to careen towards panic.Once he arrived there, however, the dark stranger inside opened an eyelid and bid everything turn to ice.The storm in his mind suddenly abated, and he found himself gripping the double pack charge almost to the point of tearing its tough fabric.Relaxing his grip, he peered out towards his enemy and willed his fear to die away, until all that remained was the grim realization that he was laying his eyes on the bringer of his death.He decided to accept that truth, knowing that he wouldnt be able to move a muscle otherwise, remembering that he hated cowards more than he would hate to die.With a luminous flash, three sudden plumes of soil sprouted into the sky, uniting at the speed of sound into a wall of earth and blocking the enemy Suit entirely from his sight.The following moment the concussive shockwaves reached him and, despite his semi prone position behind the shelter, his Hammerhead was almost lifted into the air.The noise to his right made it plain that Parks unit, more exposed as it was to the elements, had impacted violently against the ground.He began to count the seconds through clenched teeth, each one an opportunity to attack not taken advantage of.When he reached five he snapped, pulled the pair of blue cords from the device in his hand, and lobbed it out towards the rising dust cloud.The throw was better than he had expected it to be, but no sooner had it reached the cloud than, still high above the ground and quickly descending, it detonated spectacularly.What?Toni had time to say, before an arriving Park explained his error for him.Three to four seconds, you fool!Thats the delay time of the hand grenades were using to initiate these charges.Just cause you can throw that far doesnt mean itll get there.His Suit was still covered in soil from his fall, but his voice remained calm nevertheless.But if our expected range is two hundred meters, then we were too far back to begin with  he began, but his conclusion was cut short by a streaking missile that punched through the dust cloud and roared over their heads.A moment later, a painfully intense flash of light filled his field of vision and the remainder of the minefield detonated simultaneously, lifting an entire wall of earth into the sky and then towards them.Toni barely had time to throw himself into the ground before the collection of shockwaves reached them with the power of a small nuclear weapon.His unit was launched backwards, uprooted trees crashing around his rolling frame as he lost notion of his horizon.He came to a sudden stop at the roots of a particularly sturdy pine tree, which nevertheless balanced back and forth like a metronome in slow motion.Then another shockwave, one with less weight behind it but far more snap, collided against his reclined form and the trees that surrounded him, and the majority of the old pines branches came crashing violently to the ground.All the forests leaves fell like confetti and Toni felt somehow he had had such a vision before, a lifetime ago when two thermonuclear weapons had changed his life.Youre dead, the stranger in his mind informed him gleefully, it doesnt matter if you die, cause youre already dead.He knew what the voice was implying; it was time to find the monster and kill it.And after that was over and done with he would go find Ian and kill him too.The thought brought a cruel smile to his lips, and he stood once more, noticing that his second blue cord charge was nowhere to be seen.Nor was Park, for that matter.Pulling a red cord double whammy from his webbing, he gripped it firmly and lowered his center of mass, and then he set off back to his initial position to reestablish visual with the bakemono.As he laid his eyes once more on the remains of the minefield, he found a wall of dust one kilometer across rising high into the sky, where the savage winds were proceeding to demolish it.Without a second thought he stepped into it, his visibility suddenly diminishing to no more than a few meters.Forwards he marched, heedless of the risk, eager to meet the alien who was tearing his world apart.Because whatever its form, he absolutely refused to consider it human.And that made it all so much easier, since once something was no longer human there was no need to speak of honor or fair treatment.He understood what Ray had done for the first time, and knew also what logic had made his friend kill the dark man in the first place.If only he had done the same to Kaiser, his mate might still be alive for two Earthlings dead.There was a lesson hidden in there somewhere; no good deed goes unpunished, no need to be the good guy, not authorized to be a hero, no   Snapping and ripping sounds suddenly made themselves heard, and he bounded blindly towards its source, managing only to plunge into the massive hole left by a landmines detonation.Collapsing onto his kneepads, he twisted into a roll and smacked his backplate against the sodden ground at its center.The force of the impact caused him to pendulate in his HINT for the briefest of moments, making it clear that he had probably not been too far from double slamming against the cavitys rear wall.More snaps and suddenly Toni was roaring as he rolled onto his four appendages, and he coursed his way out of the fosse in bounding strides, leaving a twisted and torn double whammy behind to soak in the muddy water.Pulling another charge from its webbing, he bounded over the terrain, falling twice as his body slowly became accustomed to maneuvering and compromising with the new HINT.A louder snap, followed by a crimson fireball that illuminated the haze directly ahead, made it clear to him what was happening.Passing the double whammy from left hand to right, he accelerated to maximum velocity until a silhouette became plain before his eyes.It was too large to be a Hammerhead.It turned suddenly towards him but it was too late; Toni had already pulled the red armbands out of his charge the moment after the switch from one hand to the other, and he slammed the device high upon the upper thorax of his enemy as frame collided against frame.The detonation was catastrophic, and Digger Threes right appendage blew apart as the force of the explosion separated both Suits as quickly as they had united.Toni screamed in pain, the HINTs violent flurry as it emulated its synchronized appendages final moment causing old wounds to tear.He double slammed against the cavitys interior and then the Suit collided against the ground, the interface cranes pendulation wreaking havoc in his inner ears as he tried to stop his roll and recover.Finally sliding to a stop, he peered at his right appendage, finding only a stump at his elbowpad, loose PAMs diverging from his spaulder like fat bananas and loosely surrounding their endoskeletal gas conveyors.It looked like Mr.Fandangos Class of Fucking Robot Anatomy.STERBEN!he suddenly heard screamed from a very loud loudspeaker, and he rolled instinctively as brilliant lines of white light flashed all around him.Finding his feet, he fixed his eyes on the source of the light show and pulled another double whammy from his webbing.He attempted to pull the red band, discovering that he had no hand to pull it with.His next instinct, pulling the band with his teeth, failed due to the Hammerhead not possessing such an innovation.All that remained as the laser pulses closed in on him was to place the band between his kneepads and give the packs a stiff pull.He then lobbed the grenade towards his adversary and threw himself into the dirt.The detonation caused Tonis Suit to slide, and he dug his stump into the ground to anchor him firmly there.Wobbling slightly, Toni stood again and rushed forwards in desperate search of his adversary, finding the Unmil on its knees attempting to re shoulder its rifle.Forgetting the grenades, he rushed his adversary and launched a vicious kick towards its helm, only to discover that it somehow no longer had one.It was with his trailing appendage that he finally struck the Suit, causing him to lose balance and plow into the ground on the other side and onto his right spaulder.Abandoning long range combat, he wrapped his remaining appendages around his adversarys lower body and tried to kick the rifle from its gripping gauntlets.Several failed attempts later, Toni realized that its musculature and structure were way beyond those of any Hammerhead, and it inexorably turned to face him as if wrestling with a child.The monster finally released its weapon and grabbed a firm hold of him by his webbing, and Toni began to feel himself being lifted off the ground.Oh well, its sayonara time, isnt it, Chum?the stranger quipped delightedly, and Toni was forced to agree with him.Thinking fleetingly of his family, he pulled both red and blue bands from his remaining charges with his remaining gauntlet, and then pushed his webbing as far away from his body as possible and towards his killers arms.The detonation knocked him out cold.TWENTY ONE      Above Base Fido, Natures Day, 21st of June, 2771      Toni returned to consciousness inside the personnel cabin of an air force copter.It was probably noisy out there, since all those without earmuffs were presently pressing their hands against their ears.One of the earmuffed soldiers noticed that he was conscious and said something to the high ranking officer beside him.The old officer, whose appearance suggested that he had just survived hell, leaned over him and spoke a few words.Toni wasnt too good at reading lips, but the man seemed to be trying to console him.Toni asked whether the Unmil was dead, and was surprised to discover that he couldnt hear his own voice.The sad expression on the officer alarmed him.Was he sad because it was not?Or was it because he hadnt understood the question?He tried to move but found that he couldnt, and he began to panic, wondering whether he was strapped down or whether he no longer had use of his body.He closed his eyes, preferring the darkness, and felt hot tears roll down his face.He returned to the warm void where his savage self roamed, and remained there for a while.When he awoke again, Toni lay in a cot in a medical bay quite different from the one he had known at Base Fido.That single compartment possessed a surface area larger than Fidos medical bay, and hospital cots like his lined both sides of its considerable length.To his right was a wide entrance, its double doors kept open as nurses and orderlies passed busily through to attend to the injured.The patients numbered at least thirty.He suddenly realized that he was able to hear again, and he lay there for a while, weeping quietly and thanking the gods for their mercy.
