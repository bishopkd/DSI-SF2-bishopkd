He then closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of his surroundings.His ears felt like they had been stuffed with cotton, but still he could hear nearby patients in conversation, the howling wind outside and even the occasional groan of pain.Discovering also that he had the use of his left arm, he touched his hand to an ear and felt through its folds, finding nothing jammed in there.His ears were back, but they werent in good shape and possibly never would be.His sadness was greatly lessened when he found he could also move his legs.Slowly he flexed them, and felt more than heard his knees snap painfully.It was an acceptable pain, one that told him he might one day run again.Something struck Tonis head and he opened his eyes, peering about.Finding a crinkled piece of paper on his bandaged chest, he searched for its thrower, and found a patient of his age smiling in the cot beside him.Got your ears pretty hammered, huh?the boy asked cheerily.Toni had no difficulty in understanding the question, and indeed the other patients had winced at the loudness with which the boy had spoken.The soldier turned out to be an aircraft maintenance assistant by the name of Harry Osaka.Four days previously, as they had been prepping a drone with missiles for an attack sortie, someone had made the mistake of maneuvering the forklift a little too aggressively and had collided against the craft, rupturing its fuel tank.The end result had been an escalating chain of fires, deflagrations and detonations that had left two base personnel dead and more than twenty injured, Harry among them.When asked if he knew anything about what had happened at Base Fido, Harry appeared puzzled, and the base rat was forced to grapevine with the remaining patients before presenting Toni with the sole tidbit of information regarding ROWACs and EWACs delaying activities; ROWACs commander was dead and a score more injured, both unit commands having been effectively put out of action by a single nuke.The information was known only due to the fact that the injured had been evacced to Lograin, all other details being classified.Swallowing his sadness for the old natural, Toni thanked the runway jockey for the intel.They chatted for a while longer, Toni having to strain his ears and Harry his voice until an irritated nurse finally approached, putting an end to the loud conversation.They were duly informed that night had begun, and the curtains were closed and day lights extinguished as if to underline the point.Toni was relieved.The effort of keeping his head turned to his left side had left him with a crick that took a while to subside, and his brow had beaded with sweat with the effort it had required to listen to the chatty mechanics assistant.He closed his eyes again and found blissful darkness to match the silence.A nurse arrived shortly afterwards with a syringe and then it was his pain that was numbed, and he drifted off to sleep with titans colliding in his groggy mind.An eternity later morning came, and he smeared the sleep off his face with his only working hand.A nurse arrived shortly afterwards to raise his cot and place a tray of breakfast on his lap.Thankfully finding Harry still deep in blissful sleep, he ate his eggs and toast peacefully, caring not in the least for the lack of salt or butter.Someone had finally deigned to update the wall clock, and he found that it was a quarter past eight in the morning.Shortly after nine oclock a senior nurse arrived, gave him a nervous smile and began to search through a transparent plastic bag beside his bed that contained a tattered and bloody uniform.Finding a nametag there, she carefully cleaned and read it before apologizing to him and exiting the room in a hurry.Something struck the back of his head and a crumpled piece of paper ricocheted towards an intermediate nurses station, earning them a rebuking glare from the squat nurse who was nesting there.Toni turned to find a very alert Harry leaning towards him.Suppressing his despair at the prospect of another neck ache, he smiled and leaned towards his neighbor, only to have the boy slip him a folded piece of paper.Toni read the message there and felt his heart begin to gather speed.THAT IS THE SECOND TIME THEYVE GONE THROUGH YOUR STUFF!THEY KEEP CHECKING OUT YOUR NAMETAG, AND THEYVE BEEN WHISPERING LIKE THERES TROUBLE.WHATS GOING ON?Not trusting himself to whisper low enough, he requested his mates marker and scribbled a quick answer.PROBABLY IN TROUBLE!GOT A LITTLE POISON PILL IN MY UNIT WHO WANTS TO DO ME IN.CAN YOU WALK?Harry nodded and, following Tonis gestures, he limped towards the foot of the cadets bed and discreetly removed the chart that had been hung there.As he handed it towards him, Toni mouthed a very genuine word of thanks and then carefully inspected the untidily scrawled document.An EWAC soldier by the name of Frederic Granger was apparently into his fourth day of internment after having suffered traumatic injuries during combat.The soldiers right arm had suffered significant tissue damage, and had already been subjected to corrective surgery.Aside from that, the patient had suffered penetrating wounds from more than two hundred incandescent spalls into his upper and lower body (presumably originating from the interior surface of a Suits armor), which had had to be removed before stem cell netting could be applied over his burned skin.The patient had suffered a multitude of hematomas due to his Suits straps, a severe concussion that by itself would require at least three weeks of convalescence, and damage of unknown seriousness to his hearing.The patient also happened to possess a deep incisive wound to the right side of his face, although it appeared to have healed well enough to not require further treatment.The injuries were very familiar, as was their origin, but the name was not.And then Toni remembered what he had done before going into combat against the Bakemono; he had garbed the previous occupants uniform over his own to protect his body from the interfaces punishing straps.Carefully he sat up and removed the plastic bag with his belongings from beneath the nightstand.Searching its interior, he found a torn and blood spattered dolmen and inspected its nametag.It read Frederic Granger A+.Toni thanked the gods that the soldiers blood type was the same as his.Searching beneath its tortured fabric, he found his own dolmen and removed the Velcro nametag with his true identity as discreetly as possible.The gesture did not pass unnoticed by Harry.He hurriedly scribbled message onto another piece of paper.IS YOUR NAME TONI MIURA?Tonis world began to tilt to the side.He had been too cautious about it for Harry to be able to read his nametag, which was now carefully hidden away in his hospital supplied underclothes.He took the paper from the soldier and wrote a quick answer.YES.HOW DID YOU KNOW?MP SHOWED UP HERE WHILE YOU WERE KO, LOOKING FOR A TONI MIURA.MP?MILITARY POLICE.THEY WERE LOOKING FOR YOU!And that was that for him.There was only one thing left to do, and that was to find Ian and kill him before he lost his chance for good.His mind began to work frantically through all the options at his disposal.A nurses arrival interrupted his thoughts.Corporal, could I have a quick word?Y yes, nurse, he replied.Were having problems registering your name into our database, apparently theres another Frederic Granger in our patient list, he had a work related stroke a few days ago.Could you please confirm your name?she kindly asked him.Thinking hard, Toni threw himself at the only door he could find.My name is Raymond Rosa, Im a Sergeant cadet from LOGIS, MEWAC.I was using Grangers uniform for lack of my own, Im sorry ...he lied.She brightened up immediately and thanked him for his cooperation before taking her leave.Belatedly he turned towards Harry to find him shaking his head disapprovingly.The boy took up the piece of paper again and scribbled furiously.HOW MANY NAMES DO YOU HAVE, ANYWAY??BUT THAT PROBABLY WONT WORK.THEIR DATABASE IS ON THE GMN.IF THE GUY WHOS NAME YOU GAVE IS SOMEWHERE ELSE OR MISSING, THEYLL KNOW!Missing!Ray was dead, but he was probably listed as missing.He had just bought himself minutes, not days!Hurriedly he thanked a bewildered Harry and carefully stood on his feet, finding that even his soles hurt.Grimacing with the pain, he checked to make sure that no one was looking, and then set off like any other patient with a need to pee would; with great care and greater urgency.Exiting the compartment, he found himself in a wide corridor.He turned towards what appeared to be the buildings exit, a well illuminated atrium with a reception to one side and four men on the other, MP written into their armbands in capital letters.Toni about faced and followed the corridor in the opposite direction, coming across a lavatory populated with a pair of peeing patients.He occupied a stall as they did their business, thinking hard.His mind remained sluggish, however, and he realized that he didnt even know whether he had the strength for what needed to be done.The pair finally left the room and he exited the stall nervously.Acting on a whim, he quickly locked the lavatory from the inside and proceeded to open the window.After several failed attempts it finally opened with a clang, and the compartments interior was suddenly invaded by a whirlwind.Only a fool would venture outside with the wind so strong and a body so frail, but a fool was he, and he sat his rump on the sill and pivoted his legs over with great effort.His hospital skirt suddenly blew into his face, his hidden nametag magically slipping out of his breeches and over his head to strike against the lavatory door.Moving feet were clearly visible beneath it.Cursing loudly, barely managing to hear the words due to the wind, Toni jumped out and fell the half meter that separated him from the medical bays grassy grounds.Unable to keep his footing, he purposely fell on his left shoulder to lessen the damage.The pain, however, was terribly severe, and he knew that somewhere he was bleeding again.Cant you do anything without bleeding?He remembered Hannah and wondered if she had survived the engagement, the real possibility that she might be dead agonizing him more than the pain.Suppressing the thought, he carefully stood and stepped into the buffeting wind, peering at his surroundings and trying to situate himself from what he remembered when he had last been there.LOGIS had spent most of its time in the perimeter of Lograins airfield, and so he searched for that first.To his left were a few buildings, some of them derelict, and then a fence and the shifting forest beyond.He turned to his right and shuffled towards a group of taller buildings blocking his view of whatever lay beyond.Lowering his center of mass as if he were driving an armored Suit, he leaned into the wind and moved towards the buildings, desperately hoping that he wasnt being watched.Feeling the chilly wind suck all the heat from his body, Toni began to regret not having remained in the warmth of his hospital bed.He might even have gladly accepted being arrested just to stay warm and safe.Then he imagined the firing squad and the little smile on Ians face as he watched, and knew the cold was preferable to that.Not because of his execution, of course.It was the smile that bothered him, that cruel, un empathetic, superior smile of his that said everything about what really went on inside the traitors mind.He could not bear to see that smile again.Colonel Tora was dead and who in hell knew if the Bakemono was dead or not, but if he was going to face a firing squad, it would be while savoring the memory of sitting on the traitors chest, grinning like an idiot as he cut his seniors pale throat.The wind changed as he closed in on the nearest building, and instead of fighting against his advance, it began to push him towards the darkened edifice.There was no sign of activity inside, and as he stumbled towards an imposing pair of solid wooden doors, he chanced a quick look towards the medical bay.There was no sign of activity at its exterior.Momentarily encouraged, he twisted the doors knob only to find it solidly locked.Kicking it in was beyond serious consideration.Fighting the wind, Toni rounded the building and soon found himself on a wide abandoned avenue.Finding another locked door, he lost his patience, found a hefty rock and tossed it towards one of the ground floor windows.The projectile struck the glass and it fractured, retaining its integrity only due to the thick protective film that covered it.The abetting wind did the rest, and under the gales relentless force, the pane finally caved in and flew into the buildings interior.The sudden whoomp!it made as it disappeared would have attracted much attention on any other season of the month.Today the noise was almost entirely drowned out by the winds.Grunting with the effort, Toni pulled himself onto the window sill and forced his legs over it, the strong wind helping to forcefully vault him into what appeared to be an office compartment.He struck the ground hard and began to roll slowly across the cluttered floor, moaning in agony as the invading whirlwind sent papers flying into the air around him.Once the pain had subsided, Toni stood and tried the only door, finding it unlocked.Opening it carefully, he peered out through the crack to find only a central corridor bordered by windows to his left and closed office doors to his right.Closing the door behind him, Toni limped along the pristine corridor, its cleanliness an assault on his senses after weeks of blood and grime.Quietly he paced its length, still expecting some caretaker to appear as he passed a succession of sealed doors, until he came upon an elaborately decorated entrance hall, its double doors the same ones he had attempted to open minutes before.The hall was flanked by a wide staircase that allowed access to the floors above.Tiredly he gazed at those steps, wondering if he had the strength.Finally coming to a decision, he began to carefully climb the flights, calmly allowing the stranger to take the helm as he did so.Upon reaching a floor, he peered at his surroundings, sniffed the air, and then kept climbing.On the fifth and final floor, the stranger sniffed something that caught its attention.The floor was dirtier but well trodden, and most tracks led off to the corridor to his left.Following them, he eventually came upon several doors deep inside the building.The nearest was unlocked, and he opened the door and walked inside.He found himself inside a workshop clearly meant for building maintenance and repair, its interior clad with weapons of diverse size and weight.On another day it might have been a toolshed, but to the strangers eyes it was an armory.He searched the compartments walls for anything both compact and deadly, and slowly came to the realization that he would need a cutting instrument to fit the part.He ruffled through several desk drawers, coming upon his first box cutter.Before long he held four in his newly grimed hands.Two he discarded for being too fragile to hold up in a fight.A third, already well used, he reserved for an emergency.The fourth, a wickedly sharp blade about twelve centimeters long when fully extended, became his weapon of choice.He imagined it covered in blood, and willed it to become so.His sweet mother of Galician descent had once told him of an ancient god her far off ancestors had prayed to in times of war.Its name was Cosus, if he wasnt mistaken.Hoping he had remembered the name correctly, he held the weapon between his palms and prayed to the non existent god, pouring all his hate into the weapon in his hands.He had never done anything even remotely similar before, but it felt right, and it settled his mind and heart enough to accept what needed to be done, and what he would probably have to sacrifice in order to achieve it.He had already wasted all his life points against the Bakemono.He accepted that as he stood in the center of the workshop, and it brought him peace.His peace was rudely broken by a rifle butt to the head.The sudden impact drove him almost to the ground but, lowering his center of mass having become his first instinct when attacked, he buckled his knees, laying both hands on the floor before snapping his head over his shoulder to scrutinize his assailant.His adversaries were two well armed MPs, the looks their eyes making it clear they knew that they had found the missing cadet.The sergeant spoke, but Toni didnt hear the words.Instead he observed both soldiers as they covered his only exit.Their uniforms were characteristically black, their berets navy blue, their Lacraus strapped to a diagonal leather shoulder belt that clipped onto a waist belt, and upon which a sidearm rested in its holster.But Toni didnt care about that.They wore high leather gloves that covered the tendons at their wrists and much of their forearms, and the only adequate remaining target was their exposed throats.Toni cared about that.And there was a rifle between him and his nearest foes throat, its strap not long enough to turn against his second adversary without first having to waste a precious moment to cut the bond.Slowly he relaxed his body, realizing he must certainly be raising red flags in the MPs minds.He shook his head, trying to force himself into thinking.What do you mean, no?On the ground or Ill pop you.This is your last warning!the sergeant ordered.Turning his head slowly towards his superior, Toni smiled, finding it appropriate that hed already managed to put in a prayer.He hadnt managed to see or hear any more soldiers beyond the room, and he no longer had any expectation that there would be.He stared hard at the sergeant as the soldiers nose flared at his targets non compliance, and saw only swine there.The sergeants lacrau was a compact weapon with a bull pup design, meant for movement and combat in tight spaces, but that was going to work in Tonis favor.Springing into action, Toni grabbed the rifle in his right hand and launched himself towards the sergeant, managing to leap frog his hand forwards to grab his adversarys shoulder belt as his left slipped the box cutters blade out of its handle.Easy does it, now.He leaned hard into the sergeant and sent him thudding against his corporal, and his left hand snaked along his foes torso until the blade nestled against the straining muscles of his neck.The sergeant gave a squeal and fired off a burst, but then the corporal slammed against the corridor wall and all three came to a sudden halt.Toni began to push the blade in, the ease with which the steel suddenly entered the sergeants throat shocking him enough to make him pause momentarily, his adversary squealing and kicking as he pleaded for his life.Toni then began to cut more deliberately, putting more power behind the act, until the blade suddenly dug entirely in and laid bare the left and center of his foes throat.The sergeant fired off a long, impotent burst from his Lacrau and wood splinters flew, its barrel snugly secured beneath Tonis armpit as the sergeants horrendous wound gave up its treasure.Blood poured in hot jets against Tonis surprised face, flowing into his mouth as his jaw fell open at the affront, fat drops spraying heavily against the wall and the corporals struggling body with every generous spout.The sergeant released his weapon and clapped his hands against his throat, and the panicking corporal, pinned into a sitting position by his superiors weight, tried to throw the body over his knee and deploy his rifle.Toni laid his knee on the weapon and pushed it down, and then placed his blade against the soldiers throat and held it there with both hands, shock and horror briefly freezing his muscles in place.Im sorry!Im sorry!Im so sorry, man.Just let me go.I wont tell, OK?OK?!the corporal pleaded as his senior rolled over the tiled floor beside him.The soldier had a cleft chin, and it was clean shaven despite him having the look of someone whose beard grew thickly.His dark hair had recently seen a pair of scissors.His eyes were wide and leaking, and his eyebrows were crushed together and reaching for the sky, his eyes possessing the pitiful expression of one who had just learned how one died by the blade.The soldier was well into his twenties, but in that moment he sounded clearly like a child, and Toni pitied and hated him for that.Im sorry ...Toni answered sadly, and with a sudden snap of his body, he opened the mans throat.Blood sprayed everywhere, momentarily blinding him, and as his adversary clutched the gaping wound and began to roll beneath him, Toni felt a hand take hold of his shoulder.He stared at the large hand, painted red with its owners blood, and he had a flash of a bloody armored Suit with a corpse hanging from its gorget.Turning to face the sergeant, he found the man stooping over him, Lacrau hanging loosely from its strap as the soldier used his free hand to plug the wound.The hand appeared almost sunk into his throat, but the expression on his face was tragic, and it spoke words the man could no longer utter.He fell upon Tonis kneeling form and vomited a gush of blood upon him, and then he lay down where his dying subordinate thrashed and took him in his arms.A minute passed by as Toni, sitting numbly with his back against the corridors wall, watched them bleed to death.The two men held each other tightly until the sergeant ceased to move, and then the corporal released himself from his superiors limp grasp, huddled into a corner, and died alone.Before long there were no more sucking and choking sounds, and silence became bliss.It was a while before Toni finally realized he was crying, and he continued to do so for a time.A long while later, Tonis breathing became regular and he stopped spitting compulsively to rid himself of the taste of the fallen soldiers blood.He decided that he had learned something new about himself.He was most certainly not a born killer.What he had done horrified him, left him disgusted with himself.The emotion was so powerful that he found himself trying to smother it, before the horror could smother him.Obeying a sudden urge to not look upon the corpses, he abandoned the corridor and took refuge in the workshop.Standing before a mirror fixed into the wall over a tiny lavatory, he stared at his reflection, newly horrified by what he saw.There were places where blood hadnt smeared, but they were no wider than a coins breadth.His hair had become stuck to his skull, and he had what he could only call a blood beard, where the blood soaked up by his two week old fuzz had begun to clot.He looked into his own eyes, but quickly averted them as a potent wave of shame nearly overcame him.Slowly he began to wash his face, and then his hair and neck, until finally he began to carefully peel off his clothing and bandages, layer by layer.He finally stood naked and decidedly cleaner, and he inspected his injuries against a mirror that had become speckled with drops of diluted blood.He realized he was fortunate in that the MPs had not put up a more considerable resistance.His right arm was bleeding from the corner of a half healed surgical incision above his elbow, although it wasnt even a trickle compared to what he had witnessed some minutes before, and the medical weaving that covered much of his chest, abdomen, groin and thighs seemed to require the bandages he had just removed to prevent infection.Every injured surface that had suffered compression ached terribly, and he realized that he was possibly bleeding beneath the affected skin as well.That wouldnt make any difference, though.Covering up his crime was pointless, except in the interest of widening his window of opportunity to find and engage the special one.His injuries werent a problem either, since it would probably take days for any infection to do him in.Finding an oil stained overall inside a beaten locker, Toni put it on and pocketed his box cutters.There was also a dirty sweatshirt and he donned it as well, ignoring the fact that it was in direct contact with the stem cell matting that covered his injured flesh.Discovering a tough old pair of work shoes hidden deep in the locker, he put them on without socks and found that they fit snugly.Taking a moment to settle his emotions, he then walked out into the corridor and was struck by a powerful smell to accompany the vista.It was an odd smell, not foul but nauseating nevertheless, and he knew where it came from due to his stints at his fathers farm.Blood pooled around the deceased soldiers bodies, and had begun to clot.He approached them and the odor of clotting blood intensified, but eventually he realized he could deal with it.Toni searched through their pockets and shut down every electronic device he could find, including their watches.He unstrapped the less bloody of the two rifles and then stowed it along with two spare magazines into a rucksack he had found, before finally removing the pistol from the sergeants holster, taking note that his nametag read Luco Varano O  .The pistol, a semiautomatic Miroku in eight millimeter Short caliber, had a twenty four round magazine for a loaded weight of 480 grams, each round leaving the weapons barrel at a blistering Capicuan mach two; if he couldnt get the job done with that, then he deserved to fail.He checked the weapon and found the chamber clear and the magazine full.Feeling that the situation called for it, he racked the slide, chambering a round before placing the weapon on safety.The pistol found a noble place in the overalls front pocket.Before turning off their digital watches, Toni had noticed that it was only eleven.It shocked him.Less than two hours ago he had been lying on a hospital bed, sated and content.He wondered whether the two soldiers had informed their superiors which building they had entered.The reasons why they had entered in the first place seemed clear to him already; they had been searching for a missing patient and had found a broken window on the ground floor of the nearest building.That would have been enough for him to radio in, had he been in their shoes.That helped him to make up his mind.Leaving the building was vital, the chances of having a run in with another patrol being simply too high.He would find somewhere to hide and rest until nineteen hundred hours, since he could reasonably expect most base personnel at that hour to be at the canteen, along with a considerable percentage of those on duty.Donning a dirty air force cap and shouldering the rucksack, Toni exited the building gingerly from the vacant window.Holding onto his new head covering lest the powerful wind blow it away, he moved slowly among the buildings and away from the nearby medical bay, reminding himself repeatedly that he was now a base maintenance technician.His mind kept returning to the two dead bodies that lay behind him.He had taken the time to read the corporals nametag, finding to his dismay that the man had been named Toni Nievers.It was the first time he had ever killed a human being, and the stranger within was perhaps no longer as mysterious as it had once been, although it was certainly more silent for the moment.Perhaps it was just as shocked as Toni was.Either way, Toni was more committed than ever to his goal.He came upon an abandoned building that flanked a deactivated runway, its dilapidated structure three floors tall and its top flat and out of sight.That suited him just fine.Entering carefully through a vacant space that had once been furnished with doors, Toni climbed the closed staircase inside, ignoring the crepitating shudder every time a stronger gust shook the building, until he came upon a rusting metal door.Pushing it open to a loud creaking sound, he stepped back into the wind and then closed the door securely, jamming several pieces of broken concrete beneath it to ensure no one would be able to open it from the inside.He walked onto a roof that allowed him a fair view of the central part of Lograin air base.Barely registering that view, the powerful wind forcing him to shield his eyes, he plodded instead towards what appeared to be an empty shed at the roofs nearest corner.It consisted of two by two meters of dirt covered floor, but Toni didnt care; it was all a murderer needed for sleep, any convict in Leibens Central Presidiary Facility could vouch for that.TWENTY TWO      Lograin Air Base, Natures Day, 26th of June, 2771      It was the roar that woke him, not the howling wind.The howl was something one got used to after a lifetime in a bipolar world, but the roar was something else entirely.Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Toni wondered at what time it was, a sudden growling in his belly making it clear to him that he had missed a meal.He wondered whether the bases dinner horn had sounded yet.Then he realized that there was no way he could hope to hear the horn above the gale, finally understanding that he must have overslept.Hurriedly he exited the shed, only to be forced to take sudden hold of the doorway to keep from being swept off his feet.Finding his windlegs, he peered at his surrounding and gaped in wonder at what he saw.A Quasar heavy carrier presided over what Toni had believed to be a deactivated runway, its reactors nearing full throttle barely a hundred meters from where the building stood.It had only just begun to move, but already its vulture wings shuddered from the gale force winds, gigantic tires rolling over asphalt that appeared to have been sprouting weeds for years.It didnt make any sense; any fool could see that those were no conditions for an aircraft to takeoff.Unless an even greater threat is on its way here, the stranger opined, apparently rested enough to have reacquired an opinion.Toni reckoned he had more than one clock ticking against him.It was not just a matter of when the MPs would catch up to him, or whether Ian had already evacuated Lograin or not.If Lograin was evacuating all its personnel and he failed to find his way onto a transport, he would soon be braving the Bakemono and the Great Rains with nothing more substantial than a light infantry rifle.The wind had gained a characteristic iciness to it and the sky had become overcast, and both reminded him that the rains were less than a day away.Dark rainclouds raced over his head, making him wonder whether it was already too late.As the giant aircrafts reactors peaked and it began to pick up speed, he cupped his hands protectively around his ears and peered at his surroundings.What he saw confirmed his suspicions.The base was crawling with activity, and already he could see five more Quasars on their runways or taxiing towards their positions.He also spied what he had been hoping to find.Near the deactivated runways end and where it intersected one of the bases two main runways, was the colossal building that had been built to house MEWACs armored Suits.By the time the enormous transport was rumbling its way into the gloomy sky, Toni had gathered his rucksack and abandoned the decrepit building.He set off at a brisk pace towards the structure, dismally aware that the wind was against him and the ground terribly uneven.To walk on the runways level asphalt would be foolish, he decided, since it would probably earn him far more attention than he was willing to accept at the moment.The runways flank, however, was overgrown enough to provide cover and also act as a natural windbreak, and so he picked his way among the bushes and trees, estimating that the journey would take at least an hour to accomplish.The estimate proved to be optimistic.The detail he hadnt considered was the weight of his rucksack, and it was his mounting exhaustion that finally forced him to question the need to carry the cumbersome weapon.It would hardly be discreet or easy to deploy, and if he kept porting it with him, by the time he finally reached the stalls hed be too exhausted to fight.Finally deciding he would have to make do with the pistol, he abandoned the rucksack in a flooded ditch and continued to cross the uneven ground, his mind persistently returning to the men he had killed.He wondered why Ray hadnt made any noise as he died, and had a newfound respect for Kaiser, for having been able to pull off the kill without waking his victims comrades.It had been more than cold.It had been professional.And he was dead certain that he wasnt nearly as professional as Kaiser was.The runways outskirts were riddled with potholes and half buried rocks, testament to the shoddy method of construction that had birthed the base, their existence made more menacing by the overgrown vegetation that hid them from his eyes.Twice he almost twisted an ankle, the first time as he hurried to hide from another Quasar as it taxied along the runway to its starting point, the second as it came thundering along in the opposite direction.Although he couldnt be entirely certain, more than two hours had elapsed before he began to approach the better maintained outskirts of Lograins MEWAC accommodations.Lograins on base facilities usually followed one of two architectural philosophies; while most opted for a very solid construction, others favored a cheaper aerodynamic approach to deal with the winds.MEWACs accommodations, however, possessed both characteristics.Shaped like a particularly squat dumpling, it was nevertheless a very solid construction, favoring a reinforced concrete inner shell covered by a spaced steel outer casing.No attempt had been made at camouflage, and its gigantic grey form dominated its immediate surroundings, making even the Quasars look like over grown toys as they taxied nearby.Besides the grand entrance, where the Suits gained entry to the main hangers interior, the installations could be accessed through the three personnel entrances at its remaining three sides.The north east entrance awaited Tonis arrival, its gate entirely devoid of security.Curious but cautious, Toni peered at his surroundings, his paranoia heckling him despite the stables abandoned look.His hearings sorry state, the winds and the roaring Quasars all conspired to make him effectively deaf to his immediate surroundings, and that fuelled his mistrust more than anything else.Approaching a small prefabricated cement cube that functioned as a heavy machinegun bunker, he poked his head in and found no one.The primary weapon and its tripod were absent, and there wasnt an ammunition box within sight.The fact that the armored door had been left open, exposing its interior to the brutal elements, underlined the obvious; its complement had left in a hurry and without any prospect of return.Making a decision, he began to approach the main installations entrance.Its doors were ajar and he entered cautiously, taking care to check his corners before stepping through.He found the administrative section beyond devoid of light or people, and with its office doors locked.One could apparently rely on bureaucrats to lock their offices even when evacuating.He wandered through the dark maze of corridors, remembering nothing from the last time hed been there; all he had seen five weeks before had been the hanger area, where the stalls and servicing equipment could be found.Finally he came upon a shadowy tunnel that he felt pointed in the right direction, and decided to follow it.Before long he bumped against an unlocked door.He opened it to find that his sense of direction was not entirely absent.The hanger looked like an oversized cave, the overcast sky and complete absence of overhead lighting lending the place a forlorn look.The wind made music off the entrance, and Tonis ears were filled with howling and roaring.Realizing that he was wasting precious time there, Toni began to hurry towards the grand entrance when a shout caught his attention.Standing beside a heavy duty forklift stood a tall, slim man.Despite the darkness, what little light there was still shone off the stars on his shoulders.Approaching carefully, Toni called out.Something wrong, sir?The officer walked towards him and cracked a wide grin.Its been barely two weeks and youve already forgotten the sound of your owners voice, havent you?Tonis eyes widened as he looked the officer up and down, and realized he was staring at Lieutenant Templeton.The lieutenants grin widened even more, relieved at having finally located his subordinate.Sir!My apologies, sir, he finally answered, saluting him before he could stop himself.The lieutenant could have said something about Toni saluting him in civilian clothing, but instead he approached and warmly shook his hand.You were my only missing chick, you know it?Everyone else is either dead or accounted for.Are you alright?I was told you saw action after the mines.I am fine, sir, though Im still recovering.You said everyones accounted for.Are Ian and Hannah too?The lieutenants face turned ugly for a moment, and then he sighed.Both are accounted for, and in good health.Sir, I   Theres no need to say anything.Hannah said it all when she returned, and Ians been remanded into the custody of the Military Police.He will face court martial and so will you, probably.And youll both almost certainly get slaps on your wrists because youre both cadets, and were committed to combat before youd taken the oath.But I dont care about that.What I care about is that weve been ordered to evacuate, and there are people missing all over the place.First you, then a medical patient and now a couple of MPs.Toni felt a chill travel up his spine; he knew full well that none of them were missing.Feeling terrible, he tried to speak.Sir   Weve been ordered to evacuate.Our Quasar was already supposed to have lifted off, but Ive been pulling in some favors to get them to wait.Our platoon and the squad of MPs guarding Ian in there are going hungry, all because you were still unaccounted for.Now theres no longer any reason to wait.Within the hour we need to be on it, cause were expecting the base to get hit after that.Is it the Bakemono, sir?The ...what?The enemy Suit we fought at Base Fido, sir.No, no, some puke from EWAC took care of that one.Damaged it badly enough so that it pulled out of combat, to MEWACs everlasting shame.But Hannah at least managed to find two of its extremities and its helm, and weve got those in the Quasar for future research.Sir   Less talkie, more walkie, cadet.I   A radio squawked and the lieutenant snatched it irritably from his belt, and Tonis trigger finger slipped inside the trigger guard of the pistol in his pocket, almost causing the weapon to fire.He scolded himself silently as the lieutenant communicated with a very angry tower man, realizing that the last thing he wanted was the Ell tees blood on his hands.Hannah was alive, Ian was in custody and the Bakemono had been defeated.The fact that the soldier credited with the accomplishment happened to have been in an induced coma at the time was of little interest.He wondered about the dead MPs and tried once more to smother his shame.Whats wrong?Are you alright?the lieutenant asked with a look of alarm.Im fine, sir, he answered as a cold sweat began to bead his forehead, though Im just not feeling too good.Can you walk?Yes, sir.Good, because thats what youre going to do.Our Quasar has the number Thirty Seven on its tail.Youre going to find it and present yourself to its boarding sergeant.I have another matter to deal with.Can I help, sir?Can you?I think not.Well just be looking for some stragglers, and I dont intend to lose you again.Youll go straight to your transport, and thats an order.Clear?Toni nodded and apologized, and went on his way.Ill tell you where you can find those stragglers, if youd like, the stranger sniggered, and Toni began to weep.Realizing that the pistol in his pocket was the last obvious evidence of his crime, he ditched the weapon in a deep crevice beside the runway and approached the three aircraft awaiting permission for departure.He remembered Gordie and was suddenly anxious to see him again, and he prayed that his friend had managed to survive that day at the mines.He also remembered Hannah and reminded himself to thank her for all she had done.He tried not to think about Sueli.The birds were parked side by side along the apron that flanked a taxiway, and were indistinguishable except for the silver double digit numbers painted on their vertical stabilizers.Soldiers braved the winds and loitered near their tails, talking into each others ears as they peered nervously at the thunderous sky.Quasar Thirty Sevens rear cargo hatch was lowered and an ancient sergeant waited on it, howling inaudible curses at the wind, and at the wrench jockey who was approaching him.What?What?he ordered, the words curses unto themselves.Sergeant cadet Toni Miura reporting for evacuation, sir, Toni answered at attention.The sergeant looked him up and down, and then barked the inevitable question.Wheres your fucking uniform?My uniforms ruined and there was no one at deposit to hand me another, sir, he lied.Hah.Would have preferred to show up naked than like that, but to each his fucking own, right?he answered with a smirk.The sergeant took out a piece of paper to consult, but the wind suddenly snatched the document and sent it flying over the taxiway.Keeping a stiff upper lip, the sergeant irritably waved him into the aircraft.Passing the thick rubber curtain that shielded those inside from the foul weather, Toni came upon an interior altogether different from the one that had ferried LOGIS to Lograin.It was different enough, in fact, to make him wonder whether it was the same aircraft at all.Uncomfortable looking seats flanked both sides of the aircrafts aft interior, the central corridor having been left bare to allow myriad equipment and supplies to be strapped down.More rubber curtains hid the aircrafts central cabin from view.On their journey to Lograin there had been no seats or divided cabins, only a very sturdy floor over which the Suits could safely pad before shutting down to be secured to the structure.Then he remembered that most of the Mocas hadnt survived the plantation engagement, the crews probably having been forced to modify the aircraft to better suit the task of evacuation.Finding no one he knew among those seated, and feeling a little uneasy with such a large number of them being MPs, he passed through the second curtain and into the compartment beyond.Tonis puzzlement began to give way to alarm.He found not a single tied down armored Suit, but instead a continuation of the carefully secured and spaced payload along with many more seats, their occupants mainly base personnel and another handful of MPs.Wondering whether they could smell their comrades blood on his hands, Toni froze where he was, and as the group turned their gaze towards him his heart skipped a beat.They soon returned to their heated conversation, however, and he pushed the thought out of his mind.Feeling the aircraft begin to move, he took a seat beside a window as far as possible from the evacuees, trying not to look at the blue berets as they talked excitedly amongst themselves.Having apparently discovered that there was far more room in the center cabin than in the rear, a group of runway jockeys passed through the dividing curtain and began to choose their seats.One of them, apparently thinking that Toni was also base personnel, raised a hand in cheers and took a seat two places beside his.Toni knew what came next, and a few moments later the young soldier spoke to him.Excuse me?I said, looks like we got the final call, the young soldier repeated.Why do you say that?All the Quasars.Theyre taxiing all at once.Toni peered outside the window and confirmed that they were, and he wondered whether Lieutenant Templeton had managed to make it aboard.Standing again, he exited the central compartment and approached the boarding sergeant as he hollered at the soldiery to take their seats.Sir, has Lieutenant Templeton arrived yet?The sergeant gave him a murderous look.And now the fucking cadet!I just confirmed to the Lieutenant on comms that youre aboard, Im not about ask him where the fuck he is!And rest assured that Lograin Tower would rather abandon an entire company to die here than sacrifice a single Templeton!Does that mean the other Temple  Fuckoff!Back!To!Your!Fucking!Seat!FUCK!he howled, and the base personnel laughed and hooted as the old sergeant bulldozed Toni back to his seat.The sergeant then returned to his own seat beside the cargo door, hollering curses at all present as he passed them by, and even the MPs had the good grace to lower their heads at his irate passage, some going so far as to applaud his labors.So Toni was on the right carrier, on the principle that the lieutenant hadnt sounded blindly to all aircraft to confirm whether he was on board.But if so, then where was his platoon?Where was Ian, along with the compliment of MPs guarding him?And where were the Suit parts that Hannah had managed to apprehend?Ignoring the base pukes newest attempt to strike up a conversation, Toni stood again and, ignoring the reproving glare of the nearby MPs, began to make his way to the forward cabin.Passing through the heavy curtain, he found the compartment full of low density, high volume loads secured with netting.It included mostly an abundant stock of fuel and paper documents, and he realized that if they were to crash the fireball would be spectacular.As he returned to his seat in deep thought, he barely noticed how the personnel had congregated around the circular windows, the soldiers practically silent except for some quiet observation from one or another.There was no more care for remaining seated, the sergeants absence from that cabin effectively leaving them to do as they pleased....and weve got those in the Quasar for future research.Toni was almost certain that was what the lieutenant had said.But which Quasar?Toni had presumed that he had been referring to their Quasar, but it could just as easily have been another.And where was the remainder of his platoon?As he took his seat, he began to wonder whether the lieutenant had deceived him, but quickly he banished the thought from his mind.The lieutenant had never shown any fondness for his nephew, the relationship between them appearing much closer to indifference than love.And there was the matter of the very genuine warmth and relief he had displayed only minutes ago.Banishing the thought to the back of his mind, Toni tapped the chatty base puke on the shoulder and asked what all the fuss was about.Really?!Fourteen Quasars are about to try and takeoff at the same time from three different runways!Thats more than eight thousand tons on the move at the same time without anyone in the tower to coordinate, since theyve boarded a carrier themselves.The chances of there being a mid air collision are beyond bad, theyre terrifying.How can you be so calm?Just ignorant, I guess ...Toni replied.The soldier looked at him for a moment and then turned towards the window again, shaking his head and muttering.Toni wondered whether he and the soldier belonged to the same species.There was a sudden blinding flash of light, quickly followed by two more, and all personnel who had been looking out the window suddenly yelled in pain, clapping hands to their faces as if they had just been burned there.Those are nukes detonating, guys, Toni heard himself saying.Get away from the windows and dont look out again.Strap yourselves in cause the shockwaves are on their way.Knocking into each other in their haste and blindness, the center cabin passengers began to sit into the seats nearest to them and fasten their seatbelts.Every second that passed by made Toni more certain that the detonations had taken place a fair distance away, since the six roaring engines had only choked for a brief moment following the flashes.Then the shockwaves arrived, and they struck the aircrafts fuselage hard enough to momentarily rock it on its landing gear.There were a few screams and squeals, and Toni was once again reminded of the two men he had murdered.As the Quasar began to turn in to its starting point on Lograins runway number one, Toni found the window beside him facing roughly south east, where he observed five mushroom clouds ascending the skies perhaps ten kilometers off.That surprised him, since he didnt know of any permanent construction to be found there.Reminding himself to follow his own rules, he turned away from the window and found himself looking at the young soldier.Am I gonna go blind, man?he asked as he blinked his eyes furiously.Have no idea, mate.If you can see anything at all then its probably not that bad, I think.Dont worry about it, weve got bigger   There were several more flashes of light, and the engines choked again before resuming their approach to their full power.Toni counted the seconds away and, once he reached fifteen, the thunderclaps finally reached them, making the fuselage creak and groan and shudder in a way that did not sound healthy at all.Turning to his side, Toni observed six more mushroom clouds rising in the foreground to their predecessors, about six kilometers off.Our base defenses arent even firing, man.Theyve abandoned their posts, the fucking cowards!the soldier cried, only to be stiffly corrected by another.Thats bullshit!The systems automated, the GMNs taking care of the defense.Theyre leapfrogging ...Toni muttered.What?!I said that theyre leapfrogging, Toni said more loudly.Theyre firing those nukes outside the bases area of intervention.When the mushroom clouds rise high enough to block all radar and infrared, they fire a second volley through them and detonate those nukes closer to the base than they could otherwise have gone.If they keep doing that   Game over ...the first soldier breathed.Right.Lets just hope were out of here by then, Toni finished as he watched the clouds rise, almost hypnotized by their beauty.He hurriedly diverted his eyes once more, focusing instead on trying to calculate how long it would take for the nukes to strike the base proper.He got as far as figuring out that, as the base anti missile systems delay in detection and response decreased the nearer the enemy missiles came, the leapfrogs would need to be shorter to prevent interception.The exercise left him clueless as to how long they had before the missiles came within killing range.Not again ...another soldier moaned as several more blinding flashes strobed Tonis field of vision.He felt the heat on his face and turned to see seven luminous golden spheres ascend the skies, their distance perhaps four kilometers away.The Quasar was already accelerating along the runway, gaining the much needed speed for safe takeoff, and Tonis stomach lurched as the reactors began to struggle unexpectedly.They were supposed to be EMP resistant, but it was quickly becoming clear that they were not immune.There were cries of panic as the engines continued to hesitate, but then they resurged and all backs were suddenly pressed against their seats.The shockwaves struck the aircrafts fuselage in a flurry, and the left wing began to tip up alarmingly.A loud grinding noise became clearly audible to all, although it ceased abruptly as the carrier righted itself.Wing just scraped against the tarmac, guys.God!a civvie seated near a window on the right side informed them, and Toni began to wonder whether he should perhaps be a little more concerned.Then an unexpected shockwave struck them, weaker in intensity but with much more push.As the aircrafts fuselage began to tip upwards and the tires separated from the ground, the windows from both sides abruptly darkened as the screaming reactors changed their tune.Barely a second passed and then the aircraft was out of the smoke cloud and airborne, leaving everyone in the cabin acutely aware of the fact that the preceding aircraft had crashed.The runway jockeys wept as several more intense flashes blinded the passengers.Gods, Toni muttered in irritation as the reactors began to lose power, feeling his innards rise as the aircrafts ascent faltered.But they resurged once again and the Quasar began to put distance between itself and the air base.Banking sharply as it ascended, the pilots pointed the aircrafts tail towards the imminent shockwaves.When they arrived, the impacts were weaker than those preceding them, letting the passengers in on the fact that they had seen the worst of it.Toni closed his eyes, wondering whether he deserved the reprieve.Finding no ready answer, he remained seated, quietly observing the surrounding soldiers.Some behaved like frightened animals, twisting around skittishly in their seats like cats in a shaken travel cage.Others, particularly the older personnel, he envied for their calm.The most senior of the MPs, an old lieutenant who had probably begun his career from base rank, appeared unfazed by the events, and he eyed Toni coldly as if he suspected something.Toni couldnt blame him.He closed his eyes again.The aircraft continued its unsteady ascent, the strong winds buffeting its fuselage as it passed through turbulent airstreams.Every once in a while, several flashes illuminated the cabins interior and Tonis darkened world would momentarily strobe black and red.The shockwaves gradually lost their snap and the carrier began to turn again, and he opened his eyes to peer out his window.He found a slowly turning world beyond, low and remote and wild.More than a minute passed by until he was awarded with a sight of what had once been Lograin air base.It had become a mushroom farm, and indeed as he watched he could see them rising, ebony pillars with a marked inclination towards the north east, the once spherical clouds atop them no longer fully able to withstand the furious winds.Several more bright flashes momentarily blinded him and he was forced to turn away, the searing pain in his eyes greater than he would have expected.Closing them, he saw the ghosts of the detonations like static in his field of view.He counted them, realizing that four missiles had detonated before hed been able to turn away.He finally grasped the fact that his crime scene had been sanitized in a way he could never have accomplished by himself.The realization depressed him terribly.The truth would remain for him alone, making him feel like he had somehow claimed undue ownership over their souls.He remembered their names once more, and promised himself that he would find out whether they had children and, if so, whether they wanted for anything.He owed his victims that, at the very least.He opened his eyes to find the old MP lieutenant sitting quietly beside him.A feeling of unreality began to creep over him as the officer turned his eyes towards the recruit.Looks like theyve got us in a holding pattern, dont you think?he opined by way of conversation.Appears so, sir, Toni answered quietly.Theyve really hammered Lograin, havent they?It breaks my heart, seeing the world coming to an end like this.Its in times like these that we must be particularly vigilant.And self disciplined.Isnt that so, Sergeant cadet Miura?he casually inquired.Toni turned towards the man beside him.I was told that when I arrived at this carrier, I would find what remained of LOGIS, as well as a cadet in the custody of the military police.That cadets name is Ian Templeton.The lieutenant sighed.LOGIS was evacced from Lograin three days ago, including the Templeton boy.The carrier was then refitted for general evac and returned there.Your lieutenant came with us.We were told he was looking for a certain rotten egg who shot his nephew and got another cadet killed.The Templeton boy isnt under arrest, nor was he ever.He was sequestered for more than three days under threat of a firearm.You have a lot to answer for, boy.More than you can imagine, Toni muttered.Excuse me?Never mind, sir.Is it true that certain parts of an enemy Suit were found and secured?True.Although whatever that has to do with you is beyond me.It has nothing to do with me, Toni answered quietly as tears rolled down his cheeks.Lieutenant Templetons treachery shocked him beyond words, mostly because it had been so flawlessly executed.He had been smart, feeding the cadet tidbits of valid information and hiding the bait in between.And the blue berets had accosted him only as soon as the Quasar had become airborne.He supposed he was just an amateur who had just been outmaneuvered and cornered by professionals.Varano and Nievers had just been unfortunate.The system had won.Turning to look over his shoulder, he found a stony faced sergeant pointing a Miroku pistol at the base of his skull.The remainder of the passengers watched on silently, enraptured by the possibility of bloodshed.Sighing, Toni stared out the window and found that the aircrafts holding pattern had brought Lograin back into his field of view.The attack appeared to have ended and the base burned fiercely, thick black smoke streaking away to the far off sea, towards the dark, dead side of his beloved world.He wondered once more what true night must be like.Whatever possessed you to pick a fight with the Templetons?the officer asked quietly.I never did, sir.Theyve been picking one with me.You were a fool to put up a fight.I have my pride, sir.The officer slapped his hands on his lap and stood, beckoning him to do the same.Calmly Toni rose and, not needing to be told, he turned his back to the man and offered his wrists.The officer removed an old pair of handcuffs from his belt and began to bind him, speaking casually as he did so.Let us see what your pride has cost you, boy.Sergeant cadet Toni Miura, you are hereby arrested on grounds of incompetence, insubordination, grievous assault, false imprisonment and sequester, and you will remain in our custody until you have been duly court martialed.As he felt the cool steel sliding into place, listening to the officers damning words as the storm clouds outside mercifully blocked his vision of hell, Toni remembered Cosus, the war god, and the peace he had felt when he had prayed to him.Youre gonna be praying a lot more, mate, the stranger sneered, enchanted by the developments, better decide if it will be to the god of sheep or the god of war.Toni began to laugh as he realized to which one it would inevitably be.EPILOGUE      Leiben, 10H50, 21st of June, 2771      Criminal court judge Ken Hirano was nearing the end of his rope.Two weeks ago, a law had been hastily passed, granting criminal court judges the power to sentence convicted felons to compulsory service in the armed forces.Such a decision had seemed a little extreme even in the midst of the recent crisis, but after news had begun to surface of more than a hundred combat casualties in the mining quadrant, Ken had realized that such a decision was tantamount to a death sentence.Almost every judge of the criminal court circuit had flatly refused to pass such sentences, hoping that, as had happened so many times before, the council would understand that they had been hasty in passing the law, and allow it to be in effect tacitly revoked through sheer disregard for its tenets.Instead the Council had decided to enact Article Thirteen of the offending law.In an ultimate insult to any self respecting judge, the article called for attachs from the Military Justice Department to be appointed to assist at criminal trials, and to advise their civilian counterparts on the best way to go about fulfilling the Councils wishes.Lieutenant colonel Germano Gutierrez smiled at him as the moment for sentencing arrived, making plain his intention that the four youths accused of engaging in a street fight be inducted into the forces.Sighing heavily, Ken shook his head at the officer, and he thought hard on a justifiable reason to spare the boys as he watched Germanos smile grow daggers.Finally clearing his throat, Ken passed his ruling.It is the decision of this court that, on the day of the facts previously described, the four defendants engaged in the crime of public disorder.The fact that the defendants have accused each other of provoking the altercation is insignificant, since provocation as a justification does not legitimize the criminal act.In light of the proven facts, it is the decision of this court   He hesitated, aware that the colonel possessed the authority to usurp sentencing from his hands and make his own ruling, and finally decided upon a concession....that Donovan Lieberman and Rikku Thomasson, each being the elder of the opposing pair, be sentenced to no less than eight months of compulsory military service, with the possibility of said period being extended at the pleasure of his Excellency the Commander of the CDF.The decision carried through the courthouse like a sonic boom, and the looks of terror on the elder boys faces tore at his heart.Both families lost their composure, and it took the intervention of several members of the court Police to stop them from forcefully approaching his bench.The younger two, who had only recently finished high school and had good perspectives for higher studies, both collapsed into their seats as if by common agreement.Whatever their objections, Ken had no doubt that it had been the two older boys who had begun the fight.Wishing them well, he sentenced the remaining pair to eighty hours of community service each.The lieutenant colonel gave him a sly look and then followed with a discreet nod, and the beginnings of an understanding began to form between the two judges.Next case!Ken ordered.The bailiff squared her slim shoulders and leaned up to whisper to him.You honor, this next case is that queer one we were discussing yesterday ...The ...oh hell ...he remarked, remembering.Call the boys in.At the bailiffs soft beckoning, a rugged crew of eight young men trudged into the courtroom, followed by a squad of metropolitan policemen.The detainees sneered at the court officials as they entered and then gazed indolently at their surroundings.The last to enter was the smallest among their number, clothed in a trench coat a size too large for him.Lieutenant colonel Gutierrez watched the group like a hawk as they formed a line before the dock.Very well, Ken began, the case before us regards the group of young men known among police officers as the Pirates of the Periphery.I have come to know of this misfit group over the last few months due to their ...uh, activities.We will begin with a confirmation of your identities.The old judge read each youths name in turn, taking care to confirm home address and date of birth.He wasnt surprised to discover that the boy in the trench coat was the youngest of the group, at nineteen.The remainder ranged from twenty to twenty four years old, and all without exception hailed from the research stations.That was one of the unusual aspects of the group.Every gang he knew of was local, those hailing from the hubs usually arriving in town only for birth, study or employment.He turned to the man studying documents to his right.Prosecutor, please present your case.Thank you, your honor, the prosecutor said.On the eighteenth of June of the present year, a purported separatist movement known as Core Hack simultaneously hacked into the Leiben Metropolitan and Underground Transit Systems.The computing power for this act originated from the twelve computers of Leiben Varsitys Central Library, but by the time the Campus Policing Authority had made its appearance there, no one was to be found.Not even the librarian, it seems.However, the hack was ultimately successful only because two groups of varsity students infiltrated city administrative facilities and connected to terminals there, shutting down the systems and creating the wireless connections necessary for the hack to proceed.These groups, consisting of four students each, were subsequently arrested and stand before Your Honor today.And how was the arrest achieved?Ken inquired.The shutting down of the transit systems did not deactivate the installations security cameras.Metro and UTS security officials detected the intrusions and informed the LPD.Officers converged on both locations, Metro Administrative headquarters and UTS Services.Due to the UTS being of great proximity to LPD personnels sleeping lodges, an abundant number of off duty police officers made the arrest on location.The only problem was deciding who would get recognition for the arrests .The final tally of arresting officers was twenty six.Ken whistled at the number.Was there resistance?Who are the detainees from the UTS?Darryl Hikari, Fumio Fukitsu, Peter Kojima and Timothy Bowker.All four resisted vigorously, theyre members of Leiben Varsitys Kendo club, but apparently they dab in other arts as well.Seven injuries among the officers, the prosecutor finished with distaste.And what of the Metro group?They  the prosecutor suddenly stopped, and Ken was alarmed at the expression he saw there.Well?Perhaps it would be best if the senior arresting officer speaks about that, the prosecutor proposed carefully.Is there any particular reason why you shouldnt be able to explain that yourself?the judge asked, mystified.Indeed I read the documents pertaining to the arrests, and it was all so convoluted I have a few questions myself, the prosecutor answered in embarrassment.Very well, then, prosecutor.Please have the holographics of the security cameras set up.While this is done I will hear your officer.*****      Ken blinked as he digested the officers words.Sergeant chief Portento, could you run that last part by me again?The sergeant sighed and rubbed his shaven head.A tram.An electrical tra   With or without the passengers?With.How many passengers?Four hundred and fifty seven, Your Honor.The judge studied the sergeant for a few moments.He then laid his eyes upon the defendants, as if seeing them anew.The lieutenant colonel tisked, a delighted expression stamped on his face.What insane band of baboons would see fit to hijack a tramfulls worth of our nations citizens?!The sergeant cleared his throat.Eleven, sir.What?!Eleven tramfulls worth, sir.And they hacked it?That and other vehicles, Your Honor.Please continue.The sergeant rubbed his hands together, trying to remember where his story had been interrupted.Then it came to him.So when metro security informed us that the suspects were on the move towards Neumann Station, we raised camp and set south.Traffic was high so, in order to gain time and prevent accidents, we activated the Sudden Stop contingency.Could you explain that last part, Sergeant chief?the prosecutor interjected.When we request the Sudden Stop contingency to our radio central, they commandeer the ATS systems and paralyze all automated surface vehicles.They simply pull over to the curb and leave us free to move.And the hack wouldnt have prevented that?No, prosecutor.That system was not hacked.And this could not have been done with the metropolitan tram?No, prosecutor.That system was hacked, they could do what they wanted.So you activated the contingency ...the judge interrupted.Proceed with your testimony.Activating the contingency became part of the problem, the officer remarked angrily before continuing.When we got there, we surrounded the stations exits.We were about to make entry when we were swamped by the tram passengers.We found out fast that the suspects had already abandoned the location.Then one of my officers approached me.He had arrived from the 14th Precinct, opposite from our heading, and he told me that an ATS cab had passed him by when he was closing in.He hadnt thought much about it at the time, but then he remembered that no cab was supposed to be moving.And he also remembered the four young males who were inside the vehicle.No.Dont tell me ...the judge huffed in disbelief.Yes, Your Honor.They hacked the ATS cab ...the sergeant admitted, as if he himself were to blame.There were sniggers from within the group of defendants.The judge banged his gavel and bid all be quiet, warning of consequences if they were to test him again.He then asked the sergeant to continue.We came across the couple theyd kicked off the cab.When we activated the Sudden Stop, their vehicle came to a stop in front of Neumann station.They were simply waiting for the vehicles system to reactivate when the four showed up and threw them out.They literally threw them, Your Honor.Then the victims got mixed up with the throng of metro passengers and we only heard from them a minute later.We informed radio central of the development, and requested that personnel keep an eye out for any mobile ATS cabs.We then dispersed all over Leiben.Destiny had it that mine would be the patrol car to come across them.We found the fugitive vehicle grinding against almost every parked ATS cab on Eric Vandenburg street.Vandalism?No sir.The ATS cabs have no actual wheel to drive with, as you may well know.Our technicians explained that steering, accelerating and braking information to the cab is supplied by the vehicles CPU.The boy somehow managed to supply direct orders to the vehicle at real time speeds.And who is this boy youre speaking about?The sergeant pointed out the boy in the trench coat.That one.Isogu Kitsune.He looks like a high school boy but the others listen to him.Hes more of a troublemaker than he looks.Mister Kitsune was the Metropolitan tram driver and the ATS cab driver, he was imputing the instructions to both vehicles with a heavily modified qwerty keyboard.But as soon as we showed up and it became a pursuit, he simply wasnt able to type fast enough.The ATS cab managed to keep going another four hundred meters, and then it clipped two parked cars and hit a patrol car.How many injured?the judge asked.None.The vehicles officers had positioned it to block the road.They were outside the car, Your Honor.Did the defendants put up a fight?We didnt give them the chance.The collision left the suspects shaken up long enough for us to make the arrests without incident.What else can you tell us, Sergeant chief?The sergeant appeared indecisive for a brief moment, and then he clapped his hands determinedly together and began to speak.I know the group, Your Honor.The Pirates of the Periphery is the name we had for the group before we could put faces to their hacker aliases.We now know that they call themselves Core Hack, and that theyre a computer hacking community bent on enabling independence of the research hubs from centralized government.Within that community is a hard core of activists known as the Alphas.Our informants declare that this nucleus has command and control over the remainder, and that they consist of a group of eight individuals, mostly from the Terminator hub, just like the detainees present in this very   A choked guffaw interrupted his monologue.The judge instantly banged his gavel and ordered the offending defendant to be gagged.The attempt to gag the boy sent the remainder into laughing hysterics, and it took seven additional gags to put an end to the laughter.Once silence had been reestablished, Ken turned to Sergeant chief Portento, a severe expression set on his face.I hardly think the leaders of a movement would have exposed themselves in the way these fools have.How did you get by this information?he asked critically.The question put the sergeant on guard.Varsity sources, Your Honor.Surely theres no requirement for me to be more specific.There is not,  the judge decided after some thought.Your Honor, the Lieutenant colonel intruded, I am satisfied.Regarding the evidence presented against the defendants, I mean.Moreover, I agree with you about the supposed leadership role of these boys.These boys arent leaders, theyre adventurers.If they want a real adventure, Ive got one for them.I want them.All of them, the officer declared, his gaze fixed on Ken.The old judge grimaced, knowing the old soldier was right.He stared at the haughty youths, and his gaze paused on the boy with the trench coat.There was an almost vulnerable demeanor to him, as if a war would tear him apart in the first clash.Then he considered the sheer panic the city had suffered at their hands, and his heart began to harden.He thanked the police officer for his testimony and dispensed him from further questioning.He then cleared his throat and made his judgment.The defendants before me have managed to simultaneously paralyze the Metropolitan, Underground Transit and Automated Transit systems.Had this happened at the eve of the Great Rains, what might have happened?Hundreds would have been stranded above ground to brave the Winds at their most intense, and if the Rains had happened to pelt down at that time, how many would have been washed into the floodplains?Perhaps your friends took this into consideration or perhaps they didnt care.The people of Leiben have always been brother and sister to you, and now that the Earth born have arrived to put an end to all indigenous inhabitants, that truth is all the clearer now.At least for those sensible enough to see it.You young men seem not to have seen it.And blindness has consequences in the real world.The consequences in this case will be severe.Darryl Hikari, Fumio Fukitsu, Peter Kojima and Timothy Bowker.You are convicted of Civil Net piracy, qualified intrusion, sabotage, resistance and seven counts of qualified assault.You are sentenced to no less than two years of compulsory military service, with the possibility of said period being extended at the pleasure of his Excellency the Commander of the CDF.Wolfram Kurayami, Drakum Balog, Maderu Scindia and Isougo Kitsune.You are convicted of Civil Net piracy, qualified intrusion, sabotage, qualified damages, resistance, four hundred and fifty seven counts of sequester, wanton vandalism and two counts of simple assault and coercion.You are sentenced to no less than four years of compulsory military service, with the possibility of said period being extended at the pleasure of his Excellency the Commander of the CDF.He expected the storm to break.It did not.Several of the newly convicted smiled beneath their gags, while others merely appeared annoyed at the sentence.The boy in the trench coat maintained an impassive expression, and the old judge began to wonder about him.*****      The moment the judge wished them well, policemen removed the convicts gags and shushed them as soon as they began to complain.The group was then led away to the courthouse detention block to the buildings rear.The eldest among them smiled as they walked along, thinking of how it had all worked out.The Movements greatest weakness was not a lack of personnel.It was quality and training that they was lacking.Not one soldier, not one police officer, not even a fireman was to be found among them.They were a horde of overeducated undergraduates.It was that very dominant quality within Core Hack that had motivated the Wolf to form his own pack.Unfortunately, there was only one within it who possessed the intellect for elaborate planning.The remainder, if he was uncomfortably honest with himself, were little more than muscle.Which was why they were known as the Alphas.It was not a name they had chosen for themselves.It was the depiction the members of Core Hack had of them, a derogatory adjective that had slowly become a name.The Foxs recruitment had been meant to make up for that.As they entered the cell block where delinquents awaited transport to the army recruitment office, the Wolf gave the Fox a one armed bear hug and pulled him close.Sorry about this, Isougo, it looks like study time is over.The Fox shrugged.Thank the gods.I was sick of it any way.Do you realize how fortunate we are?The Wolf smiled from his two meter frame, letting loose a chuckle at the thought.Free training and operational experience.Access to weaponry and ammunition.This is a wet dream for me.Whats your analysis?The Fox furrowed his brow as he thought on the matter, ignoring the congratulatory slaps his pack mates were laying into his back.It would be inconvenient if we were all to die.We need to volunteer for different operational units.And   No, my hasty fox.We need to stick together.I know it would be more rewarding information wise if we were to separate, but youre not considering that we are a pack.So, what do you think of the earthlings in all this?The Fox peered up at his senior with a quizzical expression.You know well that the people from the hubs will be used as cannon fodder against the earthborn.Well simply have to defeat them.And then we can finish what they started when they tried to level Leiben.The Wolf grinned and leaned down to his juniors ear.It seems my hasty fox has unwittingly become a wolf.Good for you.
