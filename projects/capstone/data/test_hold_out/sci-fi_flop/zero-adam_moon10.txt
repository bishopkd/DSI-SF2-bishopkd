Luckily, the prisoners didnt find me first, or else Id be in pieces right now.The convoy that brought me in was reduced from a dozen armored trucks to just two.I was lucky enough to be in one of those two.Air support is nonexistent on Ishca.The prisoners take particular delight in taking aircraft down, and theyre good at it too.We drove through a shanty town made up of various aliens.Some were Cogmores; some of them looked like these weird spiders with orange heads and little pink feet.Some were so small the others ate them.There were a bunch of green guys and gray dudes.They all looked pissed or tired.None of them looked that happy to be alive.And I found out why pretty quickly.The Beetars tormented them and then, just as they reached their breaking point, we would get sent in to quell the violence.As soon as we had a situation under control, the Beetars would instigate another uprising.It was orchestrated murder with the Beetars pulling the strings.It gave them plausible deniability if anyone cared to ask why so many prisoners were dying every single day.My ass was put on the line several times a day needlessly.I felt like my life was worthless.Thats why Ive come to hate them.She let out a long sigh.I need a charge.Wake me if you need me.Then she stood up and shuffled off.As soon as she hooked up to the port and her head drooped, he said to Stacey, Youre going to finish telling me whats going on.I dont have the energy.Can it wait?Are you kidding?Of course it cant.Stacey sat back, making sure not to damage the cable jutting from her back.Henshaw wanted to explain this to you, but he wanted you to experience the empire for yourself first.The Beetars are evil, Zero, just like you suspected.And Henshaw is one of their human collaborators.But hes been left alone for decades doing their bidding, and in that time hes been conspiring against them.He set up a base of operations on the moon his space station orbits, and hes repurposed tons of the Beetars supplies for his own use.But you are his lifes work.You are the beginning of the end of the Beetars supremacy as far as hes concerned.Thats why you are so different from the rest of us.He built you to be able to defend yourself in any situation, which is why your gun hatches dont work like everyone elses.Its why you never truly go offline when you charge.He didnt want you to be vulnerable.Its also why he took out your kill switch.He built your body to stand up to the Beetars.But he couldnt convince you to fight for him with mere words.He knew how worthless that would be.He wanted you to experience the atrocities firsthand.He wanted you to be fueled with the same hatred that fuels him.Zero shook his head.This was bullshit.But he must have believed some of it, because he didnt stand up and walk away.Whats so important about me, then?Technically, nothing is special about you.But your body has been modified; its the body thats unique.Thats why you arrived late in orbit around Cogmore.When Henshaw learned youd be stationed there, he told me he was going to hold you back to install their language in you so you could communicate with them.He nodded.Just because he didnt remember it didnt mean the doctor hadnt installed the language while he was shut down.It made some sense too.He could communicate with Cogmores when no one else could.She continued, But when he built you, he couldnt replicate all the tests youd experience on Epigog 31.Thats why you washed out of training.The gun hatches he rigged to open even in the company of Beetars failed to open during training.When he found out you wouldnt get to advance through training, he got desperate.You see, he had to make sure you got out in the galaxy.He had to ensure you fulfilled your role, and you would never get that chance if you were stuck guarding the training center for years.Zero recalled the destruction of the training camp.He remembered finding all of the mechs dead and their human trainers in bloody pieces.He remembered Commander Delacourt writing in his own blood moments before he died.He wrote, Get Henshaw, as Zero loomed over him.Hed assumed he wanted a doctor, but he had misunderstood.Delacourt was telling him to go after Henshaw.He was letting him know Henshaw was responsible for his death.As if to confirm his suspicions, Stacey said, Henshaw had no choice.He had to wipe out all records of you failing.He had to use his secret fleet to destroy the camp and everyone inside.That way he could make up a lie to get you stationed elsewhere in the empire.I cant believe hed go to all of that effort just for me, he said.You have to understand that your body was the culmination of years of study and experimentation.He worked on your unit for too long to just watch it wither on Epigog without fulfilling its destiny.He doesnt have the option of telling me what my destiny is.Im not his puppet.He knew that.Thats why he set you loose in the empire, to find out for yourself just what needed to be done to right the wrongs of the Beetars.His head hurt.It was too much information to take in all at once.Stacey had been right when she warned him he wouldnt want to know her secrets.He sat forward.If those blue alien ships that destroyed camp were built by Henshaw, then what the hell are they doing swarming this warship now?Theyre tracking its position and getting ready for you to make your move.A question was on the very tip of his tongue when an earth shattering siren blared.A Beetar voice issued over the speakers.Weve arrived among the hostile alien fleet.Humans, get ready to fight.Stacey gave him a fearful look.Its too soon.You dont know enough.You need to hear from Henshaw.How am I supposed to do that?He has a prerecorded message he built into you.Its supposed to activate the moment your outrage becomes unbearable.In it hell explain everything.Is there a way to manually turn it on?There is, but we dont have the time.We need to attack those ships.But those ships are Henshaws, right?They are.Theyre on our side.But we need to go through the motions or the Beetars will find out were conspiring against them before youre ready.He huffed.Im still not on board with that.I only just started to see them in a different light.You met one decent Beetar.That doesnt mean theyre all good.He shook his head.He couldnt take down more than a few Beetars on this warship before they took him out anyway.If this was Henshaws plan, it had some serious flaws.In a way, he hated Stacey for telling him.But hed barely had time to dwell on it when Piss pants and Volts came rushing into the room.Piss pants looked at the cable connecting them and said, Unplug and come with me.Were going out there whether we like it or not.Volts looked scared.Were going out just like this.Theyre sending us out without a ship.Zero stood up and unplugged the cable from his back.Can they do that?Can we maneuver in space?He genuinely did not know the answer to that.I dont know.They just said to do it.Ill go first, but if nothing happens and I drift away helplessly, you guys need to refuse to go out there.Piss pants started to move towards Eve, but they stopped him.Shes low on juice.Let her charge up.I dont know if theyll let me do that.They said all of us had to fight.Stacey said, Im still our personal liaison with the Beetars.If they want to blame someone for it, they can blame me.Shes not fit to be among us or them in the state shes in.Piss pants turned about and ran out of the room.Hurry up, then.Theyre expecting us to join the fight.Zero felt the first impact as it rocked the ship.Stacey put a hand on his shoulder when they were the last ones left in the room.Dont hold back.The Beetars need to believe we can be trusted.He smirked.I wasnt going to hold back.Those drones killed some of my friends, including you.Theyre going to pay for it.I dont care if Henshaw built them for that very purpose.Stacey said, Theres more to it than that but he was already running down the corridor away from her.There was a lot he did not know.He didnt know if he was one of the good guys, he didnt know if hed ever get put back inside his body, and he didnt know if he could believe a word Stacey said.But he did know that those drones had killed people he knew, and he wanted to exact revenge on them.He had a singular purpose, which felt good considering everything Stacey had just dumped on him.He got to the docking bay just in time to see Volts crawling inside a small hatch.Piss pants shut the hatch behind him and they waited.A clicking meant the outside hatch had been opened and Volts had been sucked out into space.He had no idea how to tell if Volts was alright.They waited with bated breath until they heard a very faint tapping coming from outside.To get through the hull of the ship he mustve been hammering with all of his might.Piss pants said, Thats him.Hes okay.Whos next?Zero stepped forward just as Stacey put her hand on his shoulder.He shrugged it off and waited for the hatch to open again.It did, and he crawled inside the cramped space, feeling more like a torpedo than a living creature.He was afraid, but he was just as afraid to stay behind and listen to Stacey explain his destiny to him, or the twisted, convoluted plans Henshaw had for the Beetars.He couldnt take any more intrigue.He had to be alone and it didnt get much lonelier than being in the vacuum of space.His gun hatches opened and he got ready to fight.The outside door opened and he and all the gasses surrounding him were sucked toward the hatch, into space.He saw only black, with faint grey trace gasses shooting past him.He felt something grasp his leg and saw Volts with his boosters lit up, holding him steady.Volts entire body was issuing gasses and flames.He moved towards Zero and put his lips against his ears.Try and move around.We have more than just boot boosters.Theyre all over us.His voice was faint and distant, like he was talking through tin cans connected by a string.Volts had to send the vibrations directly to his ears, as sound doesnt travel in a vacuum.Zero concentrated on trying to move about, and immediately little jets slid out from small doors all over his body and started to spew gasses, jostling him around like a buoy.Just then, the hatch in the ship closed and behind them a tiny blue object zipped past.He doubted they could match the drones speed, but they had to try.Turrets somewhere above them fired at the blue ship, but it was just too fast.He could only guess, but if the mechs had any value in this battle, it was probably to lure or distract the blue ships long enough for the turrets to zero in.He hated to be used as bait, but in this instance he was fine with it.Those drones needed to be destroyed.He didnt care that they were some mad scientists invention.He didnt care that they wouldnt fear their own destruction or feel pain when they blew up.They had to go.Volts said, You go.Ill stay and get the others ready.Zero smiled.He was glad Volts had chose to let him fight.He wanted to do some damage.Volts slapped him on the back.Get some payback for what they did to Creaker, Stomper, and Twitch.Ill be right behind you.Save some for me.He liked Volts enthusiasm.The blue drones had killed his friends too.He felt the same outrage Zero felt.This was going to be fun.He put his boots against the hull of the ship and kicked off with everything he had.He was faster than hed anticipated, which took some getting used to.He followed the line of fire coming from the turret cluster on top of the warship and found the little blue ship it was tracking.He thrust his body towards it.It must have been too preoccupied with the turret to see him coming because it didnt react until he started shooting.Each round missed, which pissed him off, but his aim was getting truer when it suddenly twisted in place and then shot off at an incredible speed hed never match.He looked all around in the black, trying to lock in on anything blue.He saw Piss pants and Volts speeding towards another drone, so he gave chase too.He had to avoid the turret fire as he neared.Volts was letting the blue ship have it as Piss pants kept it contained.When he arrived, the ship was boxed in between them and the turret fire, so instead of trying to escape it started fighting back.Zero was hit, but he didnt sustain any damage.He fired his guns, only remembering at the last second that his ammo was upgraded.Each hit exploded noiselessly, knocking the blue ship around like a piata.Volts and Piss pants both stared at him as he fired round after round into the drone.The ship tried to bull rush him, but he unloaded on it, tearing it in half before it reached him.Gasses rushed from it into the vacuum.He got out of the way of the escaping debris.Then he saw something that confused him.A body floated from the ship, nearly concealed by the large chunks of metal, but it was undeniably human.A human being suffocating right before his eyes.He didnt understand.He thought the ships created by Henshaw were drones  but there were human pilots flying them.Hed just killed a man.It made no sense.He tried to turn, but found his motion sluggish.His system fluids were freezing in the cold of space.His body started to tumble end over end, out of control as he seized up.Volts and Piss pants grabbed him and started to take him back to the Beetar ship.He wasnt so sure he appreciated it.At that moment, he wanted to be left to die.He was so confused.They shoved him into the outer hatch.A moment later Stacey was dragging him into the ship.She stared at him as she laid him down at her feet.What happened?He stammered, I got one.She cocked her head to the side, waiting to see if hed elaborate.He said, Human beings are inside those ships.I thought they were drones.She looked at him with pity.Theyre not drones.Youre lucky to be alive.I dont think the Beetars wouldve cared much if I froze solid out there.Youre right.I need to get the others back inside before they freeze over.While I do that, Im going to activate Henshaws recording so you know everything.Its time.You need to be ready for this.She reached inside the nape of his neck and fiddled around.He knew immediately when she activated the recording.Part 6:  Henshaws Deceit    His vision shut down.A split second later, everything changed.He was staring at Doctor Henshaws face.Hed assumed it would just be a voice recording, but the doctor had gone all out with it.It was some type of virtual reality.He was standing in the doctors lab on the space station.Henshaw stared at him and said, Hello, Jack.This is Doctor Henshaw.I assume youve come to the same conclusion that I have: that the Beetars are evil and need to be stopped.Thats where you come in.You will be the instrument that takes them down.Let me start from the beginning.He knew that Stacey was pulling Volts and Piss pants inside the ship right beside him, but he couldnt see it or feel or hear it.He was completely immersed in the experience.Henshaw said, Theyve forced me to help them for decades  and Ive had enough.You may not know this yet, but your body was not dying.Thats a trick the Beetars used to gain your subservience.In fact, your body isnt inside a machine, being healed on this space station.You are alive and well.This next part might blow your mind: your body is not immobile and unconscious here.The consciousness I transferred to your unit was a copy.Your human alter ego is working for the resistance that I created.In fact, at some point in the future, you may meet your real self.Zeros mind was doing back flips.This changed everything.If he was just a copy, there was no way to get his body back, because his body was already whole.He was a floating consciousness with nothing to link him to a life he could understand.He didnt have time to cry or mourn his loss.Henshaw was too busy filling the void with words.Now, normally, the Beetars make me kill new arrivals right after I transfer a copy of their minds, but I set up a base on the moon Im orbiting by uploading my own consciousness into a mech.Years ago I put that mech to work setting up the base behind the Beetars backs.Ever since it became habitable, I started saving recruits rather than killing them.I send them down there to live and hide and train.Ive created a fleet of ships, one of which youll end up pilotingas a human of course.It took him a second to wrap his head around that.But my most prized creation was you, Jack.When a mech has been in service for a couple of years, the Beetars shut it off and ship it back to me to upload another consciousness into it.They do that because recruits start to question everything eventually.I managed to put your unit aside instead of putting it back into the field and I spent nearly three years tinkering with it and perfecting it.The Beetars no longer have the ability to control you.You are the only mech who has free will and can act upon it.And I hope you will.Henshaw reached towards him, and at the last second Zero realized he was really reaching for the camera.The doctor grabbed it and pivoted it to the right, pointing it down at a sleeping man on a table.Zero was looking at himself, in human form.Ive already uploaded a copy of your consciousness into your mech.This is the real you lying on this table.Instead of flushing your unconscious body out into the void of space like the Beetars have instructed, Im going to revive you and send you to the moon with the others.I hope you can appreciate that.I understand you must be conflicted now.I understand how saddened you must be to know youll never be reunited with your flesh.Please try to understand that the alternative was supposed to be far worse than this.The Beetars use your minds to control their mechs, then they have me destroy your bodiesand then, when theyre done with you, they turn you off like a light.I think Ive given you a better option than that.I hope you can find a way to see it too.If you decide to go up against them, know that you are not alone.I am poised to strike at a moments notice.The Beetars think were their pets.Theyve underestimated our ingenuity and courage.That will be their downfall.Good luck to you, Jack.If at any time, you need to hear this message again, theres a switch concealed in the nape of your neck.Activate it and the message will start over.Goodbye.The image flickered and vanished and his eyesight returned.The Beetar Quiss was standing in front of him when his vision returned.What happened to you?You were unresponsive.Stacey stood behind him with Piss pants and Volts.His system fluids froze over from being in space too long, she lied.They just now thawed out.Hes fine.Quiss seemed to buy it.He said to all of them, You will no longer be needed out there.In the time it took you to destroy one ship, weve taken out a dozen.The turret gunners were complaining that you kept getting in the way anyway.Return to your quarters until youre called upon.He turned with a flourish and walked away briskly.He seemed more animated than ever.Zero wondered if his spirits were raised because of the war happening outside.Beetars were a warlike species, so this was probably fun to them.Stacey whispered to everyone, Lets go somewhere private.Zero has something he needs to explain to the rest of you.Volts and Piss pants gawked at him suspiciously.He shook his head and started walking.How could he explain everything to them?He barely understood it himself.He didnt want to see the looks on their faces when they found out they had no hope of ever being human again.Outside the big bay window was utter mayhem.Bullets whizzed and debris tumbled, but his mind was too numb for the magnitude of it to sink in.Humans were dying out there, but his addled brain didnt understand how that was even possible.Eve was gone when they got back.He could only guess that shed woken up and wandered off when she couldnt find any of them.He sat down at the table and the others joined him there.Stacey looked at him with concern in her eyes.She mouthed the words, Im sorry.He didnt blame her though.She was as doomed as the rest of them.He said, It turns out that we wont  wont get to go back to our bodies.Piss pants stood up and said, Did they die?What happened?Believe it or not, our bodies are out there in those blue ships attacking this ship.None of them believed him, which struck him as odd since they had been out there when hed blown up that blue ship.Maybe they didnt see the dead human emerge from the wreckage, or maybe they chalked it up to a trick of the imagination.Volts said, Tell us exactly what youre talking about.Zero watched the looks of disbelief turn to horror as he explained everything the doctor had just relayed to him in his message.A couple of times they felt the ship shudder as he spoke, but the chaos didnt sidetrack them.They were too mesmerized by his story and he was too caught up in it himself to be distracted.But a sliver of a thought slid into his brain: while they were sitting around trying to figure this all out, humans were dying out there.Some of them might even be their own alter egos.When he was done, Stacey said, Back on Epigog, when Zero insisted that the doctor revive me after my mech was destroyed in training, Henshaw contacted me with a proposition.I was in his hidden base on the moon, training to battle Beetars.He asked me if I was willing to let him copy my consciousness again to have it transferred back into a mech.I didnt like the idea.Its risky copying a mind.The original has a good chance at survival the first time, but it drops to ten percent if its attempted again.My human form would be lucky to survive it.That explained why the Beetars didnt just find the perfect soldier and copy him or her endlessly.It was a question that had bugged him from the beginning, but he had been too stupid to put into words.She continued, But if I agreed to do it, my copied consciousness would know too much.I would know the trickery of the Beetars.I would know that I had no chance of ever being reunited with my flesh.So at first I refused.I thought it would be too much for my copied consciousness to bear.But the doctor convinced me in the end.I dont know what story he gave you guys, but thats what he did.At the time, Zero hadnt questioned the doctors elaborate lie.He had been just so overjoyed to have her back.Stacey said, The pain and anguish you feel now is the pain Ive been carrying around since the moment I awoke.He made me swear to keep it to myself.Ive been suffering in silence ever since.He could only imagine the loneliness she must have felt.He asked, Did your human body survive the second transfer?He hoped the answer was yes.If not, then his actions killed her human form.It did.Thank God.To everyone, she said, Im sorry I couldnt tell you any of this sooner.Piss pants stomped to the other end of the room.Maybe you shouldnt have told us at all, then.Volts yelled at him.She didnt do this to us!The doctor isnt to blame either.The Beetars did this.Stacey whispered, I dont know what kind of life we can even have like this, but its better than the alternative.Piss pants came back and sat down.He started to sob, even though no tears came out.He blubbered, All I am is an operating system.Thats no kind of life I can understand.Stacey put her arm over his shoulder.With time youll get used to it.He asked, Cant we be inserted into our bodies anyway?Cant they just be uploaded over the top of our alternate consciousnesses?It was a desperate question.Stacey said, It doesnt work like that.Even if your human body was willing, youd have to instantly grow synapses to accommodate all of your new memories.Thats impossible.Zero asked, So what now?Are you ready to fulfill your destiny?Nope.Then well wait until you are.But if the Beetars find out those ships out there are being flown by humans, itll be too late for us to act.Volts said, So why are we here?Are we Zeros sidekicks or something?Or are we just fodder?There was genuine, deep resentment in his voice.Stacey said angrily, None of you are supposed to even be here.The only reason Henshaw spared you was because of your close proximity to Zero on Epigog.If it wasnt for that, your mechs would be in a scrap pile in the desert of an alien planet.He hated to hear her explain it like that, so he could only imagine how much it must have hurt Volts to hear the truth.Just then, a Beetar voice came over the loudspeakers.Humans, report to the command hub immediately.Stacey said, Shit.This might be it.Be ready.Damn it.This was not going to end well.When they entered the Beetar section of the ship, they knew something was wrong.Three Beetars appeared behind them, pointing guns at their backs.Stacey whispered to Zero, Are you ready yet?He didnt know the answer.He wasnt ready to do this, but he might not have a choice.By the time they made it to the command hub, there were ten Beetars behind them.Twenty or more Beetars formed a wall in front of them, and standing in front of the Beetars was Eve.She was trembling.At first Zero thought she was trembling with fear, but on second glance it was obvious she was shaking with anger.Behind them, Beetars still manned their stations, caught up in the battle raging outside.A large fellow pointed at Eve.Had to be Captain Flimfor.He said, This unit acted towards my men with aggression.When they tried to subdue it, it pulled a gun on them.Sure enough, Eves empty holster was slung over her shoulder.Flimfor continued.It is regretful that you all must be shut down.We can not fight on while we worry about the mental state of our servants.So that was the gist of it.They saw them as slaves who were no longer useful to them, so they were going to shut them all off.Flimfor held a device out at them, paused, and then he pushed a button.He looked at them in confusion and then he pressed it again.Then he hit the side of it with his hand and pressed one last time.Urgently Flimfor said to the other Beetars, The kill switch isnt working.Somethings wrong.Take them down.Zero heard and felt the first shot hit his body in the same moment.He whirled around and lashed out, knocking the shooter into the wall.He heard Eve scuffling with the group that held her, and turned in time to see her wrench her gun away from them.She fired into the crowd as they rushed her.Stacey yelled, Get them, and they moved as a unit.He concentrated on helping Eve.He pulled his gun and killed four Beetars before they knew what was happening.The concussions from his illegal bullets dazed them senseless.He heard one of them yell, Hes accessed his guns.Thats not possible.Whats happening?He killed that guy before he could scream any more.Flimfor ran off like a coward before any of them could stop him.Zero aimed at his back when a Beetars body hit him in the chest, knocking him back.Volts had thrown him.He said, Sorry, man.Dont worry about it.He fired at the guy coming up behind Volts, blowing him to pieces.He saw Eve pulling the trigger on her gun, but shed unloaded it already.She threw it on the floor disgustedly and grabbed the nearest Beetar.She hit it so hard that it died on impact.Piss pants had two of them cornered.Zero shoved past him and fired two shots center mass.Stacey left the fight to secure the Beetars at their consoles before they decided to join in.She yelled over the commotion, Watch out!He has an EMP weapon.Zero was shocked to see it.EMPs knock out electronics.Maybe the weapon somehow directed the electromagnetic pulse so as not to affect the ship; otherwise it would be suicide to use it around their own tech.Either way, they were safe.Theyd already shielded themselves against EMPs.They all stopped and turned to see the Beetar with the EMP.He had a wicked grin as he walked towards them, the weapon raised.It looked like a fat rifle.Zero wasnt intimidated.He pointed his gun at the Beetar and pulled the trigger.The Beetar pulled the trigger on his EMP weapon right before he exploded into splattery chunks.Zero was dazed from the pulse, but was regaining his composure quickly.The mechs sustained volley after volley of gunfire from the surrounding Beetars as they stood there dazed and unable to move.He saw his friends all twitching in place, but he was happy none of them had died yet.He was the first to snap out of it, probably because he had the better cable shielding.He fired successive shots, hitting a line of Beetars, killing them on contact.His fellow mechs shook it off and got back to work beside him.Stacey hit a Beetar so hard that its head caved in.The horror of it should have shocked him, but he was too busy fighting for his life to dwell on it for more than a fraction of a second.She picked up the EMP weapon and broke it in half over her knee.He wheeled around to see Piss pants on the floor.Three Beetars stood over him, unloading their weapons into him, his body shuddering with each impact.Zero lifted his gun and blew them apart in a matter of seconds, but he was too late.Piss pants was already dead.Volts and Eve rushed to their fallen friend.When he didnt respond, they went nuts and flew into a blood rage like hed never seen before.Eve rushed away and ripped a Beetars head clean off.Hed never seen anything so brutal.Volts used his thrusters to burn two others to death.Zero slipped on Beetar blood, throwing his aim off as he fired, causing him to accidentally kill a Beetar who was peacefully sitting at his console.The console sparked and the lights flickered.The remaining Beetars then tried to escape.With no remorse, he shot them as they ran, spraying their blood across the room in a fine mist that soon covered everything.A Beetar yelled out, We surrender, so they stopped killing them, although Eve and Volts looked like they didnt want to.The Beetar whod surrendered was none other than Captain Flimfor himself.Hed been hiding back behind a console the entire time.He heard guns clatter as the Beetars dropped them at their feet.Stacey rounded up the survivors against the wall just as a flood of Beetars rushed in through the door from their living quarters.When the new arrivals saw that just seven Beetars were left standing, they threw their guns down and put their hands up.Volts herded them over to the others.One of the Beetars said condescendingly, If you dont let us get back to our workstations, those ships will destroy us all.Stacey said, Those ships are piloted by humans.The Beetar opened its mouth and then closed it again.Its surprise was obvious.Eve asked Stacey, What do you mean?Well fill you in as soon as were sure this ship is ours.Zero went to the turret control bubble in the center of the room and dragged out the two Beetars hiding inside.Then Stacey sent Volts and Eve out to make sure no others were hiding around the ship.To his surprise, they brought back dozens more.All of them were equal parts confused and outraged.But they were compliant, and that was all that mattered.One of the new arrivals snarled, You fight for nothing.All of you are already dead.That creepy human doctor flushed your bodies into space the moment he uploaded your minds.Stacey smiled with mock sweetness.He didnt.None of you know the truth.It smiled back and said, It doesnt matter.Before I was captured, I destroyed your charging ports.Youll all fade away before the end of the day and then well take our ship back.Stacey shook her head.Be careful, Beetar.Were smarter than you give us credit for.She looked at Zero and winked.So from now on, it was his job to power every mech.He was fine with that, so long as his battery did what it was supposed to do.Eve said sheepishly, Why does it feel like we just caused a galactic war?Volts said jokingly, What do you mean?We didnt do it.You started all of this.Before she could retort, Stacey said, This was inevitable.Im just glad its over.As if on cue, the ship rocked from the attack occurring outside.Stacey turned her attentions to the large, bullet riddled monitor.We need to get word to them that were in control of the ship.Volts threatened the Beetars.Send a message or well start executing you, one by one.A volunteer Beetar was led to her console.She said, All I can do is send the message.I cant guarantee theyll get it.Do it.Speak here, she said, pointing at the microphone.They took fire for another half an hour before a human voice issued over the speakers.We just received your message.Let us board you.Stacey said into the microphone, Well open the dock.Stacey and Volts went to greet their guests while Eve helped Zero watch over the prisoners.He was almost as nervous about meeting the new arrivals as he had been fighting the Beetars.Eve leaned towards him and said, Thank God for you.Without you, we would have all died.Everyone did their fair share.No they didnt.I killed a few of them before my ammo ran out, but after that I was at a disadvantage.If you hadnt done the bulk of the work, wed be in their position, or worse.She pointed at the Beetars.He was baffled.Maybe in all the commotion hed underestimated his contribution.She asked, Where the hell did you get your ammo from?I got it on Dosia.She nodded and then added, You know, if we hadnt copied your shielding wed all be dead.He shrugged.He took no pride in the compliment because he hadnt installed it, the doctor had.It started to sink in that he was important to their victory.Without his gun access, his specialty ammo, and his shielding, theyd have succumbed to Beetar might.And without his never ending battery, theyd all die, having no charging ports to recharge.The doctor had made him especially to beat the Beetars, and circumstances had supplied the rest.Stacey and Volts walked in with three dozen small humans in tow.He spotted Stacey, the human version, right away.He thought he recognized a couple of other faces, but he couldnt be sure.The human Stacey walked up to him and punched him in the abdomen.It didnt hurt physically.He reflexively took a step back.Why did you do that?You killed Dan, you asshole.Volts stepped forward and said, Did you say Dan is dead?Dan Stevenson?Yeah, three of you killed him.I saw it myself, so dont deny it.There was deep anguish to his voice as Volts said, His mech died too.He pointed at Piss pants mech body on the floor.We didnt know who we were fighting when we killed him.He barely remembered that Piss pants real name was Dan.That meant that when he blew up Dans ship, with Piss pants help, Piss pants had technically helped to kill himself.It was a strange irony that saddened him.Human Stacey pursed her lips and punched him again.She was clearly the leader of her group.Mech Stacey stepped forward and grabbed the other Stacey by the arm.If you do that again, youll regret it.Human Stacey shrugged her off and said to the whole room, We lost many, but in the end we succeeded.Eve said over the top of her, You didnt do shit.Without Zero, youd still be out there getting picked apart by turret fire.Zero won this battle.She pointed at him and he noticed Volts and mech Stacey nodding in agreement.Human Stacey took a close look at him.Youre Jack, arent you?Im not surprised you prevailed.You were designed with victory in mind.He nodded.Wheres the other me?He didnt see his handsome human face in the crowd.She looked at her feet.He died out there.Im so sorry.He saw her eyes mist up.Mech Stacey put her arm around the human Stacey.Im so sorry to hear that.How are you holding up?Human Stacey shook her head, but she said nothing.She was clearly close to his dead doppelganger.Then Mech Stacey saw him standing there looking confused.She said reassuringly, If you need someone to talk to, Im here for you.He nodded, because he didnt know what to say.Its not every day you find out youre already dead.But the truth was that it didnt change anything.That body was no longer his own anyway.Human Stacey said to them, Tell the Beetars they have a choice.They can help us pilot this ship to Epigog, or they can die horribly.Eve asked, Why are we going to Epigog?To pick up the doctor.Why?Because he found out where planet Beetar is located.Were going to take the fight to them.
