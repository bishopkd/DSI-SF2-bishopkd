But God does not allow anyone to suffer in vain.Large scale social upheavals are necessary for progress.Like a forest fire clears away the undergrowth to allow new plants to grow, or how a mass extinction allows new species to fill the vacant niches.Wars, revolutions and dark ages clear away stagnant and corrupt incumbent institutions so that new ones may take their place.If such institutions are not cleared away they hinder progress, sometimes even stop it all together.To quote one of your ancestors, When a man knows hes to be hung in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.When a man knows he has thousands of years to piss away, he too often does little else.We immortals are a passive breed.We are complacent with merely existing, and are seldom driven to accomplish anything.Without the encroachment of death to motivate us, we are indolent.This applies even to Humanity.Though as individuals you often live centuries longer than your ancestors, as a whole your species has grown complacent.Without death, there is no evolution; only stagnation.In the last ten thousand years the Scraumudi have had no wars, no revolutions, and no dark ages.Its possible that none of them have even died, thus leaving no room for the young to implement change.That is to say if there are any young.For all I know no new Scraumudi have been created.If thats so, none of them have been young for a very long time.How are Scraumudi created?Sook yin asked.Wholly artificially.They compile nucleic acids from bioreactors into zygotes based on genetic and epigenetic templates, Drkp replied.As is always the case with artificial reproduction, many of these embryos do not make it to term, and embryos that would have any congenital defects too severe for the Chrysalises to manage are intentionally aborted.Fewer than one embryo in a thousand is deemed healthy enough to become a Scraumudi.These lucky few develop for several months and emerge physically and mentally mature.They have no personal memories at that point, but everything they need to know has been genetically encoded to them.Sook yin shook her head.Why do multi millenarian races always seem to think that getting rid of sex is a good thing?she asked.I dont get it.Maybe if Levanoch out there didnt have to worry about living forever without having an orgasm he wouldnt be so pissed off.Arachnid smirked, but steered the conversation back to Drkp.So you are certain that the Scraumudi havent advanced since you put them in here?she asked.Yes.Their civilization is as unchanging as my own, he replied.Besides, their biogenic technology reached its limit long ago.Theres not even any room for advancement.I have a question about the Telarri, Helena said.They must have transmutated all the matter in this system into whatever they made the ring world out of.So why is this planet still here?Drkp shrugged.It is aesthetically pleasing.One does not chop down a blossoming tree for firewood, He replied.Though I would assume they did use its moons.I have another question; how did you create this place?Helena asked.Shortly after we had settled Reticuli, the Scraumudi began launching raids against us.Drkp began.They were most eager to get their claws on our technology.During one such raid Erinel the Downfallen, the last valiant King of the ancient and gallant Draconians, came to our aid.It was from him we learned that the Scraumudi had been plundering worlds in the Milky Way for millennia.We agreed the devastation had to end.We formed an alliance with the Draconians, and any other race we could, to defend the Galaxy from the Scraumudi.The Serpent War, which is what we called our long conflict with the Scraumudi, lasted for seventy seven years, Drkp continued.It was long and bitter, and we always seemed to be in a stalemate with them.Finally the entire alliance decided that for the good of the Galaxy, perhaps even all the Universe, the Scraumudi must be gotten rid of.Most people wanted them wiped out.We however had an alternative to genocide.We have these large devices we call gravity buoys.We encircle a star system with thousands of them, and they create immensely powerful and specialized gravitational fields in concert with each other so that they function like hyperluminal fields.This creates a colossal Gravity Bubble around the star system, allowing us to transport it at hyperluminal speeds.You can move stars through the Universe at faster than light speeds?Ilene asked in amazement.Drkp, disappointed in her ignorance, did not respond.We had determined with prior experiments that through using gravitational fields specialized to the task, it was possible to induce a region of space to split off from the Universe, forming its own baby universe.We realized our gravity buoys were capable of generating such fields, meaning we had the ability to banish an entire star system from the Universe.The only problem with this plan was the time it would take to deploy the required number of buoys.The Scraumudi would notice that we were doing something, though they wouldnt know what, and stop us.So, the full war fleets of every race in our alliance engaged the Scraumudi Armada in their system, as a diversion.It was the largest battle Id ever been a part of.I know you may think that a bioship may not have much over a real warship, but as youve seen theyre huge; bigger than most of the ships we had.And we were outnumber, outgunned, and outflanked.Its a good thing that battle was only a diversionary tactic; otherwise we surely would have lost.As the battle waged on, and many thousands of brave Sapient beings lost their lives, we clandestinely deployed the gravity buoys, each one cloaking seconds after it was released.Once everything was in place, we and the entire fleet got the hell out of that system.I imagine Nakhash standing by a window, then tossing back his head and laughing with contempt at our feeble attack on his ring world and our cowardly retreat.Then he looks back out the window, and sees that the stars are gone.We had done it.The Scraumudi were gone forever.There was much celebrating that night.Any ships not in the system at the time were easy to hunt down and destroy.The wormholes were an unintentional by product.There was nothing we could do about them.That is all I can think of right now.Do you have any other questions?No I think weve heard enough, Marc replied.Once we leave this planets atmosphere well be vulnerable to attack until we can escape its gravity well.For all we know were completely surrounded by bioships right now.If that is the case, its fairly likely well be disabled before we have a chance to go hyperluminal, at which point we will be boarded.We need to decide what were going to do if that should happen.Maybe we should self destruct, Magnolia suggested timidly.We dont have a self destruct sequence, Ilene stated.Maybe not, but there must be some way we could rig the Q vac reactors to blow up, Magnolia said.Or we could set all the torpedoes off inside the  There are hundreds of people aboard this ship.Some of them are minors!Sook yin protested.How can you even think of killing them?If what Drkp says is true than we cant let the Scraumudi get a hold of our technology, Magnolia replied.If were captured wed be obligated to destroy ourselves rather than let the Scraumudi escape.It might be a better death than whatever the Scraumudi give us.Were not blowing up the damn ship!Marc ordered.He closed his eyes and placed his front two fingers on his temples.I want to create a secure area where the children, civilians and any non essential personal can seek refuge from any invaders.I think most people would feel safest in the Chapel, Helena suggested.Marc nodded.Right, anyone not needed for the immediate operations of this vessel will take sanctuary in the Chapel, he stated.Well give them as many provisions as we can fit in there, secure each and every entrance, and post armed guards both inside and out.Arachnid, how many people are in your security force?Eight, she said in a deadpan voice.Not counting myself.I doubt anyone else will be of much use in combat.We can at least use the Cornucopias to make enough orbis guns for everyone, Marc said.Theyll only fire for pre authorized individuals, Arachnid reminded him.You have the authority to deputize individuals as you see fit.You will deputize the entire crew so that we can use orbis guns.That way well at least have the ability to defend ourselves, Marc said.Sir, I am really not comfortable with letting unqualified people, especially males, use weapons, Arachnid protested.Thats an order Arachnid.End of discussion, Marc said firmly.How long would it take a Cornucopia to make an armoured ekso from scratch?A few hours, but we dont have the scratch, she replied.We dont have the facilities to create invictus or any femtotech material for the armour.You cant use any of the spare hull panels, or something?Marc asked.He knew the answer.He just felt that it should be said aloud.Arachnid shook her head.Its called invictus for a reason.Once its forged, its pretty much indestructible, she told him.Marc turned to address Randi.Randi, youve got some eksoes for the Deck Techs, dont you?he asked.Theyre not armoured though.Theyre just meant for heavy lifting, Randi explained.Would they be of any use to us in combat?Marc asked.I honestly dont have much experience with them, Randi told him.Jellybots do most of the heavy lifting.I do know that theyre not made out of invictus, so theyre not shielded against EMPs.Im sure you know that EMPs have always been the Achilles heel of eksoes.They can turn a super soldier in a suit of powered armour into a sitting duck entombed in a useless metal husk.Thats why when you see images of Necrotheists fighting Transmogs, theyre never wearing any.They used EMPs all the time.Since the Scraumudi have already attacked the ship using EMPs, Id say theyd definitely use them in a boarding party.If they do, one of my eksoes would just be a liability.Can we use holography to try to cloak people from any invaders?Marc asked.Its doubtful such an illusion would fool the Scraumudis vision, and theyd be of absolutely no use against their active scanners, Drkp replied.And hiding behind anything with a negative refractive index would leave us as blind as them.Marc nodded solemnly.Okay, what about using the Cold Plasma Shields to make the whole ship invisible.Can that be done?he asked.They werent meant for that.Its not impossible, but I doubt I could do it in the time we have, Randi replied.And that would only cloak us from light.It wouldnt do any good against tach scans, which is why ships dont usually have optical cloaks in the first place.Okay, I think we should abandon the whole becoming invisible idea, and focus on more active defence strategies, Ilene suggested.Youre right, youre right, Marc said.Theyre most likely to board us through the airlock, is that correct?I believe so sir, Drkp replied.What if they cut through the windows or the hangar doors?Ilene asked.The windows are just as strong as the rest of the hull, and once the hangar doors are sealed they wouldnt be able to force them open without risking serious damage to the ship, Drkp replied.It would be easiest for them to force their way through the airlock.So what if we vented the atmosphere in that section, or pumped a sedative into the air or something?Magnolia asked.Drkp shook his head.Theyll just hold their breath.Depending how hard they exert themselves, they can go hours without breathing, he informed her.I can think of no other environmental hazards we possess that would be effective at deterring them.We shall have to use force.Agreed.Well station the defence force primarily at the airlock and the Chapel, Marc said.As for combat between the Deity and the Scraumudi vessels, we should keep the particle cannons set to firing neutrons.They seem to be more effective at causing damage.Arachnid, I understand that our fusion torpedoes can be modified to function as neutron torpedoes, is that correct?Aye sir,  How long would it take you to modify one of our fusion torpedoes to serve as a neutron torpedo?With a couple of technicians helping me it should take more or less ten minutes.Get on it.If we can get another shot at them with their force field down well fire that at them.If youd like Captain, I could work out the yield needed to incapacitate the Scraumudi vessel for several days, while having little ill effects on the Scraumudi themselves, Drkp offered.Marc nodded at him.Please do.I dont want to hurt anyone any more than is absolutely necessary for our self defense, and I dont want to kill anyone at all, he said.Well take as much hydrogen and helium gas from this planet as we can before leaving.Well use it to increase the density of our shields.Id also like to reduce the shields diameter if thats possible.But what are we going to do about their shield?Arachnid asked.It is technically a force field.That means its not going to wear down from bombardment like ours will.If we could penetrate it, those ships would be no threat to us.What if we rammed one of them?Randi suggested.What would that accomplish?Arachnid asked.For every reaction theres an equal and opposite reaction, right?So when their force field pushes matter away, its source is pushed in the opposite direction with an equal amount of force, Randi replied.If we go at them hard enough we would tear their force field generator right out of its socket.Its a bioship, so it must be held in place with ligaments or something.It cant be that hard.No.If we hit their force field with that kind of momentum, our inertial negation system couldnt compensate fast enough.Wed all be killed, Drkp reported.What if we sent one of the shuttles on a collision course?Ilene asked.Even the wayfarers have less than one five thousandth of this vessels mass, Drkp replied.Even if we sent all of our shuttles it wouldnt do any good.What if we found, like, an asteroid and hurled it at them?Randi suggested.There arent any asteroids in this system, Drkp told him.Except for this planet, every rock bigger than a skipping stone was used to make the ring world.If it came to it, we could run them through at hyperluminal speed, Arachnid suggested tentatively.Marc gave her a shaming glare.It will not come to that, he said definitively.He let out a frustrated sigh.I think weve gone over pretty much everything.Arachnid, I want this ship prepared for combat and a possible boarding as soon as possible.Sook yin, make sure youre ready for casualties.And I want a medic in the Chapel.Blades, make sure that all non essential personnel are secured in the Chapel with ample supplies.Kamadev, plot the fastest possible course to the wormhole.Drkp, Magnolia, Randi; make sure that when we get there well be able to get out.Dismissed.Everyone solemnly left to perform their duties, leaving Marc alone in the darkened room.Except for one.What about me?Helena asked.Youre an Anthropologist.Your expertise isnt relevant in this situation, Marc stated.Youll be in the Chapel.You cant force me to, Helena claimed.Yes I can.I can confine anyone anywhere with just cause, Marc informed her.If you wont willingly take refuge in the Chapel then Ill have you confined there for insubordination.Marc, please dont do that, Helena pleaded.I dont want to be cowering down there while youre on the bridge trying to save us.If we lose this ship to the Scraumudi hiding in the Chapel isnt going to protect us for long.If I have to die, I want to die with you.Helena  Marc please let me stay with you.If the ship was boarded and you didnt know what was happening to me wouldnt that be a distraction to you?Its conceivable Marc conceded.All right.If you want to, you can stay on the bridge with me.Thank you, she said, taking hold of his hand.Any premonitions about whether well make it out of here?Marc asked.She smirked.Reply hazy, ask again later, she said.He smiled.Helena, if we do die, I want you to know that I love you as Ive loved no one else.That Ive missed you, and I didnt realize how much I missed you until I saw you again.I wish we could have spent the last thirty years together, Helena lamented.The first time we got together after I was thirty, we should have just eloped.The only reason we didnt was because despite how much I loved you, thirty just seemed far too young to get married.I thought with my head instead of my heart, and its the biggest regret of my life.Now that were finally together again, I dont want you to be taken away from me.She hugged him tightly to her, both trying their best not to cry, knowing it would only make things worse.But tears came nonetheless.***      After only a brief respite from peril, a deep tremor rocked the Deity as she cowered deep within the blue clouds of her sanctuary.Levanoch had found them.Whats going on?Marc asked as he and Helena walked onto the bridge.It was the shockwave of some kind of depth charge.It went off about eight thousand kilometres starboard, Arachnid replied.She was now clad in a powered exoskeleton with armour woven from invictus filaments and a helmet with a one hundred and eighty degree visor resting beside her.I guess theyve figured out were hiding here, but they still cant detect us.Its only a matter of time before they hit us, Ilene stated.We need to make a run for it now.Marc nodded.Whats our status?he asked  Ive issued orbis guns to roughly two hundred people and have strategically positioned them throughout the ship, as per your orders, Arachnid reported.The neutron torpedo is ready to go as well.The field coils are set to generate the necessary hyperluminal fields to invert the wormhole, Drkp stated.Pontifex Morgan reports that the Chapel is secured, Ilene said.All non essential personnel are in there, along with rations, medical supplies, weapons and other paraphernalia.Ive plotted a course back to the wormhole that brought us here sir, Kamadev reported.Awaiting your orders.Very well, Marc said, and took a seat in his chair.Sound General Quarters, go to Cold Mode, and then take us out.Battle stations were manned, weapons were charged, and the Deity was surrounded by its protective sheath of cold plasma.Kamadev started to fly up through the gas giant.Soon the blue atmosphere gave way to black space, and there hanging in the sky was the Bloodwyrm, standing out like a stain of blood on a black cloth.Theyre pursuing us, Arachnid reported.Are there any other vessels?Marc asked.No sir, Arachnid replied, somewhat confused.Its just them.I dont believe it, Ilene murmured.We might actually get away.The ship rocked as another high kinetic energy weapon bashed against their shields.Theyre using the same kind of weapon as before, Arachnid reported.But now were also being bombarded with many small projectiles.Again, another few shots and our shields will be ineffective.Well be able to go to hyperluminal before then, Kamadev said.We should still return fire, Ilene suggested.To what end?Nothing we have can penetrate their force field, Arachnid said.Wait a second; we can use the laser turrets, Marc realized.The laser turrets arent nearly as powerful as the particle cannons, Arachnid told him.Yes, but their ship is visible.That means their force field doesnt affect light!Marc explained.Arachnid nodded and targeted the Bloodwyrm.The lenses of the two aft laser turrets burned intensely with a bright red glow, and their invisible beams of focused light landed on Levanochs ship in a fraction of a second.At first they appeared to do nothing, but after a few seconds flesh began to seer and smoke.In a few seconds more the hull was breached.Atmosphere began rushing out, but no serious damage was done.The lasers only served to increase Levanochs wrath and escalate the ferocity of his assault.Were clear of the planets gravitational field!Kamadev announced.Going to hyperluminal in three, two, one!In an instant, the Deity was whisked out of Levanochs grasp.He screamed in infernal rage, demanding that his ship jump to the wormhole.Seconds later the Deity had dropped out of hyperluminal before the very wormhole that had brought them in.Take us out of Cold Mode, Marc ordered.Aye sir.Im engaging the modified hyperluminal fieldsnow, Drkp announced.It looks good.Kamadev, take us in.Aye.Everyone on the bridge held a deep breath as the Deity plunged into the wormholes dark mouth.Their hopes came plummeting down as the Deity was violently spit back out, and tumbled uncontrollably through empty space.Kumar, stabilize us!Marc ordered, and then turned to Drkp.What went wrong?II, Im not sure, Drkp stammered.Maybe, maybe if it had a higher amount of negative mass than I thought, that would have cancelled out some of the warping from the hyperluminal fields.That would have stopped the spatial curvature from reaching the critical amount needed to invert the wormhole.Magnolia, can you tell me how much negative mass is in the mouth of that wormhole?Just a second, she replied.Im getting an atomic mass of negative six per cubic meter.That is a little high, Drkp said softly.Can you fix it?Marc demanded.Yes, all I have to do is reduce the diameter of the hyperluminal fields.That will increase their intensity enough to compensate, Drkp replied.Levanochs back!
