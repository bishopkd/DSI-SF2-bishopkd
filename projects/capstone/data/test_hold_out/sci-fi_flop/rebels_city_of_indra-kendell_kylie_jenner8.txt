Then the room goes black, too.Delightful, I say.That ...was not what I intended.I find her hand in the darkness and place it on my shoulder.Just follow me.And how will that help us any more than it already has?I see in the dark, I say, already moving, so stop making that pissy face at me and get on the same page.The doors thirty six feet ahead, straight shot.Hows that possible?she asks.It just is, okay?Always been able to do it.Call it a genetic flaw if it makes you feel better.No, I wish I could do it.Sounds useful.Youre just saying that.Besides, you got your own tricks.You cant have everything.Like, howd you know that PCF was waiting for us?You read minds or something?Nothing.What, you didnt see that question coming?Livia sighs.Same as you, she says.I could always feel people.Not reading minds, exactly.I just get a sense.Intuition, really.Hardly mind reading at all.But people bleed emotions all the time, it can get really gross, and I can pick up the trail.Fourteen more feet to go.No sound except the alarms, faint, but still there.Can you feel me now?I ask her.Yes.Thats why I chose to answer your question.Because, for a very brief moment, you felt remorseful for your rudeness.Maybe, I say.But if I did, it was very brief.She stumbles, and I catch her before she falls on her face.Careful.I can feel him, too, she says.I think hes ...dying.26           Lex   I press down the synth print on the security panel.Beep.The doors whoosh open.Then the cold hits me.Ive never felt real cold.The Orphanage was temperature controlled.So was the Academy.Every day the same.Temperature control is pretty necessary for human life to continue to exist in the Lower Levels.Next to me, I can hear Livias teeth chatter  We take a few steps forward.When we turn the corner, I see a light.Livia shudders.The focused beam cuts from the ceiling down through the pitch black.At its center is a heap.I cant tell of what.I have to turn away, the force of the beam stings my eyes so bad.Thats one major drawback of them being so sensitive.I rush for the control panel, press the synth print quickly.The light disappears.Spots dance on my eyes.My entire body feels relieved.What I see next hurts more than any light ever could.The pile is a person.Their beaten, crumpled up body.Face pushed to the floor, arms covering head, defenseless, as if that would be enough to block out the light and stave off blindness.I didnt know skin could be so many shades of purple and black.I cant see the face.Still, I know.Id know him anywhere.Kane.The words just tumble out of my mouth.Dont be dead.Livia   Dead?Kane lifts his head steadily and smiles at Lex through his swollen lips, his voice hoarse.He goes to laugh, but it sounds like hes choking.Dont you know me better than that?He hasnt seen me yet, I dont think, as I stand in the shadows, watching as Lex kneels before him, finding my sudden shyness overwhelming.I remember his smile, even through the bloom of bruises.He imparted that same grin, looking up from my arms as I held him.Livia, he said, before Waslo arrived and the PCF pulled me off him.I watched as they beat him, screaming my throat raw in Waslos clutches.Ive wondered what happened to him every moment since.I feel responsible.Now the stark reality hits me.Blistered and shivering, alone in the blinding light: this is his punishment for desiring to kill me.Kane, says Lex, with a tenderness I didnt know her to possess.Took you long enough, he says.She cradles his cheek with one hand, and he recoils at her touch, no matter how tender she tries to be.Im sorry, she says.Youve gone soft, he says, his laugh causing him to wince.I feel the pain of his raw wounds and know hes hurt much worse in places we cant see.Hes very strong to have endured this much without dying already.Your chest, I say.Now he sees me.Livia ...I feel my insides leap; I cant control myself.He doesnt care for you, I remind myself.It was all part of his strategy.What the PCF did to me, he says, before another burst of pain turns his smile into a grimace, is still better than if you got your hands on me first.He jokes, but its not funny.Can you move?asks Lex.I dont know.Im not ...sure.We can carry you, okay?He shakes his head, trying to act strong, but pain is all he feels.It will take ages for him to heal.Hes damaged inside, I say.Moving him will only make it worse.This time, Lex doesnt question my feelings.Then what do we do?she asks, her voice wavering despite her carefully guarded control.I go to Kane, kneeling beside her.Lex forces herself to stand.Ill keep watch, she says, disappearing with equal swiftness.She wasnt fast enough, though, for me to miss the tears forming.Hey, Kane says.In the same instant, the room changes, and the cold gives way to a thick, humid heat.My trembling is replaced by intense perspiration; it forms in places not proper for even a former Proper Young Woman.Dont mind that, says Kane, as if it were possible.He sucks in his breath, summoning the energy not to be overwhelmed by his condition.Climate ...interrogation, he says, squeezing his eyes tight.They figure if they just keep changing the temperature, theyll break me.I think ...I might even be getting used to it.I keep silent until I feel the agony subside.We have a few moments, I think, until the next wave.Kane, I say.He looks up at me.I need to touch you.Oh yeah?he says, the grin returning, only this time a little wicked.Go right ahead.I gently lift his shirt, trying not to cringe at the sight of his injuries.He watches me, still smiling.If you wanted to see me with my clothes off, all you had to do was ask.I gently rest my hands on his rib cage.Hes not smiling anymore; it must be draining for him to keep up the good face.His imprisonment is barbaric.I dont know if theyll be enough, but I have Heps homemade boosters rattling in my palm.I open the bottle and dump a few in my hand.Too many could kill him.Not enough, and hell die anyway.Im no nurse.I have no training.Take these, I say, four of them in hand.He eyes the boosters and I put one on the back of his tongue.I coax him into dry swallowing it, and Im not sure how many more hell get down.The second one takes even longer, his throat working overtime, his stomach tightening.Suddenly, his body goes rigid, his eyes rolling back in his head.I keep hold of him so that he doesnt hurt himself further.What are you doing?screams Lex.Kanes body has now come back to life, his limbs and torso shaking.Helping him, I say.I gave him some boosters, but ...The room turns icy again, and Kanes tremor begins to subside, and as much as it pains me to see him like this, knowing even further I am the root of it, I hold steady.His pain is all I can feel; it overwhelms my mind and I imagine that I can take it on, I can take on all of his pain until it stops altogether.It is so raw and vicious I bite my lip until it bleeds.If you made him worse, Ill kill you, says Lex.I swear, Livia, Ill take you by the  Calm down, killer, says Kane.Her eyes widen as he begins to move, carefully pulling himself to lean against me.Im okay, he says.Just a case of the shakes.He looks at me, our faces close enough to be touching.You punch me in the face, he says, then ...Hes breathing heavily.Whatever I have done terrifies and intrigues him.But I must be forgetting something in between ...I dont need to sense him to know that he remembers the kiss as clearly as I do.You, Livia Cosmo, are the strangest girl I have ever met.He gives me that curling smile, his eyes glittering with life once again.No, I tell myself.You wont allow him to charm you.Not this time.Almost done?asks Lex.Almost, I say.I feel her not quite believing me, but not wanting to argue.Shes worried and distracted.Hurry, she says.I can hear them coming.Perhaps Im strange, I tell Kane, but Im also trustworthy.And if I punched you, it was only because I had good reason.His grin fades.You were sent to kill me, I say.He nods faintly.I feel Lexs eyes burning into me.Give me your injured hand, I tell him.He holds it out to me.I rest my own unblemished hand on his rough, callused palm.The hand of someone who makes things.My hand isnt injured.I know, I say sharply.But Lex is watching closely, and I need answers.Quickly.I half close my eyes.First you spied on me, from the rig.Is that correct?Yes, he says.You did this for quite a while?Much longer than was required.I couldnt help it.I could have watched you for  No, I say.I wont let him distract me.You tried to kill me, Kane.No.I didnt.I was sent to kill you, but I couldnt go through with it.I had the tablet ready.All I had to do was kiss you  And pass it along?Yes.And then  I kissed you instead, I say firmly, my eyes opening.Kane nods.I couldnt have hurt you, Livia.I couldnt hurt anyone, really.But especially not you, not with how I feel about  No.He wont escape so easily.This is not another Courting Dance.Who sent you after me?I have no idea, he says softly.I wish I knew.Id go after them myself.We stare at each other.I sense his pain and confusion.Unfortunately, hes telling the truth.I was taking orders, he says.For that reason alone, I might never forgive you.Hey!Cmon already!booms Lex, glaring at us.I drop Kanes hand.What are you guys doing?Do you want them to get us?Theyre getting closer.I hear nothing, but shes telling the truth.In that instant, I sense them nearby.They are close enough for me to feel them.There are many of them, and all are burning to punish us.Yet even more powerful than the approaching danger?Lex right next to me.Her emotion washes over me with powerful intensity.Kane belongs to her, not me.That is what she is feeling.Lex   Focus, Lex.You can deal with this later.Right now, they are coming.I try to help Kane up, but he ignores my outstretched hand.Stubborn scrubber, I say, watching him fight to his feet.Rather get us killed than have me help you.Hes standing now, and smiling.He takes a few unsteady steps, but at least he can walk.Well?he says to Livia.Will you?Let me prove it to you?I might consider the possibility, she says.Now theyre looking at each other and grinning.They already have secrets?What kind of core low stupidity is going on here?Livia hands him the blaster we swiped from the PCF craft.She pulls out the sword, which is singing like crazy.That, says Kane, looking at it, is the most strato thing I have ever seen.Footsteps bang down the hallway.Too late, says Lex.There are too many of them, says Livia.Six, at the very least.I dont ask how she knows this.At this point, why ask questions?Shes a freak, but at least a helpful one.We cannot possibly take them all, she adds.I dont like this, I say, the air boiling around us.My silitex regulates the heat, but only so much.Two PCF burst in, weapons at the ready.Livia leaps and slashes the first one before he can even comprehend what hes facing.I blast the other quickly.Ive still got it, I think.Theres no time to be proud.More will be coming.We must survive this first.I hate to be right, but I still have the cadet in me.Another PCF follows through the door, blasting.I drop to the floor and take aim.As soon as he falls, another is waiting.So is Livias blade.She cuts him two times, rating high in efficiency.Thats all it takes.In that time, a wave of four storm us and theyve got us dead, if thats what they want.I dont know.I can hope not.One has his blaster to the back of Livias head, and hes smirking.Her sword is still raised, and shes thinking about making a move.Watch it!I scream, just as the blast rings out.The PCF slumps to the floor next to her, and for a second the other goons are just as confused as I am.One of their own is blasting them from behind.Shooting each one of them in the back.The troopers blasts sizzle with ferocity.Its only when theyve opened their visor that it becomes clear why theyve done this.Vippy?Sure enough its Vippy underneath the helmet.She looks way more threatening than Id ever imagine she could be.Howd you get so big?Theres lifts in my boots.Im not sure if a hug is appropriate.Hey, Vip!Kane says.She nods at him.At central command theyre monitoring our biorhythms and will see that these three are stunned.Take my access chip, then take my blaster and stun me and go.But why would you do this?Im a rebel, she says.She would be right in assuming my confusion is also disgust.I cant help the way I feel.Always have been.A teams been dispatched to get you out of here and take you in.Evac point is by the transporter tube on this level.They can help you.Im not going with any rebels.My saying this hurts her.I almost cant imagine that what she says is true.Come with us, Kane says.I cant, Vipsinia says.A placement here is worth too much to our people.I can help them more here than anywhere else.Im not going with a bunch of rebels, I say.Livia looks at me strangely.Like Im doing something wrong.Just what do you think you are then?Kane looks like he agrees.After this, youre not going to be welcomed back with some sort of award.But a rebel?I just came to save my friend.I just ...I take Vippys offered blaster and access chip.This girl I showed a kindness to once ...only once ...and now shes repaid it more than in full.If shes a rebel, then perhaps I dont know everything there is to know.This is going to hurt, I say.Of course it  I stun her in midsentence and drop the sizzling blaster next to her body.Central command will have questions for her, probably put this entire squad on leave to suss out what exactly happened, but this will help sell the narrative that shes not to blame.Only I am.Somehow everything I touch goes to hell.27           Livia   We race toward the transporter tube in the now lit hallway.Who was that girl?I ask.A cadet who graduated with me and Kane.I like her, but we werent friends.I dont understand why she would do that for us.I dont tell Lex that I could sense how much this Vippy admired her and loved her.It would not ease her guilt to know why people do good things for her.Kane grins as he catches up to us.We got about five minutes till backup comes.And the guys back there?asks Lex.Dont worry about them.Theyll have to thaw first.Thaw?I say.Lex is already smiling, as though they speak a language all their own.He activated the climate control, she says.Theyll be frozen solid.Maybe not solid, but real icy, he says.Not that theyll be able to open the door with anything less than an arc welder.We look at each other, all three of us, and smile for just a moment.Even small victories have their rewards.Okay, I say.This is the evac point, right?This is where we meet them.But how can we trust them?Lex asks.The rebels didnt do this to us, Kane says.Lex nods.Shes confused.We all are.Even more so when a team of shock troopers rushes us from behind.PCF.We shouldve been ready for this.Around every corner theres always more PCF.Lex   Were surrounded by PCF.Five of them.I reach for my blaster, Livia her sword.Dont even think about it, says the one in front.I draw anyway.The blaster jumps from my hand.I didnt even see him move, it was that quick.I told you not to, Lex.He knows my name?Now hes really got my attention.The PCF uniform fits properly, but its a bit ragged, especially for Hickie patrol.His long barreled blaster, while it could still kill us all dead, doesnt look like its been cleaned or maintained in months.Rebels.Good to see Vipsinia came through.We wouldve been here quicker, but someone destroyed the garden, which has become a bit of a thing.He lifts his helmet, and hes younger and shaggier than the fine men of rarefied air.His troops follow his lead, and Ive never seen anything like them.One has a drawing on his cheek.Another smiles, only to reveal that his top row of teeth is all blistered metal.Long way from where youre supposed to be, Kane says.Dont appreciate us breathing your air, Islander?asks the shaggy haired one.Id rather you werent breathing any of it, I say.Him and me, weve come to an impasse.I meant what I said.I dont do overly friendly strangers.Livia retrieves my blaster for me.If these ...rebels are willing to show us the way out, she says, lets do the logical thing and follow them, for now.A kindness was paid, so now a kindness is done.Shaggy nods.Its good to see someone carries the intelligence gene.I jam my blaster hard in his guts and his men crowd me.If youre so interested in genetics, I could give you a real good look at your insides.Zavier.The rebels step back, even this unshaven Zavier, all showing deference to the man who spoke.A real man.That, I think, is the real leader.Livia   Excuse Zaviers disposition.Hes not worked on his social graces as much as his soldiering.This mans old enough to be any of the rebels father, but his manner suggests he was born in a different strata than any of them.I suspect he could hold his own in Waslos presence.He holds his wiry frame tall, hands clasped in front of him, with not a hint of aggression.He looks relieved to see us.My ladies and gentleman, I am Roscoe.He bows, as would any Proper Gentleman.He smiles and his skin crinkles at the corners of his eyes and lips.Wrinkles, I know, though I have never seen them, our science having eliminated all signs of aging long ago in Upper Indra.Yet this man wears his age well, dignified, far from deterioration, his warm eyes glowing as though witnessing something rare and extraordinary.He catches himself.You must forgive my own rudeness.It has been a very long time, Livia, he says, bowing again.Lex scoffs, showing her displeasure with his etiquette, and even her disinterest grants him a gracious chuckle.A true high born gentleman, masquerading as a scavenger.And you are Lex, of course, he says to her.He turns to Kane, his hand extended, when Lex shouts, Enough with the introductions!Roscoe drops the smile, but not his disposition.I dont care who you are right now, she continues.We gotta get out of here.And if you dont plan on shooting your way out, you can join the rest of the bodies that way.Roscoe draws his blaster.Well, of course.Were here to escort you, Lexie.Her eyes go wide and if she isnt about to punch him, then I will cohabitate with a dirty scavenger.Kane must sense the same thing because he grabs her arm.Hes trying to help us.Let him.Lex would rather die, I can tell, but Kane she listens to.What they have isnt easy to build between two people.It cant be studied or taught, only forged over the bitterness of time.Lex picks up the buzzing sound before everyone else and she looks sharply at the rebel from which it comes.He stares back at her, confused, until he hears it too and is embarrassed.He lifts an outdated handheld earfeed up and listens.He goes to tell the older man, but she already knows what hell say.The PCF have locked down our location, Lex says.We have two minutes in which to leave.Roscoe isnt surprised at her hearing.Either he is utterly unflappablequite possibleor he knows more about her than shes comfortable with him knowing.That is undoubtedly correct.Now, either of these routes you take will lead to a quick capture or fates far worse.Your only choice is to come with us, Zavier says.He does it to goad Lex.We must keep our eye on him.He wants to incite people to be as unhappy as he is.Why should we trust you?I say to Roscoe.Something crosses his face: he doesnt want to hurt us, of this Im aware.Were terribly important to him, yet Im unsure as to why.Because, he says.I was a friend to your mother, Livia.And I made her a promise long ago that I would keep you safe.And it has taken me far too long to keep my word.Im too shocked to offer a rebuttal.Words!Lex yells.Thats all he has!All you want to do is control us, just like everybody else!Hes not lying, I say, taking Lexs hand before she loses control.That she lets me ...I cannot reason why.The shell has broken.And yet, I say to him, you do not tell the full story.Our time grows short, he says.But I know that you must sense the truth I speak.Youll keep us safe, on that Im clear.Again he nods.But if at any time that should change ...Your meaning is clear.Lex and Kane wait expectantly.That Ive gained their trust is immeasurable.We have no other choice, I tell them.And you feel they dont want to hurt us?asks Lex.Yes, I say.Kane looks at us both as though were crazy and shrugs.Im glad we all agree.Lex signals our new allies.Lets get moving, rebel scum.28           Lex   Youll come with me, Zavier says.The one who disarmed me.Who could use some Academy discipline and grooming.His hair almost covers his narrowed blue eyes.If I keep him close, I can take him down if the time comes.When the time comes.The rebels become a shield around Livia and me.If its their intent to disorient us, its working.They move as we move.They look like PCF, but their disguises wont hold up to much scrutiny.The real ones cant be far behind.We stop.My human shield loosens their perimeter of protection.Im standing in front of a hole in the wall.The metal grating has been removed from this vent.The rebels each crawl inside and disappear.When its my turn, someone shoves me.Zavier.I shoot him a look.Im crawling through a tunnel, and Zaviers right on my tail, barking, Move it!He gives me another shove and I strike out with my heel, which nails the metal siding by his chin.Hes less aggressive after that, and I move even faster.When the butt of the rebel in front of me clears out, Im greeted by light and, surprisingly, what feels like fresh air.I stand up in a small alcove.In front of us is an enormous plexi clear window.Zavier guides me out of his way.He removes a small torch from his belt and its tip ignites into ultra blue flame.He scorches the panel at its seams, loosening it.It takes all of the rebels to remove it.The gusts blow violently inward, as if to warn us to keep our distance.So close to freedom, nothing can stop us.All that separates us is the vibrant dusk sky.Night has begun to fall and well use its cover to escape.I think on how this all began, in an Archive, waiting for Kane, and since then how I havent stopped moving.One by one, each rebel stands in the windowless frame.They cross their arms over their chests, Zavier whispersa blessing?then they launch backward and disappear.I watch, shocked, as they hurl themselves into the air.Whats going on?I ask Zavier, but he ignores me.Livias next.Shes facing me, back to the window.A rebel stands behind her, his arms around the waist of her once white dress, now brutally torn.A large, dirty swath of it blows in the wind and she rips it off and lets it float away.If only all of us could travel so lightly.I wouldnt admit it, but she looks so strato this way.I should offer her words of comfort, but Im not any good at that.Plus Im ...uneasy myself.She drops like a stone.Hurry, says Zavier in my ear.Im on the edge of the frame, of a building, my feet leaden.I stare out and watch the others become dwarfed by the vast expanse of Indra below.Im as high as the clouds themselves.Im very conflicted on this whole thing.No time for sightseeing, says Zavier.Hes all up in my face, doesnt even have the decency to do this like the others.He wants to humiliate me.My silitex body armor cant redistribute my sweat fast enough.He wraps his arms around me, holds me tight enough to hurt.Face to shaggy face.My legs are shaking.I thought, he says in my ear, you were supposed to be the brave one.I can be.I want to be.But not now.Livia   The instant before we fall, as I stand in the windowless frame, Lex catches my eyes.She stares at me, confused, not sure what to believe, and I share her feelings.If only we had stopped to talk much earlier, this mess were in would not be.We mightve changed it all for the better.Dont worry now, Livia.We got the parazips to hold us.My rebel protector refers, I assume, to the thin cord from which were dangling.The man harnessed behind me releases the round cap from a canister attached to his belt and suctions it to the side of the window frame.He tells me hundreds of feet of microcord are compressed into every canister.These cords could suspend an air speeder from an island without failing.Then Im flying backward with zero resistance, unencumbered.Ive wondered for so long what this would feel like and its ...Exhilarating.They call me Jefferson, says the rebel loudly, rather cheerfully, I believe, especially considering that were rapidly accelerating toward an uncertain, yet highly feasibly untimely, ending.The line grows longer and longer above us.One thin line from a canister that, if Im to believe this man, will continue to hold us aloft as were falling.Just relax and enjoy the fall, he says.Im starting to, I really am, when we swing back in toward the Council building.Jefferson bends his knees, makes contact, and launches us into air once again.Sideways we swing, and rapidly we fall.I swivel my head, hoping to glimpse Kane beneath me, when Jefferson puts his hand on my cheek and gently guides my face toward the sky.Dont look down.Thats the key.I dont spot Kane, but I think I see Lex above.I cant imagine shes enjoying this as much as I am.Every few stories, Jefferson halts us, steadying his feet on the side of the building.Hes growing tired.For a moment, we rest in midair.He holds the line and takes a deep breath.Replacement time, he says.May I?I pull a fresh canister from his belt.Hes pleasantly surprised by my initiative.Like this?I say.Exactly.Ive been watching him every drop of the way.I flick the switch and a brand new string releases and suctions to the surface of the plexi clear.I pull, checking the grip, then wrap the cord like I observed him doing and attach the canister to his belt.His arms bring me in close once again.I give him a thumbs up.Ready when you are, Jefferson.Lex   How many of those ...are there?I ask.Just enough, Zavier says.Youre not going anywhere.The rush the parazip creates shocks my system.With a speeder or stolen craft, at least Im in control.Running from the PCF and now allied with rebels?Ive relented all feeling of it, for now.I have to.Im harnessed to someone I already despise, rappelling off Indras highest building into the unknown.Hes right in my face the whole time.And this guyZavierputs Cassina to shame.What makes you so special, huh?he says.Thats what I want to know.Youre not so bad looking, dont get me wrong.Might even find us a place to ourselves and see how that goes.If I didnt know about your rep.If I didnt know the truth.He lands, feet to the building.Crouches.Pushes off.We soar downward.Hardcase cadet.You like all those rules and regulations.Bet you can follow orders, cant you?Without question.Kill without remorse.Bet youd let me boss you around.Just try it, I say, my breath halting from the sheer drop.Ill kill you, without remorse.Dangling in space by a thread.He could just drop me, after all.Tell the others it was a horrible accident.Instead, I bite my tongue.Later, I tell myself.Ill take care of him when my feet are back under me.Land.Crouch.Push off.Soar downward.I said no when they asked, he continues.He wont ever stop.Rescue that girl?Not even for all the air in the sky.Land.But Roscoe, he knows more than me.And much more than you.Crouch.Shes the one who will save us.Push off.Huh.You cant even save yourself.Soar downward.At some point, we break so suddenly my stomach is still dropping.We hover in midair, rocking back and forth.I can feel his breath on my neck.His body hard and tense with anger.Were immersed in the spires of Indra.A man made canyon that can even silence this angry rebel.The citys blood, whether we like it or not, beats within all our chests.What now?I wonder.Did he use the last canister already?Were nowhere near the ground.In case you dont understand, he says finally, youre nothing special.We dont need you, no matter what anyone says.I fight the urge to kick him.To choke him until he loses consciousness.Right there, hanging in space.Hes made this personal.His hate of me runs as deeply as mine for him.What now?I ask.Now?he says.He gives a low, mean laugh.We go back where you should feel right at home.Give you your crown.The vibrations bounce off the plexi clear and I see their shimmering reflections glinting right back at us.Four air speeders whip around the corner, coming straight for us.Where are you taking me?What do you cadets call it?He snorts.Oh yeah.Rock Bottom.29           Livia   When I used to stand at the edge of Helix and look down at the City of Indra, Id imagine myself visiting one day.I could see myself walking the corridors with Middlers, doing the things that they did in their everyday life.I would be just another Indrithian citizen, I imagined wistfully, not anyone of Importance.Truth be told, I had no concept of what everyday life entailed.Still do not, in all sincerity.But that was not part of the fantasy.In my imagination, I was no one special, just another body blending into the fabric of Indrithian Society.I should have known.This is my first time in the city, and the last thing I do is fade into the background.This is unlike anything I could have ever imagined.Im on the back of a speeder, my arms wrapped around a disheveled man named Chae.At least, I suppose thats his name, for it was the only word he uttered when he met us in midair.I have never met someone with hair on their face.Veda does not count.My name is Livia, I told him, elated to be on something solid.The man responded by grunting.Hold tight, Jefferson said from the speeder next to me, shouting so as to be heard over the roaring engines.Dont want to go flying right off the back.The instant Chae took off, though, I knew that could be a problem, and we race through the sky at ferocious velocity, down toward Indras gleaming streets.I clutch him as though he is the thread of a forgotten memory that Im desperate to grasp.Were surrounded by speeders on all sides, Jefferson remaining at our left flank with his arms around a long haired rebel.A woman, perhaps, though it could well be a man.These rebels have rather unique appearances.I see another formation of speeders in the distance.Perhaps Lex is among them, I think, or Kane.Nearing the ground, broad boulevards emerge from the airscraper created canyons.Almost there, I think, believing solid earth has never seemed lovelier.The only question: Where exactly are we going?Jefferson breaks into a wide, cheerful grin at my side.He yells something I cannot hear, to which I raise my eyebrows quizzically.He says it again, mouth moving slowly enough to read his lips.He smiles again and this is my last look at him before he goes flying backward, arms and legs splayed at unnatural angles.Blaster fire ionizes the air.Within moments Jefferson will hit the ground, which suddenly seems far from lovely.He will die instantly, if hes not already dead.Of this I am sure.His last words were to me:  Enjoy the ride.Lex   Man down, Zavier says as he steers the speeder through Indras canyons.Left side enforcement to Cosmo A.  Nelson, take up position.Were on Popper radar now, so take the backup route.Rendezvous Drill Facil, same as before.He accelerates into the turn, and then were plummeting with the same controlled precision Im known for.His men follow the best they can.Be careful, he yells.He jerks his chin and the whole pack swerves.His hands choking the accelerator and his piloting is borderline reckless.I fight the urge to commandeer this speeder.We touch down in some miserable back alley, some stretch where no one walks because it looks like the Lower Levels are seeping into this one.We hover there, his team awaiting his signal.Livia?I say.Is she  Cosmo A is fine.Kane?You dont need to worry about him neither.He gives the go sign.The only casualty, he says, was one of our own.We take off.At the Academy, youre taught that the citys laid out in a perfect grid with regulated block sizes.There are public recreational spaces at every ten intervals.To promote communal gatherings.The thought being that if you see and communicate with your neighbors, youre less likely to harm one another.But this has never encouraged a feeling of community, since it is felt that it is just another way the IHC can better observe and control your interactions.I bet the good citizens of Indra also dont think about the people living right beneath them, or the feelings that fester there.Zavier and his men bend tight corners and passages so narrow I can reach out and touch the sides.We careen through a waste dump.Everywhere we go is fit for only Middlers and Hubbers, and they keep their heads down when they hear us coming.We go so fast I have to clutch this man I despise.I make sure to dig my fingernails into him.The light of the blasts travels faster than their sound.The energy is ricocheting off plexi steel before it all sounds too close for comfort.I spare a glance behind, and this patrol threatens to overtake us.Damn Poppers, Zavier hisses.Poppers, PCFwhatever you call themyou could illuminate the entire city with the amount of blasting theyre doing.Zaviers doing his best to outrun them, but PCF speeders are far superior.He sets a course for a rigger storage yard to our immediate left.Unorganized and filthy, just what youd expect from a rigger, but that means space to lie low and duck out of sight.Too bad someone else thought of it first.Those well maintained, clean burning PCF engines sound real hungry to me.Zavier lifts his hand, ready to signal our descent.Wait!I shout.Not that way.Theyre already there.I can hear them.He refuses to acknowledge me.His hand drops and so do we.Were down in the abandoned heap and I cant get Heps voice out of my head.We live for a while, and then we die.Cant stop either when the time comes.Hes wrong.I was born to no one, so no one has claim over my life.And if I dont do anything now, this jackass will get us all killed.Lying in wait, the PCF grind their teeth.They power up their blasters.Still, theyre not quick enough for me.I start blasting as soon as we round the corner.My shots dont hit anyone, but they distract the PCF long enough for the rebels to draw down.Ive evened the odds, but I still wouldnt call it a fair fight.Every rebel casualty will be pinned on my head, so no one else is dying just yet.Weve only just begun striking back.Zavier steers with one hand, shoots with the other.He curses.Id curse too if I were that bad a shot.PCF fire hits the speeder on our left flank.A rebel falls off the back.The driver swerves, his arm smoking and enflamed by blaster splash.Still alert, but hes fading quick.Zavier yells at the driver.Robertson!Bring me in, I tell Zavier, my feet now on the seat under me.Dont you dare!he yells back.I can do this on my own.He grabs at me, but no one can stop me if I dont want them to.I land hard on the seat, straddling the speeder behind the driver.Hes completely slumped over by now and the speeder veers wide right.I reach over his body and grab the controls, correcting our course to get out of this dump.I take his earfeed out and place it in my ear.Zaviers curses hide his wounded pride.Maybe hes not the leader he thought he was, but I just saved someones life he shouldve been looking out for.If youre really here to protect us, I say to everyone listening, try to keep up.The drill facil location pings red on my nav board.I plot the most direct course.This time, everyone follows my lead.30           Livia   Were waiting at the meet up location when the dust billows our way.The PCF hunted us and we owe our freedomand livesto Chaes quick thinking.One of the rebels asks how much longer we have to wait.Were all in this together now, Chae says.No one asks again.I sit by Kane and we dont talk.I imagine hes thinking about Lex, too.I feel him watching me, and the heat coming off his body is a strange comfort to me.The three of us, our lives are intertwined now.All my life Ive looked for something more than island life and I feel as if Im on the verge of ...something.Maybe a nervous breakdown.Maybe Ill soon be recovering alongside Governess on Sunrise Retreat Island.The dust cloud expands and my eyes sting.I tear away another piece of my dress to cover my mouth before I choke.At its heart I can hear firing engines.Wild riders blaze out of the cloud with Lex at the lead.Im relieved, yet far from surprised.The first rebel we met, the shaggy haired Zavier, leaps off his speeder as soon as its touched down.No need to sense his feelings, since he does little to hide his overwhelming fury.It rivals Lexs at her peak.His bright blue eyes shine ice cold, and hes handsome, even like this, in a way island boys could never be, their natural appeal blunted by endless sculpting procedures.Of course, theyre not prone to murder, either.The focus of his indignation doesnt surprise me.Lex dismounts her speeder, regaining a level of militaristic swagger and ...calm?How unlikely.Who do you think you are?Zavier bumps right into her.Hes a real savage, that one.And her?Placid as a reflecting pool.She refuses to engage with this bully.You disobeyed my orders, you spoiled little  I think everything worked out remarkably well.Just because you went to the godforsaken Academy, you can  She grabs Zaviers face with one hand and squeezes his mouth shut.He knocks it away.Dont you dare take your anger out on me, she says.Chae inserts himself between them and brushes Zavier back.Lay off her, Z.   Kane joins Lexs side, but knows not to step up, that shes quite capable of fighting her own battles.If anything, Chaes interference makes Zavier more furious, and he has no regard for his new target.Are you taking her side?he yells.No sides, Z.  Just us.Robertson  Got done in by Poppers.But if she  didnt save Luthers life?What?Whats your point?One for one?Are you really trying to argue acceptable losses?You already forget what she did to Emil?!I dont know any Emil, Lex says.Zavier whips around, ready to tear her apart, and instinctively I reach for my zinger, ready to intervene.Of course you dont, Zavier says.Youre just like the rest of them, arent you?Score another kill for your holofile, drop another rock on the pile.Enough, Roscoe says, not loudly, yet forcefully enough to bring the argument to a standstill.Remember what we set out to accomplish.We have lost many, but today we have also gained three.Leave your anger for the enemy and be gracious in victory.Indra wasnt erected overnight, and we cannot hope that our dreams, fueled by our blood, will materialize quickly either.His words have turned half the rebels eyes on me.The other half are on Lex.Even Zaviers.He swallows his anger, though it isnt far from the surface.But he seems to believe in something much greater than himself, at least some of the time.I cannot fathom their beliefs, or how we could possibly tie into them.There is much to learn.Its frightening to mean this much to others.Lex nods knowingly at me; we will go along with this.I nod back.Kane smiles, game for adventure.Now, says Roscoe, when they seem to be settling down.There is still more work to be done.So let us bid farewell to the once and future great City of Indra.The rebels get to work removing the grate from an enormous drainage pipe.Its already loose, but takes the strength of four to move.Chae throws a towline down the pipe and secures it to the heavy grate.One by one, the rebels descend, then followed by Kane.Zavier goes last, mounting the pipe slowly.Before he drops, Roscoe puts a hand on his shoulder and Zavier looks up hopefully.Hes tired.We all are.Roscoe smiles.We will speak, soon.Zavier sighs, his shoulders slumping in relief.He drops, not seeking further affirmation from the three of us.I know you have questions, Roscoe says to us, and all will be answered.On this you have my word.But for now, let us take sanctuary.No, I say.You have the bearing of a Proper Indrithian, so it would be uncustomary to not engage us in conversation when requested, would it not?You are correct.Then tell us who you are.I sense his hesitation; this isnt easy for him, and yet, he desperately wants us to trust him like the rebels do.The more appropriate question is not of my identity, but your own, he says.You told me that you knew my mother, I say.That she was your friend.I have never met one who would match that claim.I did not think they existed any longer.They do, as long as I live and breathe.He looks to Lex.I knew your mother as well.I do not have a mother, she says, surprising me.You do.In facthe looks from Lex to me and back againyou share the same one.In fact, that is not all you share.Since the discovery of our symbols earlier, it is hard to look at her without seeing it.The flaw in each of our eyes, that shouldnt exist, but somehow does.How we mirror each other, not in exact appearance or attitude, but in our resolves.For almost eighteen years we have fought through life, only to be rewarded with the promise of more fighting to come.You share your birthday, he says.Twins.Excerpted from The Book of Indra, Appendix IV: Laws of Indra: The Population Control Acts      The Law of Twins   As ordered by the Independent High Council of the City of Indra, it is hereby Law:  1.Women are prohibited from giving birth to more than one child.2.Women are required to take the government issued EX2 pill to prevent the conception of Twins.3.Failure to comply in said Law will result in immediate banishment of both parental Cohabitants, as well as prompt seizure of Offspring.4.Following seizure, the Independent High Council will determine the Twin they deem of Greater Use to Society.5.The Twin not deemed such will be forfeited immediately to government holding for further tests.31           Lex   I look at this uppity girl across from me.She wears gowns and says perhaps.She has a singing sword and her own island and a creature that shouldnt exist.We are nothing alike.She acts like shes different.From everyone else around her.Like somehow she is special.Okay, maybe a little alike.She doesnt say a word.Stares like she knows more than me.Like she sees through me.I hate her for that.I want to punch her for even existing.I dont have a chance.Her arms are around me.And I dont push her off.It feels good to not be alone for once.Livia   I hadnt planned on putting my arms around Lex, and yet there they are.Shes turned her face away from me, yet she keeps my embrace.I dont know what shes thinking, but the sleeve of my dress is wet with her tears.I feel her fury: shed rather not be standing with her arms around me.And yet, she doesnt wish to let go either.Im crying as well, I tell her.Im crying with you.Maybe thats something twins do, I dont know.I pat her back, like Governess would.We will work out what this means together.Of this I am sure.She pulls back suddenly, her face streaked in tears.What is twins?she asks.Lex   At this point Roscoe gives us our space and stands lookout.He has nothing left to facilitate between us now, but he cant let us leave his sight.Livia tells me that one of us should have died.And yet, here we are.They would just pick one?To kill?Yes, says Livia.Though the law is rarely spoken about.It is rather old fashioned.The EX2 controls the conception of twins, after all.Not always, obviously, I say.And if anyone knew of us, one would die?Livia nods.Though we have done so much wrong, Im not certain they would spare either of us now.Now Im pacing.It doesnt make sense.This is crazy, beyond insane.How do they pick?I ask.I dont know.Why focus on things that havent happened?Our parents refused to make that choice.Thats when I realize shes wrong.Totally, completely wrong.They picked me to get rid of.Yes, Im still alive, but I didnt get to live on some island like her, to be coddled by a governess, kitchen staff, and garden crew.I most certainly wouldnt have lived there all my life and allowed myself to be so skinny.I went to a place where you slept on cots and prayed you werent the next one to go missing.I was the twin they killed.I was sent to an Orphanage, I tell her.Did you know that?I didnt even know you existed until today.An Orphanage.You understand?Fighting just to eat.I had one uniform.One tiny bed.I was a number, do you get that?Somehow, I survived.Convinced them I was worthy.Without an Etiquette Tutor or Master ...You know nothing, she says.Only anger.We are worlds apart, once again.This is why the Upper and Lower Levels will never coexist.They shouldve picked you!I say, pushing her against the alley wall.Im screaming into her spoiled little face.You got everything!You had an island and people to do every last thing you said and I was just ...242!I pull back my fist.Livia   I force Lex off of me, and now shes fighting to be free of me.Yet at this moment, Im stronger than her, strong enough that she doesnt have the luxury of ignoring me.No one else understands you, Lex, is that to be the correct assumption?I ask, mimicking her rage too well.No one else has ever had to suffer, it seems.You were given a number, and for that I apologize.Yet you were trained to do something that matters ...and I was told to be quiet and look pretty.I was cinched up and spun on a pedestal until I was regarded as having no flaws.So you see, Lex?You are half right.I did have everything ...and absolutely nothing.And everything I had, she spits right back, meant absolutely nothing.Even Kane?I let go and back away, yet she doesnt move.
