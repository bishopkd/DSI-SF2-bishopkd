Marc followed, and upon reaching the floor he bounded out into the crawlspace.Marc, over here!Ilene shouted.I got the hatch open!She had forced open the hatch to the corridor.Marc cautiously stuck out his head and held out his scanner to check for wakeful Scraumudi.He saw none.Come on, we dont have much time, he said.With a nod, Ilene jumped out of the hatch, with Marc right behind her.Which way do we go?Ilene asked.Follow me!Marc instructed, and went running down the hall.Ilene, having the longer shanks, was quickly able to catch up, and could easily have surpassed him, but instead she stayed a few paces behind.They passed several Scraumudi lying on the ground, and never saw any more movement than a twitch out of them.Ilene even leapt over one, laughing at it mockingly.Within minutes they had reached the airlock, and saw Helena waiting for them.Her face lit up at the sight of Marc.Rising to her feet, she gestured and called for them to hurry.Now Ilene moved ahead of Marc, but just as she was at the door it began to close.She leapt into the airlock only an instant before it snapped shut, leaving Marc trapped on the other side.No!Helena screamed.She started pounding on the door trying to open it, and she could hear and feel Marc doing the same thing on the other side.What the hell happened?she exclaimed.I dont know, Ilene stated.Move out of the way, Ill blast the door open.She aimed her rifle and pressed the trigger, but nothing happened.She pressed again and again, but it wouldnt fire.When the brain was destroyed all the rifles automatically returned to their default safety setting, but Ilene didnt know this.What the hell!It isnt working!she cursed.Then get up there and find something to open it with!Helena demanded.Ilene ran up to the vestibule and starting rummaging through it to find anything that would be of help.Helena remained, calling out to Marc.Her voice was very muffled, but Marc could still faintly hear it.Blades!Helena!What happened?he shouted.He felt a cold shiver run down his spine, and he knew that Levanoch was there.He spun around and saw him slithering towards him.He wasnt able to hold himself fully erect.He was hunched, and looked dishevelled.And he was staggering, wobbling to and fro, as if his many small legs were not working in concert with each other.He had to hold out his arms to keep from crashing into the walls.There was a mad gleam in his eyes, a look of absolute vengeance that had consumed all of his cognitive faculties.He no longer appeared Sapient, but rather like some wild predator honing in on his kill.You cant escape, he said hoarsely, drawing nearer and nearer to Marc.You broke free of your cell, snuck through my ship unheeded, and have thrown its central nervous system into chaos.Youve humiliated me and all my kind, but you will get no further.You will not escape.You will pay with your life for the insult youve given me, but not before Ive destroyed your mind with cruel arts of agony and torture.Your ship shall not break free of mine, and your crew will suffer the same fate as you.And when at last I am free of this Abyss I vow to you, I will personally oversee the utter eradication of all your sordid breed.As he drew closer, Marc leapt for one of the dead rifles Drkp had left behind.Since he had already inferred Ilenes rifle didnt work (otherwise she would have used it), he assumed this one wouldnt either.Without even trying to fire, he swung it like a club, striking Levanoch across the head.Levanoch growled with contempt, and with a powerful swing of his left arm knocked the rifle far from Marcs grasp.As Marc leapt towards the gun, Levanoch rammed him with his head, and he went flying into the wall.Even in his languid state, Levanochs strength was awesome.The impact utterly winded Marc, and he could only lie there gasping.Levanoch grabbed him by his changshan, bunching up the fabric enough to expose part of his abdomen.He held him up as high as he could, pressing him against the wall.With great loathing, he plunged his talons into Marcs stomach with such force that it pierced his resilient skin.Marc cried out in alarm as Levanoch pulled his blood drenched claws from his body.He futilely tried to kick him.Yes.Squirm, Levanoch taunted him, before tossing him to the other side of the room like a limp doll.Marc tried to rise under his own power, but failed.It really didnt have to be this way.We could have been allies.We could have been friends.Instead you have elected to be my enemy.I pity you, for I dont think you truly understood what it means to be my enemy.Now, I must teach you.Helena could hear Levanoch speaking, but could not understand him.The thought of her beloved in there alone with him terrified her.She had heard Marc scream, and she had heard him being thrown around, and she feared for his life.With tearful eyes and frequent cries of despair, she frantically assaulted the door, trying to open it.Out of the way, out of the way!Ilene shouted as she came running back down the airlock, holding a welding torch in her hand.A long blue flame issued forth from the nozzle, and Ilene held it up to the very top of the door.She dragged it down along the seam as quickly as she could.She was then able to push the two halves apart with a single shove.To her astonishment, Levanoch came lunging at her.She immediately held up the torch, burning his face.He shrieked in agony, madly swatting at his head to put out the flames.He went careening back down the corridor, presumably looking for a Chrysalis.Ilene and Helena rushed to Marcs side.Oh my God, oh my God.Marc youre bleeding, Helena whimpered, though the wounds had in fact already clotted.Yeah, saying that isnt going to stop it!Ilene scolded.They lifted him to his feet, and with Helena holding him up they led him through the airlock.Once they were out of the vestibule Ilene engaged an airtight lockdown of the room, since the airlock doors were gone.She slammed the com panel nearest to her.Were all back, get us the hell out of here!she ordered.Just as Drkp had said, the pink goo that had been clogging the thrusters and weapons had dissolved.With all the particle cannons pointing downwards, the Deity started blasting the hangar door to pieces.Within seconds, it was gone.With all the thrusters pointing up, the Deity shot straight down, the tentacles holding her snapping like gossamer filaments.She was free.Ive got to get Marc to sickbay, Helena said.Blades, youre in command, Marc managed to mutter.Hush love, dont talk, Helena said.She led him to sickbay as fast as he was able to walk.Ilene ran for the closest elevator and rapidly punched the button for deck one.As soon as the door opened, she bolted down the hallway to the bridge.She stopped short when she saw a Scraumudi heading her way.Fortunately though, he didnt seem to be taking any notice of her.His hands were clamped against his skull, stumbling about uncontrollably.Ilene realized that Drkp must have had the ultrasonic siren blaring throughout the ship.With a smile she dodged passed him, and continued down the hall.When she stepped onto the bridge, she saw the beautiful blackness of open space all around her.Were out, she said in disbelief.Just in time too.The Scraumudi have already recovered enough to pursue us, Arachnid replied.They havent fired anything yet though, but it wont be long before that changes.Then why dont we jump to the nearest wormhole and get out of here?Ilene demanded.Because we havent found one yet, Kamadev told her.I was too preoccupied to look for one earlier, Drkp explained, who was sitting at the observation console.Im trying to find one now.Wheres Captain Spencer?Arachnid asked.In sickbay.Im in command, Ilene informed her.Drkp, hows it coming?Ive got one.Bearing 143.95 by 92.38, distance 14 point 3 9 5 0 2 6 million kilometres.Do you see it Kamadev?Aye, plotting a course, Kamadev replied.Levanochs ship just vanished!Arachnid shouted.Wait, I got a new sensor contact.Yeah, its him.Hes jumped to the wormhole Drkp found.Ill look for another one, Drkp said.Belay that!Ilene ordered.There isnt time.All of this commotion is sure to attract attention from the trillions of other Scraumudi in here.We have to get out of here now.Is that course plotted yet Kumar?Aye maam,  Then lay it in, she commanded.But Levanochs blocking our path!Drkp exclaimed.Hes still in rough shape, we can get passed him, Ilene claimed.Just stand by to invert the wormhole on my word, and you better hope it fucking works this time!Kumar!Aye maam!Going to hyperluminal in three, two, one!As before, the Deity was spirited across millions of kilometres of space in a matter of seconds by a bubble of moving space time of her own creation.When she dropped back down to sub light speed, the wormhole was several hundred kilometres away.Levanoch was jealously guarding its entrance.Hes right on top of it, and its not much bigger than his ship is.We cant go around him, Arachnid replied.His shields are up to.We cant fire at him, unless you want to use the laser turrets again.But I dont think that would do much good.Should we go Cold?Negative, Ilene replied, sitting herself in the Captains chair.Kumar, take us straight towards him, full thrust.What?he asked dismayed.Were going to ram him, like Randi suggested, Ilene replied.Did you miss the part when I explained we wouldnt survive that?Drkp demanded.Wed both be destroyed, I know.They dont want that anymore more than we do, Ilene replied.So what youre saying is were playing chicken with them?Arachnid asked incredulously.Ilene nodded.Kumar, full thrust ahead, she ordered.Kamadev shook his head in disapproval.I do not see this ending well, he muttered.The Deity began accelerating towards the Bloodwyrm.Drkp, are the field coils set properly this time?she asked.Yes, Ill activate them the instant we enter the wormhole, he replied.Levanoch isnt moving, Arachnid reported.He still has time, dont worry, Ilene said.Were moving at forty kilometres a second and accelerating, Kamadev reminded them.I estimate well be at nearly a hundred kilometres a second when we hit him.Thats a hell of a lot of momentum.Luckily I dont know a lot about physics, so Im not too worried, Ilene said.Keep steady.Maam, he isnt moving!Kamadev shouted.He will, dont worry, Ilene claimed.Levanochs leviathan of a vessel hung motionless in space, apparently unheeding the Deitys kamikaze attack.The Deity picked up speed, and the Bloodwyrm drew nearer.The collision seemed unavoidable, but when the Deity was only seconds away, the Bloodwyrm fired a single upward thrust, pushing it just out of the Deitys path.Ilene gasped with relief and pulled her hand down over her face.Drkp immediately activate the hyperluminal fields.The boundary of the wormhole began to churn and quiver, and with one great and terrifying lurch its exit was inverted, turning into an entrance.This generated a shockwave that sped down the length of the wormhole, inverting its spatial curvature and transforming its other terminus into an exit.Ilene stared at the holographic dome in bewilderment.It worked, she murmured in astonishment.Drkp you did it!You turned a wormhole inside out.Thats fucking awesome!Thats just, fucking, wow!Commander, Levanoch followed us in.Hes right behind us, Arachnid reported.What?No!We escaped, were out.Its over!We dont have to deal with him anymore, Ilene whined.Tell him that!Arachnid said.She looked down at the readings she was getting.Wait a minute.Oh, this is perfect.What is?Ilene asked.Their shields are down.I assume it has something to do with the wormhole, or maybe whatever you did to them.Theyre helpless, Arachnid informed her.We should take advantage of this and neutralize them with the neutron torpedo.Fire away, Ilene consented.The torpedo couldnt be launched at Levanochs ship since nothing could travel backwards through the wormhole.It was merely released and the Bloodwyrm helplessly crashed into it.The explosion was visually unimpressive and did little physical damage, but the impact seemed to render the entire ship lifeless.It failed to keep up with the Deity and started wobbling on its axis.Ilene opened her mouth to ask for a report, but before she could get a word out a tremor passed through the Deity.What was that?Are they returning fire?she asked.No, its the wormhole, Drkp explained.Itsbifurcating.What?Ilene asked in bemusement.Its splitting in two, Drkp replied softly, staring at his console in amazement.Do wormholes do that?Arachnid asked.This one does, apparently, Drkp replied.A secondary wormhole had diverged from the main tunnel.While the Deity kept straight and true, the Bloodwyrm drifted down the divergent path, out of their sight.What happened to them?Ilene asked.Where did they go?I dont know, Drkp replied candidly.Did they go back into the Abyss?Arachnid asked.I doubt it.The wormhole is still outgoing.I would assume that they would exit somewhere in the dust cloud, just as we should, Drkp said.Did they cause the wormhole to split in two like that?Arachnid asked.I doubt that as well.The neutron torpedo severely damaged their systems.It will take days for the damage to be repaired, he told her.Although I should like to refrain from making assumptions, I would guess that my inverting the wormhole was somehow correlated to its bifurcation, as both events were totally unprecedented.Were coming back into normal space now, Kumar announced.The Deity shot out of the wormhole and back into the vast and magnificent Universe, but something was wrong.The stars around them were much too bright, and there was a sprawling mauve nebula very near to them.They couldnt possibly be in the dust cloud.Ilene squinted in confusion at what she was seeing.Where are we?Are we in the Milky Way?she asked.I dont think so.I dont recognize that nebula, Arachnid said.Neither does the computer, Drkp stated.Its not in our database.How is that possible?Ilene asked.Kumar, I need to know where we are.Im working on it, he said.After a moment of silence, he muttered Oh shit.What is it?Ilene asked.I have a general fix on our location.Youre not going to like it, he claimed.If Im right, were in a spiral galaxy somewhere in the Bootes Supercluster, over nine hundred million light years from the Milky Way.The Bootes Supercluster?Ilene said incredulously.Thats nearly ten times further away from home than any Human has ever been.Arachnid said.We dont even have any probes out this far.It would take years to get back home, Ilene said softly.What about the Bootes void?Arachnid asked.Its two hundred and fifty million lightyears across.It will be too barren for us to refuel, and our tanks cant even hold enough catalyzer to get us out of the Virgo Supercluster.Plus there are the Hordes of Insmyth that hunt on the fringes of the Virgo Supercluster, and God knows whatever nightmarish horrors lie between here and there.Were stuck here.Arachnid is right.We mustnt enter the Great Void, Drkp warned.Dark as it is, it is not empty.We cannot pass through it.Ilene shook her head sadly.So were lost in space?How clich, she commented.Oh were doomed, doomed!she added caustically.Everythings clich in outer space.Its best just to embrace it, Drkp suggested.She merely sighed.Drkp, how did you manage this?she asked.I honestly dont know, he told her.As I said earlier, what I did was totally unprecedented.I couldnt have predicted this would happen.Yeah, well Im the one whos going to get flak for this Drkp, she claimed.Theyre not going to blame you because youre you, and you got us out of the Abyss.But some one still has to be blamed for us being in the goddamn Bootes Supercluster, and because Im the second in command, and the acting captain at the time, its going to be me!It figures.Im in command for five minutes and I end up getting us all hopelessly stranded.I wouldnt say that its hopeless Commander, Drkp interjected.My people have vessels capable of reaching us and taking us back to the Milky Way relatively quickly.But we cant hail them.Our quantum transceiver doesnt have that kind of range, Ilene told him.I believe that I can design a device that may allow me to contact my people, Drkp claimed.But first we must locate Levanoch.I cant find him or the other wormhole anywhere on my tach scan, Arachnid replied.That thing has a five thousand lightyear range, Ilene said.And theyre not in it, Arachnid said grimly.Then well have to plot a search grid; comb this entire galaxy, Drkp said.How do you even know they ended up anywhere near us?Arachnid demanded.They could literally be anywhere in the Universe.Thats a possibility, but I believe its likely that they came out in this galaxy just as we did, Drkp told her.What about the wormhole we just came through?Ilene asked.Drkp took some readings from his console.Its already collapsing, he replied.We wont have to worry about any more Scraumudi escaping their Abyss.Well we still have God knows how many Scraumudi loose on the ship.I have to go and deal with that, Arachnid said wearily before leaving the bridge.As for myself, I would like to go to sickbay to see if anything can be done for these oozing wounds on the side of my head, Drkp said.If I may have your leave, Commander?Ilene nodded.Yeah, go ahead, she replied.She sighed and buried her face in the palm of her hand.One billion freaking light years off course.Were never taking directions from him again.
