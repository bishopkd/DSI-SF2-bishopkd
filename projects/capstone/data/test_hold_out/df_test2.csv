0,0," Manolo, Jess called out, dont worry about the pool house today.  The two oclock sun cast a glare off the smooth pool surface that made it hard to see Manolo over by the pool house.  Yes, maam, Manolo replied.  He turned back from the accessory building, picked up his equipment, and proceeded to vacuum the pool bottom.  Nearer to where Jess lay, she could see him better.  Uck, Jess thought, I am NOT a maam! Jess pulled at the gauzy wrap that covered her from the waist down.  The wrap made her feel overheated on this gorgeous sunny day, but there was no way Jess was going out in the yard without a wrap on.  Maam! Clearly, she needed it.  Wasnt it was bad enough being a thirty-eight-year-old woman with a boatload of body issues without the pool boy calling her maam? Jess sipped at her Virgin Bloody Mary and tried not to be obvious while watching Manolo work.  He wore a cropped tee with the sleeves cut off.  The shirt was dirty, stained with sweat and soil.  Filthy, slimy, and grimyJess found it sexy as hell.  Manolos long days spent in the summer sun, plus his naturally dark skin, gave him the bronze radiance of a Latin god.  His short black hair was a blessing there was nothing to block the view of his pronounced cheekbones and chocolaty eyeballs.  Manolo had the eyes of a basset hound deep and soulful.   Add in the gym shorts and sandals and ooh lah lah Jess wished the pool needed vacuuming more often.  Come on.  Look over here.  Notice me.  Nothing more.  Just notice me.  Thats all I ask.  Not much.  I want to feel worth noticing.  Jesss shades hid the movement of her eyes, or lack thereof, as she watched Manolo manipulate the long pole.  Jess was always careful to point her head in a different direction, to avoid detection.  Manolo never knew at least Jess hoped so.  But someone did.  A shadow obscured Jesss sun, and Jess bolted up and spilled tomato juice on her bosom.  Anthony! was her first thought, even though it was too soon for him to be home from work, if you could call busting heads work.  Was that work? No.  Anthony enjoyed busting heads too much for it to be work.  Hells knells, Jess heard a familiar female voice say.  Tense up much? Oh, thank GodNOT Anthony! Jess finally exhaled, her stomach unknotting.  Jess looked up and saw the source of the shadow was her friend and neighbor, Isabella.  Despite the hot afternoon sun, Isabella was wearing layer upon layer of black some lace, some cotton and enough beads to buy the isle of Manhattan.  Hey, Isabella, Jess said.  Just lost in thought.  Isabella, popping her ever-present gum, glanced over at Manolo and sat down on the chaise lounge next to Jesss.  Lost in thoughts of your tall, dark, and brown pool man, I bet.  Isabella grinned that wide goofy grin she sported when she teased.  She sported that grin a lot.  No, Jess lied, dabbing at the tomato juice on her chest with a paper napkin.  You know hes gay, right? Isabella asked.  He is not! Jess said.  Those muscles, and his strut no! Youre wrong.  Then again, he was extremely well groomed for a pool man.  Bi, maybe, but not gay.  Well, Isabella said, lets ask.  Hey, Manolo! Are you? Jess reached out and pinched Isabellas leg.  Isabella squealed and said, Are you too hot today? Manolo told her he wasnt and kept at his work.  Oh yes he is, Isabella whispered.  Jess pinched her again.  Youre teasing me, Jess said.  Isabella plopped her massive tote bag down on the paver patio and rubbed her thigh.  I am teasing you, but he is gay.  Stop saying that, Jess said.  Isabella had no internal censor.  Words like gay came out of her mouth full steam, and not whispered, like they should be.  If Anthony heard you The apes not home, is he? Isabella asked, her eyes darting to the house.  No, my husband isnt home, Jess replied, and then whispered, but you know how he gets all bashy when a gay person is around.  Its not safe to even joke about.  Isabella exhaled.  Youre married to a caveman, and Im glad hes not here.  Id hate to cut into you two lovebirds wooing time.  Pffft, Jess said.  You know thats not true.  It had been years since Jess thought of Anthony and her as lovebirds.  And by the time Jess stopped thinking that way, it had probably been years, if ever, that Anthony had thought of them that way.  Jess knew Anthony thought of her, when he thought of her at all, as HIS WOMAN nothing more.  Isabella is right my husband is a caveman.  So whens the last time you two had sex? Isabella asked.  Hey! Jess said, so loud that Manolo lifted his head.  Dont talk like that.  Words like that really! Manolo put his head back to his work.  Isabella was too free with words like sex.  Jess couldnt remember the last time shed used that word herself.  Even then it was probably to do a school assignment.  And Jess had graduated high school two decades ago.  Sorry, Isabella said, grinning.  Whens the last time you guys did the nasty? Bumped uglies? Made the beast with two backs? Danced the sweaty naked tango? Played randy pirate and willing wench? Jess slapped at Isabellas fleshy shoulder.  Cut it out! Now, I mean it.  Jesss face grew red, but she did start to giggle uncontrollably.  Okay, I get it, Isabella said.  A long time.  Jess pulled off her sunglasses, and her eyes cried out for help.  Is it that obvious? Yes.  Great, Jess said.  What would you say if I told you I could fix all that? Isabella asked, a glint in her eye.         		   -2-  Two days later, Isabella and Jess stood in Jesss garage, looking over Anthonys F350.  Jess had no idea what the technical definition of a monster truck was, but Anthonys truck sure seemed to qualify.  Like her husband, it was big larger than life.  And when the engine roared, just like her husband, it could not be ignored.  Jess knew for a fact there were construction workers, men who hauled iron girders by hand, that hunkered down and tried not to do anything that might draw Anthonys attention when they heard his truck rumble their way.  Jess could still remember in vivid detail, even though it was years ago, the one time shed seen Anthony tune a guy up.  Thats what he called it: tuning a guy up.  Jess supposed that went down better than the truth: assault.  Anthony wasnt the type of man who felt the necessity of niceties, so Jess assumed the euphemism was for her benefit.  Of course, that was back when Anthony used to take Jesss feelings into consideration.  Like Jesss ability to be naked with the lights on, those days were long gone.  The truck sat in the garage, taking up the whole bay.  So how will this work? Jess asked.  Simple, Isabella said.  My friend installs a circuit board under the dash, completely out of sight, and whenever Anthony plays his trucks radio, no matter what hes listening to, a subliminal message will come out of the speakers along with his station.  Who will install it? Your friend? Jess asked, her eyebrows arched.  Isabella had lots of friends.  Fine, Isabella replied, adopting a faux haughty air.  My LOVER.  She let that last word linger in the air.  God, shes incorrigible.  But so free and relaxed.  Oooh, Jess squealed.  Dont say it like that.  You make it even tawdrier, if thats possible.  Does Bill know? My husband? Isabella replied.  Of course he does.  He encourages it.  Bill wants me to be happy.  Jess spotted Isabellas eyes dart to the floor.  Jess poked Isabellas black tee between her low-hanging strands of beads.  Wait a minute, Jess said.  Youre holding something back.  You little fibber-de-libber.  Youre holding something back.  Maybe, Isabella said.  Hey, watch the beads.  Jess pulled her finger away and crossed her arms.  Isabella Sheffield, tell me your secret right now.  Well, gee, Mrs.  DAngelo, Isabella said.  Im not sure I should.  Cmon! Tell me! Fine, Isabella said.  I have one of these subliminal circuit boards inside Bills car.  An hour each way to work allows for a lot of subconscious programming time.  So you know it works.  Im certain it works, Isabella said.  Look, I know what youre thinking.  Isabella fixed Jess with a knowing gaze.  Is it just the sex thats dried up, or has Anthonys love for you dried up too? This will out the truth.  If its just a rut you guys are in, this will rekindle his passion for you.  If not, and its over, youll be able to tell.  Youll know for sure.  Damn Isabella! She had somehow figured out exactly what was on Jesss mind.  Did Anthony not love her any more? Or was this just the natural course of any long relationship? At least Isabella didnt mention Jesss darkest fear was Anthony having an affair? So what will this subconscious programming make him do? Jess asked.  Its mild, Isabella said.  Itll just make him more oral.  Hell talk more? Isabella got a playful glint in her eye.  No, silly.  Hell want to kiss you more.  Jess thought about it for a bit, but not long.  Well thatd be nice.  What would be the harm? It wasnt like she was violating his privacy or anything.  Anthony should want to kiss his wife.  Jess nodded her head.  Lets do it, she said.  It wont take long, will it? Anthony will be back with my Mercedes in about three hours.  No, Isabella said.  My loverI mean, my friend, will bang this out lickety-split.  Shes very good at what she does.  Isabella added, with a twinkle of the eye, at everything she does.  Your lover is a she? Jess giggled.  Youre baaad.  You have no idea.         		   -3-  Jess was just ladling the linguini into the cast iron frying pan filled with mussels and clams fully popped, broth at a slow boil, when she heard the garage door open.  In moments Anthony came swooping into the room.  It wasnt that her husband was in a rush he swooped into every room he entered.  Boots off, dear, Jess reminded.  Anthony stepped back to the mudroom and took off his construction boots.  Despite being a big man, Anthony bent over with an easy athleticism that a twenty-year-old would envy.  A day didnt go by that Anthony didnt hit the gym, and his body showed it.  Being big and brutally strong was required in Anthonys line of work, where he regularly had to tune guys up.  Jess never asked her husband about his work.  Most mafia wives didnt.  It was for the best.  If you didnt know anything, you couldnt be called to testify.  Jess often wondered if Anthonys mafia ties were the source of his impulse to gay-bash.  The mafia was not a progressive organization in the least.  I hope you got that furniture moved for your friend, Anthony said.  I need my truck tomorrow.  I drive up in a Mercedes and everyone thinks Im rich, and then they start thinking they dont have to pay me, and that slows me down.  Slows you down? Jess asked.  Having to remind people that they need to respect me, that takes time, Anthony said.  Ah, tuning people up.  Jess had only seen Anthony tune someone up once, in all their years of marriage.  It was brutal, and it was bloody, and it bothered Jess that she got extremely turned-on watching Anthony use his bare hands to bludgeon that guy, battering him to the ground.  What did that say about her? Afterwards, Anthony had smelled so manly, a mixture of sweat and blood not his that Jess had jumped his bones.  Of course, that was years ago.  Smells good, Anthony said.  No kiss, no hug, no how was your day.  Isabella was rightJess needed to use that subliminal programming.  There was nothing wrong with doing it, was there? Why did it feel like Jess was violating a trust? Her husband lumbered off to the half-bath in the hallway, washed up, and then sat down at the dining room table, waiting for Jess to serve him.  Im a scullery maid in my own house.  Jess placed the silver serving-bowl heaped high with pasta and seafood in front of her husband.  He dug in heartily.  Apparently tuning people up built an appetite.  Jess picked carefully at her dinner, minimizing the pasta and focusing on the seafood.  As she crested towards forty, carbs were not her friend.  What do you think about renting a movie tonight? Your pick, Jess said.  She knew that would doom her to explosions and car chases, and not the character-driven films that she enjoyed, but one made sacrifices in a relationship.  No.  Going out, Anthony said.  Business.  He took half the loaf of Italian bread and slathered it with soft butter.  For as long as theyd been married, he could eat like a teenager and not put on any fat.  Only muscle.  Lots of muscle.  Really? Jess asked.  On a Wednesday? Yep.  Cant be avoided.  Jess was left to clear the table and do the dishes while Anthony showered and put on a good suit.  He didnt kiss her goodbye.  Where have the kisses gone in their marriage? Surely there is nothing wrong with using a little hypnotism to bring back the kisses.  But why did it feel wrong? Even when Anthony came home, at past two in the morning, he didnt kiss Jess.  She pretended to be asleep while Anthony pulled off his tie and hung up his suit.  The bed listed heavily in his direction when he climbed in beside Jess.  The cool night air rode up inside her flannel nightshirt as he billowed out the sheets and made himself comfortable.  Anthonys meaty hand swallowed Jesss flannel covered shoulder as he leaned forward.  Ah, a kiss.  What was I worried about? This is a nice change.  See, I just should have been patient.  Ill tell Isabella to disconnect the subliminal circuit board.  Only it wasnt a kiss.  Anthony rolled Jess onto her belly, and he climbed on top of her.  Anthony yanked up her flannel nightshirt and pushed her knees apart.  For all he knew, she was still asleep.  Jess stared at the pillowcase blankly, well used to the routine.  We need new linens.  And maybe a new color of paint on these walls.  No kisses.  Jess didnt even get a peck on the cheek, or the back of her neckAnthony just entered her, without any foreplay or tenderness.  Jess just lay there, patiently.  She knew from experience that she would moisten up quickly, and it wouldnt hurt for long.  Anthony was a long time coming, just like when it wasnt his first time in a night.  Anthonys breath smelled of liquor, and the faint scent drifted of something.  Maybe the liquor is slowing him down.  He usually finishes pretty quickly.  Jess stared at the headboard while Anthony pounded into her.  She gritted her teeth.  He was big, her husband, and strong.  There was no use resisting, and certainly nothing to be attained by saying no, not tonight.  Jess just waited for him to finish.  What was that smell? Anthony wheezed and grunted as he went about his business.  It began to hurt less and less, which was good.  Of course, if history was any indication, by the time Jess started enjoying it Anthony would be done, and she would be left to her own devices.  Hes my husband.  Its my duty.  Jess could pick out his musk that wasnt the smell.  It was flowery.  LikeJasmine.  Oh my God! That was another womans perfume.  Son of a bitch! Jess squeezed the pillow with her fingers.  Yeah, thats right, Anthony muttered drunkenly.  Yeah.  You cheating stinker.  After all Ive done for you! Anthony released himself into Jesss angry body, and then he rolled over and went to sleep.  Any doubts as to whether or not Jess should use the subliminal programming became a far, distant memory.         		   -4-  Two weeks later, Jess checked her toenail polish for scuffs as she fastened the straps on her cork-wedge sandals.  She wore a button down blouse that revealed a healthy amount of cleavage, for her, and a flouncy print skirt.  Her waxed legs were tan from the sun and soft with aloe lotion.  Her hair was pulled back.  Jess had spent thirty minutes on her makeup.  In the kitchen, she finished squeezing the lemons and mixed a cup of sugar in the lemonade.  The glass pitcher was sweating with condensation.  She placed it, along with two iced glasses, on a bamboo serving-tray.  Jess brought the tray out to the patio.  Manolo, she called.  Take a break.  Have some lemonade.  I just made it! Manolo smiled at Jess, put down his vacuum pole, and padded over to the umbrella-shaded table.  Oh, what a smile.  There is no way hes gay.  He cant be.  Thank you, Mrs.  DAngelo, Manolo said.  Nice and cold.  It took a monster effort of will, but Jess managed to reach out and touch Manolos slick bicep.  You work too hard, Manolo.  Using the back of his forearm, Manolo wiped sweat and lemonade from his lips.  Its very sweet, he said.  Too sweet? Im sorry.  No, I like it.  Manolo smiled.  Its very sweet, like you.  Jess grew paradoxically flattered and indignant.  The last thing I want to be thought of as is sweet! Still, the compliment warmed her heart.  Tell him hes sweet too.  Tell him! No, not now.  Saturday.  Manolo, Jess said, would it be possible to pop by Saturday afternoon? Were having a party Sunday, and Id like the pool house and pool to be ship shape.  A lie.  A little lie.  Hell never know.  Why should Anthony be the only one to have fun? Jess could have tried to seduce Manolo right then and there, but she needed time to get her courage up.  Is no problem, Mrs.  DAngelo.  I can come by on Saturday.  Say something witty and charming.  Cmon Jess, say something! Yoo-hoo! Anyone home? Isabella called out.  She had let herself in through the gate and was coming around the corner of the house.  Jess pulled her hand away from Manolos arm, and Manolo noticed.  Isabella was wearing all black again, despite the heat, and she carried her huge tote bag.  There you are, she cried.  Hi Manolo.  My, youre looking fit.  Thank you Mrs.  Sheffield, Manolo said.  Then, looking a bit sheepish, Manolo put down his glass of lemonade and went back to vacuuming the pool.  Once he was out of earshot, Isabella said, You never make me fresh lemonade.  You dont deserve any, Jess said.  Why not? Whats wrong, honey? Jess plopped onto a patio chair and pulled out a tissue.  Im not going to cry.  Im not going to cry.  Itll ruin my makeup.  Anthony is cheating on me, Jess sobbed.  Isabella leaned forward and hugged Jess.  Isabellas bosom was large and soft a place of comfort.  Oh, honey, Isabella said.  Im so sorry.  Are you okay? They stayed that way for a while, and finally Isabella sat back on another patio chair.  Ive been so stupid, Jess said.  All the signs were there.  Why didnt I figure it out sooner? Honey, Isabella said, dont take this the wrong way, but we all figured you condoned it.  We? Jess cried.  Everyone knows? It seemed obvious to us.  Your caveman husband is not the most discrete.  Did you really not know? No! Jess blew her nose into her sodden tissue.  It was about to fall apart.  And your stupid hypnotic circuit board isnt working.  Its been two weeks, and he still doesnt kiss me! Isabella stroked her chin, thought for a bit, and then said, Two weeks is long enough.  Have you used the trigger? Jess finally looked straight at her friend.  Trigger? What trigger? Oh, honey, I surely told you about the trigger.  You need to scent the air to smell like lilacs.  Hell get oral with you then.  He wont be able not to.  Jess poured herself some lemonade.  Not that she was thirsty, but she needed something to do with her hands.  You didnt tell me about the trigger.  Isabella looked up at the glaring sun, and then down at Manolos tan shoulders.  I thought I did, but anyway, thats what you need to do.  Okay, Ill try it.  But I dont see the point now, Jess confessed.  Isabella rooted around in her tote bag.  She pulled out a pocket video camera.  It was digital, and needed no tape, so it was very small.  Isabella shot some video of Manolo as he worked.  What are you doing? Jess asked.  Oh, hes so good looking, Isabella replied.  I love to record good looking men, even if they are gay.  Jess grabbed the video camera from Isabellas hand and put it down on the table.  Cut it out.  Hes not gay, and I call dibs.  Okay, honey, Isabella said.  Im sorry.  Some habits are hard to break.  Speaking of bad habits, why are you going to do with your no-good cheating husband? I know a good divorce lawyer.  Divorce? Hah! Mafia wives didnt get divorced.  Sure, Mary Barone left her husband, but she had kept a file on Bruno, her husband.  Mary Barone had recorded her husband talking about heroine deals and a murder.  Anthony never discussed his business.  Divorce was not an option.  Jess was trapped.  No, Jess said.  Maybe if I use the lilac trigger, hell mend his ways.  How do I know this Love Test works, anyway? If he starts kissing me, does that mean it worked? Isabella shook her head.  No, Im afraid not.  Hell get oral, if it works, but the gist of my plan is that this will re-spark his interest in you.  You know, prime the pump, and hell only be interested in you.  If he gets oral but still acts like an ass, then youll know its over.  Jess watched Manolo move the vacuum equipment to the deep end of the pool.  Manolo moved with a physical grace that Jess found entrancing.  It doesnt sound like the best test, if you ask me, Jess said.  Sorry honey, Isabella replied.  Its the best Ive got.  The two friends moved the conversation to chitchat, and spent the afternoon watching Manolo and drinking lemonade.  It was obvious, after a while, that Manolo knew he was being watched.  Soon after Manolo finished, put his equipment in his truck, and drove away, Isabella left too.  When Jess was cleaning up, she noticed Isabellas pocket video recorder was still on the patio table.  Jess picked it up, and brought it to her bedroom, where she put it in her lingerie drawer.  Then she went out to purchase some lilac scented candles.         		   -5-  Anthony was working late that day, but he had no plans to go out after dinner.  Jess set about making his favoriteLinguini Alfredo and also managed to bake a cherry pie.  Anthony loved cherry pie.  The dining room table had a bouquet of flowers, lilacs and dragons breath, that Jess had bought while she was out getting the candles.  Shortly after seven oclock, Anthony came barreling into the kitchen.  Once again, Jess had to remind him to take off his construction boots.  Every time.  He cant break bad habits.  This is not going to work.  Busy day? Jess asked after they sat down to eat.  The usual, Anthony replied, his mouth full of pasta.  Whats with the flowers? I just wanted to spruce things up.  Remember when you used to buy me flowers? Yeah.  That was before we were married.  Husbands dont bring their wives flowers.  Anthony sniffed at the air.  Aha! The trigger! Do I smell cherry pie? Oh, so NOT the trigger! You do, Jess replied, getting up.  She knew that was his way of telling her to bring him some cherry pie.  That hypno circuit board was a hoax.  Or maybe he hasnt been listening to the radio.  Was the pool guy here today? Anthony asked.  Yes, why? Jess nervously replied.  She laid the cherry pie on the table and proceeded to cut Anthony a slice.  Her hands shook.   Anthony grabbed her wrist.  He comes here a lot, Anthony said.  So? Jess whispered.  Anthony pulled on Jesss arm and spun her so that she landed on his lap.  SO, he should get the job right on the first try.  Hed never make it working for me.  His thick hand grabbed the back of Jesss neck, and he twisted her head toward his.  He knows! He knows I want Manolo! But he didnt.  Anthony settled his lips on Jesss, and he gave her a kiss like the ones he used to give her before they were married long, and soulful.  When his lips released her, Jess said, Mmm.  What was that for? Anthony shrugged and smiled.  I dont need an excuse to kiss my woman, do I? Jess used a fork and broke off the tip of the slice of cherry pie, and then fed it to her husband.  No you dont, she said.  Never.         		   -6-  Jess cleaned up in the kitchen with a spring in her step.  Despite his past infidelities, Jess was tickled pink that Anthony had kissed her.  It took so little to make her happy, it was a wonder Anthony couldnt manage it without a hypnotic push in the right direction.  Anthony was watching baseball in the den by the time Jess was done cleaning up.  She sat and watched with him for a while, but things were no different than before.  He barely noticed her, and only spoke to her when he needed another beer.  I should have put lilacs in the den, too.  By the time the eighth inning started, Jess was ready for bed.  She went upstairs, lit the three lilac candles shed purchased that day, and changed into a red satin nightie.  This will turn his head.  It didnt.  When Jess went down to the den to tell Anthony she was going to bed, he merely grunted, and gave her a cursory once-over.  Jess had hoped the nightie would lure him upstairs before the game was over, but she now knew that was too much to ask.  Jess had fallen asleep by the time Anthony came upstairs, but like hundreds of other nights, she woke up when he entered the room.  He blew out the candles, muttering something about having to tell her not to leave them burning in the future, brushed his teeth, and took off his clothes.  The bed listed when he climbed on.  When Anthony put his meaty paw on Jesss shoulder, she thought, here we go again.  But he didnt flip her onto her belly like he always did.  Anthony eased her gently onto her back, and pressed his lips to her throat.  Mmmm, Jess said sleepily.  Anthony ran a strong hand, a hand that pummeled people on a daily basis, across her cheek.  His touch was gentle.  He pressed his lips to hers with an urgency that was a distant memory.  Jess kissed her husband back, keeping her eyes closed, and suspecting it was half a dream.  His tongue probed her lips, and then sought entry there.  Jess opened her mouth slightly, and Anthonys tongue, tasting minty fresh, ran across her teeth.  Oh, if this is a dawn of a new era, then sign me up! As Anthonys hand ran along Jesss side, her back arched, and her body reached out for him.  She cradled his head in her hands, and Anthony peppered her lips with dozens of tender pecks.  He eased his body on top of hers, and Jess spread her legs for him.  Anthony kissed the tops of her breasts as his hand stroked between her legs.  When he finally entered her, Jess was completely ready for him, and welcomed him wholeheartedly.  He continued to kiss her as they made gentle love, and for the first time in their marriage, Jess arrived at the station before he did.  It was marvelous.  But Anthony wasnt done there.  After theyd come apart, at the moment when Anthony would usually roll over and go to sleep, he slid down her body and lifted her nightie so that he could kiss her tummy.  Jesss body rolled to and fro on the king-size mattress as his lips danced around her belly button.  Ive never been so fond of the scent of lilacs! Anthonys mouth continued working south, and he did something he had once told her he would never do.  Hungrily, eagerly, and without reservation, his mouth brought her back to the station once more, and Jess thought she was having the most marvelous dream.  My God, hes orally insatiable! Its like hes in a trance! It was a night to remember.  The next day, however, was not.  After dinner, Anthony went out on business, and saw his girlfriend.  Jess didnt bother to light the lilac candles, and when Anthony came home smelling of Jasmine, Jess was glad she hadnt.  Anthony had failed the Love Test.  Now what? Jess had an idea.         		   -7-  Saturday turned out to be a beautiful day.  The sun was shining, and the forecast had no hint of rain.  Jess wore her bathing suit, with a wrap around her waist, and sat on the patio drinking iced tea.  Manolo arrived, and Jess asked him to clean the interior of the pool house before touching up the pool.  Dont blow out the candles, please, Jess said.  The pool house was filled with lilac candles, and their scent filled the air.  Jess lay back on the chaise lounge and daydreamed about Manolo being as orally fixated with her as Anthony had been the other night.  Oh, if only! A shadow blocked the sun, and Jess opened her eyes.  Anthony towered over her.  Where the fuck is my cellphone? he asked.  I had to come back from my rounds.  I left it charging in the truck, and when I got to the job site I noticed it wasnt there.  Oh, Jess said, sitting up with a start.  I used it to make a call.  I left it in the pool house.  She started to rise.  Ill get it.  In the pool house? Anthony said.  Is the pool man in there? Do you always cavort around dressed like this when the pool man is here? No, Jess lied.  Anthony put a hand on Jesss shoulder and pushed her back down.  Ill get it.  Go put some clothes on, or stay inside for Christs sake.  I cant have my woman parading around in front of the pool man dressed like that.  Anthony stormed off across the yard to the pool house.  Jess went into the house and changed into jeans and a button down shirt.  She also grabbed her purse.  When she went out to the yard, Anthony was still in the pool house.  Jess stole up to the sliding glass door, and took Isabellas miniature video camera out of her purse.  Manolo, the pool man, was sitting on the wicker couch that faced the floor-to-ceiling windows in the pool house, with his legs spread.  Jess started the video camera, and began recording.  The strong scent of lilacs in the pool house had proven too much for Anthony.  The hypnotic suggestion had kicked in, and his oral impulse, just as Jess had hoped, must have proven irresistible.  Anthonys head bobbed up and down in Manolos lap, and Jess got it all on video.  Hell never want his mafia friends to see this.  After Manolo reached his climax, he went to stand up, but Anthony pushed him back down and proceeded to have another go.  Jess taped that one too, being sure to get Anthonys face.  Once she was sure she had enough, Jess walked out to her Mercedes and pulled out of the driveway.  Jess used the cars dashboard cellphone to call Isabella.  Well, Jess said to Isabella, you were right.  Manolo is gay.  So it worked? Isabella asked.  Jess patted the video recorder on the seat beside her.  It worked, she said.  Where are you now? Isabella asked.  On my way to the divorce lawyer.  He agreed to meet me on a Saturday.  Isabella wished Jess good luck and congratulated her.  After terminating the call, Jess put the video recorder in her lap, to keep it close.  She started humming I will survive.  Jess was free at last.

He feared it would ring, yet he wanted it to ring.  As he waited for it to ring, hoping it would ring, praying it would ring, his eyes scanned the leaded glass window.  Ripples from the raging flames in the fireplace peppered the imperfect glass with bright promises of orange, but that wasnt what engaged Owens sight.  He was watching for headlights coming from cars on the road.  The rural road was not often travelled.  Usually, when a car came down the road, it was coming to the estate where Owen sat waiting in the gatehouse.  He was naked, but he was ready at a moments notice to don whatever clothing he was told to put on by the voice at the other end of the phone line.  All for Bree.  Sweet Bree.  My sweet Bree.  Owen would do anything for his Bree hed proven that over and over.  Soon it would be time to do so again.  The phone rang.  Owens stomach twisted into a knot.  Owen looked down at the table next to his wingback chair.  Beside the phone was a stack of business cards.  Well, not really business cards, but rather coupons, or redemption tickets.  They all said the same thing, scarlet lettering over a glossy black background.  Mistress Made Me.   Natural Habitat  Owen sorted envelopes, as he did every weekday, buried in a basement mailroom.  Four years on his Bachelors, and two on his MBA, and he was sorting mail in the dank basement of a third-rate office building.  Business school didnt prepare him for this economy.  And no one told him eighty thousand dollars of debt for a degree from a run of the mill school was not a good investment.  He unwrapped his Twinkie and bent to his work, pulling down his sorted piles and placing them in his pushcart.  The telltale click clack of Virginia Stiles heels sounded down the concrete hall.  Ms.  Stiles always wore the most elegant shoes, almost always high-heels, and Owen knew her gait by heart.  Owen was an aficionado of womens shoes.  He couldnt identify brands, but he knew what he liked.  It came from a lifetime spent almost always looking down.  Owen could seldom recall the color of a womans eyes, but he would always recognize her shoes.  There were two reasons for anyone to come into the basement of the building: to check on the boiler, or to stop by the mailroom.  Virginia Stiles would have no reason to check on the boiler.  Owen crammed the remaining two-thirds of Twinkie into his mouth and quickly swallowed.  Virginia Stiles detested eating on the job, junk food in particular.  Virginia Stiles stood in the doorway, her hands on each jamb, taking command of the space like she took command of every space she occupied.  Virginia Stiles tapped her toe.  Owen, she said.  Did my niece get any mail? Owens eyes traced up Virginia Stiles smooth calves, rising along her pencil skirt, and rested upon her trim waist.  Hed worked for Virginia Stiles for two years, but still didnt know if she wore glasses or how she styled her bangs.  Yes, Ms.  Stiles, Owen replied, trying to swallow down the last bit of the Twinkies delicious crme.  Yes, she did, Owen said.  He surreptitiously wiped away any Twinkie residue that might be on his mouth.  Virginia Stiles chuckled.  Be a dear and be sure she gets it as soon as possible.  I will, Ms.  Stiles.  Are you happy working here, Owen? At Pure Rile Media? Yes, I am.  No, I mean here in the mailroom.  Owen swallowed hard, thought twice, and croaked out, Not particularly, Ms.  Stiles, no.  But Im grateful for the job, and I do what needs doing.  Virginia Stiles clucked her tongue.  Thats a very good answer Owen.  Excellent, in fact.  Keep up the good work.  Carry on! Owen listened to Virginia Stiles purposeful strides up the corridor, back to the real world.  She was only fifteen years or so older than Owen, which put her in her mid-forties, yet she was in charge of this whole company.  Must be nice.  And a hot body, too.  Nice.  It wasnt until Owen was sure Virginia Stiles had exited the hallway that he rolled his cart to the service elevator.  Logic would have dictated Owen take the elevator to the top floor and work his way down, but Owen hit the button for the third floor.  He exited the elevator and rolled his way past the accounting department.  He placed a bundle of mail on Allisons desk.  Allison was the accounting departments secretary.  Hey, Owen, Allison said, half a frosted donut clutched in her pudgy, manicured fingers.  A bunch of us are going over to Jigglys after work.  Interested? I dont think so, Owen replied.  Jigglys was a Hooters-style bar, and the waitresses aggressiveness was intimidating to Owen.  Plus, there was the issue of Jigglys signature feature, the Interrogation Room.  Aw, cmon, Allison said.  Itll be fun.  Beer, wings, and laughs.  You should come out with us.  Without looking up, Owen replied, Maybe.  Well see.  Owen rolled his cart down the hall.  He rolled his cart past the ficus that needed watering, past the water cooler whose very proximity no doubt tortured the ficus, and down to the gray steel door at the end of the hall.  He knocked first, waited, and then opened the door.  Bree wasnt in the room.  Owen picked up the bundle of mail addressed to Bree Estelle.  She sure went away a lot on business.  Owen guessed that was a perk of being the niece of the boss lots of travel.  Sighing, he shut the door.  Turning around, he ran right into Virginia Stiles, who had managed to sneak up on him over the heel-muffling industrial carpet.  Oh my God, she has the greenest eyes! Owen quickly looked down.  Youre fond of my niece, arent you Owen? Excuse me? Its okay.  Bree is quite attractive.  She gets lots of suitors.  Im sorry, Ms.  Stiles, Owen sputtered.  I didnt mean to be presumptuous.  Oh, Owen, Virginia Stiles said as she settled a hand on the front of his collared shirt, dont be ridiculous.  Her palm slid down toward his pocket, and she cupped his flabby chest.  Bree doesnt like the fatties, though.  Just a word of advice.  You look like you once were in shape, dear.  I used to swim in high school, Owen replied, torn between wanting to wriggle away from Ms.  Stiles touch yet not wanting to offend.  You should get back to that, Virginia Stiles said.  Youd have a better chance of turning Brees head that way.  She removed her hand and started to turn away, but then paused and added, The gym on the first floor has a spin-class at five-fifteen.  Its free for all employees.  Think about it.  I have to get home after work, Ms.  Stiles, Owen said.  But thank you.  As you wish, Owen.  Ill tell you, thoughBree never misses a spin-class when shes in town.  It might be something youd have in common.  Virginia Stiles strutted away down the hall.  Carry on! she said with a wave of her hand.  Bree took spin-class? Sweet Bree.  Owen pondered the possibilities as he rolled his cart back up the hall.  In his pocket, his cell phone buzzed.  Owen took it out and looked at it.  His mother.  Owen wasnt supposed to answer his phone while delivering the mail, but no one could see him in this hallway.  He answered it and whispered a hushed hello.  OWEN.  WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING? Im not supposed to answer my phone at work Ma.  You know that.  NOT EVEN WHEN ITS YOUR MOTHER CALLING AND ITS AN EMERGENCY? Whats the matter Ma? I NEED YOU TO PICK UP TWO-PERCENT MILK, A QUART, AND BUTTER AND CIGARETTES ON YOUR WAY HOME.  Okay, Ma, Owen said.  I will.  See you later.  DONT FORGET.  YOU FORGOT LAST TIME.  I wont, Ma, Owen replied.  Tucking the phone back in his tight pocket, Owen looked back once more at the gray steel door at the end of the hallway.  Sweet Bree.  My sweet Bree.

1,0,"    Cologne, Germany  Two years ago  Luke rubbed his eyes, trying to clear the aggravation and exhaustion from his head simultaneously.  His mind raced with flashes and images of the previous six months, compiling a staggering montage of lights, music, chicks, booze, fights, landmarks, more booze, plane flights, brawls, interviews, parties and even more booze.   This isn't how it's supposed to happen.  He realized his words were probably a waste in the quiet hospital room.  It didn't matter.  He had some things he needed to get off his chest and Mike was the only one he told things to.  Ever.   We were gonna become mega rock stars and see the world, remember that? We had a deal.  We promised we wouldn't do all the stereotypical bull crap that so many who'd gone before us did.  We were smarter than that.   He sighed heavily and ground his teeth together at the lack of argument that came from the still figure in the bed.  Luke would prefer a straight out brawl to the steady sound of the ventilator and gentle beeping of the bedside monitor.   He wished Mike would defend himself.  Shout and yell, give him an excuse or explanation.  But the soft hum of the machines keeping him alive was the only response.   The past twenty-fours had been the worst kind of wake-up call Luke had ever received.  He'd been at a bar with Blake, ignoring Carl's incessant cellphone harassment.  All while his best friend and drummer had been rushed to a local hospital for a drug overdose.  By the time Carl got through to them, Mike was already in a coma.   No one knew what Mike had taken, but Luke suspected it was heroin.  The toxicologist would know soon enough.  The real question, the one that had Luke's stomach tied into a thousand and one knots, was whether or not Mike had done it on purpose.   You can't die.  Luke said sternly, his hands raking back his dirty blonde hair.  I need you to wake up so I can kick your ass.   He should have seen this coming.  He knew Mike was upset.  He had been for most of the tour but Luke was too busy having. . . a good time.  He didn't want to get weighed down by Mike's sour disposition.  So he had started avoiding him.  Ignoring him.   I'm sorry, his voice cracked as emotion filled his throat.  I should have been there.  I would've stopped you.   But that was a lie.  Luke had spent the majority of the tour completely wasted, he wouldn't have known what to do at all.  It was a miracle that Carl, their ever-loyal tour manager, had checked on Mike on a hunch.  And it still might not have been in time.   Seriously, wake up.  Luke said again, swallowing hard.  I don't know what happened with Ilsa and I don't know where we go after all of this but I promise. . . I promise you won't go through it alone.  And I promise I'll be the brother to you that you always were for me.   Hot tears dripped down Luke's face.  But you can't die. . . You just can't.        1    Keep Your Eyes Open      Lenny glanced down at the silver and pearl face of her watch again.  Ten more minutes, plenty of time.  She pulled open the large glass door to the downtown Los Angeles business building.  Her blonde hair reflected briefly in the mirrors behind the front desk as she strode purposefully past security to the elevators around the corner.  Going to an interview in a building where her father owned half the floors gave her a twinge of guilt, but nothing more.   The lobby was a smattering of suits, briefcases and clacking high heels.  Lenny pressed the button to the lift, shifted on her feet considering her options, and then started up the stairs without waiting.   She took the stairs two at a time at a full sprint, taking advantage of the need to expel some of her nervous energy.  She didn't bother removing her high heels and smirked to herself at how stubborn she was about even the smallest things.  She couldn't squelch the anticipation that built in her with every stride; as if she was finally headed in a direction that was taking her somewhere better than where she had been.  Her long legs quickly carried her to the third floor where she exited, barely winded.  She straightened her pressed white blouse and strode to the receptionists desk coolly.   The woman behind the desk looked up at Lenny's approach with a practiced smile.  May I help you? Her deep red hair was pulled back into a tight bun and her wide green eyes were framed by thick, trendy glasses.   I have an appointment with Jerry Douglas, Lenny responded professionally, My name is Lenny Evans.  She almost hesitated saying her full name, but decided that it was highly doubtful the receptionist would recognize it.  The woman gave her a split-second double-take; Lenny kept her face impassive.  The woman narrowed her eyes slightly but waved her to a seat with a perfectly manicured hand and picked up the phone to announce her arrival.   Lenny sat in the chair stiffly.  She hated the scratchy fabric of her dress pants against her legs and the pinch that accompanied wearing heels.  Hopefully it would be worth it.  She could suffer a few minutes of physical discomfort if it meant changing the direction her life had been going.  Nearly any new direction would be welcome at this point.   She adjusted her small purse on her lap, more practical than eye catching, and thought again about the conversation she'd had with Simone the night before.   Simone, the long-suffering girlfriend of her brother Scott, was a well-established photographer from the east coast.  At a shoot the day before, she had overheard a conversation involving an immediate job opening and called Lenny that evening.   I didn't get a lot of details but apparently the job is for a personal assistant and there's a lot of travel involved.  Simone's voice was hushed, as if she didn't want anyone to overhear her.  That made sense, she was probably with Scott.  And if Scott knew Lenny was looking for a way out he'd pitch a fit.  Older brothers tended to assume they could run the lives of their siblings.   Thanks, Simone.  Lenny scribbled down the phone number.  I owe you one.   Lenny had called the number and set up an interview immediately.  The required travel was the most appealing part.  She needed to get away.  Now.  She really didn't care, apart from prostitution or porn, what she had to do to make that happen.   Double doors opened to her right, and a short, bald man in a suit came out to greet Lenny.  When she entered the posh office, she was surprised to see another man already sitting in one of the chairs in front of the desk.  Baldy shook her hand and introduced himself as Jerry Douglas.   This is Carl Darrow, he motioned to the second man who had already stood up and was reaching his hand to Lennys.   His attire was very different from Mr.  Douglas, wearing plain blue jeans, a faded green t-shirt and scuffed cowboy boots.  She noted his hand was calloused when she shook it and his posture indicated he was just as uncomfortable in his surroundings as she was.  His brown eyes narrowed at her and he ran a hand roughly through his hair as he looked her up and down and failed to hide his grimace.   Lenny, is it? He asked, his voice edged with annoyance.   Lenny nodded and smiled, Or Lenna.  It was my grandmothers name.   We sorta thought you were a guy from your resume.  He waived at the paper on Jerry's desk that she had faxed over that morning.  He didn't even try to hide his disappointment as he seated himself again and Lenny heard Jerry sigh in exasperation.   Happens all the time, Lenny tried to reassure him, taking a seat in the chair Jerry offered her.  She avoided crossing her legs completely and just crossed her ankles, turning her knees out to the side in the most ladylike posture she could manage.   The men exchanged glances and both sat down.  Lenny got the impression they had already made their decision but were going to go ahead with the interview anyway.  She swallowed hard and squared her shoulders.   This job might be a littleunconventional for you, Jerry began, searching for the right words, trying to be delicate.  Its long days, long nights, hard physical labor and youd be on the road constantly.  His eyes skittered around his desk and his hands straightened his pen, then his name plate, then his pen again.   Is it because I'm a chick? She asked, seeing the slight break in his serious demeanor and his eyes flicked to Carl.   Carl slouched back in his chair and rubbed his chin with his fingertips.  No, it's 'cause you're pretty.   Lenny felt her mouth tug up slightly on one side.  She could see him measuring her, gauging her reaction, testing her.  So she remained silent.   Carl studied her placid silence for a long while.  But it was Jerry who asked the next question.  What makes you think that being an assistant is where you'd. . . fit?  I'm organized, I work hard and I have nothing keeping me in town, she answered honestly.  I'm not afraid of dirt and sweat and I know I can do the job well.             Carl watched closely as Lenny and Jerry discussed the ins and outs of the job.  She was focused on Jerry but her expansive eyes would flit around the room occasionally, as if taking inventory.   Her resume said she was twenty-five with little to no employment history but she projected a calm self-assurance that hinted at a wisdom that was gained only by experience.   Jerry seemed flustered at her confidence and Carl could see the interview was getting away from him.  The worse he tried to make the job sound, the more interested she became.   Carl was impressed with her quick thinking and directness.  He had been hesitant when she had first entered the room, her obvious beauty could be more of a hindrance to the job than a help.  However, she didn't seem to be trying to use any womanly wiles to make the interview go more in her favor.   Carl sat back in his chair and laced his hands together behind his head.  You realize this isn't a glamorous job? He interrupted, drawing her gaze to him.  You'll basically be a glorified babysitter.  You'll haul their shit, keep track of their schedules and have eyes on them at all times.   Easy as pie.  She didn't break eye contact and he found himself reassured by her self-possession instead of intimidated by it like Jerry had been.   Carl had actually wanted to avoid hiring a woman if at all possible.  Jerry had given him the scripted speech on sexism in the workplace and Carl had finally agreed to hiring an ugly woman. . . if it came to that.  But the young lady sitting before them was the antithesis of ugly.   He turned his tone severe and his frown deepened, Make no mistake, I'm not paying you to be their girlfriend.  You cannot, under any circumstance, sleep with them.  Do you understand?  Loud and clear.  Lenny matched his expression and Carl had to hold back a smile.  She was definitely not what he had expected.   He sighed and ran both hands through his hair while looking up at the ceiling.  He chuckled sardonically, I have no idea why I'm even entertaining the thought of hiring you.  You are exactly the kind of girl that can bring this tour crashing down.   Listen, I know Im a chick and I know Im not what you expected, she started, refusing to be deterred, But Im stronger than I look and I'm a fast learner.  I can do the job and I'll do it well.  She repeated, her jaw flexing lightly under her skin and Carl heard the desperation that she tried to hide in her voice.  Why did she need this job so badly?  He knew Jerry was watching him, waiting for an indication of some kind but he couldn't look away from the determined stare of her midnight blue irises.  She was serious, she meant business, and he believed her.  Somewhere in her life she had learned to fight for what she wanted.   When he spoke again his attitude had changed from skeptical to decided.  I've been with these guys for nearly twenty years.  They tend to be pretty self-destructive and I need someone on the inside.  Not just an assistant.  I need someone who can be their best friend but stay loyal to me.  They have to trust you, need you and like you.  I can't have another tour riddled with scandal and the guys have promised they've changed but. . .  He rolled his eyes and rubbed his chin dejectedly.   They're so stubborn, he growled, they keep insisting they don't need an assistant.  He shook his head in frustration.  They have argued with me about it every step of the way.  They hate the idea of having someone they haven't picked themselves basically be in charge of their lives for the next six months.  They have more trust issues than I do.   He sucked air in through his teeth as a fresh thought crossed his mind.  His eyes flashed at Lenny and a slow smile spread across his face.   What? Lenny asked apprehensively, her eyes lighting up as she realized that the job was in her reach.   I'm gonna stick you on the plane with them tomorrow.  Let them think you're another passenger.  If you use as much charm on them as you have on us, they'll hire you themselves.   That's pretty sneaky, Carl, she pointed out, arching one eyebrow at him.   I'm out of options, kid.  These guys have been the collective pain in my ass ever since I walked into their garage and told them to keep it down.  They have so many hoops to jump through, you have no idea.   He shook his head and looked over her again.  I like you, Lenny.  I almost feel bad asking you if you want the job.  It might ruin your life.   Carl watched Lenny as she considered all of the information.  At first glance, with her blonde up-do and flawless skin, he thought she was just another pretty face.  But she had a spark in her she couldn't hide.  A spunky cockiness that appealed to him.   She was undoubtedly perfect for this job.   You're making a good choice, Carl.  She gave him a half-smile and Carl was surprised at his own sense of relief that flooded his veins.   For the next twenty minutes the three of them went over the confidentiality agreement and the touring schedule.  She signed some paperwork and asked hardly any questions.  They all shook hands and she left.   Carl stared after her, lost in his own musings.  He had complete confidence that they had found the ideal person.   That was easier than I expected, Jerry broke into his thoughts.  I wasnt sure youd find what you were looking for.  Considering. . . everything.   Shes perfect, Carl agreed.   I sure hope this works out for you.  Better than the last tour anyway.   It will, Carl said matter of fact as he started to gather his things.  He couldn't wait to get out of this office and have a cigarette.  He hated coming to this building but Jerry insisted they do the interview in his office.  Saying something about how Carl's smelled like cigarette butts and coffee.   What makes you so sure she wont run off with one of them and end up in the tabloids? Jerry attempted to joke.   Shes got a brain, Carl responded.  Besides, she didnt even ask what band shes working for.  Not once, He took a breath and picked up his bag, Whatever shes looking for, it isnt fame and drama.             Lenny sat patiently in the plane next to the window.  It had been a long time since she had flown anywhere alone and she was kind of excited.  She tried to suppress the giddiness in her belly, knowing the plane would take off soon and her new adventure would start.  The text message she had sent before boarding had been the final goodbye to be said.   The ticket was waiting for her at the counter like Carl had promised and that was what made Lenny realize this was really happening.  She was really doing it.   Always early, she was first to board the plane and assumed the band members would be along shortly.   Hey, beautiful.  An attractive man with sculpted shoulders and long, dirty blonde hair pulled back into a low ponytail greeted Lenny.  She smiled politely as he sat down next to her.  He must have been in his late twenties.  His ratty blue jeans and worn, Chuck Taylor's seemed out of place in the first class seating but Lenny didn't mind.   How did I get a seat next to you? He asked her flirtatiously, his pale blue eyes sparkling with mischief.   Lenny shrugged and played it cool, remembering her instructions from Carl.  Probably luck, she replied coyly.   Story of his life, the bastard.  Another voice joined their conversation from across the aisle.   Lenny leaned over to see what she assumed to be two more band members seating themselves adjacent to them.  Another two men plopped into the seats in front of her as well.  They were all in their late twenties to early thirties, had rumpled clothes on, and dark circles under their eyes.  As she looked more closely, she began to recognize them.   Going on vacation? The friendly young man next to her kept the dialogue going.   Looking for a change of pace and a new job, Lenny replied, not exactly lying.  She was pleased that she wouldnt have to work too hard to get their attention.  When Carl had said she was supposed to befriend them, she wasnt exactly sure how that would happen.  But it seemed they were impressed with a pretty smile and a hair flip.  At least this one was.   He grinned at her and asked, Unemployed and sitting in first-class? How is this possible?  I have wealthy parents.  She explained strategically, realizing her slip.  She tilted her head and smiled sweetly, hoping they could skip the details about her life.   Im Sway, he introduced himself and stuck out his hand, not truly interested in Lennys back story.   She grasped it strongly and replied, Im Lenna.   Beautiful name for a beautiful girl, he winked at her and Lenny suppressed an eye roll.  It wasn't exactly the most original line she'd ever heard.  She let her hair fall over her face as she dipped her eyes, thankful that she could hide behind it, pretending to be flattered.  Her physiology didn't normally respond to a guy flirting with her, she had always told herself she was far too practical for things like butterflies and blushing.  And she couldn't respond as she really wanted to because her new job required her to be friendly- whatever that meant.   Her hair was not in its usual tight braid.  The elastic restraint had broken in the airport and she was forced to let it hang loose, something she had grown to hate over the past couple of years, but was now finding it a very useful curtain.   Sway, if that was indeed his name, though Lenny doubted it, wasn't traditionally handsome.  His face was wide and angular with high cheekbones and soft, full lips.  His skin was smooth, freshly shaved, not even a hint of stubble.  His fine, blonde hair was probably shoulder length, though it was hard to tell since he had it casually pulled back.  Lenny looked at his unbroken elastic with envy; Sway caught her gaze and gave her a suggestive eyebrow waggle.  Lenny fought back a chuckle and looked away with feigned shyness.   Out the window, the plane was rising off of the runway and into the air while the flight attendants were going through their perfectly practiced speeches.  She swallowed hard to compensate for the pressure change and tried not to think about home.   She had left a note for her parents with very little explanation.  Her mom would be unreasonably worried, which is why she avoided the conversation altogether.  They would never understand.  They had always struggled with comprehending the majority of her life decisions, but even more so in the last couple of years.   As her thoughts kept following their path, her chest started to burn with an irritatingly familiar heartache.  She closed her eyes and leaned back in her seat, deliberately pushing those old thoughts and feelings away.  The past was the past and she couldnt change anything, so there was no reason to think about it.   Her hand clutched her phone and she checked to make sure she had turned it off at the attendant's reminding.  She knew she had though, she had powered it down before boarding, not looking forward to the inevitable string of irate replies when she had to turn it on again.             Luke Casey tried to catch a glimpse of the gorgeous girl tucked between his bass player and the window across the aisle from him without being too obvious.  It was a rare occurrence when a woman didnt start giggling nervously at Sway's obvious flirtation.  But he could tell right away that this girl wasn't like others.   He and his band mates had seen her at the airport waiting to board the flight.  The entire airport couldnt help but notice her, or maybe that was just how Luke saw it.  She was dressed plainly in cut-off jeans and a white t-shirt, her long, naturally blonde hair hung past her shoulders.  It wasn't bottle-blonde like so many of the other girls in SoCal and Luke wondered if maybe she wasn't a local.   She had an energy that was captivating.  Even sitting still in the airport, Luke could sense an underlying passion just below her smooth surface, like rushing water beneath a frozen river.  She had the kind of beauty that reminded Luke of sunsets and mountain vistas.  Natural, wild and dangerous.   And she had no idea.  Maybe that's why Luke couldn't get her out of his head.   She had fidgeted slightly while she waited for the call to board their flight.  Luke noticed her chewing the inside of her cheek as she quickly tapped out a text and then pocketed her phone.  Her build said she was probably an athlete, her toned legs hinted she was a runner.  Luke wondered vaguely what she was running from.   Now, as he finally got an unobstructed view of her face in the early morning light, he could see her brow furrowed in deep thought, as if trying to will a memory away.  On her lap she clutched a notebook with a pen in the spiral.   Are you a journalist? Sway asked.  Luke knew full well she was not, journalists tended to give off a certain aura that repelled him.  However, he was actually thankful that his pushy friend was keeping her talking.   Lennys eyes fluttered open and she looked at the notebook in her lap, No, just a poet, she said absentmindedly.  Luke strained, trying to listen in on their conversation without being obvious.  Damn Sway for getting the seat next to her.   Oh, so its a book of secrets, is it? Sway's tone staying light.  He could never resist a pretty girl.   Lenny winked, Everyone has secrets.  She smiled easily and changed the subject, Why are you going to Chicago?  Luke could tell Sway was enjoying her spunky back and forth.  Were heading there to kick off our tour, he answered with a hint of pride and Luke rolled his eyes.   Lenny frowned, Tour? Are you in a band?  Laughter and snickers erupted from the other members as they overheard.  Sway smiled, pretending to be embarrassed that she didnt know who he was.  I guess you could say that, he took a bottle of water from the drink cart as it passed.  Im sorry, I thought I introduced myself.  Im Ryan Sway Schaeffer, bass player for a band called Double Blind Study.   Lenny's brows drew together, Okay. . .   Sway wasnt disappointed.  Instead, he grinned from ear to ear, showing her his dazzling, perfect teeth.  Were kind of a big deal, he bragged.   Is that why you thought I would be impressed with your flattery? I imagine most girls are, Lenny raised an eyebrow pointedly and Luke smirked.  Girls didn't tend to call Sway out on his obvious self-important air.  Luke was even more compelled to get to know this one better.   Sway continued to grin.  Of course, he admitted.   Why are you smiling then? Lenny narrowed her eyes at Sway.   Youre obviously not like most girls.  Ill have to change my tactics.   Lenny was rolling her eyes when Luke had heard enough and crossed the aisle, grabbed Sway by the arm and pulled him to his feet.  You talk too much, Sway, he said, almost scolding.  He took Sways vacant seat and turned to Lenny, Sorry, he can be pushy with pretty girls.   With girls in general, Blake, who was sitting ahead of Lenny, snorted.   I resent that! Sway defended as he sank into Luke's empty chair, I have never hit on an ugly girl.   Good job, dude.  Im sure that little statement will convince her that you are, in no way, a pig, Mike said sarcastically from next to him.   Sway turned to him, Thanks for backing a bro up.             Lenny was amused at their interaction, they reminded her of her brothers.  But she couldn't get distracted, she had a job to do.  Time to become their new best friend.   Lenny had been blessed with a photographic memory.  It came in handy more often than not, allowing her to learn tasks quickly and become proficient in them.  She noticed and stored details as precisely as a computer.  It was her best kept secret, and she had always used it to her advantage.   The guy who had switched seats and was now sitting next to her was the lead singer of the group.  Double Blind Study had been her favorite band for some time now.  Hard rock with a bit of metal influence.  They hadnt toured in two years because of the drummer doing hard drugs when they were overseas and landing in the hospital.  The tabloids ripped them apart, sensationalizing the truth of the matter.  They printed gossip and pointed blame on drinking, girls and the bands inability to get along with one another.  The band members refused to do interviews and took a hiatus.  Their fame skyrocketed.  Fans demanded new music and a follow up tour.   She covertly studied Luke Casey sitting next to her.  He was casually browsing through a guitar magazine, not as interested in her as Sway had been.  His short blonde hair was covered by a Celtics ball cap, not a surprise since most of them were natives of Boston.  His gray t-shirt was snug against his lean but muscular chest and shoulders.  Tattoos leaked out from his short sleeves and down to his elbows.  Despite his rumpled appearance and worn jeans, he smelled clean and his face was shaved smooth.  His reputation was one of smoldering sex appeal and refusal to get tied down.  Typical lead singer qualities.   Lenny put on her most amicable smile, tucked her hair behind one ear and asked, Are you guys always this nice to each other? She still hadn't gotten a clear view of Luke's face, and she was wondering if he was as good looking in person as in the magazines.  Not that it should matter, she was now on the payroll and Carl had been pretty specific about how he felt with her 'fraternizing' with the band members.  However, those facts did nothing to extinguish her curiosity.  She was still a woman, after all.   Pretty much.  He thought for a minute, seemingly engrossed in the periodical, then added, We look out for each other.  Some of us dont know our weaknesses as well our friends do.  You need someone to watch your six.  He turned his stunning blue eyes on Lenny, You know what I mean?  Lenny nodded her head even as an electric current ripped through her body.  She knew exactly what he meant but she couldnt speak for a moment as her voice had gotten stuck in her throat while she had been busy trying to figure out exactly what shade of blue Luke Caseys eyes were.   He was everything she was afraid he would be.  The pictures didn't do him justice.  He was even more gorgeous while in motion, as if his raw masculinity had to be felt and no camera would ever be able to capture it.  And his voice, that voice that could go from soothing and melodic to a fury filled growl in a span of micro seconds, was washing over her like a warm rain shower.  She tried not to stare at his perfectly chiseled jaw line as he spoke more words to her.  Words she was going to need to respond to any minute.   I totally agree, she suddenly blurted out.  She didnt know what she had just agreed to, but Luke seemed satisfied so it must have made sense on some level.  She inwardly cursed herself for turning into an instant jellyfish and resolved to not let her hormones ruin this.  She just wouldnt look at his eyes.  Or his smile.  Or his arms.  Oh, geez, his arms.   This was unexpected, and in no way normal for her.  Her body was betraying her logical practicality.  She took a breath and resolved to shake it off.  She was nothing if not a professional.  Lenny had been ignoring attractive men her whole life, Luke Casey would be no different.  Right?            You have a lead on a job in Chicago? Luke was trying to be polite but he couldnt help feeling uneasy.  He had purposed to rescue her from Sway before Sway could start humping her leg.  Now Luke found himself trying not to talk to her too eagerly.  He kept trying to meet her eyes, they were the deepest blue he had ever seen, almost sapphire.  But she continuously looked around the cabin.   Nothing definite, just an impulse, Lenny smiled, and Luke couldnt help but wonder what it would be like to kiss those perfect lips.   You look familiar, Harrison was up on his knees in his seat and had turned around to join their conversation.  Luke was both thankful and annoyed at the distraction.   Maybe you saw me at the airport.  Lenny raised her eyebrows in an obvious gesture.   Harrison chuckled at himself, Yeah, that was probably it.  He stuck out his hand, Im Harrison O'Neil, I play lead guitar in the band youve never heard of.   Lenny grasped his hand and Luke was surprised at the sudden surge of jealously that filled his gut when they touched.  He pushed it aside quickly.  He was not going to lose his head over a girl he didn't know.   You have gorgeous eyes, Lenna, Harrison blurted out what Luke and Sway hadnt gotten to yet.  Luke glared at Harrison discreetly but Harrison either didnt notice or didnt care.   Thanks, Lenny accepted the compliment and then added her own, You have gorgeous hair.   Harrison blushed and immediately ran his fingers through his luscious locks.  He worked really hard at making his hair look effortless and Luke knew he enjoyed people complimenting it.   Lenny seemed amused at his reaction and gave him a small, lopsided smile and added, You can call me Lenny, everyone else does.   Lenny? That's rather unique, and kind of manly, Harrison waggled his eyebrows and Luke had to suppress his laugh.  Harrison flirting was the exact opposite of Sway.  No matter how hard the guy tried, he couldn't help but come across as adorable and was immediately 'friend zoned. '  Lenny laughed lightly at Harrison's remark and her eyes darted to Luke's.  I guess I've always been more comfortable just being one of the guys, she explained.  Luke felt disappointment drift across him when he realized they had all just been 'friend zoned. '  Harrison didn't seem to mind though, and he kept the conversation going.  The rest of the band members began to join in the discussion, and Luke was impressed with how well Lenny held her own.  She stayed active in the dialogue, adding jokes and quips.  Luke had known these guys a long time and it could be difficult getting a word in edgewise, but Lenny fit in like a missing piece that they didn't know had been missing.  That was a weird thought.  Don't go down that road, Casey.   Luke did, however, notice that Lenny continuously steered the conversation back to the band.  She spoke very little about herself and the guys preferred it that way.  They were entertainers for a reason.   The attendant with the drink cart made another pass and he paused at their row.  Luke looked up to see the young man looking at Lenny like he was trying to place her.  Luke frowned and turned to her as well.  She was still talking to Harrison, having not yet noticed the attendant.  Was he just checking her out? That was kind of unprofessional, Luke criticized internally.   Can I help you, man? He finally asked the gawker.   I'm sorry, I just, uh, I. . .  the young man swallowed and tried again having gotten Lenny's attention now.  You look really familiar.   Wow, this guy was serving drinks to rock stars and yet he'd decided to hit on a passenger with one of the worst lines available.  Luke was the opposite of impressed.   I get that a lot.  Lenny smiled apologetically.  I guess I have one of those generic faces.   Oh, sorry.  Th attendant turned red and shuffled on his way.   Luke wanted to disagree loudly with Lenny's assessment of herself.  Generic? Was she joking?            Lenny eased back into the conversation, letting it flow and grow around her.  She'd almost panicked when the flight attendant had nearly identified her.  That would end her new career before it really got underway.  She couldn't risk the shadow of what she was running from decide where she was going.   That brought her back to the band and her goal to win them over.  She was finding herself really liking these guys.  They were friendly and good-humored and made her feel equally witty and important.  That didnt surprise her; Lenny had always gotten along with guys better than girls.  It came from having three older brothersand of course the male dominated sport she had just abandoned.   The drummer, Mike Osborn was sitting beside Sway.  He was tall and lanky, tattoos spiraled up and down his arms and his hair was a shaggy, caramel color.  He hadnt shaved in a few days, as evidenced by the dark shadow cast across his jaw.  He seemed to be the most subdued of the group, even though he was constantly smacking his legs to a beat in his head.   How did you guys come up with your band name? Lenny kept the conversation moving with the intent of learning as much as she could about them and preventing them from asking about her.  And the band name had always seemed a little ambiguous.   Its kind of a long story, Luke shifted uncomfortably in his seat.   Lenny pushed his knee flirtatiously, Cmon, you can tell me.  The longer she spoke with them, the more comfortable she got and the more Luke Casey's effect on her dulled.  Lenny was pleased to know she still had a handle on her own brain, rock star or not.   Luke looked over at Sway who shrugged, I dont care, man.  You already ruined any chance of seduction on my part.  Its still a better name than what Blake thought up.   Trophy Wives would have been an amazing name, you jag, Blake Diedrich said from the seat directly in front of Lenny.   Blake was also a guitarist, but played the grungier side of their songs.  He was older than the rest of them and had come from a different band years ago.  He was more punk rock than metal rock, but his sound blended nicely with the rest of the group.  Blake had turned around a few times during the conversation and Lenny hadn't missed the appraising gaze that came from his green eyes.  He was tall and lean with jet black, short, spiky hair and just like all the other band members, he had tattoos and muscles.   They could easily fit in with the guys Lenny worked out with at her local gym.  Or a random biker gang.   I always liked Taco Night, Sway smiled impishly.   Anything is better than Taco Night, Mike interjected, receiving a scowl from Sway.   So, you guys just picked a name out of a hat or what? Lenny was trying to follow along.   Harrison turned around to face her and Luke again, Heres the deal, we grew up in Boston, right? He waited for Lenny to nod so he knew she was paying attention.  Okay, Sway has always had apenchant for the ladies.  Lenny looked over at Sway who winked and she resisted another eye roll.  When he was only seventeen he started to sneak onto the campus at Boston University to scam on college chicks.   Why college chicks? Lenny asked, her mouth ticking up on one side.   Because college chicks are experienced and usually pretty easy, Sway said matter of fact.   Dude, Mike grimaced with disapproval.   Anyway, Harrison continued, BU does a lot of research, and some girls picked up on the fact that Sway wasnt a student.  They developed an experiment in order to study attraction and how strong a teenage boys libido could be.  They did a double blind study in which Sway didnt know he was part of an experiment and neither did the girls he was scamming on.  It was going great for them until Sway got caught by campus police.  They threw him out and threatened to turn him in on charges of seduction.   Is that real? Lenny asked, incredulous.   Yeah, Frank Sinatra was charged for it too, you know, Sway said, making a sexy face and blowing Lenny a kiss.   Lenny shook her head and waited for Harrison to finish.   My sister was the one who organized the study, thats how I found out about it, Harrison folded his hands together and rested his chin on his knuckles.  We decided that our band was basically that, a double blind study to the public where they didnt know they were part of it and neither did we.  Course were more sober now than when we started.  So I suppose were more aware of our actions.   Yeah, and you really dont want to have to go to all the trouble of changing your album covers and t-shirts, Lenny teased.   And Blake would have to get that tattoo removed, Harrison added.   You tattooed the name of your own band on yourself?! Lenny pulled herself up to look at Blake, Lemme see it.   Blake tried to feign annoyance but he clearly liked the attention.  He stood up on the plane and yanked his shirt up to expose his impressive six-pack and the large tattoo scrawled in black ink across the width of his chest:  DOUBLE BLIND STUDY  Thats nice and subtle, Lenny said sarcastically with a grin.   I was excited Blake tried to defend, putting his shirt back down.   Dude, you were drunk, Harrison corrected.  Blake shrugged in confession.   Blake came back with the tattoo and we didnt have much of a choice after that, Harrison finished his story.   They spent the entire flight laughing and entertaining Lenny.  They talked easily, having no reservations about her seemingly innocent presence.  She had built the perfect platform for her next statement.  It was time to cast the net.   You guys make it sound fun but hard.  I wish I could come along to help you out, her voice light and sweet.  This was it.   They all exchanged glances, momentarily silent.  Harrison spoke first, Actually, we do need an assistant-  Dude! Blake smacked him.   Ow! Harrison protested, rubbing his arm.  What?! Maybe itll get Carl off our back!  They all seemed to consider this for a minute.  Luke turned to Lenny and asked, What do you say Lenny? You wanna join a bunch of ugly, smelly guys for a few months?  Lenny smiled.  Her plan had worked.  She nodded at all of them and kept her tone even as she replied, What do you mean? Like, work for you? She tried to look confused.   Yeah, Harrison's face lit up, Then you can hang out with us every day.   That would be amazing, Lenny smiled but she noticed Luke's eyes shift down and away from hers.  The other members were already discussing how they could sell the idea to Carl but Luke remained silent.  He'd already given his verbal approval and Lenny got the distinct impression that Luke was the leader in more areas than just lead singer.  If he had disagreed with this than the deal would have been off.   Luke suddenly came back to the conversation and his easy smile returned.  Whatever he had been thinking about had been settled and Lenny tried to push his obvious discomfort with her to the back of her mind.  She would just have to prove to him that she could do the job.        2    Times Like These      Shane: Lenny won't answer her phone or any of my texts      Cody: so it's over then  Id think you'd be happy about this      Shane: she didn't tell you where she was going?      Cody: Nope.   But you know her, she's not big on confrontation      Shane: do you think she remembers?      Cody: it's been 2 years  pretty sure it would've come up by now  relax, you're finally off the hook  we both are            Luke was uneasy.  Again.  Hiring Lenny excited him and he knew it shouldn't.  She was gorgeous, and that would present a whole set of issues.  But, she was also smart and seemed to genuinely fit into the dynamic of the group.  It had been a long time since Luke had gotten this flustered over the presence of the opposite sex.  It was like being a teenager all over again, hence the unease.   Luke wasnt the oldest, but he felt the most responsibility for the rest of the guys.  The band had always looked to him to be the leader, in more ways than simply musically.  Luke took it all in stride.  He had no problem being the one everyone else expected to make the hard decisions, the one to lead by example.  After what had happened in Germany two years ago to Mikewell, he couldnt let anything like that happen again.   Luke was aware of Carl's apprehension in regards to the tour and what obstacles could potentially arise.  He couldnt see that they had grown up and things were different now.  At least, they all hoped they were different.   Their opening show in Chicago went smoothly.  They had gone directly from the airport to the venue, meeting Carl backstage and presenting Lenny to him.  Carl had been annoyed, not unexpectedly.  They were always coming up with new ways to make his job harder than it needed to be.  Most of the time Carl's veto held solid, but he had caved under Harrison's pleas and Blake's outright promise of defiance.  The band did need an assistant, and Lenny had been the most decent candidate to come along in a while.   Decent candidate, Luke rolled his eyes as he recalled Sway's description of the newest member of their entourage.  They had each driven away a number of women in the past, be it from heartbreak, exhaustion or restraining order.  Luke felt his gut clench at the thought that Lenny would eventually be another casualty of their fame.   But maybe not.  She didn't seem nearly as naive as most women he'd known over the years.  She was audacious and self-aware.  If she had any insecurities or illusions about what her job would be, it wasn't obvious.  And with the guys new commitment to being straight laced and sober for the first time in their lives, she just might have a chance of leaving this tour emotionally intact.   Luke raked his fingers through his hair and let out a sigh.  He shouldn't be having so many thoughts about the new girl.  It was a dangerous path to start down.  Luke found it unusual that the rest of the group was so taken with her, they barely knew her.  However, he couldn't judge, as he was the one standing on his hotel balcony devoting every stray thought to her.  He sighed again and tried to shake some new thoughts into his distracted brain.   He truly felt like the only one who was apprehensive about adding a female into the mix this early in the tour.  It had turned out so badly last time.  But then again, that wasn't the fault of the women around them; that had been their own poor choices.   His hotel room was on the top floor; and just below he could see the buses getting loaded.  They would travel by bus for the tour through the States, and then fly overseas for a few shows in Europe.  Departure was to be early in the morning, about twelve hours from now.  This was probably the only night they would get a hotel, at least for a while.  He and Mike would share a bus while Sway, Harrison and Blake would share another.  They had five sleeper buses to accommodate the large crew that their show required which is where Lenny would ride.   Things were sure different than when they started out ten years ago.   Luke returned to the interior of the room and closed the sliding glass door.   Mike came in from the hallway and crashed face first onto one of the beds, Holy shit, Im tired.   Luke chuckled, Maybe you shouldve slept last night instead of practicing your bluff so late.   Practice makes perfector something like that.  Mike closed his eyes, Im gonna sleep now.  Go away or be quiet.   Luke left the room quietly, thinking that a walk might do him some good.  Maybe he could help with something.  He hated sitting around anyway.   His nerves were more than likely in direct correlation to the huge tour they were embarking on at dawn and had nothing to do with the chick who seemed to be at the forefront of his thoughts.  He had to keep his head clear.  He had to stay alert.  If he wanted this band to not only survive the industry but their own past mistakes, he needed to focus on the music.  Not on Lenny's thousand watt smile.   Easier said than done.   Carl put you to work already? He asked as he came up beside her.  The wind was tossing loose strands from her tied back hair around her face.  She turned to smile at him and his stomach tightened.  She was crazy beautiful.   I like to stay busy.  Lenny noticed Lukes frown as he chastised himself internally and she misunderstood its meaning.  I cant justify being your assistant if Im not actually assisting.   Carl gave me the low down on what's allowed on the buses and what's not, she gestured to the checklist in her hand and motioned for him to follow her inside the bus.  She pointed out the items as she listed them, You have all your gear and favorite foods on board.  A fully stocked fridge with soda and water, she emphasized, and not the cheap kinds, mind you, but the good stuff.  Luke followed her through the interior of the bus as she showed him where the sheets and and towels were located.  And I went ahead and programmed my number in your phone.   Luke looked down at her hand and saw her extending his iPhone towards him.  He took it and his thumb slid across the face as he tried to figure out what to say.  Why did her presence muddle his thoughts?  So you can call me when you need anything, she smiled at his blank face and bit her bottom lip.  Probably to keep from laughing at his total lack of cool.   You didnt have to do all this for me.  This was the first time they had really been alone and Luke was aware of the close proximity they were in, standing in the main lounge of the bus.  It was unnerving.  And intoxicating.   Lenny laughed, Not just you, all the guys, she shook her head slightly at his expression, I already gave the others their phones.  You're the last one to finally wander down here.   Luke stared at her, realizing she was only doing her job.  Taking care of him, of them, was her job.  He looked down at the phone in his hand.  They had a working relationship.  She wasn't a groupie.  She wasn't flirting with him.  She wasn't treating him like a rock star.   And I already gave the big speech to everyone else so I might as well give it to you too, Lenny continued, her blue eyes taking on a serious glint, Carl told me that there is to be no booze or babes allowed on board.   Luke felt a smirk beginning on his face and he tried to repress it.  He wanted to make a joke about how that meant she was already breaking the rules, but he figured she probably didn't place herself in the 'babes' category.   Don't make that face, Lenny took on a scolding tone.  I'll be around to inspect regularly and I have no problem being the bad guy.   You're really taking this job seriously, aren't you? Luke tried to keep his statement from sounding condescending.   Lenny arched an eyebrow at him as if she was expecting a challenge.   You have my full support, Luke tipped his head towards her and he thought he detected the hint of a blush starting low on her neck.  But maybe he was wrong about that too.   She gave a small, sideways smile that nearly melted Luke on the spot.  When she turned to leave the bus, he automatically followed her.   As they stepped down into the humid July evening, Lenny turned and pursed her lips.  She narrowed her eyes and Luke braced himself for what he thought was going to be an admonishment for him looking at her butt as they had exited the vehicle.  He thought he'd diverted his eyes before she'd noticed, but now he wasn't so sure.   What? Luke asked innocently.   Lenny sucked in a breath and hesitated before taking a step closer to him.  Luke reflexively inhaled her scent and hoped she didn't notice.  If she did, she didn't say.  She held his eyes for a beat.   I know I don't know the whole story about what happened with Mike. . .  she spoke slowly and Luke could tell she was trying to find the right words, but I really admire how you all are supporting his sobriety by keeping alcohol off the buses.   We're a family, and family's support each other, he explained simply.  It really was that simple and he was thankful that she had reminded him of that.  Of the real reason they were embarking on this possibly disaster-filled adventure once again.   I don't have parents or siblings or anything like that, Luke had no idea why he felt the compulsory need to spill his life secrets to her, he didn't even know her.  He could say it was something in her eyes that he trusted.  Or the way she turned her head slightly when she was listening to him that signaled his words were safe in the space that existed between them.  These guys are more than friends to me.  They are my family.   She reached up to touch her lips, like she wanted to ask a question but had to stop herself.  He was curious what she would ask; what direction her questions would take them in this impromptu albeit personal conversation.   Lenny's eyes drifted to something over his shoulder and Luke knew she was suddenly very far away.   Yeah, she agreed, her voice rough.  And then, as if realizing where she was, her eyes snapped back to his and she pulled the clipboard to her chest protectively.  Well, I'm pretty much done here for the day, she began to back away from him and forced a smile.  You better get some rest tonight, you have to be amazing tomorrow.   Luke gave her a nod as she departed quickly, heading for the hotel.  He wondered what had spooked her.  Maybe that was in his head, but it seemed like something was on her mind, and damn if he didn't want to follow her and ask her what it was.  He didn't understand the impulsive need he felt to keep talking to her.  Figure her out, let her figure him out.   Ah, hell, he muttered to himself.  Sticking his phone in his back pocket, he watched Lenny's blonde hair disappear through the entrance.  He thought about trying to catch up to her but he waited a few extra minutes to let her get ahead.  He didnt need to know where she was going.  Probably to her room.  He didnt need to know which room was hers.  He didnt need to think about her at all.  In fact, he should probably try to stay as far away from her as possible.  She worked for them now, and sleeping with her, while that would probably get her out of his head, wasnt a good idea.  Not to mention the fact that he'd be starting out the tour with the same bad decisions that had plagued him all during the last one.   Besides, she didnt seem like the kind of girl to crawl into bed with a rock star.  She was better than that.   And that's exactly why he wanted to explore that gorgeous chaos he could see behind her blue eyes.   Luke made it up back to the top floor without seeing Lenny again.  He quietly changed his clothes and headed to the hotel weight room.  Maybe an hour of intense sweating would help sort out his confused desires.   An hour accidentally turned into two.  Even though he kept repeating to himself to stop thinking about her, Lenny was all that filled his thoughts.  Where had she come from? What was her story? As he burned out his bodies reserves on another dropset, he realized he knew very little about this woman they had so readily invited into their lives.  That was going to have to change.           Lenny showered and dressed quickly, opting to skip pajamas and wear her jeans and grey V-neck tee to bed.  It would save time in the morning.  Sleeping fully clothed wasnt anything new for her anyway; it was practically a way of life living at higher elevations.  She combed her long, wet hair and twisted it into her standard braid.  Just as she was finishing brushing her teeth, she heard a knock at her hotel room door.   She crossed the room and looked through the peep hole.  It was Carl, pacing in the hallway.  She grimaced and unlocked the door to let him in.  As he entered, she could smell cigarette smoke mixed with his aftershave.   Hey, she greeted casually, Whats up?  Carl strode across the room without saying anything.  It was obvious from his behavior that he was looking for something.  He scowled at Lenny, surveying her appearance and that of the yet to be used bed.  The persistent frown on his face relaxed somewhat.   Whats going on, Carl? Lenny tried again, but she already knew the answer.   I wanted to check to see if you were alright, he lied.   No, you wanted to see if I was alone.  Lenny corrected and the corner of her mouth pulled up into a half-smile as she shook her head.  She crossed her arms and leaned against the closed door.   Carl gave up the act, Well, yeah.   I understand this whole scenario is new for you, but youre just gonna have to trust me.   I trust you, he took a breath; its those other hooligans I have a hard time with.   Carl, I appreciate the over protective father routine, but I can really take care of myself.  She gently tugged on his arm and led him to the door.  Get some sleep, big day tomorrow.  She opened the door and he walked into the hallway.  He turned to say something else and she interrupted, Goodnight, Carl.  Then closed the door.             Carl stood in the dimly lit, empty hallway for a moment and then started to the elevators.  He trusted Lenny, even more so now that she had basically thrown him out.  She was a strong, young woman, no nonsense, focused.  And she wasnt going to let anyone push her around.  He pressed the button and waited.  With a ding! the door opened.  Exhaling a relieved sigh, Carl entered the lift and leaned against the wall.  This tour might be successful yet.  The boys appeared to be more centered than ever, and with Lenny on the inside, Carl felt like he could relax a little.   When they had come to him months ago, asking for him to return as their tour manager, he had flat out refused.  However, he'd known most of them since they were tots and their persistence wore him down.  They made a lot of promises.  No drinking, no girls, no drugs.  And they refused to do the tour without him, so the label had offered him an obscene amount of money.   It had seemed that their hiatus had given the band the time and space they needed to figure out how to be musicians again.  They were dedicated to the creative process and claimed to have no interest in their previous. . . temptations.  Carl only halfway believed them.  He wasn't a complete idiot, they were terrific liars, that's why he needed an inside man, so to speak.   Carl had agreed to their request and then he started his own search.  He needed someone who the band would trust.  Someone seemingly innocent and innocuous.  Someone they would invite along if they were getting ready to trash the entire eighth floor of a swanky hotel.  But this someone would have to have loyalties to Carl, at least enough so he could try to stop whatever destruction the band had in its sights.  Because when it came down to it, Carl loved these guys like brothers.  Okay, maybe more like cousins.  He wanted to see them succeed, not crash and burn.   He was about to give up hope when Lenny had breezed into Jerry's office.  She was perfect.  Carl couldn't describe it; he had a feeling deep in his gut that this girl was the answer to his prayers.  Of course, that didn't mean he thought the next six months were going to be a prance in the park.  Carl had gone to Lenny's room to make sure she was keeping up her end of the bargain.  He was wonderfully relieved to find out that she was alone.  Extra point in her column.   The door opened to his floor and he strode more leisurely to his room.  As he got into bed and closed his eyes, he acknowledged the ridiculous feeling of excitement he was getting.  He hadnt felt this much anticipation for a tour since Double Blind Study was still a garage band.  It felt good.  Right.   Last nights show had gone perfect.  Playing poker until early morning with his oldest friends had been a welcome change from the infamously crazy after-parties of the last tour.  And no one had mentioned Lennys looks, or even her gender for that matter.  Maybe they didnt notice.  This might work after all.             Lenny was the first one awake.  She tucked her small travel duffel into the compartment on the crew bus and hurried across the street to the tiny coffee shop.  The wonderful aroma filled her nose and woke her up a little bit more.  She ordered enough coffees for the bus drivers, herself and Carl.  Shifting the large order into a more manageable hold, she headed back to the waiting buses.   She passed out the coffees to the thankful drivers and sidled up to Carl.  He glanced over at her, a bit surprised as she handed him his coffee.   Thanks, he muttered.   They stood side by side without looking at each other for a few moments.  Then Carl spoke again, Sorry about barging in last night.   Not a problem, she answered quietly.  But try to keep in mind, Im on your side.  She looked at him with a wry smile.   He chuckled softly and took a sip of his coffee, Its new, Ill have to get used to it.   The Chicago morning was beautiful.  Lenny admired the tall skyscrapers against the periwinkle sky.  She had missed traveling and the excitement of waking up in a new place with the city just waiting to be explored.  Her heart beat faster in anticipation of the upcoming touring schedule.  She had no idea how much free time for her would even be possible.  It didn't matter.  She'd find a way to make the most of it.   I was gonna have you ride with the crew for a couple of days but I changed my mind.  Carl gave her a sideways glance, I want you on the Red Bus with Sway, Harrison and Blake.   Any particular reason why? Lenny saw this as a good sign.  It meant Carl wasn't afraid of her being alone with the band members during the long hours on the road.  When he had laid out the rules yesterday, one of them was: No girls on the buses during travel.  Family and committed girlfriends could be the exception, but none of the guys were in a relationship.  Lenny had been concerned about the logistics of keeping an eye on them if she wasn't going to be around them without supervision anyway.  Carl's directive just changed that.   You're my eyes and ears, Carl shrugged.  We'll try to switch it up periodically, keep them on their toes.   You got it, boss.  Lenny nodded towards the hotel where the musicians were making a slow and bleary-eyed exit, Time to get to work.  She slammed back the rest of her scalding hot coffee, ignoring Carl's startled look.  Tossing her empty cup into a nearby trashcan, she headed for the approaching band members.   Lenny grabbed the suitcases from out of their hands and pushed them onto their respective buses.   Cmon, ladies! We have a long way to go! She directed with authority while she loaded their few bags.   Damn, new girl! Calm down! Blake protested sleepily.  Lenny only laughed and shoved him up the steps of his bus.   Your adoring public awaits.  Lenny dramatically ushered Mike and Luke onto their bus.  Even in the the early morning, Luke looked completely rested and relaxed.  Lenny held in a contented sigh as he gave her a heart-stopping grin at the foot of his bus.  He held her eyes for a second, like he wanted to say something, but he just shook his head and climbed up the stairs.   Lenny gave Carl an exaggerated salute before following Sway up the steps of the Red Bus.  He looked amused and impressed with her efforts and Lenny couldn't help but smile.  As far as new lives go, this one was shaping up quite nicely.             Lenny settled into her seat on the Red Bus.  She was a hard worker and she knew it.  Her effort and quick success had already won her the respect of the road crew within a day.  Even Carl seemed a bit less tense.  She was excited and relieved to be on the road.  This was new and different and she knew shed be good at it.  Just like everything else shed put her mind to.  And there was more than enough for her to do to keep her from thinking about all the things she was running from.  A short seven hour drive, stage set up, show, stage tear down, back on the bus, drive all night.  She could totally do this.   Carl actually trusted you with us? Blake teased from his reclining position on the couch.   Yeah, what about the 'No Babes' rule? Sway added from somewhere in the kitchenette area.   I don't count.  Lenny answered, not even looking up from her notebook.   What? Why don't you count? Blake pushed himself up on one elbow to look at her.  Are you a lesbian?  Lenny smirked and shook her head, No, I just don't sleep with rock stars.  It's a rule I have.   Screw that! Sway dropped on the sofa opening a can of soda, shoving Blake out of the way.  We're not rock stars, we're musicians.  He shook his head, obviously offended by her word choice.   Fine, I don't sleep with musicians then.  Lenny corrected, rolling her eyes.   So Carl thinks nothing will happen because you have this special rule? Sway asked, belligerence all over his face.   Is that all you think of me as, Sway? Lenny narrowed her eyes at him.  Just another conquest?  N-no, Sway stammered.   Then why is it every conversation I have with you ends up being about sex?  It's the only thing he thinks about.  Blake grinned at his friend who elbowed him hard in the ribs.   That's not true! Sway protested.  I have layers, I ain't all about sex.   Lenny tapped her pencil against her knee, contemplating his defensiveness.   Sway's having a hard time adjusting to the No Bob Tour.  Harrison had settled onto the floor and was already rummaging through the video game consoles.  He found the setup he was looking for and started plugging it all in.  He has to talk about it a lot before he can let it go.  It's his way.   Sway 'humphed' and settled deeper into the cushions of the couch.  Blake took a controller from Harrison and joined him on the floor and they began an epic battle involving robots and zombies.   I'm sorry. . .  No Bob tour? Lenny questioned.   Yeah.  No Booze or Babes.  Bob.  Harrison explained as his avatar decapitated a zombie.   Right, Lenny hid a smile and reopened her notebook.   The cabin was quiet save for the gory zombie deaths that were coming from the plasma TV.  Lenny went over her lists for what to do when they arrived at the next venue.  She knew she had it down, but she always double checked.  Being wrong was not her favorite thing.   I still don't get why you're the exception to the babes rule.  Sway broke into Lenny's thoughts.   Lenny looked up to see him staring at her intently.  His blue eyes were hooded and soft.  The blonde hair he usually kept pulled back hung forward and touched the stubble on his well-defined jaw.  Lenny understood a little more how the girls were so easily taken with him.  Five seconds of his direct eye contact and she felt caught, examined.  The seduction thing made a lot more sense suddenly.   Sway wet his full, perfect, bottom lip with his tongue as he waited for Lenny to give him an explanation.  She swallowed and he must've noticed her unease because his mouth crooked up slightly on one side.   For shit's sake, Sway! Blake interrupted by punching Sway in the thigh.   What? Sway exclaimed innocently.  He rubbed the place where Blake had hit him and winked at Lenny.   Lenny let out the breath she hadn't realized she was holding and looked back to her notebook.  She felt the heat creep up her neck in embarrassment.  Even as she tried to fight it off, she felt her ears go white-hot and she vaguely wondered if she was going to spontaneously combust on the spot.  That would only further Sway's ego she was sure.  She could see the headlines now: Girl explodes from seduction overload after extended eye contact with rock star.   Lenny is off limits! Blake was actually yelling.  He hadn't even paused in his grizzly zombie killing spree.  He glanced over his shoulder to look between Lenny and Sway.   I know that, Sway defended himself, She was turning me down left and right, I had to make sure I still had it.  He leaned back on the couch and put his hands behind his head.  And I do.  He smiled wickedly at Lenny.   Just ignore him.  Blake directed at Lenny.  He really can't help himself.   I really can't.  Sway shrugged, agreeing with the guitarist.  And I also can't let you believe that you don't fall into the babes category, because you totally do.   Lenny still hadn't spoken.  She was certain her face was a lovely shade of maroon.  She was having an internal argument on how she would handle this.  Acknowledging it seemed to be the best option.   Yep.  You caught me, she gave an embarrassed smile, I'm a just a dumb girl after all.   Sway's face fell and he leaned forward bracing his arms on his knees, That's not what I was saying at all.   Harrison and Blake had paused their game and turned around, concern evident on both their faces.   I was just having some fun, I didn't. . .   He's an idiot, Lenny, Blake threw a glare at Sway.  No one thinks you're a dumb girl.  We're really glad to have you here.   Seriously, Harrison's dark eyes were round and pleading, You have to ignore him.  He just likes a challenge.  He hits on me at least once a day.   Lenny smiled at Harrison.  He really was the most adorable guitar player she had ever met.   That's true, actually.  Sway added and Lenny laughed out loud then.  They seemed to relax a little.   Guys, it's fine.  Lenny was touched by their concern for her feelings but it wasn't necessary.  It's not like I've never been flirted with before.  It's just been. . . a long time is all.  I forgot what to do in that kind of a situation, she attempted to laugh it off even as the truth in her words burned her throat.   All three guys exchanged frowns.   What do you mean, 'it's been awhile?' Harrison seemed confused.   Lenny bit the inside of her cheek, unsure how much she felt comfortable revealing.  She liked these guys and all, but that didn't make them best friends by any means.  And this subject in particular made her feel more exposed than she had anticipated.   Yeah. . .  Blake showed disbelief.  You weren't in prison or something, were you?  No, Lenny said, forcing a wide smile.  No, nothing like that.  I've been busy for a couple years.  Haven't gotten out much.  She grit her teeth at the twinge of hurt in her voice.   They eyed her momentarily and decided not to push it.  She was relieved when Harrison and Blake went back to their violent game.   She stared out the window, enjoying the peacefulness of the prairie as it passed outside.  What a weird first day.             During stage setup, the band was sleeping and Lenny decided to learn as much as she could about the equipment.  She had never handled musical instruments before; she came from a family of devoted athletes.  She understood gym equipment and sports gear; weight plates, dumbbells, sparring helmets and gloves, various forms of physical protection and how to utilize all of those items to the maximum benefit of the user.  Guitars, drum kits, amplifiers, mic stands and the like were completely foreign to her.  But she was a fast learner and applied herself full force.   She made sure the band got to sound check and then she took her first official break of the day.  She changed into athletic shorts, a sports bra, and running shoes.  She texted Carl, telling him she would be back in two hours, and went for a run.   The fresh air helped clear her head.  The time went fast and she arrived back at the venue.  After a couple minutes of snooping around, she found a shower in the stadium and took advantage of it.  She dressed quickly in jeans and a blue tank top and went backstage to make sure everything was still on track.   Sam, head of security, greeted her first and pointed her towards Carl, in the sound booth with the technician.  Carl looked up and smiled when he saw her.  She raised her eyebrows in silent question; his smiles had been few and far between for the most part.   Its all good, he said happily, all according to plan.   Good.  Lenny shifted her gaze to the band warming up on stage.  They sound tight.  She looked at the sound tech, Would you mind if I sat in here with you during the show? I wont get in the way.   Fine with me, he replied.   Carl dismissed himself leaving Lenny and Greg, the sound engineer, alone.  Lenny paid attention to all the little switches and knobs, memorizing as much as she could without asking questions.  She didnt want to be a distraction.             Mike could see everything from his position behind the drums.  He watched Lenny walk back to the sound booth but, more importantly, he saw Luke staring at her.  His posture and playing changed noticeably.  It was like he was trying to show off a little.  Mike chuckled to himself, realizing Lukes crush.  He made a mental note to ask him about it later.   When sound check wrapped up, Mike took a long pull from his water bottle and followed the rest of the band back to the Blue Bus to chill before the show.   So, I noticed that someone has eyes for the new hottie, Mike casually remarked as they relaxed in the main lounge.   Who doesnt? Sway mumbled, rummaging through the fridge.   No shit, that chick is smokin.  Blake took a drink from his water.   Mike kept his focus on Luke who shifted uneasily on his feet, looking anywhere except at Mike.   I wasnt talking about you horn dogs, Mike replied.   They turned to Luke who still hadnt said anything.   You like Lenny, Luke? Leave it to Harrison to just be out with it.   Luke looked up, pretending to be confused, What? No, of course not.   So you hate her? Harrison was deliberately trapping him into a confession of some kind.   No, I dont hate her, dont be ridiculous.  Shes nice, Luke stammered, looking uncomfortable.   So you do like her.  Harrison wanted an absolution, his face the picture of innocence.   What do you want me to say? Luke was growing more agitated.  You want me to say I think shes good looking? She is.  You all think so, too.  Why does it matter if I say it?  Whoa, dude, relax, Blake dramatically widened his eyes and motioned with his hands for Luke to calm down, Were not the ones in love with her.   Luke rolled his eyes and stormed towards the door.  Youre a bunch of dicks, you know that? He left in a huff as the others burst into laughter.   Whats wrong with him? Sway asked Mike.   Ah, he thinks his crush is a big secret.  Mike shrugged nonchalantly.   Well, if Im not allowed to bag her, then I dont think Luke should be allowed to either.  Sway sat down on the floor.   You know youre a pig, right? Mike asked him in disgust.   A pig that gets more action than you.  Sway pointed out, not even offended.   I dont think we should be talking about who does or does not get to bag Lenny.  Blake interjected from the kitchenette.  I have a feeling she could kick all our asses.   How was it having Lenny on your bus today? Mike asked.  He had wondered what had possessed Carl to throw her into the dog pile like that on her first day.   She was cool.  Helped me kill some zombies.  Harrison responded, exchanging a look with Blake.   What was that? Mike asked pointing back and forth between them.  Did something happen?  Not exactly.  Harrison said slowly.   Blake sighed and ran his fingers through his short dark hair, Sway put the seduction on her.   Dammit, Sway! Mike chastised.   I handled it, Blake reproved.  I don't think it's going to be an issue.   Can't you ever let one go by? Mike asked in frustration.  He was so sick of Sway never growing up.  The endless parade of girls over the years was making it really hard for Mike to respect his band mate.   And then Mike said what he had said many times before, You have no self-control.   The remorse that washed over Sway's face was sincere and Mike flinched inwardly.  They both had things they struggled to master that had hurt those closest to them.   I know, Sway said softly.  I'm still sorry about-  I know.  I shouldn't have said that.  The tension in the cabin was thick and Mike regretted having such a strong reaction to Blake's revelation.  We're both trying to be better.             Luke decided to take a walk to clear his head.  He knew the guys were just giving him a hard time.  What he was really upset about was how much he had let it get to him.  Lenny was already a sensitive topic for him and he knew that could get him into trouble.   Girls had always been a weakness of his.  He liked women and they liked him.  He never spent enough time with one to really know what they were all about.  The longest relationship he had ever had, he was loaded for the entirety of it.  Thats probably why it had lasted as long as it did.   Why did Carl stick her on the bus with Sway today? It had pissed Luke off more than it should have.  Jealousy was a new feeling and he didn't like it.  It's not like she was his girl.  She worked for the band.  She was off limits.  Off.  Limits.   He shook his head, trying to focus his thoughts.  He couldnt have a relationship with Lenny.  That would be unprofessional.  And a disaster.  Carl would be pissed.  Luke smirked at that.  But, she was going to be around them a lot and she was really fun.   Friends.  They could be friends.  That would work, he had lots of friends, he knew what a friendship looked like.  He would just have to treat her like one of the guys.  And ignore the fact that she was his perfect height for kissing.  Shit.  This was going nowhere fast.   It suddenly occurred to Luke that he had no idea if Lenny even noticed him in that way.  She had remained cool and aloof towards him, and all the guys for that matter.  Maybe she wasnt attracted to him.  That was new.  Luke had never had to work for a girl to notice him.  Chicks constantly threw their bras and panties to him on stage, and once, Carl had had to chase out two girls who'd tried to stow away on the bus.  Maybe Lenny was exactly what she seemed: a hard worker who wasnt interested in getting tied down in a relationship.  Why did that make him want her more? Luke was starting to get mad at himself.   The real kicker for him wasn't his physical attraction towards her, though it didn't help matters.  Nope, that's not what had him confused and upside down.  It was the unpredicted avidity to crack open his chest cavity and show her everything.  Invite her to climb inside his mess of a life and add some beauty to it.   He turned back towards the bus; he knew the guys were going to continue giving him a hard time until they got bored with it.  He would just have to ride it out until then.  And hope he didn't screw everything up in the process.  They were depending on him.   Were you with your girlfriend? Blake lilted.   Go to hell.  Luke tried to play it casual.   Carl stuck his head in the bus, Ten minutes.   They started to the stage area, all of them feeling the energy of the crowd beating in their chests.  It reminded them all of why they were really there, the exhilaration of playing a live show.  They loved the fans and the excitement.  Theyd been playing together for so long it was nearly effortless.   When they took the stage, the arena went wild.  The time always seemed to pass too quickly.  From the first note to the last, they continuously gave it everything they had, knowing that they wouldnt be able to live their dreams without the fans making it possible.   They constantly left it all on the stage, returning to the buses completely exhausted.  All worry and speculation about any subject matter disappeared; they focused on rocking their fans' faces off.  And they never disappointed.        3    Best of You      meet me in the mountains  under a star filled sky  build me a fire out of ashes  teach me how to fly  -excerpt from Lenny's journal      Lenny hadn't slept in almost two years.  Not really.  She could lay down and stare at the dark and hope and pray to slip into peaceful oblivion, but it wouldn't happen.   She would have little bouts of sleep, but nothing solid to cling to, nothing that felt like the sleep she remembered from days long ago.  It would usually start with the muscle aches, followed by the vivid nightmare replay.  Some images never seemed to fade, especially with a photographic memory, and they were in perfect, crystal clear reception when she was alone in her bunk.  The traumatic betrayal that left her empty, the physical pain that ripped through her body as her dreams fell apart around her, the gruesome incompetence to stop or change any of the events as she watched them replay again and again.  The end always resulted with the perfunctory long-standing headache.   She was a pro at hiding the dark circles under her eyes with special concealer and acting like being a morning person was just who she was.  She knew that Carl believed that she took coffee intravenously, and she couldn't deny that it would make the consumption of required caffeine that much easier.   Her inability to sleep came in quite handy for her new job.  Everyone thought she was the first one awake.  Nope, she was just up.  All the time.   Lenny sighed as she paid for the hot, black beverage at the counter in the roadside diner.  Yep, another exhausting day.  At least Carl loved coffee as much as she did.  She smirked as as she grabbed his to-go cup.  If only he knew what a pusher she felt like every time she handed him his cup.             Trust.  Trust was a big deal to Carl.  It usually took years of knowing him to earn it.  Two weeks into the tour and Carl knew he trusted Lenny beyond the reasonable.   She didn't just do what was expected, she rose above expectation.  She inexplicably knew everything about everyone's station.  She could fill in at a moment's notice.  She was everywhere at once, solving problems before Carl knew they ever existed.  And she did all of it with a smile.   Professional barely covered it.  The entire tour ran on her timetable, which happened to be more efficient than Carl's.  He got more than an assistant out of hiring Lenny.  If Carl was the ruthless sea captain, then Lenny was his devoted first officer.  And the crew was loyal to her.  Probably to the death.   He was starting to wonder how he had done this for nearly twenty years without her.  Gone were the days of wild parties, coked out musicians, and random girls filing on and off the buses.  She kept the buses clean of any contraband and shooed groupies away.  Carl finally slept easily at night and as a pleasant result, his acid reflux was under control.   He knew he should give credit to the band for the lifestyle overhaul they'd promised from the beginning, but Carl chose to believe that none of this would be possible without Lenny.  She was his right hand.  If Carl was the Emperor, then Lenny was Darth Vader.   It was possible that the power was going to Carl's head.   He still didn't know what she had so readily left behind the day he hired her.  He kind of didn't care.  Whoever, or whatever, had chased her away was a fool, and he was reaping the benefits of that mistake.  All he had to do was keep her happy and his life was smooth sailing.   He rotated which bus she rode on daily, sometimes hourly.  However, he still preferred to have her ride the Crew bus overnights.  No reason to play with fire.   No complaints had been uttered.  The guys enjoyed having Lenny around, and Carl knew they didn't want to screw it up.  Having a woman of Lenny's character on the tour had softened things considerably, to the point where even the hardest of roadies watched their behavior around her.   Carl couldn't blame them, she had a charm and exuberance that was contagious.  He looked forward to her bringing coffee to him every morning.  He never made that part of her duties, but he believed she did it out of the kindness of her heart.   Thats where he was waiting when she came to him with a frown.   Whats up? Carl asked, trying not to sound concerned.   Lenny handed him his coffee and shook her head.  The new opening act is a bunch of dicks, she growled.   Carl laughed out loud; Lenny never talked negatively about anyone.  Even so, he knew what she meant.  A new band had opened up for them last night and would be traveling with them for a short leg of the tour, six shows altogether.  They were young, immature, and hard-headed.  They had their own set of rules that they lived by.  They thought they were punk rockers, but they seemed to care an awful lot about making sure they looked like punk rockers.   Just a week and theyll be outta your hair.  Carl said, taking a sip of his coffee.   I hope I can make it a week.  Lenny grunted.  If that skinny asshat hits on me one more time, Im gonna punch him in the neck. . . accidentally.    Carl choked on his coffee.  Lenny smirked at his sputtering.  When he recovered he cautioned, Just stay away from them.  The label wants them to get some exposure.  Theyll burn out soon enough.   What kind of a name is Juniper Highlights anyway? They think they're so tough.  I bet I could make em cry in under five minutes.  Lenny huffed under her breath and then shook off her bad mood.  We still gonna make good time with all the extra stops?  Carl pursed his lips, Yeah, for the most part.  He grimaced as he thought about the time being wasted on friggin' bathroom breaks.  That's the last time Sway buys tacos out of some guy's trunk.   Lenny tried to hide her smirk behind her cup but Carl caught it anyway.   I know, you think it's funny.   It is funny! Lenny grinned at him.  And it's really not Sway's fault.  I mean, that Hibachi looked clean to me.   Carl rolled his eyes.  Well then, no more Mexican food on the road.  We can't keep stopping every time he's gotta take a dump.   Gross, Carl, Lenny pretended to look disgusted.  He's just following the rules.  She raised her eyebrows at him and he said the rule out loud with her:  No number two on the bus.   That should've been the name of the tour.  Carl muttered under his breath.   Lenny chuckled at his orneriness.  Hey, day off tomorrow, whats the plan?  Carl considered before replying, I was thinking about giving you the day off, too.  He raised an eyebrow and gave her a knowing look.   You mean, tell everyone I have the day off and then sneak around to see if they try to get into any trouble? Lenny translated for him.   Yeah, pretty much.  Carl nodded.   Sounds like a good idea.  I think the guys are getting sick of me playing Mother Hen.  It might be better for me to lay low for a day.   Theyre not sick of you, they love you.  Everyone does.  Carl told her seriously.   Lenny avoided his stern look and gave him her now famous half-smirk, did her trademark move of slamming her coffee and got ready to get back to work.  Carl knew it was her exit strategy for when things started to get too personal for her.  She was really good at protecting herself, but he was getting to know her despite it.  She didn't really allow compliments for herself.  She'd get a flicker in her eye and immediately end the conversation.  Just like now.   Time to get back to work, Boss Man.  She strode to the end bus to start her rounds, her golden hair reflecting the rising sun and bouncing the color off the shiny chrome.  Carl took another sip of his coffee as he watched her depart.  Damn, but that girl knew how to find good coffee.   Hey! Carl called after her, Blue Bus today! She waved her hand at him over her shoulder in acknowledgment.             Lenny knocked on the Red Buss door and waited for a few seconds before boarding the bus.  She liked to give a small warning before entering because a couple of days ago she discovered how much Sway liked to walk around in the nude.  Growing up with three brothers it wasn't anything shocking for Lenny.  But Sway had actually been kind of embarrassed.  Which had been pretty adorable.   The guys were sitting in the main living space with guitars and papers spread all around them.  They looked up in unison as Lenny entered the room.   How you feeling, Sway? Lenny asked the bassist.   He rubbed his belly and made a sad face, Now that I've shit out half my intestines I feel a little better.   Nice.  Lenny shook her head.  Well, Carl says no more Mexican food on the road.   Agreed, Blake and Harrison replied as one.   You ready to hit the road? She asked as she inspected their refrigerator and bathroom supplies.   Who are you riding with today? Blake asked curiously.   Blue Bus today.  Hopefully it'll be less stinky.  She teased, waving her hand in front of her face.  Sway looked apologetic and Lenny grinned at him.  Don't feel bad, we've all been there.   Hey, whats the plan for the day off tomorrow? Harrison seemed hesitant to ask.  His large brown eyes looking anywhere but directly at Lenny.   Um, lets see, Lenny said, pretending to think about it.  A whole day off in Virginia BeachI think I might actually go to the beach.  She laughed at their silent faces.  What? Carl said I could have the day off, too.   Cool.  We were just talking abouthow you needed a day off.  Harrison quickly covered as Blake gave him a stern look.   Sure ya were.  Lenny smirked, I know, Ive been in your hair a lot.  You need a break, I get it.  She smiled at their protesting faces but didn't leave room for discussion.  Its cool, I totally understand.  Ill see you later, she waved as she left the bus.   Lennys next stop was the Blue Bus with Mike and Luke.  It was her favorite stop of the day, thats why she usually saved it for last.  And today was even better because she would be getting to stay.   Lenny tried to stifle the spark of excitement that was bouncing around in her belly.  She knocked and paused.  She hadn't had any indecent accidents on this bus like the other one but she decided that she really couldn't be too careful.  Besides, Luke Casey naked was not an image she really needed to have in her head forever.  Unfortunately.  That would make working for him that much harder.   Making her way into the living space she could see Mike sleeping on the sofa, looked like hed been there all night.  Empty water bottles and candy wrappers littered the floor.  Automatically, she started to pick up the garbage and throw it away.  Luke came out of the bathroom, having just showered, with a towel slung low on his hips.   Why is Mike sleeping on the couch? You guys have a fight? She quipped, refusing to look up, knowing she wouldnt be able to keep herself from staring at Lukes perfectly sculpted chest and abs.  Freaking Adonis.   Luke retreated to the back room to put clothes on.  When he reemerged he was wearing faded jeans and a black t-shirt, his hair still wet and messy from the shower.  He had started to grow some scruff on his face a few days ago and hadnt shaved it.  But it looked good on him.  Made him look older.  He stepped towards Lenny and took the now full trash bag from her hands to tie it closed.   He was watching a movie last night and decided to sleep out here, he explained in a hushed voice.  He was standing close to Lenny so that she could hear him and she could smell the fresh shampoo from his shower and his minty breath.  Suddenly, she was very aware of her coffee breath and took a step back.  She smiled casually, ignoring the flush she felt creeping up her neck, and opened the refrigerator to give it a quick scan.   What movie was it? She asked, surprised at the steadiness of her voice despite the pounding of her pulse.  The intensity with which her body consistently responded to Luke's presence was alarming, to say the least.   Rear Window with Jimmy Stewart.  His voice was close again, just over her shoulder, and she swallowed hard before turning around.   His crystal blue eyes scanned her face slowly.  He had successfully backed her into the corner of the kitchenette.  She licked her bottom lip nervously and saw his gaze drop to her mouth and stay there.   I love that movie, too.  Lenny reached for the trash bag, grazing his hand with her own as she slipped it from Lukes grasp.  He inhaled sharply and she stepped around him, quickly backing towards the door.   Ill make sure you guys get a refill of water before we take off.  She paused, trying to get her heart rate under control, I'm riding on this bus today so. . . I'll be right back.   Luke took a step toward her, What are you going to do tomorrow?  Maybe go to the beach with Tanya and the other merch girls, she lied, looking away from his penetrating gaze.   That sounds like fun Luke acted like there was more he wanted to say but couldn't think of it.   Yeahso Ill be right back.  She repeated, but this time she turned around, finally breaking the tension between them and walked down the steps.             Mike watched their interaction through slits in his eyes and held back the deep chuckle that wanted to escape.   That sounds like fun, Mike mocked softly from the couch.   Luke turned to him, clearly surprised that he was awake.  Youre an ass, he muttered to his friend on his way to the back of the bus.   Mike let the chuckle out now; he enjoyed giving his best friend a hard time.  Luke didn't really have crushes, so there was so much more material to be worked.  Luke had never had a hard time getting women.  He'd usually just give them a lip curl and a wink and they were suddenly topless.  To Mike, it was very interesting to see Luke struggle so much with basic conversation around a girl.   Maybe you can help put lotion on her back, he continued to tease.   Luke huffed and closed the door to the back lounge, leaving Mike on the couch laughing.             What's in the notebook? Mike asked with curiosity, nodding towards Lenny.  She looked up and Mike thought he detected a bit of panic on her face, but she quickly smoothed it out.   Just my journal, sort of, she muttered, closing it and tucking it back into her bag.   You don't have to put it away, I was just wondering, Mike reassured.   I was finished anyway, Lenny's dark blue eyes connected briefly with his and he gave her a small smile.   You writing the next Great American Novel? He kept it light, still trying to get a good bead on her.   Hardly.  She tucked a stay hair that had come out of her braid behind her ear.   She stood up and stretched her arms over her head.  These long hours on the bus sure do get my muscles all bunched up.   Yeah, you seem like you're pretty active.  The drive must about make you crazy.  Mike gauged her reaction to a personal assumption about herself.  If it bothered her, she didn't show it.   Getting to know the 'real' Lenny was Mike's new hobby.  She was an expert at deflection and ambiguity.  It didn't upset Mike or bring him any cause for worry.  To him, it was a new way to pass the time on the long drives.   It's not so bad.  Lenny answered with a sigh.  Besides, it's not every day I get the opportunity to travel with one of the world's greatest bands.   And there it was, deflecting his personal inquiry into a compliment about the band.  It was her MO.  If a question required a personal answer, she would stroke the ego of the inquisitor.  It was like a weird game of chess, with words and presumptions being the moving pieces.  Mike loved it.   Carl said you go running during sound check everyday, Luke joined them from the back lounge.  He'd been noticeably absent, Mike thought.  Usually wherever Lenny was, Luke was hanging around nearby.  But he'd kept his distance most of the day, which Mike didn't understand.  He clearly liked the girl.   Yeah, it's a habit I picked up a few years ago.  Lenny averted her eyes and sat back down.   I usually run in the mornings when we park.  You should join me sometime.  Luke's lead singer confidence was back to oozy goodness.   Lenny's eyes flashed to Luke's for a second and Mike was certain she almost blushed.  These two were so attracted to one another, and continued to fail at pretending as if they weren't, that it was almost comical to witness.   Unless you think you wouldn't be able to keep up.  Luke playfully provoked when Lenny didn't answer right away.   That's the least of my worries.  Lenny gave him a sideways smile.  I like to run alone, helps me think.   I promise not to talk, Luke pressed, You won't even notice I'm there.  Mike was beginning to wonder if they noticed he was even there.   If Mike's attempts at divulging Lenny's carefully concealed inner-self was like chess, then whatever it was that Lenny and Luke did was like fencing.  Fluid.  Graceful.  Advance.  Passata-soto.   Then why do you want me there? Do you need a bodyguard? Lenny's tone turned playful.  Opposition Parry.   Luke guffawed, Maybe.  Sometimes I get scared.  He winked at Mike.  There could be bears out there.  Forward Recovery.   Oh yeah, Mike verified, Luke picks up wild animals like nobody's business.  He wasn't sure if he was helping or even what he was helping with; Luke still hadn't made any declarations to him about his intentions with Lenny.   Lenny let out a small laugh and she pulled her legs up under herself in the chair, slipping off her shoes.   I guess it wouldn't hurt.  She gave Luke a serious scowl.  But I run with a purpose, it's not a fashion show for me.  I plan on looking ugly and unkempt.   Good, better to scare away the bears.  Flick.             Lenny wasn't sure when she had drifted off.  She remembered talking with Mike and Luke about the new song they had been trying out the past couple of shows.  Then they had lunch.  Sandwiches.   Mike decided to get Lenny involved in his favorite soap opera.  He had waved her over to the couch so she could have a better view of the show and she settled in between the two men.   The next thing she knew, she was laying in the middle of a field under a perfect bluebird sky.  She hadn't seen a sky this crystal clear in so long.  The wildflowers surrounding her smelled clean and masculine.  Masculine? Wait a minute, that's not right.  But it felt sooo right.  Lenny rolled onto her side and inhaled deeply.  Mmmmm, you smell like snowflakes.  She heard thunder in the distance, a storm must be coming.  She felt the ground rumble beneath her and her eyes flew open when she realized it wasn't thunder but a very deep, hearty chuckle.   A man's chuckle.   Lenny sat up so quickly her vision darkened.  She tried to focus on something, anything.  Mike was gone.  The TV was playing but on mute and the cabin was the golden colors of early evening.   Whoa, calm down, Len.  Luke's voice was gentle as he placed his warm hand on the center of her back to steady her.  His blonde, messy hair swung across his forehead, covering his eyes.   I'm sorry, I didn't know I fell asleep.  Lenny's neck was heating up and she used one hand to wipe the side of her face.  It was as bad as she feared.  Drool.   It's fine, you were obviously tired.  You work your freaking ass off; I think you've earned yourself a nap.  Luke's fingers had started to make small circles on her back, soothing her.  They worked their way up to her braid and tugged on the elastic, pulling it free.   I didn't mean to. . . um. . . drool.  Lenny was humiliated.  She moved to try to stand up but Luke put his other hand on her knee, stopping her.  The warmth from his touch seemed to melt her to the seat.   Really, Lenny, he said sincerely, making sure to have eye contact, You didn't do anything wrong.  You need to learn to take a break sometime.  His fingers were still working into her hair and untangling the tight twists of her braid.   Lenny gave him a tight smile, wishing she could believe what he was saying.  But what if Carl had walked in at that moment? How could she explain why her head had been in the lap of a rock star? She'd have been fired for sure.  No, she would have to be more careful.   And she really needed to stop whatever black magic Luke was doing to her hair.   Besides, who doesn't like being told they smell like snowflakes? Luke was trying not to smile but he was failing.   Lenny's eyes widened as she realized she had said that out loud! How else could she embarrass herself today?  I was dreaming, Lenny muttered, coolly moving Luke's hand off her knee and tensing to stand up again.  Luke's hand in her hair held her still.   Give me minute, his deep voice commanded.  His fingers found the knot in her muscles at the back of her neck and started a gentle, but firm, massage.  Lenny let out a small sigh as he worked the tension free.   Dreaming about me or snowflakes? Luke whispered low in her ear, causing goosebumps to raise on Lenny's arms.   Neither, Lenny muttered and she finally broke out of his spell and got up and crossed to the other side of the cabin, settling back in her chair.   Can I have my hair tie back? She asked, holding out her hand and disliking the breathless way her words had come out.   Luke's face was unreadable as he watched her.  No, he finally said, I've noticed you've been getting headaches and I'm worried that braid is adding undo pressure.   Lenny sat back at his statement.  It made sense.  Her headaches usually blossomed right at the base of her skull where the top of her braid began.  But she had no idea that he had been noticing those things about her.  Her goal had been to be as invisible and as unassuming as possible.  The last thing she wanted was attention.   And since I can't get you to take any regular kind of break, the least I can do is require you to let your hair down, he grinned at her, so to speak.   Luke's smile caused warmth to fill her appendages and she bit the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling back.   Besides, you wear that damn thing every day; it's time for a change.  He wrapped the hair tie around his wrist and gave her a serious look.  And anytime you need me to work on the tension you have building in your neck, you let me know.  He arched an eyebrow flirtatiously.   Sure thing, boss.  Lenny replied, seeing the slight tick in Luke's jaw when she said the word 'boss. ' He didn't like being reminded that they had a working relationship but one of them had to right the rocking ship.  He was getting too familiar and she had to keep him at a safer distance.   Lenny flipped her head over and shook out her hair, pulling the strands through her fingers and releasing any tangles.  She couldn't deny that it felt good to have it free.  Every follicle was rejoicing in triumph.  Silly follicles.   When she righted herself, she saw Luke staring at her with hazy eyes.  She knew what that look meant, she'd seen it before, on other men looking at other women.  She didn't understand why Luke was directing that kind of a look at her.  She knew she wasn't ugly but she wasn't anything beyond. . . ordinary.  She chose to ignore it and pulled out her cellphone to check for any messages.   A couple texts from Harrison in regards to Blake eating the last of his Crunch Berries, a dirty joke from Sway and an ETA from Carl.   We should be in Virginia Beach soon.  Lenny informed Luke, hoping the subject change would snap him back to reality.   You really going to the beach tomorrow? Luke asked, shifting into a casual slouch on the sofa.  The setting sun cast shadows in the cabin and darkened his face so she couldn't read his expression.   Yep, Lenny lied.  She hated that she had to lie.   You could come fishing with me and Mike, he offered slowly.   Lenny cleared her throat.  Honestly? She would much rather go fishing with Luke and Mike then have to play party to Carl's paranoia.  But that wasn't an option.  No, I think I better work on my tan.   I've just never seen you really talk to the merch girls; I didn't know you guys hung out.  Luke suspected something.  Probably not the truth, but he definitely thought she was up to something else.  Lenny could feel him studying her and her pulse quickened.   Just say what you want to say, Luke, Lenny replied in a low voice, Ask me the question that's really on your mind.  This was a dangerous game, even for Lenny.  If Luke guessed outright what she was doing. . . she would admit it.  And Carl would flip shit.   The cabin was quiet save for the hum of the wheels on the road.  Lenny thought about turning on the overhead light so she could read Luke's face.   Are you seeing someone on the road crew? His voice was dark and rough, as if the question was painful to ask.   Lenny felt a small smile play on her lips.  No,  she let let out a relieved sigh.  Nope, I'm as single as they come.   She connected his suspicions and had to admit that it did indeed look like she was sneaking off to meet a secret lover.  She almost laughed at the idea but Luke turned on the lights in the cabin and the serious look on his face sobered her instantly.   He returned to his seat but continued to study her.  She met his gaze without flinching.   Are you seeing Carl? He asked, his mouth flat.   Lenny's eyes widened and her eyebrows raised at Luke.  Seriously?  He didn't respond, watching her with that penetrating stare of his.  As if he could extract the truth from her by willing it from the depth of her soul.   No, Lenny shook her head, incredulous, I am not seeing Carl.  That would be. . .  She couldn't think of the correct word to finish with.  Absurd, creepy, wrong, insane, all came to mind.   That would be what? Luke demanded an end to her sentence.   Weird.  Lenny finally vocalized.  And very, very wrong.  She lifted her hair off of her now hot neck and pulled it over one shoulder.  Why would you even think that?  You seem really comfortable with him, Luke stated plainly.   Apparently Carl wasn't the only one Lenny was comfortable around.  She still couldn't wrap her head around the fact that she had been asleep in Luke's lap.  Her, the girl who can't sleep.  Drooling in Luke Casey's lap.  It was ludicrous.   I guess he reminds me of my brother, Scott.  Lenny said slowly.   The tense lines around Luke's mouth seemed to relax and the playfulness came back into his voice.  Then what's the real reason you won't come fishing tomorrow?  Oh, boy.  Lenny was about to spill.  She swallowed hard, lying to Luke left a bad taste in her mouth.   I can't tell you, she finally mustered out.  She wanted to smack her forehead with her palm.  Why was she so weak when it came to him?  The silence that followed was oppressive and Lenny thought she was actually going to choke.  And then Luke let her off the hook.   I can accept that, he dipped his head in truce.  You don't have to tell me everything, Lenny. . . just don't lie to me.   Can I ask you a question? Lenny took advantage of the familiarity that seemed to erupt between them without her permission.  It may have been her imagination, or possibly her ego, but she had the distinct impression that Luke was more open with her than he realized.   Always.  He answered without pause and she felt a tiny shiver race down her spine.   What changed in between this tour and the last one? She licked her bottom lip and tried to clarify quickly, I mean, I know that Mike was in rehab but it seems like this is really important to you.  To all of you, she looked at him with soft eyes, But especially you.   Luke let out a careful breath, That obvious, huh? He chuckled nervously and rubbed his hand down the side of his face.   Lenny was a little fearful she'd asked too personal of a question.  But she couldn't stop herself this time.  She wanted to know.  Her need to know more about Luke was sometimes overpowering, like now.  It overshadowed her sensible reasoning to keep a safe distance.  She wanted to see past the image that was projected to the public and know who he was at his core.   Why did he give her want to make exceptions to all the rules that she believed would keep her safe from defeat? Was it the way his mouth curved up slightly on one side, how his voice deepened when he talked about his friends, the way he seemed to have one more thing to say but never said it? All of the above.   It's hard to explain.  His eyebrows raised slightly and he focused on the center of the floor.  My parents died in a car accident when I was in fourth grade and my great aunt took me in.  I met Mike in sixth grade and we were pretty much inseparable after that.  My aunt died a week after I turned eighteen, leaving me a ton of money and no relatives.   His eyes returned to hers and she saw something deeper, more vivid, than Luke had ever revealed.   The band became my family.  I'd do anything for them.  But we got too big too fast and none of us were super responsible about what to do with that kind of popularity.  I was drinking, his eyes widened and he looked into his lap, a lot.  I didn't pay attention to what was happening to us.  The night we almost lost Mike, I realized how much I needed him.  They're my family, maybe not by blood, but that doesn't really matter.  They're my brothers.   You love them.  Lenny said it as a definitive statement, squeezed from her by the emotion she heard in his voice as he relayed his simple story.   Yes, he nodded.  More than anything.  He looked into her face and she couldn't help but see the burden he carried for his loved ones.  The inner conviction and loyalty that drove him.   The music is more than a hobby or something we happen to be good at.  It's who we are.  It's or heart-breath, our creed, our passion.  His blue eyes blazed around the edges.  That's why this tour is so important to me.  Because they're important to me.   Lenny's heart pounded at his words.  His intensity, his truth. . . it was exquisite.   She didn't get a chance to respond because Mike rejoined them at that moment.  He staggered from the back of the bus, his messy brown hair even more mussed.  He rubbed his sleepy eyes and looked back and forth between Luke and Lenny.   That's not where I left you.  He winked at Lenny and she felt her face flush as she remembered where she had awoken only a short time ago.   Mike chuckled at her discomfort and got a bottle of water out of the fridge.   Hey, throw me one of those, Luke called to him and Mike tossed a bottle his direction.   You joining us for movie's and popcorn tonight? Mike directed at Lenny.   I, uh, Lenny stammered.  She had no idea what she was going to be doing that night.  She hadn't discussed it with Carl.  But more than that, she was still reeling from the complex emotions that Luke had stirred in her.   When we park we're going over to the Red Bus, you're coming with us.  Mike held up his hand to stop her weak protest.  We're the ones who asked you to come on this crazy adventure, it would rude to ditch you.   Lenny sighed in mock disgust but she gave him a smile.  If you say so.   She locked eyes with Luke momentarily.  It was enough to cause her heart to stall.  He was beautiful.  And not only on the outside.             They arrived in Virginia Beach around eight that night, the buses parked and everyone disembarked.  It had been a long two weeks.  Crew and personnel scattered almost immediately.   They werent staying in hotels for a lot of the tour because they were trying to cut costs.  The band had to prove themselves as a big draw again.  They had decided to buy their own tour buses which helped keep the crew comfortable during their crazy, sometimes back-to-back performances.  The schedule they were on was hairy, but they were more than prepared for it.  The investment of the transportation and skipping hotel accommodations for the majority of the trip, had been an easy and efficient way of getting the label's backing for such a date-heavy tour.   The band would all go separate ways tomorrow for the day.  But for the night before, they all gathered in the Red Bus to go over music Sway was working on and watch movies.  Having Lenny tag along was a natural addition to their close knit family.   Mike could see her apprehension and decided to give her free rein of the remote control.  He understood the complex idea of an outsider trying to fit into a dynamic that was already tight and bonded.  It couldn't be easy.   Lenny smiled gratefully as Sway placed the popcorn bowl in her lap.  That was something concrete Mike had picked up on, Lenny liked to eat.   Blake was already popping more for everyone else.  Lenny started to flip through channels, pausing on ESPN sports network for a moment.  She casually glanced around, not noticing Mike lounging in the back, watching though half lidded eyes.  She turned her attention back to the sports update.   He watched as her body noticeably shifted closer to the screen.  Her eyes lit up while the channel showed images of snowboarders practicing in anticipation of the Winter X games coming up in a couple months.  Mike caught Lukes eye and raised his chin in Lennys direction.   Find anything good yet? Blake asked abruptly and she quickly changed the channel.   Not yet.  Lenny replied, scrolling through the list again.  She eventually settled on an old classic movie.  An American in Paris with Gene Kelly.  Mike was a sucker for old movies and it distracted him from asking Lenny about the snowboarding.   You don't really like this, do you? Blake made a face at Lenny.   Well, it's no Brigadoon. . .  Lenny smiled.   Brigadoon! Mike heard himself shout.  He knew he had just gotten more excited than his usual.  Everyone turned to stare at him.  You like Brigadoon too? He asked Lenny, getting up and moving onto the couch so he could be closer to her.   Holy crap, yes.  Lenny giggled.   You've got to be kidding me! Blake grumbled.  There's two of them?  I always wanted to be Cyd Charisse when I grew up, Lenny confessed.   Mike didn't know the last time he had been this happy.  He was the only one who ever got into the old movies, especially the musicals.  He saw Blake roll his eyes but ignored him.   I made my mom sign me up for ballroom dancing because I wanted to be the next Gene Kelly.   How did you end up becoming a drummer? She asked, her smile wide.   Turns out I have a great sense of rhythm but two left feet.  Mike grinned and took some of the popcorn she offered.   Mike and Lenny talked through the whole movie.  They raved over the actors and the characters and the plot line.  They exchanged quotes from their favorite classic movies, trying to best each other in a guessing game.  Mike knew they were driving the others crazy but he didn't care.  His chess game with Lenny had shifted into ping pong and she was volleying with equal give and take.   When did you get into the classics? Lenny asked.   I'm not sure, they were always a part of my life.  But I got reattached while I was in rehab.   Mike stated matter of fact.  He sensed the mood of the room shift.  He hated that.  Anytime his past drug use came up, everyone started using kid gloves.   Im sorry, Lennys eyes were apologetic.   Its not your fault, Mike stayed casual.  I have a problem; its something I have to be able to acknowledge.  Its what keeps me on track.   The room was quiet, Lenny looked into her lap.   Hey, dont feel bad.  He said smiling at her, trying to break the tension.  Im the one who screwed up.  Im thankful I didnt die and Im thankful I have these idiots to help hold me accountable.  He playfully shoved her shoulder.  When did you get into classic movies? He turned the question on her.   Lenny swallowed and tried to push past the awkwardness she clearly felt.  I saw My Fair Lady when I was eight.  I decided right then and there that no one would ever be as beautiful as Audrey Hepburn.   The air in the bus seemed to relax a little more and Mike asked her questions about her her childhood.  Now all the guys were paying close attention, this was the most Lenny had ever shared about herself.  She talked about growing up in Wyoming and having three older brothers.   Dang, three older brothers, that explains your competitive side.  Mike acknowledged.   Yeah, Lenny's face was open as she talked about her siblings.  They definitely taught me a lot.  I was sort of an accident.  Scott, David and Nathan were all really close together.  Scott was twelve when I was born.  David was eleven and Nathan was ten.   So you were the baby, essentially.   I guess you could say that, though they would never let me feel like it.  I wanted to keep up with them so bad and they were more than happy to let me tag along.  I think I was afforded a lot more opportunity than others would have been in a similar situation.  Lenny got a faraway look in her eyes and Mike could tell she was feeling a little home sick.   Do you get to talk to them very often? Mike asked gently.   Not as much as they would like, Lenny admitted.  Scott calls every day but mostly to lecture me on my priorities.   Do they know what youre doing now?  Yeah, but they just like to worry.  Lenny tried to wave it off but she obviously really missed her brothers.   What about your folks? Mike wanted to find out all he could before her walls went back up.   My folks are awesome, honestly.  Theyre really great people.  Theyre just having a hard time with me growing up.   Mike noticed Lenny space off a little in their conversation but instead of drawing her back in, he changed the channel.  The movie had ended a few minutes ago and he wanted to try an experiment.  He turned the station back to ESPN and the sports broadcasters were still talking about the Winter X games preparation.  Lenny zeroed right in on the screen.  Mike kept one eye on Lenny and one on the TV.   Her face was pinched and tight, like she was trying to not feel whatever it was she was feeling right now.  It morphed into obvious distress as they started to show a profile of a female snowboarder, Cody Carmichael.  She was talking excitedly about the upcoming games and the interviewer asked her about her Olympic gold medal from two years ago.  Lenny stood abruptly, yanking the remote away from Mike and switching off the TV.  Everyone looked up at her sudden movement and she stared directly into Mikes eyes.  He'd gone too far.   Checkmate.   I have to go.  She darted out of the bus.   What the hell? Sway asked, confused.   Mike exchanged glances with Luke who had been watching from across the room.  He put down his notebook and grabbed his hoodie.   Ill check on her.  He waved them off and bounded out of the bus.             She was lacing up her running shoes when Luke walked onto the bus.   Kinda late for a run, isnt it? He asked, trying to appear casual but his concern was showing through.   Nope, Lenny answered stoically.  Her demeanor was drastically different than it had been most of the day.  She was cold towards Luke, closed off.   Luke was glad he was wearing his sweatpants and tennis shoes; he followed her out the door and matched her pace.   You dont have to come, she snapped.   I know, Luke answered, not even breathing hard.   Lenny picked up her pace, pushing Luke to keep up.  She kept increasing speed until she was at a flat out run, turning corners and crossing streets with unbelievable fluidity.  They rounded a corner and came to a large city pond with a bike path that ran alongside of it.  Luke matched her step for step, breath for breath.  She was running on pure emotion now.   As they crested a small incline she ran out of breath and collapsed flat out in the grass staring up at the star filled sky.  Luke looked down at her for a beat and then he took a seat next to her.  He let her rest for a few minutes before speaking.   You can really run.   She snickered a little and sat up, still panting.  I told you that you didnt have to come, she reminded.  She pushed her sweaty hair off her face and readjusted her hasty ponytail.   Luke looked up into the sky and then turned his eyes on her.  His kept his voice soft as he asked, What happened?  He saw a thousand emotions debating across her face but she wouldn't give voice to any of them.   You know, I had to chase Mike once.  Luke began; he brought his knees up and rested his forearms across them.  Of course, he hopped a plane and went to L. A.  You were much easier to catch.  He leaned his shoulder into hers for a moment and looked into her face again.  What happened, Len?  Its nothing.  Lenny was building those walls again and Luke could feel her shutting him out.  He sighed and put his arm around her shoulders pulling her tight to his side.  Trying to keep her from shutting him out completely.   Okay.  I wont push.   At first Lenny stiffened at his sudden embrace but then relaxed and turned her face into his chest.   I shouldnt have taken off.  Theyre gonna want to know whats wrong with me.  Lennys voice was muffled by Lukes sweatshirt.   Theyll get over it.  Luke rubbed her back reassuringly.   Luke had never just held a woman before and he had been able to seize that opportunity twice today.  It felt really good to feel her softness against his side.  She smelled amazing, the heat from the run mixing with her subtle perfume.  He used both arms to pull her a little closer.  When she didn't resist he felt a strange satisfaction in that.   Why did Mike run? Lenny asked into the silence.   That's not fair.  Luke tenderly corrected.  I can't divulge my best friend's secrets without anything in return.   Lenny's hand fisted against his sweatshirt and he pressed his lips to the top of her head.   Luke? Lenny's voice came out small and slow.   Yeah?  How long did I sleep this afternoon?  Luke thought back to this afternoon when Lenny had snuggled into his side and eventually rested her head in his lap.  She had fallen asleep almost the instant he had touched her.   Four hours.  Luke answered honestly and he felt her tense beneath him.  Why do you ask?  Why didn't you wake me up? She asked, ignoring his question.   Because. . .  Luke didn't know how to answer that.  Not without sounding like a psycho.  Oh well.  . . . I wanted you to feel safe.  He tightened his grip around her, trying to drive that point home.   Lenny wrapped her arms around his middle and Luke closed his eyes in relief.   They sat together quietly for a long time before Lenny stood.  She had put the pieces back together of her crumbling wall and she was her regular, centered self again.   Luke realized that no matter how comfortable someone may seem being alone, they all needed someone every now and again.   You wanna go back? She asked.   Luke nodded and they began a slow jog back to the buses.  His head was spinning at having spent so much focused time with Lenny.  He had a peek into her world.  Even though she had shut him out again, Luke knew that he had been the one to lend her the strength to repair whatever had broken her tonight.   As they rounded the corner and the buses came into view, Lenny slowed her pace to walk to cool down.   Thanks for letting me hang out with you guys tonight.  She said quietly into the humid night air.   You can always hang with us, Len.  Youre a part of us now.  His sincerity made Lenny smile.  He would do anything to see that smile more often.   And thanks for, she gestured to the way they had come, all that.   Anytime.  He wanted to pull her into his arms.  He didn't want the night to be over.  He didn't want her to be alone anymore.   He walked her to the foot of the steps of the crew bus and he had an idea.  She might not go for it but then again  Hey, we have the extra space for a third person on the Blue Bus if you would like to move over there with me and Mike. . . permanently.   Lenny raised her eyes at his suggestion, Dont you think that would be a little inappropriate?  Why? Luke didnt understand.   Lenny let out a small laugh, Because Im a girl and you are, well, notorious rock stars.   Luke grimaced when he finally understood what she was implying.  But its not like that with you; youre like a sister to us.   Lenny took a deep breath, Ill ask Carl what he thinks.   Luke nodded his head, Fair enough.  He started to back away, Good night, Lenny.   Good night, Luke.   Luke turned around and scowled to himself.  Youre like a sister to us? Why would I say something so stupid? He most definitely did not view her as a sister.   He shook his head and climbed the stairs to the Red Bus to say good night to the fellas before turning in himself.  They had questions of course, but he deflected them the best he could, protecting Lennys vulnerability.   It felt good to protect her.  Normal.  Maybe he was too hellbent on rescuing people he cared about.  Maybe it was because there was nothing he could do to save his parents and so he was trying to make up for that by rescuing everyone else, whether they wanted it or not.  That was a depressing thought.   Or maybe he was falling in love with her.             Lennys mind refused to let her fall asleep.  Again.  Long after the crew had come back to the bus and had filled the bunks, she was still lying in the darkness.  Waiting for exhaustion to win out over her thoughts.  The lines were blurring between her job and her desire to be their friend.  Especially Luke.   She couldnt explain the irresistible pull she felt towards him.  She got along with the other guys really well, but Lukehe was special.  Every time they had eye contact it felt like she was getting electrocuted.  In a good way.   She sighed and rolled over to face the wall.  Why did he have to be so damn perfect? Tonight he hadnt even made a move; he had simply held her, without expectations.  That was new, especially considering his reputation.  Then that conversation earlier that exposed so much of his complicated loveliness. . .  and now he was asking her to move to his bus.  No way would Carl be okay with that.  It had to stop; she couldn't let it go any further.   It was protection for him just as much as it was for her.   An unexplainable tear made its way out of the corner of her eye and traveled down to the pillow.        4    Creatures (For A While)      I am the king of this castle! Blake shouted from the top of the bar.  He lifted his beer pitcher high in the air and the crowd cheered as he started to pour it down his throat, spilling frothy overflow onto the front of his shirt.   CHUG! CHUG! CHUG! The spectators shouted at his feet, pumping their fists in the air.   How the hell did this happen?! Carl snarled as he and Lenny tried to push through the mass of people to get to the inebriated guitarist.   I dont know, Carl! They lied to me! Lenny yelled back angrily.   The day had started very differently from where it was ending up.  Lenny had told the guys she was going to the beach with some of the merch booth girls.  But she didnt.   Carl had wanted her to follow the guys and make sure they didnt cause trouble and negative headlines.  Lenny thought he was being a touch too controlling but he was her boss, she didnt want to tell him that two weeks into her employment.   Besides, she really didnt think the guys would get into any trouble.  Theyd been on the road for a little while now and they had shown no interest in the former things that had tainted the atmosphere of their previous tour.  Lenny had to wonder if Carl was just being overly pessimistic or if there was some truth to his anxiety.   Luke and Mike went offshore fishing.  Easy enough.  All Carl had to do was follow them to the pier and wait in a small caf till they returned.   Sway, Harrison and Blake said they were going to a local water park.  Lenny suspected Carl had her follow those three because she was younger and would blend in easier with the youthful crowd.  She was thankful that she could wear her bathing suit and still get a tan, adding to her alibi of going to the beach.   The guys rented a private cabana but that didn't limit their social capacity.  It did, however, make it easier for Lenny to track them.   Sway had women all over him, constantly bringing him lemonade and reapplying sunscreen to him every ten minutes.  Harrison and Blake were much more active, they enjoyed the rides and were very affable with the fans that recognized them, signing autographs and posing for photos.  Lenny was impressed with their graciousness and humility.   Sometime in the late afternoon, Lenny lost them.  They left the water park early and Lenny got stuck in traffic.  This is exactly what Carl didnt want to happen.   Desperate, she called Harrison on his cell, thinking he was the most likely to tell her the truth.   Hey Lenny, hows the beach? He sounded nervous, that wasn't good.   We came back early, Tanya got a sunburn.  That would be an easy cover, Tanya was always sunburned.  Where are you guys? She tried to sound curious but not overly so.   Um, were headed to a movie downtown.  He didnt sound like himself and Lenny could hear Sway whispering something to him in the background.  I have to go, its about to start.  And he hung up.   Lenny had no choice but to believe them so she pointed the rental car in that direction.  But they werent downtown.  They went to the far west side.  To a biker bar.   About the same time Lenny figured out they werent at the theater, she saw a picture sent to her on Twitter of Blake having a drinking contest with the lead guitarist from their opening act, Juniper Highlights.   Cursing herself for being so nave and cursing them for lying, Lenny called Carl.  They each raced to the bar to attempt to stop what they both feared.  But by the time they got there, it was too late.  Blake had already crawled up on top of the bar.  And now he was waving his shirt over his head.   Lenny got to him first and shoved other patrons out of the way.  She grabbed him by his pant legs and shouted up at him, Blake! Please come down!  Pretty Lenny! He smiled at her happily, Cmere, Pretty Lenny.  He wriggled his hips to the beat and attempted what Lenny could only guess to be his best Coyote Ugly moves.  His words were slurred and he was weaving a little on the bar.  Out of the corner of her eye Lenny saw dozens of camera phones taking pictures.  The place was packed.   This was a nightmare.   She climbed up on the bar with him much to the pleasure of the crowd.  The air was now filled with cat calls and whistles.  Ignoring all the requests for her to take off her own shirt, Lenny grabbed Blake tightly by the shoulders and began to help him down off the bar into Carls waiting arms.  His skin had a fine sheen of sweat mixed with beer and Lenny's fingers had difficulty getting a decent grip on him.  She was forced to hold him close to her to keep from dropping him.  The stench turned her stomach and added to her already pissed off state.   As they helped him through the crowd, he stumbled, and Lenny and Carl had to hold him up on each side.  Sway and Harrison emerged from the mass of bodies and were met with angry glares from both Lenny and Carl.   Can we help? Harrison asked.   Pay your friends tab! Lenny bit out.  She ignored Harrison's wide eyes.  She felt her anger burning low in her belly and knew she was on the verge of losing her temper.   Blake, oblivious to Lenny's ire, started singing along with the music and tried to dance again but fell instead.  He sat down hard on the floor with his legs splayed out in front of him like a toddler.  He reached his arms up towards Lenny and gave her a sloppy grin.   Kiss me! He declared.  Kiss me now! And then he dissolved into uncontrolled giggles.   Lenny ground her teeth together, her heart beginning to hammer with barely controlled rage.  She and Carl helped him back into a standing position and maneuvered him through the door and into the parking lot.  Blake's arm was haphazardly pulling her hair as he tried to keep his own balance and Lenny grimaced.   Waiting outside were the punkers from Juniper Highlights, doubled over in laughter.  Lenny used all the self-control she had left to move past them and get Blake in the van before any media showed up.  But then, they started heckling.   Your mama had to come get ya, huh? The tall skinny one laughed.  Lenny's face was already flushed with exertion but she felt a new surge of heat bloom across her cheeks.   For some reason, Blake felt it necessary to defend himself; he pushed Lenny and Carl away and held up his fists, charging towards the mockers.  Ill kick your ass! He was threatening when he stumbled and fell backwards.  Lenny and Carl helped him up again.  The punkers were laughing even harder now.   Lenny shot a death glare in their direction but kept moving.  We just need to get out of here.  Lenny tried to focus on the task at hand.   Guess you cant hold you drink as well as you thought, huh, old man! More laughter.  Lenny literally bit her tongue and tasted blood.  She exchanged glances with Carl from behind Blake's shoulders and he shook his head at her.  He must've been reading her mind.   Theres nothing worse than a talent-less, washed up rock star who doesnt know when to quit!  That was the last straw.  Lenny'd had a long day.  She was beyond angry at this point.  Of all the mistakes she had made that day, letting some dick-less moron talk trash about someone she considered a friend would not be another one.   HEY! Lenny whirled on them, dropping Blake into Carls arms.  Blake Diedrich has more talent in one earlobe that you have in your entire piss poor excuse of a band!  Then she charged.  She was lunging, her vision completely red, when she felt two strong arms grab her by her waist and pull her back.  She pushed the arms away, clawing to get to the punkers.  She broke free and tore towards them once more.   Who do you think you are? Huh? Youre no one! She screamed as she rushed them.  She shoved the guy and he fell to the ground with a thud, her eyes blazed with fury as she cocked her left leg up to kick him in the chest.  Suddenly Sway's arms grabbed a tight hold of her again and lifted her up and backwards, retreating to the waiting van.   The frightened hecklers had fallen silent.  Sway handed Lenny over to Harrison who pulled her into the van and closed the door.  He got in the front passenger seat and Carl squealed the tires on the van as he whipped out of the parking lot.   Lenny was in the backseat breathing hard, blood boiling.  Her body trembling with the adrenaline surge.  Harrison tentatively touched her arm to calm her down but she jerked away.   Are you kidding me?! She yelled.  What the hell? She threw her head against the back of the seat and closed her eyes, angry tears pushing out from under her eyelids.   Im sorry, Lenny- Harrison began, his expression pale.   Dont! She snapped, pointing her finger at him.  She rubbed the wetness off her face and smelled the beer on her hands from carrying Blake.  She let out another growl and wiped her hands on her jeans.   Lenny, Sway leaned around the seat but Carl reached over and put his hand on his chest, signaling him to stop.   No one dared to speak the rest of the trip.  By the time they made it back to the buses, Blake was ready to throw up.  Lenny helped him to a patch of grass a few yards away and rubbed his back as he heaved.   Carl took Harrison and Sway inside the bus and proceeded to lecture them for their recklessness and irresponsibility.  Lenny would have laughed if she wouldn't have been so mad; he was treating them like teenagers.   She rubbed Blakes back as he clutched the earth, holding on for dear life.  As his body expelled the alcohol again and again, he began to cry.  Lenny didnt feel it appropriate or beneficial for her to say anything.   Im so sorry.  Blake sobbed over and over again.  Im sorry, Lenny. . .  p-pretty, pretty Lenny More heaving.   Luke and Mike came around the corner of the bus.  Lenny's heart caught slightly as she and Luke held eye contact.  She knew she was mirroring the frown on his face but she didn't know what to say.  He glanced up at the bus where she could still hear Carl yelling.   Suddenly, Carl came stomping down the stairs and huffed out into the darkness.  His lighter ignited his cigarette and then he paced around the parking lot like a caged animal, kicking rocks and randomly yelling.   Luke went up inside the bus and took his turn yelling at Sway and Harrison.  Lenny wasn't even surprised.  She knew how deeply Luke cared for his mates.   Mike slowly shuffled over and sat down near Blake with his back against a tree.   You never did know when to stop, Mike remarked pensively.  He let his head drop between his knees and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand.   Lenny could tell Mike was thinking about more than just tonights incident.  Her anger slowly dissipated and turned into compassion.  They had seen their share of success and failure.  They knew each other's ugly sides better than anyone.  How hard it must be to see someone you care about slip into old habits, long conquered.   She looked at Carl, still having a fit in the distance, and she understood his worries better.  She was wrong.  He wasnt being controlling, he was being realistic.   At least we got there before he went full college coed on us.  Lenny joked lightly.   Yeah? Wheres his shirt? Mike raised his eyebrows pointedly.   Lenny shrugged in mock confusion, making Mike laugh.   I think Im dying.  Blake moaned from the grass.   Youre not dying, dont be so dramatic.  Lenny rubbed his back as he hurled some more.  Youre gonna be hella sick tomorrow, though.  She added with a touch of sympathy in her voice.  Blake groaned in response.   How was the fishing? Lenny looked at Mike.   Good.  Mike's expression softened with the subject change.  Peaceful.   You do anything this exciting? She gestured to Blake.   Mike chuckled, Not in a long time.   Lenny motioned to Mike to help her get Blake, who had finally stopped vomiting, into a standing position.  They helped him up the steps and into the bus, pushing past the lecture in the front room.  Luke stopped yelling and assisted in getting Blake into his bunk.   Lenny set a garbage can next to him and propped pillows behind his back so he was lying on his side.  She took a seat on the floor and leaned against the opposite bunk.   Ill stay with him tonight in case we need to go to the hospital.  She was worried and annoyed at the same time.  She should have taken Carl more seriously.  How was she going to repair this?  Harrison and Sway felt badly, it was obvious.  They should feel bad.  They had broken their promise to Carl, they lied to Lenny and now Blake had to be watched to make sure he didn't die in his own vomit.   Mike nodded and headed for the door.  He grabbed Lukes arm, pulling him with, on the way out.   Luke stopped momentarily and touched Lennys shoulder.  You sure?  She nodded but couldn't look up at him.  She felt too responsible for all of this.   Luke paused just above her then he leaned down and kissed the top of her head.  Youre amazing, he whispered in her ear before he followed Mike out of the bus.   Lenny expelled the air in her lungs slowly.  Lukes sweet gesture had sent shivers through her.  She leaned her head back and stared at the ceiling.  The lines between professionalism and friendship were tangling.  But she was too tired to care at the moment.   She watched Blakes sleeping form, his mouth hanging open.  She was more upset that they had lied to her than she was about the drinking in general.  I'm the worst kind of hypocrite, she thought bitterly.  What kind of right did she have to be angry with them for lying when that's basically all she had done since she'd met them?  She should have kept a closer visual on them.  She hoped Carl wasnt going to fire her.  It would probably depend on what the media reported tomorrow.   Sway and Harrison hung their heads like ashamed puppies and went to bed without saying a word.  Lenny knew she had scared them with her outburst and part of her was satisfied.  She chuckled inwardly.  If Sway hadn't stopped her she would have given that little douche bag a good thrashing.  She hadnt let her anger get the better of her in a long time.  It felt kinda good to unleash the back country girl, she had missed her.     Mike sat on the couch across from Luke and contemplated how to address the growing concern he had for his band mate's feelings in regards to their new assistant.  He had thought it was a brief crush, but now he wasn't so sure.  Mike could see the attachment to her gaining strength and he didn't want to see his friend get hurt.  Either one of them.   What's going on with you and Lenny?  Luke's eyebrows drew together and his mouth ticked up on one side.  I'm not sure what you mean.  Can you be more specific?  Mike rolled his eyes.  Was he really trying to play coy about this? It was definitely not his usual.   C'mon, man.  Mike scratched the back of his head in frustration.  It's me.   Luke took a deep breathe and looked down at the floor.  He leaned forward, bracing his forearms on his knees and looked back up at Mike.  His face was serious and almost inquisitive.   He dropped his voice to just above a hush, like he was afraid someone would hear him.  You know all those things we sing about? Love, passion, truth, beauty, life. . . ?  Mike nodded, feeling his frown deepen.   Luke shook his head slightly, as if he didn't believe what he was about to say.  He rubbed his face aggressively with one hand and chuckled sardonically at himself.  When I look at Lenny. . . I feel like I finally know what those songs are talking about.  He pushed back in his chair and closed his eyes, Do I sound completely crazy?  Mike held back a smile and answered quietly, No, you don't sound crazy.             Lenny left the bus early while everyone was still sleeping.  She had a lot of time to think throughout the night as she watched over Blake.  She was still disappointed that they had lied to her, but this wasnt her first experience with a bunch of guys hell bent on getting messed up.  She had three older brothers, after all.  And that didn't even cover half the things she'd seen grown men do when testosterone got involved.   She went across the street to a local fast food restaurant and ordered copious amounts of greasy hash browns, breakfast sandwiches and coffee.  She had one of the employees help her transport her large order, promising him a free CD in return.   Carl was waiting in his usual spot for coffee.  It was a relief to Lenny because she wasnt sure how mad he was at her from the night before.  She handed him his coffee and waved him into the Red Bus where she deposited the rest of her bundle.  She thanked the employee for his help and gave him the CD.   Arent you the girl who tried to knock out Travis Cline last night? The kid asked, referring to the lead singer of Juniper Highlights that Lenny had attacked outside the bar.  The kid had stars in his eyes; he was acting like he had just met a celebrity.   Were you there? Lenny asked, eying him suspiciously.  He looked too young to have been at the bar.   Nah, my buddy sent me the video in my email.  He held up his phone and showed Lenny a grainy replay of her outburst and Sway throwing her into the back of the van.   She tried to feign indifference.  Its not what it looks like.   Cmon, that was awesome! The kid argued.  Carl gently grabbed the young mans elbow, unsuccessfully trying to hide his smirk.   Take your CD, kid.  Thanks for the help.  He turned him over to security at the bottom of the stairs to continue his exit.   I thought we should have a family meeting, she started to explain, ignoring what had just happened with the internet video as she unpacked her purchases on the table top.   Im not mad at you, Lenny.  Carl got her to look at him.   You have every right to be, Carl.  I let you down.   Carl gave a lopsided grin, No, actually, you didnt.  Lenny frowned at him and he continued.  I watched all the media coverage of last nights incident and no one has video of Blakes King of the Castle speech.  But there is video everywhere of a blonde bad-ass attempting to take out Travis Cline.   Lennys face fell, Oh, no.   Carl laughed, Its alright, Len.  You saved the day.  He laughed again at her horrified expression.  Im just glad Sway got to you before you could do any real damage and I had to bail you out of jail.   Lenny finally saw the humor in it and let out a small laugh herself.  Yeah, I woulda hurt him pretty bad.  What she didn't say, was that her reason for panic was two-fold.  If she was identified in that video it could cause even more trouble.  I'm sure the sponsors would love that kind of publicity.   They heard a groan from Blakes bunk, interrupting Lenny's thoughts and she went to help him up.   What the f-.  Blake was holding his head and trying to sit upright.   Cmon, your Majesty, Lenny helped him up and to bathroom.   When she heard the toilet flush she reminded, Make sure you wash your hands.  She was talking too loudly on purpose and Carl chuckled.   Blake staggered out of the small bathroom and Lenny led him to the booth of waiting food.  His face turned up at the smell and he tried to pull away.   No, no, no.  Lenny prodded, You have a show tonight and you need a healthy breakfast.  She unwrapped the hash browns for him and raised an expectant eyebrow.   Blake grimaced but surrendered and took a bite.  After a few more small tastes he started eating normally and even asked for some coffee.  Lenny sat next to him in the booth and put her hand on his back.  She ignored Carl's watchful eye.  If she expected these guys to be upfront with her from now on, she was going to have to let some of her own walls come down.   Carl texted Luke and Mike to join them and he pulled Sway and Harrison from their bunks, literally.  He was obviously still mad at them.  They all gathered around the food silently.  Carl let them eat for awhile before he spoke.   Last night was stupid.  His voice was calm but serious.  The only thing that saved your asses from a full blown media evisceration was this girl, right here, going all Chuck Norris on that idiot.  He pointed at Lenny and the guys snickered quietly.  Weve got a few more months before we can call it a day, you know what I mean? They all nodded.   The air was quiet and Lenny was again struck with compassion for the guys.  While she was mad that they lied to her and Blake had come dangerously close to alcohol poisoning, she understood how badly they needed to expel some energy.  They were rock stars after all.   Thanks, Len.  Blake gestured with his food and then looked down at the table.   Dont think youre off the hook with me, Lenny was stern, Im still angry with you.  She sighed, but I get it, more than you know.   Mikes brow furrowed at her slight confession and he exchanged a look with Luke who shrugged.  Lenny didn't feel the need to explain herself.  The time for that would come later.   Next time you feel the need to prove your manhood, come and see me first.  I have some alternatives that might interest you.  She slid out of the booth and started for the door.   Where you goin? Sway asked.   I smell like a bar floor, I have to shower.  You guys need to get your act together.  Just because last night was rough doesnt mean you can slack off at your show.  She almost cringed at how much she sounded like her father.             Lenny left the bus while Blake swallowed another sandwich nearly whole and wiped his lips.  That chick is a genius; this food is a miracle cure.  He belched loudly.   Shes a lot stronger than she looks.  Sway said, tearing into a sandwich himself.   Ive never seen anyone so pissed, Harrison agreed.   I wonder what she did before joining us, Sway mused.   Probably UFC, Harrison said, half-serious.   Regardless, this should be a good lesson for all of you, Carl interrupted gruffly.  Dont cross her.  She will mess you up.  They all nodded solemnly and he added, She was mad when we got there but she didnt Hulk-Out till she heard that asshat talking shit to Blake.  You all know Lenny to be level-headed and focused.  Turns out, her line is you.  Carl let his words settle over them before he excused himself.   The guys chewed quietly for a few minutes, thinking about what Carl had just said.   Blake cleared his throat, Um, Luke? He said hesitantly.   Yeah, buddy?  I dont remember a lot from last nightbut Im pretty sure I told your girlfriend to kiss me.   Light laughter erupted around the table.  Luke rolled his eyes.  Shes not my girl.   Not yet.  Mike replied quickly, causing more laughter.   Lets just drop that whole train of thought right now, okay? Luke was trying to look as serious as possible but the side of his mouth kept turning up.  Lenny is off limits to all of us, remember?  Why ya smiling? Harrison ribbed.   Go to hell.  Luke picked up his coffee and left his band mates laughing behind him.  He went outside and stood in the warm sunshine, trying to push their comments out of his mind.  He knew they were right; he couldnt stay away from Lenny.  He just didnt want them to talk about it so much.   He saw Lenny exit the crew bus, her bag slung over her shoulder.  She looked around, taking inventory of her surroundings, having negligible eye contact with Luke, and headed to the backstage area.  Luke barely hesitated, jogging to catch up with her.   Hey, he said falling in step beside her.  She flashed a quick smile but kept moving, clearly on business.   Scouting for a shower? He anticipated her destination.   I can usually sneak into one.  She grinned at him and he fought back the urge to hug her.   You can use our shower.  He volunteered, already knowing what she would say.   That would be a bad idea, she replied.  Besides, I like the adventure of finding one.  I feel like I earned my shower that way.   I just wanted to say thanks for all you did last night for Blake.  I know it couldnt have been fun watching over him all night.  Luke's words came out hurried and nervous.   It's not like I was going to sleep anyway.  She held up her coffee, Thank God for caffeine, am I right?  Luke shoved his hands in his pocket, trying to figure out how to ask why she had blamed herself for Blakes actions last night.  And why she had gone to such great lengths to protect him.   I know it wasnt my fault that Blake acted like a colossal moron last night, Lenny said as if reading Lukes thoughts.  I just know that if I woulda been there, it wouldnt have happened.   They rounded a corner and Lenny stopped to face Luke.  They had just enough privacy so that no one could hear them but not enough for anyone to think something else was going on between them.   What about the Street Fighter routine, whered that come from? Luke was genuinely curious.  He saw the video on the news this morning and couldnt help but wonder at this mysterious woman who had worked her way into their daily lives.   I told you I have three older brothers, right? Luke nodded.  Nathan is a MMA instructor and he thought I should have a basic knowledge for self-defense.  I just let my temper get the better of me last night.  Lenny shook her head with embarrassment.  I guess you were right, Im part of the family now.  I couldnt stand to hear someone ridicule one of my brothers.  I wanted to take him out.   Luke chuckled, wishing he could have been there to see it in person.   Now, I have to go find a shower and get this. . . ick off of me.  Lenny made a face as she glanced down at her messy clothes.  She pointed her coffee at him, Don't follow me, we can't have people talking.   Luke nodded and she gave him a half smile and turned down a darkened hallway.  He watched her until she was completely out of sight.  He knew she was right, but that didn't stop him from wanting to be around her all the time.  She was completely amazing.  And a little dangerous.  And he couldnt get enough.        5    Falling      Lenny took up her usual post in the sound booth with Greg, the sound engineer.  Her inability to do any laundry the last couple of weeks had left her with a ratty pair of jeans and a vintage Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirt she had stolen from her brother, Scott, years ago.  Her long blonde hair was in a loose mess around her shoulders due to Luke's 'request' that she not wear the braid anymore.  She hated to admit it, but her headaches had gotten substantially better.   She found herself on her feet, swaying her hips to the music and singing along with every song.  This band, their music, had always pulled deeply at her soul.  She found it difficult to keep up the depiction of stoic observation, like a good employee should, when they took the stage.  She could get lost in the words, the beat, the melody. . .  Something about Luke Casey's velvety voice had an energizing yet calming effect on her.  It filled her senses like the fresh pine blowing through the trees back home. . .   After the accident, she had found little to no comfort in those around her.  But Double Blind Study on her play-list made her feel like she wasn't alone.  Someone out there understood what she was going through.  Her friends only added to the pain she was going through and DBS became her safe place.  Now, here she was, on tour with them, eating with them, watching over them, taking care of them.  They would never know how much they had taken care of her over the past two years.  When she went into that interview weeks ago she never dreamed that she would end up here.   The crowd was insane.  Bodies jumping up and down and slam dancing without stop.  Crowd surfers kept popping up and making their way from one side of the pit to the other.  The band played three encore songs and the fans went wild.  Lenny smiled with satisfaction, knowing that last nights incident had just drawn a larger crowd.   The band had a small meet and greet after the show before they could get on the road.  They had limited the amount of after-show events because of time restrictions so this was a rare occurrence.  Less than ten people, a few radio winners and some friends of Carl's that had driven nearly ten hours from Hartford.   Lenny's eyes kept being drawn back to the threesome that had arrived with Carl's backstage passes.  The tall, dark-haired girl was lively and friendly, dragging the shorter brunette girl with her in happy exuberance.  The short girl seemed. . . detached.  She looked uncomfortable and politely irritated by her surroundings.  Like she had something far more important on her mind.  The lone guy in the trio chain smoked almost as much as Carl.   Lenny saw Sway zero in on Tall Girl and she made her way that direction to intercept.  Sway had barely said a word and the girl's happy face changed to annoyed in a second.  Lenny quickened her pace.  Sway was going to get slapped one of these days.  Why did he think he could hit on anyone?  You're feisty, I like it.  Sway's lip curled up and Lenny saw Tall Girl take on a more combative stance.   Hi, I'm Lenny.  Lenny stepped in between them and stuck out her hand.  You must be Carl's friends from Hartford.  Tall Girl shook her hand and turned her glare into a more pleasant expression again.   I'm E, she introduced herself.  I only met Carl today.  She pointed with her thumb over her shoulder at the guy looking too cool for school, David got the tickets.   Lenny, I was having a conversation.  Sway leaned over her shoulder and gave her a scolding look.  E's glare returned and Lenny's smile widened to an uncomfortable degree of fakery that hurt her cheeks.   Let's get you guys a drink.  She turned E and her friends towards the refreshments table.  When they had taken a few steps, she turned and grabbed Sway with two fistfuls of his shirt.   She's going to kill you, Sway, Lenny warned in all seriousness, You have to back off.   Take it easy, Sway's grin was adorably nave.  He really thought he could get anyone.  He brushed off Lenny's grip and headed after E again.  Lenny wanted to stop him but she also kind of wanted to see what was going to happen.   As the evening progressed and things began to wrap up, Lenny was amazed at E's restraint.  She would have clocked him by now.   Lenny found out that E was a personal trainer and they exchanged different tips and techniques.  Sway's jealousy was apparent.  E spoke to Lenny more than him and he started to get huffy.  When they were getting ready to leave, E gave her number to Lenny to keep in contact.  Lenny was excited; she didn't have many friends who she could talk with about fitness anymore.   Gimme her number, Lenny.  Sway begged like a toddler after they had returned to the bus.   No, Sway.  If she wanted you to have it, she would have given it to you.  Lenny staunchly refused.   Please, Lenny! Sway dropped to the floor of the bus in a pleading posture, I have to talk to her again.   Why this girl, Sway? Lenny raised an eyebrow at him.  You didn't even talk to the two slutties drooling all over you.  I almost had to hose them down.  What made this girl so important to you?  Sway pulled himself up off the floor and threw his body into a chair.  You wouldn't get it, he grumbled.   Lenny crossed her arms and waited.  He ran his hands through his long hair a few times and sighed heavily.   I met her in Spain awhile back.  She turned me down then too.   She didn't mention that, Lenny said thoughtfully.   She's the only girl to turn me down, he looked over at Lenny and rolled his eyes, Besides you.   So, you just want what you can't have? Lenny was disgusted.   No, she's. . . aww forget it.  Sway waived his hand at her dismissively, I'm going to get some sleep.  He trudged towards the back of the bus.   What was that about? Harrison asked as he handed Lenny a water bottle and sat down on the floor.   I'm not totally sure, Lenny frowned down at her water.   You wanna kill some zombies with me? Harrison asked hopefully.  It didn't matter how late a show went or long they'd all been awake, Harrison loved to play video games.   Might as well.  Lenny smiled and tousled his hair as she sank to the floor beside him.             The label heard that Travis Cline had tried to pick a fight with a girl at a bar in Virginia Beach and pulled Juniper Highlights off the tour the next morning.  They didnt have enough clout for the company to take that kind of a risk.  Lenny was pleased, it served them right.  But that meant Double Blind Study didnt have an opener.  Harrison suggested they use local bands at every venue, giving new talent a platform.  It was an instant hit, increasing the bands reputation for staying true to their humble beginnings.   Additional things had changed since that night.  The dynamic had shifted between Lenny and Carl.  She was going to have to get a lot closer to the guys to prevent what had happened in Virginia.  That meant distancing herself from Carl a little more and staying nights on the band's respective buses.   He appeared to understand her point of view and respected it.  He had asked her to walk a fine line and he seemed satisfied with how the situation was evolving.  He gave the guys a little more space, and only really saw Lenny when she brought him coffee in the mornings.   They were coming up on another day off and the anticipation was palpable.  The crew was looking forward to blowing off some steam, but the band wasnt sure what they were going to do yet.  Blakes foray into bar-top stripper had made them a little more wary of letting loose.   Maybe we should just practice, Mike suggested from his seat in the corner.   They were all riding in the Red Bus as the convoy traveled to their next venue.  Lenny had been surprised at how much time they actually spent together.  It was a lot.  She had assumed that bands got on each other's nerves and needed their space.  Or maybe that was just girls in high school.   Thats a pretty good idea, actually, Luke concurred with his friend.   Sway and Blake groaned in unison.  Harrison had no response except the occasional grunt as he decapitated a zombie.   I hate this game, Lenny said under her breath from beside him.   Lenny, you said you had ideas for how we could demonstrate our manhood, Blake stated flatly.  The guys chuckled and Lenny turned a wary eye over her shoulder.   Yeah she said noncommittally.   What can we do tomorrow to be men? Blake folded his hands in his lap.   Lenny smiled at his phrasing and bit her lip.  Im glad you asked, actually.  I already set something up for us tomorrow.  She turned around as her avatar died and Harrison let out a whimper.   All of us? Blake asked, one black eyebrow raised.   Yep.  Should be fun.  And dangerous enough to keep you out of trouble.  Lenny stood up and stretched her cramped legs.  Harrison needed a new hobby, this was going to wreck her knees.   The guys tried to persuade her to reveal her idea but she remained tight lipped.   Ive already cleared it with Carl-  You clear everything with Carl, Sway grumbled.  That guy is sooo boring.   Hes not that bad, Lenny defended, He has a job to do and I respect that, you should too.  She chuckled as Sway rolled his eyes at her.  You know, you guys arent always puppy dogs and ice cream either.   Im actually hurt that you would say that, Mike remarked as she plopped down on the sofa next to him and he threw an arm across her shoulders.  I strive to always act as puppy-like as possible.   She laughed and shoved his leg.  Ha ha ha, she said sarcastically but her smile was genuine.   Cmon, just tell us what the big plan is.  Harrisons eyes were round and dark with pretend innocence.  His mother mustve had a hard time trying to keep him honest, Lenny thought with amusement.   Nope, youll just have to trust me.  She crossed her arms over her chest and leaned back against the couch, signaling the argument was over.   The guys grumbled a little while more, a common occurrence as they started to wind down from their performance.  It wasn't too much longer and they crawled into their bunks one by one until only Luke and Lenny were still awake.  They continued to visit quietly but Lenny was very aware of the shift in mood after everyone had gone to bed.  It had predictably become more. . . intimate.   He could make her palms sweat with a look.  Not to mention the fact that whenever they were alone her body suddenly wanted to fall asleep.  It was like it knew that Luke had dark powers that could cause her body to relax and finally rest for unspecified amounts of time.  It wanted to curl up against him and lose all connection to reality.   She hated her body.  Traitor.   You should probably get some sleep, too, she reminded Luke.  His face fell slightly at her sudden subject change and she wished things didn't have to be so complex between them.   What about you? He asked with uncertainty.   What do you mean? Lenny felt her heart rate quicken.  Stop it! Calm down! She scolded it internally.   You don't sleep much. . . do you? Luke's gentle confrontation left her without an explanation.  She could lie to anyone.  Her parents, her brothers, her friends.  But not him.  It was way too hard and required too much cognitive function, which she was somehow lacking in his presence.   Not quite, she finally muttered.   Why not?  It was a simple question.  Lenny wished she had a simple answer.  What could she really say? Sure, they had gotten closer during their morning runs every day and Lenny considered him a friend.  He told her anything and everything about himself, becoming transparent and real.  But there was still so much he didn't know about her.  She could change that.  She could answer his question honestly and open up to him.  It was only fair.   Oh, boy.   I was in an. . . accident, a few years ago.  Lenny started slow, her hands beginning to tremble.  She hadn't talked about this with anyone in a very long time.  She clasped her hands in her lap and squeezed them together.   What kind of an accident? Luke's quiet voice prompted.   Lenny took a deep breath.  This sucked.  Where the hell was she supposed to start? If she told Luke everything then. . . then what? Then he'd know.   I used to snowboard, she said flatly, the words falling onto the floor of the bus with a thud.  There it was, in the open, her secret.  She raised her eyes to meet his confused expression.   Like, professionally? Luke sat up straighter in his chair and leaned forward.   Lenny blew air out of her mouth.  Why did he have to be so interested in her crappy past? How was she supposed to explain all of this without coming across like a dick? Yeah. . . I was an Olympic contender.  Shit.  Now she sounded arrogant.   Luke's eyebrows rose, That sounds like a big deal.   Lenny closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose.  Here comes the headache.  When did things stop being black and white? Where did all this gray shit come from?  Yeah, she declared more forcefully than she intended.  She dropped her hand back to her lap and tried again.  Yeah, it was a big deal.  Luke waited patiently for her to proceed and Lenny fought back the urge to jump out of the moving bus.   I come from a family of athletes.  We're all awesome.  Her sarcastic tone made Luke chuckle and she relaxed a little.  I started snowboarding when I was a little kid and decided that's what I wanted to do for. . .  she shrugged, Well, forever.   Lenny paused as the memories rushed in.  The purity of the excitement.  The adrenaline spike of a good run.  My best friend's uncle, Duke, was pro at the time and he took me under his wing.  Taught me everything he knew.  He was wild.  He encouraged us to be risky and find our own lines off the normal, protected ski routes.  She shook her head, reminiscing.  My parents were totally freaked out.  They wanted me to have regular lessons and train in a more controlled environment.  But thats the appeal of snowboarding, there are very few rules.  It has a freedom of expression that other sports are lacking.  I got better and started winning competitions.  My parents were upset at first that I wasn't pursuing a more 'traditional' sport but. . .  she smiled wistfully, They eventually got on board.   My first Olympics, two years ago. . . almost three now, I thought I was ready, her voice cracked and she tried to swallow the ache away, I wasn't.  I lost control and wrecked.   How bad? Luke finally asked after a few minutes of silence had passed.   Oh, you know, the usual head trauma, broken bones.  Stuff like that.  Lenny saw the distress on Luke's face and she felt stripped.  Raw.  When he looked at her, he saw her.  Crushed spirit and all.  And it terrified her.   I'm fine now.  I made a full recovery, completed all my therapy and I'm clear for launch, she laughed, trying to brush off the severity of her injuries, but it was obviously forced.   Luke frowned at her and cleared his throat, But you don't sleep.   Ah, Lenny waved carelessly It's just leftover side-effects from having your body crushed.  I sleep a little.  But then the muscle spasms and the anxiety take over and. . . you know what? Lenny cut herself off and shook her head with embarrassment, It's not a big deal.  It's totally fine.   It's not fine, Luke confronted.  He suddenly crossed to sit next to her on the couch.  He reached up, brushing the hair over her shoulder and touched the tense spot behind her neck, This.  This isn't fine.  His fingers began their magical movements, releasing the negative energy that seemed to pool in that area.  And you slept just fine in my arms, his voice, warm and rough, reminded very near her ear.   I guess. . .  Lenny sought an explanation, one she hadn't figured out yet.  I guess, you make me feel safe.  She thought she heard Luke sigh but she couldn't be sure.  She shouldn't have said that.  She shouldn't have said any of the things she had said to him tonight.  She was losing control of her faculties.  This only happened around him.   You are safe with me, Luke gently pulled her into his arms as he reclined on the sofa.  He tucked her body between his and the couch, keeping her head on his chest.  His fingers stayed on the back of her neck, slowly removing the ache, while his other hand pulled her arm across him, completing the embrace.   Lenny's body was flush against his and her heart hammered in her chest.  If one of the guys came back to the main lounge or if Carl caught them-  I don't want you to worry anymore, Luke broke into her thoughts.   I didn't say anything, Lenny defended.   I can feel you tensing up again, he tapped her neck with his fingertips, Just relax.  This isn't anything more than a friend helping out another friend.   Lenny fought the heaviness in her eyelids.  Friends.  Is this what it was like to have friends? She slowly traced the black swirl of ink that started on his forearm and disappeared under his shirt sleeve.  She inhaled his scent, a mixture of soap and spearmint, and sighed.   She couldnt let feelings develop for him.  It wouldnt be fair to him or her, for that matter.  After the tour was over they would go different ways.  She focused on the reason she got this job in the first place, to get away and start new.  He was a rock star, she was the assistant.  At best, they were friends, but it couldnt be more than that.  Besides, Luke Casey deserved someone better than a broken girl from nowhere.  It was her last thought before she slipped into peaceful unconsciousness.             When Luke woke up the next morning, Lenny was already gone.  The buses had stopped sometime around dawn but he wasnt sure when she had left.  He wasn't too surprised.  He knew he was pushing every boundary she had set up between them since the beginning.  But he couldn't help it, from the moment he had first met her, he couldn't resist her.  When he found out he could offer her the peace she had been lacking, he jumped at it.   He had tried to stay awake as long as possible, just enjoying the feel of her in his arms.  Her softness and warmth, it was a closeness he'd never experienced with anyone.  It was terrifying.  And perfect.   Luke tried to push the burning apprehension in his gut further downward.  He hoped she wouldn't feel weird around him today.  He wanted this to be a step forward, not back.   He joined the guys after his shower and they began to speculate what plans Lenny might have for them.  They discussed skydiving, water skiing or maybe even makeovers.   Id be down for a makeover.  Harrison looked at his hair in the reflection of the chrome on the side of the bus and primped a little, As long as I get to keep my hair.   Lenny pulled up in a rented van and they all piled in.  They chattered the whole time, trying to get Lenny to tell them where they were going.  She remained secretive for the whole forty minute drive out of town.  Then the van pulled onto a gravel road that wound up into the gorgeous Smokey Mountains.  She stopped at a ramshackle cabin with a saggy roof.   As the guys quietly piled out of the van, an older gentleman came out of the cabin and approached Lenny.  His hair was gray and thinning at the temples but he moved with the energy of a much younger man.  He was obviously fit and carried himself with a dignity that had been earned.   Lenny Evans, it really is you! He grabbed her in a hug.  I havent seen you sinceoh, its got to have been four or five years now.   The band looked on, silent.  They knew each other?  Last time you were here you had that friend of yours with you, whats her name? Cody? Did she come along this time? The old-timer looked around.   Lenny laughed and shook her head, Not this time, Dale.   Luke frowned as a stray memory tried to connect in his brain.  Cody? He knew that name from somewhere  Guys, Lenny addressed her group, This is Dale Larson, he owns this shop and hes agreed to set us up for the day.   For what? Harrison asked, surveying the surrounding mountains.   Mountain biking.  All day.  She said it like she had expected them to have it figured out already.   The guys were definitely surprised.  Maybe a little nervous but Lenny seemed confident that they were going to do just fine.  Dale set them up with bikes and helmets and various supplies like water and snacks.  He gave all of them different degrees of instruction but nothing really specific, then he turned them over to Lenny.   Whatever happens, keep your eyes on the lead dog, he rested his hand on Lennys shoulder, Thats this girl, right here.  Shes the best Ive ever seen on a trail and shell show you how its done.  With that, he bid them farewell and retreated back into his cabin.             Lenny wasted no time; she climbed onto her bike and headed down the road.  The guys had no choice but to follow.  She tried not to push them too hard at first.  She had extra energy she was trying to burn off and she didn't need to take it out on them.   Waking up in Luke's arms that morning had left her feeling a combination of unparalleled rejuvenation and bewilderment.  She had slowly peeled herself out of his embrace and promptly begun avoiding him and any conversation having to do with him.  She had no idea what was going to come of this new development in their friendship.  But she was pretty sure that they were dancing on the edge of the traditional definition of just friends.   Blake caught up to her first, Hate to bust your balls, but I think I know how to ride a bike.   Lenny grinned and ducked off the main road and onto a narrow trail heading uphill.  She kept glancing behind her to make sure she hadnt lost anyone.  She laughed to herself every time she heard one of them holler in surprise.  She pushed them to what she knew was their limit, but nothing too risky or dangerous.  As they continued their climb she heard grumblings in the back for a water break.  She knew there was a place that leveled off up ahead and she would let them rest when they reached it.   As the last member entered the clearing, Lenny took her helmet off and released her sweaty hair from its tight ponytail.  She smoothed it back and replaced the elastic.  Then she passed out sandwiches and water, making sure the guys stayed hydrated.   How much further? Harrison puffed.   You wanna head back? Lenny offered.   No, well keep going.  Luke answered; he was barely winded and grinning from ear to ear.  He patted Harrison on the back, The fresh air is good for you.   Its a good thing none of us are smokers, Sway joked.   Yeah, Carl would be dead by now, Blake laughed.   Lenny smiled at her band of tattooed misfits.  They had quickly become her favorite people in the whole world.   She finished her sandwich and walked over to a ledge overlooking the forest below.  Mike walked up next to her and whistled.   Thats an amazing view.   Lenny agreed.  Mike studied her expression quizzically and asked, What other extreme sports do you take part in?  Lenny took a deep breath of the mountain air and smiled.  She turned toward the group and answered, I hang out with rock stars.         Luke pulled his bike up next to Lennys and handed her her helmet.  Ready, Captain? He asked her, testing the waters of their friendship.  Not knowing if she regretted trusting him the night before with her secrets.   Ready.  She buckled the chin strap and smiled up at Luke.  If she was ashamed, she wasn't showing it.   Youre gorgeous, he blurted out, not really thinking.   You too, she teased back.  You seem to be doing pretty good on the trail, she complimented.   I like a challenge, Luke winked.   Lenny raised her eyebrows and mounted her bike, Well then, Ill race you to the top.  And she was off.   Luke shook his head and sped after her.  He had never met anyone with so much passion for everything they did.  He loved the way she never stopped going after something and how she managed to completely master something new.  He wanted to see how fast he could teach her guitar.  Besides, that would offer more opportunity for them to be alone together.  He tried to shake off the excited feeling he got when he thought about sitting with her, alone, just talking.   He thought about kissing her all the time.  Constantly.  But he wasn't about to make her uncomfortable.  It would be alright, he would be patient until she trusted him.  He was enjoying every minute they spent together anyway.  That included hanging with a bunch of people or talking late into the night on the bus.   Lenny beat him to the top and took off her helmet with a big smile.   Was that challenging enough for you?  Luke nodded, trying to catch his breath, Well done.   They had a few minutes alone as they waited for the rest of the group to catch up and Luke plunged ahead with his just-born idea.   You should ride on the Blue Bus with us after tomorrow night's show.  I want to try to teach you how to play.   Play what? Lennys brows frowned.   The guitar.  Luke answered like it was obvious.   Why do you want to teach me the guitar? Lennys frown deepened.   Youre good at everything you do.  Not just good, youre the best.  I wanna see how fast you learn it.   Lenny shrugged, I suppose its worth a shot.   And then maybe you can teach me something I dont know how to do.  He was trying to be subtle but he still wanted her to pick up on the undertone of his suggestion.   If she did, he would never know because the guys came huffing and puffing their way up the trail.   So its settled, youll ride with me and Mike after tomorrows show? He wanted her confirmation, knowing she wouldnt go back on her word.   You got it.  She smiled openly at him and then greeted the stragglers, Hello, Lovelies.  How do you feel?  Im not gonna lie, Len, I feel like a man.  Blake confessed and they all laughed out loud.  Good job, mama, he complimented her as he patted her back.   Lenny let them rest and enjoy the scenery for a while before turning them back down the hill.  The ride to the starting point was quiet and Lenny took it easy on them.  When they got back to the cabin, they thanked Dale for the loaned equipment and collapsed into the van.  They were all too exhausted to even think about going out later.  Which, Luke suspected, had been Lenny's plan all along.   Lenny took a longer drive through the mountains instead of driving straight back to the venue.  Most of the guys fell asleep right away and the radio played soft country music as she wound her way along the tight mountain highway.  Luke sat in the front seat with her and watched her face as she drove along carefully.   I miss the mountains.  She said it so quietly Luke would have missed it if he hadnt been looking at her.   Luke reached over and took her hand gently in his.  He didnt say anything and she didnt look at him.  He kept her hand in his, resting on the middle seat between them.  His thumb softly stroked the tops of her fingers.  When they pulled into the parking lot, she tugged her hand free of his grasp.   As she parked, she smiled apologetically at him.  He nodded at her in understanding.  He had no problem being the guy who brought her comfort on her own terms.   The guys all piled out groggily and onto their buses, thanking Lenny along the way.   Thanks, mama, Blake hugged her shoulders, You made me feel like a man and kicked my ass at the same time.             The sun was beginning to set, and there was some discussion of getting a pizza and turning in early.  Harrison placed a delivery order and gave Lenny the cash.  She walked to the gate of the parking lot to wait for the driver.  Famous rock stars couldnt just get their own pizza; she smiled to herself at the thought.  They were crazy famous to the whole world, to her they were her family.   She sat down on the curb and enjoyed the peaceful calm of the evening.  The sky was turning from blue to purple to red with highlights of gold and pink mixed in.  She breathed in the clean mountain air and felt the tension in her shoulders ease.  She marveled at the strange turn her life had taken in the last month.  She had planned on getting as far away from her previous life as possible and now she was feeling the weirdest tingle of homesickness.   She missed her family and the open skies of Wyoming.  Tomorrow was Davids birthday.  She knew they would probably have a big family dinner.  Scott and Nathan would be there, as well as Davids wife, Felicity, and their four little boys.  Lenny would be the only one absent.  She should call to wish him a happy birthday.  She pulled out her phone and looked at it.  She decided to send a text instead; if they were busy she didnt want to interrupt.   Sliding her phone back into her pocket, she was startled when Mike sat down next to her.   You shouldnt be out here, she jested, Someone might recognize you.   Mike made a humph noise.   They sat quietly together for a few minutes, listening to the sounds of the city below them.  Lenny leaned back on her arms and kicked her feet out in front of her.   I have a confession.  Mike looked down at his feet and stirred some loose gravel around with his shoe.   Lenny frowned and looked over at him but didn't say anything.   I overheard your conversation with Luke last night.   Lenny wrinkled her nose in response.   And I know that you and Luke, he cleared his throat, slept together on the couch.   We didn't- Lenny sat up and started to protest.   No, I know, Mike stopped her.  You actually slept, not the other thing.   Lenny swallowed and waited for him to continue.   I just wanted you to know that I haven't told anyone.  I know how weird Carl gets about our personal relationships and he doesn't need to know about this.   Well, it won't happen again so. . .  Lenny wasn't sure what to say.  Embarrassment was beginning to color her cheeks.   That's crazy, Lenny.  Mike finally looked up from the ground and she was surprised at his serious continence.  You work too frickin' hard to have to go without frickin' sleep.  If Luke makes you feel like you can relax then I think you should take advantage of it.   Mike, that's not exactly. . . professional.  Lenny felt a burning begin in the back of her eyes.   Mike rolled his eyes.  Would you let it go for a minute? I'm serious about this.  His voice held an edge that she had never heard him use before.  I know what it's like to run away from something you love because of. . . mistakes.  He licked his bottom lip, looked back at the ground and then back to Lenny.  Luke's more than a friend to me.  He's a brother.  He aided in my recovery like no one else.  If he can help you get through this last little bit of disrepair, then let him do it.   I just don't. . .  Lenny's throat was dry and her head spun.   I know, you're embarrassed.  You don't want to need help.  You think you can figure this out on your own.   Lenny's stomach twisted at Mike's words.  When he said out loud what she was thinking internally, it sounded selfish.  And weak.   I enjoy the whole 'Girl Power' thing as much as any dude but you have to be able to admit when you've taken it too far.   A large tear splashed onto Lenny's cheek as Mike continued.   Sleep is so important.  I can't stress that enough.  If Luke can help you regain that part of your physiology then let him.  I have a pretty solid theory that once you get back in the habit of sleeping regularly, you'll be able to face the rest of your recovery.   But, I've recovered completely, Lenny argued meekly.   Sure, physically, Mike nodded and reached towards her, touching her temple softly.  What about all the stuff still happening up here?  Lenny's vision blurred with tears.  Her heart thudded in her ribcage as her head spun, trying to figure out where all of Mike's insight had come from and how she had become so transparent.  Did she really appear to be this weepy, broken girl, lost and needing help from strangers?  Hey.  Mike's voice had lost its confrontation and his hand gently pulled her face up so he could look her in the eye.  No one knows.  And no one has to know unless you tell them.  He studied her face for a moment.  The only reason I overheard the whole thing is because figuring you out has become. . . an obsession for me.  He chuckled at his own words.  But after hearing the truth, it felt wrong for me to know without you giving me the permission to hold that knowledge. . . you know?  Lenny nodded but didn't reply.  Mike's hand dropped from her chin back to his lap.  His eyes tugged down on the sides, making him look older than usual.   You're a part of the band now, Lenny.  Whatever happens from here on out, you need to know that we consider you the sixth member.  And you're safe with us.  All of us.   Tears began to collect in Lenny's eyelashes and she reached up to rub them off her face.  Mike had brought out a tangle of emotions in her and she was ashamed at her reaction.  She had no words for a reply.  Just more tears.  She wiped at them angrily.   Mike put his arm around her shoulders and she leaned into him.  Listen, kid.  I get it, I really do.  He paused and rubbed her arm tenderly.  But you have to go back someday.  You cant give up your passions just because of a bad decision.  Believe me, what do you think this tour is all about?  But Im not like you, Mike, she softly reminded.  Youre awesome and Imnot.   Mike chuckled at her reasoning.  Were a lot more alike than you would think.  Youre basically the chick version of me.   Lenny sniffed away her tears and laughed.  She sat up straight as the pizza delivery guy pulled up at that moment and Lenny paid for the food.  As she and Mike walked back to the buses Lenny asked, What happens now?  Now? Whatever you want, mama.  Well follow your lead, just like always.  He winked and Lenny felt relieved.   Now Mike and Luke knew.  And it didn't seem so terrible anymore.   Luke.  Every feeling she had in regards to him caused conflict inside.  She wanted to be next to him all the time and yet she wanted to run away as fast as possible.  He could make her feel completely safe and completely exposed simultaneously.   As if Mike were reading her thoughts he said, Luke just wants to help you, you mean a lot to all of us.  Try not to freak out about it.  She looked over at Mike with a stunned expression and he chuckled at her.   Lenny considered his words for a moment, You guys really are best friends, arent you?  Mike nodded, Id do anything for him.  He saved my life.  Hes the only reason Im back on the road again.  Mike sucked air in through his nose and frowned, adding weight to his final words.  He doesnt give up on the people he loves.  I owe him more than I can ever repay.        6    Short Skirt/Long Jacket      Luke's breathing was labored.  His body hummed with adrenaline and he bent down hard against the guitar strings.  Sweat poured off his face and his longish bangs stuck to his forehead.  He stilled his mouth behind the microphone and looked out over the throbbing mass of people; his arm hovered over the overworked instrument.  He felt a mischievous grin spread across his face as the audience screamed for him to continue.  He heard the pulse of Mike on the kick drum behind him.  Sway had his back turned to the crowd and he waited for Luke's signal.  Harrison stood at rapt attention, a smile beaming across his expressive face as he surveyed the arena.  Blake stood solemnly in his zone, guitar half-cocked, a statue of rock and roll.   Luke laughed into the microphone and the crowd screamed louder.   What? He asked them, knowing the reply.  Oh, you want us to keep going?  The reaction was physical, and the energy coming off the crowd pushed against him.  He loved this moment.  Holding the crowd on the precipice of complete rock and roll ecstasy.   Luke nodded once to Sway and the band exploded in a flourish of lights, smoke, and sound.  The crowd erupted with them, filling the stadium with even more madness than a few minutes before.   Luke rode the high all way till the end of the show.  He was still buzzing as he bounded up the steps of the bus.  He flopped on the sofa as Mike threw him a bottle of water.   There's never enough.  He said to no one in particular.   Never enough what? Lenny settled next to him, handing him a towel to wipe off his sweaty face.  Luke smiled up at the ceiling.  How did she do that? Make him relax in an instant?  Never enough time.  Or music.  Or voice.  He took a long drink of the water and sighed.  I want to do this everyday for the rest of my life.   You and me both, Mike agreed and Luke reached his hand in the air to fist-bump his drummer.   Luke rolled his head to the side and took in Lenny's fresh appearance.  She was in some old jeans and a too big t-shirt, her bare feet tucked up underneath her in the corner of the couch.  He squinted to get a better look, yep, she was wearing eyeliner tonight.  That was new.  Made her eyes look even bluer, if that were possible.  Her cheeks were flushed a healthy pink and Luke couldn't resist grinning openly at her.  She gave a half-smile and looked away.  He knew he was staring but he didn't care.  She was too damn pretty to not look at.   Lenny had let him hold her again last night while she slept.  On the couch again, but he didn't mind.  He'd take what he could get.   Two consecutive nights of decent sleep and her complexion had brightened noticeably.  Not only that, but her smiles came easier.  And Luke loved to see that smile.   Is that my shirt? He gestured to the blue tee that was clearly too big for her.   Lenny scrunched up her nose.  Ha, probably.  I used to jack my brother's clothes all the time.  I haven't had time to wash anything and I didn't feel like being a dirty girl today.  She picked at the hem.  I just grabbed one from the back.  I hope that's okay.   It's fine.  It was more than fine, he loved that she was feeling comfortable around them enough to borrow their clothes.  And the fact that she had chosen his shirt, whether on purpose or not, gave him a small thrill.   He tore his gaze from her and righted himself.  If he didn't purpose to move on to the next task he'd stare at her all night.   He retrieved his old acoustic guitar from his bunk, the one he'd had since he was in middle school, and took a seat in a chair facing Lenny.  He began to explain the construction and shape of it, trying to be more conversational that clinical.  He told her about the history of the instrument and what had first inspired him to play.   But I read in Rolling Stone that you learned how to play guitar to pick up chicks.  Lenny raised an eyebrow.  What a tease.   Mike let out a large burst of laughter, That's right! I remember when you said that!  Luke frowned at the two of them.  Of course that's what I told Rolling Stone. . . they're freaking Rolling Stone Magazine.  He shook his head as if to disapprove of their misunderstanding.   Lenny's sudden giggle was unexpected and she tried to cover her mouth with her hand when they both looked at her with lifted eyebrows.  Luke couldn't help but notice the flush on her cheeks and the nervous way she bit her bottom lip when she looked at him.   Luke gave her a wink and continued on with his lesson.  He explained chords, notes and calluses while the overhead lights bounced tiny reflections off the guitar and the mirrored ceiling.   Mike, for his part, taught Lenny the basics of keeping a beat.  He gave her a set of drumsticks and demonstrated how to use her legs to smack out a rhythm.  She picked it up quickly and soon they were having an impromptu jam session.   As Luke watched Mike and Lenny try to trip each other up he was filled with more appreciation for his drummer than before.  Lenny was laughing easily and openly at this point and Luke knew it was due to the cozy atmosphere in the bus.  And Mike was responsible for a lot of that.   Mike caught Luke's eye and gave a slight nod.  He got up and kissed the top of Lenny's head, I have to go to bed or I'll be grumpy tomorrow.   Lenny let out a small groan of disappointment but it was halfhearted.  Her eyes flicked to Luke's briefly as she said goodnight to the drummer and Luke felt his stomach do a somersault.  He wondered when, if ever, she would stop affecting him with a single look.   Mike retired to his bunk and Luke crossed over to the sofa and placed the guitar across Lenny's knees.  She didn't resist as he guided her fingers to the correct positions, letting his hands linger too long on her soft skin.   Yikes, I can see why you have such thick calluses.  Lenny winced as she squeezed her fingers around the neck.   Youre tough; youll develop some of your own soon enough.  Luke could smell her shampoo and it took a fair amount of restraint for him to not lean over and bury his face in her hair.  He watched the delicate features of her face as she concentrated on her finger placement.  She was learning quickly, just like he had anticipated.   I like you in my shirt, he softly murmured in her ear.  Lenny stilled her motions.  She didnt look at him; instead, she readjusted the guitar on her lap and continued to focus.   It really brings out your eyes, he spoke slow, leaning closer to her.  He lightly brushed the hair off of her shoulder, exposing her neck.  He wondered if her skin tasted as sweet as it smelled.   Lenny sighed heavily and her shoulders fell.  She pushed the guitar back towards Luke and stood up.   Goodnight, Luke.   Luke quickly put the guitar down, stood up and grabbed her hand.  I dont understand.  Where are you going? His eyes searched her pained expression.   Im going to bed.  You should too.  Were both tired and I really dont think youre processing things rationally.  She tried to tug her hand out of his grasp but he held on.   Len, Im sorry, please dont go yet.  I got carried away; I just like being near you.   Lenny's face was guarded.  When the sexy lead singer of the hottest band in the world starts talking about your eyes, it gets pretty weird.   You think Im sexy? Luke tried to joke with her, hoping to get her to stay.  Nope.   Lenny made a face and yanked her hand away.  Were friends, Luke.  Dont wreck it just cause you're horny, she snapped.   She was hurt.  And offended.  Luke was desperate to make it right.  He wanted to kick himself for being too damn pushy.  He thought she was feeling what he had been feeling; he had read the whole situation wrong.  And now she was slipping away from him again.   He gently grabbed her by her shoulders and waited till she looked him in the eye.  Youre right, we are friends.  The last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable.  He brushed a piece of hair off her face.  I realize our situation is. . . complicated.  It's just. . .  he stumbled on his words.  Yourethis unstoppable force of nature and sometimesI let myself get carried away when Im around you.   Its fine, Lenny replied coolly.  Sway explained the rules to me: What happens on the bus, stays on the bus.  She pulled back and tried to give a small smile but she looked entirely too sad.  Old habits are hard to break. . . I get it.   Luke frowned down at her.  Sometimes I dont think you listen to a word I say.   I will give you credit, though, she continued, You rock stars sure have a way with words.  She started to back towards the bunk area.  Well just pretend that this didnt happen and then no one has to feel awkward.  She tugged at the hem of the shirt she was wearing.  Ill wash this and get it back to you.   You can keep it, he waived her words off and tried again.  What about you getting some sleep? Can't we still. . . ? He gestured to the couch where he had automatically planned on spending every night holding her until the tour ended.   I don't think that's a good idea anymore.  Lenny's eyes pulled down on the sides with a deeper sadness than Luke had seen before and he felt like he'd gotten kicked in the stomach.  I'll see you in the morning.  She turned and disappeared into the center of the bus.   Luke slumped back on the sofa, giving up.  Not having the strength or mental clarity to convince her she was wrong.  He hadn't been trying to take advantage of her, he'd simply gotten caught up in her presence.  Caught up in her smile, her laugh, her very being.  It had been a long time since a girl had made him feel this crazy.  And she had no idea.  Not even a clue.   He sat in the quiet of the cabin, listening to the hum of the wheels.  He picked softly on the guitar, and jotted notes on a sheet of paper hed been carrying in his back pocket.  If nothing else, this girl had inspired some of his best writing.   He rubbed the scruff on his face.  No one, ever, in his life had started a fire like this inside of him.  He thought about what might happen when the tour was over and his heart ached at the idea of her disappearing from his life.             Lenny lay in the bunk facing the wall with her arms crossed over her middle.  She felt like she was tearing apart her insides.  She wanted to go to Luke and crash into him.  Wrap her arms around him and not let go.  But it would ruin everything.  It would ruin him.  She would ruin him.   Every moment she spent with him was intense.  It was all she could do to keep her wits about her.  Walking away from him had required more mental fortitude than she could have foreseen.  If he would have kissed her. . .  She closed her eyes at the idea; that would have been the end of her.  She would have came apart completely and she doubted very heavily that she'd be able to survive that kind of a wreck.  Different worlds.  Different people.  Different futures.   She would stay away for a few days; they needed to clear their heads.  A little time apart and they would be feeling. . . differently.             Three days.  That's how long it had been since Lenny had left Luke standing in the cabin on the bus with a broken look on his perfect face.  For three days she had successfully avoided seeing him and talking to him.  Except for those ninety minutes where DBS took the stage.  Then she couldn't take her eyes off him.  Couldn't stop imagining what that kiss would have felt like had she let the moment continue.  Couldn't stop wanting him to make another attempt.   She rubbed her tired face with her fingertips and tried to suppress a yawn.  Three days since she'd slept.  Yep, it was back to that.  She looked at her empty coffee cup and wondered if a fifth refill would be a bad idea.  She looked around the small coffee shop, planning on waving down the attendant.   She froze when she saw Luke standing in the doorway.  Looking directly at her.  At first, she thought maybe she had been daydreaming about him so intensely that she had imagined him.  But no, he was as real as he'd ever been.  Tall, lean, and perfectly created like a work of art.  A sculpture come to life.  Her fantasy with living breath.   She was trapped.  She couldn't exit without causing a scene.  Of course he's going to come over here, she thought with barely controlled panic as he made his way towards her.  He settled into the vacant seat across from her, never breaking eye contact.   Hey, she said with a small, sideways smile.   Ive missed you, Luke responded and then winced at his own words.   Ive been busy.  This leg of the tour is prettyintense.  His eyes were bluer than normal today.  She felt her traitor of a heart speed up at his close proximity.   Luke visibly swallowed.  He was obviously trying to keep from spooking her again and she felt a stab of guilt.   Whats that? He nodded at her notebook.   Just some poemsstupid stuff, really.  Lenny closed the weathered book and laid her arms on top.   Can I see? Luke reached across the table, his fingers touching the edge of her hand and setting her on fire.  Lenny hesitated but released it to him stiffly.  How much was she supposed to deny him? She was already withholding the friendship she had promised wouldn't get awkward.  It wouldn't hurt to let him read some old ramblings of a shattered girl in recovery.   Lenny held her breath as he leafed through the pages.  She thought a few days apart would cool things off between them.  Logically, it should have.  She was wrong.  Whatever they felt for each other had gained strength.   These are really excellent, Lenny.  Luke was absorbed in the written words and Lenny was rethinking letting him read her most personal thoughts.  Sure, not every single one of them was about her in particular.  But she had never really shared them with anyone besides Scott.  And that was just because Scott was so damn bossy.   No, its just pointlessgirl stuff she trailed off, finding it difficult to have this conversation.   Luke looked up at her swiftly, Nothing about you is pointless.   Lenny licked her lips nervously.  Why did he make her feel like this? She wanted to run away.  She glanced at the door, planning her escape.   Please dont go.  Luke pleaded, reading her thoughts.  Her chest burned at his request.   I should get back, Carl wants me to She was trying to come up with a plausible lie.   Just then, her cell phone rang and she jumped.  She hurriedly pulled it out of her pocket and glanced at the call screen.  Speak of the devil, it was Carl.  She answered it, ignoring Lukes heavy sigh.   Hello?  Hey, have you seen Luke? He wont pick up my call.  Carl sounded irritated.   Yeah, hes right here She handed him the phone, thankful for the interruption.   Hello?What?Right now? Luke closed his eyes in frustration and brought a hand up to rub his forehead.  Yeah, okay.  Ill be right there.  He hung up the phone and handed it back to Lenny, You shouldnt have answered that.  Lukes demeanor had shifted dramatically.   What was it about? Lenny wasnt sure she wanted to know based on the clench in his jaw and the narrowing of his eyes at the center of the table.   Luke stood up and grabbed her hand pulling her to the door, not worrying about her reaction.  Just some garbage I have to deal with, he growled.   He tucked her notebook under his arm and pulled her down the street possessively.  Gone was the Luke who was trying too hard to not cross any lines.  Lenny was thrown off by the sudden alpha-male, take-charge Luke that was striding purposefully down the sidewalk.  She half-expected him to toss her over his shoulder if she didn't comply.  He didnt release the firm clasp on her hand until they were climbing up into his bus, more agitated than Lenny had ever seen him.   As Lennys eyes adjusted to the darkened inside of the lounge she made out the figure of someone sitting on the couch.  A tall, leggy, buxom brunette was filing her nails.  She had on a severely short skirt and a cleavage baring top.  Alarm bells started to go off in Lenny's head when she saw Carl standing a little ways away with his arms crossed.   Hey, baby, the boobilicious girl lilted when she saw Luke.  She smiled and showed too many teeth, reminding Lenny of the shark from Jaws.  Her stunning blue eyes were half-lidded, as if in a sleepy, sexy daze.   What are you doing here, Ashton? Luke got right to the point.   Shes our opener for the next month.  Carl said, not hiding his displeasure.  The label told me a few hours ago.   That doesnt answer why youre here.  Luke emphasized On my freaking bus!  Lenny was too stunned to say anything.  Luke never lost his temper.  Ever.  And he was beyond livid.  She felt like she shouldnt be here except that Luke had brought her.  She knew her eyes were wide but she was pretty sure no one was paying attention to her.   Aww, baby, I thought youd be happier to see me.  Ashton wasnt fazed by Luke's shouting or the angry glares focused on her.  Her full, pouty lips made it impossible to look away from her mouth while she spoke.  She went on to explain nonchalantly, My band is riding with Sway and them.  Im gonna bunk with you.  She winked.   Lenny almost threw up.  She had finally placed who the bimbo was.  Ashton James was a recording artist, which was the simple explanation.  The more detailed version included her being Lukes ex-girlfriend.  Their relationship had been very public and fans blamed her for a lot of the problems between the band members two years ago.  Including Mikes overdose and following hospitalization.  Modern day Yoko.   No, Luke said, deadly quiet, You can ride with the crew.   Ew.  Ashton rolled her eyes and pushed her flawless, chocolate hair back over her bare shoulder on one side.  Carl already said it was okay.  She didn't even pause her filing and looked at Luke.  Itll be just like old times.   I never said it was okay, Carl was trying not to rage.  You backed me into a corner, you she-devil.  He turned to explain to Luke who hadnt stopped glowering at Ashton.  Her entourage filled the empty spaces of the crew buses and the Red Bus.  Your bus is the only one with room until we get to Denver, then the label will have one for her.   Whos the groupie? Ashton suddenly narrowed her eyes at Lenny and Lenny immediately felt her body shift into a defensive stance.   Shes their assistant.  Carl answered automatically, still caught up in his own frustrations.   Lenny felt her face start to redden as Ashton looked her up and down with a knowing smirk.  She didn't even know this girl and she already hated her.   So you guys finally hired a professional to keep you happy? The groupies too inexperienced for you now? Ashton ran her tongue over her teeth and arched an eyebrow.   Are you implying that I'm a whore? Lenny bristled, causing Luke to take a step in between the two women.   No, I was calling you one outright.  Ashton's eyes flared slightly, daring Lenny to react.  You're not?  Lenny is our personal assistant.  Everyone looked up to see Mike standing calmly in the doorway to the back lounge.   Ashton rolled her eyes and looked back to her nails.   Lenny, Mike addressed without taking his glare off Ashton, You dont do anything she says.  He took a few steps across the room and stood in front of Lenny with his back to Ashton.  I moved your things for you from the crew bus when I heard Lucifer was joining the tour, youre staying with us.  Permanently.   I knew it, you're all addicted to blondes.  I hope she's at least clean.  You had her tested, right? Ashtons voice dripped with disdain.   Mike grabbed Lennys shoulders to stop her from charging forward.  His jaw clenched visibly and he pushed Lenny towards the door.  He looked over his shoulder at Luke who was visibly shaking with anger.  Sound check, man.  Luke nodded but didnt respond.   When they got out into the parking lot, Lenny yelled to expel her frustration, WhatTheHell?! She had never hated anyone instantly before.   A few seconds later Carl stormed off the bus grumbling, Never hit a woman! Never hit a woman! Guess Lenny wasn't the only one with self-control issues at the moment.   Mike kept walking; he motioned for Lenny to join him.  She got close enough and he hooked an arm around her neck, pulling her towards the stage area.   Don't let her get under your skin.  His jaw was working furiously but his voice stayed even.  She's gonna say and do all she can to make you want to. . . well, kill yourself.  He snorted and shook his head.  No one knows better than me how effectively she can get into your head.  Just don't listen to anything she says, okay?  Lenny was mad.  She was mad because Ashton James shouldn't be anyone to fear.  She was mad because this person had hurt Mike in the past.  And she was mad that Luke was alone with her.   What about the rule? She can't stay on the bus.  Lenny was grasping and she knew it.   I agree.  If I can't have heroin on the bus than the devil sure as hell shouldn't be allowed either.             Luke took a deep breath and tried to calm the adrenaline coursing through his body.  He paced back and forth across the floor and rubbed the back of his head with his palm.   Whats wrong with you? Ashton asked, focused again on her nails.   Luke stared at her for a minute, not really believing she was back in his life.  Just when things with Lenny wereWere what? I mean really, whats going on with Lenny anyway? Every time I try to make a move of any kind she runs away.  Luke shook his head, trying to focus on the present problem sitting in his view.   You look good.  Ashton eyed him seductively, attempting to change the subject.   He heaved out his breath and sat down in a chair across from her.   Ashton, look, he began calmly; theyd had this conversation many times.  Please try to listen to what Im saying.  She raised her eyebrow and gave him a bored expression.   This tour is different; there will be no like old times.  At all.  He tried to decipher her blank look.  No drugs, no sex, no wild parties.  You understand?  Ashton squinted her eyes as she tried to decide which part to argue with and made a face.  Ugh, youre boring.  She flipped her nail file onto the table and crossed her legs.  Any other rules, Headmaster?  That was the thing with Ashton, when they were alone together she could almost be reasoned with.  If he approached it right.   Lenny is our personal assistant, you cant talk to her like that.  She deserves respect and she's going to get it.   Ashton leaned forward, her eyes glinting with mischief, Why, is she your girlfriend?  No.  Luke knew that Ashtons jealousy could take a nasty turn if she found out he had actual feelings for Lenny.  It would be so much worse than if Ashton believed they were only sleeping together.   Then why do you care how I talk to her? Ashton's lip curled in a disbelieving smirk.   Shell kick your ass, Ashton.  Luke answered honestly.  And if you don't tone down the attitude, I'm pretty sure no one will stop her.   Aww, you're worried about me? Ashton sat back and pouted like a child.  Lukes stomach churned.  He couldnt believe he had been with her for so long.  He had definitely underestimated how wasted he had kept himself two years ago.   Not exactly, Luke grumbled.             Luke was late to sound check and completely distracted.  But he promised the guys he would be on for the show.  Lenny fidgeted nervously in the sound booth, waiting for Ashton to grace the audience with her presence.  She hadnt talked to Luke since leaving him on the bus with her.  What could she say? Hey, your ex is a piece of work, mind if I smother her in her sleep? Yeah, that's all she could come up with.   The lights dimmed and the band started playing a slow ballad.  Ashton appeared in the spotlight.  Her body seemed to be completely proportionate and Lenny had to wonder how much of that was credit to an experienced surgeon on the west coast.  She worked the crowd over and brought them to their feet.  By the time her set was done, even Lenny was clapping.  That tramp could really sing.  It was completely unfair.   When it was Double Blind Studys turn to take the stage, they were delayed.  Lenny started to chew on her fingernails, wondering what was going on backstage.  Greg muttered something into his radio, someone muttered back.  He cued the lights and Mike struck the first beat of a very shaky performance.  They got stronger as they continued but it wasnt great.  Lenny was nervous for them.  The guys seemed disconnected from each other.  This had never happened before.  At least, not on this tour.   During the encore, Lenny decided to make her way back to the bus.  Her footsteps were heavy as she climbed inside.  Ashton, not unexpectedly, was sitting in the lounge reading a Cosmo magazine.  Her dark hair hung perfectly down her back, not a strand out of place.  Her long, fabulous legs stretched out on the couch in front of her.  She was wearing a mens t-shirt and lacy panties.  That was all.   Lenny rolled her eyes and walked past her.   Youre not special.  Ashtons dig was unexpected and Lenny halted in her tracks.   She knew from Mike's warning that she should keep walking but she wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  She faced Ashton, taking in her full lips and high cheekbones.  Not one thing about this woman was even remotely flawed; and again, Lenny wondered how much of it had been paid for.  Her eyelashes were even thick enough that Lenny guessed she probably didn't have to wear much makeup at all.   You think they care about you and theyll fight for you.  Ashton turned her wicked blue eyes to Lenny.  But they wont.   I dont need anyone to fight for me.  Lenny declared, knowing she was letting Ashton do exactly what Mike had warned her she would do.   Ashton laughed mockingly, Youre so clueless.  You really think you matter to them, it's actually kind of sweet.  She closed her magazine and set it aside.  But you don't have anything to offer they can't get somewhere else.  You're a simple novelty, a shiny new toy.  You're replaceable.   Lenny took a step towards her but Luke and Mike came inside at that moment.  Ashton jumped up and wrapped her arms around Lukes neck, giving Lenny a great view of her perfect ass.  Luke had eye contact with Lenny over Ashton's shoulder.  Lenny rolled her eyes in disgust and went to the back lounge.  Mike followed close behind.   I didnt have any clean pajamas so I borrowed one of your shirts, I hope thats okay.  Ashtons sing-song voice could be heard throughout the cabin.  It made Lenny want to rip her ears off and throw them out the window.  I mean, I always used to wear your shirts to bed before Lenny gave Mike a look and pretended to stab herself and bleed out.  Mike stifled his laughter.   Luke stuck his head the doorway, What are you guys doing?  Probably watch a movie.  Out there seemed a little, I dont know, Mike acted like he was searching for the right word, whorish for my taste.   I heard that! Ashton yelled.   Good! Put some pants on! Mike hollered back.   Just a couple of days guys and shell be on her own bus.  Luke was trying to keep the peace but Lenny couldnt figure out why.  Why was he being nice to her?  Yep, and I plan on treating her exactly as she deserves until then.  Mike stated plainly.   Luke let out a heavy sigh through his tired smile.  He looked at Lenny apologetically, Im going to bed.  He climbed into his bunk and closed the curtain.   Ashton whined for a while before she, too, finally went to bed.  Lenny half expected her to try to crawl into the same bunk as Luke but she didnt.  Thank God for small miracles, Lenny thought.   She and Mike stayed up watching classic movies, not speaking.  After Humphrey Bogart put Ingrid Bergman on the plane bound for Lisbon, Mike coaxed her into trying to get some sleep.   She climbed into her bunk and tried to block out what Ashton had said to her.  You think they care for you and theyll fight for you.  But they wont.  Lenny took that as a threat, Ashton was planning on getting rid of her.  Well Ashton James might have gotten her way in the past, but Lenny didnt lose.  Ever.  It was so on.        7    Breakout      Lenny got up the next morning feeling invigorated despite her lack of sleep.  She hadnt had a challenge in a long time, and Ashton James just bit off more than she could chew.  Lenny was determined to make her choke on it.   Ashton's presence on the tour was already oppressive.  Lenny could sense it in the mood of the crew.  It was like a black cloud hanging over each of them individually, waiting for the inevitable lightning strike.  It pissed Lenny off to see that Bitch Face could have that kind of power over the people in her life.  Not if I have anything to do with it.   She showered and dressed quickly, pulling her hair into a messy bun with a few wisps of hair escaping around her face.  She threw on her standard jeans, a snug, canary yellow tee and her trusty Chucks and quickly made her coffee rounds.  She greeted Carl in their usual spot with a beaming smile.   You look like sunshine this morning, Carl eyed her suspiciously.  You didnt kill Ashton by any chance, did you?  Not yet.  She said with a lopsided grin.   That woman makes my skin crawl.  Carl took a sip of coffee.   Are we sure shes even human? I mean, isnt there a separate classification for pure evil?  Carl gave Lenny an amused warning glare.  You better steer clear of that little nightmare, Lenny.  He said in his worried dad voice.   You have no idea how capable I am of handling her.  Lenny reassured him.  No idea at all.   Carl flashed her a look that said he was still unsure but proceeded to change the subject.   The good news is that Ive arranged to get hotel rooms for us when we reach Denver.  I booked you a nice suite since youll have spent the week in a vipers nest.   Thanks, Carl, Lenny smiled sweetly at him.  Carl didn't do favors for anyone.  Lenny recognized the huge deal that it was and she impulsively threw her arms around him.  He stiffened at her sudden embrace and she held back a laugh.   That's enough, he growled but Lenny heard the affection in his voice.   Her status in this band was solid, Ashton was an idiot.             The guys were tense.  Mike watched them eat quietly as he sipped his orange juice.  Lenny had gathered them up and taken them to breakfast but no one could find Luke. . . or Ashton.  Mike knew the guys were already running through their worst case scenarios in their heads.  Ashton had successfully thrown them back into a place of angst and distrust.   Everyone except for Lenny.  She was irritated but still peppy.  Mike watched as she tried to pull the guys out of their glum moods and he again thanked God for her existence.   Mike was pissed too.  He was doing his best to not entertain his own dark temperament, but it was still there, lingering in the back of his mind.  He really hoped Luke wasn't being stupid.  He'd been Ashton's lapdog once before.  It didn't work out.   We need to do something fun.  Lenny announced to the table causing the solemn eaters to stare at her.   What do you have in mind, mama? Blake finally asked tiredly.   I heard there is a bungee jumping area near here, her face lit up with rebellion.   I dont know if Carl would go for that.  Harrison eyed her suspiciously and Mike sniggered.  Lenny was definitely in a wild mood this morning.   Who says he has to know? She dared them, eyebrows raised.   The looks that went around the table ranged from terrified to excited.  Lenny didn't bend the rules.  Lenny would never go against Carl.  Lenny was predictable.  Lenny was safe.  This wasn't Lenny. . . was it?  Hell, Im in.  Mike was the first to commit; he knew why Lenny was feeling so unruly.  Ashtons presence was suffocating and Luke wasnt being himself.  He had pretty much gone off alone since Ashton had shown up.  And he was also avoiding the rest of the band.  Lenny was feeling a need to express her frustration and bungee jumping was a way better alternative than what Mike had come up with. . . binge drinking and smack.   The others turned to Mike, clearly surprised at his easy agreement.   Dude, we could die.  Harrison felt it necessary to point out the dangers, in case it wasn't obvious.   Yeah, but we wont.  Mike winked at Lenny and stood up from the table.  She joined him at the door where they turned to look at the others who were still gaping.   Mike chuckled and grabbed Lenny's hand, tugging her into the sunshine that matched the color of her shirt.             Mike looked down at the raging water below him from nearly two hundred feet.  This is a very bad idea.  He was having second thoughts at Lennys choice of activity for the day.   He looked at her getting her harness attached and was amazed at her calm focus.  She seemed more relaxed than he had seen her all tour.  It shouldnt have made sense, they were easily in the most dangerous scenario he could come up with, and she was acting like it was a trip to the mall, or whatever girls do for relaxation.  He had obviously underestimated her drive for extreme adventure.   Harrison, Blake and Sway had agreed to try it if Mike and Lenny went first.  But Mike could see the apprehension on their faces.  Harrison was visibly sweating.  He chuckled nervously to himself, what had they gotten themselves into?  Lenny approached the edge of the platform and listened to the instructions from the operator.  She nodded and took a deep breath.   Youre afraid to get on a snowboard again, but this doesnt scare you? Mike tried to reason with her.  Lenny flashed him a grin and then dove off the platform.   Mike's stomach dropped to his feet as he watched her body fly into the open air.  She got to the end of the line and her body rebounded and plunged again, continuing to oscillate up and down until all the energy was dissipated.  The operators lowered a rope to her, she attached it to her harness and they hauled her back to the platform.   That was awesome! Sway gave her a high-five.   Are you okay? Harrison asked, his eyes wide, trying to search for any visible injuries.   Im great! Lenny responded, Im gonna do it again! Her face was. . . serene, her cheeks pink from giddiness.   Mike shook his head; he knew it was his turn.  He would have to follow through since he had given the others such a hard time for being scared.   Youre gonna love it, she whispered in his ear as she gave him a quick hug.  She stood back, biting her bottom lip and grinning at the same time in anticipation of his jump.   Mike approached the edge and took a deep breath.  In a moment of courage he took a flying leap and was airborne.  The sensations that raced through him were indescribable.  He felt completely out of control but totally centered at the same time.  Then he experienced a brand new rush in the recoil.  His heart was stuck in his throat, but he knew his face had a silly grin plastered across it.  As soon as it had started, it was over, and they were pulling him back up.   His mighty leap impressed the guys and they got geared up to make their own jumps.  Lenny let loose more than all of them, jumping three more times herself before they had to call it a day and head back for sound check.  It was weird to not have Luke with them but they still had fun despite his absence.   Cant tell Carl, okay guys? Lenny leveled a serious look at all of them.   Why does it matter if Carl knows? Were the ones who hired you.  Sway said, and Mike noticed Lennys lip twitch at his words.   Lets just keep it between us, okay? Lenny said again earnestly and they all nodded in agreement.             Luke was late to sound check again, looking like he hadnt slept in days.  It was amazing, Ashton had only been a part of the tour for twenty-four hours and Luke had aged ten years.  His hair was more matted than stylishly messy and his eyes were unfocused and empty.   Lenny was helping the guitar techs, Dustin and Ben, get set up when Ashton pranced across the stage  Oh good, Ashton, Blake sounded relieved, Its just you, I thought I heard someone backing over a goat.  The guitar techs laughed and Ashton shot daggers at him.   Lenny stopped laughing when she saw Luke watching them.  He had never looked so lost.  Lenny took a step his direction but he minutely shook his head, signaling her to stop.  She frowned at his pinched expression, silently asking her question from across the stage.  He held eye contact with her for far too long, as if attempting to dump every thought and feeling he had into that one, simple communique.  Lenny nodded, understanding as much as she dared.   She left the stage in search of Carl.  No way Ashton was going to force the alienation of Luke from his friends.  Home-wrecking sociopath.             The show that night was better than the previous, but only marginally.  The rest of the band was tight but Luke struggled with playing and remembering all the lyrics.  He would look up from the mic and back to the sound booth but Lenny wasnt there.  He didnt know where she was and it bothered him.  He knew he was the only one at fault for why she had to stay away.  Punishment for past sins.   Luke trudged to his bus, no autographs or photos with fans.  His shoulders pulled down and he felt like shit.  He dreaded seeing Ashton.  She would be half naked again and obnoxious as hell.  He paused outside the door and took a deep breath, bracing himself for the inevitable chatter that she would start hurling at him.   He heard a stirring to his left and he frowned into the darkness.  He made out a shadowy figure waving him over.  Taking a few steps in that direction, he recognized Sway.   Whats goin' on? He asked his shifty friend.   Come with me.  Sway waved him to be quiet and just follow.  Luke shrugged and crept along the back of the venue in the dark with his bass player.  As they made their way along, Luke could hear more whispers and they came around a corner to an ugly brown van and the rest of his band.   The van was half hidden behind a dumpster but it looked like a throwback to their days when they were just starting out.  Complete with the rust over the wheel wells and graffiti decorating the outside.  The rest of the band members stood waiting for him in a semi-circle.  Luke was surprised at how relieved he was to see Lenny amongst his friends.   Were ditching the buses tonight.  Lenny hooked us up with a private ride.  Harrison smiled eagerly, Youre coming with us.   Luke looked around at the faces of his oldest friends and the girl he was falling for even more.  How did he ever deserve to find not just one good friend in this world but five? He nodded and they all piled into the decrepit van.   Luke noticed that Slim, their regular driver, was behind the wheel.  He slid into the seat next to Lenny and whispered a question in her ear, If Slim is here, whos driving the Blue Bus?  Lenny tried to hide her smile, Slims brother, Mo.  Her eyes met Lukes and he squinted, trying to figure out if she was serious.   Slims brother is namedMo? He asked slowly.   Lenny bit her bottom lip to keep from laughing and nodded.   Mike slid the door closed and settled into one of the captains chairs.  Harrison occupied the other captains chair and Blake was sitting cozy next to Luke and Lenny.  Sway took his position in shotgun and started calling out options for music to be played.   Luke patted Lennys thigh affectionately and asked, This was what you were doing during the show, wasnt it? She nodded with a smile and he squeezed her leg.  If she only knew the significance of what she had done, of what she did everyday. . .   Dont worry, though, she whispered to him, Carl knows, this is completely sanctioned.   Slim made his way out of the parking lot and onto the road before he turned on the headlights.   I feel like super spies! Harrison whispered excitedly.   Sway pushed an old tape into the ancient radio and cranked up the volume.  As Tom Pettys 'American Girl' started to play, the whole band joined in, singing at the top of their lungs.             As the van sped down the interstate, the band sang song after song together.  Lenny felt the icky stench of Ashton evaporate and she smiled in satisfaction.  This was the most liberated shed seen the guys all tour.  That included when they were jumping off that bridge earlier in the day.   This is exactly what it was like when we were young.  Harrison reminisced happily.   You guys traveled by van? Lenny asked, she loved to hear their old stories from before they made it big.  Especially when Harrison told them.   Yeah, in a crappy van just like this one, Harrison swiveled haphazardly towards Lenny.  She laughed as he almost spilled onto the floor.  He regained his balance on the loose bolts holding the seat down and continued.  Our van was brown, too.  We called it the Brown Streaker.  We were very creative musicians back then.   Lenny started with a small giggle but it grew into out of control belly laughter as Harrison kept going.  I was getting puked on nightly, and we couldnt always afford showers at the truck stops so  Gross! Lenny cried.  Who was puking on you?  Harrison pointed his thumb over his shoulder, Usually Sways current shag.   Hey! It wasnt my fault that they always seemed to have a lot to drink.  Sway defended from the front.   Sure, Harrison nodded in sarcastic agreement.  But all we had was this one van, with all of our stuff and us in it.  And Sway was always using it forextracurricular activities.   Eww.  Lenny scrunched up her nose.   Tell me about it.  Harrison shuddered at the memory, causing Lenny to laugh harder.   Who drove? Lenny asked curiously.   Not Blake! Mike said with force and Lenny waited for the explanation as Harrison put on his professor face.   Blake does not drive.   I drive just fine! Blake defended from the other side of Luke.   Blakehow do I put thishit a building.  Harrison stated flatly.   One time! Blake interjected.  He leaned over so Lenny could see the sincerity on his face.  One time, Lenny! It wasnt my fault.   Right, it was the buildings fault, how dare it be built where you wanted to drive.  Harrison continued, just as flat.  He raised his eyebrows at Lenny and she laughed even more.  Oh, I forgot, not just any buildingthe courthouse.   What?! Lenny exclaimed, How did you accidentally hit a courthouse, Blake Diedrich?! Her disappointed mother tone came out and all the guys laughed.   I dont know! It was dark. . . I have night blindness. . . I thought I saw a dog His voice trailed off as he gave up defending himself.   But at least he didnt set the van on fire.  Harrison gestured to Luke.  Lenny turned to him in shock.   Why do you think I gave up smoking? Luke grinned.   Wow, you guys.  How did you ever get anywhere? Lenny was genuinely surprised.   Oh, you know. . . hard work, good looks, Harrison ran his fingers through his hair, and of course were freaking talented out the ass.   Of course, Lenny agreed but she was still laughing.  She adored these guys, no one could replace them.  She was past the point of no return; she couldnt see herself leaving them.  Ever.   The guys started to get tired after a few hours and eventually began nodding off.  Lenny stayed awake, watching her fellas sleep.  Ashton wasnt getting her claws into them.  She leaned her head against the window and looked out at the stars.   Luke shifted in his seat next to her and she glanced over to see him and Blake snuggled up together.  She smiled, big, tough rock stars.   Whatever power Ashton used to have over Luke was in no way stronger than the bond that this band shared.  Lenny had to remind them of that.  Ashton was simply a distraction, she didnt matter.  Thats why Lenny had talked to Carl about renting the van and going ahead of the convoy.  The guys needed to harken back to the days of their youth, where this whole crazy thing started.   Two more shows before Denver, twelve total before Ashton left the tour.  Then a four week break over Christmas.   Lenny tried to focus on her job, but in the dark cabin with just the sound of the wheels on the road, her thoughts drifted to home.  She wondered what she would do during break.  She couldnt go home.  She hadnt called her parents in over a week.  The last phone call had been tense, they wanted her to come back.  She missed them, but she needed to be out here more.  She wasn't ready to face. . . all of that.   Maybe Carl would give her some sort of assignment over break to keep her occupied.  She could ask him later.   Scott was pissed; shed stopped answering his calls two weeks ago.  Her voice mail kept filling up.  She wouldn't even check it if she wasn't afraid it would be Carl.  Scott had been the most persistent of her family members.  She wished he would just back off and let her figure this thing out.   He didn't understand, none of them did.  How could they? She wasn't exactly being the most forthcoming with any of them.  Most of all, she was disappointed in herself.   Lenny pinched the bridge of her nose and squinted against the headache revving itself into full blown migraine.  Suddenly, Luke's arms were around her, pulling her against his chest and pressing his lips to her temple.  The headache fled as she instinctively buried her face in his shirt.   Sshh.  It's okay, I got you.  Luke whispered against her ear.   Lenny ignored her previous logic of avoiding more situations like this.  She needed him right now, it was that simple.  And somehow. . . he just knew.             Slim pulled over for breakfast at a little roadside diner.  He opted to eat alone at the counter but the other six squeezed into a booth.  They pushed each other playfully, taking up more space than they needed to.  The waitress was not amused at their antics and she grumpily took their order and walked away.   This was a great idea, Sway spoke for them all, We should get rid of the buses altogether and just travel like this again.  He leaned his elbows on the table and started to play with the sugar packets.   You feeling better, dude? Blake asked Luke who was sitting directly across from him.   Yeah, Luke smiled, feeling like himself again.  Sorry, I was acting so-  Menstrual? Blake finished for him.   Luke chuckled and nodded.  Yeah, I guess thats how I was acting, huh?  You guess? Dude, middle school girls are less moody than you, Blake grimaced.   I dont know why you let your tampon get all twisted just because Ashton James, walking bitch-fest that she is, happens to be around.  What? Does she have your balls in a jar somewhere? Blake's dark eyebrows rose accusingly.   They were giving him a hard time and Luke knew he deserved it.  Its hard to think clearly around her, I guess I just shut everyone out.  Sorry about that.  Again.   They took their time eating breakfast, enjoying the time together without any distractions.  They were in such a good mood they even got their grumpy waitress to smile before they left.   We have enough bunks in the Blue Bus for all of us, Luke looked around at the band, why dont we all just ride together?  I like it, Mike looked to Lenny for approval.   Hey, Im just the assistant.  You dont need my permission.  She held up her hands to show she wasnt protesting.   I dont know man, Sway began, I really hate that girl.  I don't want to sleep in the same vehicle as her.  What if she tries to molest me?  Gross, Sway.  Gross.  Lenny frowned in disgust and Luke smiled at how cute she looked when she was correcting Sway.  Like she was still shocked by some of the things he said.   But it might be fun to make her miserable, Blake pointed out.   We could go on a shower strike like last time, Harrison suggested.   Yes! Blake snapped his fingers and pointed at Harrison.  That! Were doing it.   Lenny closed her eyes and rubbed her forehead with her fingertips, Oh, geez.   Sorry, mama.  But we did promise you the full Rock Star experience, smelly guys and all, Sway grinned at her.   We should definitely be as authentic as possible, Mike was nodding his head.   You have to participate too, Lenny, Blake said, Youre one of us now.  He arched an eyebrow, daring her.   Luke was surprised when she took the bait and replied cheekily, I can hack it if you can.             They pulled into the parking lot of their next venue and their spirits were high.  As they made their way to the buses, Ashton came running out and grabbed Luke by the arms.   Baby! Where have you been? I was so worried! She glared at Lenny over Lukes shoulder and Lenny rolled her eyes.  It was weird, when Ashton called Luke, baby, Lenny didnt hear it as a term of endearment.  It sounded more like piglets squealing at their mothers teat.   Luke stepped around her, I was with my friends, I don't have to check in with you.  She backed up at his curt reply.   Ashton shook it off and ran to catch up to Luke, snaking her arm around his.  Lenny had to give it to her; the girl was either very persistent or thick as a brick.  Luke pulled his arm away and entered the bus, Ashton close on his heels.   My coffee angel, Carl greeted Lenny as she handed him a cup of steaming coffee she had brought with her from the diner.  I thought you might forget since the plans were a little different.   I could never forget you, old man, she flashed a smiled.  How did it go? Lenny asked, shed been slightly concerned for Carls safety once Ashton found out they had ditched her.   I think she put a hex on me, Carl said honestly.   That girl has issues, thats for sure, Lenny agreed.  The guys have decided to all ride in the same bus until Ashton gets her own.  Carl nodded his approval.  And, theyve started a shower strike, she added slowly.   Not that shit again, Carl sounded annoyed but his eyes held a hint of amusement, This is gonna get gross, you know.   They made me agree to it, too.  Lenny winced at her own confession and watched for his reaction.   Carl burst out laughing, Ashton is gonna be so pissed.             Sound check was amazing.  The guys were presenting a united front and it greatly improved the mood of the crew.  They weren't going to let Ashton get her way anymore.  In fact, they were doing a pretty good job of humiliating her.  She was constantly lurking about and it only provided more fuel to rip on her.  Its like she couldnt take a hint.   Why dont you go hang out with your minions? They like youat least thats what you pay them to do, Blake remarked as Ashton stood in the way of everyone.   Shut up, Blake, she bit.  No one likes you, youre just a washed up has-been from the gutter.   Blake's jaw worked under his skin and he growled back, Thats better than being a vapid whore with daddy issues.   Who says you dont have daddy issues, orphan? Ashton's sneer was heard more than seen.   I like your spray tan.  What shade is that? Overcooked yam?  The exchange of insults continued throughout the afternoon until Ashton threatened to call the Orphan Bus to reclaim Blake and he, in turn, threatened to set all of her undergarments on fire during her set.   Harrison intervened at that point, and convinced everyone to separate for the remainder of the evening so they could concentrate on why they were really all there. . . for the fans.   When Double Blind Study played their opening song, the crowd went nuts.  The place erupted with the standard crowd surfers and slam dancers but they were fueled by a more intense energy than ever before.  Lenny thought the roof was going to blow off, the fans yelled so loud.  She was tempted to jump into the crowd and let them carry her away.   Theyre on tonight.  Greg shook his head as he tried to keep up with all the changes to the set list.  The band pulled out some classics they hadnt played in a while.  Fan favorites and B-sides.  It felt more like a jam session then a regular set.  Lenny knew it was due to their impromptu road trip so they could reconnect to one another.   Ashton's witchcraft be damned.             It was day three of the shower embargo and Lenny felt her greasy hair with her fingertips.  She made a face and brushed it into a tight bun on top of her head.  She was really looking forward to that suite that Carl had promised her at the end of the week.   The plan was working very well.  Ashton was so mad she couldnt spit straight.  She complained about the smell constantly and she stopped trying to get close to Luke.  She kept making digs at Lenny about her trucker appearance, but Lenny always had a quick comeback that shut her up.  For the most part.   Lenny was alone in the bus, restocking and refilling the supplies.  She was making a list on the counter when she felt the hair on the back of her neck stick up.  She raised her eyes to see Ashton staring at her.  She was wearing a little pink dress that could be mistaken for a negligee, her voluptuous breasts proudly on display.   Dont forget to put soap on your list, she snarked.   Good one, Lenny said flatly.   Arent you embarrassed of yourself? Ashton looked her up and down, I mean, the grunge look is a little outdated.   Lenny glanced down at her dirty jeans and stained t-shirt.  She wasnt feeling great about how she looked but she wouldnt give Ashton the satisfaction of knowing that.  She shrugged and responded, At least no one has mistaken me for a hooker.   Ashtons nose flared and her lips pursed together tightly.   Sway skipped up the steps of the bus and into the room.  Uh-oh, do I smell tension? He waggled his eyebrows.   No, thats Lennys ass, Ashton said haughtily.  She started to wave her hand across her face and scrunched up her nose.  Sway! You stink, too!  Sway only laughed and got a water bottle out of the fridge.   How was sound check? Lenny asked, blocking out Ashtons presence.   Good.  Solid.  Sway thought for a minute and then asked Lenny, You wanna make-out?  Sway, you really would screw anything, wouldnt you? You have no standards.  Ashton said with disgust.   Thats not true.  Sway said sweetly, pushing his long, stringy hair out of his face.  I can honestly say that I have never wanted to bag you.   Ashton sputtered something unintelligible and stomped outside.   Sway laughed as she left then hugged Lenny to his side, I dont really wanna make out.   I know.   I mean, unless, you want to, he arched an eyebrow at her.   Lenny pushed him away and rolled her eyes.   Okay, okay.  But let me know if you change your mind, he winked and left again.   Lenny changed the sheets in the bunks and picked up the garbage that littered the floors.  She considered not changing the sheets in Ashtons bunk but thought better of it.  As she was pulling out the dirty, used blankets her notebook fell out onto the floor.   Lenny slowly picked it up, remembering that Luke had been the last one to have it.  Why was it in Ashtons bunk? Lenny paged through it and noticed some marks and notes had been made.  She recognized Lukes handwriting but that still didnt explain why she found it where she did.  She wasnt that upset about it.  She wasnt thrilled but she figured Ashton was planning something devious and Lenny had caught her before she could pull it off.   She tucked the notebook into a small cupboard behind the TV in the back lounge and checked the time.  A half hour till Ashtons set.  Lenny opted to leave her jacket despite the chilly fall air.  She knew the arena would be hot with all the bodies jumping up and down.  She jogged over to the stage area and took her seat next to Greg.   The lights came down and the band started up.  Ashton appeared on stage and began wooing the crowd with her haunting voice and complicated, nonsensical lyrics.  Her set was the usual, nothing extraordinary, until her closing song.   I wrote this when I was going through a tough time in my life.  I finally feel comfortable sharing it with you tonight.  Lenny gagged at Greg and he laughed.  But as Ashtons delicate vocals drifted slowly and seductively over the air, Lenny got a sinking feeling in her stomach and goose bumps stood up on her arms.   That bitch! Lenny said out loud.  Greg frowned at her, confused.  She stole my song! I wrote that!       8    Lines In Sand      As soon as the encore finished, Luke threw his guitar to one of the nearby techs and hurried to the bus.  He had to get to Lenny before she got to Ashton.  During the entire set he struggled with focus as different scenarios flashed through his mind.  Most of them ended with Ashton slapping Lenny with a restraining order and Lenny having to leave the tour.   Luke couldn't let that happen.  He had no idea what was in the future for them but he couldn't lose her.  Not yet.   The bus was empty.  His heart started to beat with something akin to panic.  He checked the other buses.  Empty.  The stage was getting broken down when he checked the sound booth.   Where did Lenny go? Luke asked Greg who was closing down his equipment.   I dont know, man, but she was pissed.  Are you sure you want to find her? He called after Lukes retreating back.   Luke was in a full out run, he hadnt seen Ashton or Lenny since the end of the show and he wasn't liking the disappearing act.  He knew that Ashton had crossed the mother of all lines and she deserved whatever she was getting but Luke didn't want Lenny to have to deal with all that alone.  Ashton would ruin everything if given the opportunity.  She knew exactly what she was doing and it made him sick to his stomach.   He ran back inside the venue and almost knocked over Carl.   Have you seen Lenny? Luke panted.   Yeah, shes in the office, he pointed to the door he had come from, I was just coming to find you.  Have you seen Ashton?  Luke shook his head dumbly and entered the small, dimly lit room.  She was sitting in a chair at a desk talking on her cell phone and jotting down a few notes.  She looked up at Luke and gave him a quick smile and went back to her conversation.   Yep, well be in Denver tomorrow. great, see you then.  She hung up the phone and turned her attention to Lukes worried expression.   That was my lawyer, she explained, looking almost annoyed.   Your lawyer? Luke was trying to follow along.  His head swirled with confusion from adjusting to the drastic change in what he had expected to find and the reality sitting before him.   Lenny frowned at him, Are you okay?  Are you? Luke didnt understand why he had hadnt found Lenny with her fingers wrapped around Ashton's throat.   Yeah, why? She smiled, Oh, because of Bitchy McThievery stealing my song?  Luke nodded, watching her warily.  His heartbeat thudding in his ears as he tried to calm down from the last few minutes of anxiety that he had experienced.   Scott, always trying to protect me, she rolled her eyes, came across my journal awhile back and made me get a copyright. . . So, Im suing her.  She ended with a wink.   Luke closed his eyes and a low chuckle started that grew into full on belly laughter as he released the tension that had been building during the whole show.  He reached over and grabbed Lennys hand and pulled her into a hug, still laughing.   Whats so funny? Her voice was muffled against his shirt.   Youre the best.  He pulled her back and looked into her face.  I was afraid you were going to kill her and I was going to have come and visit you in jail.   It was Lennys turn to laugh, Believe me, I thought about it, but I decided this option would be way more satisfying.  I'm not an idiot, I know what she's trying to do.  I just won't play her game.  He grinned and squeezed her against his chest again.   Lenny pushed him away playfully, You stink!  You should talk! Luke gave a hurt look but Lenny wasnt falling for it.   Cmon, she moved to the doorway and looked at him over her shoulder, lets go hang out with other awesome people.   Luke shook his head to himself in wonder.  How did a woman like this come to be in his life? She was such a stark change from every other girl he'd ever dated or been around.   When they entered the bus, Ashton was sitting in her usual perch on the couch with a smug smile on her face.  The rest of the guys were clustered around the kitchenette, avoiding her entirely.  Luke nodded to Harrison to pass him a couple of waters for him and Lenny.   Um, Harrison questioned openly, shouldnt there be some sort of, I dont know, discussion? About what happened tonight?  What do you mean? Luke decided to play dumb, wanting to know what Ashton had told the guys.   Well, you took off after the set and Ashton told us just now that you guys wrote that last song together. . .  Harrison trailed off, confusion all over his face.   Are you writing songs with Ashton? Blake asked, more agitated and confrontational than Harrison.   So that was how Ashton was playing it.  She wasn't only trying to get rid of Lenny, she was trying to pull the guys away from him too.  She really needed to revamp her diabolical planning skills.   Actually, Lenny interrupted as she flopped herself onto the sofa right next to Ashton.  I wrote that.  She stole it from me.   Luke held back a smile as he saw Ashton shift awkwardly.  She obviously didn't expect Lenny's blas reaction.   But, thank you, Ashton, Lenny's tone danced on the edge of sarcasm.  You made it sound beautiful.  She took a long drink from her water bottle as Ashton scowled at her.   Just then, Ashtons cell phone rang.   You might wanna get that, Lenny gestured.  Ashton frowned at her and took her phone to the back of the bus.  Lenny held up her hand, signaling the others to wait for it.   WHAT?! Ashton shrieked.   There it is, Lenny said, satisfied.  I imagine that was her lawyer telling her the happy news that I'm suing the crap out of her.  She held her bottle of water up in toast, Heres to a successful shower strike and copyright infringement!            Shane: Scott texted me, he said that she's going to be in Denver tomorrow      Cody: no shit? Are you going to see her?      Shane: I don't think that would be a good idea      Cody: I'll do it      Shane: let me know how it goes            Lenny sank deep into the bubbles in the over-sized tub.  She relaxed into the hot smell of jasmine and closed her eyes.   The suite Carl had gotten for her was by far the greatest perk of her job that she had experienced yet.  It was three separate rooms, a living room with a fireplace, an office area and a spacious bedroom with a King-sized bed.  The bathroom had an elevated round tub and a separate shower area.   The first thing Lenny did when she got her room key was take a shower.  While the shower strike had been highly successful in irritating Ashton and bringing the band closer together, Lenny silently vowed to never do that again.   When she felt thoroughly cleansed of the 'on-the-road-ick,' she filled the tub with bubbles and proceeded to soak her tired muscles.   She planned on enjoying her last day of freedom as much as she could.  She knew that calling her lawyer was going to open up a whole new sack of cats but teaching Ashton a lesson was totally worth it.   Lenny heard a knock at her door and sighed.  That was fast.  She grabbed a towel and dried herself off and then wrapped the hotel provided robe around herself.  She crossed her spacious living quarters as another knock sounded.   She opened the door to find Carl, pacing, per his usual.   Carl, what a surprise, Lenny said dryly.   Carl smiled reluctantly and entered the suite as Lenny extended her arm signaling him to do so.  He looked around, admiring her accommodations.   How do you like your room? He asked too casually.   I like it a lot.  Whats up, Carl? She didn't want the small talk.  She wanted to return to the bathtub and pretend she wasn't getting ready to have a crappy night.   Before Carl could answer, someone else knocked on the door.  Lenny opened it and found Harrison and Blake.  They entered without being invited in.   Nice digs, Blake whistled.  He dropped into an over-stuffed navy blue chair and swung his legs up over the arm rest.   Hey, Carl.  Harrison opened the in-room fridge and started rummaging for snacks.   Before the door to the hallway closed completely, Sway slipped inside.  He kissed Lennys cheek on the way by, You smell nice, is that jasmine? He joined Harrison on the couch and turned on the giant plasma screen.   What are you guys doing here? Lenny asked, trying to stay patient.   Waiting for Mike and Luke.  Sway answered like Lenny shouldve known.   What? Why? She frowned and crossed her arms over her chest.   'Cause were going out tonight.  Harrison said matter of fact and then looked at Blake, Arent we?  Blake rubbed the scruff on his face and nodded, Yeah, karaoke, right Carl?  Lenny turned her attention to Carl who smiled sheepishly.   You told me I could have the night off, Carl, her tone was more cross than she intended and Carl winced.   Sway looked up and his eyes narrowed, What do you mean, night off? Were just hanging out.  Geez, Lenny, is being our friend really work to you? His tone was lighthearted but Lenny could tell he was fishing.   Lenny pursed her lips and swallowed, sidestepping that relational landmine and replied, I just meant that I have a meeting with my lawyer tonight.  And I thought we could all use a rest.  Sway seemed satisfied with her answer and went back to the TV.   Lenny motioned for Carl to step aside so they could talk privately.   Im meeting my lawyer in a couple of hours, I cant go to karaoke.   Carl nodded his understanding, Okay.  But I just wanted to let you know, Sway was right, this isnt part of the job.  I thought you might wanna blow off some steam with us tonight.   Youre going, too? Lenny frowned.   Carl laughed quietly, Well, yeah.  I get a day off too every once in a while, you know.   Lenny conceded to that point but it still surprised her that Carl could so easily cross those lines of real friendship and professionalism so quickly when hed been on target the whole tour.   Where you meeting the lawyer? Blake spoke up from his lounged position in the chair.   Um, theres a fancy restaurant up the street, Lenny's stomach started to dive to the floor.   Can we all eat together and then go out after youre finished talking to your rep?  Lenny shifted uncomfortably.  She didnt really want the guys around when her attorney brought down the hammer.  The stuff with Ashton was simple, Lenny just had to sign some papers, but she knew there was going to be a more serious conversation after that.  Her mind raced as she tried to think of an excuse to not have them there without having to tell them the whole story anyway.  And she really didn't want to relive that nightmare.   She resigned herself to Blakes suggestion, Yeah, thatll work.  But its gonna take me a little while to get ready.   Thats fine, well chill here.  So much for my relaxing bath, Lenny thought.   Carl, how come Lenny has a bigger room than us? Harrison asked.   'Cause shes better than us, dummy.  Blake answered, Harrison nodded like he agreed.   Lenny shook her head and closed herself in her room to finish getting ready.  As she was applying her mascara she heard Mike and Luke show up and Blake fill them in on the plan.   Lenny shimmied into the little black dress she had purchased at the boutique across the street from the hotel.  She hadnt packed anything to wear to a formal restaurant and needed something fast.  The dress was modest in the front, it was snug but the hem reached her knee and the neckline draped gracefully across her collarbone.  It was sleeveless with a beaded embellishment at the shoulders.   She finished blow drying her hair and slipped into a pair of black platform stilettos.  She applied a light coat of champagne colored lip gloss and took a deep breath.  She hadnt been part of this world in a while and she wasnt sure how the guys would react, or if they would even recognize her.   She glanced at the clock on the nightstand, time to find out.   She opened the door and stepped into the living area, moving quickly to the door and pulling a knee-length black coat out of the closet.  She turned around to face the guys as she slipped her arms in the sleeves.  The reaction was what she had dreaded.  They gaped at her with open mouths and she felt heat move up her neck.   Cmon, we have to go, she motioned for them to get up, not caring if she sounded impatient.   Damn! Blake finally said something, You look he trailed off.   Lets not make a thing out of this, okay? Lenny was cross, she clenched her jaw and led them out of the hotel room.   Sway whistled, We are severely under dressed.   You guys will be fine, Lenny sighed in exasperation, refusing to have eye contact with any of them on the elevator or their quick trip through the lobby.  She couldn't handle seeing herself through their expressions.  She had always hated this part of her life and she had tried her best to keep them out of it.  As unrealistic as that might be.   Its just a block north of here, Lenny was already walking down the sidewalk, as Luke tried to hail a cab, We can walk.   In those shoes? Mike exclaimed.  But she was already striding purposefully forward.  The guys followed, she wasn't giving them the choice.   Fueled by her frustration and irritation in the impending events, she barely noticed the disdainful looks given by the wait staff when they entered the restaurant.   Miss Evans, we've been expecting you.  The host greeted her, eying her group suspiciously.   Theyre with me, Louise, she knew she sounded bitchy.  She hated herself for it.  He nodded reluctantly and motioned to a girl standing nearby.  The girl proceeded to lead them to a table in a private room towards the back of the crowded restaurant.   The room was empty except for a flurry of waiters rearranging the table and settings to accommodate the group they hadnt expected.  The girl who had seated them took their drink orders and disappeared.   The guys began to relax somewhat and the table buzzed with hushed conversation.  Lenny sipped her water and sat perfectly still, staring at the center of the table in deep thought.  This was never part of the plan.   She hadnt just come from a family of athletes like she had told Luke.  Both her father and mother were Olympic gold medalists, so was her brother Nathan.  They were also incredibly wealthy, owning several high-end restaurants and resorts all around the world.  Including the one they were in.  Brushing shoulders with the upper class of America had been part of her upbringing.  Its one of the reasons snowboarding had appealed to her, it was the opposite of everything that surrounded her.  But she could do it.  She could put on the clothes and walk in the shoes and say all the words, but it literally felt like every cell in her body was screaming to run away.   She focused on her breathing while she stared at the flickering candle in front of her.  She felt eyes on her but didn't look up to see who they belonged to.  Probably Luke.  She could sense his concern from across the table.  She hated that he was worried.  She hated that it had to do with her.  She had wanted to do this meeting privately but it wasn't feasible.  Hopefully it would be over soon.   As three men approached the table wearing very expensive suits, Lenny sighed.  She should have known that Patrick would call her father.   She stood up as he leaned in to kiss her cheek.   Lenna, he addressed with a smile.   Dad, Lenny acknowledged wearily, I didnt know you would be here.   Who are your friends? Lennys father asked politely.   The guys stood up to shake the mans hand as Lenny introduced them all by name.   This is my father, Bruce Evans.  She saw the realization dawn in each of their eyes as they greeted him and knew another piece of her anonymity was slipping away.   The Bruce Evans? Harrison asked excitedly.  Three gold medals and world record holder for the Mens 200m backstroke?  Thats right, Bruce humbly smiled.   Its an honor to meet you, sir.  Harrison continued to gush, I had no idea you were Lennys father.   Well, she looks more like her mother, Bruce's eyes crinkled on the sides as he smiled warmly at his daughter.  Lenny's heart was stabbed with guilt at how wonderful he was treating her friends.   Lenny introduced the second man, who was easily a younger version of the first, This is my brother, Scott.   Scott Evans stood a great deal taller than most of the men around the table.  His athletic build fit nicely into his tailored suit.  His dark brown hair was a contrast from Lennys blonde, which he kept shaved nearly bald.  He shook hands with everyone at the table and seated himself at the end.  Lennys lawyer, Patrick, sat on the corner next to Scott with Lenny to his left.   The rest of them took their seats with Lennys father sitting at the head, so he could best converse with all present.  Lenny avoided speaking with her father and her brother.  Instead, she focused on the papers her lawyer had already presented to her.  Bruce entertained her friends by regaling them with tales from his youth.  They were completely star struck.  Food and drink flowed easily and Lenny was surprised at how effortlessly they got along with her father.  They didnt exactly move in the same circles.   Wait a second! Harrison looked at Lenny, shocked, Youre Lenny Freebird Evans?  At Harrison's words, Lenny's mouth went dry.  She took a drink of water and slowly put the glass back on the table, not really acknowledging Harrison's question.   No way, Sway looked at Lenny as if meeting her for the first time.   I remember you! Blake couldnt hide the awe in his voice, You could really fly.   I dont do that stuff anymore.  It was all she could think to say, her ears turning red with heat.  Her father allowed a lengthy pause before speaking again.   So, you are the group of ruffians my one and only daughter decided to run off with? Bruces tone was serious but his eyes sparkled with mischief.   Maybe you can convince her to come home, Scott spoke up from his end of the table.   Were in the middle of a tour, Scott.  I have responsibilities, Lenny spoke to him sharply.   Yes, you do, he leveled at her.  She grimaced; she had walked right into that one.  Speaking of, he gestured to Patrick, her lawyer, sitting next to her.   The well-dressed attorney picked up on his cue and explained to Lenny flatly, Youre in breach of contract with your sponsors.  They are threatening to begin litigation.   Lennys shoulders stiffened, Cant you just settle and give them some money?  If they proceed, theyll try to clean you out.   I dont care about the money, Lenny stated forcefully.   Honey, her father addressed, and Lenny turned to him for the first time since they'd sat down.  His face was filled with compassion for her and her heart stalled in her chest, Theyll take the Lodge.   They cant do that! She was combative.  Thats my home! Her voice cracked slightly.  Thats Dukes home. . .   Her hands started to shake and she gripped her napkin under the table.  She looked to Scott for an explanation.   Scott softened his expression, Why do you think Ive been trying to get a hold of you?  Lenny stared hard into Scott's eyes, looking for some sign that this wasn't as bad as her gut was telling her it was.  Honesty looked back.  Her attempts to avoid having to deal with her mistakes had created a much bigger problem than she had anticipated.   She let her shoulders drop, defeated.  That was her one weak spot.  The Lodge wasnt just her home.  It was Dukes home too.  She could always move on and buy a new house, but Duke had nowhere to go.   Always the renegade, Duke refused to live in the public eye.  Rumors swirled of him being too mentally deficient to understand what it meant to be paid for snowboarding.  He denied sponsorship and remained relatively untamed, a mountain boy to the core.  As such, he couldnt make a decent enough living to buy his own place and continue doing what he loved most.  Big mountain riding.   Lenny had purchased the Lodge years ago when the money had started rolling in.  It was a massive estate-like cabin in the mountains of Wyoming with five bedrooms, six bathrooms, multiple living areas and lounges.  She had bought it with the intent of her and her friends being able to live there and snowboard the mountains right out the back door.  Duke had been such an influential mentor to her, she made a deal with him.  He could live there for free, forever, as long as he maintained the property.  If she lost the Lodge, Duke would be homeless.  And it would be her fault.  She couldnt do that, Duke had done too much for her.  He meant too much to her.   What do I have to do? She asked, quietly submissive.   Just make a few appearances until your contract runs out.  You know, smile, wave and take pictures.  Patrick explained it at all so simply.  He had no idea how hard those things were actually going to be for her.  The Winter X-Games is the next one, its in January.  Can I confirm to your sponsors that youll be there?  Thats during break, Lenny, its completely fine, Carl tried to comfort her, misunderstanding the duress on face.   Yes, Ill be there, she said, refusing to meet anyones eyes.  She was humiliated that this had to happen so publicly for her.  But this is how she had set herself up so she really shouldn't be surprised.   Well all be there, Luke interjected earnestly.   Lenny's head jerked up at his words.  She tried to read his expression but was too distracted by her own messy thoughts to make sense of anything.   Yeah, we'll be your assistants for a change, Mike said with a sly smile, backing up Luke like always.   Just let me know how many will be in your party and Ill get rooms reserved at The Inn, Patrick said, diligently on duty.   Lenny realized everyone was staring at her and she needed to snap out of her funk or there would be more questions.  Questions she didn't have answers for yet.  She couldn't start thinking about Aspen and who else would be there.  She would have to deal with that later.  Alone.   She forced a smile and set about trying to make the meal more pleasant.  She discussed business with Scott, told some stories of what life had been like so far on the road and reminisced with her father.  As the evening progressed, more of Lennys life came into detail and was suddenly up for discussion.   So, let me get this straight, Carl was really having a hard time believing that the Lenny, who had worked for him ardently for the past couple of months, had ditched on her own manager and brother, Scott.  You just left town? You were supposed to be in a meeting and you just. . . got on a plane?  Pretty much, Lenny laughed a little at Carls incredulous look.   Whats the big deal, Carl? So she got on a plane, Harrison was attempting to defend Lenny by making it seem like her actions were insignificant, Its not like she took the talent bungee jumping or something.   Carl blinked and did a double-take at Harrison, Whywhy would you say that?  Harrison shrugged, Ive had a lot of wine.   Carl started to ask Harrison more but Blake interrupted, I think what Harrison is saying is that, Lennys still a responsible person.  She just needed a change of scenery.  Blake looked to Lenny for approval, And it worked out great for us; we ended up with the best assistant in the world.   You guys went bungee jumping without me? Luke was catching on quicker than Carl but not as fast as he should have.   Lenny covered her mouth with her hand to block her smile.  She wondered how many secrets were going to all spill out tonight.  Subtly wasn't really in the rock star repertoire.             As they all stood on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant saying goodnight, Lennys father held her in a tight embrace.   He kissed her forehead and looked at her lovingly, You have always made me proud.   Lenny fought the lump rising in her throat at his affectionate display.  Bruce Evans had never had a problem showing his daughter how much he cared about her, not even in public.   Be good and call your mother, he hugged her a final time before getting into his waiting town car.   Scott wrapped his strong arms around his sister and gave her a tight hug, You need to give Duke a call, too.  He worries.   No, he doesnt, Lenny scoffed.   Yes, he doesand try to come home for Christmas.  We miss you, too.  Scott hugged her again before getting in the car with their father.   Mike put his arm around Lenny and pulled her towards the hotel, Feel better, darlin'?  Lenny only nodded.  She really did.  She wasnt exactly looking forward to bringing them to the X-Games, she still had a lot of thoughts and issues to work through before they got there.  But as she looked at her unconventional surrogate family she felt better knowing she wasnt going alone.   Hopefully she'd find the strength to face her demons before then.        9    Beautiful Disaster      Luke stood outside Lenny's room, his hand poised to knock.  He just wanted to see her.  She had looked great at dinner.  Beautiful, but. . . sad.  He felt the pull to her from the lobby and didn't resist it.  He knew she would be alone.  He knew she needed him.   He knew this could all blow up in his face.   He looked down at the guitar case in his hand and blew all the air out of his lungs as he knocked on the door.  They finally had a break from the long, dragging hours on the bus and all he wanted was to be in the same room with her.  Since Ashton had shown up, he'd felt like he'd hardly seen Lenny.  He missed her.   Hey, Luke didn't have more than that for a greeting.  Lenny leaned against the door frame before smiling and standing aside to signal his entrance.  She had changed out of her dress and her face was washed clean of makeup.  Hair piled loosely on top of her head, she was in sweatpants and a white tank with a band hoodie half-zipped over the top.  She was breathtaking.   Didn't you go with the guys? She asked as she closed the door behind him and then crossed the room and folded herself into an overstuffed navy chair.   No, I wanted to see you.  He sat opposite her on the couch and tried to look as relaxed as possible, placing the guitar case down on the floor next to him.   Lenny was more subdued that usual.  She sat quietly, not responding to his statement.  Her pensive gaze was fixed on the sleeves of her jacket and her vulnerability was conspicuous.   Big night.  Luke hated how his voice sounded harsh in the quiet of the suite.   Yeah, Lenny gave him a small smile and he saw that her attention had left her shirt sleeves and she was now watching him quietly.  Her countenance hinting at the softness he knew lay inside her, buried deep for safekeeping.   So, what happens with Ashton now? He asked, not wanting to talk about his ex but needing somewhere to start.   She'll have to pay me some money and she'll probably stay away for a while.  Lenny answered with a half-smile on her face.  Luke adored her half-smile.   What about this thing with your sponsors? How you feeling about that? Luke didn't miss the flicker of fear flash across her face; it was very uncharacteristic of her.   Um, she looked back to her lap, it'll be weird, but I can't lose the Lodge.  So. . .  Her voice trailed off and Luke didn't miss the fact that she wouldn't look at him when she answered.   Your brother is a beast.  Luke tried to bring the conversation somewhere lighter.  He needed her to be comfortable if he was going to go through with his original intention of seeing her.   Yeah, he has that effect on people, Lenny laughed a little then and eased back in her chair.   And your dad seems pretty cool, too, Luke added, trying to get a decent conversation flowing.  He'd never been good with small talk.   I probably give my family a harder time than they deserve.  Her demeanor was shifting, ever so slightly back to confidence.  The strange awkwardness that had been present a moment ago was dissipating and Luke internally high-fived himself.   I'm sorry I'm so weird about the snowboarding thing, Lenny suddenly blurted out.  I haven't dealt with it very well, or at all, actually.  She looked up at him sheepishly, I don't handle failure gracefully, if you hadn't noticed.   Luke chuckled and leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees, You think we deal well with failure? I'm pretty sure that's just part of being human.   He began to point to his fingers one at a time, Let me give you some of my favorite examples of how well we dealt with the failure of our last tour.  Mike: started his own carpet laying business after he was clean and then refused to speak to me.  Sway: got married to a stripper in Vegas and divorced within the week, twice.  Harrison: tried to become a carpenter with disastrous, and might I add expensive, results.  Blake: tried his hand at the culinary arts but mostly he gained twenty-five pounds.  It wasn't pretty.   Lenny snickered at his examples, What about you? she asked, What did you do?  Youve met my ex, right? Tall, brown hair, answers to Satan? Luke rolled his eyes at himself, Yeah, I bought her a house.   Whoa! I didnt know that! No wonder she had a hard time moving on, you were her sugar daddy.  Lenny teased, trying to stifle her laughter.   As you can see, you dont have anything to be embarrassed about, Luke reassured her.   Did you love her? Lenny asked, unexpectedly serious.   Luke was taken aback, he had never thought about it.  He shook his head, No, I just hated being alone and she was hot.  Not my proudest moment.  He paused as he thought about it, I didn't even like her back then.  I think I bought her the house because I was hoping she would stay there, and away from me.   What about you? He turned the question around, Have you ever dated someone you couldnt stand?  A mixture of confusion and hurt swept across her face and Luke knew he'd touched a nerve.  Her brows drew together and she licked her lips before answering.   I really only ever had one boyfriend.  I liked him a lot.  Her voice grew quiet, I never got to know him enough to find out if I could love him.   What happened? Luke tried to sound mellow.  But he wasn't.  The idea of another man in Lenny's life had him feeling on edge instantaneously.   We broke up after the accident.  Lenny was being dodgy and he could tell there was more she wasn't saying.   That was kind of a dick move.  Luke defended her.  How could someone let a girl like this get away? Whoever it was, was an idiot.   It wasnt. . . I'm the one who ended it.  I broke up with him, her voice was strained and she was avoiding his eyes again.   He shouldve fought for you, Luke argued.  Her words weren't matching her demeanor and Luke was suddenly very angry at the guy who had obviously put a fracture in her heart.   That's not really. . .  Lenny shook her head and closed her eyes, It wasn't meant to be, that's all.   After an uncomfortable pause Luke spoke again, needing to drive his point home.  I wouldve fought for you.   When Lenny looked at him, his heart about stopped in his chest.  Her eyes were watery and her lips were parted, as if to say something into the silence.  But nothing came.  Her eyes sought an explanation, one she couldn't outright ask and Luke knew this was the moment.   Very few times in Luke's life did he know exactly what step he was supposed to take.  He usually guessed wrong and had to go back and try again.  His past was filled with apologies, misunderstandings and broken fences that no one could mend.  Not this time.  Not with this moment.   He unpacked his guitar and set it on his lap, his hands beginning to tremble.  He grit his teeth.  He needed to do this.  It would be worse not to.  He ached to hold her, to kiss her, to make her feel what he felt.  He needed to have some sort of absolution to the dance they were in.  He couldn't possibly be the only one feeling overpowered by his own heartbeat.   Lenny, I haven't done the best job at showing you or telling you what you mean to me, he cleared his throat, But I communicate better through music so. . .  He took a cleansing breath before he brought the pick to meet the strings in his chosen method of confession.   You're not pushing but I'm falling  you're soaring and I'm stalling  and it's not a secret  that my strength is your weakness      the beauty you have inside  shines out through your eyes  you wear your heart on your sleeve  your wings flutter and you leave      and when you fly  can I be your blue sky  when your heart beats alone  let my arms be your home  if I say it first  will you say it second  if I give you this verse  will you feel protected      I need you  could you need me too. . .   He waited for what felt like too many breaths before he sought her eyes.  Did she understand the enormity of what his soul had admitted? Did she know that this wasn't some elaborate attempt to get in her pants but that he meant every freaking word?  I do need you.  Her voice came out rough and Luke stared at her mouth, wanting her to say it again.  She licked her bottom lip and took a shaky breath.   For the all the daydreaming that Luke had done about her and exactly how he would kiss her for the first time, he was suddenly very nervous.  The first kiss with her could very well be the most important of his life.   Luke put the guitar down and crossed the small space between them.  He pulled Lenny to her feet and grabbed her around her waist with one arm, pressing her against him.  With his other hand he cupped her neck and angled her face upwards.  He looked from her eyes to her lips, hesitating for a fraction of a second.  She didn't pull away.  She didn't protest.  His mouth came down against hers, feeling the firm softness of her lips as they returned his kiss.  He thought that the taste of her would finally quench his desire, but it only fed his hunger for more.   He had planned on kissing her slowly, taking his time, making it last.  But when the moment came, he lost control.  He lost himself in her.   He felt her hands fist into his t-shirt, pulling him closer.  His heart raced as he realized his eagerness was being reciprocated.  The intensity of their kiss grew as their weeks of self-restraint were suddenly released in that one moment.  Her hands worked their way into his hair and Luke let out a groan.   They were yanked back into reality by the sudden knock at the door.  They jumped apart as if they'd been shocked.   Luke took a deep breath to steady himself.  Lenny straightened her clothes and made her way to the door, checking the peep hole.  She took one more calming breath before opening it.   There you are, Carl smiled at Luke, The guys wanna know if you want to join us for a game of poker in Blakes room? He looked back and forth between Lenny and Luke, frowning.  You guys werent fighting, were you? He asked, misreading the tension.   Lenny smiled, No, just talking.  Im actually pretty tired so Im going to get some sleep.  But you should go, Luke, win some money back from Blake.   Luke tried to read her face but she was as unreadable as ever.  He nodded as he thought about it, Yeah, Ill be right down.   Great! Carl turned to leave, See you in a bit.  Goodnight, Lenny.   Goodnight, Carl.   The door closed and Lenny and Luke stared at each other in silence.  Everything between them had changed in the span a few breaths.   I dont want to go.  Luke finally said, his soul screaming at him to say more.   I know, but you have to, she whispered.   Her cheeks were still pink from their momentary passionate embrace.  She looked at him with clear eyes and Luke knew she wasn't asking him to leave because she didn't want this.  It was because she wanted it as badly as he did.   Luke charged across the room and crushed her to him.  His hands started on her hips, making their way up to her hair as he kissed her desperately.  She responded strongly, wanting him just as badly.   He stepped back, breathless, her kiss making him dizzy.  He held her face in his palm and touched her lips with his thumb.  This is far from over, he whispered roughly.   He left reluctantly, looking at Lenny one last time before closing the door.  As he walked down the hall and to the elevators he tried to calm down.  He had kissed lots of girls, more than he could count.  But no one had knocked the wind out of him.  No one made him feel like the earth had been slightly knocked off it's axis.   He smiled to himself as the lift opened and he stepped inside.   She had kissed him back.             Luke stared at the ceiling.  He had lost every hand in the poker game.  He didnt care.  He kept thinking about Lenny, alone in her room.  He wanted to go to her, keep her company.  Hold her.  Kiss her.  Explain the things that remained unexplainable without her around.   I kissed Lenny.  He said out loud to the ceiling.   Mike was lying in the next bed and he propped himself up on his elbow and looked at Luke in the dark.  Whaaat? He sounded like he was laughing but Luke couldnt see his face.   When? Mike asked.   Tonight.  Before the game.   Mike was definitely laughing.  Where?  On the mouth.   Mike really laughed then, No, dude, where were you when you kissed her?  Oh, in her room.   Mike waited for more information then asked, Was it awesome?  Yeah.   Mike laid back down and chuckled again.  Its about freakin' time, thats all I have to say.   Luke smiled broadly.   It also explains that stupid grin you had on your face the whole night.   I lost a lot of money to Blake.   Mike guffawed.   Is it wrong? Am I screwing up all our lives?  Don't be ridiculous, Mike chided.  You two make the most sense of anything ever.   You really think so? Luke felt his nerves settle into a bundle in the pit of his stomach.   Oh yeah.  Mike said confidently.  She's your song.   What do you mean?  Every good lyric, melody or riff is Lenny in a package.  Anyone can see it.  You look at her and you just know. . . she's the one you've been singing about all this time.  You just didn't know it.   Luke felt his mouth tug up on the side in a smile.  That's exactly why he told Mike stuff like this.  For answers like that.   Mike, dont tell the others yet.   You know me; I always got your six, brother.   Luke sighed contentedly.  He knew they were moving in the right direction finally but he didnt want to go too fast and scare her away.  This was a whole new ballgame.             Lenny was all smiles when she woke the next morning.  She had slept better last night than she had in years.  She took a shower and dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt with the black band hoodie.  She literally skipped to Carl with his coffee.   Youre awfully spunky today, he eyed her suspiciously.   The healing power of sleeping in a real bed, Lenny joked.  Well, that and finally having all those secrets come out last night lifted a weight off me.   Carl nodded, Thats why honesty is always the best policy.   A wave of guilt washed over Lenny and she changed the subject quickly.   I better get the buses put back in order before we leave tomorrow.  She was already hurrying off before Carl could ask any more questions.  She had promised him that nothing would happen with any of the band members and something had definitely happened.   She had a lot to do, moving Blake, Sway and Harrisons things back to the Red Bus, changing the sheets in the Blue Bus and restocking food.   She was just finishing up in the Blue Bus when Luke appeared.  They had eye contact and Lenny couldnt hide her excitement to see him.  He grinned and rushed to her, kissing her face and lips passionately.   He looked over his shoulder to see if anyone was coming.  Satisfied they were alone for the time being, he let his fingers linger in her hair as he kissed her again and again.   I missed these lips, he whispered between kisses.   We have to keep this quiet, Luke.  Lenny pulled away from his kisses and gave him a serious look.  If Carl finds out, he'll fire me so fast.   He gave her a lopsided grin, Hey, I totally got this.   She rolled her eyes and he planted one more kiss on her lips before he really had to go.  Someone would get suspicious if they werent careful.   He walked to the door, turned and let his eyes rove over her face, unapologetic.  He tapped the door frame with his fingertips like he had something important to say.   Instead, he gave her a wink, Ill see you later.  And he ducked out the door.   Lenny grinned, she felt like a teenager.  She knew she was behaving ridiculously but it was hard to stop.  For the first time in a long time, she felt like she could breathe again.             Cody bullied her way into the arena using a combination of flirting and threats.  It always seemed a touch harder to get what she wanted than she thought it should be.  You catch more flies with honey.  Her grandfather's words echoed in her head and she rolled her eyes at the memory.  Foolish old man.   She spotted Lenny immediately despite the security giants trying to block her way.  Her hair was longer and not in that god-awful braid she had insisted on wearing since. . . well, since then.   Lenny Effing Freebird Evans! Cody shouted at the top of her lungs, ignoring security as they tried to muscle her back out the door.  Her voice echoed through the open space and she smirked with satisfaction when she saw that brilliant head of golden hair whip around in her direction.   Lenny nodded to security and they let Cody through.  She sauntered to the stage, taking careful note of Lenny's posture and body language.  Cody wasn't sure if Lenny was happy to see her or not.  She'd been pretty guarded since the wreck and even more reserved in the months leading up to her unexpected departure with a rock band.   What the hell? You're in town and you weren't gonna call me? Cody smiled widely and ignored the fact that Lenny didn't smile in return.   Scott called you? Lenny asked instead, slipping her hands into her back pockets and walking to the edge of the stage.   This would be easier than Cody thought.  The only reason she was here was to keep up appearances anyway.  What kind of a best friend would she be if she didn't at least feign interest in Lenny's life? Besides, if she thought Scott was her source then maybe that meant she was thinking about coming back.   Damn, girl.  When you want to disappear, you do it in style.  Cody didn't answer her question, the same as Lenny had done to her.  She would play every game Lenny wanted to.  She would just do it better.   Cody hopped on the stage and hugged her oldest friend.  Their relationship had always been complicated, but Cody had never found anyone who could truly replace Lenny.  She was one of a kind.  Perfect Lenny, with her perfect hair and her perfect teeth and her perfect life.  She was so. . . perfect.             Mike watched Lenny talking to her friend from his usual place behind the drums.  Was it just him or did Lenny look a little stiff? He shifted on his stool and saw Sway texting out of the corner of his eye.   Who you talking to? He asked.  It wasn't any of his business and normally he could care less who Sway was talking to, but Mike was feeling curious today.   A girl, Sway mumbled.  You don't know her.   Mike frowned.  Sway didn't give his number out to girls.  Weird.   She a friend? Mike was actually pushing.  He seriously didn't even want to know, he didn't know why he was asking.   Yeah, dude, she's a friend.  Why do you care? Sway looked up in exasperation.   I don't, Mike rubbed his hand down his face and turned away.   Whatever, man.  I really wish you'd get over it.   Mike glared at Sway whose head was bent back to his phone.  He wanted to yell at him, curse him, tell him to shut up but he couldn't.  Sway was right, Mike was acting paranoid.  Again.  Private conversations always set him on edge.   He knew being on the road would make him jumpy after a while.  The stress and the travel and all the crap that somehow goes along with it.  Having Luke around helped.  A lot.  But being alone still sucked.  And now that Luke and Lenny had finally kissed. . . kind of solidified his forsaken nature once again.   Why did he care who Sway was talking to? Because he knew who he was hoping it was. . .  But it wasn't.  And it never would be again.   Mike looked up to see Lenny approaching with her friend.  He really didn't feel like meeting new people today but Lenny meant a lot to him so he'd attempt his best behavior.  Fake it till you make it, right?  This is my friend, Cody.  Lenny introduced with a tight smile.   Mike shook the girl's hand and ignored the once over he received.  He wasn't interested.  She seemed nice enough and being Lenny's friend, she probably was.  Mike just wasn't that guy.   Sway was overt in his praise of the new girl and Mike found himself backing away from the group ever so subtly.  Lenny caught his eye and they exchanged what he could only describe as a painful look.  She didn't want Cody there either.  And she needed an ally.  Mike sighed inwardly; he could be that for Lenny.  It might give him something to focus on besides the turmoil.   I'll stick around.  Cody was nodding her head.  Someone's got to fill you in on this chick, she elbowed Lenny in the ribs.  I bet she hasn't told you any of the good stuff.   Mike wondered where the hell Lenny had connected up with this girl.  She was like the night to Lenny's day.  And Lenny looked like she was going to lose her lunch.  He looked around at the rest of the guys, why didn't they see whatever it was he was picking up on? Why did stuff like this always fall on him to fix?            So what's the deal with you and the guys? Have you hooked up with any of them? Cody was trying to get Lenny to open up a bit more.  She was being particularly cagey.  Even for Lenny.  They had covered the Ashton mess, Lenny coming to Aspen and life on the road.  All that was left was Lenny's love life.   Cody! Lenny exclaimed, looking around the sound booth nervously.  No! I work for them and they're my friends.   C'mon, Luke Casey has a bangin' bod.  Totally doable.  She saw Greg look over his shoulder at her and she winked.   Please stop.  Lenny was blushing uncontrollably at this point and Cody realized that nothing in that department had changed.  Good to know.   Frickin' virgin, Cody smirked.  You have got to loosen up, babe.  She took out her phone and tapped out a short text to Shane.  For a guy who claimed he didn't care if Lenny had moved on, he definitely needed a lot of reassurance.   Can we not talk about that? Lenny pinched the bridge of her nose and Cody wondered if maybe she was taking it too far.  The headaches hadn't been an issue until after the accident but Cody always seemed to be trigger.  Or maybe it was talk about sex in general that made Lenny's head hurt.   Sure.  Cody sighed.  When are you coming home? It was the question of the year.  When would Lenny return to the mountain and claim it as her own again? Cody found it hard to believe that Lenny could give it up altogether, not when she had so easily dominated.   Maybe for Christmas.  Lenny replied, relaxing again at the subject change.   I saw Duke last week, he misses you.  Cody swallowed the gag that wanted to surface.  Those two had always had a much closer relationship than she cared for.  She still didn't know why Duke had decided to mentor Lenny over his own niece but whatever.  Cody didn't need anyone's help anyway.  She'd proved that by winning the gold medal, hadn't she?  The lights dropped and the show started and Cody felt relieved that the 'catching-up' was over for the most part.  Being with Lenny was exhausting.  Trying to anticipate what may or may not upset her got old quick.  Cody wished they could go back to being kids, when things weren't so complex.   She would stick around after the show for a bit and fish for information.  If Lenny had remembered anything surrounding the circumstances of the accident, it was sure to be obvious during a session of sentimental reminiscing.  And she really wanted to know if Lenny was considering a comeback anytime soon.             Lenny was doubled over in laughter.  She couldnt breathe at all and sat down on the floor to try to catch her breath.  But Cody wasnt going to let her off that easy.  She kept going with her story, even as Lenny tried to wave a time-out at her with her hands.   So, Lenny, brilliant as she is, decides we need something edgy to do for the talent show.  I went along with it because, well, lets face it, shes amazing and I trusted her.   Lenny was wiping away her tears as Cody brought back some of her best memories.  Pre-accident memories.   She convinces me that we should sing and dance to Salt N Pepas 'Shoop. ' She paused as the room exploded in laughter, then continued.  No, seriously.  We practiced for weeks, learning all the words and the dance routine.  We were so proud of ourselves.  She smiled at Lenny.  Keep in mind, this was a private school that our parents paid thousands of dollars a year for us to attend.   What happened? Harrison asked, wide-eyed.   We got kicked out.  Cody said flatly.  We didnt even make it through the first chorus and Mrs.  K shut off the power.   Lenny was finally catching her breath when Cody dove right in to another story from her past that she hadnt thought about in a long time.  Maybe she shouldn't have dreaded seeing her friend after all.  This could work.             The guys had a lot of questions and Cody was more than happy to give detailed answers.  She wasn't even a tiny bit surprised that there were five dudes drooling all over Lenny.  It was typical.  Lenny always had to have all the boys to herself.   What about the nickname Freebird? Blake nodded a question at Cody.  Where did that come from?  You havent told them anything, have you? Cody accused Lenny playfully.   Lenny shook her head but kept smiling.  Another thing that hadn't changed from the accident, Lenny didn't talk about snowboarding.  And the fake humility was a nice touch.   Um, let me think, when did that start? She looked up at the ceiling as if trying to remember.  We were in high school, Lenny was starting to gain some attention for her talent on the mountain.  She sat next to her friend on the floor and leaned her back against the wall.  Lenny was always taking off to go test the powder in remote areas of the world.  The boys at school loved her and were always trying to get with her.  Lenny shook her head to disagree, embarrassment starting to color her neck.  Yes, Sweetie, youve always been hot.  Cody dismissed her silent argument and sighed, But Lenny couldnt be tamed, just like the song.  I think the first time it was used publicly though it was Shane Brookings, was it not? She looked to Lenny for verification.  Lenny bit the inside of her cheek and shrugged.  Cody chose her next words carefully.   Yeah, it was.  Shane was doing an interview with ESPN and they asked who he thought had the most potential in the young crowd that was staring to blaze their trail on the mountain.  And he said, Lenny Freebird Evans, that girl can fly.   Thats a pretty hefty endorsement.  Isnt that guy like, the best? Mike asked.  Cody narrowed her eyes at him.  He had been paying way to close attention and she didn't trust him.   She forced a laugh in response, Yeah, he basically rules the effing sport.   Lenny was quiet; she was still smiling but had calmed down considerably.  Cody watched heedfully, looking for any telltale signs of grief, heartache, regret, etc.  But Lenny was an oak.   And it stuck; announcers and commentators started talking about this amazing new talent and they hardly used her first name anymore.   Why did you say publicly? Was it used before that? Luke asked.   Cody calculated his question.  She knew men and she knew them well.  And it was more than obvious to her that Luke not only wanted Lenny but he also wanted to protect her.  How in the hell does she always make that happen? Hottest guy in the room and he's her frickin' lap dog.   I started calling her that in high school every time she turned down another poor boy that had fallen desperately in love with her.  I had mentioned it to Shane the first time we met him.  Remember that? She elbowed Lenny.  He kept trying to flirt with Lenny but she wasnt having it.  So I explained that she was a free bird and she wasnt gonna be caged.  She smiled at Lenny with mischief.  Shane liked it so much he got a tattoo of it on his bicep.   Luke might as well know the truth.  If he's going to be her whipping boy he should know he's not the only one.   Whoa! Some dude got your name tattooed on his arm for you? Sway gaped.   No, it wasnt my name, it was a nickname and also a famous song.  It really had nothing to do with me.  Lennys expression was nonchalant and she waved it off.  Cody pursed her lips before changing the subject.  The seeds had been planted, the rest was their fault.   Remember that time Duke got stuck in the tree? Cody asked Lenny whose eyes widened at the memory.   Yes! I still cant believe he did that.  She said, shaking her head.   What happened? Harrison egged on.   Okay, Duke, my crazy uncle who taught Lenny everything she knows, he prefers to find his own line.   Whats a line? Sway was confused.   The line is the track you take down the snow to get to the bottom.  Lenny explained.   Anyway, Cody continued.  We had gotten way up in to the backwoods area that is seldom run and decided to be a little more risky with our chutes.  Codys eyes sparkled with humor at the memory.  The rule has always been: if you can see the bottom, follow Dukes line; if you cant see the bottom, do not follow Duke.   Lenny started to giggle again but tried to keep it quiet so that Cody could finish telling the best part.   Duke took this wild line down the hill and instead of following the open area where he could clearly see what was coming; he veered to the left and went over this small ridge.  Well, he thought it was small.  Cody paused to let Lenny laugh heartily, everyone's eyes were wide in anticipation.  Turns out, it was this huge cliff that dropped into nothingness and he ended up in a tree.   It was really fortunate that tree was there, Lenny pointed out.  He couldve gotten really hurt, otherwise.   Who? Duke? Cody rolled her eyes, That guy is invincible; hell out live us all.  She turned to Lenny, You should really call him.  Seriously, Lenny, Cody let out her aggravation.  No one loves you more, not even your own parents.  The least you could do is give him a call and tell him youre okay.   Fine, Ill call him.  Lenny conceded with frustration in her voice.  Youre right, he deserves better.   Cody put her arm around Lennys neck and hugged her close.  Thank you.  Itll be good for you, too, ya know.  And now they all knew that Lenny abandoned those closest to her.  Zing.   They continued to visit for another hour and then Cody leaned over and kissed the top of Lennys head.  I have to go, Bird.  I have an early morning appointment.  She stood up and Lenny joined her.   Hey, call me if you need anything.  Cody looked into Lennys face with a serious expression.  Ill see you in Aspen.  Cody paused.  Or maybe at the Lodge if you decide to go home for Christmas.   Lenny nodded but didnt speak.  Cody left feeling satisfied with her visit.  They were obviously still friends which meant that the memory lapse around the accident was still intact.  Shane always worried for no reason.  Now if Cody could just convince Lenny to come back to competing, maybe she could find out once and for all who was actually the best.             The next few days all sort of blurred together for Luke.  They had a show every night so they were pretty much on the bus nonstop.  Anytime he and Lenny had a free moment they would make out like high schoolers.  In the back of the bus, behind the bleachers, in the dark behind the venue.  And every night, he would sing his song to her, hoping she would fall for him just a little bit more.   The weirdness from Cody's visit had passed but it had taken a few days.  Luke had noticed Lenny's distance but didn't confront it.  He wouldn't even have known where to start.  He and Mike had had a conversation that left Luke feeling leery of Cody and unsure of how to address it.  How do you tell someone that their best friend is a poison in their life? Besides, he was having too much fun with Lenny to want to spoil it.   The excitement of sneaking around was new for Luke.  His past relationships had all been very public and nearly completely physical.  Not this time.  They talked about everything, all the time.  The only one he had ever shared so much with was Mike.  But Luke was still very aware of how gun-shy Lenny had been even recently.  He wasnt going to push for anything more than what they had right now.  He liked her and she liked him.   And the kissing was fantastic.   Luke was making his way to sound check, his standard grin plastered on his face from having just spent the most amazing three minutes with Lenny in the back lounge of the bus.  He jumped when Ashton stepped out in front of him.   Shit! He said, startled, his smile gone.  He stepped past her and continued on.   Ashton looked annoyed at being blown off and ran to catch up to him.   I need to talk to you, Luke.  She tried to get his attention.   No you dont, Ashton.  Luke frowned straight ahead.   Im sorry for what I did to Lenny and I want to make it up to you.   Luke kept marching forward without pause.   Ashtons voice was getting desperate as they neared the stage.   I know that shes your friend and youre really mad at me but I want to make things better so we can go back to what we had.  They had made it to the stage area and everyone was watching as Ashton nervously spit her words out.  Her voice was getting shriller and she was starting to cause a scene.  We need to fix this, baby! Youre just not your best self without me!  Luke stopped in his tracks and turned his scowl on her.  Im going to be as clear with you as possible, Ashton.  His voice was low and gravelly.  We, he pointed to her and himself.  No longer exist.  That ended a long time ago and never should've happened in the first place.   We had a fight, Luke! Thats what couples do, but we can still make it work.   No, Ashton! We are not a couple.  Lukes voice was growing in volume.   But, baby-!  You have to listen to me! I dont like you! Lukes voice was sharp.   The arena went dead quiet and Luke felt all eyes on the commotion at center stage.   Ashton wasnt giving up that easy.  She tried to reach for Lukes hand but he stepped back, away from her.   I know you still have feelings for me! Ashton shouted, she was forcing the issue.  In the past, when Ashton wanted her way she threatened to make a public spectacle, knowing it made Luke uncomfortable and he would give in to get her to shut up.  That song you sing for encore every night, I know that youre singing it to me!  Ashton, you wanna know the truth? Okay, here it is.  I never had feelings for you.  Never.  I was lonely and you were convenient.  I feel bad about that, I really do, but Im a different person now.  Youre the same person.  Youre shallow, vapid and cruel.  Youre mean to me and my friends and your own employees.  The song I sing every night is for someone who is the exact opposite of you.  Shes amazing and sweet and Im crazy in love with her.   Ashtons mouth fell open.  The guitar techs nodded their approval.  Ashton reached for Luke again and again he pulled away and shook his head at her.  She turned in a huff and left the stage.  The onlookers broke in to applause.             Lennys stomach felt like she had gone over a hill.  Her head was a little foggy, maybe she misheard.  Maybe Luke hadnt actually just announced that he loved her to the entire band and crew.  She took a breath and focused on trying to stop her hands from shaking.  Okay, she thought reasonably, he didnt actually say my name.  No one else knows hes talking about me.  That only offered a few seconds of comfort because the next thought was Luke just said he was in love with me.   She decided to not overreact.  She could handle this.  Obviously, there was going to be a rational explanation and Luke would tell her later.  She went about the rest of her night trying to behave as normally as possible.   Ashtons set was a blur, Double Blind Study was outstanding.  Luke took his seat during the encore and sang his song to Lenny, the one he had written for her.  He sounded almost desperate, urgent.  She couldnt tell because she wasnt looking at him.  She wanted to, it was just that the lights seemed particularly bright from her seat.   After the set finished, she headed back to the bus and turned on the TV, looking for anything to distract her and get her brain working properly again.   Mike and Luke entered the bus, joking and laughing, acting like everything was normal.  Lenny did her best to participate in the conversation.  She knew they were talking to her but she wasn't paying attention to what they were saying.  She was answering mechanically.  After an hour or so, Mike excused himself to bed and Lenny and Luke were alone.   He moved over to sit next to her on the couch and she stiffened.  He gave her a gentle smile and reached over to hold her hand.  She didnt pull away but she did flinch a little.   Hey, Lukes voice was a soothing balm on Lennys frayed nerves.  I only said that to get Ashton off my back.   Lenny let out her breath like a deflated balloon.   I know.  She lied, still trying to appear fine.   Luke chuckled, No you didnt, you were totally freaked out.   She smiled then, Was it that obvious?  Yes.  Luke confirmed.  But dont worry, Im not saying that yet.   I dont know how I feel and-  Neither do I.  Luke cut her off.  Really, it was just to make a point to Ashton.  His eyes were pleading with Lenny to believe him.   She folded into his arms and he held her close.  Weirdly, she felt better believing that he wasn't actually in love with her.  She loved the feel of his strong embrace and smell of his aftershave as she leaned against him.  The anxiety she had been feeling all night had completely disappeared in his arms.  She didnt know what that meant, and she refused to try to define it or examine it.             Luke and Lenny spent every spare moment together.  They joked around with the familiarity of old friends and when no one else was around, they were kissing.  Lenny started to go through Chap Stick a lot faster and it made her smile to know she had a secret reason for that.  What she wasnt thinking about was all the things she was putting off.  She used her secret fling with Luke as an excuse to not fulfill her promise to Cody to call Duke.  She didnt want to have that conversation.   They had wrapped up the last show on this leg of the tour and the bus got stuck in a snowstorm on its way back to Chicago.  They had made it to a truck stop but the drivers announced that it would be too dangerous to continue, they would have to wait for the roads to clear.  It was fortunate that it happened that way and they didnt have to cancel or postpone any shows.   The band members gathered in the Blue Bus and were playing various games and having a few laughs.  They toasted to a successful tour, they toasted to no one killing Ashton and they toasted to the promise of a successful overseas tour after the break.   Are you coming with us? Blake asked Lenny in regards to the overseas tour starting at the end of January.   I dont see why not.  Lenny raised her eyebrows, Unless you dont want me around anymore?  No, we voted last night.  It was unanimous, you have to come with us.  Harrison said from the back of the bus, joining them.   Lenny nodded, knowingly.  She smiled at the rag tag group of dudes who had become her family over the past couple of months.  She couldnt picture not being with them.   Are you going home for Christmas? Sway asked.   I think I should, yeah.  Lenny admitted.  It was strange how things had changed so much for her and how different she felt.  When this tour had started she had expected to end up in a different town with a different life.  But now she was thinking that maybe she should salvage the life she already had.  If she still could.   What about you guys, where do you go for the holidays? Lenny asked.   Well all head home to Boston.  Mike explained, Its where our families live.  He nodded fractionally at Luke who looked down and rubbed his brow line casually.   Lenny knew so much more was said between them in that moment than she would ever understand.  What must it be like to not have a family to go home to? But to have a friend so close that you know you belong in their family events without the verbal invitation? Lenny's heart hurt at the thought of Luke being alone for the holidays.  And she suddenly felt very selfish for having avoided her own for so long.   Except Blake, Sway interrupted her thoughts, pulling her back to the conversation.  He goes home with Harrison.   Lenny frowned, waiting for the explanation.   I'm not from Boston.  Blake glared at Sway.   Can we still come with you to the X-Games? Harrison asked suddenly, changing the subject.   Of course, Lenny said, a little confused by the question.  Wasnt that the plan?  Harrison breathed a sigh of relief, I was afraid you were going to change your mind.  You can get pretty elusive when it comes to you other life.   Lenny chuckled, Thats true, I suppose.   She thought about it for a minute and realized that the guys would be totally out of their element in Aspen.  They were used to being the rock stars, she wondered how they would fair being regular civilians.  It was true, they would be recognized and some people would probably ask for autographs but she knew that there was a whole other reason for the crowds.   It could get weird for you guys, you know.  She thought she might try to prepare them.   Oh, we know.  Mike grinned.  The roles will have flipped: well be your assistants.   Lenny felt a tinge of apprehension.  It must have showed on her face because Luke rested his hand reassuringly on her thigh.  She looked at him and his expression quieted her mind instantaneously.  She loved how just looking at him had such a powerful effect on her.   You guys gonna be okay during break, being separated and all? Sway addressed Lenny and Luke.  The room laughed at their startled expressions.   What do you mean? Luke tried to play it off and be cool.   Seriously? Sway raised his eyebrows at where Lukes hand was resting familiarly on Lennys thigh.   Yeah, its the worst kept secret around, guys.  Blake prodded.   Lenny blushed and looked down.   I dont know what youre talking about.  Luke obviously knew he was caught but kept trying to signal the guys to drop it.  Were friends, what?  Yeah, okay.  Sway said sarcastically, deliberately ignoring Lukes attempt to deflect the truth.   Luke looked to Mike for help but he shrugged.   Its really okay, guys.  Blake said.  Weve known for a while.   Known what for a while? Luke continued to play dumb.  Lenny smiled at how he was trying and she knew it was only to make her comfortable.   Yes, Lenny finally said.  We are a little bit closer than just friends but were not labeling it right now.   Frickin' hipsters, Blake snorted.  Fine, Ill label it for you.  Perfect for each other, there! Was that so frickin' hard?  Lenny didnt know what to say after that.  Luke smiled at his friends.  Leave it to them to take something to a whole new level.  He squeezed Lennys leg and chuckled low in his chest.   How long have you guys known? Lenny asked them.   Since Denver.  Blake answered, surprising both Luke and Lenny.   How? Lenny was perplexed; she thought they had been careful.   Well, it was kind of obvious.  I mean, Lenny had needed a good kiss for a while.  Why do you think I was always asking to make out? Sway joked.   Yeah, you were both suddenly very happy.  Blake winked at Lenny.   Lenny shook her head and smiled.  She was afraid they wouldnt approve but that wasnt the case at all.  Carl might be a different story.   So, you guys gonna see each other before Aspen? Sway asked again.  The reason Im asking is because it is gonna be weird not having you around for like, two weeks.   Lenny shrugged, I guess we hadnt really talked about it.  She looked at Luke who was beaming at her.  I talked to Scott the other day and I decided to stay at the Lodge with Duke and see if I can talk him into joining us for dinner on Christmas Day.   Have you even talked to him yet? Mike asked.   Lenny clenched her jaw slightly.  No.  I was gonna surprise him.  She tried to clear the emotion from her throat.   Whats the deal with you guys anyway? Harrison asked.  I mean, I get hes like your Miyagi and all but why the avoidance?  It was a legitimate question.  One that Lenny didnt really have a legitimate answer for.  Duke had been more than just a mentor.  He was the only one who had truly supported her in everything.  They had a similar spirit and drive, hating the social norm and rebelling against the standard.  She never had to explain things to him, he already knew.  Even when she decided to be more conventional and pursued qualification in the Olympics, he supported her.  But she knew he didnt agree.  He thought her best lines were made in the back country, amidst the unpredictable elements.   She felt like she had let him down more than anyone.  She became too cocky, ignored her instincts and thats what really caused her to lose control out of the chute.  How was she supposed to talk to him now? What could she say?  I guess I just wouldnt know what to say.  Lennys words sounded lame even to her.  She looked at her hands in her lap and picked at a stray thread on her jeans.   You want me to come with you? Lukes voice was so sincere and full of concern that it made Lenny feel even worse about her actions.   No, I think it would better if I see Duke alone at first.  Besides, if hes mad, I dont really want to get yelled at in front of you guys.  She smiled, indicating she was half-joking.   You think hell yell at you? Blake questioned.   Trust me, I deserve it.  Lenny rolled her eyes, So much you dont know.  An idea came to her then, Hey, you guys wanna come out for New Years? We can chill at the Lodge for a couple days and then all fly to Aspen together.             They all exchanged glances, thinking similar thoughts.  Lenny was so elusive about her past; she would never really talk about herself openly.  Now suddenly, shes inviting them to her home in the backwoods of Wyoming for a major holiday.  This was such a big step that they agreed without much thought.   Lenny relaxed against Lukes side then, leaning her head onto his shoulder.  Luke squeezed her leg again and smiled faintly.  The guys resumed their video game session and Luke let his thoughts wander.  He was concerned about Lenny but couldnt explain it.  He knew there were issues she still wasnt dealing with and he wasnt sure if she trusted him enough to let him help her through it.  Being on the road had its advantages of keeping them separated from real life and he knew how jarring a return to the norm could be.  Especially for someone who was running away from their reality.  He tried not to let his concern cloud his mind, but a fear was lurking he couldnt seem to shake completely.             Cody: she's coming to Aspen      Shane: are you sure?      Cody: yes, don't be a baby about it      Shane: don't be a jealous bitch, Cody      Cody: you're such a dick      Shane: at least I'm not fake       10    The Outsiders      Snow had started to fall as Lenny approached the Lodge.  She was always amazed by its massive beauty, no matter how many times she had seen it.  It was enormous, with a wooden and stone structure, perfectly nestled into the mountainside with an expansive view of the range from the back.   She hadn't planned on coming up until tomorrow, but after dinner with her parents and a disconcerting conversation with her father about Duke's whereabouts, she had felt a rush to check on him sooner rather than later.  She knew she was worrying unreasonably.  He was a grown man and had no trouble taking care of himself.  But, then again, most of their relationship had been fairly irrational.   Lenny parked her old Bronco in the drive, not bothering with the garage door.  She grabbed her duffel and started up the walkway.  When she opened the front door, all the interior lights were off.   Hello? She called into the darkness.  She reached for the switch on the wall by the door, flicking it on.   Hello? She called again, stomping the snow off her shoes and slipping them off before leaving the foyer.   Duke? She called into the living room, but received no answer.  She traveled through the empty area and into a smaller den off to the side.  She flicked the light switch, but the room was empty.  She backtracked and went through an adjacent door leading to the kitchen.  The floor to ceiling windows faced the west, and the sun was beginning to set, giving the illusion that the stainless steel appliances were made of pure gold.  But it was also void of human presence.   Lenny touched his cellphone on the counter and picked up her pace across the granite floor and sprinted up the stairs leading to the bedroom area.  She saw a light on in Dukes room at the end of the hall and she breathed a sigh of relief.  He's here.  She slowed to a walk, her socked feet silent on the wood floors as she came to the open doorway.   Duke was sitting with his back against the headboard, reading a book.  His thick, dark hair matched his full beard, making him look older than he really was.  Lenny smiled at his red flannel pajamas, a mountain man to a fault.  He was wearing reading glasses and his lips moved just noticeably with the words as he read.  Lenny leaned her body against the door frame, watching quietly.   A million different emotions began to toy with her heart and she felt its pace quicken the longer the silence continued.  She hadn't been fair to him.  Of all the people she had been trying to escape, Duke should have never been on that list.   Its kinda early to get ready for bed, isnt it? She finally asked into the stillness.   Duke didnt even look up.  Nope.  He continued reading.   Lenny swallowed; she knew she deserved the cold shoulder.  She slowly slid down the door frame and pressed her back against it, bringing her knees up to rest her arms on them.   Im sorry I didnt call, Duke.  She said trying to keep the tremble out of her voice.   Duke turned the page in his book and kept reading.  Lenny sighed and leaned her head back.   I made up your bed for you.  Duke broke the silence but still didnt look up.   Lenny felt a smile start at the corners of her mouth and her heart started to make the long climb from the floor back to its proper place in her chest.  How did you know I would be here?  The wind told me.   Lenny chuckled softly, Scott told you I was coming, didnt he? She shook her head as realization swept over her.  You werent missing, you guys planned this.   I have no idea what you are talking about.  Duke kept his tone even and conversational.   I was really worried about you, you know.  Lenny tried to make him feel bad even though she knew he wouldnt.  She didn't have a right to that anyway.   Duke finally closed the book and put it down on the nightstand, giving Lenny his full attention.  She shifted uncomfortably from her seat on the floor.  Maybe this is where shed finally get lectured, she had it coming and she knew it.             Did your mom send any of her chili with you?  Lenny frowned, confused.  What? How didno, what?  Duke stood up and shuffled past her and down the hall.  He turned to see if she was coming.  She pushed herself to her feet and followed him down the stairs and into the kitchen.  Duke opened the fridge and started to pull out ingredients for a sandwich.   Here, let me do that.  Lenny took the packages of lunch meat out of his hands and gently shoved him out of the way.  Duke made a satisfied grunting noise and meandered over to one of the stools against the counter facing Lenny.   As she sliced cheese and tomatoes, he watched her movements closely.  Her hands were steady, theyd lost the tremble she had the last time he had seen her.  She moved deftly around the kitchen, like she hadnt been away at all, remembering where each and every thing was kept.  Her hair was loose and more than halfway down her back, very different from the tight braid she had insisted on after the wreck.  Her cheeks were a healthy pink and she had put on some muscle, filling out the sunken places the accident had left her with two years ago.   Duke rested his elbow on the counter and put his bearded chin in his palm, rubbing his whiskers above his lips.  Six months, thats how long it had been since he had last spoken with Lenny.  Six months ago she ran off with rock stars and scared him nearly half to death.  And now she was suddenly back, making him a sandwich in the kitchen in the home they had shared for five odd years.   How long you staying this time? He asked gruffly.  He noticed she winced just a bit but she looked up at him and met his eyes.   Through the New Yearthen I have to go to Aspenthen on to Europe for the end of the tour.  She placed the perfectly structured sandwich in front of him.   What happens after Europe? Duke sunk his teeth into the thick, wheat bread.  It was perfection.  He hadnt had a sandwich this good in a long time.   Im not really sure She came around the counter and sat on the stool next to him.  He swiveled slightly so he was angled toward her.   Duke chewed thoughtfully for a few minutes.  When do I get to meet the guy? He tried not to smile at Lennys surprised expression.   What? Lenny blushed and she tried to fight the dopey grin that wanted to commandeer her face.  What guy? What are you talking about?  Cmon, Lenny, dont bullshit with me.   How did you know there was a guy? She narrowed her eyes at Duke.   Don't insult my intelligence.  Of course there's a guy.  No other reason why youd have that dumb grin on your face.   How are you not mad at me? Lenny frowned at him, perplexed.   I was mad at first.  But I got over it.  Duke finished his sandwich and rubbed the crumbs out of his whiskers.  Dont change the subject, which one was it? The drummer? The guitarist? He studied her coy expression.  Nahyoure too flashy for that, you went for the lead singer, didnt ya?  Lennys eyes widened and she smacked his shoulder.  Flashy?  Duke chuckled, I knew it.   She shook her head, her hair falling over her face, hiding her expression.  Were still working out the kinks, its all very new.   Whats his name?  Luke Casey.  Lenny couldn't hide the grin as she said it and Duke chuckled.   Geez, you got it bad.  Duke shook his head in mock disappointment.  Is he coming for New Year's?  How do you already know everything? Lenny exclaimed.  Seriously, are you spying on me?  Duke chuckled again, I told you, I know you better than anyone.  He looked out the big windows and watched the sun slip completely behind the mountain line.  Well, I hope hes better than the last guy you brought home.   Shane was nice.  Lenny chastised seriously.   He was an idiot.  All caught up in the technical.  Duke let out a tiny belch.   You just didnt like his style.  Lenny quietly defended.   What style? The guy was afraid to even try fresh pow.  Besides, who has more style than me? Duke raised his eyebrows and pointed to his red flannel pajamas.   Lenny laughed, You're right, no one compares to you.   Damn straight.  Duke gave a satisfied grunt.   He watched her as she gazed out across the last few flashes of orange sunlight shooting through the clouds.  He willed her to soak in the calm climate of the the home they had created together.  Could it be the refuge that they had planned so long ago? Could she finally feel safe again?  Her face had lost its pinch, her eyes were soft in the low light and she wasn't nearly as jumpy as she had been a few months prior.  Duke felt a combination of elation and heaviness settle over him.  She was better, but still not whole.   Well, Duke stood up and scratched his belly.  Im going to bed, I have a five am alarm set to get out there.   Youre not coming to the house for Christmas? Lenny asked.   Nah, youre the only gift I need.  He reached over and messed up her hair.  She pushed his hand away and pulled her head back, laughing.  A full, hearty laugh, like when she was a kid.   Duke moved toward the stairs but turned around before ascending them.   Im glad youre back.  Even if it is only for a little while.  He said sincerely, wanting to say more but finding the timing all wrong.   Lenny smiled faintly, I am too.             After Duke went to bed, Lenny went into the foyer and grabbed her duffel and headed upstairs to her third floor bedroom.   When she had first purchased the Lodge years ago it had come fully furnished, which had been a major appeal to her since she really didn't have the patience or eye for interior decorating.  Her mother, on the other hand, had taken it upon herself to completely gut the furnishings and start fresh.  She had said that Lenny's home should be a reflection of Lenny herself.  Lenny had agreed mostly because she really didn't care, and also, she wasn't sure she'd be able to talk her mother out of it.   What had transpired that summer still amazed Lenny to this day.  She was ever thankful that she had let her mother have free reign over the decorating process.  Kelli Evans had simplified everything.  Creating the perfect, comforting atmosphere that made Lenny feel at home despite the massive size of the estate.  Every room was modest yet elegant, a symbol of Lenny's riding style.  But out of all the rooms in the house, her bedroom was her favorite.   The entire third floor was a master suite.  Floor to ceiling windows covered the westward facing wall with a majestic view of the Tetons.  A King-size bed with heavy, down comforters that had always kept Lenny warm despite the subzero temperatures of a Wyoming winter was centered against the east wall.  Her walk-in closet could have been another bedroom in and of itself and it was adjacent to her equal sized bathroom which boasted a shower and full-size bath tub.  The walls were adorned with original paintings done by her grandmother when she had been a younger woman.   Lenny slung her duffel into the purple armchair facing the small gas fireplace and sighed.  She didn't need to turn on any lights in the main room as she changed for bed due to the brilliance of the full moon coming through her windowed wall.  She was looking forward to sleeping in her own bed again, and actually sleeping.  The stress dreams and muscle aches had stayed largely absent since. . . well, since that first kiss.   Lenny touched her lips absentmindedly and smiled.  Luke Casey's kisses had a powerful effect indeed.  She snuggled under the heavy covers and checked her cellphone.  One new text.  She bit her lower lip as she opened the message.   Luke: I miss you already.  It's crazy since I just saw you a few hours ago.  I hope this week goes fast.  Merry Christmas, Lenny.   She tapped out her reply and placed the phone on the nightstand.  Pulling the covers up to her chin she smiled into the starlit bedroom.  Homecoming had never felt so sweet.             Duke slept restlessly.  He tossed and turned most of the night before he finally got up way too early and made himself some breakfast.  He watched the mountains wake up in the chilled sunshine and contemplated changing his morning plans.  He would be thirty-six next month and it was Christmas after all.  Maybe it was time to do more 'grownup' things.   He washed his breakfast dishes and started a pot of coffee.  Now that Bird was home he was going to have to get back in the habit of making extra again.  He rubbed his hand down the front of his face and tugged on his beard.  Except she wouldn't be staying for long.  Maybe he should go with her to Christmas dinner at her folks' house.   He shook his head in silent disagreement.  He didn't think he could get along with Scott for that long of a time frame.  And she should really be with her family for the holiday.  He hadn't ever fit into that mix.  No, he would spend the day with his first and only true loves.  The mountain and the board.  His mistress and his passion.   He jogged up the stairs lightly, being careful not to disturb the other house guest.  He needed to get changed and get out of there as soon as possible.  If Lenny asked him to change his plans, he would.  He struggled with telling her 'no. '  That girl always managed to turn his world upside down.             Lenny closed the door to the cold world outside and looked up the open staircase of the home she had grown up in.  Mom had the place completely decked out in holiday festooning.  Lights, ornaments, wreathes and ribbons hung from every doorway, railing and light fixture.  The air was thick with cinnamon and opulence.  Lenny took off her scarf and hung it on the hook, she slipped her jacket off and placed it in the closet.   Auntie!  Lenny was suddenly accosted by four little boys, all under the age of eight.  They surrounded her and hugged her while she struggled to stay upright.  She finally gave in and collapsed on the floor, laughing.   Boys! Their mother, Felicity, clapped at them from the top of the stairs.  Let your auntie up.   Lenny hugged each one individually and they ran off into another part of the house.  Felicity had made her way down the steps and embraced her.  She started to guide her towards the kitchen,  Sorry, about that.  Felicity chuckled, They've been pretty excited to see you.   Not a problem, Lenny smiled widely.  She inhaled the delicious aroma of turkey as she entered her mother's state of the art kitchen.   Lenny, you're early! Her mother exclaimed from behind a a stack of pies.  Did Duke come with you?  Um, no.  He said last night that he wanted to get out there early and I heard him take the sled when I woke up.   I never see that man when there's snow cover.  Kelli muttered more to herself than anyone else.   Geez, ma, you think you got enough pies? Lenny teased her tiny mother.  Kelli Evans was only five feet tall but made up for her lack of height with extra spunk.  Lenny had gotten her father's tallness but otherwise could have been a carbon copy of her mother, same blonde hair, same dark blue eyes.   I hope so.  Kelli answered seriously, eyeballing the tower of pies arranged on a tiered pie stand.  We ran out last year, you know.  It was awful, your father cried.   Lenny snickered at her mom and made her way to the stove top to get herself some apple cider.   Len, dinner won't be ready for a while yet, do you think you and Nathan can take those little boys outside and burn off some energy?  I would love nothing more.  Lenny smiled and drained her cider.  She went in search of Nathan to challenge him to a snow fort building competition.  They each claimed two of the little boys for their team.  In a matter of minutes they were all suited up and out in the cold.   While the four rambunctious boys started to build their piles of snowballs in their finished forts for the eminent fight, Nathan and Lenny had a little heart to heart.   Im really glad you could make it home for Christmas.  He looked at the house.  I wasnt freaked that you took off, I totally understood.  They have always set the bar a little higher for you than the rest of us.   Lenny nodded, Yeah, I shouldve done it differently but I am glad I got away for a while.  It really helped to put some things in perspective.   You ever think youll go back out there? Nathan nodded to the mountains in the distance.   I dont know.  Lenny answered honestly.   I heard you have a boyfriend.  His eyes twinkled, teasing her.   Lenny rolled her eyes at him.  Its still pretty new.  I dont know what Id call it.  She knew she would have to deflect any discussion of Luke all day.  She wasnt sure what to say.   Well, hes coming up for New Years, right?  Yeah, but the whole band is coming.  All of them.  So its not like a special thing.  Lenny could see that Nathan wasnt buying it.   I dont know, Nate.  She said, exasperated.  I like him and he likes me.  Thats all I have figured out right now, okay?  Okay, but I may have to question the young man on his intentions with my sister.   Lenny hit his coat with her mittened hand.  Stop it! You will not!  Nathan was laughing, delighted that he'd gotten her so riled up.  Oh, now I have to.  He was dodging more smacks from her.  Pretty soon Lenny picked up a snowball and hurled it square in Nathans face.   Snowball fight! One of the little boys yelled and it was instantly a free-for-all.  The air was filled with volleying balls of snow and excited yells.  Lenny and Nathan were ducking and trying to ward off the sudden onslaught.  It was the adults against the kids, they were completely outnumbered.             They clamored into the mud room off the back of the house, Lenny instructing the little boys to take off all their wet clothes before going through grandmas kitchen.  They happily obeyed, satisfied that they had won the snowball fight against their aunt and uncle.   I dont know how you do it, Fe.  Lenny said to her sister in-law as she got herself another cup of hot cider off the stove.   Felicity laughed, Neither do I!  Lenny leaned her back against the warm stove and breathed in the amazing scents in the kitchen.   You ladies sure have been cooking up a storm in here.  It smells so good!  Thanks, Lenna! Would you mind checking the table to see if Scott needs anything? Her mom asked as she scurried down from a step stool with an enormous turkey baster held like a weapon as she headed for the oven.   Lenny nodded and walked onto the dining room.  Mom, wants to know if you need anything else.  She addressed Scott who was pushing the kids table into the corner.   No, I think I have it all.   Kay.  She sipped her cider, studying her tall, older brother.  Where is Simone? She asked about Scotts longtime girlfriend who was always at every holiday.  The photographer he had met in New York a few years ago was tall and willowy with vibrant red hair and a smattering of freckles.  She was noticeably absent this year and no one had mentioned her.  In fact, Lenny hadn't spoken to her since the night before her interview with Carl.   We decided to take a break.  Scott didnt look up from his task.   What does that mean?  Scott straightened up and put his hands on his hips.  She wants something Im not ready for yet.  We decided to take a break and see how we feel after the holidays.   Thats stupid.  Lenny couldnt stop herself from declaring her view point.   Thats your opinion.   Whatever.  Shes too good for you anyway, I cant believe you wont just marry her already.  Its been what, five years of dating?  Scott frowned at his sisters reprimand.  Thats interesting, coming from you.   Whats that supposed to mean? Lenny could feel her neck heating up.   Youve had one boyfriend your whole life and now this thing with the rock star that we all know wont last, and you think you should give relationship advice?  Lenny knew he had a point but it irritated her.  I liked Simone, thats all.   Scott grunted and went upstairs to get more chairs.  Lenny took her cup back to the kitchen and checked to see if they needed her help.  They were fine and sent her out to the den to see her father and other brother, David.   Lenny curled her legs under her and sat on the big leather sofa in front of the fire while her father and David played chess.  What Scott had said about Luke bugged her.  He didnt know if it would last.  How could he? It was still brand new.  Lenny wasnt even sure where it was going.  Maybe that was the problem.   She leaned her head against the arm rest and stared into the fire.  She thought about the guys and the road and how exciting going to Europe would be.  She also thought about Duke and the Lodge and the whole life she had waiting for her here, whenever she decided to rejoin it.  Was there even the possibility of a future with Luke? Wouldnt he just move on to the next girl when the tour was over? Yes, more than likely, thats what made the most sense.  She could just enjoy what little time they had left.  New Year's would be fun.  And Europe would be great too.  But Lenny decided that after Europe she would come home to the Lodge.  She may never snowboard again but she could be close to see her nephews grow and be around if her parents needed her.   It was time to make grownup decisions.   You okay, kiddo? Her father broke into her thoughts.  You look like you're thinking about something pretty hard.   Lenny twisted her head so her chin was on the armrest and she was looking at her dad.  Yeah, just thinking about New Year's.   Your mom and I are leaving for the Caymans tomorrow, you need us to stay?  No, I think Nathan and I have it pretty much handled.  Lenny gave him a small smile.   How is Duke? David asked, making a move on the chess board that caused her father to grunt.   He's the same.  Lenny replied.  Duke really was the same.  Nothing with him ever changed.  She smiled to herself as she thought of him.  Christmas Day and he was out on a run.  This was the first one in a long time where she wasn't sharing it with him and wishing she was.             Duke slowly peeled off his sweater, being careful to not tug on his left shoulder.  He rotated that arm a few times, trying to loosen the tightness that had built up.   You tweak your shoulder again?  Lenny's voice startled him.  He hadn't seen her sitting at the bar when he'd come in the backdoor.   Aren't you supposed to be in town? He ignored her question, continuing to strip out of his wet clothes without grimacing from the pain running through his arm.   Ma sent home some leftovers.  And an entire pie.  Lenny wasn't being fooled.  He saw her watching him closely and irritation shot down his spine.  The last thing he needed was for her to be worried about him.   Can I help you with that? She jumped off the stool and started towards him.   I got it.  Duke didn't mean to snap but that's what had happened.  Lenny wasn't even fazed.  She rolled her eyes and smacked his hand out of the way as she grabbed the bottom of his shirt and tugged it over his head.  Duke didn't have the coordination to fight back even though he knew what would happen next and he wasn't disappointed.  As Lenny dropped his shirt into the pile on the floor, she gasped.   Oh, stop.  Duke growled.  He tried to push past her with the intent of going to his room and closing the door.  But Lenny wasn't having it.   Holy crap, Duke.  Her eyes were wide as they took in the bruises that adorned his torso.  It must have been worse than he had expected by the shocked look on her face.  What the hell happened out there today?  I took a spill.  His mouth crooked up on the side, Maybe a few.   Well, Lenny scrutinized his wounds and he had to fight off the self-conscience feeling washing over him from her careful gaze.  You look terrible.  But, she turned him around and gingerly touched some of the marks, feeling for cracked ribs, I don't think anything is broken.  She gently rubbed his sore shoulder and gauged his reaction.  I don't like that you keep messing this up, you might need to see a doctor one of these days.  She raised her eyebrows at him and her sweet concern made is heart melt.   I'll be fine.  Duke reassured her.  It's not like I've never wrecked before.  He grinned as he hobbled towards the stairs, this time she let him pass.  How about I put some clothes on and you heat me up some of that food you were talking about.  He didn't turn around to see if she would comply, he knew she'd do it.   In his room, Duke surveyed his body in the mirror.  Yep, I do look terrible.  He slipped his arms in a loose button up flannel, only bothering with half the buttons.  His skin still burned from where her fingers had touched him and he silently scolded his anatomy for letting her affect him like that.  He put on some baggy pajama pants and stood before the mirror again.   He gave himself a stern look and let out all the air in his lungs.  Get it together, dumb ass.   He took a few more minutes to clear his head before he made his way back to the kitchen.  Lenny had an impressive spread set out for him on the bar; turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing, gravy, biscuits and green beans.  She was sitting on the counter top across from the bar, her legs dangling.   I thought you said there would be pie.  Duke grumbled as he took his seat.   You can have pie if you finish all of that.  Lenny laughed and Duke relished that sound that had been missing for way too long.  And he knew the credit belonged to someone else.  Not that he hadn't tried, they'd all tried to snap her out of her funk after the wreck but no one could reach her.  Now, she seemed closer than she'd been in ages.   How was the family? He asked between forkfuls.   Good, everyone's happy and healthy.   Scott? Duke looked up in time to see her scrunch her nose.   The usual.   Duke nodded knowingly.  Scott was always harder on Lenny than Duke felt she deserved.  One of the many reasons he couldn't get along with that guy.   What's the plan for New Year's?  Nathan will move up here tomorrow to help me set up.  He has mom's gift for decorating.  She smiled at him crookedly.  I'd really like it if you were here for it.  I really want you to meet all the guys.   I'll be around.  Duke nodded as he took a drink of water.  He knew what she was really asking.  She wanted his approval of the new guy.  He had never approved of Shane and he suspected that was one of the reason's she had stopped talking to him about the important stuff.  Now that things with Shane were over, Duke was back in Lenny's confidence. . . for the most part.             Lenny went through her closet and packed what she would need for Aspen and then packed a separate suitcase for Europe.  She was glad she would be able to bring some fresh clothes for the second leg of the tour.  No hasty packing this time around.   Duke had been out on the mountain daily since she'd come home.  Every night before he went to bed he asked Lenny if she wanted to come with him in the morning.  She always said no.  She wasn't ready for that.  She might not ever be.   She busied herself preparing for her guests.  The upstairs had several single bedrooms and one large room with six bunks in it.  She made sure all the sheets were clean and all the bathrooms were fully stocked.  It was weirdly similar to her job on the road.   Every night, she and Duke would sit by the fire and visit.  She didn't get personal and neither did he.  But it was soothing and Lenny enjoyed the knowledge that no matter how far away she went or how long she was gone, she would be able to come home to Duke's solid presence.  His loyalty never wavered.        11    Tensioning      Duke stared into the fire, just a simple conversation, he thought.  It shouldn't be that hard.  You guys used to talk all the time.  He didn't look up as Lenny entered the room and handed him a mug of homemade hot chocolate.  One more thing he was going to have to miss in a week.   She'd only been home for a few days and she had easily settled into their old routines; cooking all his favorite winter comfort foods, cleaning up his wet clothes after a day's run, going into town for gas for the sled.  She wouldn't go out on any runs with him, but he never stopped asking.  He knew there was still so much more to say, to talk about.  Too many things were getting ignored and he wasn't even sure where to start.   When does their plane get in tomorrow? Duke asked instead.  That was another thing that he was trying hard to come to terms with.  The guy who had set her world right again was going to be in his, er, her home the very next night.  He had no idea how far this little relationship had gone, but he wasn't going to be cool with them sharing the same room.   Around noon I think.  A lazy smile played on Lenny's lips.  Nathan is gonna pick them up when he goes to get his brothers.   It's still weird that Nathan was part of a fraternity.  Duke shook his head.   No, what's weird is that they still show up at my house every New Year's Eve.   But it's really Nathan's party.  We both know you wouldn't throw a party. . . ever.  Duke smiled as he sipped his hot chocolate.   Very true.  Lenny agreed.   Duke let the silence become comfortable again.  They had talked a lot the past few days.  Lenny had shared nearly every detail of being with the band.  Duke was positive he'd be able to identify them by name on sight.  She had obviously made lasting friendships with these guys.  He understood why she was going to at least finish the tour.  But he hoped she wasn't using that as an excuse to walk away from snowboarding permanently.  That was what he needed to ask her. . . now, where were the right words?  Is this our last night alone for a while? He kept his gaze focused on the flames but he felt her shift a little on the couch.   Just for a little while. . . I'm coming home after Europe.   Duke didn't reveal his surprise at her answer.  He took another slow slip of hot chocolate before asking his next question.   What about Luke? He didn't want to know, but he had to just the same.   I don't know, Duke.  She let out a deep breath.  I like him and stuff but he's a rock star.  And, I guess, I just don't see a future there.  She stretched her legs toward him and reclined against the armrest.  I miss being here, with you.  This is nice, right?  Nice? This is my personal heaven.  Yeah, it's nice.  Duke knew she was staring at him so he finally turned to meet her eyes.  She gave him a small smile and he deepened his frown.  You ever gonna go back out there? Her smile faded and she looked away.   I don't know.  Her voice just above a whisper, I'm scared.   Duke narrowed his eyes, Of what, Lenny? He matched her tone, not wanting to make her jumpy.  Her eyes lost focus as she stared into the fire and Duke knew the answer lay there, in her perfect memory.  But she wasn't telling him tonight.             Lenny watched as Nathan hung the giant silver and gold wreath in the main foyer.  He really loved decorating way too much for a mixed martial arts professional.   Does that look centered to you? He asked, leaning back on the ladder trying to get a better vantage point.   Yes, it's perfect, stop obsessing.  Lenny chuckled and crossed her arms over her chest.  The whole place looks perfect, you've outdone yourself this year.   Nathan grinned at her and she swore he was seventeen again instead of his actual age of thirty-five.  His blue eyes shone brightly as he hopped off the ladder and surveyed his latest achievement.   I am pretty awesome, aren't I? He stood proudly with his fists on his hips, a happy smile spread on his face.  This party is my favorite every year and this one is probably my best yet.   Why did you decide to pull out all the stops this year? Lenny picked up a box of extra decorations, handing it to Nathan and then picking up another one for herself.  He followed her through the house and towards the garage.   I don't know, last big hurrah I guess.   Lenny spun suddenly, nearly colliding with Nathan as she stopped short.  What? This is the last one?  Nathan chuckled, I guess you haven't heard then?  Lenny shook her head, waiting for his explanation.   I completed my coaches certification a few months ago and to make a very long story short, the USOC has tapped me to be assistant coach for Team USA.  I'm going to be busy for a while.  Like, years.   Oh my gosh, Nathan! Lenny set her box down hastily and threw her arms around her big brother's neck.  I'm so proud of you! Congratulations!  Nathan shifted the his own box to one arm and hugged her back, his smile stretching from ear to ear.  Thanks, Len.  I'm pretty excited about it.  I've always loved coaching and the Olympics is the ultimate for me.   Lenny picked up her box again and they resumed their trek through the house to deposit them in the garage.  She asked him questions as they popped into her head, truly looking forward to her brother's new future.  As they entered the garage and Lenny turned the lights on she froze in her place by the door.  She had gotten distracted by her excitement for Nathan that she had momentarily forgotten her earlier trepidation at entering this specific part of the Lodge.   Nathan stood next to her and let out a low whistle, That is a lot of equipment.   All along the back wall of the the oversized garage was a huge assortment of snowboards.  It looked like a display from at an athletic gear store.  Every size, shape and color imaginable adorned the entire length of the wall.  Duke had expertly hung the shelving and track lighting in order to make it look like an art exhibition.  A huge cabinet with a glass front showcased her various helmets, goggles and boots.   Lenny swallowed twice before setting down her box.  It was an odd feeling, like walking into a funeral of someone you used to know well but just didn't anymore.   You okay?  Lenny snapped her eyes to Nathan, his face was filled with concern.  Her throat was dry and she swallowed again before she answered.   I'm fine.  Her voice was clipped and and she knew he didn't believe her but she didn't want to have this conversation.   Lenny, Nathan had already set his box down and he took a hesitant step towards her, let's talk about it.   Lenny stiffened.  There's nothing to talk about.  I'm fine.  We have a party to get ready for.  She spun on her heel and left the garage with Nathan hot on her trail.   There's no way you're okay, you're very clearly not okay.  He wasn't exactly shouting but his voice was louder than Lenny thought necessary.  She ignored him and rounded the corner leading down a long hallway that would take her to the dining room.  She had a lot to get done before the caterer arrived.   Lenny, please! Nathan grabbed her elbow from behind and she yanked it away.  I'm your brother, please talk to me about it.   Hot tears started to burn the back of Lenny's eyes and she grit her teeth in frustration.  She came into the dining room and ran full-on into Duke.  He grabbed her by her forearms to keep her from falling but he didn't miss the agitated look on her face.  She turned away and tried to move past him.   What's going on? Duke asked, not letting go and directing his question more at Nathan than Lenny.   She won't talk to me.  Nathan's frustration was obvious.   About what? Duke's deep frown looked down into Lenny's eyes and she silently begged him to not pursue this.   The same thing she always hides from. . . snowboarding.  Nathan ran his hand through his short hair and let out an exasperated growl.  Just forget it.  I have to get to the airport.  He paused and took a deep breath.  I'm sorry, I hope this doesn't ruin your night.  He exchanged a look with Duke and left them alone.   Duke's frown stayed put and Lenny felt her heart rate returning to normal.   You okay? He asked, letting go of her arms finally.   Yeah.  Lenny gave a him a small smile and cleared her throat.  Um, can you put the ladder in the foyer away? I'm going to go take a shower.   Duke nodded but he didn't say anything.  Lenny headed to her room, relieved that Duke had been there.  Always backing her play.             The music had started pulsing long before the party started.  Nathan hired a DJ every year and they had moved the furniture in the ginormous living room to make way for a dance floor.   Lenny wondered if Nathan was back yet.  If Luke was there.   She had spent considerable extra time getting ready.  She hadn't seen Luke in a while and she wanted to look. . . pretty.  She curled her hair in loose waves that hung down her back and lined her eyes with charcoal, giving a slight smoky effect.  She considered wearing a party dress but settled on skinny jeans and a dark purple top that showed off her shoulders.   Nathan's New Year's Eve parties were unique in that they were amazing and alcohol free.  He wasn't taking any kind of an ethical stand.  They were a family of athletes, and winter was the height of training, it just never combined well.  When Duke moved in, an alcohol free environment became the rule since he was a recovering alcoholic.  It was one of the reason's Lenny had been so impressed with the band's support of Mike's sobriety.  It was an obvious indication of loyalty and devotion.   But the lack of alcohol never made the party dull by any means.  Nathan's frat brothers usually had a pool tournament, snowmobile races in the back and of course dancing.   Lenny took a deep breath and looked at herself in the mirror one last time.             Cody rubbed her temples with her fingertips while Clara prattled on and on about something she had absolutely no interest in whatsoever.  Where did she find these people? Oh yeah, they were her friends.  The limo bumped along the snowy road and Cody knew they were getting closer to their destination.   She took a slim bottle out of her purse and drained the remaining contents.  She knew Lenny's little soiree would be dry and she was going to need to be decently lubricated if she planned on being a good guest.   What is that? Erin asked, her wide brown eyes watching Cody swallow the remaining liquid in a flourish.   Fun in a bottle.  Cody winked, Want some? She produced a second bottle and uncapped it, handing it to Erin.   Erin took a swallow and sputtered; she passed it to Clara sitting next to her who also took a swallow.   I thought there was no drinking at this party.  Clara downed more than she needed and Cody was delighted.  This might be more fun than she had originally anticipated.   That's why we have to do it now.  She answered and took the bottle back, pouring more down her throat and then shoving the bottle back into Erin's hands.  She raised her eyebrows in silent expectation and Erin caved.  She tipped the bottle back and took several gulps.  Cody pursed her lips, this was most definitely going to be fun.             Lenny hugged Cody in greeting, shocked that she had shown up at all.  They hadn't spoken since Denver and she hadn't intended to invite her.  Cody had brought her usual entourage of girls in skimpy party dresses but it was the overwhelming smell of vodka that rolled off of the group that made Lenny recoil.   Have you been drinking? Lenny asked in Cody's ear.  The response was loud laughter followed by Cody heading for the dance floor.   Lenny shook her head disgustedly, going back to the kitchen to check on the caterers.  That girl was walking a line that Lenny never understood.  She wanted to throw her out but she also didn't want to end the party just as it was starting.   She found Duke who had actually dressed up a little, for Duke anyway.  He was wearing his nicest flannel and hed trimmed his beard.  He looked at Lenny with a twinkle in his gray eyes and stole another little sandwich off of a tray that a young lady was feverishly trying to fill.   Im glad you decided to come off the mountain and join us.  Lenny smiled and got a bottle of water out of the fridge.   Well, someone has to keep an eye on the food.  He winked at the little attendant again as she moved the tray out of his reach.   You should come mingle, Cody is here.  She brought her usual entourage.   How bout Nate the Great?  Yeah, his old frat brothers are here, makes for a weird mix.  Lenny laughed at the absurdity.  Codys friends were all in their early twentys whereas Nathans friends were a good ten years older and had careers.   Just then, someone came up behind Lenny and touched her elbow.  She turned to see Lukes smiling face.  A thousand different frequencies of joy washed over her.  She impulsively put her arms around him, hugging him close.   Hey, you.  She greeted warmly.             Luke held her a little tighter and a little longer than would normally be socially acceptable.  He breathed in her familiar scent and made a rumbling noise in the back of his throat that could only be described as pure contentment.  He had missed her.   The man Lenny had been talking to cleared his throat from behind her and Luke released his embrace.  He looked into steel grey eyes and stuck out his hand.   Hi, Im Luke Casey.   Duke.  The man replied with a firm handshake.   The way Lenny and Cody had spoken of him, he had expected an old man.  Instead, he found himself face to face with someone maybe only five years or so older than himself.  His athletic build was evident despite his thick flannel shirt and Luke found himself standing a little straighter.  This was the guy Lenny had been living with for the past week?  Duke, this is the lead singer for Double Blind Study.  Lenny introduced and Luke struggled with his sudden desire to put his arm around her possessively.   Right, the circus you left town with.  Duke nodded.   Luke squinted slightly, trying to decipher the undertones in which Duke spoke.   Mike, Sway, Harrison and Blake descended upon Lenny at that moment, crowding the kitchen and making it even harder for the caterers to maneuver.   Blake picked Lenny up and gave her a bear hug.  She squealed in surprise and slapped his shoulder so he would put her down.  She hugged the rest of the guys, happy to see them, then introduced them to Duke as well.  Handshakes happened all around, manly grunting and stiff greetings.  Lenny must have noticed the subtle tenseness that lingered and tried to break it up.   Lets get out of the kitchen so these people can do their jobs.  She led them out to the open living room where the dancing was in full combustion.  Luke saw Cody at the center of the mess and he wasn't surprised.   Some girls spotted the rockers and pulled most of them onto the dance floor.  Luke hung back, wanting a few minutes alone with Lenny if it was available.  It had been far too long since he had kissed her perfect lips.  He slipped his arm around her waist resting his hand high on her hip, having brief eye contact with Duke but acting as casual as possible.   Maybe Duke picked up on Luke's not so subtle hint, maybe he was just hungry but he suddenly announced he needed more sandwiches and left Luke and Lenny alone together.   Lenny watched the band members dancing with Cody's friends and she scrunched up her nose.  Maybe this was a bad idea.   Youre not on duty, theyre gonna be fine.  Luke lightly laughed at her reaction.   A thin girl with short, caramel colored hair was laughing too loudly and Luke suspected she had been drinking before her arrival.  She staggered off the dance floor and came towards Lenny.   Do you know where some water is? I'm so thirsty.  Then she burst into giggles again.   Lenny pulled the girl towards the kitchen stopping just in the doorway.  She ducked inside and came back quickly, handing the girl a bottle of water.  As the girl thirstily sucked the water down, Luke saw Lenny's face become unreadable.             How do you know Cody? Lenny asked the girl tightly.   I'm Erin, I met her through my boyfriend, well, I guess hes not really my boyfriend, I dont know what we are.  Erin giggled again and a hiccup escaped.   Where is he tonight? Lenny tried to sound casual but she was getting the weirdest sensation in the pit of her stomach.   He said he shouldnt come because it would be too hard to see his ex and he thought she might be here.  Erin rambled nervously and looked around the room like she was expecting the girl to pop out and scare her.  It took him a long time to get over her, I guess she really broke his heart.   Thats too bad.  Luke said tenderly and Lenny shot a frown his way but he missed it.  New Years Eve is always such a special night, Im sorry he couldnt be here with you.   Erin nodded emphatically, I dont know who the ex is but I guess she totally obliterated him.  Weve had to work through a lot of issues involving trust and honesty and stuff.  Erin noticed Lennys eyes narrow and she stammered.  Im sorry, I'm talking too much.  She giggled nervously.   No, its fine.  Lenny forced a smile and put her hand on Erins arm.  Just keep in mind, theres always two sides to every story.   Sounds like the ex is a real bitch.  Luke interjected and Lenny felt her mouth fall open as she looked at him.   Cody shimmied her way over to them and threw an overly friendly arm around Luke's waist.  Hey, whatcha talkin' bout? Her face was flushed from the excessive alcohol in her system as well as the dancing.   Erin was just telling us about the guy shes seeing Luke began not moving from away from Cody's side.   Yeah, Shane.  Cody nodded, Bet you guys could compare notes.  She laughed as she winked at Lenny who only returned a slow subtle shake of her head.  But it was too late.  Even though Erin's faculties had been reduced due to her drinking, she wasn't completely brain dead.  She turned towards Lenny, eyes wild.   Wait, youre the ex? Erins giggling was replaced by a a more heated expression.   Shane who? Luke frowned, not following along.   Shane Brookings, my boyfriend! Erin pointed at herself and took a step away from Lenny like she was afraid of her suddenly.   You told me that wasnt serious.  Luke's voice was dark and he looked at the floor.   It. . . wasnt.  Lenny looked from Luke to Cody to Erin.  How was this happening? Her eyes settled on Cody who had the slightest of smirks on her face, arm firmly in place around Luke's waist.   Yeah, for you! Erin exclaimed.  Im the one who had to try and to pick up the pieces after you left him six months ago!  Six months? You made it sound like you had been broken up for a lot longer than that.  Lukes frown was deepening and he started to back away from them, pushing Cody's arm off of him.   Ill talk to you in a minute.  Lenny said to Luke and then she turned to Erin.  She needed to get this back under control.  Too many things were unraveling at the same time and she wasn't prepared.  Please, try to understand that there is a lot more to the story than what you know.  I never meant to hurt Shane.   I suppose you had this guy just waiting around for you.  Erin pointed at Luke.  You were probably seeing both of them at the same time.   Lenny looked at Cody who was watching everything unfold with a look of sadistic glee smeared across her face.   I need some air.  Luke said brusquely and stalked off.   Lenny wanted to follow him but she needed to end this nightmare first.  She turned back to Erin who was almost in tears.   Erin, Im sorry for whatever hurt Ive caused you by breaking up with Shane.  I never cheated on him and if he has trust issues thats not my fault.  Lenny's words were forced and clipped but she was too angry about what was happening to care.   Whatever, Im going home.  Erin grabbed one of the girls off the dance floor and began to cry until the girl agreed to find her a ride home.   Lenny glared at Cody.  Wow, was that planned or what?  I forgot she was seeing Shane- Cody started to lie but Lenny cut her off.   Bullshit, Cody! Thats how you met, she already told me.  Lenny rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest.  I put up with a lot of your shit because of Duke but I've about reached my limit.   Don't get mad at me because Shane moved on.  Cody's face grew venomous.   This isn't about Shane! Lenny was starting to shake.  This is about you being a horrible friend!  Excuse me? Cody raised her eyebrows aggressively.  You were the one who skipped town the day of one of the biggest meetings of my life! I needed your backing to land that sponsorship and you didn't even call!  I'm sorry, I didn't know it was up to me to secure your future for you! Lenny replied sarcastically.  Maybe you should have been a decent human being instead of alienating everyone around you.   You're such a spoiled little bitch! You have always had every little thing handed to you and what wasn't given to you, you had no problem taking! Cody's lips twisted savagely and Lenny stepped into a defensive stance.  Cody had been drinking and Lenny knew that if she attacked it would be sudden and sloppy.   Ladies, how about we take a breather.  Nathan inserted himself into the confrontation.  He nodded at one of his frat bros who came over and took Cody's elbow, leading her away.  Lenny didn't break eye contact with her until they had rounded the corner.   What was that all about? Nathan asked when they were finally alone.   Cody brought Shane's new girlfriend to the party.  Did you know that he's telling people I cheated on him? Lenny felt her eyebrows go up when Nathan nodded.  You don't believe it, do you? How did I end up the villain in this?  No, I don't believe that you cheated on him.  But he was really hurt by your leaving and I think he's just handling it badly.   This is unbelievable.  Lenny's face was hot and she wished she could go outside for a break from this. . . insanity.   Nathan took a breath and continued.  You have to remember the facts.  You and Shane dated for over two years.  He got your name tattooed on his arm, he moved to Wyoming to be closer to you, and I have it on pretty good authority that he was getting ready to propose to you before you dumped himin a text message.   Geez, Nate.  You make me sound like a monster.  Lenny was really growing tired of how people assumed they knew what had happened between her and Shane.   Im not trying to.  I just think you need to realize someday that your actions have consequences.  Just because you werent invested in the relationship didnt mean he wasnt.  You kind of treated him like crap and he was a really great guy.   A really great guy? What-the-frick-ever.  What are you saying? Lenny was trying hard to bite her tongue.  Nathan had no idea what he was talking about.   Nathan let out a heavy sigh.  If you weren't in love with him I don't understand why you waited two years to end it.  And I have to wonder about the new guy.  Lenny shot him a glare and Nathan swallowed hard.  If youre not in love, dont lead him on.  End it soon and be gentle.             Luke found himself on the back patio, without a coat in the cold mountain air.  Someone approached him from behind and handed him a heavy jacket.  Luke slipped it on and turned to thank the individual.  It was Duke.  Perfect.   Duke nodded at him and gestured to a set of chairs off to the side of the patio.  Luke followed him and sat down, not sure what to expect from this conversation.  A lot had happened so far tonight and he hadn't processed any of it.  So far, all he had gathered was, Lenny had a much more serious relationship with Shane than she had led him to believe.  Oh, and she was living with a very attractive man who stank of testosterone in the backwoods of Wyoming.   Saw that little display in there, Duke started.   Luke grunted and looked up at the stars.   If you wanna be with Lenny youre in for one hell of a ride.  Duke chuckled to himself.  She probably spent too much time on the mountain, never learned all the girl stuff.  Her mom was always after her to hang out with people her age doing regular teenage things like, go to the mall.  Duke shook his head, But Lenny wouldnt have it.  Nope.  Our Bird had to be free.  Duke nodded to the starlit mountain line.  Out there, the only place Ive seen her truly happy.  His words hung in the silent cold for a while.   So youre saying that its probably not gonna last.  Luke responded quietly, feeling his gut twist.   I didnt say that.  Duke countered.  I said it would be one hell of a ride.  Duke gave a sly smile.  Dont give up.  Youre already loads better than that tool, Shane.   I thought Shane was perfect.  Luke grumbled despondently.   Ha! Yeah, he sure was pretty.  Duke let out a dark chuckle.  He wasnt all that.  He was nice but he wasnt any good for her.   What makes me different? Luke couldn't help but ask.  Here he was, with someone who probably knew Lenny better than she knew herself.  What made Luke the guy?  After her accident, a little piece of her died.  I know that sounds macabre but its true.  She left a chunk of herself out there.  Shane tried to bring her back to life, I tried, her folks tried but it was no use.  It was like talking to a walking corpse.  Duke breathed out through is nose.  But shes suddenly back.  I look in her eyes and I see her in there.  Dukes voice grew thick with emotion.  Youre the one who found her.   Luke looked back up at the stars.  He wanted badly for what Duke said to be true.  He had never felt for anyone the way he felt for Lenny.  But was that enough? She obviously had issues with commitment and an addiction to fight or flight.   Its worth it.  Duke said into the darkness as if reading his thoughts.  Grab that light and dont let go.        12    Magpies On Fire      After several minutes outside with Duke, Sway came and got Luke, asking him to be his partner in the pool tournament.  Luke had reluctantly agreed, wanting more to sulk in the cold.   As the game got underway, Luke regretted even more that he'd agreed to this.  For some reason, Cody was the only girl in the room and she was being very. . . vigilant.  She kept finding reasons to stand very close to him.  She hardly spoke to him, but he could feel eyes on him wherever he took a shot.   He and Sway won the first round and moved on to the next.  All Luke could think about was how he hadn't seen Lenny in over a week and he was playing pool with a bunch of dudes he didn't know with a drunk chick attached to his hip.  It was not his ideal situation.   Some of the guys cleared out to race snowmobiles and Luke and Sway went onto the next round.   You're really good at this game.  Cody leaned over and Luke caught a whiff of vodka off her words.  She must have some stashed nearby, Luke hadn't seen any being served.   Thanks.  He responded tersely as he lined up his shot.   Cody pressed her body against his side and he felt her hot breath in his ear.  After this game you want to go. . . somewhere?  Luke's stomach roiled inside and he clenched his teeth.  He made his shot despite Cody's interference and he walked away from her to the other side of the room.  Sway gave him a perplexed look and Luke ignored him.   Cody was close behind, not deterred in the slightest.  Luke wasn't sure how to deal with this.  He was used to women pawing at him, but it had never been the best friend of the girl he was with.  Wasn't this against girl code? Did girls have a code?  Just then, Blake walked into the room.  Shirtless.  Luke could have kissed him.   Hey, Luke handed him his cue, Play for me, I have to go do a thing.  He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder.   Blake didn't hesitate, he grabbed the cue in one hand and Cody around the waist with the other.  Be my lucky charm? He grinned down at her and she giggled.   Luke was thankful for his brash and bold band mate as he booked it out of there.  He needed to find Lenny.  He knew a couple of hours had passed and he had to talk to her.  This wasn't right.             The snowmobile races wrapped up and Duke put the sleds away.  Lenny watched from the patio, her hands shoved deep in her coat pockets.  What a crappy New Year's.  For her anyway.  Everyone else seemed to be having a wonderful time.  Did it bother her that she hadn't seen Luke in a while? Yes.  Did it bother her that she also had not seen Cody during that time? More than she liked to admit.             Luke didn't want to appear frantic.  So he casually strolled through the huge Lodge that was packed with people.  He smiled and chatted with those who recognized him but he was searching for Lenny.   He glanced in what he assumed was some sort of den.  It was fairly dark, lit only by a few candles artistically placed around the room.  No one else was in the room and he took a few steps inside to see if there might be another room beyond a door or something.  This house was massive and damn if he hadn't already gotten turned around a few times in it.   There you are.   Luke turned to see Cody closing the door and smiling at him seductively.   Hey, Cody.  Have you seen Lenny? Luke tried to remain polite but she was testing his patience.   Cody curled a lip up, Why do you care where Lenny is? She's not here, that's all that matters.  She began to step towards him and Luke shook his head in wonder.  How were they even friends?  You can do to me all the things you want to do to her.  She's never gonna love you.  She only cares about herself.  Cody slid her hands up Luke's shoulders and pressed her body against him.  Luke grabbed her hands and took a large step backwards.   You're drunk, Cody.  He tried to give her an excuse but he knew in his gut that this is who she really was.  And it sickened him.   Cody, your ride is here.  A gruff voice interrupted them and Luke looked up, startled to see Duke standing in the doorway.  Cody didn't even seem to notice.  She leaned towards Luke again.   Duke entered the room and grabbed Cody by the arm.  Your ride is here.  He repeated, his eyes flashing to Luke's.  Cody struggled against him as he forced her out the door.   What's your problem, Duke? She shrieked, wrestling out of his grasp.   Duke scooped her up and flung her over his shoulder.  He nodded at Luke, Can you help me with the door?  Luke had no words; he just did as the man asked.  The way to the front door was cleared of human presence and Luke wondered how that was even possible.  But it would probably benefit Cody some if no one saw the degrading way she was being asked to leave.   The limo driver waiting outside didn't even look surprised as Duke shoved his niece into the car.  The rest of her friends were already inside and Luke heard a plethora of questions being hurled in Cody's direction.  Duke slammed the car door and the driver made haste getting underway.   Duke placed his hands on his hips and gave Luke a hard stare.  You want to tell me what that was? His words coming out as white puffs in the cold air.   I was looking for Lenny.  Luke knew what it must have looked like when Duke had opened the door but he had to know the reality.  Didn't he?  Duke met him with silence.  His frown deeper than Luke had seen it all night and he realized that with one word, Duke could turn Lenny against him.  If Duke didn't want him around this was the perfect opportunity to make that happen.             Lenny cruised through the Lodge reminding all the remaining guests that the countdown to midnight was happening in fifteen minutes.  She had no explanation for why Blake and Sway were both playing pool in only their boxers and she didn't ask.  She found Harrison and Mike had taken over the DJ's job and were playing a mix all their own.  It seemed that Cody and the rest of her friends had vacated early and Lenny felt a mixture of relief and apprehension.  She still hadn't seen Luke and her worst fear was that he had left with Cody.  He wouldn't do that? Would he?  Nathan, Lenny almost ran into her brother as he came in from the backyard.  Have you seen Luke?  Nathan nodded over his shoulder, He's out back with Duke.  They're having some sort of heavy conversation.   Lenny frowned.  What? She had just been back there and hadn't seen either one of them.  She grabbed her coat and hat and went back out into the cold.             The sound from the party got louder and then quieted again as someone came outside from the patio door.  Soft footsteps on the granite came toward them and Luke looked up to see Lenny approaching slowly.  She had put on a dark coat and a black stocking cap, making her blonde hair and creamy skin stand out.  She shoved her hands in her coat pockets and stood in front of him.   I think we need to talk.  Her eyes flicked over to Duke momentarily and Luke had to wonder again at the extent of their friendship.  He knew what Duke had told him but how could he be sure there wasn't more there?  I think so, too.  Luke agreed.  He definitely had some questions.   Duke, could you give us a minute? Lenny asked.   Duke sighed as he slowly stood up.  He grumbled something unintelligible to himself.  He patted Luke on the shoulder.  Remember what I told you.   Luke nodded but didnt reply.   Lenny sat down in Dukes vacated chair and frowned at his figure as he let himself into the house.  What did Duke tell you?  Guy stuff, Luke hedged.  What do you want to talk about?  Lenny closed her eyes like she was trying to get her thoughts in line before she spoke.  Im sorry about what. . . Erin said in there.  I had no ideaany of that was going to happen.   Was it true? Luke kept his voice flat.   What do you mean? Lenny was playing too innocent, she was hiding again.   Were you and Shane more serious than you led me to believe? Luke asked evenly, not wanting it to come out like he was threatened.   I dont see how that matters, she answered darkly.   Really? Cmon, Lenny.  Lukes eyes bored into hers.  Was he in love with you?  She swallowed several times before answering, I dont know.  I mean, how can you really know what someone else feels? He said he did but that doesnt mean anything.  But II didnt love him back.  And I never told him I loved him.   How long were you guys together? Luke was afraid of the answer but he had to know.  He had to know where that put them.  If there even was a them to be worried about.   A little over two years- Lenny broke off as Luke cursed under his breath.   And you broke up with him how long before you met me? He knew he sounded accusatory but he was too agitated to stop.   The corner of Lenny's mouth twitched and she looked cornered, trapped.  Luke hated himself for making her feel that way.  But she didn't run away, instead, she set her jaw and spoke plainly.  I sent him a text, telling him it wasnt working.  From the airport.  Right before I boarded the plane and met you.  Her voice was devoid of emotion.   A text? Lenny? A text? To a man who is in love with you? Luke was losing it.  Lenny's lack of emotion seemed to amplify his.  He knew he was overreacting, but his train of rational thought had derailed a few minutes ago and he wasn't getting it back anytime soon.   I dont understand why this so upsetting for you.  Lenny spoke coldly.  Im not with him, I dont have feelings for him, why does this make you crazy?  Luke shot up from his chair and put both hands on top of his hair as he stepped a few paces across the patio and stood with his back to Lenny.  She was the first girl that he had ever revealed so much of himself to.  The first one who looked at him and he really felt like she saw him.  Not the public image of him, the one girls wanted to sleep with so they could feel famous.  But who he was at his center.  At his most real.   He took a couple of breaths and then turned back to her, his heart racing with both hope and fear.  Mind numbing, logic splintering fear.   Because, Lenny.  Because I'm in love with you and it's turning me into a freaking basket case.  He took a step forward.  Because Im crazy about you.  Because I love just being near you.  Because I want to be with you all the time.  Because you mean so frickin' much to me.  And, from what everyone else has said, I cant help but think that Shane felt the same way and you He shook his head and raked his hands through his hair in exasperation.   I what? Lenny narrowed her eyes at him.   Luke dropped his hands against his thighs, You. . . you dont care.  You already said you didnt have feelings for him.  For two years.  He sighed heavily.  Am I just supposed to wait around until you finally figure out that you dont have feelings for me either? Will it just come in the form of a text?  Lennys frown was deep as she responded.  What we have is different than what I had with Shane.  You cant compare the two.   Luke sat down again and grabbed her by her hands, looking her in the eye.  Then tell me what we have.  What is this?  He stared into her dark blue eyes, eyes that were the same color as the night sky.  Eyes that just a few weeks ago had looked at him in peace and adoration but seemed deep and empty tonight.   The noise from the party grew as the countdown began to midnight.  Luke kept hold of her, waiting for a response.   I dont know.  She said stiffly, giving him the exact answer that he had been afraid of.   Luke held her hands a moment longer and then slumped into his chair, defeated.             The revelers started to go home after an hour or so and the house became quieter.  The caterers and DJ had cleaned up and cleared out.  Lenny walked through the dark, empty Lodge, picking up trash and leftover drinks.  She blew out the candles and turned lights off in vacant rooms.   After she had told Luke she didn't know how to define their relationship, he had gotten up and gone for a walk.  Lenny had stayed on the back patio long enough for everyone to leave or go to bed so she wouldnt have to talk to anyone.  She could barely feel her fingers and toes when she had slid the back door open.   She stuffed the last of the trash into the bag in her hand.  This was not how she was hoping tonight would have gone.  She was glad the rest of her guests had had a good time but things with her and Luke wereawkward at best.  He wanted some kind of absolution from her and she didnt know what to think, let alone what to feel.  She knew she hadaffection for him.  But there was no way that could sustain a relationship.  Especially when one of them was as busy and famous as Luke.   She took the full trash bag out to the garage and put it in the can, pausing to look at the back wall.  She sighed heavily as she slowly walked towards what had been her vehicle to freedom since she was a child.  She missed it.  Desperately.  Like the way a person misses air from the bottom of a pool.  She hadn't felt free. . . in a long time.   She turned when someone in the doorway cleared their throat.  Duke stood watching her in navy blue pajama pants and a long sleeve white tee shirt.  She thought he had gone to bed with everyone else.   Deep thoughts? He asked.   She half-smirked, Are there any other kinds?  He stepped down into the garage and stood next to Lenny with his hands in his pockets.   What happened with you and Eddie Vedder?  Lenny smiled at Dukes nickname for Luke.  At least it was better than Tool Shed which is what he had called Shane the entire time they were together.   Nothing.  We argued, sort of.  I don't know.  Lenny said, regret touching her voice.   Did he tell you that Cody made a play for him?  Lenny felt like she'd gotten kicked in the gut.  She wasn't surprised but to have it confirmed made it harder to deny Cody's true nature.  No, her mouth was instantly dry.  He didn't mention it.  And why should he?  That didn't shock you.  It was a statement.   Lenny didn't reply, she was running out of words to try and explain things away.   What did you argue about then? Duke pressed.   He wants something I can't give him.  Lenny rolled her eyes at the absurdity.  Imagine, a man stressing over the girl not ready for a commitment.  He wants to know how I feel.  She scoffed, thinking Duke would laugh with her.   How do you feel? He asked her seriously, looking at the garage floor.   I don't know, Duke.  Lenny frowned at him.  Why do you care? Her stomach tightened as the mood in the room shifted with her words.   Cmon, Lenny.  Dont you think youre kind of being a brat about this? Dukes tone had an edge he had never directed at Lenny and she was taken off guard.   What do you mean? She felt bitterness crawl into her mouth and she grit her teeth together.  Duke's sudden coldness was neither helpful nor warranted.   Im not gonna lecture you or give a big speech.  Just He took a few seconds to collect his thoughts and when he started speaking again she felt his agitation towards her in a way that she never had before.  He was disappointed in her.  Life is hard, Lenny.  And people tend to suck, I mean, no ones perfect.  We need someone in our lives to help us through it.  We make each other better, stronger.   Yeah, but who's to say that I need Luke? Lenny clipped, feeling herself getting defensive.   Fed up, Duke waved his hand at the back wall of snowboards and raised his voice, Thats your passion, right there, hanging on the wall like a dead animal! You really just gonna walk away from your first true love? He turned and waved at the Lodge, That man in there, brought you back to life when the rest of us were afraid you were beyond hope.  And you dont know how you feel? The reasons you wont get back on the board or admit your feelings for Luke are the same.  Youre afraid of losing the control.  You think you cant get hurt if you can control it.  Well, guess what? Love isnt like that.  Youre either all in or not.  He let out a disgusted breath and paced a short distance across the garage floor.   Lennys face was hot.  She was angry.  Duke didn't have the right to tell her her reasons.  They were hers and hers alone, she didn't owe him an explanation.  And she didn't owe Luke one either.   I thought you said you werent going to lecture me, she bit out.   I lied! Duke snapped indignantly.  Your family and I have been far too forgiving and coddling to you.  You need to grow up one of these days.   This coming from a guy who hates organized sports and lives alone in a house I paid for! Lenny was taking it too far but she wanted to hurt him the way he was hurting her.   Hey! Duke stormed towards her, pointing his finger in her face.  I dont need your charity, say the word and Im gone!  Lenny stood her ground, she was afraid in that moment that maybe Duke actually would leave but she was too stubborn to take back her words.  Instead she jutted out her chin and clenched her jaw.   You cant keep running away from the things that scare you! Duke threw his hands out to the sides in exasperation.   I didn't run away! Lenny shouted back, angry tears burning the back of her eyes.   Really? His sarcasm thick, Then what would you call it?  Escaping! Lenny's stomach fell to the floor as she shouted her truth across the garage.  His eyes grew wide at her response and she felt her hands starting to tremble.  The room was quiet and Lenny could hear her pulse roaring through her ears.  She looked down at the floor, unable to watch Duke's face as he tried to read her mind.  Tried to figure out where she had gone.  She was tired of carrying her secret for so long.  She knew it had changed her.  She had let it change her, propelled that change.  She didnt want to be who she had been.  She wanted to be someone else.  She wanted to be safe.   Were you a prisoner? He asked, his voice calm, concerned.             I'm not. . . I'm not doing this.  Lenny's voice sounded tired and scared.  Duke knew he was almost there.  He didn't want to push her.  He had wanted her to come to terms with it on her own.  She was more stubborn than he had given her credit for.  He knew that there was a huge likelihood that she would hate him after this.  He had to take that risk.  She needed him to.   What happened, Lenny? It was the question everyone kept asking her, the one she had never answered.   I told you, I don't remember.  She crossed her arms over her middle and stared at the floor.  Duke thought she looked especially small like that.   You've never forgotten a detail in your life.  Tell me the truth.  His voice was hard, unforgiving.  A flash of terror went across her face.  How he hated himself.   What happened to the girl who looked fear in the face and laughed as she found her line? Her eyes unfocused and he knew he was reaching her.   What happened to the girl who flew past seasoned backwoods riders and raged down the ridge line in Alaska? She shifted and turned away from him.  Duke was close, he could feel it.  He was going to have to wreck her before he could save her.  He raised his voice again, forcing the issue.  What happened, Lenny? Whered she go?  I cant do this.  Lenny started to the door of the garage but Duke got there first.   No, we do this now.  No more running.  He blocked the way with his body and Lenny tried to push past him but he was solid.  He grabbed her by her shoulders and looked into her face as she stared at the center of his chest.   Let me by, Duke.  Lenny said, a false fire on her tongue.   No.  Duke repeated.  He clenched his jaw, having a final debate with his insides on whether or not he should be doing this.  I want to know what happened to you.  He swallowed his own fear and took a deep breath.  I wanna know where the girl is that I fell in love with.   Lenny met his eyes at last and he saw pain and betrayal covered by confusion.   What? The word was a whisper and he almost didn't hear it due to the ringing in his ears at his own confession.   Yeah, Lenny.  His voice low.  Where is the strong, powerful, confident woman that I am hopelessly in love with? He'd said it twice now.  He hoped he didn't throw up before they got through this.   Lenny looked down at the floor; she reeled like she'd just gotten the wind knocked out of her.  She turned to walk away but Duke grabbed her arm and whirled her back to face him.  Lenny pushed him away with force, her face twisted in anger.   Stop saying that! She yelled.  Stop using that word! What is wrong with you people?  She backed away from Duke, her eyes wild.  Shane, Luke, now YOU?! You dont know what love is! Stop throwing that word around like it means something! She screamed at him, her hands clenched into fists at her sides.   Duke felt his tears pool in the corners of his eyes as he watched her fall apart in front of him.  He couldn't stop now, he was committed, and they were almost there.  He grabbed her by the shoulders again and looked her square in the face.   Tell me what happened, Lenny! Tell me what really happened before the accident! 'Cause I know damn good and well this isnt about a bad wreck!  Tears started to spill down Lennys cheeks as they stared at one another.  The look of defeat that hung in her eyes broke his heart.  A sob caught in her chest as she tried to breathe normally and Duke folded her into his arms.  He held her body as it shook with released emotion.   Shane slept with Cody.  She clung to him as the truth escaped her lips.   Duke closed his eyes and held her close.  So that was it.  That was the big secret.   When? He asked gently, pressing his cheek to the top of her head.   At the Olympics, the day before my event. . . the day before the crash.  Her breathing steadied as she brought her emotions under control again.  I caught them.  They said that it was my fault for being, she swallowed and her voice was laced with cynicism, Such a tease.  They said I was incapable of love and Shane needed a release before his event.  And I was too selfish to help him with it.  A disgusted shiver swept through her body and Duke resisted the urge to put his fist through a wall.   I couldn't get my head right, I lost focus.  Lenny continued shakily.  That's how I wrecked.   She pulled away from him and tried to wipe the watery mess off her face.  She was red and splotchy but her eyes were clear.  Finally.   Duke didn't want to let her go.  He wanted to hold her until she felt safe again.  But that wasn't his place.  Instead, he sat down on the garage step and she settled next to him.   The rest of the story spilled out unencumbered and he had to bite his tongue to keep from going off on his own tangent against Shane and Cody.   After the accident, they both came to see me in the hospital.  The doctor said I had enough brain damage that I probably would never remember the previous twenty-four hours.  So I went with it.  I just couldn't foresee trying to figure out how to walk again while dealing with their shit, you know? I thought they'd get tired of the whole thing and move on if I ignored them.  Then Shane moved out here and Cody wouldn't shut up about a rematch and I guess I just decided I wanted to try a different life for a while.  One where I didn't have to see those two every day.   Why didn't you just confront them after you'd recovered? Duke couldn't help but ask.   Because then they would have known that I lied about forgetting it.  And I was afraid that would make me just like them.   You could never be like them.  Duke put an arm around her shoulder and pulled her against his side.   I didn't realize how much time had gone by until I found the engagement ring in Shane's truck.  I couldn't live a lie, I had to leave.  She paused and looked up at Duke, her face sorrowful.  Im sorry I didnt tell you sooner.   No, Lenny Duke cut her off.  They were wrong on so many levels.  I understand why you split.  You dont have to apologize.   Lenny was quiet for a long time and then she said, I cant stop thinking that they might be right.  Duke looked at her with a frown.  What if I am incapable of love?  Duke sighed heavily and held her tighter.  Youre just incapable of their twisted version of love.  You have more heart and passion than anyone I have ever met.  I see you with your family and your friends and even complete strangers.  Youre kind and compassionate and you honestly care.  He paused, letting his words sink in.  Youre capable of great love; greater than those two will ever experience in their lifetime.   He wrapped both of his arms around her and blinked back his own tears.  Finally.  After so much avoidance and running away, maybe now she could begin to move forward.  He knew there had been a connection between her accident and her resistance to fall in love.  If he could just get her past her fear, shed fall headlong in love with the man who deserved her the most.  And as much as Duke hated to admit it, it wasnt him.   We need to get you on a line as soon as possible.  You can't let them take that away from you.  And not up at Aspen, here, on your home turf.  His voice was thick with emotion.   What if its been too long? What if I forgot everything youve taught me? She asked honestly.   Then I can re-teach you.  Duke replied.  Ill always have your back, you know that.   She seemed to consider his proposal and he felt a thrill go through him that she didn't outright say no this time.   How about you get some sleep, and well talk about a plan tomorrow over breakfast.  He helped her into a standing position.   She gave him a contrite smile, I think I really screwed things up with Luke tonight.   One thing at a time.  Lets get you on a line first.  We can fix everything with Thor after that.   Thor? Lenny asked quizzically.   Well, you know, he has that chiseled jaw and those piercing blue eyes.  Lenny laughed as Duke directed her up into the house and shut off the lights to the garage.             They took the sleds as far as they could and then started to hike up the mountain, the terrain getting steeper the further they climbed.  Lenny refused to think about what was waiting ahead.  Instead she focused on the climb.  She tried to drink in the wilderness.  Savoring every breath that included the scent of fresh pine.  Her steps were solid, she didnt have trouble finding safe footing the whole way up.  Duke was ahead of her and she could tell he was making sure to clear a little of the path to make it easier for her.  She was, after all, out of practice.   The band had protested, when then found out what the plan was but Lenny calmly explained that this was something she had to do.  She could tell they felt left out by being left at the Lodge, but she had to do this without an audience.  Luke, especially, seemed jilted.  But like Duke said, one thing at a time.             Duke was proud of Lenny for telling him the whole truth last night; he knew it hadnt been easy.  He was determined that she see this through.  Nothing had ever seemed so right like when Lenny took to the slopes.  His insides were still churning from all the new information.  Shane had better stay away or Duke would end him.  And Cody, even though she was Dukes niece, was no longer welcome in his home.  Lenny was really the only one who had ever mattered to Duke.   Shed saved his life at a time when he was falling apart.  Hed gotten into the Hollywood scene of snowboarding and things went from awesome to terrifying very quickly.  You can only drink yourself into a blackout so many times before you decide that enough is enough.  He got off the bottle and moved to the mountains where he met his nieces best friend.   Lenny had been only twelve, but she was bold and daring and full of natural talent.  Duke took the little bird under his wing and taught her all he knew.  She gave him a reason to get up even when the depression threatened to force him to drink again.  She took the information he gave her and turned herself into a legend.  He started to only see her in the winter as school and competing took first place.  But they stayed in good contact by phone.   Then, after she had graduated high school at midterm, she wanted to take a trip into the back country of Alaska and ride some fresh powder.  Duke hustled up some of his old riding buddies and arranged a two week trip for his protg.   But when Bird showed up, she wasnt this gangly little middle schooler anymore.  She was nineteen and had transformed into a woman with unrivaled beauty.  Her time spent on the mountains all over the world had given her an untamed, natural allure that was fiercely captivating.  Duke spent most of the trip threatening his friends every time one of them so much as glanced at her.   His buddies did their best to show off but Lenny would match them, challenge for challenge.  She had finally come into her own and Duke had nothing left to teach her.   Thats where it had happened.  Thats where Duke began to look at her with brand new eyes.  She was wild and unstoppable and fearless.  He admired her for her talent and strength and courage.  And little by little, he allowed himself to fall in love with her, knowing that nothing could ever come of it.  She saw him as an old man, and a friend.  And Duke was content with that, feeling blessed to have her friendship, to be that close to a wildfire and not get burned.   Duke had turned thirty during that trip to Alaska.  He was in the prime of his physical riding career.  But even at the top of his game, he took a little spill.  He wrecked pretty majorly, cracking a couple ribs and getting bruised all to hell.  Lenny had taken careful diligence to patch him back up, chewing him out the whole time for being reckless.  He knew he would never forget the way her hands felt on his skin.  Or how her hair fell past her face and tickled his bare chest as she leaned over to pack ice around his shoulder.  He knew that was the closest that hed ever get.  And he had savored every second.   His little confession the night before hadnt come back up.  He knew she hadnt forgotten it, not with her perfect memory, but he didnt want to talk about it anyway.  He knew she needed someone that could offer her more than he could.  He had accepted that years ago.  He had risked his heart and his heart alone, he could deal with that.             They crested the top of Lennys favorite ridge and she felt her heart beating faster and it wasn't just from the climb.  The mountains opened up before her and she could see for miles.   I never get tired of that.  Duke breathed next to her.  Lenny could only nod.   He turned and waited for her to make the first move.   I dont know if I can do this Duke.  Lenny was thinking about trying to convince him that it wasnt time, she wasnt ready.   This is how its going to work.  Duke was all business.  You're gonna strap in, then youre gonna dig your chute, then your whole life is gonna change.   How do you know? Lenny was half stalling and half really wanting to know.  How do you know this is the answer?  Lenny, you have to try, he said gently.  Ill be right here if anything goes wrong.   Lenny took a deep breath.  She leveled off the space where she would start her line and looked down the mountainside.  Her legs were trembling and her heart was racing.  She looked at Duke, her eyes pleading for another way, but she knew she had to do it.  Now that she was up there, she could feel an old persistence creeping up from her toes and making its way to her head.   She had to go.   She had to fly.   She knew she was moving quickly but it felt like slow motion.  She could feel the texture of the snow as it bent beneath her, carving a perfect path.  She let go of all she had been holding back and images started to flash through her mind.  Her fight with Shane, walking in on him and Cody getting dressed, the following argument.  The initial crash, the slow process of recovery, fights with her parents, avoiding Shane, running away with Double Blind Study, Luke.  Luke and his voice and his lips and his amazingly strong arms.   She veered to the left, following her instincts, taking her line over a ridge and going airborne.  The rush was intoxicating.  It was better than she had remembered.  She landed gracefully, fluidly.  Her body a perfectly oiled machine, moving and adjusting with the terrain before her.  She controlled her speed, enjoying every twist and edge.  Her mind was finally starting to put things in order.   This is where she belonged, out in the open.  Free.   Not the condescending Freebird that Cody and Shane had constantly called her which was more a ridicule than a nickname.  No, more innocent than that.  Duke had given her the nickname Bird the first time he met her.  He compared her to a lark and would always quote lines from his favorite George Meredith poem to her while they hiked up to a new chute.  As she went over another lip and caught even more air than before, his voice echoed through her mind:  He rises and begins to round,  He drops the silver chain of sound  Of many links without a break,  In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake,  All intervolved and spreading wide,  Like water dimples down a tide  Where ripple ripple overcurls  And eddy into eddy whirls;  A press of hurried notes that run  So fleet they scarce are more than one,  Yet changing-ly the trills repeat  And linger ringing while they flee,  In that moment, as she seemed to hover in the air with Duke's voice echoing through her head and the images of what had happened flashed before her, she realized that it wasn't her fault.  What Shane and Cody had done was their choice.  She didn't earn their betrayal.  The blame belonged on them.  And it had been wrong for them to try to put it on her.  But it had been even worse that she had allowed them to blame her.   She allowed them to make her feel like she had no worth, like she was nothing.  And she had started running, slowly at first and then gaining momentum with her decision to make that interview with Carl.  She thought if she got far enough away, she'd stop feeling so trapped in her own weakness.  But only facing the truth of what had happened could truly release her.  She finally felt absolved of the guilt that had accompanied their disloyalty and vilification.   Lenny landed safely again, nearly breathless.  Her mind having been put right and finally at peace.  She guided the board expertly to a stop and pushed her goggles up on her head.   She could see Duke making his descent and she shook her head.  He never followed her line.  It was like an unspoken rule between them.  They each had to find their own way.  He came to the edge of a ridge she knew was too steep of a drop, thats why she had avoided it.  She held her breath, hoping against her own gut that he wouldnt go for it.   Sonofabitch Lenny muttered as Duke dropped off the ridge and out of view.  She waited for a few seconds, her heart starting to thud in her chest.  Suddenly, Duke sprang over a slope and raged down the rest of the mountain.  Lenny breathed a sigh of relief.   Duke came skidding to a stop right in front of her, huge grin plastered on his face.   Did you see that? Thought I was a goner for sure! He yelled excitedly.   You scared me half to death! Lenny yelled back, laughing.   Duke disengaged his boots and scooped her up in a huge hug.  She laughed freely as he swung her around.  She hadn't forgotten how to fly after all.        13    The Deepest Blues Are Black      Lenny and Duke had been gone all day.  It was only mid-afternoon but it might as well have been midnight with the way Luke's head was messing with him.  He was trying really hard to be the rational, reasonable guy that his band mates knew and loved but having Lenny out in the wilderness with a man who was undoubtedly in love with her had pushed his rationality over a cliff.   Jealously wasn't something that Luke had ever had to deal with.  Not since high school anyway.  He felt like an idiot.  Even after Duke had all but given his blessing the night before, Luke still felt. . . tense.   Here they come.  Mike interrupted his brooding and nodded out the large windows facing the back of the house.  Sure enough, two snowmobiles were pulling up out back.   Lenny disembarked and said something to Duke before entering the house through the back door.  Duke drove his sled towards the garage to put it away.   Hey guys! Lenny's face was red from the cold and she had snow stuck in her hair.  She took off her hat and gloves and started removing her coat.   How was it? Harrison bounded across the room and jumped onto the back of the sofa, eager for the recap.   Lenny laughed at him and Luke noticed that it was louder, more released than before.  Her smile was wide and her face radiant.  He thought she was beautiful before, but this was a whole new experience.   It was. . . perfect.  Lenny giggled again and the guys exchanged puzzled smiles.   Mike was the only one who seemed to not be surprised.  He grinned broadly and wrapped her into a hug.  Her arms encircled him in return and they shared a moment that Luke knew he'd never fully grasp.   So, what happens now? Blake frowned and crossed his arms.  Are you leaving the tour or what? Luke hadn't even considered that Lenny being able to return to snowboarding might mean her leaving their lives.   Of course not! Lenny exclaimed as her hug with Mike ended.  You can't get rid of me that easily.  Her eyes swung over to Luke and she said a thousand different things to him with that one look.  A recklessness burned on the edge of her irises and he realized that something in her had been awakened in the past few hours.  It was a definite turn on.   But, I have to fill you in on a few. . . unsavory details of my life.  Lenny made a face as she entered the kitchen.  You guys hungry? I'm starving, I need nutrients.   The band gathered in the kitchen and Lenny fixed them up with sandwiches.  Duke joined them after he had put the sleds away and Lenny calmly explained the details of her 'reckoning' as Duke had called it.  The group absorbed the information and came to the same collective opinion.  That Shane was the worst and Cody was the devil.   Luke hoped that he and Lenny would have a second chance at their conversation from the night before.  Having been filled in on the details of her relationship with Shane now, Luke could absolutely see how the two didn't compare.  He wasn't Shane, and he never would be.  He needed to make sure that Lenny understood that.   This probably changes a lot of things about Aspen.  Sway stated the obvious.   I still have to go.  Lenny threw a towel at Duke when he rolled his eyes.  Contractual obligations.  But I would still love it if you guys all joined me.  She looked around at them hopefully.   Of course well be there, mama.  Blake grinned mischievously.   Absolutely.  Sway agreed, linking eyes with Blake and mirroring his smile.   Are we gonna have a talk with Shane? Harrison asked, noticing his friends weird behavior.   Youre awesome at subtly, you know that? Blake closed his eyes in frustration.   What? Harrison asked, perplexed.   Are you coming too? Luke directed at Duke.   Nah, you guys got this.  I hate it up there, too many people.   Luke inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.  While he respected Duke and his position in Lennys life he couldnt help but feel like Dukes presence would keep he and Lenny from getting any closer.             They packed their bags that night and got ready to depart for the weekend in Aspen.  Duke would drive them all to the airport early the next morning.  Lenny was actually looking forward to the trip now, her conscience clear and her mind focused.  Shane and Cody may have held her back in the beginning but she had chosen to stay there.  Now she was back.   She stood in her room looking out over the dark mountains being lit by the moon.  She stretched her tight muscles and closed her eyes.  She started when she heard someone in the doorway.  It was Duke, again.  He looked a little more friendly than he had the night before in the garage.   You always did have the best view up here.  He nodded out the large, wall sized windows.   Lenny smiled, walking over to her bed and sitting on the edge.  She motioned with her head for Duke to join her.  She saw him consider it for a moment before relenting and sitting down.   When you coming back? Duke asked softly.   We have to leave for London right after Aspen.   So, youre still gonna be the assistant?  Yeah, for now.  Its really fun.  Lennys voice got wistful.  And theyre really good guys, I like being there for them.   Youve always been a good friend.  Duke looked down at his hands and then back out the window.   Ill come home after that.  Lenny leaned her shoulder against his, sensing his melancholy mood.   You dont have to promise anything right now.  Things can still change between now and then.  Duke pointed out.   Lenny let out a heavy sigh, Duke was right.  Anything could happen she supposed.   Ill call you.  She decided to promise instead.   Duke chuckled.  Good.  Thatll be nice.   The silence became comfortable, like it always did between them.  She felt him take a deep breath and he put an arm around her.  She eased into his embrace and closed her eyes.   For singing till his heaven fills,  T is love of earth that he instills,  And ever winging up and up,  Our valley is his golden cup,  And he the wine which overflows  To lift us with him as he goes  Duke's deep voice reciting his favorite poem to her, the poem he had given to her when she was still a child, along with all the heavy emotions they had shared with one another over the past few days, it was almost enough to make her heartbeat stop.  He did love her.  She had no doubts.   Thank you, Duke.  She whispered into his chest.   For what? Duke grunted.   For never giving up on me.  Lenny said quietly.             Duke didnt know what to say, so he didnt say anything.  He was content to hold her until she had fallen asleep.  He picked up her resting body and placed it carefully on the bed, pulling a blanket over her bare arms.  He stared down at her, wanting to be the one who could. . . just wanting to be the one.   Duke walked down the steps slowly and made his way to his room.  He crawled into his own bed in the dark and listened to the quiet of the house.  He enjoyed living alone but he would miss Lenny desperately.   Part of him hoped that she and Luke would run off and get married in Europe and never come home.  All he ever wanted was for her to have an unending adventure.  He knew that Luke could offer all of that and so much more.  Besides, Luke was totally in love with her.  She would be safe with him.             Spinning around quickly, Lenny shoved the last of her clothes in the dresser in her suite.  She knew she only had a few minutes before the band showed up at her room and she really didn't want to be unpacking her underwear in front of them.  She slid the empty duffel into the closet just as there was a knock on her door.   Her loud and rowdy group entered the room with more fanfare than was necessary but it still made her smile.   Check out the view you have! Sway whistled as he flopped himself onto her bed.   See? I told you.  Harrison said to Blake.  Her room is always better than ours.   And I told you its because shes better than us.  Blake replied.   And I told both of you to knock it off.  Lenny reprimanded with a smile.   The view was pretty stunning.  Buttermilk Mountain had been turned into a phenomenal course for the Winter X Games.  Hundreds of people had worked tirelessly on it for weeks now, constructing the perfect place for one of the most exciting competitions in the world.  Thousands of pounds of snow had been moved and rearranged to create both ideal and difficult terrain for the athletes.   Lenny and the guys had been some of the first to arrive.  She had a room to herself but the guys split three rooms between them.  She wasnt sure how that worked out and didnt ask.   Luke had his hands in his pockets and stood regarding her carefully.  They still hadn't had a moment alone together since their last very tense conversation.  She felt heat creep up her neck as his blue eyes flicked up and down the length of her.  She couldn't stand the wall that seemed to be between them and she impulsively threw her arms around his neck.   His arms wrapped around her immediately and he buried his face in her neck letting out a small groan, I missed you.   I missed you back, she whispered in his ear.   Um, do you guys want to be alone? Blake interrupted from behind her.   Luke let her go and smiled crookedly.  Lenny rolled her eyes at Blake and readjusted her hoodie as she turned around.   She walked to the dresser and grabbed their VIP passes she had gotten from Patrick and passed them out.  These will get you into all the events and the VIP tent.  She stepped back and put her hands in her back pockets as she further explained.  I have X Fest today and tomorrow.  Patrick stacked my schedule to appease as many sponsors as possible.  I have two interviews today, an hour in the autograph booth and a demo.  You guys can have free reign, just dont embarrass me.  She added with a grin, she knew they would be amazing, she had no doubts.  Not even about Sway.   Her phone made a chirp noise and she picked it up off the dresser glancing at the screen.  It was Cody, wondering if she was here yet.  Lenny put the phone in her pocket without bothering to reply.   Hey, when do we get to meet Shane? Harrison asked from his corner.   In a perfect world, never.  But chances are hes lurking around here somewhere.  Hes kind of a media whore.  Lenny replied sourly.   Were famous, too, Sway pointed out.   Not as famous as he is in this place, Lenny countered.  Why do you want to meet him at all?  No reason.  Blake elbowed Harrison before he could reply.   Lenny rolled her eyes, Just dont get into any trouble.  She moved toward the door, Cmon, let's go see who is here before I have get to work.   They hung out in the VIP lounge for a couple hours, rubbing shoulders with sportscasters, celebrities and the best athletes in the world.  The band knew a lot of the people there and it was sort of a mini reunion.  They visited with other artists who also happened to be fans of the X Games and made fast friends of those they didnt already know.   Nearly everyone was surprised to see Lenny, she had been notably absent in the last two years.  She was hugged and high-fived and congratulated on returning to the sport.  She downplayed the accolades and didnt really explain the reason for her attendance.   Her first interview only wanted her to talk about how exciting the Games were so far and who she thought would do the best today.  She smiled and answered honestly, complimenting all the talent that she had witnessed so far.  Fans had started to gather around the media tent, her appearance causing a stir.   When the interviewer announced Lenny was heading to the autograph booth next, the crowd moved in a wave that direction.  Lenny always like this part, she enjoyed talking to fans and taking pictures with them.  Especially the kids.  She signed photos and passed them to fans, deflecting questions about her return to the sport.  Some people had her sign their equipment or had even brought posters from home.  She was more than happy to accommodate them all, posing for pictures and giving hugs.   Afterward, she headed back to the VIP lounge to see her friends.  All of them were busy enjoying themselves and she felt good about that.  Lenny had been worried they might not fit it but realized that was a ridiculous assumption.  They fit in anywhere.   Luke approached her, looking bothered.  She frowned at his worried expression.   Whats up? She asked him, wondering when they would ever have a quiet moment alone together again.   I just talked to a guy fromI dont know, some sports thing.  And he said that your next interview will have Shane there.  He eyed her warily.   Lennys stomach gurgled uncomfortably.  She knew she would have to deal with him eventually so this wasnt that big of a surprise.  She just didnt want to do it on national television.  Typical Shane, still trying to intimidate her into shutting up.  She wouldn't be surprised if he had arranged it like this, he loved attention.   Im glad you told me.  Lenny smirked.  That wouldve been a shock.   Maybe you can get out of it.  Fake food poisoning or something.  Luke was trying to be helpful but Lenny knew this was something she needed to do.  She was angry with Shane for what he'd done.  Her fire was back and she was looking forward to giving Shane a good burn.   No.  She shook her head at Luke's suggestion.  Thanks.  But I think I got this.   She turned on her heel and strode back to the media tents, prepared to give the interview of a lifetime.             It was long ago and far away, but for Lenny, the memory crept back to her most vividly.  She had been fourteen when she had first lain on eyes on the smoldering hunk of athleticism that was Shane Brookings.  He was four years her senior, but had dominated the half-pipe circuit for the better part of his short career.  Tall, with wide, strong shoulders and rippling muscles, he looked too large to be so agile on a snowboard, yet he moved with a seductive fluidity.  His strength carrying him to record breaking heights and crossing boundaries of flight.  His square jaw and perfectly unshaven stubble gave him a roguish appearance that made girls swoon.   Lenny made it her purpose to show up on his radar.  It took a few years, she was just a kid to him in the beginning, but after her trip to the back country of Alaska she gained a little more media attention, and Shane took notice.  They flirted off and on for a couple of years, creating speculation in the sports world about them having super beautiful athletic babies.  And then one day it happened.  Shane decided he had to have her.   Looking back, Lenny realized there were several warning signs.  Shane was always way into his own body, constantly working out and taking offers to pose half naked for whatever magazine wanted him.  He would flirt shamelessly with every pretty girl who walked by; Lenny wrote it off to him having an outgoing personality.  Just a few weeks into them dating and Shane started to get weirdly controlling about who Lenny could and could not talk to.  She got an offer from Sports Illustrated to be in their swimsuit issue and Shane had pitched a fit.  She turned it down to appease him but then Cody had swooped in and taken the gig.  Lenny should have caught on right away.  But shed never been in a relationship so she really had nothing to compare it to.   Lenny knew it was unusual by the worlds standards to be a twenty-three year old virgin, but shed been busy having a life and never really thought about having sex.  It was there, in the back of her mind, she just assumed that when it was time she would know.  Completely confident in every decision shed made in her life thus far, it was normal for her.   So when Shane had started to pressure her into having sex the night before the biggest run in her career, Lenny balked at the idea.   No, Im not ready for that step.  And besides, I dont want a big distraction in my head for tomorrow.   They were sitting in her room, a small dorm-sized bedroom with two sets of bunks.  She and Cody were roommates with two other girls who had recently left because they had won their medals and wanted to go home.  Shane had started to make more frequent visits to her room to make-out.   Cmon, itll make you do even better tomorrow.  He whispered in her ear as his hand traveled from her knee up her thigh.   Lenny shoved his hand away and stood up.  She was not liking this side of Shane at all.   Theres no way for you to know that.  She frowned.  I dont want to, its not a discussion.   Shane put on his best puppy-dog face, trying again.   Please, baby, youre just so hot I can hardly keep my hands off you.  He stood up and pulled her close against his body.  I want you so bad and I love you so much.  He started kissing her neck.   Lenny shoved him away from her.  Knock it off.  Im serious, Shane.  She crossed her arms and her frown deepened.  This isnt happening.   Shane's face shifted to affronted and he put his hands on his hips, scowling at Lenny.  She stood firm, not sure what to expect.   What the hell, Lenny? Whats your problem? He barked, all sweetness leaving him.   Lenny narrowed her eyes. Im pretty sure Im not the one with the problem.  She grabbed her jacket and slipped it on.   Where are you going? He demanded, grabbing a hold of her arm.   She twisted free as she yanked open the door.  To get some fresh air, I suggest you do the same.   She left in a huff, slamming the door behind her.  Lenny stalked though the Village, calming down quickly.  She ran into a few Olympians she had just met that week and they invited her to join them for their evening activities.  She relaxed in the fun atmosphere watching other events and competitors.  She was feeling in a much better mood when she went back to her room to get rested before her own run the next day.   She opened the door and stopped in her tracks.  Her voice stuck in her chest as her eyes that never missed anything viewed the heart wrenching scene before her.   Cody's toned and tanned body was only in a bra and panties and she was hastily yanking a shirt over her head.  Shane was in his boxers and pulling his jeans up.  Their faces were flushed and they were still breathing heavy.  They must have justfinished Lenny felt her stomach turn as her brain tried to wrap around this blatant betrayal.   She finally found her voice.  It sounded strange and angry in her own ears.  She wondered what it sounded like to them.   You have got to be kidding me.  She stood still in the doorway, not wanting to enter the room and have to feel the remnants of their recent passions.   What did you expect? Cody glared at her, running her fingers through her caramel colored tresses to smooth out the tousle they'd just been through.  Youre such an effing tease.  Im just glad I could be there to fill in.  Didnt come in second this time.  She said smugly.   Lennys eyes widened at her friend's words.  Youre not seriously suggesting that this is okay?  Calm down, Lenny.  Dont make a big deal out of this.  Shane spoke to her like she was child as he pulled his shirt over his head.   Dont make a big deal? Are you serious? Her voice was starting to get louder and people walking by in the hallway were taking notice.  A small crowd started to gather a few feet away, listening in.   I needed a release, I gave you first dibs, and you declined.  I found it somewhere else.  You shouldnt be mad about this.  This is what you wanted, isn't it? Shane taunted.   Youre an asshole! Was all Lenny could get out.  She was losing her resolve and starting to crumble.  She couldnt believe what they had just done but what was even harder to swallow is that they were defending themselves.   I told Shane that you guys would probably never have sex.  Cody said haughtily.  That you have a hard time showing love.  That youre broken.  She let her words dig in.  But dont worry friend, I'm always happy to help out.   Lenny was going to be sick.  She could feel the bile rising in her esophagus and swallowed hard to push it down.  It didnt work; she ran to the bathroom a short distance down the hall, locked the door behind her, and wretched into the toilet.  Then she sat down on the floor and cried.   It had always been hard for Lenny to make friends.  With three older brothers she had gotten along with guys better.  Girls tended to not like her.  It didnt bother her too much, she had always had Cody.  But nowTears ran down her face, uncontrolled.  She had never felt so alone in her life.  Her family wasnt allowed in the Village and Duke was on an expedition and couldnt be reached.  She had no one.   Their words had done more than stung.  Lenny had always feared in the back of her mind that maybe romantic love wasnt something in her future.  What if Cody was right? What if she was broken?  That week had been the worst of Lennys whole life.  She crashed the next day, allowing Cody to take gold and propel her into superstardom.  The recovery from the accident had been slow.  Shane and Cody kept coming around, trying to see if she remembered what they had done.  Apparently they werent feeling as secure in their lusty decisions after the fact.  Lennys confidence was sapped.  She couldnt even rely on her own body to take her where she wanted to go.  She decided to focus on recovery, hoping Cody and Shane would tire of the daily torture and leave her alone.   As she made progress, Shane used her accident as another way to be in the spotlight.  He was constantly giving interviews about her well-being and their future together.  It didnt take too many weeks of that before Lenny understood why he was in a relationship with her in the first place.  It looked good.  It made him look even more attractive, he was using her to stay visible.  No appeal remained for her to return to snowboarding.   Two years flew by.  Shane moved to Wyoming, he wanted to move into the Lodge but his condition was that Duke move out.  Lenny declined that idea.  She was getting so tired of him.  Getting sick of all the fake I love yous and empty gestures.  She could feel herself growing colder and more distant with everyone around her.  Her atmosphere was suffocating her and she started to fear she would die if she didnt leave.   Snowboarding was more than a sport for Lenny.  It had been an extension of herself.  It offered a freedom that other sports lacked.  Her brothers said that it was her rebellious nature finding a home.  It made her feel limitless and challenged.  She hated the rules and propriety of growing up in an upper class family.  Snowboarding gave her an outlet, a way to express love, rage, passion and grief.  The mountain had been her canvas, the board her brush.  Losing her confidence in that had been devastating.  She was afraid that she would never feel at peace with herself again.   Not anymore.  She was back, and her nonconformity had been stifled for too long.  She had some catching up to do.   Lenny smirked to herself as she entered the media tent, instantly drawing attention to herself.  She smiled politely at the staff, shaking hands and exchanging greetings.  A little gal came over and fitted her with a mic and showed her which chair to sit in.   Wow, youre even pretty up close.  The girl giggled nervously, Lenny just smiled, remembering how graciously the guys dealt with the attention they received wherever they went and aimed to appear as comfortable as they always did.   She sat in the chair she was directed to and Brad, the interviewer, engaged her in small talk while they waited for Shane.  She and Brad had been on good terms since she had started to gain attention in her early teens.  He was apprised of all her success and failures and knew her family relatively well, too.  That was the thing about sportscasters, they stuck around the industry for a long time and made friends.  It gave them better interviews.   Theres been quite a bit of pressure on me to ask you some hard questions ever since it was announced you were going to be here.  Brad said, testing Lennys reaction.   You can ask me anything you want, Brad.  Lenny replied with a sincere smile, hoping he'd get the hint.   Brads eyebrows went up at the open door invitation.  Normally, a celebrity such as Lenny would have limits or guidelines set up at the beginning of the interview.  He smiled with intrigue at her unflinching response.   Lennys attention was drawn to the flurry of activity coming towards her.  Shane Brookings entered the tent and flashed everyone his dazzling smile.  The mic girl got so flustered she forgot her job and blushed a deep maroon.  Lenny hadnt seen Shane since the day before she'd had her interview with Carl.  He looked good.  Not great, but good.   He approached Lenny and Brad and coolly took his seat.  He had kept his dark hair trimmed short and had grown a nice goatee that showed off his angular jaw.  He was tall, well over six feet, his large, muscular frame engulfing the chair he sat in.  His eyes were pools of amber that glinted in the sunlight that peeked through the seams of the tent.   I wasnt sure youd show.  He raised an eyebrow at Lenny, obviously surprised to see her.   Lenny didnt reply, she just smiled politely and faced Brad.   So lets begin, Brad got the ball rolling, turning to speak into the camera.  Today at the Winter X Games we have snowboardings elite, the sweethearts of the sport.  Lenny Evans, eight time X Games gold medalist, once the darling of big mountain riding and Shane Brookings, reigning World Champion in the Half Pipe and current Olympic gold medalist.  Also, snowboardings most eligible bachelor.  The world thought you two were going to get married and ride off into the sunset on Burtons newest design but that hasnt happened.  How long since youve seen each other?  She left me about six months ago.  Shane answered quickly, not looking in Lennys direction.   Thats true, I did.  Lenny nodded, keeping her face flat.   Have you left the sport entirely? Brad directed at Lenny.   I thought I had, but I may be making a comeback.  She smiled coyly.   She noticed Shane tense up next to her.  So did Brad.   What do you think about that, Shane?  I thinkthats a pretty big decision and she should probably take it easy.  He chuckled nervously.  I mean, she had a pretty major wreck, it might take a while for her to get back to the level she was at.   Oh, Im just as good as I always was.  Lenny answered, relaxed and confident, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.   Is that why you guys decided to call it quits, difference of opinion? Brad questioned, his eyebrows bobbing up and down.   Yeah, sort of, Lenny answered before Shane could.  I shouldve ended it years ago.  He had the opinion that it was okay to sleep with my best friend and my opinion was that it was wrong.  She was laying the sarcasm on pretty thick and saw Brad swallow his grin.   She looked to Shane to voice his opinion on the matter; he was obviously blindsided.  He started stuttering, trying to come up with something to counter Lennys words.  But nothing would come out.   Is that true? Brad asked Shane.   Shane couldnt answer; he just stared at the ground.   There was speculation at the time of your wreck that you were distraught before approaching the chute.  Brad, realizing that Shane was worthless at this point, pointed back to Lenny.   Yeah, I had just caught them a few hours prior.  In my room.  She heard a collective gasp around the tent.   When you say them you mean Brad prodded, a light sheen of sweat was becoming visible by his hairline and Lenny knew she was standing on the edge of acceptable interview protocol.  She could practically hear Patrick-the-lawyer reading her retraction statement to the press now.  He'd probably cite exhaustion or something.   Shane and my best friend at the time, Cody Carmichael.   Lenny heard a screech from somewhere off camera but she didnt let it distract her.   That mustve been pretty awful.  Brad prodded Lenny to elaborate.   You know, it really was.  The worst part was how they made me feel less than myself.  It took me some time to really come to terms with that.  She glanced sideways at Shane but he was still mute and paralyzed.   Shane has been acting like you were the one who broke his heart.  Brad was trying to get Shane to react to something, anything.   Weird, right? Lenny made a face and Brad couldnt stop himself from laughing.  I feel bad for all the girls hes ever suckered into believing his sob story just so he can get pity sex.   Cmon, Lenny.  Shane had suddenly come back to life.  We dont have to do this here.  Lets go talk somewhere in private.   Lenny ignored him and kept her focus on Brad.   So you think you might be coming back to the sport in a full time capacity? Brad asked, putting every ounce of professionalism into his voice as he could muster.   I havent made any decisions yet.  But its something I am considering.  Lenny answered with a smirk.  Im still damn good.   Think you could win a medal in two years? Brad speculated.   If youre asking if I think Im better than the gold medal defender, Cody Carmichael, then Lenny lifted her chin in defiance as she answered.  Yes.  I am better than her, in a lot of ways.   Shane, completely humiliated, yanked off his mic and stormed out of the tent.  Lenny smile apologetically at Brad.   So, all good news here today.  Brad turned to look into the camera.  Lenny Evans is considering making a return to snowboarding in time for the Winter Olympics and if todays interview is any indication of her passion, the rest of the world better start paying attention.   The red light on the camera went off and Lenny got up to leave.  Brad stopped her and shook her hand.   Its good to have you back, Lenny, Brad said sincerely.  And if you want to trash any other ex-boyfriends on TV please call me first.   Okay, will do, Lenny laughed.   Luke greeted her in the VIP tent with a huge hug.   That was amazing.  Luke was positively beaming.   You dont think it was a little over the top? Lenny asked with a touch of anxiety.  Sure, it felt good at the time but she was aware there could be significant fallout.   Are you kidding me? I make my living by being over the top.  I am the foremost expert on what over the top is.  He smiled at her again.  You were completely within reason.   Thanks.  She breathed a little sigh of relief.  She had dealt with Shane, now she would have to deal with Cody.  Lenny knew there would be trouble after she labeled her as the whorey, second-rate best friend.   I think Blake and Sway were a little disappointed they didnt get to talk to Shane first.  Luke said as he directed her back to the hotel.   Oh, is that right? Lenny laughed.  What did they think they were gonna do, rough him up? She laughed again at the idea.  She allowed Luke to lead her back to his room without really thinking about it.   He slid the key card into the door and let her inside.  His room was smaller than hers.  Just one bed and a bathroom.   You and Mike sharing the King-size? Lenny joked.   No, I got my room to myself for the first time ina while.  He finished slowly.   I bet thats gotta be nice.  Lenny smiled and slipped off her hoodie, revealing a white tank underneath.  She sat down on the bed, playfully bouncing a little.  She watched Luke take off his outerwear.   She hadnt really looked at him yet since theyd arrived.  He was so fit and lean, his muscles flexed and moved under his skin and were clearly visible beneath his shirt.  His tattoos peeked out from under his long sleeves as he pushed them up and sat down on the chair.  His blonde hair was a little longer than when they had first met, she noted as he raked it back off his face with his fingers.  He had grown a short beard that only defined his chiseled features even more.  His crystal blue eyes were crinkled at the sides, as if in perpetual smile.  Her stomach did a back flip.  Luke Casey could still take her breath away.   She wasnt sure what to say so she waited in the silence.  Hoping Luke would speak.   After several minutes, Luke turned his terrible blue eyes on Lenny.  Those eyes that had the power to make her heart stop.   Im here for you this week.  Not the events, not the celebrities, not the weather.  Just you.  Whatever you need from me, you have it.   Lenny bit the inside of her cheek.  She had been keeping him at a distance and yet here he was, offering more for her to misuse if thats what she chose.  Her heart beat fast as she began to grasp his unrestricted devotion to her.  It was a lot stronger than she had realized.   I just got my head back on Lenny started slowly, she didnt want to hurt Luke but she wanted to be honest with him.  Im sort of just starting to feel comfortable in my own skin. I still cant give you an absolution on what that means for us.  She watched his expression go from thoughtful to forlorn.   I really like you, Luke.  Lenny wanted to grab him and kiss him.  But, logistically, how do you see this playing out? He frowned at her and she continued.  Youre a rock star and you have this hugely successful job that requires you to be gone for long periods of time.  And Im considering going back to competing which also requires a lot of travel.  She took a breath.  We might not see much of each other after the rest of this tour.   We could make it work.  He said moving to sit next to her on the bed.   Lenny nodded, knowing that was a possibility.   I dont think it would be smart for either of us to promise something that huge before we know if thats something we really want.   Luke took one of her hands in both of his.  Are giving me the lets just be friends talk? He smiled, only half-kidding.   Lennys eyes widened.  No, not at all.  I just think we should enjoy what we have right now and not put so much pressure on what might be.   Luke looked down at her hand and chuckled.  Maybe Blakes right, maybe we are just a couple of hipsters.   Lenny took her other hand and touched his face, directing his eyes back up to hers.  Ill tell you what this is.  She whispered.  Im your girl, and youre my guy.   When his gaze traveled to her lips she felt her pulse quicken.   I really enjoyed watching your interview.  Luke said slowly, his eyes flicking back and forth from her eyes to her lips.   Oh, yeah? Lenny raised an eyebrow in question.   Yeah, Luke leaned in fractionally.  I've never seen that reckless side of you before, it was kinda hot.   Lenny smiled slowly as Luke leaned closer.  You thought it was hot?  His lips finally touched hers and an electric current ripped through her body.  He delicately and determinedly worked his lips against hers.  She grabbed his shirt in both hands and pulled him closer.  One of his arms slipped around her back while the other cupped her face, directing their course of action.  The kiss heated quickly and her body responded.  Her hands found themselves twisting into his hair, pulling him closer.  Lenny had only been kissed a handful of times in her life and no one ignited her the way Luke did.   She let an involuntary whimper when Luke slowly ended the kiss and stood up.  He took a steadying breath and gave her a knowing smile.   We have to be careful, he whispered in his gravelly voice.  I havent kissed you in a long time and Im afraid I could ask for too much too fast.   Lennys stomach trembled as she understood what he was implying.  And she agreed, she hadnt kissed him like that in weeks and it was like someone had set her lips on fire.  She would have a hard time saying no.  Unlike with Shane, where her thoughts never progressed past kissing, Luke made her want to throw caution to the wind.   She waited for her heart to return to a normal rhythm before she cleared her throat and stood up.  Maybe we should get some dinner after my demo.  My dad is in town and he wanted to see you guys again.   Thats a really good idea, Luke nodded.  Knowing your dad is around will help keep my thoughts where they should be.  He grinned and then winked.  Well, for the most part.             The table at the lodge-style restaurant was long and wide, comfortably fitting the group of seven.  The lights were low, and tiny candles inside glass lamps created small pools of radiance on the table cloth.  Lenny looked around at the faces that she had become so fond of over the past few months.  Blake and Harrison, Sway and Mike.  Luke.  Her father.   Her gaze locked on Luke sitting across from her, his affection for her evident.  It was less frightening than it was in the beginning, but it still left Lenny lightheaded and confused.  Luke was carrying on a conversation with her father easily.  Not something many people could do.  Bruce Evans was always suspicious of those who had the potential to hurt his family.  It was part of the reason Lenny had a hard time fully trusting someone, its how she was raised.   She looked at her father.  He was a good man.  He had always encouraged Lenny to follow her dreams but he never made her decisions for her.  He liked Luke.  Lenny could tell by his laugh and the way he listened to Lukes stories.  They had a lot in common, both from Boston, Celtics fans, avid fisherman, hated the same politicians.  Lenny found herself picturing future holidays with both of these men, her mother and brothers.  Was there a future there? With the rock star? Lenny didnt know how that could work.  Maybe the details didnt matter right now.   Youre quiet, Lenna.  Does your food taste okay? Her father interrupted her thoughts.  His face was relaxed and not pinched and worried like it had been for the past two years.   Yeah, its goodI was just thinking.  Lenny answered softly, not wanting to break the quiet ethereal spell that had seemed to settle over the table.   What were you thinking about, honey? Her father genuinely wanted to know.   I got on a board today.  She let the words hang in the moment.   Her father sat up a little straighter in his chair and a smile began to stretch across his face.  He was proud.  It was always obvious when he was proud.   And she did great, Luke added.   You got to see it? Her father asked in an excited whisper.   It was just a short demo ride.  Lenny couldnt hold back her delight, But it felt really good.   The guys started to bombard her with questions, suddenly sensing that the subject was no longer taboo.  They knew Lennys dad didnt know she had been riding again so they had been trying to be careful.  Apparently they had a lot they had been wondering about.  Lenny gladly answered their queries and told some stories she hadnt thought about in a while.             Luke loved seeing Lennys face glow with enthusiasm as she finally spoke about her most cherished pastime.  He could never imagine giving up music for anything.  Her return to snowboarding was obviously liberating.   Its because of you.  Lennys father leaned over and spoke to Luke without the others overhearing.  Dont think I havent noticed the remarkable change in my daughter since you entered the picture.  He took a drink of his water and replaced his napkin on his lap.  I hope you stick around.   Luke watched Lennys bright expression and replied, I intend to.  He knew, without knowing how, that the love he felt was so much more than anything hed felt before.   He also knew that it was Duke, and not himself, that had pushed her to trust herself again.  That gnawing feeling was still in the pit of Lukes stomach.  Duke and Lenny had a connection that couldnt be explained and Luke didnt know if he would ever be able to fill that role.  Duke had boldly encouraged Luke to pursue Lenny; he seemed pleased with the arrangement.  But Luke had been able to sense Dukes underlying feelings for Lenny, even if Lenny didnt know about them.  And wasnt it ultimately Lennys decision in the end anyway? Or could two men, both in love with the same woman, just decide between them who would get her?  Lenny wasnt a piece of property that could be passed back and forth, exchanging one master for another.  She would have to decide.  She was the only one who had that power.   Luke looked at her from across the table and tried to relax.  She was his girl right now.  He chose to focus on that.        14    All Apologies      When dinner had ended, Lenny said farewell to her father and climbed into the shuttle van with the rest of the band.  She slid the door closed behind her and took a seat in the middle next Luke, who rolled his eyes at the argument taking place behind him.  Lenny looked over his shoulder and saw Mike with his arms crossed over his chest and a glower on his face.  Sway was against the window, his focus on his cell phone.  And poor Harrison, squashed between them.   The van was quiet as it bumped along the road, returning them to the hotel.  Lenny wasn't sure why it seemed so tense and awkward; obviously something had happened when she wasn't looking.   I didn't say you were hiding anything.  I just asked a question.  That's all.  Mike broke the silence.  Lenny felt Luke sigh heavily next to her.   It's none of your business, so back off! Sway snapped.   Lenny's head whirled around in surprise but Luke put his hand on her knee and signaled her to not get involved.  The van stopped and Luke gestured for Lenny to exit quickly.  The rest of the guys bailed out behind them.   Sway- Mike tried again.   Seriously, Mike! Stop being so frickin' insecure! Sway cut him off.  I have a freaking friend! Can't I have a one freaking friend outside of this stupid band?!  Lenny stood stock still.  The guys argued sometimes but this was intense, even for them.   Okay, Sway and I are going to see if we can catch that half-pipe shit.  Blake calmly put an arm around the bassist's shoulders and directed him away from the group.  Sway threw a final glare in Mike's direction.   He's overreacting.  Mike tried to defend himself but Luke just shook his head at his friend.   You guys push each other's buttons, you always have.  Luke placed a hand on the small of Lenny's back.   Mike's brows pushed together and his mouth formed a hard line.  Harrison clapped a hand down on Mike's shoulder, drawing his attention.   C'mon, man.  Harrison's eyes filled with compassion.  Let's take a walk.  Mike's jaw clenched momentarily before he relented and followed his friend.   Lenny looked up at Luke, completely confused.  What was that all about?  Luke directed her back to the hotel and opened the door for her.  They have a rocky history.  Some wounds take longer to heal than others.  They'll be fine, Blake will talk Sway down and Harrison will figure out what's eating at Mike.  They'll all be best friends again in no time.   Lenny frowned, Luke seemed pretty sure of the outcome but she had never seen Sway that pissed off before.  They walked to her hotel room and she opened the door, still thinking about the scene she'd just witnessed.  Luke sat on the couch and patted the seat next to him so she'd join him.   Don't let it worry you.  They can act like they want to kill each other sometimes, but its short lived.   I guess I have to take your word for it.  Lenny pursed her lips.  I don't know them as well as you do. . . obviously.  That last thought troubled her.  She had been under the impression that she'd gotten close to these guys, but there was still so much she didn't know.  She rested against Luke's side as he switched on the TV, she would probably never know them as well as Luke did.   You said. . .  Lenny bit the inside of her cheek, not sure if she should allow her curiosity to get the better of her.  You said something about old wounds. . . ?  Luke sighed and raised his eyebrows.  Yeah. . . a few years ago, Mike had a girlfriend.   Lenny adjusted herself on the sofa and laid down with her head on Luke's thighs.  She folded her hands across her stomach and waited patiently for him to continue.   Her name was Ilsa.  She was a model from Berlin.  Luke rubbed his stubble with one hand and placed the other hand across Lenny's.  Mike was crazy in love with her but she was. . . undecided.  She had a problem with him using and she went to Sway for. . . advice.   Oh.  Lenny breathed as she followed that train of thought.   Yep.  Long story short, Sway and Ilsa got closer than friends and she dumped Mike for him.  Mike overdosed the next day.   Damn.  Lenny had no idea.  No wonder they had issues.  That would be hard to move past.  She felt guilt cramp in her stomach having the information inside of her now.   Hey, don't feel bad.  Luke ran his finger across her hairline.  They would've told you eventually, you're part of the band.   It's so personal, I feel like I shouldn't know.   That's because you have a good heart.  Luke smiled down at her and Lenny involuntarily blushed.   He stared down at her for few minutes, not speaking, a look a pure contentment on his face.   I like this.  He said quietly.  His deep voice vibrating through his chest and into Lennys shoulder.   Whats that? Lenny asked.   Just being here with you.   Lenny closed her eyes and smiled.  She liked this too.  Finally, after all the drama that had occurred during the past few days, they had time to just. . . be.  Together.   His hand traveled down hers and his fingers worked their way into her own.  They had nowhere to go, no one expecting them.   What? Luke asked her.   Lenny opened her eyes.  What?  He grinned at her, Youre smiling.  I wanted to know why.   I guess Im just happy.  Lenny answered honestly.   Youre not gonna jump up and run away from me? Luke teased.   Nope.  She chuckled lightly.  Not today.             Luke was just about to say something when there was a knock on the door, interrupting their cozy moment.   Lenny sat up and went to answer it.  Luke watched her move with more self assurance than before.  Getting her back to the sport she loved was still multiplying in subtle improvements.  Luke had to wonder if he could handle all of Lenny at the top of her game.  He sure wanted to try.   Lenny opened the door and Harrison stood before her, eyes wide.   Whats up, Harry? Lenny asked and Luke smiled at how sweet she was to his friends.  He got off the couch and joined her at the door.   I thought maybe I should come and get you.  Harrisons voice was nervous and Luke suppressed a chuckle.  Codys calling you out.   What do you mean? Lenny's eyebrows drew together.   She finished her event and set a new world record and shes challenging you to come out and beat it.  Harrison was positively giddy with excitement.  Shes really working up the crowd.   Thats ridiculous, Harrison.  Im not registered for an event.  Lenny was shaking her head.  Luke rested his hand on her back, letting her know he was there.   Maybe you should try to talk to her, Harrison shrugged.   I was gonna have to deal with it eventually.  Lenny rolled her eyes as she grabbed her coat and hat.             The air outside was electric as Lenny made her way through the crowd.  With the sun down it had grown considerably colder than it had been that afternoon.  The sky was clear with stars making sharp pin pricks in the night sky.   Lenny made her way up to the small press booth at the top of the X Course.  It was a long walk and she had time to get an idea of what she would say to Cody.  She would probably have to apologize for slandering her to the media.  She again pictured  Patrick, paperwork in hand.   The crowds started out overcharged and exuberant but as Lenny trekked through the terrain to the top of the hill, they quieted considerably.  Luke and Harrison were flanking her.  It was eerie, Lenny noted, like they were all watching her walk fatefully to her demise.  She laughed off the thought internally.  Sports always brought out the dramatics in people.   As she approached the booth she recognized Brad from earlier, Cody of course and Shane, not surprisingly.  They would have to provide a united front to the public, Lenny supposed.  A handful of others stood around and nearby, either with the media or with the X Games organization itself.  Sway, Mike and Blake waited with their arms crossed, whatever previous quarrel they may have had was forgotten in this moment and they were once again united.   Lenny met Codys eye contact and felt a twinge of guilt for having betrayed her friend earlier that day.  Cody had betrayed her long ago, but Lenny had always hoped she was just little better than that.  Turns out, she wasnt.  She couldnt go back now, none of them could.  What Shane and Cody had done was irreversible, Lenny could never trust them again.  Maybe someday shed work on the forgiveness aspect of it, but not yet.   What do you want Cody? Lenny addressed her former friend.   You said you were better than me earlier today.  Cody answered with a smugness Lenny knew was completely genuine.  I want you to prove it.   Cody, Im not registered in any events.  I havent qualified for anything.  Lenny tried to speak slowly, like she was explaining the facts to a small child.  I know youre pissed but you cant just expect me to strap in and compete.   Actually, Cody crossed her arms, All events are done for the evening and my good friend Grant, here, said we can run the course.  Just you and I.   Lenny looked at the course manager whose face was bright red.  He nodded and looked down sheepishly.  Cody could manipulate anyone, Lenny thought, her face twisting in disgust.  She glanced up at Shane who had positioned his large frame behind Cody like he was her muscle.  Lenny looked around at the band who had taken up positions of support around her.  This is sad, its like the jocks against the band geeks all over again.   Unless all that stuff you said today was just a lie, Cody baited her.  So that was her play, Lenny mused.  If Lenny didnt take the challenge, than everything Lenny had accused them of earlier that day would look like a lie, tarnishing Lennys integrity with the press and her fans forever.   Lenny sighed in resignation.  Whether or not she was ready for this, it was going to happen.   You dont have to do anything you dont want to do.  Luke was talking to her now.  You dont have to prove anything to anyone.  We know the truth.   Yeah, Harrison added, We know that youre better than this hussy.   Cody frowned at his word.  Hussy? What, is this the 1800s? She rolled her eyes.  Idiot.   Hey! Blake snapped, He may be an idiot, but hes our idiot!  This was quickly turning into a television sitcom, Lenny noted.  She needed to get a handle on her guys.  She turned her back to Cody and grouped them in a huddle.   I can do this, she whispered with excitement.  She was near giddy with anticipation.  I can beat her.   Lenny, you havent competed in almost three years.  Im sorry, but a couple of good runs down the hill at home arent the same thing.  Sway patiently pointed out.  Lenny appreciated his concern, it was a side of Sway that he didnt show often and it was kind of sweet.   What would Duke say if he were here? Mike wanted to know.   Lenny considered that for a minute before a wide smile spread across her face.  Hed tell me to kick her ass.   Luke winked at her and nodded his approval.  Then, kick her ass.   Lenny faced Cody again.  I dont have any of my equipment so Ill have to borrow someones.  Lenny was addressing the crowd more than Cody.  She took pleasure in the shocked look that sprang to Cody and Shanes faces.  They obviously had expected her to back out.  How little they remembered of who she really was.   Fellow athletes started to outfit her with everything she would need; a board, goggles, gloves, boots.  Lenny was touched by their words of encouragement and anticipation for the upcoming race.   What, exactly do you have to do to win? Luke asked as she put on her borrowed gear.  She heard the anxiety that he was trying to hide and it made her smile.  Luke had never seen her compete before and she was looking forward to showing off just a little bit.   The course has variable terrain, with berms and gap jumps, turns, drops and steep and flat sections.  Basically, everything.  Whoever gets to the bottom first, wins, she grinned at him.   You sure youre ready for this? He raised an eyebrow at her.   Lenny looked around at the crowd, a familiar buzzing pressure in the back of her skull.  Their faces were full of wonder and excitement and she was feeling it.  While back country riding was indeed her forte, performing for an audience was her guilty pleasure.  She enjoyed knowing she was the best and knowing she was going to completely dominate her opponent.  The fact that it was Cody and that Lenny had finally come to terms with what she and Shane had done, made it that much more exhilarating.   Normally, snowboard cross was run in the daylight with four riders at a time on the course.  It was way past dark and spotlights had been turned on in order to light the run.  It would still be tricky, blind spots everywhere.  Lenny was even more confident in her ability to conquer.  She had a connection with the snow and her board that shed never been able to explain.  It was as if she could feel the ground change before it actually happened.   She had the advantage.   I got this.  She winked at Luke.  Youre about to see something amazing.  She wasnt trying to be cocky, she was being honest.             Luke was incredibly turned on by Lennys attitude.  Sometimes girls put on a front to look tough but there was nothing fake about what Lenny was feeling.  Hed seen her do things with ease that trained professionals struggled to accomplish.  He was proud that she was willing to call herself his girl when she was as wild and untamed as the mountains she came from.   He impulsively grabbed her face with his mittened hands and kissed her lips passionately.  A loud roar broke out from the observers and Luke realized that their relationship had just gone public.  He had been so careful to protect it, not wanting Lenny to get caught in the tabloids cross hairs.  But it was out now.  Cameras flashed and the TV crews scrambled to get a better angle.  He pulled away from Lenny and tried to downplay what had just happened.   Lenny smiled at him, her crooked half-smile that said everything would be fine.  She turned and waved to the crowd and cameras, blowing them kisses.   The girl he had met months before, the one with the carefully guarded heart and a past full of painful secrets had all but disappeared.  Lenny had been a mystery wrapped inside a riddle and somewhere along the way, Luke had cracked the code.  He knew that to share his life of crazy travel and hard work he would have to find a partner who was strong and could adapt to changing situations.  She stood before him now, a bundle of outerwear and a smile that lit the sky.   He walked with her to the chute, his nerves melting away.  They were replaced with a shiver, not from the cold, but from the clarity his heart had just experienced.  Lenny had to be in his life for the remainder of it.   Luke kissed her one last time before heading to the finish line.  He promised to be there when she came in first.  Sway and Blake went with him while Mike and Harrison stayed at the top to send her off.             Arent you afraid youre gonna choke? Cody sneered at Lenny, You know, like last time? Her grey eyes were flat and cold, and Lenny found it sad that eyes identical to Duke's could be so foreign.   Im sorry it has to come down to this Cody, Lenny responded coolly, But Im gonna crush you.  Lenny lowered her goggles and covered her face with her mask, sealing out the cold.   Yeah, youre not a nice person.  Harrison added his own dig.  He wasnt very good at trash talking.  It was really best if he stuck to lead guitar, Lenny thought.   Whatever.  Cody mumbled and lowered her goggles.   The pressure in the back of Lennys head had grown to a full scale roar in her ears.  It drowned out the crowd and Mike and Harrisons final words of encouragement.   She had an uncanny ability to separate herself from the rest of the world when she focused really hard.  She could create a mental barrier, where only she and the task at hand existed.  Thats where the pressure, the buzzing, came from.  She relaxed her mind and enclosed herself in the moment.  This was it.  She completely blocked out everything around her and took a deep, steadying breath.  She felt a smile spread across her face underneath her mask and waited.             The start signal rang through the air and the two riders took off.  Mike and Harrison strained their necks with the other screaming audience members, trying to get a good view.  The girls dipped and disappeared and then reappeared, twisting and flying down the slope.   Holy crap.  Harrison muttered under his breath and Mike laughed out loud.             Lenny could feel the perfect snow bend under her board and she almost laughed at how easy the course was.  She could feel the curve beneath her and anticipated the jump ahead.  She knew she had reached quite a height as her board made contact with the snow again.  She saw Cody in her peripheral vision as she tried to cut across Lennys path.  Lenny just slid to the side and shot past her.             Luke couldnt see a lot from his vantage point at the bottom but he could hear the rise and fall of the audiences reaction to what was happening.  He caught a glimpse of Lenny, flying high and he was reminded of her nickname 'Bird. ' She seemed lighter than air.  It was as if coming back to earth was a challenge and she belonged among the stars.             Lennys speed was increasing.  She crouched lower, gaining more momentum, knowing it was dangerous and knowing she could handle it.  Cody wasnt even close.  Lenny hadnt seen her in a few turns.  The pressure in Lennys head compressed and exploded in a brilliant star burst in her mind's eye as she took the last jump.  I love my life.  She had enough height and speed so she threw in an elegant stalefish, grabbing the board behind her back heel with her back hand and stretching out her body in the air.  You know, for fun.   The crowd erupted, finally registering in her awareness.  She landed easily and had to quickly slow herself as she crossed the finish so as not to hit the barriers.   Luke was with her in seconds, hugging her and yelling along with the crowd.  Lenny removed her goggles and face mask and kissed him.   Thirty seconds after Lenny had landed, Cody finally crossed the finish line.   Lenny unhooked the bindings on her boots and walked over to Cody.   Good race.  Lenny stuck out her hand, she hoped this would end Codys ridiculous vendetta.   Cody unhooked her bindings and picked up her board.   C'mon, Cody, we used to be friends.  Lenny tried to reach out to her, wondering if there was even anything salvageable left in their relationship.   We haven't been friends in a long time.  Cody clipped angrily.  It should've been me that Duke coached, he was my uncle.  It should have been me with all the sponsorships and the popularity.  You never would have even tried snowboarding if I wouldn't have invited you.  And this is how you repay me? Some friend you are.   Cody, this whole thing was your idea.  I have no idea how you can continue blaming me for your shortcomings.  It isn't my fault.   Stay away from me.  Cody spun around and stalked away.   Geez, sore loser.  Luke said from beside her.  Lenny shrugged.  She couldnt change Cody.  She had met her challenge and had beaten her at her own game.  What more did Cody want?            Lennys time wasnt an official recording because it wasnt an official race.  But that didnt matter, it still made headlines the next morning.  Well, that and her now public relationship with Luke Casey.   Suddenly, it seemed, the crowds realized that rock stars were among them and the guys were inundated with autograph and picture requests.  Lenny was proud of the guys.  They never expected special treatment or attention but when it happened, they always handled it with class.  Giving each fan eye contact and listening to them gush.  Especially Luke, he could make whoever he was talking to feel like that was the most important conversation he was going to have all day.   The entire next day was busy for all of them.  Lenny had two interviews to do and a few more stops at X Fest for the sponsors.  And the guys were the newest attraction.  Cody and Shane kept out of the ruckus as much as possible.  Lenny felt a little bit bad for embarrassing Cody the night before but Cody had asked for it.  Right?  During both of her interviews, Lenny was asked about her and Lukes relationship and she just smiled as a reply.  That wasnt the publics business.  Her feelings for Luke were definitely growing but he deserved to hear those words from her firsthand, not from a sound bite.   The sponsors went gaga over her performance the night before and started to throw more deals at her.  Lenny deferred them to Patrick, choosing to make those kinds of business decisions when the tour was finished.  She didnt want to overbook herself again.  She was feeling more in control of her life than she had in a long time.  It seemed that the downward spiral she had feared had leveled out into smooth riding.   As more of the X Games events wrapped up that night, Lenny snuggled close to Luke in the Athlete's Lounge at the Inn.  The Lounge was nearly vacant, just a few people here and there.  It was a nice place to relax since media and civilians werent allowed.   Lenny was happy.  Not ecstatically or anything.  Just regular, normal, happy.  She liked having Luke with her for her important life stuff.  She wanted him to stay forever.   I dont have any obligations tomorrow.  Lenny said quietly, her fingers making a trail across the top of his strong hands.   Mm-hm.  Luke mumbled in her soft hair, his eyes closed.   We could leave tomorrow if you want.  Lenny added.   Where do you wanna go? Luke was only half-listening to her.   Lenny didnt know.  She didnt have a plan.  She just had an impulse, a feeling, and acted on it.  All she knew is she wanted to be with Luke, on another adventure.   Just somewhere with you.  Was all she could think of to answer.   Ill go anywhere with you.  Luke said slowly his voice rough with an emotion Lenny couldn't define.             Luke didn't have a word for what he felt in her presence.  He had known for a while now that Lenny was the one.  His one.  The one he wanted to be tangled up with forever.  She was his exception.  And he dared to hope he could be hers.        15    Glycerine      It had been a long time since Duke had considered getting drunk.  Years, in fact.  But as he watched the coverage of Lenny flying high at the X Games, he thought about it.   He sighed and clicked off the TV.  It wasnt the fact that she was back, the center of a whirling media frenzy.  It wasnt that she had just made his niece look like a chump.  It was that kiss she had shared with the rock star.  Duke didnt realize how much seeing something like that could hurt.   He checked the clock on the wall, it was too early for bed and too late to go back out.  He shoved himself into a standing position and made his way to the front door.  Maybe a drive in the mountains would help clear his head.             Being back on the tour was different for Lenny than it had been a few months ago.  She couldnt run errands anymore because the anonymity was gone.  Not only did the press know her name but they kept plastering her face all over everything.   Carl was not pleased.  He hadnt said anything to her but she knew by the look hed given her when they arrived in London that he was pissed.   At least Im not cross-eyed in this one.  Lenny observed the cover of a paper tabloid they were passing around backstage at the venue.  They didn't chill on the buses like before because they were rentals for the overseas tour and Carl was afraid theyd trash them.  So during their down time they hung out backstage or in the hotel suite.   I didnt think the last one was too bad, I mean, besides the face you were making.  Mike joked dryly as Lenny passed him the magazine.   Im sorry about that.  Luke wouldnt stop apologizing.  Lenny had told him that she was fine with it, it's not like she'd never been famous before.  These were just different circumstances, the same rules applied.  The media would hound you and try to find a reason to hate you and then move on when someone prettier or crazier came along.   Dont worry so much.  She waved it off.  Really, its not that big of a deal.  I don't forget important things, like underwear, when I leave the house.  Im pretty boring, theyll move on eventually.   Ten minutes, Carl stuck his head into the dressing room.   The guys gathered themselves and headed for the stage area.  Luke kissed Lenny lightly on the lips before leaving.  She planned on waiting until they got situated before making her way through the crowd and joining Greg in the sound booth.   She was getting ready to exit the dressing room when Carl stopped her.  She reversed her trajectory as his imposing presence demanded to have a conversation.  He shut the door behind him.  Crossing his arms over his chest, he let out what Lenny could only assume was a snort.   So how pissed are you? Lenny asked, her mouth ticking up on the side.   I told you that under no circumstances were you allowed to sleep with any of them.  His voice was restrained but the veins in his neck were pulsing at his pent up anger.  He was more red than Lenny had ever seen him and she had a fleeting thought in regards to his heart health.   Is that all your mad about? Lenny asked cautiously.   That was the deal! Carl barked.   Well, then we dont have a problem.  Lenny said diplomatically, softening her features in an attempt to calm him down.   What? Carl snarled with a glare.   We havent slept together.  Lenny stated matter of fact and stuck her hands in her pockets.   What? Carl asked again with less roar.   Carl, Im not like other girls, you should know that by now.  Lenny said patiently, the same tone she had used on her father many times.  Luke and I are not having sex.  We havent had sex.  And we arent planning on having sex.  I have kept my word.   Carl did a combination squint and grimace.  He paced back toward the door and then back to Lenny.  But you guys aretogether.   Yes, Carl.  Were dating.  I like him and he likes me.  I realize its unusual in this day in age for two people to just enjoy one another without getting naked but thats just how weird we are.   Carl almost smiled.  How long before?  For crying out loud, Carl! Lenny exclaimed, Im not thinking about that and if I were I wouldnt discuss it with my boss.   Carl, satisfied with her answer, moved to leave and he looked over his shoulder.  Good to have you back, by the way.   Lenny shook her head.  That guy.   She resumed her trek to the sound booth hoping she hadn't missed too much.  The crowd was on its feet as the band played its opening song.  Lenny slid into the sound booth and Greg gave her a cursory nod.  She had missed this.  The energy that reverberated between the band and the fans was breathtaking.   The guys had warned Lenny that the overseas crowds were different than the ones Stateside.  They were right.  They were even crazier, if that was possible.  Not an angry crazy or a dangerous crazy.  It was more like their love for the music was completely uninhibited.  In a word, it was beautiful.   They hadnt had time to rehearse before flying into Heathrow and only had a small sound check that afternoon.  But they were on.  Lenny was continuously blown away by how effortless they made it all seem.   Luke was magnetic on stage.  The women literally threw themselves at him.  Harrison kept kicking panties off the stage.  Sway would sometimes grab a pair and hang them off the neck of his bass, but that only encouraged more throwing of undergarments.  Lenny used to be amazed at the shamelessness of the women but now it didnt even phase her.  It also seemed to not phase Luke.  He never acknowledged the suggestive antics of his female fans.   Lenny lost herself for a moment in the haze that was Luke Casey.  She had never felt for anyone like how she felt for him.  He was strong, dependable, sexy and all those things girls dream about in the perfect guy.  But there were many other things that Lenny knew about him now that the rest of the world probably never would.  Like, he also had this tiny scar behind his left ear that hed gotten when he was seventeen while he was windsurfing with Harrison in Malibu.  And he got too emotionally invested in the contestants on reality shows.  And he sang the wrong words to popular songs to make Lenny laugh.  He didnt pretend to have it all figured out, he was constantly striving to make himself a better person.   Somehow, amidst the insanity of being a hugely successful musician, he hadnt let the fame get to him.  He was genuine and humble.  In a world full of flakes, Luke Casey was the real deal.   And for some reason that Lenny hadnt yet deciphered, he wanted to be with her.  He didnt just like spending time with her, he acted like she was a vital part of his every day existence.  And she felt the same about him.  It was strange, she had never believed that Shane loved her, no matter how many times he said it.  But she knew, without question, that Luke loved her.  It was in everything he said and did, the way he talked to her, how he touched her, leaving no room for doubt.   Lenny was afraid she had finally done what she said she wouldn't do, she had fallen in love with a rock star.  No other explanation made sense for everything that was going on between them.  It had become even more apparent to her at Aspen.  He so willingly lent his strength to her to help her achieve things she hadnt done in years.  Her heart hurt a little because she knew the tour would be over soon and things would change.   She closed her eyes and tried to silence the scream that wanted to erupt from her lungs every time she thought about the coming end.  How could she part with him? How could she say goodbye after they had come so far? The logical, realistic side of Lenny told her that this was always temporary, she should have guarded her heart better.  But the romantic, idealistic side of Lenny wanted to hope that Luke would chase her home.  They could get married and have fat babies.  Maybe they could bring the whole family on tour and Lenny could compete in the off season.  That could work, right?  Reasonable Lenny said no.  The tour would end and so would their affair.  They would go home.  Lenny to the mountains where she would begin training again for the Olympics.  And Luke would go home to Boston and record a new album and forget all about her.  That was always the plan, Lenny reminded herself.  This was supposed to be about finding your way into a new life and moving on.  Falling in love was never part of the plan.   The set was over before Lenny realized it and they were almost finished with the encore.  She chewed on the inside of her cheek, contemplating the inevitable.   You okay? Greg interrupted her thoughts.   What? Yeah.  Lenny forced a smile and stood up.   She exited the booth, making her way backstage as the band wrapped up their final song.  Luke was descending the stairs and he saw her immediately.  He scooped her up in a big hug, lifting her off her feet and making her smile.  He brought her back to the earth slowly, being sure to kiss her deeply before letting go.   You wanna get something to eat before going back to the hotel? Luke grabbed Lenny's hand and they started for the green room.   Sure, what do you have in mind? She asked, enjoying the warmth of his hand against hers.   Let's go on an adventure.  Luke raised his eyebrows at her as he held the door open.   I like that idea.  She agreed and then laughed at his excited grin.  No matter how much time they had left, she was going to enjoy every second of it.             The thing with touring overseas is that Luke felt more like he was on vacation than on tour.  They didn't have to sleep on the buses, they had fancy suites in hotels every night.  The travel was all by private plane so they had more time to explore the cities and countryside.  Plus, they still got to play sold out arenas every night.  Each band member had a tendency to go a little wild and really enjoy themselves.   Luke loved Europe.  He'd split off from the guys and do his own thing, the whole time wishing he had someone he could share it with.  Now, he had Lenny, he could share those things with her.   He had taken her to a small pub that he had discovered many years ago on one of their first trips overseas.  They ate some of the local cuisine and talked and laughed until way too late, finally making their way back to the top floor of the hotel.   Stay with me tonight.  He whispered in her ear after he had walked her to her door.  He couldn't stand the thought of her staying in her room all alone.  She was meant to be near him always.  I don't mean in the same bed, just stay in our suite.  He clarified, cupping her cheek in his hand and resting his forehead against hers.   He could see the debate behind her sapphire eyes and he stepped back, letting his hands trail down her arms and rest at her fingertips.  I'll be a perfect gentleman, you can have my room and I'll take the couch.  It would be so much nicer waking up with you there instead of just Sway. . . I need a buffer with that guy sometimes.   She smiled shyly, You make it really hard to follow the rules.   Luke grinned, Then it's a yes? He raised one eyebrow at her.   She sighed in pretend frustration.  Yes.  But I have to get my things and I want take a shower tonight before going to bed.   She retreated to her room and Luke waited in the hallway.  He was. . . giddy.  He wasn't sure if he'd ever been giddy before, it was all very new.  Everything with Lenny was new.  Even after they had returned to his suite and explained to Sway that she'd be staying with them, Sway didn't seem surprised.  It's like she just fit.  Into every part of his life.   When Lenny emerged from the bathroom she was showered, and dressed in shorts with a sponsor's logo and a t-shirt with a faded Double Blind Study band script on it.   Luke eyed the shirt thoughtfully as she took a seat next to him on the couch.   Thats an old shirt, he observed.  Lenny didnt respond so he added.  I thought you said you didnt know who we were.  Referencing back to the day they met.   Lenny blushed, I lied.  Ive always been a fan.   Luke smiled and pulled her into his chest, resting his chin on top of her head.  He didnt care how she had come into his life, just that she was there now.   He could sense something was bothering her, it had been just below the surface all night.  But he decided to wait for her to bring it up.  She was in his arms now, and that meant she was safe.             The sun began to peek through the cloudy skyline of the London backdrop and Lenny sipped her coffee from the couch.  She had woken early, jet lag was confusing, and ordered room service.  Luke woke up when the food came to the door and then headed to the shower right away.  Lenny poured herself a cup of coffee and slipped into a melancholy repose.   One more show in London tonight.  Two more weeks is all they had left.  After last night, the feel of a real date for them, Lenny was falling harder and faster.  It wasnt enough.  It would never be enough.  She would never feel like shed gotten enough kisses.  Or smiles.  Or embraces.  She could and would try to soak up as much of Luke Casey as possible in the next couple of weeks.  But then what?  She blinked back the sudden tears that threatened to overtake her.  She couldnt imagine the days ahead without him.  She sighed with frustration at herself.  She should have never let anyone become such a necessity in her life.  Nothing lasts forever.  And while Luke Casey was her best friend today, in a month she would just be some girl he used to know.  She should end it before the awkward conversation of the logistics came up.  That would be horrible.  It was bad enough that she knew it wasnt going to last, it would be worse to have him have to explain it to her like she was just another. . . groupie.  She didn't think her heart could take that kind of a conversation.   Good coffee, Sway startled Lenny out of her thoughts.  She hadnt even noticed when he had joined her.   Yeah, it's good.  Lenny agreed, having a brief thought about making sure someone brought coffee to Carl.   What were you thinking about? It looked deep.  Sway asked.   Juststuff.  Lenny couldnt come up with anything she really wanted to share.  Too many thoughts, not enough words.   You feeling okay? Sway's eyebrows pushed together in concern.   Yeah.  Lenny forced a smile in his direction but didnt meet his eyes.  Fine, why?  Just asking.  Sway wasn't buying it but he dropped it anyway.   How come you're splitting the suite with Luke instead of it being Mike? Lenny changed the subject.  Sway was never one to be insightful but she didn't need him suspecting her of anything and then telling Luke before she could tell him herself.   Because Europe still turns Mike into a pussy and Harrison and Blake will be better at watching him than Luke.  Sway twisted his face in annoyance.   What do you mean 'better than Luke?' Lenny bristled.   'Cause Luke's busy with you.  Sway picked around the fruit on the food cart and glanced up to see Lenny's offended expression.  Not that it's a bad thing.  We all discussed it, it's the solution we came up with.   Why does Mike have to be babysat? That's a little condescending, don't you think? Lenny said, knowing that that was what Carl had hired her for in the first place but still feeling the need to defend the drummer.   Look, Sway tried again, Mike gets really emotional when we go overseas.  He knows it, we know it.  He has a lot of triggers here.  London is where he met Ilsa.  Sway stopped talking and looked up at Lenny.  She nodded, silently confessing that she knew the private details of their quarrel, guilt washing over her again.  He needs us to watch out for him, it's what brothers do.  Sway settled on a large pastry and came back over to the couch.  He sat down next to Lenny, his face serious and thoughtful.  And Luke needs to be with you right now.   Fresh tears started to form in the back of Lenny's vision and she swallowed hard.  What do you mean? Her voice coming out raspy and thick.   You guys are good for each other.  And no one wants to get in the way of that.  It's that simple.   How is the sexiest girl in the world? Luke interrupted Lenny's stunned thoughts as he came into the room and bent low to kiss her on the lips.   Im okay, kinda gassy.  Sway replied, making Lenny and Luke laugh.  I think it was that salmon I ate last night.  That was salmon, right? He pretended to be embarrassed.  Oh, you meant Lenny.  Never mind.   Im good, how did you sleep? Lenny looked into the most beautiful blue eyes in the world and her heartbeat quickened.  His hair was still wet from his shower and he hadnt put his shirt on yet.  She tried not to stare at the body that she was positive was cut from pure granite by the hand of God.  Now stop that! She scolded herself internally.  You have got to get a handle on yourself.   Fantastic.  Luke replied in a low voice as he leaned in for another kiss.   Hey! Sway jumped in.  Im sitting right here.  He shook his head in mock disgust and got up for another cup of coffee.   Sorry, man.  Luke stared into Lennys eyes.  I just cant get enough of her.   Uh-oh, here comes the jelly legs.  Lenny could feel herself turning into mush, good thing she wasnt standing or walking, or holding something highly valuable.   You guys need to just do it and get it over with.  The sexual tension around here is unbearable.   Lennys eyes widened at Sways words.  Wow, Sway! Inappropriate much? Sway rolled his eyes.   Luke slipped his t-shirt over his head and pulled Lenny to her feet.  He planted another perfect kiss on her lips.  He moved his arms around her waist and started kissing her neck.   Go get dressed, I want to take you around London today before the show.  He murmured in her ear.   Lenny hoped she could walk, she wasnt so confident in her knees ability to not buckle.  She flashed him a smile and then hurried to change her clothes.  Two weeks left, she wasn't going to waste it.             As Lenny closed the door to the bedroom to get dressed Luke helped himself to the fruit on the table.   Lenny was right, that was inappropriate, Luke rebuked Sway quietly.   Cmon, you guys are constantly macking on each other and talking all cute and stuff.  Just do it and get it over with.  I dont know what youre waiting for.  Sway grabbed an apple off the platter and examined it.  I mean, I know Lennys special and blah, blah, blah but its beena while now.  Youve never waited with any other girl before.  He took a bite.  I dont get it.   Its not about that.  Luke said, his mouth curving up slightly on the side.  I love her.  Ill wait as long as it takes.   Whats that supposed to mean? Sway tried to ask around his mouthful, losing chunks of apple in the process.   Shes the only one I want to be with ever again.  I never want to be without her.   Youre talking code, dude.  Youre gonna have to explain to me.  Sway's eyes went wide in exasperation.   I dont want to have sex just because it seems like its time.  Ive done that, it doesnt mean anything.  Not this time.  Shes the only one I ever want to be with in that way, for the rest of my life.  Luke poured the hot coffee into an empty cup on the tray.   Sway choked on his apple as he finally understood what Luke was saying.  He gasped for air as he tried to ask a question but couldnt get around the chunk of apple lodged in his throat.   Luke laughed at him and looked out the window at the London landscape.  Yep.  He confirmed Sways fears.  Im gonna marry her.  He smiled to himself and brought the coffee cup to his lips, I just have to figure out when and how to ask her.        16    A Drop In The Ocean      It was as it had always been for Duke.  Growing up the youngest of five kids, his siblings had left home long before he was born.  He had been his parents surprise baby.  Raised like an only child on the backside of the Ozarks, Duke had few friends and kept to himself.  He enjoyed people and he wasnt shy by any means.  He just didnt need people.  And thats where he found himself again.  Alone.  His third long drive in as many days.   He passed by the local tavern a couple of times and considered pulling into the parking lot.  Maybe just feel the warmth of the neon for a few minutes, it didnt mean hed have to go inside.  Hed shake off the feeling and continue driving.   The drive was always the same.  Long.  Lonely.  Unchanging.  He never saw anything he hadnt seen a thousand times before.  He passed all the same little cabins and no trespassing signs that had always been there.  Now, it was starting to snow.  Not regular snow.  Big, thick, lazy snow.  The kind that would pile into slush on the ground, quickly making driving conditions more treacherous.  Duke turned the wipers on and peered into the gray.   Up ahead he could almost make out a car pulled over on the side of the road.  Its hazards were on but the falling snow was so think it was almost unnoticeable.  Duke pulled in behind the small compact car, this was no place to have car trouble.  It was a blind turn and with the weather, it was a tragedy waiting to happen.   The plates on the little Ford said California.  Figures, out of towners always think they can drive in the snow, Duke thought to himself.  He set his brake and turned his own hazards on and got out of the old Bronco.   As he approached the drivers side of the car he saw a woman talking on her cellphone.  He tapped on the window, startling her.  The windows were foggy and starting to frost on the corners from the cold.  The woman held up her finger for Duke to wait and she slowly stepped out of the car.   She was tall, Duke observed, for a woman.  She was probably close to six feet because she was nearly eye level with him.  She had raven black hair that easily reached her waist but was twisted into a loose braid that came over one shoulder.  Her almond shaped eyes were a beautiful chestnut brown.  She was stunning, to say the least.  But her physical appearance isnt what caught Dukes eye first.  It was the . 45 pointed at his chest.   Duke raised his hands slightly.  He wasnt sure if she was being overly cautious or if she was going to rob him.   Im waiting for a tow truck, you would do best to get back into your vehicle and be on your way.  She spoke with authority and held the weapon like an experienced professional.  Duke didnt want to argue.  But it was in his nature.   Nice Sig, He complimented her.  He kept his hands raised.  I just thought I might be able to help.  He looked back up the road.  Its a blind turn, someone might not see you.   Ill be just fine.  She spoke assuredly but Duke saw her swallow just a little too hard.   Im in no mood to cause you any trouble, maam.  Duke thought hed try one more time.  He had a soft spot for stubborn women with guns. . . apparently.  Did you call the Highway Patrol?  He could see her mind working quickly behind those dark eyes.  She nodded but didnt answer.   You can call and confirm with them who I am.  I live just a mile up the road, I help them pull cars out of ditches all the time.  Id be glad to help you now, 'cause who knows when the tow truck will make it up here in this snow.   Do you have ID? The woman asked, raising an eyebrow.   Duke fished his license out of his back pocket and handed it to her.  She gave him a hard look and then got back in her car and on the phone.  She spoke for a few minutes to what Duke assumed was the local dispatch.  She gave him a sideways glance out the window and nodded to whoever was on the phone.  When she stepped back out of the car she had holstered her weapon somewhere Duke couldnt be sure but at least it wasnt pointed directly at him.   How far can you tow me? She asked, handing back his ID.   As far as you need, Duke replied.   Ill need to get the car repaired in town, is there a mechanics shop?  Yeah, Duke was headed to the Bronco to get his tow cables.  You staying in town or do you need a lift back up here?  Ill rent something and drive back up, thank you.  She was definitely not a friendly lady, Duke thought.  But his thoughts changed quickly when he saw her getting a bundle of blankets out of the backseat of her car.   It was a child, maybe four years old, all tucked and rolled inside numerous blankets and afghans.   Can we wait in your truck? She asked, her lips making a hard line on her face.  No wonder she had been so quick to suspicion.  She had precious cargo.   Absolutely.  Duke dropped his tow cables and helped her and the child into the warmth of the still running Bronco.  He made sure they were buckled safely inside and then he maneuvered the Bronco to the front of her tiny car.  Duke jumped out and quickly connected the tow cables, rigging everything securely.   When he got back into the truck he tried to give her a reassuring smile.   Were all set.  He put the Bronco in gear and started slowly back down the mountain, paying extra close attention to his driving.  Hed never transported kids before.  He wasnt sure what would be an acceptable rate of speed.  She still had that . 45 somewhere and he really didnt need her pointing it at him while he drove.   Are we going sledding, Mom? A little voice from the middle seat asked sweetly.   Moms car broke so well have to go sledding tomorrow.  The woman explained gently.  Her tone was so different with her child that Duke had to look over to see if it was the same woman.  Her face had softened as she looked at her son and Duke was caught off guard by her sweet smile.   She looked up at him and they had eye contact briefly before Duke turned his gaze back to the road.  What the hell was that? He reprimanded himself.  Keep your eyes on the road, Duke.  She has a gun.   Who are you? The child asked Duke bluntly.  He couldnt help but smile at the forthright question.   His name is Mr.  Dukane and hes giving us a ride to the place where we can get our car fixed.  She explained to the boy.   Duke had never been called Mr.  Dukane before.  Hed been Duke for as long as he could remember.  She had gotten that off his ID.   Actually, you can call me Duke.  Its what everyone else calls me.  He said with a grin to the boy.  His eye caught hers again and he decided to wink.  She's going to shoot me.   Whats your name? Duke asked the boy, deciding not to steal anymore glances at the exotic beauty to his right.   Im Tyler and Im four.  Tyler said proudly.   Pleased to meet you, Tyler.  Duke said and then asked, Whats your moms name?  Mom.  Tyler responded making Duke chuckle.   My name is Natalie.  She replied with her own soft laugh.   Yeah, Natalie.  Tyler confirmed.  Is this your truck? He inquired next.   Yep, it sure is.  Duke confirmed.  He was liking how easy it was to talk to Tyler, way easier than talking to Tylers mom.   It sure is big.  Tyler said trying to peer over the dash.  Then, Do you go sledding, Duke?  Sometimes, Duke said with a small laugh.  But I stand up on my sled.   Thats not allowed.  Tyler reported, You could get hurt.   Thats true.  Duke agreed, Sometimes I do get hurt.   The conversation continued on like this for another thirty minutes as Duke carefully drove through the ever increasing storm.  Tyler, obviously tired, snuggled up against his mother and the cab fell quiet again.   Thank you.  Natalie said, breaking the silence.   Not a problem.  Duke responded, Im just glad you didnt shoot me up there.  He grinned at her impulsively.   She smiled a little.  It was a lovely smile.   I couldnt take any chances.  Natalie explained as she stroked her sons hair.  Hes all I have.   Duke wondered what she meant.  He didnt want to cross the boundaries of the social norm but hed never been good at following those rules anyway.   Wheres Tylers father? Duke blurted.  It sounded awful as it spilled out of him but he couldnt take it back now.  Maybe she would just shoot him after all.   He died in Afghanistan three years ago.  She answered with a touch of regret in her voice.   Army? Duke asked.   Marine, Natalie corrected.  That explained the Sig.   Im sorry, was all Duke could think of to say.   He was a good dad.  Natalie continued, Tyler wont ever remember him, but Ive never seen a man love his child the way Mark loved Tyler.   So, its just you two against the world then.  Duke said it as a statement more than a question.   We do okay on our own.  Natalie quietly defended.   I have no doubt.  Duke agreed.  Ive never had a gun pulled on me for offering to help with a tow.  He gave her a sideways grin.   Sorry about that.  She attempted to apologize but Duke stopped her.   Dont you dare.  He said sternly.  More women should do exactly what you did.   She turned her head to hide her smile but Duke saw it reflect on the window.   So, you live around here? She changed the subject and Duke let her.   Yeah, I live in this ugly lodge up in the mountains.   She chuckled at his description and he felt warmth creep into his cheeks.  He liked making her laugh.   So Duke didnt want to come across as a creeper but he wanted to know if he should be aware of any other men in her life before he proceeded with his train of thought.  Do you have a boyfriend or fianc or anything?  Ha! Natalie laughed again.  That was real subtle.  She was smiling openly now.   Im not good with women.  Duke muttered, embarrassed at his actions.  He knew he had just blown it.   No.  Natalie snickered.  The answer to your question is no, there is no one like that in my life.  She looked down at her sleeping child.  I dont have time for any of that.  Most guys arent looking for a package deal anyhow.   Duke considered her words, not totally sure what she meant.  Guys didnt like her because she came with a kid? That was shallow.  And stupid.   Why are you in Wyoming? He decided to ask instead.   We needed to get away and Tyler had never seen snow before.  My dad owns a cabin in the mountains.  I havent been up here since I was a little girl, I dont even know if the cabin is livable.  She confessed at the end.   Well, if you were looking for snow, you came to the right place.  Duke said, pulling into the parking lot of the best mechanic in town.  Whos your dad? He asked thoughtfully, he knew pretty much everyone in the area.   Colonel Henry Clay.   Duke whistled under his breath.  I know that cabin.  Thats a sweet piece of property.  Has he had anyone taking care of it?  Im not sure, Natalie responded.  Dad passed away last year and left the cabin to me.  I thought now would be a good time to check it out.  She rolled her eyes at herself.  Smart, in the middle of winter.   Duke had parked the Bronco and now he leaned back in his seat and rubbed his short beard thoughtfully.   Well, its still early enough in the day.  Let me go in and get Earl started on your car and then Ill drive you up there and take a look over it myself.  He saw her hesitate and quickly added.  If you dont mind, that is.  Im a pretty good handy-man.   He saw her mind working swiftly.  She was as smart as she was beautiful.  If she thought he was still a threat she would turn him down, but Duke didn't see it going that way.  Besides, if he tried anything, she could just shoot him.   Thanks, Shawn.  She smiled, the warmth of it making Duke blush under his beard again, Id really appreciate that.   Duke grinned and jumped out of the truck.  He jogged into Earls, unable to hide his delight.  No one had called him by his first name in a long time.  He liked the way it sounded.  It made his heart beat just a tad bit differently.             The rest of the European tour was a blur for Lenny, it went entirely too fast.  In every city, Luke had something he wanted to share with her.  He was excited and energetic, showing her all the little shops and non-touristy attractions that were his favorite.  She giggled at his antics and thrill for the adventure.   They hardly spent any time with the other band members anymore, they were nearly always alone.  Lenny couldnt tell if it bothered the guys, they hadnt said anything.  She only half-cared.  The days were flying by and she wasnt going to miss a single second with Luke.   Her attitude became one of passionate desperation.  She absorbed every word, every smile, and every kiss.  She tried to memorize the lines in his hands and how the calluses on his fingertips felt against her cheek when he would touch her face.   And before Lenny could be satisfied, the tour was done.  They were on a plane bound Stateside, decompressing and relaxing.  They talked of the successful shows, the fantastic reviews, the sold out performances.  Carl was more at ease than Lenny had ever seen him.  He pulled his ball cap down low over his eyes and fell fast asleep.   Ever diligent, Luke was already discussing the next album.  Where should they record? Who should they go with for a producer? What kind of vibe should they try to capture? It was all very interesting and Lenny tried to keep up with as much of the lingo as she could.  She had a pressing in her heart that she was trying to ignore.  Luke still hadnt talked about them and she was afraid it was because he didnt know how.   She could broach the subject.  After all, it was on her mind.  What if he changed? What if he shut down and pulled away and got cold? Lenny didnt think she could bear it if Luke started to treat her differently.  She felt foolish for feeling that way.  Shed never been in love before, she had no idea what to do with it.  Especially in circumstances like this, where her reality and her ideal were complete opposites.   She thought about telling Luke that she loved him.  He hadnt said it since his outburst at Ashton.  That was okay because Lenny didnt really want to have to say I love you, too.  She just wanted to say it.  Without requirement or expectation.  So he would know there were no stipulations.  She simply loved him.  But the timing always seemed off, and she didnt want it to come out forced or trite.   Of course, the next fear was that he didnt feel the same.  Based on the things he said, how he acted and treated her, Lenny knew in her heart he loved her.  Shed known since the first moment they kissed.  But rock stars fall in love all the time, she reminded herself.  Thats how they make such great music.             Sway saw the small interaction between Lenny and Luke.  It was subtle but perfect.  The guys were thrilled with Lennys presence in their lives.  They didnt care that Luke had taken to spending every waking moment with her.  She was good to him and he deserved that.   When Luke had told Sway he was planning on marrying the girl, Sway had been stunned at first.  But as he considered their relationship, it fit.  Sway had never been in love.  Sure, hed made a lot of what looked like love.  But hed never felt for one person the way Luke obviously felt for Lenny.  And they hadnt even slept together.  It blew Sways mind.  And yet, as he watched them together, it made perfect sense.             Harrison and Blake were arguing not so quietly about what they think shouldve happened on their favorite daytime soap opera.  It kind of distracted Lenny from her fear of flying closer to good-bye.  She quietly laughed at their antics and felt a lump rise in her throat.  She would miss them.  All of them.  Not just Luke.  She would miss Blake and Harrison's petty arguments and ridiculous capers.  She would miss Sway asking her to help him with his flyaways and split ends.  She would miss Mikes dry humor and his ability to anticipate the next step.  She would miss Carls crankiness and ranch foreman mentality.   She leaned her head against the back of the seat.  She was going to have serious withdrawal after she left these guys.  She wondered who would take her place for the next tour.  Would they treat them as good she would? Would they follow Carls guidelines and put the band first? Would they fall in love with the lead singer?  Lenny couldnt handle anymore thoughts.  She squeezed Lukes hand instinctively and closed her eyes.  Maybe she would feel better about her plan after she had gotten some sleep.             Luke felt the gentle pressure on his hand and frowned slightly at Lennys resting posture.  Her eyes were closed but her face wasnt relaxed.  She appeared to be thinking hard, trying to will sleep to happen.  He wondered what was bothering her.  Well, it had been a long trip, Luke decided.  She was probably just tired.             The plane landed in New York and they had a two hour layover before their next flight to Boston.  The guys napped in the waiting area, jet lag was a bitch.  Lenny was kind of surprised that there was a ticket for her to Boston as well and not somewhere further west.  She assumed it was Carl and decided that Boston would be as good as any place to say goodbye.   The flight was fast, only an hour, from LaGuardia to Boston.  Lenny barely had time to collect her thoughts.  As they were disembarking, she knew what she had to do.  She tapped into that special feature in her brain that she reserved for competitions.  She shut everything out and took a deep breath.  The wall came up, separating her from her surroundings.  She had a mission, and it was time to execute.   They were at baggage claim and Lenny waited for the guys to gather in a huddle around her.  No one noticed that her bags hadnt arrived.  They naturally gravitated toward her and she waited till she had their attention.   Im going home.  She said plainly, her tone gentle.  She didnt want to hurt them but someone needed to rip the Band-Aid off.  Shed already gotten a connecting flight that would have several stops before she reached home.  All she had to do was catch her next flight.   What do you mean? I thought you were going to Lukes house.  Harrisons eyes were already starting to water.  Lenny loved his tender heart, he didnt like change.   I was not aware of that plan.  Lenny looked to Luke but his eyes had lost focus.  The reality had hit him.   This is where you guys live, I dont.  My job is ended.  She got a confirmation nod from Carl and continued.  But I have had the best time of my life with all of you.  She looked at Luke again.  He was staring at her with the saddest eyes shed ever seen.   I have a whole other life that needs tending to out west.  She paused, her mental barrier starting to strain against the heavy emotion that was threatening to overpower her.  I will miss all of you, more than you know.   The guys hugged her one by one, their heads low.  They backed off a little to give Luke and Lenny some space.   Lennys resolve was weakening as she looked into Lukes eyes that were starting to turn red from held back tears.   I will miss you the most.  She offered a small smile.  She grabbed both of his hands in hers and whispered, I have never, in my life, felt for anyone what I feel for you.   Then why are you going? Lukes voice was hoarse with emotion.   Because its time, Lenny whispered.  I cant hang around like a fangirl the rest of my life.  I have to grow up one of these days.  She tried to get him to smile but he wouldnt.   Luke suddenly took her in his arms and held her tight.  He whispered in her ear, I dont want you to go.   This was Lennys moment.  She gave him a long embrace and then pulled back, kissed him tenderly on his lips and looked him in the eye.  She wanted to make sure he knew she was for real.   I love you, Luke Casey.  I will always love you.  She stepped back and took a shuddering breath.  Now, go.  She smiled as sincerely as her heart would let her.  Be amazing.  She allowed herself to behold his masculine perfection one last time, trying to memorize every single striking detail, and then she turned around.   He didn't call out to her or chase her.  He was letting her go.  A tear escaped and splashed onto her cheek.  Her legs carried her onward and her heart quaked in her chest.  She would feel better in a few days.  This was how it had to be.  He couldnt face reality, so she had to do it for the both of them.  The longer they tried to make it work, the harder it would be to end it.  They would each resent each other, making it an ugly end.  And Lenny didnt want that.  She wanted to remember her time with Luke as the greatest adventure of her life.  Because it truly was.        17    Drive All Night      Lenny rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and looked around.  She had to reorient herself.  Where was she? Oh yes, she thought, layover hell.  She had flown from Boston to Atlanta and what was supposed to be a ninety minute layover turned into three hours.  Then she flew from Atlanta to Salt Lake City where a blizzard greeted her and the other passengers.  She had been waiting in the terminal for six hours until they were cleared for flight to Jackson Hole.   She sat up in the chair and tried to straighten the kinks in her back.  She grimaced as it popped and pulled.  Its tough getting older, she thought wryly.  Being an adult sucks, she had concluded during her first layover of the trip.  Leaving Luke was the most painful thing she had experienced and she still wasnt in a place where she could properly grieve.  Surrounded by strangers and airport personnel, she couldnt very well break down into choking heaving sobs, she would cause a panic.  She would have to wait till she got home.   Home.  It was still so far away.  She hadnt told anyone she was coming home so no would be expecting her.  She figured shed rent a car, drive to the Lodge and crash for a few days until her clock readjusted.  Maybe she would just stay in bed for the rest of her life.  Yes, that was the new plan.   At long last, the call came over the intercom to board her final flight.  She shuffled through the line with the other passengers, feeling more raggedy than she had her whole life.  Just an hour more.  She focused on the next step.   As she settled into her seat, the flight attendants reminded them to please turn off their cellphones during takeoff.  Lenny glanced at hers painfully.  She had left it on, hoping Luke would call.  But he hadnt.  No one had.  Not Harrison or Sway or Mike.  No one had called or texted to even check on her.  The heaviness in Lennys chest increased substantially as the plane started its taxi down the runway.             When they left the airport in Boston it got ugly.  Harrison openly wept and Blake was so pissed he threw his luggage at a sign and they had to be escorted from the building.  The guys had yelled at Luke.  They demanded to know why he had let Lenny walk away.  Why didnt he chase her? What was stopping him? Wasnt he supposed to be in love? They were beyond disappointed in their fearless leader.  He had no answers for them.  Instead he set his jaw and got in a cab and took off.   Sway got incredibly emotional and called a girlfriend to come pick him up.  Carl shrugged, muttered something about rock stars and got his own cab.   Mike was angry.  But he was handling it better than Blake, whose face was now a lovely shade of purple.  He rubbed his temples in the back of the taxi that he was sharing with Blake and Harrison.   Harrison, please stop crying, Mike grit his teeth together.   Im sorry, Harrison sniffed pitifully.   Its alright, man.  Just try to calm down.  Mike tried to be understanding.  But he didnt understand.  What was that bullshit Luke had said about wanting to marry her?  Im gonna kick his ass! Blake declared.  I dont care if he is Luke freaking Casey.  Im gonna knock him out.   Get in line, Mike muttered.   What the hell are we supposed to do now? Blake asked pointedly.  I thought Lenny was a permanent member of this band.  Sonofabitch!  So did I, Mike said.   The cab brought them to their building where they all had their own separate loft in the same massive structure.  Luke had bought a large colonial style house in the countryside.  Sways living quarters were a small apartment near the TD Garden where he lived in complete anonymity.  But Blake, Harrison and Mike had lived in the same building for years.   The elevator slowly rose to their floor, Harrison leaning heavily against the steel doors.   Lets go get her.  He muttered, his breath making a fog on the metal.   Blake and Mike exchanged glances but didn't respond.   We can go to Wyoming and get her.  Tell her it was a misunderstanding.  Shell believe us.  Well bring her back and Luke will be so happy he His voice trailed off.   Hell what? Propose? Mike reacted with more bark than he intended.  Right.  She tells him she loves him in the airport but thats not enough to ask her to stay.  But we forcibly bring her back and suddenly he sees the light?  The door to the elevator opened on Blakes floor and they all got out.   Harrison hung his head and shuffled along in front of them, stopping at Blake's entry.  We have to do something.  He said quietly.   Yeah, get over her, Mike said sardonically.   Blake wrestled with his key before opening the door and going straight for the refrigerator.   God bless you, Claudia, he said out loud, pulling a huge chocolate cheesecake out of the fridge and setting it on the counter.  Claudia was his housekeeper and she faithfully left a massive dessert in the refrigerator for Blake on the day he returned from a long tour.   You guys want to drown your feelings in some serious calories? Blake produced forks and tossed them down.   Why not? Mike answered.  It was better than going down to the corner and buying a bindle, which he had thought about for maybe a millisecond.   Harrison took a bite of the cake and started crying again.  We have to get her back, he lamented.   How? Blake asked contemptuously, If Luke doesnt want her around what can we do?  We can fire Luke and put Lenny in his place.  Harrisons eyes lit up at the prospect and it made Mike chuckle.   That might work actually.  Blake assented with an emphatic nod.  Im so pissed at him, I dont want see him for a very long time.   Me either.  Harrison shook his head in disgust.  He pulled out his phone, Im calling her.   Nah, man.  Her phone is probably off.  Just wait a couple days, let her get home first.  Mike said reasonably.   Okay.  Harrison begrudgingly put his phone down.             Luke had been driving for a while, he wasnt sure how long.  He had gotten home and unloaded his luggage inside his big empty house.  The house he had been planning on bringing Lenny to.  Then he got his old pick-up out of the garage and started to drive.  He didnt really have a plan; he just didnt want to be in his house.  Not without her.   He stopped at a tiny gas station to fill up.  It was cold and he pulled his leather jacket tighter around his neck as he waited for the pump to stop.  He looked around at his surroundings and decided to buy a map.   He spread the map out on the seat next to him and gave it a good look.  Pennsylvania.  Why did Wyoming have to be so frickin' far away?  He started the truck and pulled back out onto the road.  Maybe the drive would give him time to think about what he would say to her when he got there.   The guys were pissed at him.  He knew they blamed him for Lenny leaving.  Shouldnt they, though? He didnt want her to leave, that was the last thing he had been expecting.  He'd been completely blindsided.  But as she broke down the details, the obvious dawned on him.  They lived in separate worlds.  Goodbye had been inevitable.   No, that wasnt right either.  She had left because he hadnt explained his plan to her.  He had left her out of it.  Of course, she had been making plans, too, it seemed and had left him out of it.  Why hadnt they been talking to each other about this? Because they were enjoying the moment.  Moments.  All of them.   Sure, he couldve dropped to his knees in baggage claim and proposed right there.  But wouldnt that have seemed forced? Especially since he didnt have a ring yet? And what if she had said no? That thought scared him the most.  She said she loved him but then she left.  She justwalked away.   He regretted everything that had happened so far that day.  He needed to get away and think.  He had to fix this somehow.  He had to get to her.  Show her that he loved her, not just say it.             Lenny didnt know how long shed been sleeping but it still didnt feel like enough.  She pulled the covers tighter over her head and cursed the daylight filling her bedroom.   She had taken a cab all the way to the Lodge when she had landed in Jackson Hole.  It was not a cheap ride but she hadnt called anyone she knew because she didnt want to talk to them.  Anyone.   She had heard Duke coming and going downstairs but he had never come up to check on her.  He had to know she was home, shed left her luggage strewn at the bottom of the stairs.  It only added to her self-inflicted misery.  No one cared about her.   She checked her phone again.  Still nothing.   Lenny angrily pushed the covers off of her and glared at her giant windows letting in all the horrible light.  Out of the corner of her eye she saw her luggage stacked neatly in the corner.  Obviously Duke had brought them up.  That meant he had checked on her after all.  Lenny felt worse for thinking harsh thoughts about him.   She got out of bed and dragged herself to the bathroom.  She stared at her face in the mirror with loathing.  She looked terrible.  Black mascara smudges all the way to her chin, her eyes were red and puffy from hours of crying into her pillow.  Her hair was matted and greasy, she hadnt showered in days.  She was wearing an old ratty pair of shorts and Lukes t-shirt that she had kept after he said she could.   So, this is my life.  She thought as she examined her atrocious appearance.  No wonder Luke doesnt want me.  I look like death.  She heard her stomach rumble and frowned.  She hadnt eaten in a while, maybe there were some cookies or something stashed in the kitchen.   She took the stairs slowly, trying to listen if Duke was home or not.  She didnt want to see or talk to anyone right now.  She crept into the kitchen and started rummaging through cupboards, finally finding an unopened package of Oreos.  She poured herself a glass of milk and shoved a few cookies in her mouth as she headed for the stairs to go back to bed.   Hey, she lives! Duke said from behind her.  Lenny froze in her tracks.  She thought about continuing on upwards without saying anything.  But she slowly turned around, swallowing her mouthful of cookies.   She was confused at first by Dukes clean shaven face, it took her a moment to adjust.  She'd never seen him without a beard and she almost didn't recognize him.   You look awful.  Duke stated with a serious frown.   Thanks, Lenny said forlornly, shoving another cookie in her mouth and wiping some milk dribble off her cheek.   I mean, you look like you need a shower.  Duke tried again, frown not flinching.   Youre not helping, Lenny glowered.  What happened to your face?  Duke reached up and stroked where his beard used to be.  I thought it might be time for a change.  It was making me look older.   Whatever.  Lenny said with no conviction.   Sorry.  Duke took a step towards her, discomfort all over his face.  You wanna talk about it?  No.  Lenny said and turned to go back to her room.  The world is a horrible place and Im going to die alone in my room.   She heard Duke stifle a laugh at her response.  Maybe you should have something better to eat than cookies.   No, Lenny said belligerently.   Lenny Duke began nervously, Ithereare some people Id like you to meet.   Lenny paused and turned on the third step, staring at Duke dumbly.   Theyre gonna be here soon- He tried to speak calmly, looking at her not-ready-for-guests appearance.   How soon? Lenny asked.   As if on cue, the front doorbell rang and Lennys eyes widened at him.  No, Duke.  Whoever it is, tell them Im sick or dead or something.   But there was no time, a young boy came racing into the kitchen and grabbed Duke around his middle.   Hey! Duke greeted the boy and hugged him back briefly.  Lenny watched with the eyes of a woman who thought she might be losing her mind.  Before she could process the childs presence, a tall, black haired beauty entered the room with an apologetic smile.   Sorry, Tyler figured out the door was unlocked.   Thats okay.  Duke answered her with a smile.  What was that in his eyes? Adoration? He was beaming at this stranger in Lennys kitchen as if he had known her for years.  And she was looking at him the same way.   What is going on? Is the boy Dukes? How long have I been asleep? Am I even here anymore or did I finally die and Im a ghost watching my friends and family move on with their lives?  Hi, you must be Lenny.  Duke has told me so much about you.  The raven haired woman reached her hand out.   So they can see me, that rules out ghost.  Lenny stepped down into the kitchen, adjusted her milk and cookies into one arm and shook the tall womans hand.  She knew she was gaping but she really couldnt stop.  She had high cheek bones and the straightest, shiniest, blackest hair Lenny had ever seen.  Her scent filled the kitchen, Lenny couldnt place the fragrance but it was warm and intoxicating.  Not overpowering, but comforting, like a blanket that Lenny wanted to wrap up in and sleep forever.   Lenny, this Natalie Rodgers.  Her father was Colonel Henry Clay, she and her son, Tyler, are moving up to the Clay cabin.  Duke introduced proudly.   Oh, was all Lenny could get out.   Duke shifted uncomfortably as he waited for Lenny to say more.  He grimaced again at her appearance and she knew this was not her best look.   Im sorry for my Lenny looked down at herself, Hideousness, she finished.   Natalie gave her a smile as warm as sunshine.  Dont apologize, Ive been there.  She was so gracious that it caused Lenny to want to fling herself into the womans arms and start sobbing all over again.   Are you the girl that can fly? Tyler inquired with wondering eyes.   Lenny turned her gaze on the young boy and felt tears start to form in the back of her eyes.  I used to be, she choked out.   Duke grabbed Tyler around the shoulders and turned him around.  Lets go see if we can find a snowboard your size, what do ya say?  Okay! Tyler agreed amicably with the distraction.   Duke glanced over his shoulder, Nat, can you try to get her to shower or. . . something? He motioned his head in Lennys direction and Natalie nodded at him.   As the guys disappeared into the other room, Lenny continued staring at the gorgeous woman in her kitchen.  She studied her openly and shoved another cookie in her mouth.  Maybe she was some sort of angel.  Or mystical princess.   How about we get some real food in you.  Natalie said and took away the package of cookies.  She removed her coat, hat and gloves, setting them aside.  Then she went to the fridge and effortlessly whipped up eggs, sausage and toast presenting it to Lenny who had managed to shuffle to the counter and sit on a stool.  She was still staring.   Where did you come from? Lenny finally asked as she apathetically shoveled food into her mouth.   My car broke down and Shawn towed us into town.   Shawn? You call him Shawn? Lenny was incredulous.  And weirdly jealous.  Duke was hers, she'd never had to share him with anyone before.   Well, thats his name, Natalie smiled.   Hes always been Duke to me, I guess.  Lenny mumbled.  Shawn? That was new.  This whole thing was new.  So, was this woman Dukes girlfriend? She had a different last name than her dad, she was probably married.  Was she going to get Duke killed?  Are you married? Lenny asked bluntly.   Widowed.  My husband was a Marine.  He died in combat three years ago.  Natalie poured Lenny a glass of orange juice.   Lenny swallowed hard.  Now she felt like a vile wretch.  Sorry.   Its all right.  Natalie leaned across the counter on her elbows and looked Lenny in the eye.  Bad break up? She asked with such compassion that Lenny started to cry again.   Natalie came around the counter and gently hugged Lenny to her side.  Lenny sank against her.  She didnt know this woman but she suddenly needed her.   Natalie pulled Lenny up and towards the stairs.  As they made their way to the top floor, Lenny spilled her heart out.   I told him I loved him! I mean, how stupid is that? I just said, hey, I love you, goodbye. He hasnt even called!I know, I know, Im the one who left but I thought they would call.  I thought someone would call.  Even Shane called! I thought I was important.  I guess Im not.  Im just aloser! Lenny collapsed on her bed, face down.  She twisted her face out of the pillow and continued, And I know it would have never worked.  I mean, how could it? He has this whole other incredible life.  Of course he didnt want me hanging around forever.  I was aflingan experimentconvenient.  Her breath caught on the last word.  Just like Ashton.  Fresh tears pooled in her eyes.   Natalie moved to the bathroom and started a hot shower.  She came back and helped Lenny into a standing position.   Youre not a loser, Natalie spoke firmly.  But you really need to get cleaned up.  Just because he hasnt called doesnt mean you can forgo basic hygiene.   Lenny nodded begrudgingly and began the arduous task of getting showered.  She toweled off and Natalie coached Lenny into getting dressed in fresh clothes.  Then Natalie sat Lenny down on the bench at the end of her bed and took careful time to comb out Lennys long tangled hair.   Why are you being so nice to me? Lenny whispered.   Youre important to Shawn.  Natalie said simply.  And Shawn is important to me.  Besides, Ive been through my fair share of break ups, it helps to have a friend.   How long have you guys known each other? Lenny was touched at this womans kindness and compassion.   Oh, about two weeks.  Natalie laughed lightly.  I know that seems fast but when youve been through as much as I have, you know what to look for in a person.   I used to think I knew what to look for.  Lenny said, more tears threatening to spill over.  What was wrong with her? Shed never acted this emotional before in her whole life.  She was stronger than this.  She had to be.  She'd forgotten or something.   Just because he let you walk away doesnt mean he didnt have feelings for you.  Natalie came around to look Lenny in the eyes.  Sometimes, guys get scared and they act badly.   He hasnt even called.  Lenny whispered, folding her hands helplessly in her lap.   I know, and he might not.  Natalie said honestly.  Its important to grieve.  Youre not doing anything wrong.   But Im acting like a crazy person, Lenny protested.  This isnt me! Im always focused and in control and level headedNow Imjust a mess.   Natalie touched Lennys chin gently and offered a small smile.   Its okay to be messy.  Love does that to us.   When will I feel better? Lenny asked.   Itll take some time.  Natalie admitted.  But from what Shawn has told me about you, youre strong and courageous.  Youll get through this.   Ive never been in love before.  Lenny mumbled, looking at the floor.  It hurts so bad.  Like a piece of me is missing.  Not something small like a fingermore like a lung.   Natalie patted her knee.  Yep.  I know what that feels like.  She swallowed hard.  But it will get better.  I promise.   Lenny looked into Natalies dark eyes and wanted so badly to believe her.  She had to hope it would get better.  She just wished she didnt have to miss Luke so badly while she was waiting for it to get better.  Was that too much to ask?            Duke brought Tyler back inside to warm up and found the ladies in the living room sitting by the fire.  It brought a special peace over him that he couldnt explain.   Theres hot chocolate on the stove, Natalie directed him.   Duke filled a cup for both he and Tyler and then they joined them in the other room.  Tyler lay down on the floor and took off his socks, propping up his feet to face the fire.  Duke sat in the chair adjacent to the couch.   Im glad you got cleaned up, he lifted his chin to Lenny, taking in her fresh face and clothes.  She was wearing a fuzzy gray sweater that he hadnt seen her in since their trip to Alaska a few years back.  She had bought it in a little shop of handmade items.  It reminded him of a phone call hed gotten a couple days prior.   Yeah, I guess I just didnt know what to do with myselfI still kinda dont.  Lenny was blue.   Duke frowned.  He had really believed that Luke was the one.  It had all seemed so clear but hed just let her walk away.  What a fool, Duke decided internally.   Hey, Nick called the other day.  Duke changed the subject.   Nick? Lenny frowned quizzically, Nick Federa?  Duke nodded, Yup.  He and Serge and a few of the guys are heading to Alaska this week.  He heard you were back in the game and wanted to know if youd be up for it.  His offer hung in the air.  The perfect escape.  A two week trip to the back country of Alaska with some of the best riders in the world.  No television, no distractions.  Nothing but the purity and thrill of riding ancient mountains.   Are you going? Lenny questioned, a small spark stirring in her blue eyes.   Duke sighed and glanced at Natalie.  Nah, Im gonna stick around here.  Ive been helping Natalie get her cabin in order and I cant very well bail on her now.   Youve done enough already, Natalies eyebrows went up.  I can get the rest finished.  I wouldnt mind if you wanted to go on a trip with your friends.   Dukes eyes crinkled at the sides as he smiled at her.  I know you wouldnt mind.  I think Id miss you guys too much.  He stared adoringly at Natalie, forgetting for a moment that Lenny was sitting right there until she cleared her throat in an obvious manner.   Anyways, I told Federa I wasnt going but you might be up for it.  Duke directed back to Lenny.  He knew she didn't have any plans, her future was wide open if she wanted it.  All she had set out to do was die in her room under a pile of blankets and cookie crumbs.   Yeah, Ill go.  She sat up straight.  When do I have to get out of here?  Duke was a little shocked by her abrupt agreement.  Maybe he shouldnt have been.  She did have a history of running away when things got tough.  Was this another example of that? No, she told Luke goodbye, she didnt just disappear.  He knew where she was going and he hadnt called or tried to get a hold of her at all.  Going to Alaska on a whim is exactly what the old Lenny would have done.   Youd have to fly out tonight.  Duke challenged her.   Dang, I dont even have time to pack.  Lenny showed a small lopsided smile that gave Duke hope.  She wasnt gone, she was just hurt.   You dont have to impress those idiots, you know.  Duke lightly scolded.   I know.  Lenny stood up, Im gonna call the airline and see if I can even get a ticket.   After Lenny had left the room, Duke moved over to sit next to Natalie on the couch.   You really think its a good idea for her to do this? He asked her softly.  Tyler had fallen fast asleep on the floor.   I do, Natalie nodded.  Sometimes you have to run away to see is someone if going to chase you.  Her dark eyes shined in the firelight and Duke found himself leaning in to kiss her.   He paused, considering what this next step would mean.  He studied her delicate features and soft lips, savoring the closeness that they were sharing at that moment.   Id chase you anywhere.  He whispered and then he pressed his lips to hers.  This was it, he decided, no more screwing around.  This was the ride he'd been waiting on for some time now.        18    February Stars      Luke had gotten as far as Ohio before his truck got a flat tire.  It wasnt a big deal, he changed it and continued on.  Another hundred miles and something under the hood started to smoke.  He was basically in the middle of nowhere and it was cold.   He slammed his hand against the steering wheel and yelled.  He had left town in such a way that he didnt have a car charger for his phone and the battery had died the day before.  He hadnt thought, he simply headed west.   Luke flipped his hazards on and popped the hood.  He stepped out into the bitter wind of the Ohio interstate and tried to figure out what was wrong this time.  Hed worked on this truck for years.  It had been passed down to him from his grandfather and was one of the only possessions he'd inherited when everyone started dying off.  Luke had babied it and had kept it running like a top.  But like everything else in this world, it could and would fail on occasion.   Maybe it was a sign.  Nothing about this trip had been going right.  If Lenny wanted to be with him she wouldve stayed, right? Obviously she had gotten whatever she had needed from her stint as a roadie and was ready to return to her real life.  I was just collateral damage, he thought cynically.   He slammed the hood down on the truck and cranked the motor.  It fired right up and Luke yanked the wheel back onto the road.  He saw the next exit fast approaching and he took it.  Why should he have to drive clear across hell and gone for her? If she wanted to talk to him, she knew where to find him.   He pointed the truck east and slammed on the gas.  Luke was tired.  He was tired from the drive, he was tired of the games, he was just too damn tired of everything.  The guys would have to get over it.  Just like he would have to get over it.             Lenny hadnt been able to get a flight that day but she called Federa and said she would only be a couple of days late.  He agreed to pick her up at the airport in Anchorage so she wouldnt have to drive to the interior alone.   That gave Lenny an extra day to wash her clothes and pack.  It was nice to have something to do keep her mind off of Luke.  She tried to stay as busy as possible, even making a few runs with Duke and Tyler.   Natalie and Tyler hung around pretty consistently and Lenny could see the bond between them and Duke growing.  Whatever feelings of jealousy she had experienced initially had completely disappeared.  Duke was a good man and he deserved a good woman.  It warmed Lennys heart to know that he wasnt going to be alone anymore.   She shoved the last of her socks in the suitcase and paused, Lukes t-shirt was neatly folded on the edge of her bed.  She bit the inside of her cheek as she considered taking it with her.  No one would know who it belonged to, only her.  She grabbed it and shoved it under her socks and zipped the suitcase shut.  She couldnt have Luke with her, she should at least be able to take a piece of him.  Especially since it felt like he had retained rights to a fairly large chunk of her heart.   She checked her phone again.  It was becoming compulsive.  Still no calls or texts.  She sat down on the edge of the bed and stared at the screen.  Her heart started to beat crazy hard as she typed out Harrison as a recipient.  What could it hurt to say, hey?  Lenny : Miss you guys, how is everything?  She pressed send and set the phone down, hands shaking.  Was it too much? Should she cut all ties? What if he didnt respond?  Lenny stood up, frustrated with herself for being so weak.  Shes the one who decided to end it.  This wasnt their fault.  The blame landed entirely on her.   Her stomach clenched when her phone chirped softly.  She grabbed at it, eager to read the reply.   Harrison: Miss you too.  Luke is a douche bag.  We want to come and see you.   Lenny smiled.  Leave it to Harrison to spill the opinion of the group.  She impulsively called him, texting would no longer suffice.   Hello? Harrison asked cautiously.   Hey, its me, Lenny greeted quietly.   Harrison sighed audibly, Did you get my reply?  Yeah, but I wanted to call.  Lenny tapped her knee with her forefinger.   Im glad you called.  Ive missed your voice.  Blake and Mike arent as nice to me as you.   They love you.  Lenny admonished with a smile.   I knowBut seriously, we were thinking about coming to see you.   Well Lenny looked over at her suitcases.  Im actually leaving in the morningfor Alaska.   The phone was quiet as Harrison processed the information.   How long will you be in Alaska?  Probably two weeks.  Its a trip for some pros and old timers.  Just for fun.  We live in these cabins with no plumbing and spend all day riding these crazy huge lines.  Its pretty awesome.   That sounds coolHow about when you get back?  Lenny paused.  She missed them.  A lot.  But wouldnt that be like joint custody in a separation? That wasnt fair to Luke, they were his friends first.  What was she even doing calling Harrison? She had no right.  She was being completely selfish.   Maybe.  Was all Lenny would commit to.  She didnt want to make it harder for her to get over Luke and she didnt want his friends to feel like they had to choose between them.   Is it okay if we call you and stuff? Harrison sounded hesitant.   Of course, you guys can always call meI might not have great reception in AK but you can leave me messages.  She tried to laugh and ease his mind.   Has Luke called you? Harrison's voice was guarded.   Lenny swallowed hard, No.   The line was quiet for a long time, neither of them really knowing what to say.   Its okay, Harry.  It has to be like this, Lenny said gently.   I disagree.  Harrison was more serious than Lenny had ever remembered hearing him.   Youll seewell stay friends and Luke will move onOne of us had to be the grown up. . .  Lenny tried to pour comfort and belief into her tone even though she didn't feel it.   We're gonna come and see you when you get back.  Youre part of us now, Lenny.  Its not the same without you around.   I appreciate that.  Lenny smiled into the phone.  She meant it.  But she knew that given enough time, they would move on too.   They would all move on.             Duke and Lenny had ridden to the airport in the Bronco quietly and he helped her get her luggage and equipment checked in.  She turned to face him, all she had to do was head through security, so this would be goodbye.  Duke motioned to a bench off to the side.   They sat down next to each other and Duke could see the emotion building on her face.  She swallowed hard, pushing back the tears that were already turning her eyes red.  Duke took one of her hands and held it both of his own.  Goodbyes were never easy but this one seemed more. . . final than ever before.   Im sorry he let you go, he said quietly.   Lenny looked away.  I cant do this here, Duke, she whispered.   Hes a fool, Lenny, Duke continued anyway.  He didn't know when he'd see her again and she needed to know these things.  Youre going to find someone who makes you as happy as you deserve someday.   Huh, Lenny laughed sardonically.  You were my backup plan.  I thought I'd come home and make a go of it with you but you had to go off and get a girlfriend.   Duke shook his head at her flippancy.  He knew she was half-serious.  She was heartbroken enough that she would have sought solace in his arms and he wouldn't have been able to say no.  But it wouldn't have been real and it would have ruined both of them.  Having Natalie cleared up a lot of his confusion in regards to his feelings for Lenny.   It would have never lasted, he said with a tender smile.   Thats not true.  Lenny put on a brave face even as large tears fell on both cheeks.  I couldve been happy with you.  I could have cooked and cleaned for you and had your babies.  Her voice broke and shuddered as she tried to continue, When I look at you. . . I see so much of what I want. . .   Duke smiled and held her cheek with his palm.  You would never have done that.  He touched her tears with his thumb.  Youre too good of a person to live a lie.   Her body crumpled against him and she sobbed into his coat, I know, I would never be able to love you like you deserve.   Duke's heart broke for her.  How could he comfort her properly? What could he say to let her know that she was strong enough? That she would heal in time and she didn't need him in order find that out?  Its time to be grownups, remember? Duke gently reminded her.  We cant keep playing house our whole lives.   Youre my best friend.  Lenny said through her tears.   And youre mine, Duke's chest burned with restrained emotion.   But everythings gonna be different now, she whispered.   Yeah, Duke nodded.  Its gonna be better.   He had spent a great deal of his life loving her, knowing the whole while that he wasnt going to be the one to experience her love returned.  She was capable of passion like an avalanche, God save the man who would be on the receiving end of it.             When Lenny got on the plane, she knew in her heart that Duke was going to be okay. . . and she would be too, eventually.  She was pretty sure that they both knew, without saying, that it was unlikely Lenny would be returning in two weeks.  Alaska had a wildness about her that matched a lot of Lennys insides.  She would stay among the danger and adventure as long as it took to heal her.  Neither of them knew how long that would be.   Lenny pulled out her notebook.  She hadnt written in it since she first started falling for Luke.  But it was time to start chronicling her hearts journey again.  She knew more about herself than before.  Now, she knew she was capable of love.  And she knew it was real.  And she knew that if she wasnt careful, it could wreck her completely.   She had thought about getting a new one.  Her old one had notes and marks in it from Luke and she thought it might be too hard to have to look at that.  But, in the end, she decided to keep it.  Luke was a part of who she was becoming and she didnt want to ignore that.  After all, he was the first man she had ever loved.  She wanted to remember that experience as honestly as possible.  And honestly, it had been the best thing that had ever happened to her.             Luke got home and immediately called a realtor.  He decided he hated his house and wanted to sell it.  He unpacked his luggage next to the trashcan in the garage.  He threw out most of his clothes instead of laundering them.  He kept a few irreplaceable things but for the for the most part, it went to the trash.  He didnt want anything around that reminded him of her.   Luke was going through the last suitcase of clothes when Mike walked into the garage.  Luke had been so focused on his task he hadnt noticed Mikes SUV pull up and park outside.   Hey, Mike greeted casually.  He leaned his long body against the bed of Lukes pickup and stuck his sunglasses in the collar of his shirt.   What are you doing here? Luke knew he wasnt being friendly but he really wasnt in the mood for more bullshit.   Hadnt talked to you in a few days Mike watched Luke throw more clothes in the trash.  I came by the other day, you werent here.   Yeah, I was stuck in Ohio.  But Im back now, Luke barked.   You change your mind? Mike asked, unfazed by Lukes demeanor.   No, Mike.  She did.  Luke looked up at Mike, his face hot with anger.  Im not the one who left.  Remember?  So thats it then? Mikes tone was flat.   What do you want me to do? Luke growled.  What, Mike! Tell me!  Have you tried calling her? Mike asked pointedly.   Luke sighed heavily.  Shes the one who left.  If she wants to talk to me, she can call me.   Wow, thats not childish at all, Mike said sarcastically.   Maybe you should keep your opinions to yourself, Luke warned darkly.   Maybe you should nut up! Mike snapped.   You know what? Luke felt his pulse pound in his neck.  I'm tired of constantly having to rescue people around me! I'm tired of trying to convince you lot to stick around! It's bullshit!  Maybe if you didn't have such a hero complex, you'd see that you're the one who needs to be rescued! From your own arrogant, asinine behavior!  Luke narrowed his eyes at his friend.  He'd never wanted to punch someone so bad in his life.   Stop being a dick! Stop making yourself a victim and look at reality! What did you expect when you got home? She would hang around, like some sort of friggin' groupie? She's so much better than that and she deserves better than that! Mike shook his head in disgust.  Nah, man.  Youre gonna have to put forth a little effort to get her back.  If you want her, go and get her.   Luke grit his teeth together.  He didnt respond to Mike.  Instead, he threw more clothes in the trash.  He finally reached the bottom of the suitcase and paused.   It was one of Lennys shirts.  It mustve gotten mixed up in the rush to pack when they were leaving Europe.  Luke touched it hesitantly.   I cant make her come back, he said quietly.             Heres a random question.  Mike was annoyed at how stubborn Luke was being.  Did you even tell her you loved her?  Luke looked up at Mike, brow furrowed.   Mike barked out a laugh of frustration and paced a short distance across the garage and turned back to Luke.   Wow, youre really thick, you know that? Mike let his hands slap against his sides in exasperation.  And you cant figure out why she left? Hello?! You never gave her a reason! You didnt even tell her you loved her, dumbass!  Luke swallowed hard, I didnt have to say it.  She knew.   What happened to not giving up on people we care about, huh? Mike shouted.  What happened to doing everything we could to keep the family together? She's a part of our family now! Why isn't she here, Luke? Mike waved an arm around the garage, amplifying his point.   You do love her, don't you?  Yes! I love her! But she left, Mike! Luke's face was crimson and the veins in his neck were starting to pulse.   So did I once, but you never gave up on me! Mike reminded him.  And I did a hell of a lot more shitty things to you than Lenny did.  What the hell are you thinking?  Luke's posture was rigid but Mike knew him better than that.  He was the most broken and defeated he'd ever been.  Why was he being so stiff-necked about this?  I know how you feel.  Mike tried to bring his voice to a reasonable decibel, despite his frustration.  She's the first woman who ever looked at you and saw past the rock star persona and straight to your soul.  You revealed things to her you never would to anyone else.  She sees more than the black and white description on Wikipedia and knows every color, shape and flaw that makes up your entire matter.  She's still the only think you think about, dream about and want.   Mike's voice choked off and he swallowed hard.  Luke stared at him, confused and shocked.  His face began to pinch as he tried to push down the rising ache that permeated his whole existence.  Mike could see it, because he'd been there.  Because he was still there.   You feel betrayed because when she left, you got sucker punched.  Any other girl and I'd tell you to get over it.  But she's not any other girl, is she? She's the only one who makes you feel alive.  She's the one who stands next to you and makes you feel like this world might not be so bad after all.  She's your song, she's your home!  Mike was about to say more when Luke cut him off.   No, were done here.  You can let yourself out.  He grabbed the empty suitcase and went into the house, locking the door behind him.   Mike rolled his eyes and went back out to his truck.  Whatever then.  He had tried.  If Luke wanted to play the blame game and not fight for the girl of his dreams that was his prerogative.   Mike and the guys were still gonna be friends with Lenny and if that made Luke uncomfortable then so be it.  Conceited, narcissistic jackass.             Luke threw the suitcase across the kitchen floor and stalked into his bedroom.  He sat down on the bed and looked at the shirt still in his hands.  He picked it up and slowly pressed it to his face.  He inhaled her scent deeply.  It was the scent that had been haunting his dreams since she had left.  He felt a lump rising in his chest and he pushed it down.  His eyes began to burn and he closed them.   For a moment, she was there with him.  Her hair falling on her shoulders and her laugh lighting up his day.  Her eyes, so blue they could have been taken straight from the oceans depths, looking at him with love and adoration.  Her hands tangled in his, her lips the perfect distance away for a kiss  He sighed and dropped his head with regret.   I dont know how to make you come back, Luke whispered to no one.   Mikes words rang through his head.  But what if she still said no? Luke didn't know if he could handle that kind of kick in the teeth.  No, it would take some time apart.  He would get over her in a while.  She wasnt any different than any other girl hed been with.  He held on to that lie, hoping that it would eventually be true.             Lenny was in Seattle for her two hour layover before the three hour flight to Anchorage.  She had already perused all the little booths and shops in the airport near her gate.  She was considering getting a coffee, but wanted to avoid having to use the lavatory on the plane.  The airport was packed with travelers and Lenny welcomed the distraction from her thoughts.   Lenny? Lenny Evans? A male voice came from behind her.   Lenny turned in her chair and stood when she recognized Ben Calloway, a guy she used to snowboard with back in the day.   Ben! Lenny greeted happily.   Lenny hadnt seen Ben in years.  They were the same age and competed in a lot of the same events growing up.  His parents moved to San Diego during high school and they didnt see much of each other after that.  Ben was immensely talented and Lenny had kept up on his achievements over the years.   The last time she saw him, he was a gangly, disproportionate eighteen year old with some serious height in the half-pipe.  He had most definitely filled out, Lenny observed.  He was at least a whole head taller, wide shoulders and muscles that were apparent through his coat.  He had the west coast, surfer boy look going, full tan and shaggy hair.   What are you doing here? He asked her eagerly.   Headed to Valdez for a couple weeks with Federa and them.   No shit! Me too!  Really? I thought I was gonna be the last to arrive.  Nick didnt mention you were coming.  Lenny was excited, she hadnt ridden with Calloway in a long time.   Yeah, I had to wrap up some stuff at home before I could leave.  Its so rad that youre coming.   Do you know who else is gonna be there? Lenny questioned.   Yeah.  Besides Federa and Serge, me, you, Smitty, Shelby Lynn, Travis Jenkins, Shane Brookings and Jimmy Trucker.   Lenny made a face at Shanes name.   Yeah, I saw all that over the X Games.  Ben laughed.  I loved how you stuck it to him.  That douche bag had it coming for a while.   EhIll have to avoid him, I suppose.  Lenny said wryly.  She wished Nick had told her that Shane was going to be there. . . oh well.   Maybe well have an appropriately timed avalanche during his run.  Ben waggled his eyebrows.   Thats not funny, Ben.  But Lenny was laughing anyway.   Man, its so good to see you.  His sincerity was obvious.  Its been years.  You lookreally good.  He nodded his head in approval.   You too.  Lenny smiled in return.  Who is Shelby Lynn? The names familiar but Im having a hard time placing her.   Shes this little daredevil from Vermont.  Shes only seventeen or something but shes blowing up the circuit right now.  Ben took a seat across from her and stretched out his long legs in front of him.   Oh yeah, I remember seeing something about her.  Shes just a kid, I cant believe Nick is taking her along.   Cmon, Lenny, Ben chided, We werent much older when Nick took us up to Valdez the first time.   Thats true.  Lenny rolled her eyes, Man, time flies.   True story.  Ben agreed shaking his messy hair out of his face.  Hey, you still with the rock star?  Lenny groaned.  Not exactly.   It was all anyone talked about after Aspen.  He raised an eyebrow at her.   Yeah, I noticed.  Lenny said dryly remembering the tabloid pictures.   What happened? Ben was just making conversation, he didnt know that it was weird for Lenny to talk about.   She wrinkled her nose.  It just didnt work out.   Was he bad in bed? Ben asked suggestively, making Lenny laugh.   It just wasnt meant to be, thats all.  Lenny hedged wishing she could find a way to get him to drop it without being rude.   Was he a jerk? Ben frowned.   No, Luke was really great.  Lenny pursed her lips.  Its still kinda raw for me so if we could not. . .   Ben nodded, understanding.  Gotcha.  Well, when you get to the phase where you want to trash him unmercifully, I have lots of good ones in my repertoire.   Lenny smiled, grateful for his consideration.  This trip was going to be fun.  Exactly what she needed to help her work through all the turmoil inside.  She didnt even mind that much that Shane was going to be there.  She felt like she had already kicked that ass and hopefully they could move on like adults.   Her mind drifted briefly to Luke.  She wondered what he was doing.  Who he was doing it with.  She blinked hard, forcing the thoughts away and concentrating on the conversation with Ben.  No reason to go there.   I havent seen Trucker in years, I had no idea he could still ride.  Lenny remarked.   Hes in the geriatrics league.  Ben joked, making Lenny laugh again.  Yes, this was going to be an excellent vacation.             Luke stared out the window of his bedroom from his back.  Sleep wouldnt come.  The sky was black, the stars floating in the darkness.  He could almost feel her forgetting him.  Didnt they have something special? Werent they different from the rest? He knew the longer he waited, the harder it would be to get her back.   He felt gutted.  Like a car that had been burned up from the inside out.  Empty and charred, waiting to be shuffled off the pavement and taken to the junk heap.  The fire leaving nothing useful behind.   He had sold his house.  He had a week to get his things out.  He didnt even have anywhere to live.  He figured hed place his stuff in storage for now.  It didnt matter.  Nothing felt like home without her there.        19    Deep Inside Of You      Luke suspected that if Lenny knew his suffering, she would feel justified somehow.  This is what she wanted, isnt it? For him to be miserable and sleepless and hard to get along with? Well, thats what had happened.   Hed been living with Sway for two days now and hated every second of it.  As relaxed and unkempt as Sway appeared to the outside world, he was surprisingly strict about his home.  To the point of obnoxious perfectionism.  A place for everything and everything had a place.  And sometimes he would want it put away before Luke was done using it.  Forty-eight hours into their living arrangement and Luke wanted to kill him.   Listen Luke, youre welcome to stay with me until you find your own place.  Sway was making his diplomatic speech for the umpteenth time.  But you have to pick up after yourself.  You didnt hang your towel straight after your shower and I had to fix it.  We dont want musty towels, do we?  Luke rolled his eyes.  You dont give a shit about cleanliness on the road.  What gives? Are you just giving me a hard time?  Thats Road Sway this is Home Sway.  Sway responded like it shouldve made perfect sense to Luke.  He walked into the living room and got his coat out of the closet.   Where you going? Luke asked.  One of the reasons he had asked to stay with Sway was for the distraction.  He thought it would be easier to not think about Lenny if he could hang out with some new girls.  And Sway was constantly drowning in women.   I have some people Im meeting up with.  Sway answered casually.   You need a wing man? Luke asked.   Sway grimaced as his words.  Wing man? Dude, were not in college anymore.  Besides, Im insulted that you think I would need a wing man.  He checked his face in the mirror by the door.  He adjusted his long, shiny hair around his shoulders.   Sorry, I just thought I could come with you.  Maybe hookup with someone.  The words sounded strange and forced, even to Luke.   Sway turned and frowned at him.  Youre looking for a hookup? He shook his head with disappointment.  Man, youre not like that.   I used to be.  Luke protested, feeling his ego getting testy.   Youre not that guy anymore.  You changed with Lenny-  At the mention of her name, Luke looked down and swore under his breath.  No one had said anything to him about her since the day Mike had visited him in the garage.  It was a touchy subject for all of them.  The guys disagreed passionately about Lukes complacency.  And Luke was determined to prove them wrong.  He was just doing the worst job at it.   I know you dont want to talk about her and shit but lets be real for a second.  Sway was trying to sound laid back so Luke wouldnt feel threatened but he saw through it.  You guys had something real.  Ive never had that with anyoneBut seeing you guys together gave me hope that I could have it someday too.   What? Are you saying youre done being a dog and youre gonna turn into a respectable human being? Luke knew his words were too harsh but he didnt care.             Sway wasnt fazed.  He was fine being the one Luke took his hurt feelings out on.  Yeah, Im working on it.  He paused as he rested his hand on the doorknob.  You cant come with me tonight, I have a date.  A real one.  Actually, Sway was on his third date with the same girl this week.  It was totally new for him.  He saw the confusion and disbelief in Lukes eyes and took compassion on him, We can hang when I get home, I wont be out too late.  He promised.   He opened the door and looked at his friend one more time.  One of these days Luke was going to have to come to terms with his own hardheadedness.  He needed that girl more than he knew.  They all did.             Luke tried watching TV for a while but there was nothing on.  He wondered what Mike was up to.  They used to hang out all the time when they were off tour.  But Luke didnt want to call him and get another stupid lecture.  Mike had no right to tell him how to handle this, he wasnt the one in love with Lenny.  Shit.   Luke stood up angrily.  He was getting so sick of his head leading him back to the same damn train of thought.  He didnt want to think about her anymore.  It was needless heartache.  She was gone and she wasnt coming back.  He found himself staring at his phone.  Not just his phone, he had already cued up Lennys number and his thumb was hovering over send.  He stood still for a long time, debating in his head if he should call her or not.   He shoved his phone back in his pocket and got his jacket from the closet.  He didnt want to talk to her.  What else could she say that she hadnt already said.  He didnt need to hurt himself on purpose.  He left the apartment and went out into the Boston night.             Lenny thought she heard her cellphone ring and took it out to look at it.  Nope.  She didnt even have a signal.  That was weird.  She frowned at the display, she was so sure she had heard it ring  Something going on on your phone? Ben asked from beside her.   She shook her head and put her phone back.  I thought I heard it ring but it didnt.  She couldnt shake the feeling that someone was trying to call her.   You probably wont get too many calls in Thompson Pass, Nick said from the front seat.  Youll have a better signal in Valdez.   Lenny just nodded without voicing her thoughts.  She looked out the window of the SUV at the frozen landscape.   It had been years since she had first laid eyes on the beauty of the Alaskan terrain.  Valdez boasted an annual snowfall average of 300 inches with some 600-900 more in the surrounding areas.  Which is exactly where they were headed.  The stark contrast of the crisp white snow against the brilliant blue of the sky made Lennys heart quicken just a tad.  Alaska had always felt like a second home to her.   Its great that you could join us this year, Len.  Nick was saying from the drivers seat.  They were barreling down the highway, trying to beat the oncoming snowfall.  It was an easy six hour drive inland from Anchorage as long as weather permitted.   Yeah, Lenny agreed, not really listening.  All she could think about was how much more amazing this would all be if Luke and the guys were here.             Ben frowned thoughtfully at Lenny.  She kept drifting in an out of being totally fine to being completely somewhere else.  They had been able to talk quite a bit on the plane ride up, getting reacquainted and rebuilding their neglected friendship.  Nick couldnt pick them up until morning and they had both opted to just stay the night in the airport rather than get a hotel.   It was fun, they spread their coats out on the floor by the heaters and laid head to head.  They continued talking and joking until they got too tired and both fell asleep.  Ben had been awakened when Lenny had reached above her head and smacked his face for snoring.   He never felt like he had ever really gotten to know Lenny completely.  She had always been this whirlwind of ambiguity.  She wasnt shy but she didnt flirt either.  Ben was naturally attracted to her and he was usually very good with women but Lenny treated him more like a kid brother than anything else.  He didnt mind, they had the whole trip to get to know each other better.  And Ben was looking forward to showing Lenny how much of a kid he wasnt.             I thought maybe you and Shelby Lynn could share a cabin.  Nick was still talking to Lenny.  You know, since youre the only girls.   Yeah, that sounds good.  Lenny turned her attention back inside the vehicle, her thoughts momentarily put on hold.   Unless you want one to yourself, I can try to arrange that , too.  Nick put in.   No, Ill share.  I hate staying alone.   You probably wouldnt have to stay alone for long.  Ben said under his breath.  Lenny frowned at him but he just shook his head like he hadnt said anything at all.  She knew what he was implying, but nothing was going to happen there.  Ever.   She doesnt snore, does she? Lenny raised an eyebrow at Ben.  'Cause Ill probably have to smack her.             I dont know about the snoring, youll have to let me know.  Nick chuckled from the front seat.  He glanced in the rear view mirror and saw the brief exchange between Ben and Lenny.  He grimaced inwardly.   The wonderful thing about having Lenny along was that she was probably the best rider in the group and would be able to teach the others a thing or two.  The hard part was that she was too damn pretty and too damn nice.  Nick had promised to take over for Duke in looking out for her among all these dudes.  But it was going to be difficult.  Hopefully they would get enough snowfall that there wouldnt be much downtime for them to get bored and start looking for other forms of entertainment.  Especially since Nick knew that Lenny could take care of herself.  He didnt want to be taking guys into town for broken bones and what not.   Nick Federa was forty years old this year.  He had been doing big mountain riding nearly his whole life.  Duke had been his best friend and riding partner for most of it.  Nick enjoyed nothing more than to get a bunch of pros all together for a couple of weeks a year in what he considered his backyard.  He always tried to invite a variety of riders, guys and girls.  But usually the girls opted out.  The ones that did make it were pretty fearless and would, on occasion, scare the shit out of him completely.   This year was no different.  The group that had come together consisted of legends and rookies but all freaks in their own right.  No one looked forward to snowfall more than this group of crazies.   Hows the weather looking for the week? Ben asked Nick.   So far so good.  But you know as much as I do.  That can change.  He chuckled to himself.  He loved the unpredictability of living in the mountains.   How soon till we can get on the heli? Lenny piped in.   Damn, youre ready to get to it, arent you? Ben said with appreciation.   Oh, probably tomorrow morning, Ill have to check with Jack.  Nick answered.   Kay.  Lenny gave a half-smile and looked back out the window.             They pulled into the little area where they would camp.  Tiny cabins with no plumbing and a couple of nearby outhouses.  It was not the most glamorous of setups but no one was there for the amenities.  A main Lodge was the focal point of the cul-de-sac.  It had plumbing and a staffed kitchen and full service bar.  Thats where the riders would spend most of their down time.  It was nice and rustic with an old pool table and a couple of big screens thrown in for entertainment during blizzards.   Lenny helped unload her gear and Nick directed her to her cabin.  She opened the door to the tiny room and smiled.  It had been a long time since she was here.  The cabin only held what it needed to.  It was one room with one set of bunks and one small window.  A short table under the window held a few items that belonged to Shelby Lynn and the heater in the corner was roaring.  The bunks were piled with blankets and sleeping bags and a single light bulb hung from the ceiling with a pull string.   Lenny set her stuff down and gratefully accepted the top bunk.  Shelby Lynns things were obviously claiming the bottom even though Shelby wasnt there herself.  Probably in the Lodge.  Lenny thought to herself.  Smart girl, dont wanna isolate yourself in this world of testosterone.   Lenny left her things and trudged through the snow over to the Lodge.  She might as well join everyone right away.  She had been away from the entire snowboarding culture for so long, she wasnt sure what to expect.  Would she have to prove herself all over again? Would they welcome her with open arms the way Ben had? Would she be shunned and rejected?  She opened the door to the Lodge and it took a second for her eyes to adjust from the brilliant snow outside to the darker interior.  She tried to gauge where she should be as she looked around the open space.  It was pretty full since it was a destination restaurant for a lot of folks in Valdez, not just for those staying in the cabins.  She took off her coat in the warm interior and hung it on a nearby hook with others.  She startled a little when someone came up beside her and put an arm around her shoulders.   Were all in the back at the bar.  Ben said as he guided her that direction.   Lenny was relieved that she wasnt left to fend for herself but she was growing a tad uncomfortable with Bens familiarity with her.  She shrugged her shoulders subtly to push his arm away.  He didnt resist, instead he walked ahead of her to the group.   Hey everyone, look whos here! He announced Lenny to the group of snowboarders who were having a casual drink at the bar.  Lenny gave a small wave and swallowed.  Here we go, she thought.   Serge immediately patted the stool to his left and motioned with his head for her to join him.  She smiled gratefully and took a seat.   Serge was a legend among legends.  He was arguably the greatest rider in the world.  His talent and technique were unrivaled.  Quiet and soft spoken but he always meant whatever he said.  His immediate acceptance of her relieved Lenny.  That meant that no one else would have a problem with her either.   Serge didnt say much but he bought her a beer and listened to the others talk about their run earlier that day.  Lenny relaxed into the conversation.  It was fun getting to talk to others who loved what she loved and did what she did.  The Lodge was full of activity and soft country music played from a nearby jukebox.  It made her heartache seem more bearable.   Nick, Smitty, Ben and Shane were playing a game of pool nearby.  The rest of the crew was lined up at the bar facing outward.  Next to Serge was Jimmy Trucker, a long haired hippy from Wisconsin who hadnt competed in more than ten years.  Next to Jimmy was Shelby Lynn, blonde, unruly hair and sweet innocence wrapped in a stick of dynamite.  Next to Shelby Lynn was Travis Jenkins, eight-teen year old superstar from Washington who thought he was a lot cooler than he actually was.   Shelby Lynn and Travis gravitated towards each other naturally because of the age similarity.  They had more in common with each other than with the older riders.   Smitty was around the same age as Nick.  They had been friends for years, competing in the same circuits and then eventually leaving the competitive side for the same reasons.  Smitty used to keep his red hair long but had cut it when he turned forty so he would look more respectable.  Smitty and Trucker had been along for Lennys first trip to AK six years ago and it was comforting to see familiar faces.   And then there was Shane.  He kept his eyes focused on the game of pool but they would occasionally flick up to look at Lenny.  She wasnt sure how to act with him, they didnt leave things very good in Aspen but maybe they could move past it.  He seemed more subdued than his usual, flashy self.   You looking forward to getting some heli time tomorrow? Serge asked from beside her.   Serge was from Norway but his English was perfect.  Lenny could only detect a slight accent if she listened really hard.   Yes.  Lenny nodded emphatically.  How was it today?  Good.  He gestured to the pool game, Smitty took a bad fall but he says he is okay.  He nodded over his shoulder at the rookies.  They are a little skittish on the big hills still, he said quietly, his eyes locked with Lennys.  I was hoping you would be looking for some good vertical tomorrow.   Lenny felt her mouth pull into a half-smile.  Absolutely.  Serge had a reputation for pushing the limits of what was physically possible and Lenny felt privileged that he would include her.   Saw the footage of you in Aspen.  That was impressive for not having ridden in two years.  He was fishing, trying to see if her hiatus had been real or if she had made up the whole thing for a more dramatic comeback.   When you want it, you want it.  Was all Lenny would reveal.  Serge smiled at her response and saluted her with his beer.   She felt her phone buzz in her pocket and pulled it out.  Her heart almost stopped when she saw Lukes number on the screen.  She excused herself and stepped over to a corner that was more quiet.   Hello? She asked, her hands and voice shaking.   Lenny heard lots of voices at once, like from a club or restaurant.  She thought maybe he had accidentally pocket dialed her and then he spoke.   Hello? He was speaking loudly and didnt sound like himself.   Luke? Lenny asked, confused.   Lenny? Luke asked in return.  Lenny could hear giggling in the back ground.   Are you drunk? Lenny was trying to stay calm but she could feel her neck heating up.  Did he really call her while he was with another girl?  I might be drunk.  Luke laughed loudly.   Why are you calling me? Lenny asked forcefully.   Im calling cuzhold on.  She heard him moving around and it got quieter in the background.  He mustve moved to a different room.   Lenny? Luke asked.   Im still here, she answered.   It was quiet for a few seconds and Lenny swallowed the lump that had formed in her throat.   I miss you, Luke finally said.   I miss you too, she replied.  And she did.  Oh, how she missed him.   I need you to come back.  His words were slurred and Lenny knew for sure that he was drunk.  Just come home to me and we can fix this whole mess.   Im in Alaska, Luke- she started but he interrupted.   Why? Are you with Duke? I know hes in love with you! Is that why you left me? For him? His tone was suddenly combative.  Definitely drunk.   No.  Duke is back home.  I didnt leave you for anyone.  Lenny knew that trying to explain anything to him in this state would be useless.  Her arms ached to hold him.   You said you loved me Lukes voice broke and Lenny could feel tears starting to form in her eyes.   I do love you, Luke, she whispered.   Then you why did you leave? His voice kept swinging from heartbroken to angry.   Luke, we cant have this conversation when youre drunk, she pleaded with him.  Call me tomorrow, well talk then,  Luke seemed to consider her request.  He sighed heavily, Okay.  Ill call tomorrowLenny?  Yeah?  I love you, you know.   I know.   She hung up the phone, her heart heavier than when she started out that day.  Words of love could only mean so much spilling from the lips of a drunk.  She hoped he would call her tomorrow but knew the chances that he would even remember their conversation was unlikely.   She put her phone back in her pocket and rejoined her group.  Ben had noticed her tense phone conversation and came to sit beside her on the vacant stool.   You wanna talk about it? he asked.   No, Lenny smiled at him apologetically.  Sorry, I just wouldnt know what to say I guess.  She pushed her beer away, suddenly disgusted by the taste.   Let me know if I can help in any way.  Ben said sincerely.   I will.  Lenny smiled and flagged the bartender down.  She ordered some club soda and eased her way back into the conversation around the bar.  She tried to not be distracted by her recent phone call.  She had wanted him to call so badly.  But she hadnt wanted him to call while he was drunk.  She tried to push the memory of the girlish giggles in the background far from her thoughts.  They werent together, he was allowed to do whatever he wanted.             Luke got home late that night.  He didnt really know how hed gotten home, he just knew he was there now.  Trying to get his key to go into the lock.  He staggered and fell down in the hallway.  He looked up at the door knob and frowned.  His eyes couldnt quite focus and he blinked hard to clear the fog.  He pushed himself back into a standing position and tried again.   Suddenly the door opened and Sway hauled him inside.   What the hell? Sway was angry, Luke could tell and it cracked him up.  He laughed loudly at Sway's cranky expression.   Where have you been? Sway demanded as Luke stumbled and then fell in the living room.   I went out, Luke slurred and tried to stand up again.             Sway stared at him, in complete shock.  Luke hadnt gotten drunk in years.  This was so unlike him.  This was the old Luke.  The Luke none of them could stand.   You smell like the perfume counter at Macys, Sway accused.   Yeah, Luke laughed as he found a seat on the couch, Girls like me.   Youre joking, right? Sway was beyond disappointed.  Luke looked like hell.  His clothes were all a mess and his shirt was barely buttoned.  Sway had had enough.   Youre an asshole! He shouted at Luke.  Luke winced but didnt say anything.  Youre in love with Lenny! What have you done?!  Luke stood up angrily.  She left me, Sway! She left me! Luke shouted back.   So that makes it okay to screw some nobody! Sway was shaking with fury.   No! Luke was shaking his head in protest, confused by his own foggy memories and his overwhelming grief.  I just bought some drinks.  I didnt His voice faltered, too drunk to think clearly.  I didnt want to be alone He collapsed back onto the sofa and hung his head.   Its just as well she left, Sway said sharply, You never deserved her.  He slammed the door to his bedroom, leaving Luke alone in the dark.        20    Learn To Fly      Blake had gone down to the corner store to get a few things.  Nothing crucial; fresh produce and some milk.  He carried his basket to the counter and waited patiently in line.  His eyes casually browsed the tabloid covers, just like anyone else would.  He paused on one in particular.  He blinked his eyes hard and squinted, thinking he was seeing things.  He grabbed the magazine off the rack and stuck it in his basket.  He kept his face stoic as he paid for his items and left.   In the elevator ride up to his loft, Blake pulled the magazine out and studied the cover again.  He hadnt been seeing things.  It was a picture of Luke making out with some chick.  The headline read: LUKE CASEY CAUGHT CHEATING! LENNA HUMILIATED AND IN HIDING!  Blake stepped out of the elevator and quickly opened the door to his loft.  He set his purchases down on the counter and opened the cheaply printed multicolored pages.  Normally, he would never even look at these types of stories.  They were always false and misleading, designed to cause trouble.  But the sickening feeling in Blakes stomach forced him to look at the rest of the photos.   The magazine had a full spread on Lukes indiscretions.  He was pictured sitting in a bar with an unknown girl on his lap.  His shirt was unbuttoned and her hands were all over his chest.  The article quoted eye witnesses as describing Luke to be very drunk and making out and dancing with several women all night long.   Blake ground his teeth together.  This was a local, overnight publication, meaning that the events had happened within the past twenty-four hours and usually within the city limits.  But it would go national in a few days.  Lenny would see it eventually.  That was it.  Blake knew, Luke had lost her forever.             Luke climbed out of unconsciousness in the spare room of Sways apartment, his head throbbing.  He sat up slowly and winced at the added pain from the minimal effort.  He rested his head in his hands as he swung his legs to the floor, trying to clear the fog that had built up in his mind.  He couldnt remember anything from last night but he knew he felt terrible.   His stomach felt like he had swallowed pure acid and he wasnt sure if he was going to throw up or not.  He hadnt been this hungover in a very long time.  He looked down at the clothes he was still wearing from the night before and flashes of memory fired through his brain but he couldn't tell what was real and what had been a dream.   He stood up and made his way to the bathroom for a hot shower.  As the steam swirled around him, he tried to focus his thoughts, deciphering reality from nightmare.  He had gone to a bar.  He kind of remembered Sway being pissed at him when he came home.   He got out of the shower and dried himself off, no better than when he had woken up.  He was getting dressed when Sway started yelling at him to come out into the living room.   Whats up man? Luke wasnt sure if this was just a continuation of their fight from last night or if this was something new.  He really wished he could remember more.   Sway threw a cheap magazine on the table and Luke was even more confused than he had been a moment ago.   You cant stay here.  Sway said calmly, his jaw working under his skin.  Not if youre gonna live like this.   Luke frowned and walked over to the tabloid, squinting at the cover.  His eyes widened and he flipped to the inside.  His stomach lurched and bile rose in his esophagus as he was confronted with the decisions hed made the night before.  The memories came back in a blurry rush and he staggered to the sofa to sit down, unable to speak.   Does this mean you dont want Lenny anymore? Sway asked, his face flat and emotionless.   Luke looked around, trying to get his bearings.  Thats not what he had wanted at all.  He just wanted to feel differently than how hed been feeling.  He looked back at the photos with sudden realization, he didnt want her to see these.   He quickly pulled out his phone and checked his call history.  He had called her last night.  He closed his eyes and tried to concentrate but he couldnt remember what they had talked about.  He looked up at Sway with desperation.   No, his voice cracked, Shes the only one I want.   Sway shook his head and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand.   Did you sleep with any of those girls? Sway asked, his face cold and dispassionate.   The memories were muddy but he could almost put them in order now.   No.  I came straight home from the bar, alone.  Luke was positive of that.  It didnt matter how drunk he had gotten, his goal hadnt been to get laid.   Sway sighed and paced across the living room a few times.  I dont know how youre gonna fix it.  You know shes gonna see this eventually.   Luke thought he had reached the lowest point in his emotional fortitude the day before.  But this was a whole new level of loss.  How was he ever going to get her back now? She was so much better than his behavior dictated.  She deserved better than him, no wonder she had left.   Why had he been so determined to prove that he didn't need her? At this point, when he realized what a life without her actually looked like, he knew what kind of a moron he really was.  The worst kind.   He'd regressed to old habits to ease his pain and in doing so, may have destroyed any opportunity to get back the one woman that mattered to him.   Maybe Sway began and Luke looked up at him, hope making a tentative step back into his heart.  I might have an idea Sway grimaced at him.  But let's be clear about something, I am not pleased with your actions.  You've really messed up this time.  Luke nodded in agreement.  But you've bailed all of us out at one time or another, the least we can do is help you pull your head out of your ass.  He sighed with disappointment and ran his hand through his hair, We have to have a family meeting.             Lenny awoke with a smile.  The skies were clear and powder was waiting.  She dressed quickly and quietly in the early morning, careful not to wake Shelby Lynn who had gone to bed far too late.  All that flirting with Travis Jenkins, Lenny snickered to herself.   She practically ran to the Lodge for breakfast.  She yanked open the door and was greeted with the smell of pancakes and bacon, her stomach growled in happy anticipation.   Ben and Serge waved to her from a table near the back and she joined them.  Taking off her coat and hanging it on the back of her chair, she sat down across from Serge and next to Ben.   Good morning! She greeted as she poured herself a steaming cup of coffee from the pot on the table.   Youre in a good mood this morning, Ben noticed out loud.   Uh, duh.  Im in freaking Alaska, Lenny deadpanned.  Serge chuckled softly at her.   Here, fill up.  Ben passed her a platter of food and she gladly dug in.   Nick is gonna take us out for a test run first, Serge said.  Then well meet up with the others at their chosen location.   Lenny circled the table with her finger, Just us?  Serge nodded but didn't pause in eating.   You think you can hang with the big dogs? Ben teased from next to her.   Do you? Lenny countered with one eyebrow up, taking another bite of pancakes.  She really enjoyed how being at a higher altitude meant you could eat more calories.   Smitty is teaching the kids how to build a jump out of nothing, Ben added.   Nice.  I hope they give me a crack at it.  I havent gotten a chance to run one of Smittys kickers in a long time, Lenny said thoughtfully.   Remember when Duke wrecked last time you were here? Serge mentioned with a smirk.   Gosh, yes! I thought he was gonna kill himself that trip.  Lenny shook her head at the memory.   I woulda done it too had I known that you were playing nurse that weekend.  Ben laughed and winked at Lenny.   What? Lenny smiled, confused.   Well, it was obvious that Duke was being more reckless to get your attention.  We assumed it was because he got to spend more one on one time with you.   Oh, stop, Lenny made a face.  She knew Duke had feelings for her but it was a shock to find out that everyone else knew before she did.  What else didn't she know?  Yeah, he threatened all of us to back off.  Ben laughed at Lennys face.   Dont worry, Lenny, Serge said seriously, If anyone wrecks this week, Ill play nurse.   Lenny laughed at Serges dry humor.  She knew he sensed her awkwardness at this particular topic and she was thankful for his appropriately timed joke.   Can I join you guys?  Lenny looked up to see Shane standing at the vacant chair.  He was addressing Lenny specifically.  His unflinching eye contact made her heart skip momentarily.   I dont mind.  Lenny responded with a casual smile and then looked back to her food.  That was weird.  She was not going to let him get under her skin.   Shane took a seat and began filling his plate.  The table was quiet for a few minutes and Lenny couldnt help but feel responsible for that.  She was the one who had aired Shanes horrible transgressions to the entire world.  And these had been his comrades, his teammates.  They shouldnt have had to choose sides in a personal problem that was between Lenny, Shane and Cody.   Are you coming with us in the heli, Shane? Lenny asked awkwardly.  Shed just a soon put the past behind them.  If that meant she had to be the bigger person, than so be it.   Yeah, Nick asked me if Id go so he could help Smitty with the jump.  Shane kept his face flat and didnt look up from his food.  If thats okay with you, that is, he added at the end.   Lenny swallowed as Ben and Serge looked at her for a response.   Of course.  Were all here for the same reasons, right? She smiled nervously.  To get some good vertical rides in?  Serge nodded his approval and went back to eating.  Ben studied Lennys face longer than she was comfortable with and she started to chew on the inside of her cheek.   Shane didnt respond at all.  He poured himself a cup of coffee and continued eating.  Lenny suddenly felt bad about what she had done to him a few weeks back.  This man at the table was not the same flashy, egocentric playboy she had spent so much time hating.  This was all new territory.   Before long, they were waiting outside for the helicopter pilot, Jack.  They had their gear ready and Lenny could feel her pulse quicken.  Being taken to a high peak and dropped off by a helicopter was one of her favorite experiences.  Nothing compared.  Well, maybe kissing Luke.  Lenny tried to shake that thought off as quickly as it had crept up on her.   The heli started to get warmed up and they loaded their gear inside.  Soon they were cleared to board and take off.  The scenery of the Alaskan mountains was breathtaking.  Serge spoke with the pilot and they scouted out a stately peak.  All the passengers disembarked onto the snowy top and watched the heli fly away.   Lenny pulled her hat a little lower on her ears as the wind whipped past her face.  She was terrified and excited at the same time.  Duke would have never allowed her to get to a height of this kind.  He had always restricted how much alone time she spent with Serge.  He was afraid Serge was a bad influence on Lennys fearlessness and would encourage her to be more risky than was necessary.  Lenny felt like a rebellious teenager hanging out with the bad boy in home room.  She looked at Serge, he was all business.  This kind of extreme was why he had made the trip to begin with.   Who wants to go first? Serge asked the group of them after the helicopter had gotten far enough away to hear each other.   Ben looked more nervous than Lenny had ever seen him.  Shane was too.  Serge seemed to be the only one ready for a ride of this magnitude.   Ill go first.  Lenny found herself volunteering.  Her heart was stuck in her throat.  She liked to be first to descend for a lot of reasons.  The main one being to pick your own line without anyones influence.  But the added bonus of looking like a badass in front the boys was cool too.   She couldnt see Serges expression behind his goggles and face mask but his approval was apparent in his posture.   Thats insane! Ben protested.  You havent dropped a line in too long to be the first at this height.  He took a step to get in front of Lenny to stop her.   Shane put in arm up, pushing Ben back slightly.  Ben frowned at him, perplexed.   Dude.  Shes got this.  Shane said confidently.   Lenny looked up , surprised at Shanes sudden support.  He was looking at her with different eyes.  She had noticed something strange the first night at camp but couldnt quite place it.  He was avoiding direct eye contact most of the time anyway.  But not now.  Now, he was looking at Lenny with eyes of a man who had too many regrets and had decided to do something about it.   You're kidding, right? Ben was incredulous.   Shane kept his eyes on Lenny as he answered calmly.  Shes gonna be just fine, Calloway.  Shes the best.  He said it without a hint of sarcasm and Lenny tried to downplay the shock that rippled through her.   Ben shook his head like he thought Shane had lost his mind, Lenny knew how he felt.  But she wasn't going to let anyone else know that.   Whyd you come up here if you didnt want to play? Lenny teased.  The adrenaline was starting to kick into high gear.   I just dont think you should go first.  Ben grumbled when it was obvious he had lost the argument.   Serge stood back, completely relaxed, waiting for the squabble to clear.  Lenny envied his cool focus.   She dug out her chute and fastened her binders.  She grinned at the guys and lowered her goggles, giving a final dramatic salute for beginning her descent.   She started out slowly on her vertical.  The angle was steep, probably fifty degrees or more.  She was careful, feeling her way as she went.  She didnt want to jump past the hard parts and fly to the end.  She wanted to enjoy this, every death defying, exhilarating moment.   Interestingly enough, a drum beat started to resonate in her head.  It was the opening song for Double Blind Study on the tour.  She didnt feel sad or weird, it felt good.  And motivating.  As her board started its expert curve down the extreme slope she heard the guitar riff join in and her heartbeat quickened.   The sky was an overwhelming blue.  Deep and clear at the same time.  The white landscape was bare and open, waiting for her to carve a line right through it.  She bent and twisted, feeling the fresh powder cave and respond, propelling her forward.  She would speed up and then slow down, controlling her movements, controlling her momentum.   Lenny was flying.  She hadnt felt freedom like this in a long time.  Far longer than she cared to think about.  The air was as clean and pristine as the snow she was slashing in.  Her line curved and arced, throwing clouds of powder around her.  Creating a beautiful effect for her brilliant blue riding suit to burst through.             Shane felt a grin spread across his face behind his mask.  He knew she would be fine.  He watched in appreciation.  He knew Lenny was good.  He had just never realized how good.  It was like the mountain belonged to her and changed to make her path possible.   Alright, Calloway, Serge said from behind him and clapped his hand on the kid's shoulder, Youre up.   Ben nodded but he was still pretty nervous.   You got this, kid.  Shane said with a pat on the shoulder.  You can follow Lennys line all the way down, shes not as crazy as Duke.   Shane waited till Ben got started and then he turned to Serge.   I assume youll be last.  He nodded at the composed Norwegian.  Serge stepped aside in answer, giving Shane room to pick a chute.   In the past, Shane would have never taken this trip.  He had always preferred to ride maintained parks and pipes.  Back country riding scared him beyond belief.  But after losing Lenny permanently and than having his idiocy thrown around the media, he realized that even playing it safe, you can make a mess.   He started small, little trips to the unpopulated runs, trying out fresh powder and learning the feel of riding untamed terrain.  It didnt take long for him to get hooked.  And when Federa invited him to come to Alaska, he jumped at the chance.  This was his largest descent as well but he wasnt scared of the ride.  The thing that scared Shane was dressed in blue and coming to a stop at the bottom of the mountain.             Lenny came to a halt and pushed up her goggles.  She was breathless and heated up from her ride so she removed her face mask and hat as well.  She turned to watch Ben cut a smooth line very near hers.  It made her feel good, she had blazed a trail to be proud of.   She watched in curiosity as Shane started his own run.  He was a little further away from where she had started.  She had never seen him ride big mountains before.  All the time they were together, he had made it abundantly clear that he was not into that sort of thing.  He was good in the pipe and that had always been his focus.  She was curious as to what had changed his mind.   Ben slid up next to her, and pushed his coverings off his face.  He had a goofy grin plastered on and he gave Lenny a high-five.   Shane made his descent with precision and Lenny was impressed.  When he reached them at the bottom she impulsively patted his shoulder in congratulations.  Shane took off his goggles and gave Lenny a warm look.   Bet you didnt think I could pull it off.  He said with a sideways smile.   Im not gonna lie, I was a little surprised.  Lenny tried to read his expression but he looked away from her inquisitive stare.  Whatever had happened to Shane was a very big deal.  He was like a brand new person.   Damn, check out Serge Ben said with awe.   They all turned to observe the living legend take his turn raging down the face.  It was a thing of beauty.  Serge moved with the fluidity of a spider in an intricate web; in and out, back and forth.  The snow bursting from beneath his board as if announcing his arrival to the rest of the world.   Do you think he knows how good he is? Lenny wondered out loud.   Hes definitely fearless, Shane remarked.  Im not that brave.  He glanced at Lenny with adoration.  Lenny is, though.   Lenny smiled wistfully, still staring at Serges perfect form and style.   Sometimes, she agreed noncommittally.   When Serge finished his run and humbly accepted the group's praise, he radioed the heli and Jack swung around to pick them up again.  They flew a short distance away to a smaller slope where Nick and Smitty had helped the youngins build a jump.   Youre gonna fly a hundred feet off that thing! Nick was hollering at Smitty.  They were having an argument about the safety of the jump theyd just finished.   That was the plan, dummy.  Smitty wiped the sweat off his brow and squinted up the hill.  It aint fun unless you can get hurt.   Maybe for you and me, thats true.  But theyre just kids.  Nick protested.   Would you calm down? Smitty was losing his patience.  They dont have to try it if they dont want to.  No one is forcing them.   Nicks mouth twitched in agitation.  Smitty was right, but he didnt have to like it.   At the top of the run, the other riders were nervously preparing.  No one was talking about their anxiety, they were all pretending like they had none.  Lenny laughed to herself.  She remembered feeling that way at that age too.  Like, if you act like youre invincible than maybe you will be.   So, who wants to try it first? Lenny asked with a grin.   Its Smittys kicker, maybe he should go first.  Trucker suggested.   Ill go first.  Travis Jenkins suddenly spoke up.  He wanted to prove his manhood, no doubt.  The competitiveness surrounding the entire outing was thick enough to choke on.   Lenny sidled up to Travis as he tightened his bindings.   Hey.  She took a knee next to him and gazed out over the stark white landscape.  We can do this run all day.  Save your big stuff for after you get to know the run a few times.  Jenkins had a rep for being flashy and bold in the pipe and on the freestyle course.  Lenny didnt want his day to be cut short just because he didnt find the right balance.   Travis frowned at her, trying to not to hear her words as a challenge.   All Im saying is, Lenny continued, reading his hesitation, This isnt a park.  Its okay to be scared.  If youre not a little bit frightened, the mountain will eat you alive.  She patted his shoulder as he nodded at her words and got into a standing position.   As Travis traveled down the packed, slick run towards the ramp, Lenny watched in satisfaction.  He was controlling his speed and making the slight adjustments that an experienced rider would make.  He took the jump at a pretty strong velocity and spun into the air.  She could see him tracking the landing already.  He set down with a wobble but didnt lose his balance.  She was happy he had taken her advice.   Then it was Truckers turn.  Jimmy Trucker was always reckless and never smart.  He was addicted to the thrill and possibly the crash.  He let out a loud whoop and took off going at a ridiculous speed.  The moment he flew into the air, Lenny knew hed lost control.  He didnt just crash, he rolled and bounced and crashed repeatedly.  His board disengaged and his body continued on, getting buried slightly in the snow he had disturbed on his way down.   Everyone waited for movement before rushing to him.  He flopped over on his back and let out a loud moan.   Ill check him.  Lenny said, tightening her binders.  She was cautious on the slick run but had achieved a good speed when she reached the jump.  As she flew into the air she got the distinct impression that she was indeed flying this time.  She did a quick method to please the onlookers and tracked her landing.  The snow was rough and uneven from where Trucker had epically wiped out.  She tried to place her board in as smooth a location as she could find at her altitude.  Little wobble, nothing she couldnt handle.  She turned her board sideways and skidded to a halt near Truckers crumpled form.   Unhooking her bindings, she jogged over to him and peered down into his face mask.   Some things never change, Truck, she said with mock disappointment.   He groaned in response.  Thats not true.  Im a heck of a lot older this year.   Lenny laughed and began to check his body for broken bones before trying to move him.  Satisfied that it was just a couple of bumps, she helped him into a sitting position.   Thanks, Len, Trucker grimaced at the pain in his ribs as she helped pull him to a standing position.   Youre done for the day, Lenny said apologetically.   Yeah, I hope I can move in the morning.  Trucker attempted a laugh and then held his side.   Let me take a look at those ribs.  Lenny peeled off his coat and pulled his shirt up to expose his left side.  It was red and already swollen; tender to the touch.  You might have a few cracked ribs, Truck, she said with concern.   You know what they say, big mountain thrills equal hospital bills.  Trucker tried to laugh again.   Maybe you should go back to camp, Lenny suggested tentatively.   Nah, Ill be fine.  Trucker dismissed her with a wave as he pulled his coat back on.  I wanna see how everyone else fairs.   Okay, Lenny relented and trudged over to collect her board.  But stay down here, I meant what I said, youre done riding for the day, she instructed seriously.   Whatever you say, mama.  Trucker smiled and walked over to join Travis who had been watching from a distance.   Lenny whirled, expecting to see Blake but no, it was still Trucker.  No one had called her that in a few weeks and it ignited her repressed heartache.  She shook it off as she climbed back up to the start where the others awaited.   Is he okay? Shelby Lynn looked scared.   Yeah, hes fine.  Lenny waved it off.  Hes just gonna be sore tomorrow.   She took this as a teaching opportunity and addressed the remaining riders.   Smitty builds some pretty gnarly jumps, guys.  Take your first run easy.  Learn it first before you trick it.  She pointed at Jimmy Trucker.  Or youll spend the rest of the trip watching.  And thats not why youre here.   They nodded like obedient children and Lenny suppressed a laugh.  A few years ago, no one would have taken her seriously.  And now she was one of the adults.  Bossing around rock stars all summer had its benefits.   Ben went next and then Shelby Lynn.  Eventually, everyone took a turn.  All of them followed Lennys advice and kept it cautious for the first few runs.  They started to get brave and added in little grabs, flips and rotations as they got more comfortable.   Did I impart wisdom? Lenny asked Serge as they looked on.   He only gave his quiet, knowing smile.  Lenny enjoyed being near Serge.  His energy was both calming and ferocious.  He reminded her of a cat.  He could be completely relaxed one minute, eyes half lidded, nearly asleep and then on the move, twisting and hurtling down the mountainside the next.   Cmon, Lenny! Nick called from the top of the slope, Show us something special.   Lenny smiled and removed her jacket.  Even though they were surround by snow, the sun and extra activity was making them all warm.  Travis had long since removed his shirt, much to the joy of Shelby Lynn, and Lenny decided to be more comfortable as well.  She took off her hat and outer shirt, stripping to her black snow pants and orange tank top.  She lowered her goggles and her blonde hair hung in sweaty strands down her back.  Serge offered her a fist bump as she strapped in.   The slope was even more slick than before because of all the activity but Lenny liked the extra speed it provided.  She would need it for what she was about to attempt.             You have to cool it, Calloway.  Serge said from next to Ben.  Ben turned, eyes wide with surprise and confusion.   What?  You are not the one.  Serge said calmly, as they watched Lenny take off and head towards the jump.   What do you mean? Ben asked as he stared at Lenny flying into the air.  She did a corked 180 backside, her body a swirl of color and skin, and landed gracefully.  The trick was flawless and the other riders applauded.   I am talking about Lenny.  Serge turned his pale, serious eyes on Ben.  You are not the one, do not waste your time.   Ben forced a laugh, embarrassed by the reprimand.   Whos The One, Serge? You? Ben asked, holding his mittened hands up to symbolize the air quotes.   No, Serge answered and bent down to tighten his bindings for his own run.  Not me.  Not you.   Ben watched Serge follow Lenny with an equally impressive run.  He was befuddled by Serges comments.  Did Lenny say something to Serge? As far as Ben knew, she was fair game.  She wasnt seeing anyone and neither was he.  Flirting couldnt hurt, right? Bens gaze drifted to Shane Brookings who was also watching Lenny.  Theyd been friendly with each other all day.  That didnt mean there was something going on there, did it? Surely Im better than that guy! Ben thought defensively.  Shane was a moron.  Lenny had to have better taste than that.  She wouldnt want to be with someone who was a known womanizer, would she?       21    No Way Back      Sways solution involved a lot of ass chewing, Luke found out very quickly.  He had called the guys and with quite a bit of coercing and slight extortion, Sway got them to agree to meet at Blakes loft.   It was like an intervention, Luke noted.  His closest friends were there, along with Carl and Harrisons sister, Miranda.  It was similar to when they had all confronted Mike on his drug use.   They sat Luke down on the couch and proceeded to tell him all the things he had done wrong and how it had affected their lives.  It would have been comical if wasnt so tragic.  Luke had been so wrapped up in his feelings for Lenny he never stopped to realize that she was very much a part of the rest of the band.  She had been woven into their hearts and music.   How one girl could have such a lasting impact on one band was beyond Lukes reasoning.  He knew how she had affected him, but he was in love with her.  He was finding out the others loved her as well, but in different ways.  She had become equally important and vital to them.  They missed her and they wanted her back.  And now this thing with the tabloids  Youre an idiot, Blake said disdainfully.   Remember, Blake, Miranda quietly reminded, Use feeling words.  I feel  I feel that you are an idiot, Blake restated in exasperation.   Miranda closed her eyes and sighed.   Its okay, Ran, Luke said, Blakes right, I am an idiot.   So what are you gonna do about it? Blake asked pointedly.   Well, I was hoping youd help me.  Luke looked around the room at his friends, settling on Sway.  Sway nodded and took over.   We are going to help him.  He started, giving stern looks to the eye rolls.  Luke has helped us all out of terrible things.  This is simply an opportunity for us to return the favor.   What do you have in mind? Mike hadn't stopped glaring at Luke since he'd arrived and Luke didn't blame him.  Mike had tried to help him and Luke had slammed the door in his face.  I'm an asshole.   You know that song you wrote for Lenny? Sway focused on Luke again and he nodded.   Were gonna record it and release it.  Right away.   The room was silent.   How does that help? Luke finally asked, feeling unsure.  But not listening to his friends hadn't gotten him very far.   Shell hear it and itll soften her heart.  Sway rolled his eyes at Luke's absurdity and kept going.  And then you gotta go to Jackson Hole and beg her to forgive you for being a complete douche bag.  You bring the biggest diamond you can find and you get down on one knee-  One knee? People still do that? Miranda interrupted.   Get down on one knee, Sway continued, throwing a scowl in Mirandas direction.  And you ask her to marry you.   You really think he can sing her a little song and shes just gonna forget Skank-Gate and promise to love him forever? Harrison had been relatively quiet during the whole event.  Until now.  He stood and grabbed his hair in both hands.   You have pictures of you playing Who Can Be The Whoriest with a random floozy circulating through the general populous! Am I the only one who has noticed this? Harrisons voice continued to raise.  Lenny was supposed to be your soul mate! What the hell were you doing with other girls at all?!  Luke swallowed and hung his head.  He didnt have any words with which to defend himself anymore.  He knew Harrison was right.  And he didnt deserve Lennys forgiveness let alone a second chance.   I agree with Harrison.  Carl's gruff voice joined in.  Lenny is smart, and she's too good for you.  He shrugged and leaned back in his seat, his peace having been said.   The room fell quiet again as everyone stared at Luke.  They all knew he had seriously screwed up big this time.  Lenny was smart, she wasnt going to let some guy treat her like a cheap novelty item and be okay with it.   Luke felt the hopelessness of the situation pulling his insides apart.  It couldn't end like this! He had loved her with truth and passion and fury, how could it end with a kiss goodbye at the airport? No fight? No conviction? No effort?  Lukes anger rose to the surface and he bolted to a standing position, making everyone around him jump.   No, he said forcefully, It doesnt end like this.  Not yet.  She might not want me but I still want her.  And she needs to know that.  He turned to Sway, Get the studio, tonight if you can.  Sway nodded and pulled out his phone.  Luke pointed at Harrison.  Dont stop pointing out what a dick Ive been.  He pointed at Blake and Mike next.  You guys can both punch me if you want.   Mike gave him a small smile and uncrossed his arms, Im just glad youre gonna fight for her.   Me too, Blake concurred.   Luke finally had the conviction he needed to fight for her and it might be too late.  This plan might not work but he was willing to try anything at this point.  He needed her more than he needed to feel sorry for himself.             The song turned out as good as it could for the rush they put on it.  The label agreed to release it immediately with no questions asked.  Luke was hoping the song would reach Lenny before the photos.  She was never one for reading tabloids but that didnt matter.  It would be all over TV soon enough.  Luke called his manager and told him to set up a few interviews for the next couple of days.  Hed try to get out in front of it as soon as possible.   The interviews went as expected.  They showed the illicit photos and Luke tried to make it sound like it wasnt as bad as they made it out to be.  He attempted to avoid using the phrase, we were on a break, but it came out a time or two.  Mostly he tried to focus on the single and how much it meant to him and how in love he was with the person he wrote it for.  They asked if it was for Lenny and he would neither confirm nor deny.  Again, the hope being that Lenny would hear the words and not see the pictures.   Then he flew to Jackson Hole.  He wasnt sure what hed say when he got there.  He just knew that he didnt want to say it over the phone.   The flight seemed to take forever.  He rented a car and drove to the Lodge, parking in the empty driveway.  He tried to still his flipping stomach as he approached the front door.  What if she was angry to see him? What if she was with someone else? What if she was with Duke? He took a deep breath and rang the doorbell.   After a few minutes without an answer, he rang it again.  Still nothing.  No one was home.  Luke looked up at the overcast sky.  Maybe she was on a ride.  Shed probably be back by dark.  Luke got back in his rental and decided to wait.             Luke woke up, startled.  Someone was knocking on his window.  He must have dozed off.  It was dark outside, he wasn't sure how long hed been waiting.  He opened his car door to find Duke frowning down at him.   What are you doing here, Casey? Duke greeted roughly.   Luke climbed out of the car and tried to look evenly into the taller mans eyes.  I came to see Lenny, he answered as confidently as possible.   Shes not here, Duke replied flatly.  Luke saw a flicker of something in his eyes he couldnt place.  Either Duke was glad to see him or he was going to punch him in the nose.   When will she be back? Luke refused to be intimidated.   Dukes jaw worked under his skin before he finally relented and gestured for Luke to come into the house.   When he walked into the warmth of the Lodge, he noticed how empty it felt.   She left.  Duke said as he hung up his coat and proceeded to the kitchen.   What do you mean, she left? Luke followed, feeling his world crash around him.  He'd waited too long.   I mean, you didnt call and she went to Alaska.  Duke took out some milk and poured two glasses, offering one to Luke.  Shes not here.  Shes gone.   When is she coming back? Lukes memory banks fired and he vaguely remembered having a conversation with Lenny that she was in Alaska.  But he hadnt been sure if that memory was real or just a dream.   Dont know.  Duke took a drink of milk.  You shouldve called.   I know, Luke responded, feeling more defeated than he had all week.  She was even further away now.   Where in Alaska? Luke suddenly asked.  Why not? He had the money and the time.  Why couldnt he just go there? It didnt matter where they were when he told he loved her, she just needed to hear it.   Valdez.  With a bunch of other people.  Duke's face was unreadable.  He was obviously just as pissed at Luke as the rest of them.   Luke thought for a few minutes before speaking again.  I don't know what to do.  I'm so backwards and turned around without her.  I love that woman with everything I have.  I can't stop trying until I'm positive she knows that.   Duke nodded once and tried to hide his smile behind another drink of milk.  This might be salvageable after all, Casey.             It had been an amazing week.  Getting up early, fresh rides all day long with the best in the sport, Lenny couldnt ask for more.  Shed hardly had time to think about Luke, much less be surprised when he didnt call her back.  He had been very drunk.  Hed probably forgotten the whole conversation.  It was just as well, Lenny thought, they should give each other some space to move on.  As impossible as that seemed.   The snow had started to come down in thick waves sometime in the middle of the night.  Nick met everyone in the Lodge the next morning and explained that the current storm system moving through might last a couple days.  His words were met with groans and complaints.  But nothing could be done.  They had to wait out the weather and then theyd be able to tackle the mountains again.   The first day of the storm, everyone gravitated to the Lodge and played pool or watched TV.  It wasnt so bad.  The group was growing closer and more tight-knit and the age gaps werent as apparent anymore.  But by day two, people were going a little stir crazy.   Lenny was watching a very dodgy game of darts between Ben and Trucker when Shane took a seat next to her on the couch.   I was wondering if we could talk? He asked gently.   Lenny turned sideways to face him.  They were relatively alone.  The Lodge was buzzing but no one was close enough to overhear a casual conversation.   Sure, she answered sincerely.  She and Shane had gotten along better during this trip than they had the entire time theyd known each other.  The awkward tenseness that she had expected was nonexistent.  He had been nothing but friendly and encouraging.  It was as if their ugly breakup and following confrontation a few weeks ago had never happened.   I guess, I just wanted you to know how sorry I am.  Shanes amber eyes were pulled down at the sides in regret, taking Lenny off guard.  I feel terrible about what I did to you.  You were always so amazing to me and I really hurt you.   Lenny had no idea Shane had wanted to have such a serious conversation.  It was as good a time as any, Lenny supposed.  She had a few things shed been wanting to clear up herself.   Why did you stick around for so long after the accident? You couldve just moved on.  She searched his eyes as he looked back, unblinking.   Because I was really hoping maybe you did forget what Cody and I had done and we could pick where we left off.   But there were other girls, Shanenot just Cody.  Lenny reminded.  Her previous anger had evaporated weeks, ago.  It had been replaced with acceptance and curiosity.   Yeah, I was a horrible boyfriend.  Shane acknowledged.  He looked at her earnestly.  But, I think I did love you, as much I was capable of at the time.   What does that mean? Lenny asked, her eyebrows pulling together.   I didnt love you like you deserved.  Shanes eyes were serious and sad.  But I learned a lot from losing you.  And I hope, someday, I can be your friend again.   Lenny studied his face, he had gotten older when she wasn't looking.  She had known Shane for a long time.  They had a history, not a great one, but it was there nonetheless.  She had never seen him more genuine and her heart changed in that moment.  She decided to let go of the past.   I forgive you, Shane.  She reached over and laid her hand on his forearm.  He looked up at her, relief creeping into his gaze.   I didnt ask you to, he responded softly, his voice full of hope and wonder.   No, but we both needed me to.  Lenny gave him a crooked smile and moved to sit closer to him on the couch.  He hesitantly put an around around her shoulders as she hugged up next to him.   Thank you, Lenny.  He rested his chin on the top of her head and she smiled.  They couldn't go back and fix everything, and they would never be more than friends.  But at least they could be friends and that meant more to Lenny than she had realized.   She glanced over as Nick sat down nearby and started a conversation with those at the bar.   The storm is actually getting worse.  Lenny overheard Nick telling Smitty and Serge.  We may have to move the kids into town till it passes.   And thats exactly what happened.  Nick announced a few hours later to pack up what they needed and they piled into a caravan of cars and trucks and headed to a hotel in Valdez.             The hotel was nearly empty from other travelers and the group all got their own rooms on the same floor.  It was almost like a college dorm, Lenny thought ruefully.  Hopefully they would all behave themselves.  Snowboarders forced to stay indoors due to inclement weather? Probably not.   She decided to explore downtown Valdez and took Ben, Shane, Shelby Lynn and Travis in tow.  They went in and out of little shops and stores, sometimes buying trinkets for family back home.  They ate at a small restaurant that served fresh fish and lobster caught in the Sound.   They were walking back to the hotel when Travis pulled the groups attention to a small music store.  They entered and casually browsed the various merchandise.  CDs, vinyls, t-shirts, posters; every band imaginable.  Lenny was flipping through a stack of old records when a familiar song started to play on the speakers overhead.   She froze, listening to the first few notes on the guitar carefully, it couldnt becould it? Then a low, gravelly voice started in with the lyrics she knew by heart.  It was her song.  The song Luke had written for her.  It sounded a little different, the whole band was playing, it was no longer acoustic.  Lenny swallowed hard and looked around for the stores clerk.  Spotting him near the register she slowly made her way that direction, trying to not draw any attention to herself.   Excuse me, she flashed her most persuasive smile.  The pudgy, curly haired clerk straightened up as she spoke.  I was wondering what the name of the track is that you're playing right now.   Ohuh, he held up a case, Its Double Blind Studys new single, Need.  Just got it today.  He handed the case over to Lenny for her to examine.   She carefully took the plastic case and turned it over, her hands shaking.  It was a stock photo of the band, nothing she hadnt seen a million times.   Its weird, right? The clerk said with a laugh.   What do you mean? Lenny looked up at him with a soft frown.   Well, just that guy, he pointed to Luke on the cover.  He writes this song for his girl and then goes off and cheats on her.   What are you talking about? Lenny felt a hollowness in the pit of her stomach.   The clerk pulled a tabloid out from under the counter and opened it to the pictures of Luke making out with a random girl.  Lenny couldnt help but stare.  She felt someone come up behind her but she didnt acknowledge them.   I wonder if its a ploy to get more publicity, the clerk continued.  Hes been all over TV and radio this week pushing their single and downplaying these tabloid pictures.   Lenny was skimming the article for any mention of her.  She knew she shouldnt.  She felt dirty for even looking at this piece of trash like it was a legitimate news report but she couldnt stop herself.  Yes, she was mentioned: Lenna Evans, former Olympian, humiliated by Caseys addiction to sex and booze, has been in hiding for weeks.  Well, that wasnt true.  Alaska was far away but she wasnt hiding.   In every interview hes all: This song is for the love of my life.  I mean every word, blah, blah, blah.  The clerk was enjoying his own Luke impersonation.   Cmon, Lenny, a strong voice said from next to her.  An equally strong arm hooked around her waist and pulled her towards the door.  We have to get back.  Shane addressed the clerk, Thanks, man.  You got cool stuff here.   Lenny felt numb as she walked back to the hotel next to Shane.  Her head was swirling with the pictures from the tabloid of the girl on Lukes lap with her tongue down his throat.  Her hands had been twisted in his hair. . . the same way Lenny used to twist her fingers in it.   She felt knifed, gutted, a sinkhole where here faith had been.  It was so much more than what she had felt the night she had walked in on Cody and Shane.  She had been forgotten.   She wasn't sure how she made it all the way to her room and got her key out of her back pocket.             Shane took the key from her and opened the door, helping Lenny inside.  He gave a reassuring look to the rest of the group who had been watching with worried faces.   Well see you guys downstairs for dinner.  And he went inside Lennys room with her.   She was rummaging through her luggage for some clean clothes.  Having gone from lifeless to angry in the millisecond he wasn't looking.   You okay? He asked apprehensively.   Sure! Why wouldnt I be okay? Lenny snapped, throwing her clothes on the floor and rifling through them again.   Im not sure what to say, except Im sorry.  Shane tried to offer comfort.   Thats rich, coming from you! She scoffed openly.  I have great taste in men, dont I? I guess its true, you all want the same thing.  I didn't put out so he replaced me.   Shane frowned, about to protest.  He wasnt sure exactly what to say.  She had a right to be angry, especially with him.  Lenny suddenly took off her shirt and flung it to the floor.  She kicked out of her jeans and slid on a pair of shorts.  Shane stared for a second before he averted his eyes.  She grabbed her running shoes and quickly laced them up.   In only her sports bra and running shorts, Lenny headed to the fitness center downstairs.  Shane followed, unsure of what else to do.  Lenny let herself into the weight room and immediately started her old routine; heavy weights, heavy squats, heavy presses.  Shane recognized it right away.  It was part of her physical rehab after her accident.  But she was lifting way heavier than she had before.  She was clearly going for complete muscle fatigue.   Its a good song, Shane wasnt sure why he felt the need to defend Luke.  Probably because the guy wasnt there to defend himself.   Its a great song, Lenny grunted, Stupid me for thinking it was about me.   How do you know its not about you? Shane countered, knowing he was walking a line that might end up with him getting smacked.   Oh please.  Its just another way to make money.  If it was special, it would have stayed special and not been sold.  She dropped her dumbbells with a thud.  Its fine.  Were not together.  He can screw whatever tramp he wants.   Shane watched her sweat for a few minutes and then decided it was best to leave Lenny alone.  He didnt go far.  He sat out in the lobby with one eye on the door and the other on the TV.  Maybe Luke Casey would make an appearance on ET or something and fill in some of the blanks.   Shane had been sitting in the same chair for almost two hours when Nick joined him.   She still in there? Nick asked, having been filled in on the basics by a very concerned Shelby Lynn.   Yep.  Shane sighed and tossed down the magazine hed been reading.  She lifted for nearly an hour and now shes running on the treadmill.   You try talking to her? Nick asked.   Sort of.  Didnt go well.  Im a little afraid, not gonna lie.  Shane pursed his lips.   Nick sighed heavily and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger.   I called Dukethis is gonna get worse before it gets better.  Nick spoke slowly, like he was afraid of the next few words he had to say.   Shane narrowed his eyes at him.  What do you mean?  Lukes on his way here.  His plane landed hours ago and I already checkedhes booked at this hotel.        22    Victorian Machinery      Lennys skin was dripping with sweat.  Her face was contorted and pinched as she pushed the maximum speed and incline on the treadmill.  Her hair had almost completely broken free of the restraint and stuck in thick, sweaty tendrils to her bare shoulders and back.  Salty streams ran into her face, blurring her vision and stinging her eyes.  She didnt even bother wiping it away.  Her lungs burned and her legs were on fire but she pushed on.  She had to keep going.  At least until she was numb and couldnt feel the hurt that was buried deep inside her.   It wasnt fair.  Every muscle fiber in her was screaming, trying to break free from the feelings that threatened to overtake her.  She had done the right thing.  She had to call it quits with Luke.  One of them had to make the sacrifice.  One of them had to be the grownup and see their situation for what it really was.  Her breathing intensified with her thoughts.  If she would have stayed, it could have only ended badly.  He would have resented her for changing his life around and she couldnt bear the thought of him looking at her with regret in his eyes.   She felt the sweat running in rivers between her shoulder blades.  She breathed heavy out of her mouth, sending sweat spewing onto the display of the treadmill.  She shouldve known better.  She should have protected herself and never gotten involved with him.  This was her fault.  He hadnt done anything wrong.  It was his job to write songs that squeezed the soul of the listener.  She shouldnt have let herself think she was special.  She was a temporary muse.  A convenient inspiration.  And now that she was out of the picture he was free to do whatever with whomever he chose.  Isn't that exactly what Ashton had told her? She was replaceable.   The hollow pit in Lennys stomach tightened as the pictures flashed in her mind again.  This would be a lot easier for her to handle if she didnt have to remember every single thing in perfect detail.  Her photographic memory was hell at times.  This being one of them.  Those images would never leave her mind.  Just like she would never forget the things Shane and Cody had said to her.  The same way she remembered the accident in vibrant color with all the special effects.  It wasnt fair.  No one should have to carry a burden so heavy; to see the one man she had ever loved in the arms of a random woman.   Shane reentered the fitness room and took a seat on the weight bench.  He clasped a towel in his hands on his lap and patiently waited.  Lenny glanced at him and saw that he wasnt going to leave until he talked to her.  She jumped to the sides of the treadmill and shut it off.  Shane tossed her the towel and she wiped the sweat off her face.   Feel better? Shane asked, his face and voice tense.   No, Lenny shot back.  She walked over and stood in front of him.  Shed pretty much had enough of everyones bullshit.   What do you want, Shane? She confronted contentiously.   Nothing.  Shane remained tactful, Just want to make sure youre okay.   Im awesome.  Lenny said sarcastically and strode to the door.  Shane hurriedly got up to follow her.   I dont need a babysitter, Shane.  Lenny snapped.  What she needed was this stupid storm to clear and a high vertical.   She felt Shane's large body pressing too close and turned around to tell him to back off when she stopped in her tracks.  Her eyes narrowed as a familiar shape came through the front doors and approached the desk.  Shed recognize that saunter anywhere.   Without thinking, she marched in that direction; Shane hot on her heels.  He was saying something to her but she wasnt listening.  All her thoughts and the adrenaline from her intense workout drowned him out.  Hell hath no fury, right?  What the hell are you doing here? Lenny confronted Luke.  She crossed her arms over her chest and glared deeply at him.  She had controlled her voice to keep from shouting but there was no mistaking the edge in her words.             Luke was shocked to see Lenny at the hotel.  He thought hed have to drive inland when the storm cleared.  It had been difficult enough just getting from the airport to Valdez in the blizzard.  He was tired and discouraged and he wasnt prepared to see Lenny.  Especially with the fury with which she was greeting him.   Her face was flushed and her hair was soaked, she was only wearing a sports bra and tiny running shorts.  Her perfect skin ran with rivers of sweat, twisting and bending over her lean muscles.  She would have looked completely gorgeous if she wasnt staring daggers at him.  Luke tried to overlook Shane taking a protective stance behind Lenny.  What the hell is he doing here?  Im here to see you.  Was all Luke could think of to say.  Somehow professing his idiocy and undying love seemed inappropriate in the midst of her obvious ire.   Lennys eyes flicked over to the receptionist and then back to Luke.  She was trying to decide if this was, in fact, where she wanted to have the fight that was coming.  She decided against it, turned abruptly on her heel and stormed to the elevators.   Luke grabbed his room key off the desk and picked up his bag, hurrying after her.   Can we talk? he asked her when they got to the lift.  He ignored Shanes warning looks.   Lennys eyes were severe when she looked at him.  She didnt answer as she stepped inside the lift, Luke and Shane following.   The ride to her floor was silent and Luke wasnt sure what to do next.  When the doors opened and she charged to her room, he had no choice but to pursue her.   She unlocked her door and let herself in, slamming it in Lukes face.  He sighed and knocked.   Lennyplease, can we talk? He asked through the thick wood.   After a few moments without an answer, Shane touched Lukes shoulder.   Maybe give her a few minutes.  Shes pretty pissed at you right now.   Luke frowned at him.  When did I switch places with Shane? Doesnt Lenny hate this guy? Luke swallowed the words that wanted to lash out at Shane and took his key card from his pocket.  He walked down the hall a few paces to his room that happened to be right next to Lennys, he noticed wryly.  He dumped his bags and his coat and went back to Lennys door.   Shane was still standing outside of it like some sort of bodyguard and Luke felt his anger at the situation growing.  This was not part of the plan.  He needed to talk to Lenny, and having this gargoyle watching his every move wasnt helping.   He knocked on the door again.   Lenny, please.  Luke tried to reduce the frustration in his voice.  Can we talk?  Some doors down the hall opened and the rest of Lenny and Shanes group peaked their heads out in curiosity.  Luke was positive they had all heard the rumors about their wild love affair during his last tour.  Most of them had probably been filled in on the tabloid pictures and the recent song release.  And they had all, more than likely, formed their own conclusions.  Luke wasnt the good guy in any of them.  They knew Lenny, of course they would be on her side.  But that didnt mean they couldnt gawk at the rock star.   Luke looked uncomfortably at the small audience that was gathering twenty or so paces down the hall.  He knocked on the door again.   Cmon, Lenny.  He tried to plead again.  Can we please talk?  The door suddenly flew open.  Lenny backed Luke up into the hallway.  Her jaw clenched and her mouth formed in a hard line.   Sure.  Lets talk.  Lenny crossed her arms over her chest.  Who is she?  What? Lukes eyebrows pulled together.   The tart checking the depth of your throat with her tongue! Lenny took a step towards him and he backed up again.   Shes notIuh Luke had never been on the receiving end of Lennys fury.  He was at a loss for what to do.   Wow.  Realization hit Lenny.  You dont even know her name, do you? The onlookers let out a collective gasp.   Did you hear your song? Luke was flailing and he grabbed at his only defense.   Oh, the song you said you wrote for me but then sold? Lenny stretched her hands out to the sides and let them fall, slapping against her thighs.  You run out of ideas? Is that why youre here? You need me to help you find that next hit? She took on an aggressive stance and put her hands on her hips.  What, hard up for cash after the tour? Being a philanderer must get expensive fast! Her voice dripped with sarcasm.   Hey! Luke had about had enough.  He pointed to his chest with both hands.  How do you think I felt when you left?! I was lonely and I missed you and Im sorry about the girl, it just happened!  Really? You were minding your own business and she tripped and fell and you caught her with your tongue? Lenny yelled.   You LEFT! Luke shouted, taking a step forward and leveling a finger at her face.  He knew he wasnt helping the situation but he couldnt stop himself.  He was still angry with her for walking away.  Besides, how do you think I feel when I get here and youre with him? Luke pointed at Shane.  Is he helping keep your bed warm in Alaska?  Luke knew he had crossed a line.  He regretted it the moment he said it.  The hurt and anger in Lennys eyes tore through him.  Before Luke could take it back, Lennys hand flew to his face making a loud smack that was followed by silence.   He stared at her in shock.  Luke had never been slapped before.  His cheek stung with the heat from her hand.  Lennys eyes glossed over with tears and Luke instinctively reached for her but Shane, misreading Lukes intentions, stepped in between them.  Lenny spun and retreated, slamming the door to her room.   Shanes eyes bored holes into Lukes.  Luke tried to step past him but Shane stood firm, his powerful body rigid.             Alright, everyone.  Serges calming voice cut through the tension.  The show is over, it is time to get downstairs for dinner.  He herded the wide-eyed onlookers towards the elevators.  Luke and Shane stood toe to toe, neither one of them moving.   Serge and Nick sent the elevator on its way and approached the testosterone fueled standoff.   This is needless, Serge reproved them.  Shane, you should come downstairs with me.   Im not leaving him alone with her, Shane seethed.   I would never hurt her, Luke responded in kind.   You already have, Shane took a step forward.   So have you, Luke reminded, closing the gap between them.   This isnt a pissing contest! Nick snapped, pushing the two men apart.  He narrowed his eyes at Luke.  You need to give her some time.  Why dont you cool off and get something to eat with us?  No, thank you, Luke growled.  He backed up and sat down with his back against the wall, facing Lennys door.   Nick sighed and grabbed Shane by the arm.   Lets go.  He pulled Shane toward the elevator but not before Shane gave Luke one final, threatening scowl.             A heavy silence descended over Luke as he waited in the hallway.  He rested his arms on his bent knees and leaned his head against the wall.  This was the last thing he had expected.  He had thought that she might be a little mad, maybe hurt.  Mostly he was hoping she would be happy to see him.  Hed come so far just to have the door slammed in his face.  Twice.  And why was Shane being all possessive? Were they back together?  Luke rubbed the hot skin on his face where she had slapped him.  He knew better than that.  Lenny wasnt sleeping with Shane.  It wasnt in her character.  Of course, she probably had believed the same thing about him and look how he had treated that belief.   The only thing that had been on his mind on his entire journey here was telling her he loved her.  Instead, he had yelled at her and pushed her even further away.             After Lenny had slammed the door she retreated to the bathroom.  Her hand stung from where she had struck Lukes face.  She looked at herself in the mirror and noticed the tears that were spilling down her cheeks.  She wiped them away angrily and turned the shower on.   The hot water poured down her back and Lenny gave way to heaving sobs.  She leaned against the wall of the shower and cried.  How could he be here? Why? What purpose did it serve for him to torture her up close? Couldnt he let her suffer from a distance? Everything about this was wrong.  Completely and totally wrong.  On one hand, she wanted to push him down a flight of stairs, along with the tramp from the photos.  And on the otherall she wanted was to have him fold his perfect arms around her and believe that they could start over and none of that other stuff mattered.   Lenny slammed her fists against the shower wall in frustration.  She was still going to have to deal with this.  Slapping his face and slamming the door were only minor interruptions in the fight they were in the middle of.  It would take a lot more than that for this to get solved.  But Lenny didnt want to.  She wanted to go back to a few days ago, when the powder was perfect and Shelby Lynn had called her Snow Goddess.  When she was so busy with living her life that her heart had, albeit briefly, stopped aching for a minute.  How could the presence of one person completely turn her world upside down?  She somehow managed to wash her hair and scrub herself clean.  The tears abated for the moment and Lenny wrapped a towel around herself.  She stealthily crept to the door and looked out the peep hole.   Predictably, Luke was sitting just outside, facing her door.  Lenny dug through the pile of clothes she had dumped out on the floor earlier for some sweats and a shirt.  Nothing was particularly clean or attractive and she decided on a pair of gray, lumpy sweats and an old college sweatshirt that she had borrowed from Scott years ago.   She slowly combed out her long, wet hair and thought about what to do next.  She could let Luke in and the fight would probably start again.  Maybe even causing them to get kicked out.  Or she could go to bed and hope that hed get the hint and fly back to wherever he had come from.  The last thought scared her more than the first.  She didnt want him there but the idea of him leaving the way things were made her want to panic.   She should go out there and talk to him.  She knew it inside but it was difficult to figure out what to say.  She had said everything she needed to when she had left the airport.  Why did it feel like they were still connected? Shouldnt it be over? But no, she could feel him from the other side of the door, waiting for her.   The rigorous workout that Lenny had subjected her body to hours before was catching up with her.  So was the emotional stress of Lukes presence.  Lenny curled into a ball on her bed and tried to focus on her breathing.  The fatigue took over and she fell into a dreamless sleep.             The others came back from dinner and a hush fell over the group as they stepped over Lukes rumpled form in the hallway.  He didnt even look up at them.  Nick ushered them to their rooms and told them to turn in early.  They didnt need convincing.   Shane waited in his room long enough for the others to think hed gone to bed and then he stepped into the hallway.  He paused, waiting to see if Luke would notice his presence.  If he did, it wasnt obvious.  Luke was more exhausted then Shane had first noticed.  His clothes were wrinkled and unwashed.  His eyes were sunk in and dark from days, possibly weeks, without sleep.  He hadnt shaved either.  Shane wondered when he had eaten last.   He made his way slowly towards the singer and took a seat next to him on the floor.   I dont want to fight with you, Brookings.  Luke said roughly.  His eyes heavy with fatigue and discouragement.   Thats not why Im here.  Shane answered flatly.  He clenched his jaw.  Being a dick was so much easier, but Shane wanted to be a better person.  How he hated himself right now.   They sat in silence for a while, the ice maker down the hall and a movie with explosions in the room behind them, the only noise.   She hasnt slept with me.  Shane said, his voice echoing in the silence.  He felt an indescribable need to defend Lennys honor.  Maybe because he had been the one to ruin her in the past, it would be a way of making amends.  Shane wasnt sure.  He didnt particularly like Luke Casey but he knew Lenny cared for him.  And that was important to Shane.   I know, Luke sighed in frustration.   Then, why did you? Shanes voice trailed off.   I was mad.  And I still dont know why youre here.  Luke threw a small glare in Shanes direction.   Shane shrugged.  Luke had a point.  It did look suspicious at first glance.   Im not after your girl, Shane declared.   Luke hmphed and leaned his head back, looking up at the ceiling.  What makes you think shes still my girl? He asked the ceiling more than Shane.   Shane considered his words carefully before saying them.  Ive known Lenny a long time, he began slowly, And shes never slapped anyone.  Kicked the crap out a couple of guys and has definitely thrown some punches but never slapped.   And that helps me how? Luke let out a disgruntled chuckle.   I thinkyou have to care really deeply for someone to let them get to you that much.  Shane shook his head and looked into his lap.  She never even fought with me.   Luke frowned and looked over at Shane.  Never?  Nope.  Shed just shut herself off or leave town for a while.  I guess I always knew I wasnt worth her time.   So, youre saying the slap is a good thing? Luke asked skeptically.   Yeah, thats what Im saying.  Shanes serious face cracked a smile.  But thats Lenny for ya, when she loves, she goes all in.             Luke swallowed hard.  He missed her.  He wanted to start pounding on her door and demand to work this out.  But he thought she might be sleeping and he didnt want to disturb her.  She had looked so tired.   Did you really get a tattoo of her name on your arm? Luke suddenly asked.   Ha, yeah.  You wanna see it? Shane pulled up his sleeve to reveal his perfectly sculpted bicep and a simple script:  Free Bird  Why did you do that? Luke asked.   What can I say, Im a lifelong fan.  Shane shrugged and smiled, lowering his sleeve.   Get some sleep, man.  Shane started to stand up.  If this storm breaks tomorrow, shes gonna head for the highest peak.  He raised an eyebrow, You ready to chase her?  Luke gave a crooked grin through his weariness as an answer.  Ill think Ill sleep out herejust in case.   Shane nodded and headed back to his room.  He grabbed a couple of the extra pillows and a blanket and brought it to Luke in the hallway.   Luke nodded his thanks and Shane left it at that.  He hoped that Luke could put things right.  He wasnt a bad guy, hed just made some piss poor choices.  Shane had been there.  But Lenny had forgiven Shane, so she would probably forgive Luke as well.  Hopefully, sooner rather than later.  Those two belonged together.        23    Get Around This      Lennys growling stomach is what woke her up.  She was starving.  Her first thought was for pancakes.  Her second thought was Luke.   She crept to the door to look out the peep hole and held her breath.  What if he wasnt there? What if he had left while things were still ugly between them? Lenny let the air out of her lungs as she observed Lukes slumped over figure in the hallway.   He looked pitiful.  Hed tried to stay propped up but had nodded off sometime in the night and was slouched, painfully crooked.  Lennys heart squeezed inside of her chest.  What kind of a man would sleep outside of the door of the girl who had publicly chastised him and then slapped him?  Luke Casey was that kind of man.   Lenny went to the bathroom and rushed through her routine.  She shook her head to herself as she contemplated what her next move should be.  She couldnt see a way out of talking to him.  He obviously wasnt going to leave until she did.  She brushed her teeth and pulled her silky hair into a loose ponytail at the nape of her neck.  She looked down at her pajamas and decided she didnt want look like a total mess.   She tried to find something clean to wear amongst her pile of dirty clothing.  Settling on some well-worn jeans and her black, lace-back riding tank, Lenny quickly changed.  She slipped on some thick socks and laced up her boots.  She grabbed a black and white flannel from off the floor and shoved her arms through the sleeves, not bothering to button it up.   She closed her eyes to steady her breathing before opening the door.  She pulled it open quietly and slowly stepped into the hall.  Luke didnt stir.  She looked up and down the hall but didnt hear any other activity aside from the small click of her door closing behind her.  It was still early, the rest of the group would probably be asleep for at least another hour.   Lenny looked down at Luke and noticed his appearance for the first time.  She had been so upset with him the night before that she didnt see the circles and puffiness under his eyes.  But he was still as handsome as she remembered, his long hair nearly to his shoulders and partially covering his face. .  She knelt down next to him and readjusted his pillow.   Lukes eyes opened slightly and then closed again.  Lenny gently touched his face, brushing his hair away.  His eyes opened again and fixed on her.  Lenny smiled slightly as his brain caught up with his vision.   Lenny? His voice croaked.   What are you doing sleeping in the hallway? She asked softly.   Luke pushed himself into a sitting position and tried to reorient himself.  He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and looked at his surroundings.  His vision came to rest on Lenny and he looked her up and down, finally settling on her face.   She tried to work the moisture back into her mouth, suddenly at a loss for words under the scrutiny of his crystal blue eyes.  Her anger from the previous evening momentarily forgotten in his larger than life presence.   You wanna get some breakfast? She couldnt think of anything else to say.  She knew they needed to talk but she didnt know where to start and she didnt want to be in the hallway when the others started to rise from their comas.   Luke nodded once and got into a standing position.  He gathered his pillows and blanket and silently deposited them in his room.  He disappeared for a few minutes, leaving Lenny in the hallway.  Just when she was afraid he wasnt coming back, he reemerged, his face washed and breath fresh.  His eyes brightened when he looked at her, or did she imagine that?  They didnt speak as they got on the elevator and walked to the small caf that was part of the hotel.  The hostess seated them and they sat silently, staring at their menus.  Lenny couldnt help but feel incredibly awkward.  Maybe this was a bad idea.  She looked sideways out the windows and silently cursed the continuing blizzard.  She wanted nothing more than to run out into the swirling snow and disappear from the uncomfortable conversation they had yet to begin.   The waitress came and got their order and then left them to sit in their silence again.  Luke shifted in his seat and finally leaned against the table, putting his elbows on the top and resting his chin in his hands.   I'm sorry about the thing with the girl in the bar.  It was stupid and I have no excuse.  His normally smiling eyes were tired and forlorn.   Luke- Lenny started, closing her eyes.  Not anticipating the pain that would accompany the strangeness of his apology.   I don't have a right to ask for anymore chances or even for forgiveness.  He slid his hand across the table and tentatively touched the top of her fingertips.   Lenny sighed heavily.  He didn't understand, how could he?  I'm also sorry about releasing your song.  You were right.  It was special, I should have kept it special.  Lukes mouth turned up on one side slightly.  Thats what I get for listening to Sway.   You took relationship advice from Sway? Lenny asked, aghast.   He has a girlfriend now, Luke defended.   No way.  Lenny smiled suddenly and Luke grinned in response.  I miss those guys, she added quietly.   Then come back, Luke pleaded frankly.   Luke, you know that wouldnt be a good idea.  Lenny swallowed the lump that rose in her throat.  He wasnt going to make this easy on her, was he?  Why? Luke asked, covering her hand with his.  Were great together.  Why is this such a bad idea?  Lennys skin awakened when his hand grabbed hers and she got mad at herself inwardly for having such a reaction.  If she was going to explain this to him than she need to keep her wits about her.   Did you not notice the epic fight we had last night? Lenny looked at him earnestly.  Being on tour put us in a kind of bubble.  It protected us from reality.  When I first left, I thought that maybe I was making a mistake because I missed you so bad but. . .  she looked out the window and shook her head.  Seeing you in those pictures hurt more than I thought possible.  Our relationship doesnt translate into our regular lives.  She pulled her hand away from his and took a sip of water.  If you think about it, I think youll see it too.   Luke looked down at the table.  His shoulders slowly sagged into a defeated posture and Lenny thought that maybe she had reached him after all.  Maybe he could see what she could see.   Their food came and they ate silently.  Luke wouldnt look at her and Lenny felt like she was leaving him all over again.  Why had he come to Alaska? What purpose did this serve? He was obviously moving on back in Boston.  The pictures flashed into Lennys mind again and she visibly shuttered, getting Lukes attention.   Something wrong with your food? He asked, concerned.   No, Lenny took a drink of water, Just an unpleasant memory.   Luke nodded and went back to his meal.   Hey, guys.  Nick approached their table cautiously.   Nick, Lenny greeted and nodded at Luke, This is Luke Casey, Luke this is Nick Federa.  He runs the place up in Thompson Pass.   Yeah, we met briefly last night.  Nick offered his hand and Luke shook it.  The storm should clear out by today, Nick was addressing Lenny again, We should be able to go back to the cabins by tomorrow.   Nick must have noticed the tension at the table but he decided to add an invitation to Luke, Youre more than welcome to join us, if you want.   Luke probably wont be staying.  Lenny interjected before Luke could answer.   Nick shrugged and then moved to his own table where Smitty and Trucker were seated.   Are you asking me to leave? Luke asked, his voice rough.   Lenny looked up, seeing the rejection on his face and her heart sank.  I just thought, it might be weird for you to stay sinceyou know.   No, I dont know.  Lukes eyebrows pulled in tight.   Lenny mirrored his frown.  He was more stubborn that she had anticipated.  How could he not see the eminent devastation that was their relationship?  I just meant, you might want to get back home, thats all.   Luke lowered his glower to his plate of food and shoveled in the last few bites of omelet.  He swirled the coffee in his cup, took a drink, and looked up at Lenny again.  His face was resolved.   Im staying, he said simply.  Lennys mouth fell open but before she could protest, Luke stood up and pulled his wallet out of his back pocket.  He tossed a couple of twenties onto the table, more than enough for both of their breakfasts.   He pushed his face into her personal space, demanding eye contact.  This, he pointed between himself and Lenny, his voice a dark whisper, isnt over.  He held her eyes for a heartbeat longer than Lenny was comfortable with before he turned to leave.   Lenny watched his back in silent frustration.  Her face was warm from the intensity of Lukes final stare.  Why was he making this harder than it had to be? What could be solved by his staying here? What was he possibly thinking?            Luke had a plan.  It wasnt the best plan that hed ever made but he finally had one.  Lenny thought their relationship couldnt last in the real world.  She thought he didn't care for as much as he did.  His plan was to prove her wrong.  And the best way to do that would be to join her in her world.   Luke had been snowboarding recreationally since he was a kid.  He wasnt the best but he was better than most.  Duke had set him up with a bunch of gear before leaving Jackson Hole.  He had all the equipment he would need to join the other seasoned riders for the remaining week.  He just hoped it wouldnt take long for Lenny to figure out what he already had.  They were meant to be together.   He showered and dressed quickly, knowing he was going to have to permeate Lennys life in a way he never had before.  He had to learn about her friends and colleagues.  He had to dedicate himself to being her friend again.  And when she was ready, she would let her guard down and Luke would swoop in and steal her heart.   He was pulling his shirt over his head when he heard her come back from breakfast.  He grabbed his coat and went to her door and knocked.  He noticed her dumbfounded face when she opened the door.  She stood there awkwardly for a few minutes until he spoke.   Can I come in? He asked, trying to sound as platonic as possible.   I was just leaving, actually.  Lenny replied, eying him suspiciously.  I have to get some of these clothes washed before tomorrow.   Ill help you.  Luke stepped into her room, ignoring her annoyed look and grabbed the couple of laundry bags she had filled.  He turned to find her staring at him.   Lets go, he prompted.   Lenny hesitated before reluctantly opening the door to the hallway.  She grabbed her coat and slipped it on.  Luke did likewise and they traveled in complete silence from the hallway to the elevator and down the street to the laundry mat.             Lenny self-consciously sorted her clothes while Luke got change.  She hadnt brought anything too embarrassing with her.  Just the basics; jeans, t-shirts, underwear, socks, a couple sweaters and some flannels.   Luke came back and handed her a stack of quarters and she hurriedly started two loads at once.  The sooner this was over with the better.   As the washers began their cycles, Lenny took a seat and Luke joined her.  She was decidedly uneasy.  Lukes presence still had an overwhelming effect on her.  She felt calm, relaxed, giddy even but that was coupled with the fear, dread and paranoia that everything was about to go terribly wrong.             Luke could sense her tension and he got up and bought a couple of waters from the machine.  He handed one to her and took his seat again.   So, you get any good runs in since you been here? He tried to sound as casual as possible but his heart was racing.  Being in such close proximity to Lenny was like being trapped in an open space with a tornado bearing down on him.   Yeah, its been nonstop until this blasted storm.  Lenny gestured to the snow that was starting to taper off but still heavy.   Tell me about your favorite day.  Luke saw her eyes light up and he was happy that she was feeling a bit more lenient to opening up to him.   Luke paid attention to every detail.  He asked for specifics and tried to memorize all the people that Lenny was close to.  If he was going to gain her trust again, he was going to need to give it everything he had.   He loved listening to her voice and how, when she was really excited about something, her smile was permanently crooked, making her talk out of the side of her mouth.  Sometimes hed get distracted by the perfect shape of her lips and hed remember what it had been like to taste them.  Hed have to pull himself back into reality.  If he was ever going to get an opportunity like that again, he was going to have to earn it.             Luke helped Lenny switch her loads to the dryer.  She continued to tell him all about her week in Alaska.  She recounted everything in vivid detail, using her photographic memory to the best of its ability.  Sharing with Luke the adventure shed been on made it feel like he had been there with her.  And for a moment, fleeting though it was, Lenny forgot about the tabloid gossip and pictures.  She was simply sharing her life, turn by turn, with the one person she had wanted to be there all along.             Luke hung on her words.  Thankful for the time he could spend with her.  At first, he had been jealous of the others who had gotten to share in the actual events of the week but her memory was so perfect and clear, he knew she wasnt leaving anything out.  He had noticed this about her memory before and he had a hunch.  Taking advantage of the relaxed and warm atmosphere of the laundry mat, Luke decided to ask her about it.   Do you have a photographic memory? He didnt miss the subtle intake of breathe at his words.  Ive just noticed that you never miss a detail.  Luke was trying to sound complimentary.   That obvious, huh? Lennys eyes turned down like she was embarrassed.   Only to those who are paying attention.  Luke touched her fingertips and she looked up at him.   Yeah, I do, Lenny confessed with a sigh.  Its my best kept secret.  Duke is the only one who knowsand now you.   Why do you keep it a secret? Luke asked gently.   Im afraid they wont let me compete or people would be too afraid to get to know me.  Lenny let her gaze drift to the outside world and her eyes unfocused.  I guess, thats why I love the back country so much.  Its unpredictable and it always surprises me.   You like to be surprised? Lukes question held a subtle double meaning and Lenny didnt miss it.  But instead of turning away from him she held his gaze.   Some surprises are no fun at all, she answered simply.  He knew she was referring to the pictures with the other woman.  Luke cringed internally.  Knowing her perfect memory now, he could see why that would be so hard to move past.  Its not that she was choosing to remember it, she literally could not forget.  He hated himself even more.   I don't know if I can do this, Luke.  Lenny blurted out.  She ran a hand through her long hair nervously.   Do what? He frowned, his heart flooding with panic.   It's too weird.  You showing up here after not calling me, making out with random girls and then our meltdown in front of my friends last night.  She looked weary and sad.  And you want to act like nothing has changed, act like we're friends and you can put the pieces back in places where you think they fit.  But they just don't.   Her brows pulled together as she tried to explain to him what he refused to accept as fact.  I can't pretend like I'm okay.  I'm not.  I know I left, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  But you let me go.  You made it kind of obvious that you were fine with me being gone.   I was the opposite of fine, Lenny.  I was a mess.  Luke calmly confessed.  I realize that it might take some time to get back to where we were. . . but I'm not going anywhere.  I think we can fix this. . . together.   Before Lenny could answer, the dryers buzzed simultaneously causing her to jump up and begin putting her dry clothes on the folding table.  Luke stood up slowly and joined her.  Again in silence, they sorted and folded her clean laundry.  Lenny was careful to make sure she folded all of her own bras and panties, not letting Luke even touch them.   He found it amusing that she was so protective of her undergarments.  He didnt get to see Lenny behave like a typical girl very often and he liked it.   He finished folding a shirt and reached for another.  He pulled a large blue t-shirt from the pile and frowned.  It looked familiar, and it was obviously a mans shirt.  It clicked in an instant.  It was his shirt.  The one he had given her back when they were on tour.  He glanced over at Lenny who hadnt yet noticed what he was holding and he couldnt help but smile.  She had brought it with her.  And it had ended up in the laundry which meant she had been wearing it.   And that meant she still had feelings for him.   He felt a sly smile tug at the corners of his mouth.  She was totally in love with him.  And he knew it.  He was definitely not giving up now.             Lenny saw Luke looking at her out of the corner of her eye and she glanced quickly in his direction.  Seeing the shirt he was folding, her eyes went wide.  She turned back to her task, maybe he didnt recognize it.   So, you're still wearing my shirt? Luke sounded amused.   Lenny grit her teeth and grabbed the shirt from him.  She threw all her clothes back in the bags, not bothering to fold the rest.   Cmon, Lenny, Lukes voice softened, I was just teasing.   I know.  Lenny answered flatly.  Maybe I dont feel like being teased right now.  Especially about that.  She put on her coat and charged out the door.   She heard him follow a few seconds later.  When he caught up with her, he took the heavy bags from her hands and continued forward.   She glared at the back of his head but she followed him anyway.  In the elevator, Lukes eyes twinkled with mischief.  Lenny kept her face straight, she refused to smile at him.   Do you sleep in it? He asked suggestively.   Lenny rolled her eyes, silently staring at the door of the lift.  Luke laughed at her avoidance of the question.  Outside of her door she fumbled with her key, clearly having been made uncomfortable by Lukes line of questions.   Luke leaned against the door frame, watching her.   Youre gorgeous, you know that? He said, oozing as much sensuality as his longtime experience as a rock star would allow.   Lenny dropped her key on the floor and when she bent down to retrieve it, Luke put his hand on hers.  She looked up into his penetrating gaze, their faces inches apart.  He leaned in fractionally and Lenny bolted upright.  She slid her key in the lock and quickly opened the door.  Luke stood up and Lenny grabbed the bags from his hands, throwing them into her room.   Thank you for your help with my laundry, Lenny said politely and then closed the door.  She heard Luke chuckle softly from the other side and it irritated her.  He knew what kind of power he held over her and it wasnt fair for him to use it against her like that.   Luke knocked softly on the door.  Ill just wait out here until youre hungry again.  He joked playfully from the other side.   Lenny paced in frustration.  He had her there.  She ate around the clock and there was no food in her room.  Besides, she couldnt keep avoiding him.  Especially if he was planning on coming with them tomorrow.   The worst part was that she didnt want to avoid him.  She had thoroughly enjoyed the entire day with him.  He had been sweet and attentive and adorable.  But, again, this was a bubble.  As soon as real life got involved, it would go straight to hell.   I was thinking pizza for lunch.  Luke continued through the door.  I saw a little place up the road that I wanted to try.   Lenny couldnt help but smile.  He was persistent, she would give him that.  She had missed him so much.  She found herself opening the door, against her better judgment.   Luke was leaning against the frame and he gave her his most charming smile.   Hungry? He asked coyly.   She tried to hide her smile but she couldnt.  She sighed and entered the hallway again, he fell in step beside her on the way back downstairs.   Im assuming that youre paying? Lenny asked in the elevator.   No way.  The rule is, if I pay its officially a date, he winked at her, Unless this is date?  Lennys heart skipped at his wink but she maintained composure.   Nope, just friends.  Ill pay for myself.  She looked straight ahead, refusing to get sucked into his playful gaze.             When they were seated in the booth at the small pizzeria, Lenny tried to relax again.  Lukes presence was always unnerving but even more so now that he was completely hell bent on flirting with her.  She couldn't deny that it felt good to have him there.  Her body no longer felt like it was missing a vital organ.  She glanced around and saw some of the people from her group at a different table.   She shifted, as they openly gawked.  The shouting match that had taken place in the hallway last night flashed in her mind.  They looked confused and curious and she couldnt blame them.  What was she thinking? Luke was going to be entering a hornets nest with this group.  They would undoubtedly see him as the villain and ostracize him.   This was a bad idea, Lenny said as she swirled the ice in her drink.   Its okay, Lenny, Luke tried to get her eyes to meet his.  I can take my lumps.  Ill do whatever it takes to prove that to you and anyone else who cares.   Lenny pursed her lips together.  They both had separate agendas.  She was trying to prove that they couldnt possibly work and he was trying to prove otherwise.  What a fine pair they made.             Luke saw a thousand emotions roll across Lennys face in an instant.  She seemed to settle on casual indifference and Luke felt a new wave of regret course through his veins.  He wondered if he hadnt have gone out that nightwould she have been this reserved now? How much distance did he put between them with his selfish choice?  He missed the familiarity they used to have.  Now, she was on guard, distrusting, reserved.  He missed the way she would look at him and he knew she felt safe.   Lenny cleared her throat and looked at him expectantly.  Luke realized that she had asked him a question but he hadnt heard it.   Im sorry, what? He asked apologetically.   I said, when is your return flight? Lenny frowned at his faraway look.   Uh, I dont have one.  Luke answered uncomfortably.  He saw the question on her face so he added.  I bought a one way.             The group of other riders finished their meal and gave curious glances as they departed.  Shelby Lynn waved at Lenny shyly and then went outside.   What was that all about? Luke asked.   Oh, you havent heard? Im awesome.  Lenny said saucily and laughed at her own bravado.   I have, actually, heard that.  And humble, too.  Luke smiled at her.   They were interrupted when Ben stepped over to their table.   Were going bowling tonight.  He openly glared at Luke, Nick said youre coming back up to the cabins with us tomorrow.  Luke gave a curt nod and Ben continued, So you can join us tonight if you want.   You make me feel so welcome, Luke said, impatience in his voice.   Theyll be other girls there, you sure you can control yourself? Ben asked darkly.   Ben! Lenny snapped, mortified by his behavior.   Its okay, Lenny.  Luke calmly stopped her and addressed Ben squarely.  Look man, I made some bad choices.  Im not making excuses for that.  But I love this girl and Im not gonna give up just cause you spent half an hour coming up with an insult.  He took a drink of his soda.  Wed be happy to join you for bowling tonight.   Lenny could see Ben was trying to think of something witty to reply with but came up empty.  He grunted and left.   Lennys head was swirling with a million thoughts.  And they all centered around one thing.  Luke had said that he was still in love with her.             Luke went back to eating, completely unfazed.  He looked up to see Lenny watching him with curious eyes.   What? Do I got pizza on my face? He asked, making her smile.   Nothing, Lenny replied but something had changed, infinitesimally in her eyes when she looked at him.  He had no idea what he'd said in the past few seconds to propel any kind of change, but he was happy for it.             The afternoon passed quickly.  Lenny found herself getting excited for Luke to join them on the mountain tomorrow.  She had wanted him to be a part of her life before, but the timing had been all off.  She couldnt believe that he had bought a one way ticket to Alaska.   She still felt a need to show him that a romantic relationship was impossible for them and probably a terrible idea.  But he was making it hard.  He flirted with her openly all day long.  She did her best to ignore his comments and gestures, not wanting to encourage him.  If he stood too close, she moved away.  If he reached for her hand, shed put them in her pockets.  Part of her was scared that her plan would work and hed give up, but he only tried harder.  Finding new and clever ways to flirt and catch her off guard.   At the bowling alley, the others tried their best to give Luke the cold shoulder but Lukes gregarious personality and authentic charm won them over pretty quickly.  Even Ben, who held out the longest, was eventually high-fiving Luke and buying him nachos.   Damn, Lenny, Trucker complained.  Youre kicking our asses! Is there anything youre not good at?  Yes, Shane answered from behind her, Shes a terrible dancer.   What! Lenny whirled to give him a glare but he just laughed.   You are a horrible dancer, dont deny it.  Shane handed her a soda.   Luke was getting along with everyone so well that Lenny found herself unusually miffed.  He was attentive and alert.  He answered their questions but downplayed his rock star status.  He joked around and looked genuinely at ease.  He was freaking perfect.   Dont be grumpy, Shane rebuked as he sat down beside her.   Im not being grumpy, Lenny protested even though she knew he was right.   You have a very effective frown but this is neither the time nor place.  Shane reprimanded with a smile.   Is it weird that hes getting along with everyone so well? Lenny shared her thoughts with Shane.   No, whats weird is that youre avoiding him so obviously.   Hey, you were on my side not twenty-four hours ago.  Lenny reminded him.   Yep, Shane admitted.  But then we had a bro talk.   You what? Lennys slack-jawed face caused Shane to burst out laughing.   Yeah, Luke and I are bros now.  Shane grinned at her.   Lenny put her hand to her forehead in shame.  My life is so weird, she muttered, making Shane laugh again.   I think you should give him another chance, honestly.  Shane added.   Theres no another chance to give! Am I the only one who can see this as an impending disaster? Lennys tone was desperate but Shane laughed her off again.   You forgave me, dont forget.  Shane reminded.   Whats your point? Lenny shot at him, irritated with his blas attitude.   Well, I would think it would be easier to forgive Luke, Shane answered seriously, Youre in love with him.   Lenny pursed her lips indignantly, I hate your face.  Shane guffawed as Luke sat down on the other side of her.   Whats going on over here? He asked, grabbing Lennys soda and taking a big drink.   Nothing, Lenny answered quickly, giving Shane a warning glare.   We were talking about how she needs to give you a one on one lesson on the slopes tomorrow.  Shane winked at Lenny.   Thats sounds sexy, Luke arched an eyebrow at Lenny.   Yeah, it should be real hot with all the layers of clothing involved.  Lenny answered dryly.  She was not amused.  How had both of her exes become best friends?  You bunking with me tomorrow? Shane asked Luke.   Thats what Nick said.  Luke nodded, draining the last of Lenny's soda.   Sweet, Shane fist bumped Luke and then headed to take his turn.   Lenny gave Luke a look that made him laugh.   What the hell is that all about? Lenny asked him.   Shanes a good guy.  Luke didnt give more of an explanation.   When did this happen? Lenny was confused and annoyed at the same time.   Last night.  He brought me a pillow after you slapped me silly.  Luke answered with a sly smile.   I did not slap you silly.  Lenny objected.  And Im sorry about that, by the way.  She added softly.   You dont have to apologize, I deserved it.  Luke nodded towards Shane, We have a lot in common.   Oh yeah, like what? Lenny asked in disbelief.   Well, we both have excellent taste in women.  Luke smiled at her glare and got up to refill her soda.   As the night continued on, Lenny found herself in conflict.  Why was she pushing Luke away? To prove a point? Shane was right, she was in love with him and she didn't want him leave.  She wanted him to stay.  Nothing made sense anymore.  Her previous resolve seemed so foolish and foreign with Luke's overwhelming presence all around her.   When they made their way back to their rooms and turned in, anticipating the early departure tomorrow and the promise of fresh powder, Luke stalled outside Lennys door.   Lenny unlocked her door but didnt go in right away.  She paused, holding the door open with an arm, and looked up into Lukes hopeful expression.   I had fun today, she said sincerely.             Me too.  Luke reached up and brushed a stray hair off her face.  She didnt pull away this time.   Luke wanted to kiss her.  His eyes drifted to her lips and he stared at their perfect bow shape.  But it was too soon.  He still had work to do and kissing her right now wouldnt help.  Instead, he touched her cheek with his palm and pressed his lips to the top of her forehead.   Get some sleep, beautiful.  He smiled down at her.  You have to teach me how to fly tomorrow.             Lenny smiled in return and went into her room, slowly closing the door behind her.  She sat down on the edge of the bed in a daze.   Oh no, she thought with dread, Im in way over my head.        24    All In      The four day storm had covered Thompson Pass and the Chugach Mountains with a perfect, unblemished blanket of snow.  It was pristine and lush; Lenny literally salivated when she beheld it.  The drive up had been very different than the week before.  This time, Lenny rode in the back of Nicks SUV with Luke and Serge.  The atmosphere was cheerful and mild, probably due to the presence of the unshakable Norwegian.  But it may have also been Lukes solid resolve from beside her.   Lennys discontent had taken a backseat.  She had awoken that morning feeling refreshed and alive.  Knowing Luke was going to be there gave her soul a little boost.  She didnt entirely know what that meant.  She wasnt ready to just declare all forgiven and agree to move to Boston.  But she would be lying if she said she hadnt thought about it more than once.  Luke brought a peace out in her that no one else ever had.  And it really wasnt anything he did.  It was who she naturally became when then were together.             Luke had finally gotten a good nights sleep.  He hadnt rested since Lenny had left Boston.  The first night in Alaska when he slept outside her door had been his first real sleep in weeks.  Just knowing she was close by had been enough to allow him to doze off for a few hours.  But after he had walked her to her door last night, he fell asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Hed been so upside down without her, and having her around had finally righted him.  Even if this was as close as they ever got, Luke knew without a doubt that they needed to be a part of each others lives.  She was his best friend.  And he was never taking that relationship for granted again.   They quickly unloaded their gear into their cabins and then gathered by Nick for another rundown of basic avalanche survival training.  Everyone except for Luke had already taken the training when they had first arrived but with the new snowfall, Nick wanted everyone to be refreshed before going out there.   They all passed the basic tests without any problems.  Nick reminded them that the mountains are unpredictable.  Especially with the new powder, no one would be able to tell whats sturdy and whats soft until theyre in the middle of it.             No pressure, guys, Nick spoke through his headset in the helicopter.  Were just gonna go out and make a few turns.   Lenny nodded when Nick glanced behind to make sure they had heard.  She looked at Luke who was his usual, the most relaxed and confident person in the room.  She had no idea how he could be so collected even when he was obviously out of his element.   After the chopper had set them down and then took off again, Lenny pulled Luke off to the side.   You dont have to do this, you know.  She saw his eyes shift to the mountainside and then back to her.   Yes, I do, Luke said calmly with a smile.  Besides, if I get hurt, you can give me mouth to mouth.  He laughed as she rolled her eyes.  She feigned annoyance but the idea of her lips on his again made her heart stutter.  And that annoyed her a little bit more.  Why wasnt he taking this more seriously?  You need to be a little scared, you know.  Lennys concern was growing.   I know.  And I am.  Totally terrified.  Luke grinned at her again as Shane joined them.   Ready to have your life change? Shane asked.   Do your worst.  Luke accepted the challenge.   Lenny realized that she was the one who the most nervous about Luke riding.  If anything happened to himHer stomach was full of butterflies as Shane gave Luke some pointers.  This was a bad idea.  Lenny shook her head and finally had to say something.   No.  Dont do that.  Lenny stepped in between Shane and Luke.  No offense, Shane.  She said over her shoulder then back to Luke.  Just take it slow.  We can ride this hill all day.  Dont worry about speed.  She looked down at Lukes board and bindings and realized why they had looked so familiar.  Do you have Dukes stuff?  Yeah, he said I would need it.  Luke looked at her sheepishly.  So he had been to see Duke first.  Was she really the only one who saw the ridiculousness of the situation?  Well, hes not wrong.  Duke always had the best stuff, Lenny conceded.  She would have to address that Duke issue later.   Just go slow for your first few turns and see how it feels.  Wait till you can feel how the board responds.  Were not racing.   Luke put his hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eye.  Hey, Im gonna be fine.  I promise not to do anything stupid, he said reassuringly.   She smiled, seeing the honesty in his face and tried to relax her back-flipping insides.   Cmon, Casey, Shane waved his arm and started on his run.  Luke pulled his goggles down and joined him.   Lenny held her breath as she watched them curve in and out and back and forth.  Luke was good.  He was actually very good.  He kept up with Shane just fine and Lenny could tell he was a strong rider.  His technique was a little shaking.  But that can be cleared up with practice back home.  Lenny muttered a curse under her breath for that thought.  Luke was not coming home with her.   She wasnt even surprised that Luke had been to see Duke.  She figured he had either talked to Duke or Harrison because they were the only ones who knew she was in Alaska.  She wished shed gotten a little more of a heads up though.  Shed have to give Duke a hard time for that one.   She was a little shocked that Duke had loaned his stuff to Luke.  That was the equivalent of letting someone take your firstborn across the country.  Duke never let anyone touch his stuff.  Either Duke was getting soft in his old age or this was his version of giving Luke his blessing.  Lenny suspected the latter.  And that thought only added to her frustration.   Her heart stumbled in conjunction with Luke's wipe-out.  He had been doing fine when he lost control and tumbled end over end.  Shane had led him over a small lip and he caught air.  He was clearly unprepared for it and he lost control before he'd even landed.   Lenny didn't even wait for him to come to a complete stop.  She was already flying that direction, her heart in her throat.   She edged her board to a stop so fast, she could have had her own fall if she wouldn't have already disengaged her binders and was in near sprint across the snowy terrain.  She threw off her goggles and hat and sank to her knees in the snow next to Luke's upturned figure.   He was flat on his back, his arms outspread.  She cleared the snow that had packed in around his face, her breath coming laboriously.   Luke? She pushed his goggles up and stopped.  His perfect blue eyes were looking at her with a bemused, almost whimsical expression.   Were you worried? He asked, his mouth making a crooked grin.   Lenny wanted to hug him and kick him at the same time.  She bit her bottom lip and shook her head.   Luke pushed himself into a sitting position and grinned at her.  You came rushing to my side at the first sign of trouble.  I've taken worse falls off the stage.  He raised his eyebrows as if to make some point.   I'm glad you're okay.  Lenny finally said as she returned to her feet.  She was blushing at her reaction to his mini-wreck and she was glad he couldn't tell due to the cold air on her face.   What if I would have gotten hurt? Luke asked as he disengaged his board and stood as well.  He put his hands on his hips and looked at her with a cocky self-assurance.  Would you be sad?  Lenny rolled her eyes and walked back to where she'd left her board near-buried a short distance away.   You woulda cried, I bet.  Luke followed behind her.  She smiled to herself, glad he couldn't see her reaction.   The rest of the day went by smoothly.  No injuries, no avalanches.  Shane and Luke brought an energy to the group that hadnt been there the week before.  They had bonded quickly and Luke was a complete natural on the mountain.  Just like the night before when they were all bowling together, Luke was everyones best friend.  He fit so perfectly in the group that Lenny was actually shaken up by it.  Not in a scared waywell, maybe in a scared way.  Had she been wrong this whole time? Was her fear of the oncoming heartache all in her head? Was she really the only one who could ruin this?  They returned to base camp that night and Trucker and Smitty built a bonfire.  The crew was still amped from an easy day on the slopes and they needed to expel a little of that extra energy.   The fire burned tall and bright against the blackness of the Alaskan sky.  Some people were roasting marshmallows, a few were drinking beers.  Light conversation and laughter floated through the air.   Lenny sat on a log near the fire, a little removed from the group.  She stared into the orange glow and let her tense muscles relax with the buzzing of her friends voices nearby.   So much had happened in the span of a few days.  The emotional ups and downs had been hard to keep up with.  And now, she had to get her head together and figure out what the next step was.  She thought she had this all figured out when she had left Europe but it had hurt more than she had anticipated.  She wasnt sure, that when push came to shove, she could willingly walk away from Luke again.  Even if it was better for them both.  It hurt too much.   Luke sat down next to her on the log, pushing close against her side till she moved over so he had room.   Did you have fun today? He asked her, pulling a charred marshmallow off of a stick.   Yeah, did you? She asked giving him a small smile.  She was desperately trying to keep an emotional barrier between them.  Luke always made her question every single one of her rational thoughts.   Luke popped the mallow into his mouth and grinned at her.  She couldnt help but grin back, his happy smile was infectious.   I always have the best day when its been a day with you.  Luke said after he swallowed his mouthful a little more serious as he spoke.  Her heart strangled in her chest.  Thats exactly how she felt too.   Lenny had always been extremely independent.  Which is probably why shed chosen snowboarding as the first love of her life.  It was free and wild, just like her.  She loved her family and they had always supported her.  But even they couldnt explain the side of Lenny that came out when she was shredding a gorgeous line.  Traveling and boarding all over the world, she had gotten to meet some exceptional people.  She never had a problem making friends but she hadnt truly made any deep connections.  Not until she ran away with rock stars.   Even now, without Mike, Blake, Harrison and Sway here, she felthomesick.  Lukes close proximity only made that feeling stronger.  She had tried, really tried, to keep her barrier intact.  But those rowdy group of men had won over her heart.  And one of them in particular held more of heart than she had consciously agreed to.   She gave a sideways glance to Luke and tried not to stare at how the fire reflected in his pale blue eyes, making them glow even more intensely.  The entire tour he hadnt so much as looked at another woman.  Not that there werent any around.  Women were constantly throwing themselves at the band.  They would do horrible things to get attention.  Shameful, self-depreciating things.  But the guys were professionals, and the tour had been clean and relatively easy.  Thats what had been so shocking about the paparazzi photos of Luke with whoever that had been.  It was so uncharacteristic of the Luke that she knew.  But there it had been, in full, high definition color, the truth of what a life of fame often entailed.  Lenny wasnt sure if she could live that life.   Do you want a mallow? Luke asked her, reloading his stick.   Um, sure.  Lenny tried to pull her thoughts back to the present.   Luke lit the marshmallow on fire and slowly turned the stick so it burned evenly all the way around.  He presented the perfectly roasted mallow to Lenny and she gingerly removed it from the stick.  She couldnt help but smile at his proud grin.   Luke leaned against her as she stuck the gooey treat in her mouth.  He rested his chin on her shoulder, looking directly at her face.   Is it good? He asked, eyebrows going up.   Lenny laughed out loud at his behavior and playfully shoved him off of her.   Luke chuckled, that low, hearty chuckle that sent shivers through her.  She knew she was blushing but was hoping that the glow from the fire was covering it up.   Luke casually let his arm drape across her back and she instinctively leaned closer to him.  After a few moments Lenny rested her head on his shoulder.  They sat in silence, staring into the fire.  Luke pressed his cheek against the top of her head and let out a contented sigh.  Lenny knew what it meant because she was feeling the same way.  It was like finally coming home.   No one bothered them.  They left them in their own little world.  Lenny had started to pick up on the collective thought of the group that she needed to stop resisting Lukes attempts at reconciliation.  She had feared they would hate him, nearly the opposite had occurred.  It seemed Lenny was the only one who was still unsure.  No, that wasnt it.  Its not that she was unsure, it was that she was the only one who hadnt gotten caught up in the romanticized scenario that had been playing out for all of them to see.  She was the only one who could see the truth.  And the truth was that Lukes life came with certaincomplications.   If she went back with him, it might be great for a while.  But eventually, they wouldnt be able to see each other every day.  And Lenny didnt know if that would count as being on a break for Luke again.  Would he seek solace with someone else? Or maybe hed get tired of her all together and trade her in for someone far prettier and moreexperienced.  She swallowed at that last thought.  She didnt really have much to offer.             Lenny sighed and Luke glanced down at her face, lit by the roaring fire.  He was beyond happy to be this near to her again but he was still intimidated by her presence.  She was strong and brave and tender.  Her eyes missed nothing, her heart felt everything.  She was completely different than any woman hed ever met.  She spoke her mind but with kindness.  Shed risk everything to protect those she loved.  She was always trying to do the right thing, not just what felt good in the moment.  Luke had no idea how he had ever gotten her to look at him in the first place.  She could honestly have her pick of anyone out there.   But Luke knew he was the only one who was willing to fight this hard to keep her.             After a long while, the fire started to burn down and the other riders started to go to bed.  Lenny knew they should probably turn in as well but she didnt want to move.  If they got up and went to their separate cabins then she would have to face reality again.  And she still hadnt made any definite decisions.   Its getting late.  Luke murmured against her hair.   Mmhm.  Lenny confirmed, still not moving away.   Cmon, Luke stood up, pulling Lenny with him.  Ill walk you to your cabin.  His fingers found and intertwined into hers and they slowly walked across the snow packed ground.   The light inside was on which meant that Shelby Lynn was in there and awake.  Lenny slowed as they got closer to the door.  Not wanting the peaceful moment to end.   Luke stopped walking and turned to face her, pulling her into his strong embrace.  He hugged her tight against him and she wished there was more time.   How about if you meet me for breakfast tomorrow? Luke asked.   Lenny nodded, swallowing away the emotion that came out of nowhere.  Why was it so hard to say goodnight? She would be seeing him again in the morning.  Because every goodnight is closer to goodbye.  Again.   Luke leaned down and kissed her cheek softly.  His lips were warm on her cold skin and Lenny felt a tingle run through her.  She gave him a shy, sad smile before going inside.   Shelby Lynn was propped up on one elbow when Lenny came through the door.  She watched quietly as Lenny changed and crawled up the ladder into the top bunk.   Are you gonna take him back? Shelby asked as Lenny reached for the string to turn the light off.   Lenny paused at the question.  She wasnt sure how to answer.  Was Luke really hers to take back?  Why do you ask? Lenny asked instead, pulling the switch and enclosing the room in darkness.   Because we all think you should.   Lenny smiled in the dark room.  All of you think that, huh?  Well, its just been the most exciting thing thats happened all week.  We obviously talked about it.  Shelby adjusted her covers making the wooden structure rock slightly.   Its not a reality show, S. L.  Lenny pointed out.  The audience doesnt get a vote.   I know.  Shelby was quiet for a few minutes and then she sleepily sighed, You guys are so great together.   Lenny pursed her lips up at the ceiling.  The cabin grew quiet, Lenny heard Shelbys breathing even out and knew she had fallen asleep.  Lenny wasnt so lucky.  She lay awake for a long while after that, trying to figure out why Shelbys logic seemed so sound.             The next day brought more adventure and even more confusing thoughts for Lenny.  The group stayed together again and took some turns.  Travis and Trucker started a slight competition with a small jump and pretty soon everyone was being a little more risky with their lines.   Luke was his amazing, charming, smooth self.  Lenny loved how he fit in perfectly with her group of friends but that didnt mean what she knew he was hoping it would mean.  She still couldnt shake the thoughts from the night before.  He was a rock star.  He would always be a rock star.  And it would take a special kind of woman to be able to deal with all the things that came along with that.  Lenny wasn't sure if she would ever fit into that category.             Luke was having a blast.  Snowboarding was his new favorite thing.  Lennys friends were awesome and being around Lenny was. . . intoxicating, as usual.  She was unbelievable on the snow.  Everything she did seemed effortless.   She had raced Serge to the bottom of a very steep mountain, tying Lukes stomach in knots.  But he couldnt help but let his heart swell with pride at her confidence and talent.   When the others started doing some risky flips and rotations, she blew them all away.  They had gotten heated and Lenny had removed her coat and flannel.  She was wearing her black snow pants and a form fitting black tank with the entire back made out of lace.  Luke assumed that every guy was checking her out but there was nothing he could do about it.  She was captivating.  Her perfect body twisted and soared in the air, her blonde hair glowing like a halo in the bright sunlight.  She had no idea how beautiful she was.   When they got ready to head back to base, Lenny put her coat back on and Luke knew he heard some sad groans from the guys around them.  She didnt even notice.  Of course she didnt.  She wasnt one of those girls.  She had no clue that very often she was the most gorgeous woman in the room.  Luke had a devilish thought then.  If Lenny knew how hot she was, with her confidence, the world would be doomed.   He chuckled at himself as he followed her into the helicopter.  She gave him a frown that was more of a question and he just shook his head.   Everyone gravitated to the Lodge for the evenings activities.  Luke sat up at the bar and watched Lenny try to teach Shelby Lynn how to play pool.  It was comical and sweet at the same time.  Lenny was good, like everything else in her life, but Shelby Lynn was very uncoordinated.  She kept getting frustrated and would want to give up but Lennys patient words would bring her back to try again.   Shane took a seat next to Luke and nodded at the bartender for a beer.  When he got it and took a sip, he chuckled at Luke.   Youre so obvious.  Shane laughed again and Luke smirked, knowing hed been caught watching Lenny.   I cant help it.  Luke replied honestly.  Lenny looked up and caught his stare.  He didnt even try to hide it, instead he winked at her.  He thought he saw her blush slightly before shaking her head and going back to Shelby Lynn.   Have you guys talked anymore? Shane asked curiously.   Luke sighed heavily.  No, not really.  He frowned slightly.  Shes being pretty stubborn.   Yeah, that sounds like Lenny.  Shane smiled around the lip of his glass.   Luke scanned the room, trying to come up with some kind of profound plan.  He had thought that just spending time in Lennys world would prove that their relationship could work.  But he was starting to get the feeling there was more to her rigidness than that.  She wasnt being completely forthright with him and he needed to get her to open up to him.  Once and for all.   Thats when Luke spotted the unused dance floor tucked back in a corner.  It was just beyond the jukebox.  The lights around it werent on so thats why he didnt see it.  It wasnt in complete darkness but it would provide a nice little private space for them to talk without her feeling completely trapped.  All he had to do was convince her to dance with him.   Luke grinned at Shane, I have an idea.   He hopped off his stool and made his way to the jukebox.  He glanced over the song lists and starting pumping quarters in the machine.  He thought hed need about six songs for a decent conversation.  He chose all slow, cheesy ballads, knowing shed at least find humor in it if nothing else.   As Neil Diamonds husky voice started to sing Hello Again, Luke approached Lenny from behind.  He saw Shelby Lynns eyes get wide but Lenny didnt turn around.  Luke smiled and gently clasped her wrist, slowly twisting her to face him.  She was curious and her eyes sparkled.  Luke didnt say anything as he gently tugged her towards the dance floor.   He put his hands on her waist and she automatically rested her hands on his shoulders.  She looked uncomfortable and Luke noticed right away that she was not a very good dancer at all.  He kept the pace slow and she focused on the center of his chest, concentrating on the movements of her feet.   I think we should talk, Luke began in a hushed voice.  He saw Lenny swallow and she subtly nodded.   I want you, Luke said plainly.  Lennys eyes flashed up to his and her face flushed with his choice of words.  He chuckled as he realized how that sounded.  I mean, I want you with me.  His face growing more serious.  I want you back in my life.   Another verse went by as he waited for her response.  When she spoke, her words came out stiffly, like it was hard for her to say them.   Luke She began slowly, Youre a rock starand with that comes certaincomplications.   Luke frowned down at her face but he didnt interrupt.   I don't know how I can beokay, knowing that the moment were not together for a few days, youll have women standing in line to fill that void for you.   Its not like that.  Luke protested.  I made a really bad choice-  Luke, we had only been apart for a little while and you Lenny swallowed again.  You-  I know.  Luke began to plead.  I really screwed up, but it won't ever happen again.   Lenny's eyebrows pushed together with confusion.  But, Luke, when you love someone, it doesnt matter if youre on a break.  That person should still be the only one  Lukes heart froze in his chest as he realized what she was telling him.  He couldnt undo what he had done.  She was right.  He had been in love with her and had allowed himself to look intoother options.  If she had been out kissing other guys he would have felt completely betrayed.  He had never put himself in her position.  The idea of Lenny with someone elsekissing him, holding himloving him.  His pulse began to quicken with the rising panic of losing Lenny forever.   Its hard tostart over.  Her words were tiny slices in his heart, stripping away the hope he had left.  I cant forget-  I know, you cant forget.  But maybe you could forgive.  Lukes grip around her tightened, like he was afraid she would walk away from him any minute.  Im so madly in love with you I cant think straight.  Youre all I want.  I can give up the band, the music, Boston.  All of it.  Anything.  Just not you.  Lukes words were pouring out, he couldnt stop them if he wanted to.  I know I messed up.  I hate what I did.  I never wanted to hurt you.  Ever.  I should have fought for you from the beginning.  I shouldve never let you walk awayI need you in my life.  Youre Lukes voice cracked.  youre my best friend, Lenny.             Try to think about the future, Luke.  Lennys voice sounded small, even to her but she needed to get it out.  What happens when were separated? When Im competing, maybe, and youre around the world? And you get lonely? Youre the sexy lead singer of a major band, in case youve forgottenyou wouldnt be lonely for longand I dont think, no, I know I cant compete with that.  Im just Lenny searched for the right explanation.  a regular person.  Her eyes settled on his chin as she said the words.   You are not a regular person.  Luke's firm voice brought her eyes back up to his.  His jaw clenched in seriousness.  You are a hell of a woman.  His eyes shone with emotion.  Youre it.  He brought one hand up to rest on her cheek.  There is no competition.  You have my heart.   Lenny had no words left.  She couldnt deny that her heart still ached to be near Luke.  That the only time shed felt any kind of peace in the past couple of weeks was when he had shown up in Valdez.  She couldnt refute that even the simple act of him holding her in his arms on the deserted dance floor made her whole body tremble with excitement.   I have never known anyone like you, Lenny.  You are brave and strong and beautiful.  You make me think I can be a better person.  More importantly, you make me want to be a better person.  He took a careful breath.  I know we dont have it all figured out.  I know Im probably gonna screw up a few more times and make you mad at me.  But I also know that youre the one I want to be with to figure these things out.  I dont want to do this life without you, my best friend.  I'm crazy in love with you.   Luke pulled her closer, holding her tight.  He touched his forehead to hers so he could look her directly in the eye.   Please, Lenny.  Please, Luke whispered, his deep voice raspy.  Forgive meI should have told you every day that I loved you.  Youre the most amazing womanIyoureeverything to meyou deserve better than me but, dammit! Im not gonna ever stop trying to show you how incredible you are and how incredible we are when we're together.   In that moment Lenny knew her heart had been misleading her the whole time.  She had been so afraid of following it blindly that she had made all of her decisions based on fear.  And they had been the wrong ones.  Luke in her life was the only thing that made sense.   She closed her eyes, and licked her lips slowly.  Okay.  She whispered.   Before she could open her eyes to see his reaction his lips crashed into hers.  His hands pressed into her back drawing her body flush against his.  She tangled her fingers in his hair and pulled his head in, deepening their kiss.  Her body reacted forcefully, feeling like it would never be close enough to him.   Lenny surrendered her heart fully to him.  No more second guessing or hesitation in her thoughts.  This was it.  No matter what happened in the future, she knew that Lukes arms would forever be her home.  She could never go back to a life without them.   The room broke out into applause and Lenny disrupted her kiss with Luke, laughing.  She had forgotten that they were surrounded by a bunch of people.  Luke still didnt seem to notice or maybe he just didnt care.  He continued kissing her face and neck.  He finally stepped back and addressed the onlookers.   Thank you, thank you.  Luke bowed and Lenny shook her head at him, a smile still on her lips.  Always the entertainer.  He grabbed her hand and kissed it affectionately and tugged her in the direction of the bar.   You finally get all that figured out? Shane asked with a grin.   Not all of it Lenny looked over at Luke who was beaming at her and he slipped an arm around her waist, pulling her to his side.  But the rest is just details.  She finished with a content smile.   Good.  Shane handed them each a beer and then toasted them.   Lenny wasnt sure what was going to happen next but as she looked up at Luke and he pulled her tighter against him, she knewthey would get through it together.             Luke couldn't believe the peace that had descended over him.  He looked down at Lenny's laughing face and he knew. . . everything was going to okay now.  He wasn't going to screw this up again.   She caught him looking at her and her face took on a puzzled expression.   What? He nuzzled her neck.  Staying away from her was going to be even more difficult now.   Why me, Luke?  He pulled away, unable to hide the shock on his face.  Why you? Are you serious?  Lenny smiled shyly and bit her bottom lip.  Yeah, why me?  Because youre smart and funny and a good kisser.  He grinned when she smiled.  Because, you make me feel like Im worth a damn.  Because when the rest of the world doesnt make sense, you do.  Because when were together, were unstoppable.  He rested his forehead against hers and looked her in the eyes.  Because youre my very best friend in the whole world and Im never gonna let you go.       Epilogue    Sweetness      All Im saying is, I think four weeks is more than enough time for a Honeymoon.   Sway was bitching again.  Harrison rolled his eyes and continued to pretend he was readingWhat magazine is this again?  We have to be in L. A.  in two weeks and we dont have anything good to work with yet and hes unreachable.  He put his fingers in the air to symbolize the air quotes while making a snotty expression.   Dude, shut up, Mike looked at Sway with his eyebrows raised.  Blake and I have written some kick ass stuff so stop insulting us.  He got up from the couch and moved to the fridge.  Besides, Luke gave us everything he had before he left.   Sway made a disgruntled noise in the back of his throat and flopped himself into a chair, looking dejected.             Let the man enjoy his honeymoon, for Petes sake.  Mike said from Blakes kitchen.  He pulled out some leftover pizza still in the box from the fridge, opened the lid and gave it a cautious smell.  Nope, no should eat that, theyll die.  He left it on the counter.   Is Sway still bitching? Blake asked as he reentered the room.  He picked up a slice of the cold pizza off the counter and took a bite.  Mike eyed him warily but didnt say anything.   We should be able to call him.  Sway grumbled.   No man.  Mike frowned severely at him.  Let him enjoy his wife.   What could possibly be so important that they needed to disappear for a whole month? Sway asked like he had a point.   Mike stared at him incredulous.  Are you really that thick? He asked honestly.   Sway frowned back, looking like a belligerent teenager.             Theyre probably having sex! Harrison finally snapped.   So, Ive had lots of sex.  Sway almost grinned at his own words.   Yeah, well, theyre not you.  Harrison tossed the magazine aside and looked at Sway seriously.  Luke and Lenny waited to get married.  And Lenny was a virgin.  Harrison felt his face heating up.  I really cant believe I have to explain this to you.   Sway stared at him for a few minutes as he processed his words.  Suddenly the proper synapses in Sways brain fired and understanding dawned on him.  His eyes grew wide.   Ooohhh.  He drew out the word making Blake chuckle and Mike and Harrison roll their eyes.   Youre such a dumbass.  Blake laughed again.   Harrison ran both hands through his thick, dark hair and addressed Mike.  You suppose theyll get their own bus?  I hope so.  Mike sniffed, I really dont want to share a bus with newlyweds.  He picked up the phone to dial for fresh pizza.   Where do you think theyll live? Harrison asked Blake.   Blake chewed thoughtfully and swallowed before answering.  I dont know.  Luke is technically still homeless.   Yeah, he ruined all my towels.  Sway spoke up.   Maybe hell move to Wyoming.  Blake pointed out.   Yeah, maybe.  Harrison grew quiet.  He was really happy for his friends but he also hated change.  Do you think they might get a place here? He asked hopefully.   Maybe.  Blake nodded and started on another piece of cold pizza.   I bet Lenny is gonna be super hot when they get back.  Sway said with a wistful expression.  Shell be all tan from spending a month in Hawaii.  He made a clicking noise with his tongue.   No.  Blake corrected him, shaking his head.  You cant check Lenny out anymore.   Why not? Sway was getting overly frustrated.   Cuz theyre married now.  That would be like checking out your sister.  Blake answered matter of fact.   Sway sighed heavily as he thought that one through.  Fine.  He slumped his shoulders in resignation.             What happened with that girl you were seeing? Mike asked now that he was off the phone.  Sway was always a little tamer and easier to get along with when he was in a relationship.  His attitude indicated he was single again.   Eh, she left me for a stunt man.  Sway mumbled.   Really? Im sorry man.  Mike meant that, he didnt like to see his friends get hurt.   Its all right.  Apparently he can set himself on fire.  Sway tried to lighten his expression.  How can I really compete with that?  Mike still found it amazing that Sway had been in a monogamous relationship for more than a month.  It really showed growth.   Of course, they were all growing, werent they? Luke getting married was just the first big step.  It would only snowball from here.  As he looked around Blakes loft at his closest friends, he felt a peaceful energy deep inside.  He, for one, was looking forward to what the future would bring.  It was time to see what they were capable of in real life.

2,0,"   Judd looked in the car and watched Lisa rifle through her bag of clothes while tapping his finger on his camera and losing his patience.  She was digging for the right outfit for their photo-shoot, parked on the side of a gravel road next to a large abandon building which was in major disrepair.  The property was fenced with the exception of the entrance which had no gate or signs warning against trespassers.  On the west side was a barbed wire fence with a sign that told of how this building used to be an old school house with the date of its construction.  Both Judd and Lisa thought this would make a great spot for a shoot, especially if they could get inside the building.  You about ready? Judd asked.   Im looking for my lip gloss, Lisa replied, digging in her bag.   I dont want to spend a lot of time here, you never know who might show up.   Its public property, Lisa replied.   Are you sure?  There is nothing saying we cant be here, it used to be an old school house, and this must be public property.   Judd looked to the north towards the nearest farm house and wondered if anyone was at home.  Although this looked like public land, who knew for sure?  I found it, Lisa said and got out of the car, she was topless, wearing only a miniskirt and cowgirl boots.   You better cover your tits, Judd said.  Lots of country folk out here would love to catch a shot of your boobs.   Lisa pulled out some clothes and bunched them up against her chest.  There, nobody will see anything.   Lets go, Judd said and led Lisa down the path to the property, Judd paused for a moment wondering if this was really public property or not.  Lets make this quick, he added and helped Lisa walk across the soft ground to the abandon building fifty yards away.  I have some ideas if we can get in the building, Judd said.   Like what?  I want to do a full topless set before we do the nudes, do you still want porn? he asked.   Yeah, I want everything, she replied knowing she needed a set to send to the porn modeling site.   Did you bring toys?  I brought a dildo, she replied.  Ill use my fingers for everything else.   Let me set up the shots, Judd said, Im pretty good at coming up with ideas.   So am I, Lisa snapped back.   Dont get pissy, Im not just a camera jockey, I have some skill.   I know, thats why I asked you to shoot me, Lisa replied.  But I know what I want to send them.  After my ideas are done, we can do what you want.   By now the two were approaching the abandon building when out of the corner of his eye Judd spied a pickup truck pull onto the property and stop.  He turned and said, Look, somebodys here.   Lisa turned to look, Fuck, what are they doing here?  I dont know, but I better find out.  Judd stepped away from Lisa and took off walking towards the truck.  He forgot he had a pellet gun pistol tucked in his belt as a shooting prop.  Once he got to the truck he noticed an old man in the passenger seat with a white beard and coveralls.  In the front seat was a forty year old something farmer with an unshaven face and seed corn cap.   Is this your property? Judd asked squinting in the sun.   Yes it is, the driver replied.   Sorry, theres no sign saying No trespassing.   We dont need no fucking sign, the passenger snapped back.   Actually you do, without a posted sign, we cant be charged with trespassing.  This looks like public property anyway, there is no gate and that sign looks like a historical marker.   Dont matter, its my property, has been for twenty years now, the driver said.   Sorry, well leave.   Are you two doing something you shouldnt be doing? the driver asked.   Pardon me? Judd asked back.   Youre girlfriend there has no top on,  Judd looked back at Lisa and saw her standing covering her top with her costumes.  Shes not naked, Judd said.   I dont appreciate what you have in your belt either, the driver said.   It only took a second for Judd to realize what the driver was talking about, the pistol in his back belt loop.  He foolishly pulled it out to show the men it was a toy prop but before he could get it all the way out the driver said, I got more like that you in this truck, be careful what you do.   The pellet gun had been manufactured before the orange tip was required by law so it did look real from a distance.   Its a pellet gun, Judd said holding it up for both men in the truck to see.   Yeah, maybe, but you need to get off my property, I already called the sheriff.   I told you wed leave, now give us a minute to go.   What kind of pictures are you taking? the driver asked.   Shes a model.   What kind of model?  The regular kind, Judd replied.   Wheres her shirt?  In her bag, Judd replied.   Do you think you should be doing that kind of pictures?  What I shoot is my business, now l need to get going.   Not on my property it isnt, we dont need some naked girl running around here getting her picture taken.  What kind of perv are you?  Now pissed, Judd replied, Shes an adult, Im sorry we came onto your property, it wasnt posted as private property, but now we are going.   Not yet, I want to see her.   You said a second ago that you didnt need a naked girl running around, and now you want to see her?  Are you going to stop me?  Not knowing how to answer the question, Judd stood there silent.   Tell her to get over here, the driver said.   No, I wont.   Both men looked at each other like it was a Mexican standoff saying nothing.  Judd knew the farmer probably had the gun he claimed he had, but Judd also felt he could bluff his way out, especially if the sheriff was on the way.   Well wait for the sheriff, Judd said.   I know the sheriff, hes a good friend of mine.  You best do as I say.   Judd motioned for Lisa to come over, not to meet these two freaks, but to head on over to his car and leave.  It was then the passenger got out of the drivers side and hobbled around the truck with a limp.  He stopped at the front bumper and leaned his weight on the fender.  I want to see the girl too, he stated, practically drooling.   I dont get you two, you act like were doing something lewd, and then you want to see it?  The driver replied, You got it buddy.   Lisa walked over to Judd and stood next to him still clutching her clothes to her large breasts.  Whats going on? she asked.   These guys want to see you.   See me? Lisa asked.   Let me see your tits, the passenger said drooling like an eighty year old pervert.   Nobody is going to see my tits, Lisa replied.   The driver replied, Youre on my property, I can see your tits if I want.   Yep, thats the law! the passenger said rubbing his crotch with his hands.   Maybe you should show them your tits, Judd said.   No fucking way! Lisa replied.   He said he has a gun in the truck, these are farmers, and they always have guns  I dont see a gun, lets get the hell out of here, Lisa said and took off walking towards the car still parked on the gravel road.   Get your ass back here honey! the driver said getting out of the truck holding the rifle he had been hiding behind the door.   Lisa continued to walk away not paying attention to the man yelling at her.  The driver took off walking, following Lisa across the soft dirt field towards the car.  He picked up speed and finally took off in a jog until he reached her grabbing her by the arm spilling her clothes and his gun onto the ground.  Lisa spun around and her massive breasts swung into plain view.   Now those are some nice tits! the driver said smiling back to the passenger still leaning against the truck.   Lisa bent over to pick up her clothes from the soft dirt at her feet when she felt the driver push her back.   No, no, I like you just like that, he said with a toothless grin.   Fuck you, she said and kicked dirt into his face.  She picked up a shirt and took off towards the car leaving the driver, the passenger and Judd behind.   Judd watched from across the field feeling anxious and angry.  Did you guys really call the sheriff? he asked.   The passenger walked around the truck keeping one hand on the frame to help keep his balance.  Fuck no, we just wanted to scare the shit out of you.   Is this really your property?  Yeah, it is, actually it belongs to his mother.   Youre not his dad?  Im the hired help dumb ass, I feed cows and shit like that.   By now the driver had walked back to the truck and stood looking at Judd.  His gun was still sitting back where Lisas clothes were on the ground.  Your girlfriend is waiting for you, he said.   You going to let me go? Judd asked.   If I see any pictures of my property anywhere on the internet, Ill come find you and kick your ass, you understand me?  You just attacked a half-naked woman and youre threatening me? I should call the sheriff on you!  Go ahead, its your word against mine.   Judd shrugged his shoulders and walked away towards his car.  When he got to the drivers rifle he picked it up and kept walking.   Hey! Put that down! the driver yelled.   Judd stopped and looked back at the two men standing next to the truck.  Fuck you, come and get it! he yelled.  Normally he would never act like this, but he was beyond pissed and not his usual self.  It didnt take long for the two men to get in the truck and spin out taking off towards him.  At this distance to his car, it wasnt worth running, he knew he wouldnt make it, he also knew he didnt know how to operate the rifle.  So now what? He had to wait to see what happened for he dug himself a hole too big to crawl out of.   In a blink of an eye, the truck slid to a halt kicking up dust and covering Judd in a cloud he couldnt see through.  He could only hope he wouldnt be hit.  A breeze pushed away the dust cloud and three feet in front of him the truck sat revving.  Judd knew he was fucked so he tossed the rifle on the hood and turned to walk away.  It was at that point he lost all memory of what occurred next.        2   In a cup      Judd woke to the painful sensation of being ran over by a truck.  He was in a room he didnt recognize with the smell of a backed up sewer.  Lisa was tied up in a chair, nude, against the wall in a dimly lit hallway.  In the air was the distant sound of a radio playing a song by the band Boston.  It was familiar, but he didnt know the name.  Sitting on an office chair in his boxers, jerking off was the driver looking at a porn site.   Who the fuck are you? Judd asked.   The driver took his hand off his cock for a moment and turned to look at Judd lying on the ground tied up.  Paul, the man said.   What are you doing? Judd asked.   Jacking off, what does it look like? Paul replied.   What are you doing to Lisa?  Your girl?  Shes tied up naked in the hall,  Yeah?  You have a real naked woman twenty feet away and youre jerking it to porn?  What makes you think I didnt fuck her already? Paul asked with a shit eating grin.   Did you?  No, I have to ask momma first, when she gets home.   Judd looked over to Lisa to see if she was awake, by now she had heard his voice and was looking over at him.  You ok? Judd asked.   Im ok, for now, whats going on?  I dont know, Paul here is waiting for his mother to come home.  Judd replied.  Paul, how old are you? Judd asked.   Fifty six, Paul replied not stopping for a moment from jerking his cock.   Can you stop that while we talk?  Paul turned around in his seat exposing his hard cock to Judd.  His balls hung down over the seat of the chair.  Im like five minutes from blowing my wad, can you wait a minute? Whats so fucking important?  Im tied up, thats important, so is she!  Five minutes, hold on, Paul said and went back to his jerking.   When does your mother get home?  In fifteen minutes, now shut up! I have to get done before she gets home!  What happens if she gets home too soon? Are you afraid shell catch you? Judd asked.   No, I have to do this every day before she gets home, I put it in a cup and give it to her, if I dont have it ready to go, and she beats me.   What? Judd asked dumbfounded.  She wants you to jerk off to porn?  Yes, I have too.   Why?  She sells it online, Judd replied.   That is so fucking gross, who buys used splooge?  I dont sell it, she does, and she gets good money for it, so shut up so I can get done.   Shaking his head, Judd watched Paul go at it as fast as he could from the back.  In the hall, he could still see Lisa tied up to her chair looking at him for help.  She had to know Judd was tied up and couldnt do anything, but she still looked to him like a helpless puppy dog.   Just then they all heard a door slam and a woman yelling, Paul, you got my blow?  Almost mother, give me a minute!  Hurry up or Ill come get it out of you! her voice came from up the stairs.  Then they could hear her footsteps on the stairs and knew she was coming downstairs.  Holy fuck! Who is this? she asked, then she looked in the hall and saw Lisa, and her?  Paul stopped jerking for a second to answer his mother.  They were on the school house property taking filthy pictures, Paul replied.   What are they doing here? she asked.   They wouldnt leave, so I had to run him over, and then I grabbed her and brought them both down here.   Shit, she said under her breath.  The woman, momma was very fit for a woman in her seventies.  Long grey hair and a decent body, not what Judd would expect? Hows my blow coming? she asked Paul.   With all this going on, I cant concentrate, Paul replied.   I got to have it, I have customers waiting, she replied in disgust.  Here, let me help, she added walking over to Paul.  Let me see it, she said getting down on her knees.   Paul let his mother have access to his cock and she took it in her hand and began to jerk quickly back and forth.  How is that? she asked.   Paul leaned back in ecstasy and began to quake in pleasure.  You might need to do more momma, Im really stressed.   Ok, she said and took Pauls cock in her mouth and began to give him a blow job.  She pulled his cock out of her mouth and asked, Where is the cup?  Paul handed her the cup and she went back down on Paul and continued to give him head.  With a motion of his hand, he signaled to his mother that he was ready to blow, she pulled his cock out of her mouth and put the tip of his penis in the cup and watched him blow as she continued to stroke him.  When he was done she held the cup up to the light, Twenty milliliters, not bad, she said and put the lid on the cup.  She looked over to Judd and said, I bet I could get that much out of you.   What? Judd asked.  Im all for a good blow job, but Im no bull you can squeeze out.   Whats it to you? All you have to do is lie there, she replied.   Im not jerking off for you!  Youre girlfriend in the hall can blow you, Momma replied.   Shes not my girlfriend, shes a model I was doing a shoot for.   Model eh? Looks like a dime store whore to me.   Fuck you! Lisa yelled from the hall.   Let me put this in the fridge, Ill be back in a minute, Momma said walking into the next room.   What the fuck is going on here Paul? What kind of farm do you run?  We have cattle, and about two hundred acres of corn, why do you ask?  Youre selling splooge on EBay for Gods sake!  Its legal, I think, Paul replied.   Actually its not, Momma said returning to the room.  I have to sell this through certain chat rooms.   How long have you been doing this? Judd asked.   Momma looked to Paul as if he had an answer.  He didnt so she replied, About three years now.   Are you saying youve made your son jack off every day for three years?  Yes, all men do it, why not profit from it?  Who buys it? Judd asked.   Its a chat room, I dont ask names.   Why is there a market for it? Who uses it?  Like I said, I dont ask questions, when the transaction clears, I put it in the mail.   How often do you help your boy out?  Not often, maybe once a month.  I dont like touching that gross thing, but I get three hundred a bottle.  For that, Id suck off a dog.   Judd thought for a moment and tried to digest what was going on.  When do we get to leave?  Momma replied, Not sure, I didnt expect my boy to be dragging home strangers.  Im not exactly sure what to do with you.   We wont tell anyone, just let us go.   Im not stupid, I know youll go running to the sheriff the second I let you go.  I dont want to keep you here, but what can I do? Dumbass here kidnapped you, thats prison time.   Paul chimed in, Momma, they were trespassing, they broke the law first.   Even so, I dont think the law is going to like us keeping them tied up down here.   What do you want to do momma.  Paul asked.   Take the backhoe down to the school and dig up a hole big enough to stuff both of them.  At least six to ten feet deep.  I think there is some groundwater issues down there so if you hit a muddy spot, stop.   What? Youre going to kill us for trespassing? It wasnt even posted!  Were beyond that now, Momma replied.  My boy pretty much fucked up your fate, probably should have let you go back then, but what is done is done.  No going back now.   Wait, can we work up a deal? Judd asked.   Maybe, what do you have in mind?  Ill give you as much blow as I can, and you can sell it.   What about her? Momma asked.  What does she have I can sell?  Im not attached to her, I dont care, Judd replied.   What! Lisa yelled from the hall.  Youre going to let her kill me?  You make your own deal! Im just a photographer, Judd replied.   Nice, Momma said.  I dont know what I can do with the girl, but Im sure I can come up with something.  Maybe a webcam girl, or something like that.   So its a deal? Judd asked.   Momma walked over to the desk where the computer sets and pulled a cup out of a drawer, she put the cup on the floor next to Judds face and said, You fill that tonight and Ill see what I can do.   You need to untie me, Judd replied.   You only need one hand, Paul will untie that, the other one stays where it is.  As long as you're filling cups, you stay out of the pit.       An hour later Judd was trying his best to get the job done, it was then he realized that getting his blow into a cup with one hand would be next to impossible.  He yelled out to whoever would listen, Hey! I need help here!  Momma stepped into the room wearing only her bra.  She was amazingly fit and tight.  What do you need honey? she asked.   How am I supposed to get my blow into the cup? It keeps tipping over.   Maybe I could tape the cup to the floor? she asked in a prim and proper manner.   Can you just hold it? he asked.   That would work for now, but I cant always be around to hold your cup.   I just need you this one time, to show you Im serious.  If you can hold it for five minutes, Ill be done.   Momma sat on the floor and crossed her legs holding the cup for Judd.  She watched patiently as he stroked back and forth trying to orgasm.  It was awkward but he knew he could get it done.  Stroke after stroke he brought himself closer till he blew his wad and shot into the cup.   Very nice, thats about ten milliliters, you might need to do that three times a day to keep up with my boy.   Ill do my best, Judd said taking a break.   Momma leaned back and spread her legs showing her shaved pussy off to Judd.  What do you think? Could I pass for thirty?  Judd stared at her pussy lips and said, Yeah, I bet you could.   Oh, youre just saying that, she replied fishing for compliments.   No, youre pretty smooth, not a lot of wrinkles.   Would you eat this pussy?  Now? he asked.   No silly, in general.  If you were at a party, and I came up to you and spread wide and asked you to eat me, what would you say?  Id say yes, Judd replied.   Youre just saying that because I have you tied up, she said with a grin.   No, really, thats a nice pussy, Id love to spend an hour with it.   Maybe sometime, Momma replied, Ill make it a special treat for you.   Do you have any daughters?  Why do you ask? You said my pussy was good enough for you.   I know, but if your pussy is that awesome at your age, Id love to see. . .   Before Judd could finish his sentence, Momma slapped him across the face and kicked him with her bare foot.  My pussy is the only pussy youll see, you got that?  What about Lisa?  Shes upstairs, I put her to work.   Doing what? Shes tied up.   House cleaning, Paul is watching her, he has a gun.   Great, I bet he loves that.   What do you mean?  He jerks off to porn all day, I bet he enjoys a real woman once and a while.   Hes not jerking off to her, Im the queen around here.        3   Diner      Anne Marie, Lisas mother, punched the keys on the cash register at the Holy Smokes diner.  She did the day shift and wore an apron that covered just below her short shorts.  For a woman of fifty two, she was hot.  She handed the change back to the customer and proceeded back to the counter where she was chatting with two men from the local rock quarry.   Can you suck your own tit? one of the men asked.  His name was Ed and he was gross.   Anne unbuttoned her blouse and pulled out her right breast.  She gave it a tug and pulled it up to her mouth where she gave it a little suck.  Yeah, I think so, she replied.  She left her breast hanging out of her shirt while she adjusted her apron.   Youre a pretty awesome lady, Ed said.  Can I touch it?  Thirty bucks and you can suck on it during my break, she said.   Does it bother you that the customers can see your boob hanging out? Ed asked.   No, I just tell them Im breast feeding, theyre pretty stupid anyway.   Think so?  Yeah, half the food we serve is stuff we got back on the plate ten minutes before.  We shuffle it around and serve it again.   Thats fucking gross, do you do that to me?  Yeah, all the time, if I didnt tell you, you wouldnt know.   The other man, Frank chimed in.  Is that a mole on your boob?  Anne looked down at her boob and pushed it around, no, thats something from the fryer, and flicked it off.   Why do you have crap on your boob from the kitchen?  I was fucking the delivery guy an hour ago, must have rubbed my tit on the stove.  Good thing I didnt get burned.   You really get around dont you? Frank asked.   Pretty much, waitressing dont pay shit, got to make it up somewhere.   You charged the delivery guy?  He pays me in food, he drops a load in me, and then drops a load from his truck in my cooler.   So hes ripping off his job to pay you for sex?  Yeah, whats wrong with that? Anne asked.   Nothing, what kind of food does he give you?  Mostly frozen burritos and steak, Anne replied.   What else do you do for money?  Im pretty lazy so mostly sex.  I can fuck three guys over my lunch hour.   How much do you charge?  Twenty bucks a load, condom of course.   How much without a condom?  I wont do bareback, Im not getting and STDs  Not even in the butt?  Ill do butt, but with a condom, and thats fifty bucks.    How much for a blow job?  Twenty.   Hand job?  Ten.   See you naked?  Two fifty.  Anne replied.   How much do you make working here at the diner?  Oh, about sixty bucks a day with tips.   How much do you take home with the extras?  On a good day, four hundred.   So why work here? You can get a street corner for free.   Theres no respect in working a street corner.   Hey, wheres Lisa? Shes usually around here by now.   Fuck I dont know, shes an adult.   What an awesome mom you are, Ed said.   Fuck you, Anne snapped back.   No thanks, I dont get paid till Friday, he said with a chuckle.   Anne heard a ding from behind her and grabbed two plates from the kitchen.  She set one plate in front of each man.  Here you go boys, she said.   Is this new or did this come off somebody elses old plate? Ed asked.   Whats the difference? she asked.   I want to know, Ed asked.   Anne turned around and yelled through the window back to the kitchen.  Hey Jack, are these new?  Ed heard a muffled voice and watched Anne turn back to him.   No, both of these are old, now eat, she said.   How much of it is old? The bun looks new.   It is new, now eat.   What if the guy who had this first had herpes?  You get herpes from butt fucking apes, not eating hamburgers, now dont worry about it.   How do you know?  I saw it on the Discovery channel, or some science show, I cant remember.  As long as you dont try to fuck it or stick it in your butt youll be fine.   Is that gravy or slobber?  Anne leaned over and pushed the sauce around with a fork.  Im guessing barbecue sauce with a little mucus mixed in.   Ed gagged a little and pushed the plate away.  I cant eat that, he said swallowing hard.   Have you ever eaten a whores pussy? Anne asked.   Yes, Ed replied.   Did you watch her wash it first?  No.   Well I bet her pussy was a lot worse than this burger.   Yeah, you got a point I guess.       Then from the front of the diner a large silhouette walked through the door and waddled its way over to the three chatting at the counter.  It was Sheriff Axl Jackson, two hundred and eighty pounds of pure asshole.  Anne, where is that piece of shit daughter of yours? he asked taking off his mirror sunglasses.   Which one? Lisa or Trish?  The one with the rainbow tattoo on her coochie,  Thats Lisa, how do you know she has a rainbow tattoo down there?  I pulled her over once, did a strip search, had to use my night stick on her.  She liked it a little too much if you ask me.   I dont know where she is, why do you ask? Anne asked.   Somebody reported her and some guy are taking nude pictures out in the country, do you know anything about that? the sheriff asked.   No, she didnt say anything to me, whos taking the pictures?  I dont know, I was hoping you could tell me.   Is there something wrong? I mean, is she flashing kids or something?  I dont know about you, but where I come from this kind of behavior is looked down upon.   Sheriff, we both came from here, you were in the class ahead of me in high school.   The sheriff leaned in close and looked down at Annes exposed tit.  Whats this? he asked in a condescending tone.   Its a tit, ever seen one before? Anne replied.   Why is it hanging out here for everyone to see?  I was giving out free creamer with the coffee, what it is to ya? she snapped back.   Id advise you put that thing back where it belongs he said calm and cool.  I dont need a disturbance today, Ive got some raging hemorrhoids.   Ill put it back when these guys leave, they still have coffee in their cups.   The sheriff leaned back and put all his weight on an empty barstool.  If that wannabe pornstar daughter of yours comes back, call me, I want to know what shes doing.   Fine, Anne said and watched the sheriff waddle his way back outside.   What a fuck head, Ed said.  Can I get some cream for my coffee?  Anne grabbed a packet of creamer and tossed it to Ed, You want creamer, use that, she replied tucking her tit back into her bra.  If you want extra, you gotta pay.   Frank pulled out his wallet and poked around.  I got two twenties, what will that get me?  Im not on break, Anne replied.   Youll pass up forty bucks?  I get my lunch at one, come back then.   This is my lunch break, I cant come back at one, and its either now or never.   Anne poked around the condiments carrier and looked around the room.  For noon it was dead.  Maybe she could work in something.  Ok, I can give you a blowjob until someone walks in for lunch.   Im not paying for that, you might not finish.   Best I can do.   What about when you get off work?  My husband picks me up at five.   Youre married? Does he know you do this?  He got me the job, he calls himself my pimp.   Holy buckets of fuck, Frank said.  So he wont mind if we do it in the back of your car while he waits?  Probably not, he has a new compound bow hes been looking at.  Im sure he could use the money.   So meet you back here at five? Frank asked.   Sure, but if youre not here, Im not waiting for you.  I dont do flakes.  Just then her phone rang.  Its him, hold on.  For the next few minutes Frank sat back and waited as Anne talked to her husband.  Then she hung up the phone.   Whats up? Frank asked.   He wants to know where Lisa is, shes his daddys girl.   Did you ask him about five oclock?  No, I forgot, but it will be fine, bring your money and meet me here.  You get fifteen minutes with me, has to be with a condom.        4   Toby      Lisa stood at the side of a small river, naked and alone.  She managed to escape from Paul who wasnt paying attention to what he was doing.  He was busy in the bathroom putting lotion on his dick.  Jerking off twice a day every day really can cause skin breakdown.  She was lost and trying to find a road but now was trapped between Mommas house and the river.  She could see the road across the river, but didnt want to get in and try to wade to the other side.  Then she heard a small voice.   What are you doing? the voice said.   Lisa didnt see anything and for a moment thought she was hearing things.   Do you need help? the voice said.   This time Lisa looked down and saw what she thought was a beaver looking up at her.  Are you talking to me? she asked.   Yes, youre the only one here, the beaver replied.   Why yes, I am trying to get across the river, she replied.   I know a place where you can get across, the beaver said.  Its about a quarter mile up river.   Ok, I have a question first though,  What?  Are you a beaver? she asked.   I get that a lot, yes, Im a beaver, the beaver replied.   I was wondering if you were just a giant rat, Lisa said.   I do think Im a member of the rodent family, not sure, I failed biology class.   You went to school? Lisa asked.   Yeah, community college.  Was going to get my bachelors but I got sick of school.   I didnt go to college at all, Lisa said.  Im not the academic type.   So what do you want to do with your life? the beaver asked.   I thought Id give modeling a shot, maybe porn, Lisa replied.   Id watch out for that if I were you, some modeling can be a scam.   I know, I did a lot of reading on it, Im being careful.  I hired my own photographer so they wouldnt try to sell me headshots.   The beaver looked Lisa up and down.  You got a nice face, but you dont really have the hips to be a model.  You need more curves.  And your nipples? Sort of odd looking, not sure Ive ever seen anything like those before.  Sort of like fried apples with peas stuck to them.   I can specialize, you know they have hand models, and other types, Lisa said.   Yeah, you could model hair coloring, or make up I suppose.  I dont think lingerie is for you.  Although I like your feet.   Thanks, Ive never got a compliment on my feet before, Lisa said looking at her toes.   So, you want to get to the other side? the beaver asked.   Yes, can you show me?  Yeah, this would be easier if you picked me up, the beaver said.   No problem, Lisa said scooping up the beaver.  She held it in her arms at waist level like a baby.  Which way? she asked.   Head in the direction youre standing and watch for stickers, this place is full of them.   Lisa headed off in the direction the beaver told her and together they bounced along trying to avoid the stickers on the ground.  So how long have you lived here? Lisa asked.   Oh, about two years now, the beaver replied.  Not a bad place to live.   You like the country?  Yes, better than town, traffic sucks for a small place.   Do you have a wife, kids?  I had a girlfriend but shes gone. . .   What happened?  She met another beaver and left me, hard to talk about.   Thats ok, you dont have too,  No, no, I really should or Ill never get over it.   If you want,  Ok, well, one day I come home and get into my lodge when I see this big furry brown fuck head banging my girlfriend on the couch.  I flip out and start ripping this guy apart when my bitch girlfriend pops in and starts defending him.  She tells me she never loved me and to get the hell out of her house.   What did you do?  I killed them both and left them for the coyotes.   I like that, you seem to be a man of conviction.   Nobody fucks with me, nobody, the beaver replied.  Look up ahead, you can see the crossing coming up.   Lisa looked and saw a strip of land that led out into the river to a small opening.  Since the spot where the river ran was narrow, it was also fast moving with rapids and white water.  I cant cross there, the waters too fast!  Oh bullshit, you can make it, hold onto the rocks as you go, its only twenty feet or so.   Twenty feet of a fucking flood, Ill fall on the rocks and be killed!  Ill walk you through it, it will be a breeze, trust me.   Lisa walked onto the strip of land and over to the rapids and looked at the white water splash and flow over the rocks.  No fucking way, Id be better off walking back to the farmhouse.   You know theyll string you up and skin you for your hide dont you? Those are crazy fuckers back there.  Momma and her boy.   No way!  Yep, you better get to crossing that river before they send the dogs after you.  They dont take kindly to their catch getting away, the beaver said.   Can I ask you a question? Lisa asked.   Sure,  Whats your name?  Toby Wheatfarmer, the beaver replied.   Thats pretty fucked up, Lisa said.   You dont like Toby?  No, I dont like Wheatfarmer, sounds hick.   Whats your name? the beaver asked.   Lisa Marie, Lisa replied.   Not bad, you look more like a Cindy or an Agnes, the beaver replied.   Ok, Toby, get me across that stream, I dont want to be skinned.   Ok, all you have to do is step lightly, hold onto the rocks and slowly make your way across the stream.  Just make sure you dont knock me off your back.   Youre a beaver, you can swim mister.   I dont like swimming, Id rather ride.   Youre a beaver, swimming is what you do.   Thats profiling and you know it! Toby snapped back.   What are you going to do? Stick your claws into my back? And fuck, you weigh like fifty pounds!  Fine! Go by yourself, last time I ever help you, Toby said with his best passive aggressive snark.   Lisa stood looking down at Toby feeling guilty.  Her leg hair waving in the cool breeze.   You really need to wax your beaver you know, that thing needs work.   Lisa looked down between her legs and nodded her head in agreement.  Yeah, I was going to get it waxed but theres nobody in town that does that and Im not going to buy some kit and do it myself.   Well anyway, lets get going, Toby said motioning to the rapids.   Lisa walked over to the edge of the water followed by Toby who scrambled over the way beavers do.   Put your foot in the water, Toby said.   Lisa put her toe in the water and was surprised at how warm it was.  She pressed down until she hit solid ground with water splashing around her leg.   See, its not all that bad, grab the first big rock you see.   Lisa squatted down and reached for a big rock.  It seemed stable so she put her other foot in the water.  It met solid ground as well.  A few more steps and she was a third of the way across the stream.  Just then she felt something grab her ankle and tug, she screamed a shriek and then was pulled up stream and submerged.   Toby watched in shock as the woman he had just met a half hour ago was now gone, somewhere under the water probably drowning.  Why did she go upstream instead of downstream? Toby didnt have time to worry about it, he knew he had to get to her before she was dead.  Taking off in a dead run, Toby dove in the water looking for Lisa.  With his beaver swimming ability, he darted from side to side looking for her, then he saw her being pulled deep into a cave and swam down to save her.   The swift moving water made rescue difficult, and Toby couldnt understand what forces were pulling her down, but he managed to catch up with her and get pulled into a cave which led into a tunnel.  Once in the tunnel, a different current swept them both deep inside, into darkness where they traveled an unknown distance until they saw light above and the current subsided.  Almost out of air, the two surfaced into someones outside swimming pool.   Oh my God! Lisa yelled out of breath.   Toby swam to the edge of the pool and got out.  He looked around and saw a very nice back yard with a manicured lawn and gas grill.  There were no other people around except for Lisa who was now crawling out of the pool.   Are you alright? Toby asked.   Give me a second, Lisa said bent over taking deep breaths.  Her boobs hung down and swung back and forth.  Yeah, Im ok, what was that we went through? she asked.   I have no fucking clue, Toby replied.  Must have been an old lava tube or something.   Lava tube? I dont think this area was ever volcanic.   Question is, why did it lead to this pool? Toby asked.   Lisa stood upright and put her hands on her wide hips.  She looked at the house and said, Maybe we should ask the owners.   Are you sure? I dont like this, I think we should go to the police, Toby said.   Maybe, ok, lets do that, she said and they both took off walking around the side of the house towards the front.  It was there they spied a mail truck delivering the mail.  Lets ask him, Lisa said and she took off in a run, boobs flopping all over the place.  Hey, hold up! she said running over to the delivery guy.   What can I do for you? the delivery guy said looking at Lisas naked body.   We just came through some sort of tunnel and landed in this guys pool, we need help getting back, can you help us? Lisa asked.  By now Toby had caught up and was standing next to Lisas leg.   Where are you from young lady?  Were from Sparksville, isnt this Sparksville? she asked looking around.  The landscape wasnt familiar.   No, no, this is Lancaster, the delivery man replied.   I dont think Ive ever heard of Lancaster before.   Ive been in the delivery business for years and I dont think Ive ever heard of Sparksville either.   Well holy buckets of shit, Toby said.   Whos your friend down there? the delivery guy asked.   Hes my beaver, Lisa replied.  His name is Toby.   Hi Toby, the delivery man said.   What are you delivering? Toby asked making conversation.   The delivery man looked at the package in his hand and read the contents.  Human sperm, he said aloud.   Human sperm? Thats pretty fucked up, Lisa said.  I met a lady that was selling her sons sperm online, whats the return address?  The delivery guy looked all around and couldnt find a return address.  Doesnt say, he said.   Wouldnt it be weird if the sperm in that package came from the same house I was tied up in? Lisa asked.   You were tied up? the delivery man asked.   Yes, I was kidnapped by some creepy guys at a photo shoot.  One of the guys had to jerk off into a cup twice a day so his mother could sell it online.   Thats a pretty fanciful story young lady, the delivery man said.   Its true, ask my beaver.   Which one? the delivery man asked.   Toby, my other one doesnt talk, Lisa replied.   Is that true? the delivery man asked Toby.   Fuck I dont know, I wasnt there, I met her at the river.  For all I know shes some freaking psycho, Toby said.   Well, anyway, the delivery guy said, I need to get moving on, I have packages to deliver.  You might consider putting some clothes on Miss, some folks might not take kindly to a naked woman walking around town with her beaver hanging out.   I would if I could, but I dont have any money to buy clothes.   The delivery man reached in his pocket and pulled out some cash, he counted it, Heres seven dollars that should get you a t-shirt and a pair of panties.   You want me to walk into a department store naked and buy clothes? Lisa asked.   Well, your other option would be to break into a house and steal some I guess.   Could you go in the store and buy them for me and bring them out? Lisa asked.   Maam, I have a job to do, Im already late.  If you werent so pretty, Id of ditched you a long time ago.  Ask your beaver to do it for you.   I dont think they let rodents into department stores, Lisa replied.  And I dont think he can hold the money in his little hands.   Well, I guess youre fucked then, have a good day, the delivery man said and off he went in his truck to the next house.        5   Anal lube      That evening Frank flaked and failed to show up for his five oclock blowjob, or fuck, or whatever they were going to do so Anne and her husband Roger left for home.  While in the car, Anne decided she wanted to stop at the dollar store and pick up some stuff.  Roger hated shopping but he was driving and had to go.  Anne even made Frank go inside.   Once inside, Anne pulled frank into the womens clothing section and started asking questions.  Honey, do you think this bra is sexy? she asked pulling one off the rack.   I dont know, they all look the same to me, Roger replied.   How about this one? she said pulling a pink one down off the hook.   Yeah, thats nice.   Is there something wrong Roger?  No, I just dont like shopping, thats all.   You havent gone queer on me have you? Anne asked.   What?  Im showing you bras and you act like were looking at shelf paper, this stuff should turn you on.   Anne, Ive seen you naked for twenty five years, its not like youre an eighteen year old at the strip joint hanging her tits above me trying to get a dollar from me.  Ive seen you, a lot.   I think youve gone queer, no man acts like this unless hes been taking cocks up the ass.   Im not queer! Roger yelled across the store.  I like pussy! Im just tired of yours!  Oh my fucking God! Anne yelled back.  Are you saying Im gross?  Roger stood there fuming mad trying not to explode.  Then he exploded.  You have ass fat so bad that the cheese factory called asking to buy my supply.  Youre tits are so saggy they hang over your belly button.  Sometimes when you give me head, I swear youre scraping me with your dentures, now back off! Roger yelled.   I dont have dentures! Anne yelled back.   Maybe not, but your tits look like flat tires and feel like them too.  I cant stand to look at you when you come out of the shower.  I know you stand there naked trying to get me to look at you, you drop your towel so many times I swear you have some neurological disease.  When you bend over, your beaver hair looks like a wig you tied down there to cover your wrinkled up pussy lips.   If Im so gross, why do so many guys want to fuck me? Anne barked back.   Because those guys are sick and tired of their flabby gross wives.  Hell, half of them dont have wives and would fuck a dog in heat if they had the chance.  Now get your fucking bra and lets get the fuck out of here.   No, were not finished yet, I swear youre a queer and I can prove it.   You cant prove shit, Roger said crossing his arms.   I know what you do when Im at work, you say youre down at the shop, but Ive found mens underwear under our bed, and it isnt yours.   Bullshit, Roger replied knowing he was busted.   Really? And what about the anal lube you hide in your bedside table? You dont use that on me!  I use it for my feet, keeps them soft, Roger replied lying out his ass, no pun intended.  He began to sweat.   And one more thing, I got on your phone when you were sleeping, I read your texts from your boyfriend asking him how much he liked you licking his asshole.  You never licked my asshole!  That wasnt a guy that was a woman.   Oh, like that makes it better, even if that were true, that just proves youve been cheating on me.   You have sex with other guys all the time!  Because you want me too! I get paid to fuck those guys, you spend that money on your hobbies! Of which now I see fucking guys is one!  I think youre drunk, or stoned, I never cheated on you and I dont have sex with men.   Whatever, Anne replied.  When we get home youre fucking the shit out of me, if youre not queer, you better pound me till I cant walk straight.   Ill pound you right here, Roger said.  He walked over to Anne, spun her around and undid her pants, pulled them down and began to stroke her between the legs in full view of the customers who had gathered to hear them yell at each other.  What the fuck are you looking at? Roger yelled to the onlookers, it did nothing to make them go away.   Roger then slid Annes panties to the floor and whipped out his dick.  He bend her over and tried to shove it inside her but she was dry.  Can someone get me some pussy lube please? he asked the crowd.   One second, a clerk yelled and Roger stood there hoping his boner would last.  In a minute the clerk brought a box of sex lube and handed it to Roger.  Can you open it? he asked.  My hands are full.   The clerk opened the box and pulled out the lube, she unscrewed the cap and poured some into Rogerss hand.  By now Anne was getting sore from bending over and Rogers boner was almost gone.  He quickly rubbed some on his cock and shoved it inside with an astounding whomp that send Annes head crashing into a sunglasses display case.   Once inside, Roger pumped Anne as fast and hard as he could until he lost his erection and his dick fell out.   What happened? someone from the crowd asked.   He lost it, someone else replied.   Hes a queer, Anne said and stood upright.  He cant keep a boner unless the other one has one too.   Just then a man stepped forward, a large man with hair like an ape.  Is that right? Are you queer? If so, Id hate to see you waste that lube.   Roger looked at the man and his dick began to get stiff again.  You up for it? Roger asked to Annes shock and horror.   I was right! Anne yelled.   Shut the fuck up, Roger said and motioned for the stranger with the hairy body to come closer.  The man stood before Roger and grabbed his cock and began to stroke it rock hard.   You want it in the butt or the mouth? the stranger asked.   The butt, Roger replied and watched the stranger pull down his pants and underwear exposing his ripe hairy ass.  Roger lit up like a light bulb and rammed his cock into the strangers ass like a freight train hitting a wall of bunnies.  The crowd watched in enthusiastic excitement as these two guys engaged in a brutal homosexual sex fest.  In a few minutes, Roger climaxed, pulled out his cock and shot his load all over the back of the stranger he had just met.  Once spent, his dick went limp and he had to sit down and recover.   That was the sickest fucking thing Ive ever seen, Anne said standing in the crowd still half naked.  You used to do that to me.   Yeah, what a waste that was, Roger said.  We need a cleanup on aisle nine, Roger said to the clerk.  And put that lube up at the counter, Ill pay for it when I get this cleaned up.       Ten minutes later, Roger and Anne were back in the car heading home.  Anne crossed her arms and acted like a bitch.   What the fuck is wrong now? Roger asked.   Are you kidding me? You fucked some guy in a store in front of strangers.  You know how humiliating that is?  No, and I dont care.   I want a divorce, Anne said under her breath.   Really? After all these years you want to get a divorce? You get all the action you want on the side, you have a house, you have all the shit you want, and now you want a divorce because I decided I like cock better than your raggy old hole?  Its about love Roger, not sex.   Bullshit, you think I loved that guy? All he was to me was a rock solid piece of ass.  Youre the only woman I ever loved.  Youre just pissed because I did it in public.   Its not him, its the other guys youve been bringing into our bed.   Oh shit, those guys are a dime a dozen, I pay them ten bucks for an hour.  I dont know most of them at all.   You pay for it? Those guys are prostitutes? What kind of diseases are you bringing into our house? Do you use a condom?  No, I dont use a condom, Im not putting a trash bag on my cock, I cant feel their sweet assholes that way.   I am so grossed out now, you cant imagine, Anne said.   If that grosses you out, you should see us make out.  Now thats fucking awesome.  Two hot men in a steamy make out session stroking each others rock hard cocks.   Im going to throw up, Anne said.   Youve stroked my cock a time or two, Roger said.   Thats different, Im your wife, and Im a woman!  Roger shook his head in disgust.  Either way, I dont have an emotional attachment to those guys, they just come over at lunch and take it in the ass.   Thats why you cant come visit me on your lunch hour? Youre too busy ass fucking prostitutes?  Yeah, pretty much.   Is that why we cant afford to go on vacations? You spend all our money, the money I bring home, on men? Did you even buy that bow you said you were going to buy?  Guilty, Roger replied, No, I spent it on three guys and a massage.   You bastard! Anne said.  I hate you! and began to cry.   I love you Anne, I may fuck other men, but you are the only woman for me.   What good is loving me if you cant have sex with me? I might as well be your grandma, you dont fuck her either, or do you? Oh, I forgot, you like the dudes.   Its just sex, I love you! Roger barked back.   Anne shook her head, kept her arms crossed and looked out the passenger side window as they drove home.  Then she noticed the car slowing down and pulling over.  What are you doing? she asked.   Its Dan, I want to see if he can come over for lunch tomorrow, Roger replied.   Lunch? Is that a code word?  Pretty much, Roger replied.   Is Dan a hooker?  Yeah, now be quiet for a minute.   Roger stopped the car and waved Dan over to the window.   Dan approached and leaned into the drivers window.  Whats up? Dan asked.   Hey, you free for lunch tomorrow? Roger asked.   Whos the lady? Dan asked.   My wife.   You letting her in on your little secret?  Yeah, she figured it out.   She cool with it?  Anne reached into the glove box and pulled out the loaded pistol she knew Roger kept there.  She aimed it at Dan and shot him in the face scaring the shit out of Roger who didnt see it coming.   What the fuck? Roger yelled and grabbed for the gun.  Anne held it close and pointed it at Rogers face.  You think youre going to hook up with me in the car? Its bad enough you put on a fag fuck fest for the whole town back there, but youre not hooking up with your boy toys while Im in the car.   Hold on, I don't think this was going to be such a big deal, Roger said wiping Dans brains off his face.   Anne pushed the gun into Rogers crotch and shoved hard.  I should shoot your pecker off right now, she said gritting her teeth.  What do you think about that gay boy?  Calm down Anne, Roger said, You just killed a man, dont make this worse.   How much worse can it get?  A lot worse.   Tell me Roger, how much worse?  Youre just fucking with me now, stop this and put the gun back in the glove box.   Ive gone too far Roger, theres no going back.  I think youre going to lose your dick, what do you think about that? Before Roger could answer, she pulled the trigger and shot him in the cock.  He lunged forward in shock and pain while she reeled back and aimed the gun at his head.  How was that? she asked.   Roger looked at his hand and saw it was covered in blood.  It hurt, but the shock kept much of the pain at bay, for now.  He reached over and grabbed Anne by the neck and tried to choke her but before he could she put a bullet in his eye and killed him.  Looking down at Roger, she shrugged her shoulders and put the gun back in the glove box.  She knew it would only be a while before the cops showed up so she got out of the car and decided to take a walk.  Sure shed be cited for leaving the scene of a crime, but what the fuck, she had just shot two guys in less than five minutes and there wasnt much she could do now.  She was pretty much fucked and looking a prison time or lethal injection.   For the next few minutes, she was going to enjoy the last freedom she had and breathe fresh air, the kind you dont find in a prison cell.  At least she got what she wanted, and that was what was most important.  Now if she could only contact her daughters.        6   LeRoy      Paul! Wheres the girl? Momma yelled from the living room.   Paul was busy scrambling around the house looking for her before his mother realized she was gone, now he was fucked.  I dont know, I cant find her, he yelled back from the laundry room.   What? get your ass in here right now! She shouted.   Paul ran into the living room huffing and puffing, Sorry Momma, she got loose somehow.   You fucking idiot, you had one job to do and you botched it.  How long has she been gone? Momma asked.   About an hour, maybe two, Paul replied.   Momma shook her head in disgust and bit her lip thinking of what to do now.  We got to get out of here, before the police show up.   Yes Momma, I think youre right.   Of course Im right, get the car loaded and take care of that guy in the basement.   What do you want me to do with him? Paul asked.   Kill him, Momma replied.   Oh no Momma, I cant kill him that would be wrong.   You kidnapped him that was wrong, just finish the job!  No, I wont, Paul replied.   Momma stomped her feet and made a fist, acting like a child.  Fine, go load up the car, Ill be out there in fifteen minutes!  What are you going to do with him? Paul asked.   I guess were taking him with us, Momma replied in disgust.       A half an hour later the car was heading down the highway with Momma in the passenger seat, Paul driving and Judd tied up in the back seat.  Then they came up to a construction site and a detour.  Fuck, I hate these things! Paul said leaning back in his seat.  They take fucking forever.   Whatever you do, dont make a scene, we cant let anyone know that guy is in the back, Momma said.   They pulled up behind a long line of stopped cars and Paul put the vehicle in park.  It was going to be a while before they could get moving again, then they heard a siren.  What the hell? Paul said, I wonder what thats all about?  Then a state patrol car pulled up alongside Paul and parked with the lights still on.  An officer got out of the car and approached Pauls door.  He rolled down the window and said, Whats wrong officer?  Step out of the car, now, the officer said firmly.   Paul was freaked out, but got out of the car like the officer asked.   Turn around and put your hands on the car, the officer stated.  Paul complied.   Whats wrong officer? Paul asked.   Once the cuffs were on, the officer pulled Paul to the back of the car where a man was crushed into the trunk hanging dead like a ragdoll.  Holy shit! Its LeRoy!  Whos LeRoy? the officer asked.   Hes our hired hand, how the fuck did he get smashed into the trunk? Paul asked.  Then it came to him.  Holy shit, he said.  Thats what that bump was.   What bump? the officer asked.   When I backed the car into the garage I felt a bump, I thought I ran over a cat or something.  Paul said.   You admit you did this? the officer asked.   Yeah, but it was an accident, I didnt know he was in the garage.   He didnt call for help or anything?  He might of, I had the radio on sort of loud.   Do you know how much force it would take to crush a man into a trunk like that? the officer asked.   No, do you? Paul replied.   Then Momma called out from inside the car, Whats going on? she asked.   Its LeRoy Momma, I killed him on accident, hes stuck in the trunk, Paul yelled.   Momma got out of the car and walked to the rear where she saw LeRoys smashed and bloody body hanging from the indentation he made when crushed against the garage wall.  Oh Paul, now look what youve done, Momma said.   Im sorry Momma, I didnt see him.   Obviously, Momma replied.   The officer interrupted and said, There is a blood trail thirty miles long all along the highway.  We have to call in a hazmat crew to clean this up.   Do you want me to help clean it up? Paul asked.   No, youre under arrest for homicide, the officer replied.   Homicide? It was an accident, it was like running over a dog.  I didnt know he was in the garage, he was probably taking a nap on the workbench or something.   Thats for the judge to decide, now do you have anything on your body that might poke me? The officer asked.   I got a pocket knife and a pair of fingernail clippers, Paul replied.  Do you need your nails clipped?  Im going to read you your rights, the officer stated.  You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, anything you say can and will be used in a court of law, if you are unable to afford an attorney one will be appointed for you, do you understand these rights as I have read them to you? the officer asked.   I wasnt silent in the first place so how can I remain silent? Paul asked.   From this point onward, the officer replied.   But what about what I said before you read me my rights?  Youre pretty much fucked, you volunteered that information, the officer replied.   Momma stepped over the puddle of blood on the asphalt and approached Paul.  Dont worry Paul, Momma will get you a lawyer.   But Momma, it was an accident, I didnt mean to kill LeRoy.   I know, it will be alright.   The officer led Paul to the patrol car and put him in the back.  The officer then walked back over to the car to ask more questions.  Maam, is this your car? he asked.   Yes, it belongs to me, why?  I need to see your license and registration.   Tell you what, what if I give you a blow job right here and we forget about the whole thing? Momma asked.   Sorry Maam, Im no longer able to take sexual favors in exchange for letting people go.   I got twenty dollars, she stated.   I dont take bribes under a hundred bucks, the officer replied.   Then what can I do to make you look the other way? I need to get going.   You dont have another eighty dollars? the officer asked.   No, are you sure you wont take a blow job? Its worth eighty dollars.   They have us on video, if they saw that, Id get my ass in trouble, the officer replied.   But wont you get in trouble if they see you take cash from me?  Never happened before.   What if I show you my tits?  Sorry, wont work.   Then what are you going to do with me? Momma asked.   Since you werent driving, well impound the car for evidence.  Youll have to arrange for someone to come pick you up.   Momma had no fucking clue how she was going to explain Judd in the back seat.  She needed a plan to keep the car from being impounded.  Or at least how to explain Judd.   Then the officer took a look in the backseat and saw a man lying there tied up.  Excuse me, whats going on here? he asked.   Oh, thats Burt, hes my retarded son, we have to tie him up or hell try to eat his hair.   That sucks, hate to be you, how old is he? the officer asked.   Twenty four, been like that since he ate some charcoal briquettes at camp back when he was six years old.  They had lighter fluid on them, fucked up his brain pretty bad.   Yeah, ok, well, I got a tow truck coming to take the car, youll need to get him out soon.  Do you have a phone to call for a ride? the officer asked.   Im ninety miles from home, I dont have anyone I can call.   Not sure what to tell you then, just make sure you stay off the road and on the shoulder, the traffic around here is nuts.   Youre going to leave us stranded out here on the highway in the middle of nowhere? Momma asked.   I dont drive a taxi Maam, you need to arrange for your own ride.  With that said, the officer closed his notebook and got back in his car leaving Momma and Judd by themselves to wait for the tow truck.       Once the tow truck arrived, the driver got out and looked at LeRoy's smashed body hanging off the trunk.  How am I supposed to hook this up? the driver asked.  Ill get guts all over my chain.   Shouldn't there be a crime scene investigator here before you take the car away? Momma asked.   Fuck I dont know, the driver said.  I just haul them where they tell me too.   Can you give me a ride? Momma asked.   Like what kind of ride?  How many kinds of rides are there?  Like ride my cock? the driver asked with a grin.   No, a ride to a gas station, or someplace where I can get a car.   My service station rents cars, forty bucks a day, unlimited mileage, the driver said.   I only have twenty on me.   We have an ATM machine.   I left my purse at home, I dont have my cards.   Sorry, cant help you then, if you want to ride with me, itll cost you a hand job.   Hand job? Momma asked.   Yeah, usually I do it to myself while Im driving, but you can do it for me.  Its ten miles to my shop, usually charge sixty bucks for a tow, you get it for a hand job.   What does your boss think about this? Arent you losing money? Momma asked.   Id spend the money on a hand job anyway so it breaks even.  Takes out the middleman.   What makes you think I want to put my hand on your gross little pecker? Momma asked.   Taken aback, the tow truck driver got pissed and replied, Fuck you, you old bitch! Walk for all I care.   Now hold on, I think we can come to an agreement, I just dont like getting my hand dirty, is there anything else I can do to barter a ride from you?  Have you ever peed on anyone before? the tow truck driver asked.   Yes, many times.   You pee on me and its a deal.   When and where? Momma asked.   How about now, over in that ditch, the driver replied.   Sounds good, lets go, Momma said and the two walked over to the ditch.  Once off the shoulder of the highway, and in full view of the traffic backed up for the detour, the driver laid on the ground waiting for Momma to piss on him.  Momma pulled down her pants and panties and squatted so she could get a good aim.  Where do you want it? she asked.   On my face, he replied.   Momma used her fingers and spread her pussy lips wide and shot hot yellow piss all over the drivers face.  He made moaning sounds as she rocked back and forth spraying him from chin to forehead.  Once done, Momma stood up, pulled up her pants and snapped them.  She looked to the line of cars and waved to all the people who got the free show.  From the line of cars she heard a man yell, asking how much it cost to get that done.        7   Sauerkraut      Back at the gas station, the driver let the car down off the hook and met Momma at the back.   Body didnt fall off, she said.   Yep, stuck on pretty good, the driver said.   Who do I see about getting a rental?  Go in the business office, Bernice is there.   Momma walked to the front door and looked at the sign above, it read, Vamp auto service and repair in big red letters.  Interesting, she said under her breath and walked inside.  At the counter stood a hunched over woman, old but not that old, with wrinkled skin and bright red lipstick.   What can I do for you honey? Bernice asked.   I need a rental while my car is being fixed, and I need a body removed from my trunk.  I mean the outside of the trunk, not inside.   I know, Jeb called and told me all about it, the funeral home will be here soon to pry that dead fucker off your car.   Good, I do have one problem though, I left my purse at home and dont have any cash.   That is a problem, Bernice said tapping her fingers on the counter.  Rental is forty a day, mileage included, any way you can come up with that?  Im an hour from home, do you have a First National Bank in town?  Yes, but its past five, theyre closed.   I cant afford a hotel until they open tomorrow, Im fucked!  What about him? Bernice asked.   Who?  That guy coming through the door.   Momma turned around and saw Judd walking through the door, the driver had untied him and instead of running away, he came into the office.  You got any cash? Momma asked.   Surprised, Judd replied, I got about twelve dollars, why?  Fuck, I need money for a rental car.   Bernice chimed in, youll need more than forty, the car only has a little gas in it, and you have to put some in.   Now what? Momma asked out loud.   Maybe I could let you sleep in the back till morning when the bank opens, Bernice said.  You two would have to sleep on the floor, but you would have a roof over your head.   Momma thought for a second, Do you have a shower?  Theres a hose in the shop, you can wash off with that.   What about my hair?  You can go to the bank, get some cash and go to the salon for all I care, do you want to sleep in the back or not?  What do you think? Momma asked Judd.   For someone who had me tied up, I think youre asking the wrong person, I came in here to fuck you up.   What?  Judd lunged forward and grabbed Momma by her long grey hair and slammed her head down on the counter.  Thats for you tying me up! he said in rhythm as he pounded her up and down, blood splattered on the counter and onto Judds shirt.   Now hold up there mister, Bernice said.  Youre making a mess.   Judd looked to the old lady at the counter.  He saw she had blood in her white hair.  Oh, sorry, he said.  Do you have a washrag? he asked looking around with Mommas head still in his grasp.   I think shes dead, Bernice said.   Judd let go and Momma slid off the counter onto a heap on the floor.  Her eyes were closed, covered in blood, but she didnt look dead.  No, shes still breathing.   Bernice stumbled around the counter and got down on her knees examining Momma.  Yeah, shes still alive.  Then she bent over and started licking the blood off Mommas face.   What are you doing? Judd asked in disgust.   Bernice paused and looked up at Judd who was hovering above.  I dont want this to go to waste, she replied.   What are you? Some sort of vampire?  Did you read the sign above the door?  Judd had to stop for a moment and think, Yeah, it said, Vamps, Holy shit, youre a vampire?  Not just me, all of us here, its a family owned shop.  she replied.   That is really messed up, what about the rest of the town?  No, just us, we moved here back in the forties, most of the town are Polish.   You cant be Polish and a vampire at the same time?  Never thought about it, most of us are north European.  Lots of Danes in our past, thats why we are mostly blonde.  Im grey now, but I used to have nice blonde hair.  Do you mind if I finish before she wakes up?  No, go ahead, Judd said, do you have a cell phone charger? I need to make a call but my battery is dead.   Under the counter there is a cell phone cord, not sure it will fit your phone.   Judd walked around the counter, keeping out of the blood on the floor she was now lapping up and found the cord.  He plugged in his phone and it beeped.  Good, Ill let this charge for an hour, is there a place in town to eat? he asked.   Theres a Polish pizza place two blocks west, and next to that is a gas station, Bernice replied.   Judd left the building and headed down the street to the pizza place leaving the mess behind.  As he left, he saw the funeral guys prying the dead body off the back of the car in chunks.  They had to put the parts into a bag instead of placing it on a gurney like they wanted.       Ten minutes later, Judd was at the Polish pizza place sitting at a nice table looking at a menu.  What he saw looked like horse shit on a pizza crust.  Ozr woowy, Sztuka misa w sosie chrzanowym, Golonka w piwie, what the fuck is this? He thought in his inner monologue.  How can they put this on a crust? Most of it looked like pig knuckles or beef tongue.  Then a waitress approached the table.   Can I take your order? she asked.  She was cute in a Polish style short dress and high socks.   I think the word you are looking for is May not Can you can do anything you want, but I may not let you, he said with a flirty grin.   The girl looked annoyed and put her pen to her order pad.  May I take your order? she asked.   Do you have anything that doesnt look like it came out of the ass of a dead zebra? Judd asked.   Yes, if you like, I can get you just about anything you want, our cook is very good, she replied.   Good, what can I get for twelve dollars, and that includes the tip?  Oh, probably some grilled cheese, or maybe some chicken noodle soup.   Thats it? What if I give you your tip in the back room with my dick?  Lets see it first, she asked.   Judd unzipped his pants and showed the girl his little pecker.   No thanks, I have sausage in the back twice as big as that, this is a Polish restaurant.   Frustrated, Judd said, Grilled cheese, can I get the soup too? Will that bust my budget?  Yeah, I can do both, that wont leave much for a tip.   What if I man the sausage for you? I can do that, that way your hands will be free to do whatever.   Like what? Knit socks? she asked sardonically.   I dont know, Im just saying, it would be like you were getting nailed by a real man.   Youre not a real man?  Youre the one who didnt like my pecker, now is it a deal or not?  Ill have to ask my boyfriend first.   Yeah, like hed agree, Judd said in disgust.   No, hes the owner, hes pretty gross, he might say yes, but if I dont ask, hell cut me up and make soup out of me.   No, forget it, just give me the grilled cheese.   Now you got me going hot, you cant turn me down now! she said flashing Judd with an up skirt thong shot.   Judd had to do a double take it went by so fast.  Wait a second, I wasnt ready, can you do that again?  The waitress this time slowly pulled up her skirt, in front of all the customers and pushed her crotch into Judds face letting her skirt cover his head.  She then began to grind in a rhythm to the polka music playing over the restaurant speakers and moan.  After a few seconds, she pulled back and asked, How was that?  Why does it smell like sauerkraut? Judd asked.   Pissed, the young woman picked up a menu from the table and began to whack Judd across the face repeatedly.  The crowd got involved and began to cheer for the girl as Judd took a brutal beating.  The more the crowd got into it, the harder the girl hit Judd until he was ducking under the table, then the owner walked over.   What the fuck is going on here? he shouted.  He was a huge fat man, wearing all white and covered in food stains.   This guy said my pussy smelled like sauerkraut!  It does, the owner said.  I use it to keep my cock moist, we fucked an hour ago, I bet it wreaks of sauerkraut, and why does this guy know this? What are you doing?  He offered to tip me with his sausage, she replied.   So? the owner replied  Well, I dont know, he reached over and grabbed me and tried to eat me out, he tried to rape me!  Is that right? the owner asked the crowd watching the show.   A resounding yes was yelled and the owner got pissed.  He stormed off to the kitchen and returned with a huge butcher cleaver in his hand.  Ill kill that fucker, he said and kicked the table over exposing Judd underneath.   Shes lying! Judd yelled trying to save his ass.  She put her beaver in my face, I didnt do anything.   Thats not what my customers are saying, the owner said.   They just want to see you cut me up with that knife, they want blood!  The owner looked around the room and yelled, Is there anyone here who can back up this mans story!  A small voice called out, I can.   The owner looked to a small child, or what looked like a small child in a booster seat, it may have been a dwarf, it had facial hair.  She did it, I saw the whole thing.   Did what?  Shoved his face in her pussy, she tried the same thing to me yesterday, you might want to keep her on a short leash.   Is this true? the owner asked the waitress.   The waitress looked away and would not make eye contact with the owner, she crossed her arms, then her legs and avoided the question.  I think I smell something burning, she said.   Hearing that, the owner ran back to the kitchen where he found smoke rolling out of the pizza oven, five pizzas were burnt beyond repair.   Nice save, Judd said.   The waitress raised her skirt again and pulled down her thong exposing her hairy Polish pussy.  Actually, I use sauerkraut to douche with, she said with a grin and began to laugh.  Keeps my yeast infections in line.        8   Dog Kennel      Lisa walked along the side of the road taking small steps letting Toby keep up.  From the looks of it, they were in some sort of sub division heading towards the business part of Lancaster.  The sun was overhead and Lisa figured it was around noon, she was getting hungry and her stomach began to growl.   Im hungry, Lisa said.   Me too, Toby replied.   What do beavers eat?  Oh, I like leaves, the inside of bark and some twigs.   That sounds gross, Lisa said.  I want a hamburger.   How are you going to get a hamburger? No shoes, no shirt, and no service they say.   I dont know, maybe you could get one at a burger place and bring it out? Lisa replied.   I think you should spend that money on clothes, then you could get a job and buy all the food you want.   But Im hungry now, Lisa said.       Just then a car came down the street and slowed down, both Lisa and Toby took notice.  The car stopped and the passenger window rolled down with a buzz.  In the passenger seat was a large dark skinned man with black sunglasses and a lot of facial hair.  He looked like he had been out in the sun way too much.  Hey he said looking at Lisas tits.  How much?  How much for what? Lisa replied.   For sex baby, the man replied.   You think Im a prostitute? she asked.   Youre walking around naked with a beaver, what else should I think?  Im sorry, Im not a prostitute.   Just then Toby spoke up.  Hand job is twenty bucks.   Lisa looked down at the beaver in shock.  Twenty?  How much for a blow job? the man asked.   Toby replied, fifty bucks.   The stranger looked to the driver and they had a discussion.  He turned back and asked, How much for two, me and my friend here?  Toby looked at Lisa and gave her the look that said she needed to say the right thing.  She looked at the stranger and said, Seventy five.   Deal, the stranger said and motioned for her to get in the back seat.  Leave the beaver, he added.   No, hes my security, Lisa said.  He comes or no blow jobs.   Fine, the man said and Toby got in the back seat and sat next to Lisa.   Where are we going? Lisa asked.   Back to my place, the man said.   Can we do it in the car? Id rather not go to your place.   Not enough room, plus I want to take a shower first, the man said.   Lisa looked to Toby with scared disgust.  She swallowed hard and shook her head.   Whats wrong Missy, the man said.  You walk around naked in the street, I would think this would be a breeze.   Well actually, I lost my clothes after being kidnapped, Im not really a prostitute.   Kidnapped? That sucks, maybe we should take you to the cops, after the blow job that is.   I dont think that will work, this isnt my hometown, Im lost.   Where are you from?  Sparksville, she replied.   Never heard of it, how big is Sparksville?  About sixty thousand, Lisa replied.   Hard to lose a town that big.   Toby was feeling left out so he spoke up and asked, May I ask what you gentlemen do for a living?  I work construction when Im not high, and my friend here runs and illegal tattoo shop out of his moms basement, the stranger replied.  What about you?  Im a professional hand model, and my friend Lisa here is trying to get into the business herself.   Cool, my sisters a model.  Shes real skinny, like sick skinny, I think she does meth.   Are we getting close to your house? Lisa asked.   Yeah, two more blocks, hey, can I upgrade my blow job to a fuck? the driver asked not looking back.  Ill pay you ten extra.   Im not on birth control, Lisa replied.  And I dont trust condoms.   Shit, I had a vasectomy last year, dont need to condom, the driver replied.   Still, Id rather not, Lisa said.   Maybe she could take it in the butt for an extra ten? Toby asked.   Lisa heard Toby and elbowed him in the nuts.  I dont take it in the ass for nobody, not for any amount.   The driver slowed down and pulled up to the curb of a very run down shit hole house with an unmowed lawn and crap piled on the porch.  Sitting on a couch on the grass sat a large dog.  Here we are, the driver said to Lisas horror.   This is your place? she asked in shock.   No, its a friends house.   It looks like a druggie house, she said.   You wont be here but an hour, dont worry your little head off, the passenger said getting out of the car.   Lisa hesitated, but got out of the car followed by Toby.  She walked over the lawn to the sidewalk and stopped while the driver got out to lead the way.  Once to the porch, she noticed that there were dog food cans all over and the house smelled like old shit.   Whats wrong girl? the driver asked.   This place smells like a dog kennel, she replied.   I got dogs, he said.   I can tell, dont you ever clean this place?  You dont like dogs? he asked.   No, I like dogs fine, but this place is a mess, theres old food cans everywhere, trash, dog shit.   Get inside bitch, the passenger said stepping up on the porch, he opened the screen door and motioned for Lisa to enter.  She stepped inside and the warm moist overwhelming stench of rot almost knocked her off her feet.  Flies buzzed around her head and landed on her skin.  She dodged clothes piled on the floor next to food wrappers and dirty dishes.  Bedroom is on the right,  Lisa hesitated for a moment then heard the voice of an old woman coming from the far end of the room.  She didnt make out what the voice said at first and wondered if it was more than grunting sounds.  What did you say? she asked.   Who are you? the old woman asked.   The driver spoke up, Dont worry momma, she wont be here long.   Is this another one of your girlfriends? the woman asked.   No momma, shes a girl we picked up, she needs some stuff so we brought her here.   What sort of stuff does she need? the old woman asked peering over her glasses.  She was dressed sort of like a gypsy with a bandana and long hoop earrings.   Dont worry momma, I got this covered.   Lisa stepped around the piles of crap on the floor and walked over to the woman who was working Tarot cards on the cleanest part of the room.  Her table top.  What are you doing? Lisa asked.   Im reading the cards, the old woman replied.   What do they say?  They warn of great danger.   Danger for who?  For you my darling, the old woman replied.   Just then Toby stepped up and crawled onto the table.  Hey, I have a bad feeling about this, he said.  I think we better get out of here.   But we need the money, Lisa replied.   Yeah, but these guys are dangerous, and this looks like a crack house on steroids.   Do you have a better idea on how we can make some money? Lisa asked.   The old woman chimed in, Money? Sonny said you were here to get some stuff, he didnt say anything about money.   Get your ass in that bedroom! the driver said yelling at Lisa.   Whats going on Sonny? What are you doing to this poor girl?  Poor girl my ass, shes a prostitute, shes going to suck my dick for money, the driver yelled.   Nobodys using my house to bring prostitutes! the old woman yelled.   Im not a prostitute, I just need some money to get food and clothes, till I get back on my feet.  Lisa replied.   There was a long silence as the old woman thought about what she had heard.   How much do you need? the old woman asked  A hundred would get my by for now, Lisa replied.   The old woman reached into her purse and fished out some cash, she counted out a hundred dollars and handed it to Lisa.  There you go honey.   Lisa took the money and folded it in her hand.  Thank you, she said.   What about them? Toby asked looking at the two men who were expecting to get their balls drained by Lisa.   If my boys need female attention, they can go home to their wives, they have no business picking up innocent young girls.  They have families at home.   These are your boys? Toby asked.  Maybe they could pick up a broom and help clean your house.   Fuck you rat, the driver said low and slow.   This is your momma, you need to show some respect, get a mop and a bucket, clean the dog shit, get the flies out of here.   Dont worry Mr.  Beaver, the old woman said.  I can take care of myself.   Its obvious from the flies that you cant, maybe adult protective services need to be called, Toby said.   The driver stepped over and stood over Toby.  The driver was still three feet taller than the beaver who was standing on the table.  You call anyone and youll be a dead rat, Ill feed you to the dogs.   Toby looked up at the man towering above him.  Fuck you, Toby said defiantly.   The driver got a shit eating grin on his face and reached down to grab Toby, only to get a bite on his hand.   Ouch! the driver yelled pulling back his hand.  You mother fucking rat! he yelled and smacked Toby off the table with the back of his other hand.  Toby landed on a pile of magazines and rolled onto the floor.  Wheres my gun? the driver said feeling around his belt.   Its in the car, the passenger said who was pointing his gun at Toby ready to shoot.   Shoot the fucker, the driver said.   Give me a minute.   What are you waiting for?  Ive never met a talking beaver before, I think it would be a mistake to kill it.   Kill it and stuff it! Keep it on your TV stand! The fucker bit me!  And you hit it, I think thats fair.  And he has a point, this place is a shit hole, maybe you should clean it up.   Me? Shes your mother too?  Yeah, but these were your dogs, not mine or hers.  You need to clean up the dog shit and take care of the trash they made.   Im out of here! the driver said storming out the front door.   Hes a hot head mother fucker, dont worry about him, the passenger said.   What if hes going to the car to get his gun? Lisa asked.   Shit, I didnt think about that, rat, you better hide your ass now, the passenger said.  If he comes back with a gun, nobodys gonna stop him.        9   Hair Brush      Anne walked down the street leaving her husband and a dead male prostitute behind her.   She knew it would only be a matter of time before the police came and picked her up but fuck it, she didnt care.  She could even swear she heard police sirens in the distance.  Then a man approached and stopped her.   Hey lady, what are you doing? I just saw you shoot Rodney.   Rodney? You mean the guy my husband was trying to pick up?  Who is your husband? the man asked.   Roger Marie, Anne replied.   His last name is Marie? What kind of name is that?  Whats your name? Anne asked.   They call me Pool Cue, Pool Cue replied.   Why do they call you that?  Because Im tall and long, Pool Cue replied.   Thats nice, I got to get going before the police get here.   If you need a place to hide, I can help you out.   Why would you do that? Anne asked.   Seems like the proper thing to do for a lady.   No thanks, I dont know you, Ill take my chances out here.   Ever been to womens prison? Pool Cue asked.   No, not really, you?  Yes, I used to work in a women's correctional facility.  I was in the maintenance department.  The things I saw would make your skin crawl.  You wouldnt believe how cruel bitches can be.   Oh, I can imagine, Anne said.   Let me tell you a story.   I dont have time for a story.   You in a rush?  Anne stood there and thought for a moment, what the hell, she had no place to go and the cops would be here soon.  Go ahead, she said.   Ok, well, this happened one day and I shit you not this is the truth.  I was in the commons area when these three bitches decided to take on another bitch who they claimed ratted them out for selling contraband.  They waited till she was alone, grabbed her and took her in the corner where they stripped her down and raped her with a hairbrush.  Its was disgusting because I had to wear a hazmat suit to clean up all the blood.   Hairbrush? Anne asked.  How did they manage to sneak a hairbrush into the commons?  Fuck I dont know, those bitches are crazy, anyway, after that happened, a bunch of other bitches wanted to get revenge for those bitches raping that bitch with a hairbrush.  So those bitches waited till it was shower time and snuck in a razor shank and cut up those other bitches so bad they had to be taken to the hospital.  Luckily, most of the blood ended up in the shower so it didnt take long to clean that up.  But I still had to wear my hazmat suit.   Why dont you work at the prison now? Anne asked.   They caught me sneaking in shanks and hairbrushes to the bitches, Pool Cue replied.   Really, and all they did was fire you?  No, I got two years in prison, been out for three years now.   Well, thanks for the fun story but I better get going, Anne said stepping aside.   No, you need to hide, you dont want to go to jail, and not the one in this district, the chief of police is a real asshole, especially to women.   Whats the worst they can do? I shot my husband and a male prostitute, whatever they do I probably deserve.   Just then a police car spun around the corner with lights and sirens blazing.  They sped past Anne and Pool Cue and slid to a halt at her car where the two dead men lay in their own blood.  A few seconds later two more police cars came around the corner and came to a stop blocking off the end of the street.   Now youre fucked, Pool Cue said.  That blood on your shirts going to give you away.   Anne stood awaiting her fate as two officers ran down the sidewalk towards her guns drawn.  They stopped twenty feet from her and yelled, Down on the ground!  Anne and Pool Cue both got down on the ground lying face down on the concrete.  The police came up and placed their knees on their backs and cuffed them both.   He didnt do anything! Anne yelled, Im the one you want.   The officers didnt reply, they just pulled them up off the ground and stuffed them both in different police cars.       Twenty minutes later Anne was stripped and put in a line up.  None of the rest of the women were nude, but she decided not to rock the boat.  After a few minutes of staring at the one way glass, she was taken to get her mug shots and fingerprinted.  She was then taken into an interrogation room and left alone.   A few minutes later a male and female officer entered the room and sat down across the table from Anne who was now wearing an orange jail jumpsuit.  The officers both placed notepads on the table and took out pens.   Hello the female officer said.  My name is Sergeant Rosebud and this is officer Paint.  Before we start, Im going to read you your rights again.  You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law, you have the right to an attorney, if you cant afford an attorney, and one will be provided for you.  Do you understand these rights?  Yes, Anne replied.   Tell us what happened to your husband, Rosebud said.   I shot the fucker, Anne said.   Ok, and the other male found outside the car?  Shot him too, Anne said.   I think were done, thanks, Rosebud said, follow me.   Anne got up and followed the two officers out the door and down a long hall to the jail section.  Rosebud pressed a button and they were buzzed past a huge metal sliding gate.  Anne was walked down to a cell and put inside along with another inmate.   Cant I get my own cell? Most of these are empty? Anne asked.   This isnt a hotel, Rosebud said, then she walked away leaving Anne with her new cellmate.  The chief will be down in a minute, she added as she faded down the long hall.   Annes new cellmate, a thin, pale woman with droopy eyes and long stringy hair spoke up, What are you in for?  I killed my husband and his queer prostitute, Anne replied.   Oh, cool, the woman replied.   Whats your name? Anne asked.   Candye Kane, Candye replied.   What are you in for?  They say I ate my baby, Candye replied.   Holy shit! Did you?  I dont think so, maybe.   You are seriously fucked up, and they put me in a cell with you? Anne asked.   I didnt pick your cell, talk to the warden.   I will, get the fuck away from me you creepy ass bitch, Anne said moving to the far wall.   Im pretty sure I didnt eat my baby, I can still hear her crying, and you hear that?  Anne stood quiet and listened.  No, I dont hear a baby.   Listen close, shes inside me.   Anne freaked in horror, Oh my fucking God! You did eat your baby!  Shes back inside me, Im going to have another baby, and shell be reborn again.   I need to get the fuck out of here, Anne said.  Youre a delusional cannibal.   Candye Kane stood up and walked over to Anne who moved away with every approaching step.  You want to feel my baby? Candye asked rubbing her belly.  I can feel her kick.   Anne put up her hands in a defensive position and blocked Candye from getting too close.  Sit back down, you hear me? You fucking freak, sit your ass back down now!  Candye looked at Anne like she was crazy.  Youre a woman, just like me, dont you want to feel my baby?  Guard! Anne yelled.  Get me out of here!  The room was silent as Candye Kane stood before Anne stroking her flat belly.  They looked at each other waiting for the other to speak first.  Then Candye sat back down and looked to the ceiling and shut her eyes.  I think shes coming, I feel a contraction.   No fucking way, Anne said.  Youre not pregnant, you ate your kid.   No, I feel the pressure, I think my water is breaking.   Anne looked and saw piss running off the seat Candye was sitting on.  It was yellow and smelled like pee.  Youre pissing all over the floor, Anne said.  Stop it!  I think shell be here soon, maybe an hour, or less.   Anne sat on what was her bed, a cold steel bench across from Candye.  She saw a shadow coming down the hall that foreshadowed the warden that stopped at her cell.   What the fuck is that on the floor? the warden asked pissed.  Is she pissing herself?  She thinks shes having a baby, Anne replied.  She says its her water breaking.   Stupid cunt, ate her baby and now this, we need a psych down here.   No shit, get me the fuck out away from her before she decides to eat me!  The chief of police signaled for the cell door to be open and he stepped inside.   You know she calls you the Warden? Anne asked.   No, Ive never actually met her, she came in last night at two a. m.  the chief replied.   What are you going to do with her? I cant stay in this cell with a nut who eats her own kid and pisses all over the floor.   I can get you a mop, the chief said.   A mop? Excuse me? Anne asked.  I saw a half dozen empty cells on my way here, you can put me in one of those.   Sorry, unless a prisoner is deemed dangerous, policy is to double occupy all cells.   Anne stood up and approached the chief.  She pointed at the crazy woman lying in her own pee and said, She ate her own baby!  Yeah, but youre a bit big for her to eat so Im not too worried.   Im not worried shell eat me! Im worried shell try! Anne yelled.   Tell you what, Ill post a guard outside your door for an hour, if anything happens, shell jump in and help, if not, youre on your own, the chief said stepping out of the cell.  Ill get a maintenance guy to bring you a mop and bucket to clean up the urine.   Thats another thing, her piss is a safety issue, and its probably full of diseases.  You cant leave me here with an infected psycho.   Youre making assumptions here miss, nobody knows if her pee is infected or not.  Now I have important chief things I need to attend to, youll be fine.  Calm down, the chief said and he left the cell.   Anne looked back at Candye as the cell door shut behind her with a clink and a slam.  If you come near me Im going to fuck you up, she said.   I dont really appreciate you telling the warden Im some disease ridden freak.  You dont know me, Candye said.   I know enough, when that mop gets here, youre cleaning up your own piss mess, and get the fuck up, you know you youre not having a baby.  Youre making this shit up.   No, I had my baby already, didnt you see her?  You didnt have a baby, I was talking to the warden for less than five minutes and you still have your pants on.   Candye reached behind her and pulled out what looked like a skin colored rubber hose about two feet long with dark blue veins running the length of it.  She tossed it on the ground at Annes feet, and to her horror realized it was an umbilical cord severed with Candyes teeth.        10   Sam      Judd finished his supper, it was two grilled cheese sandwiches and a glass of unsweetened tea.  He paid his bill and walked back to Vamps to see about getting the car to go home.  When he got there a police car was parked at the front door so he panicked, he knew he had just beat the shit out of Momma less than an hour ago and now he might be going to jail.  But then she was his captor so maybe theyd have empathy for him, or maybe the cops were there to get gas and some diet Coke, who knows, they did sell gas.   Excuse me, Judd heard and turned around to see a woman standing behind him.  He thought he recognized her from the Polish pizza place.  She was about thirty, medium length brown hair and dressed in a tight fitting wrestling unitard and cowgirl boots.   Yeah, what can I do for you? Judd asked.   I saw what you did back there in the restaurant, I wanted to know if you might want to get a drink or something? she asked.   Are you asking me for a date? Judd asked.   Yeah, but its no big deal, I can see youre busy.   No, no, Im never that busy, whats your name? Judd asked.   Sam, Sam Danger, Danger replied.   Is that short for Samantha?  No, its short for Samurai.   Judd looked hard to make sure this chick wasnt a dude, but she had huge tits and hips that looked like they could birth an elephant.  Ok Sam, what do you have in mind?  I thought maybe you could come back to my place and we could wrestle.   I was wondering about that outfit you were wearing, you dont see many girls wearing those.   Im not a girl, Im a woman, I have pubic hair, Sam replied.  You want to see it?  Yes, actually I would, Judd replied.   After we wrestle, Ill show it to you, Sam said.   Intrigued, Judd walked towards Sam, she reached out and took his hand as if they had been dating for a week.  It surprised Judd but he went with it.  Did you walk here? Judd asked.   Walking is good for you, she replied.   Yes, how far is it to your place?  About six miles, I live out in the country.   Six miles, I havent walked six miles since never, can we call and get a ride?  What? You dont want to go out with me now? Sam asked pissed.   Im not saying that, I just dont want to walk six miles, and thats six miles back later on.   You want me to call you a cab you big fucking baby, Sam snapped.   Wow, we just met and already you're a cunt.   Cunt? Nobody calls me a cunt, not even my daddy! she said and punched Judd in the gut.   Holy fuck you stupid bitch! Get the hell away from me! Judd yelled holding his arms across his midsection in pain.   Sam walked over and touched Judd on the shoulder, Im sorry, Im not usually like that.   Im going back to the gas station, I dont think our date is working out, Judd said.   Why? Is there another woman? Sam asked.   Judd thought for a second.  Yes, Im dating someone right now, shes a lot less violent.   You think your girlfriend is better than me? Sam snapped back.   Yes, Im pretty sure she is.   I bet you think shes better in bed too!  Yep, she keeps my balls pretty dry, wouldnt give that up for the world.   Ready to explode in a rage of jealousy, Sam began pulling off her unitard.  She exposed her huge breasts and then her wide birthing hips.  Judd was actually turned on.   What are you doing? Judd asked.   Im going to show you what it really means to have your balls drained, she replied and kicked off the rest of her clothes in the street.  She stepped over to Judd and grabbed him, placed one of his hands on her ass, one on her left tit and put her tongue in his mouth and began to French him.  Judd could feel his dick getting hard although this was a very awkward situation.  Judd unclenched her lips long enough to ask, What if people see us?  Sam looked around and saw a couple sitting on the porch watching them.  I dont think they mind, she said.  Lets get on the grass so I can show you what I got.  If you think fucking is all there is to a relationship, Ill show you fucking.    We dont have a relationship, we just met, Judd tried to explain.  He was having a hard time getting his point across because he really wanted to fuck this woman.  But she seemed a bit crazy at the same time.  It was like trying to screw and angry badger when youre as honey as hell.   Sam dragged Judd off the street onto the grass terrace and shoved him on his back.  She unsnapped his pants, pulled off his shoes and stripped him from the waist down.  Wow, you have a little dick, Sam said flicking it with her finger.  My German shepherd has a bigger one.   Then go fuck your dog, Judd said insulted.   Dont tell me who to fuck, Sam snapped back.   You mean what, not who, dogs arent people.   At least my dog doesnt complain when Im getting him off, Sam replied.   You fuck your dog? Judd asked.   Of course, and my two horses.   You must be bored out like a subway tunnel, Judd said.  Then he looked at Sams pussy and saw how it sagged down like an old used rag.   I get lonely out in the country, not a lot of men around there.  A woman has to do what a woman has to do, I get urges you know, and Im human.   I bet you do, Judd replied.  I really dont think this is going to work out, if you dont mind, Id like to get my car and get going.   You had a car this whole time? Sam asked.   Its not my car, and the last I knew they were still scraping a body off the trunk.  It might not be ready yet.   No, its not, they have it locked down at the impound yard, Sam said.   How do you know?  I walked past it, so did you, didnt you see it?  No, I wasnt paying attention, I wasnt looking for a car with a dead body dented in the trunk.  Fuck, now what am I going to do?  You can stay with me till you get a ride, Sam replied.   Thats still six fucking miles to your place, and you want to fuck me with that horse twat.   Fine, be that way, its getting dark and you have no way to get home, fuck you, Sam said and she began to get dressed.  The couple on the porch booed.   The old lady at the shop said I could sleep in the back room, Ill be fine.   Pissed again, Sam spoke up, You want to sleep in a building full of vampires? Good luck with that, might as well be sleeping in a meat grinder.   What do you mean? Judd asked.   She only offered to let you stay so her family could make a late night snack out of you.  They sell good cars, they are decent mechanics, but in the end, they are blood sucking vampires who would suck you dry in a minute if they had the chance.   Youre just saying that because youre pissed.   Oh no, Sam laughed, You go try it, let me know how it worked out for you in the morning.  Oh, never mind you wont be around in the morning, see, they dont turn people into vampires, they corner the market on that, when theyre done, they cut you up and burn youre in the oven.  You are a Pizza Pocket to them, nothing more, and they keep your car.  Dumb ass, Sam said slipping the rest of her clothes back on.   Judd lay on the ground with a limp dick wondering what to do.  It was dark out and he had no place to go.  His phone was back in the shop getting charged, guarded by a family of vampires.  He couldnt even call anyone.  Unless he borrowed a phone.  Can I borrow your phone? Judd asked.   Sam pulled it out of her pocket and shoved it down her unitard into her crotch.  Come and get it, she said with a grin.   Youre going to void the warranty doing that, I used to work at a phone store at the mall.  Wed get phones that girls used to masturbate with all the time, they quit working and they got pissed when we didnt replace them.  We eventually started selling vibrators so theyd leave their phones out of their pussies.   Dont worry about me or my phone mister, if you want to call momma, you got to come get it, and its clamped down tight, Sam said.       Two hours later, Sam and Judd arrived at Sams place in the country, Judds feet hurt but Sam was as happy as she could be.  She liked the long walks and now she had a guy all to herself on her own turf.   Want to see the bedroom? Sam asked.   What do you do for a living? Judd asked.   I raise hogs, Sam replied.   No wonder it smells like shit, Judd replied.  How do you stand that smell?  I dont notice it, Sam replied, Want to see my bedroom?  Sure, lets see it, Judd replied.   Give me ten minutes to get it ready, no make that fifteen, Ill call you when Im ready, Sam said and she took off into the bedroom      Forty Five minutes later Sam called Judd into the bedroom, he stepped inside to see her laying on a leopard print bedspread wearing a pink teddy and six inch pink heels, dressed like a Victorias secret model with no panties.   For a moment Judd is turned on, until he saw her flabby pussy lips laying on the bed like a flat pancake.  Is there any way you can tighten those back up? They look like play dough.   Sam picked up some of her pussy lips between her fingers and let it drop back down with a thud.  Is there a doctor that can fix me? she asked.   Im sure there is, how can you fuck a horse anyway?  Give it a blow job and get on all fours, its easy, Sam replied.   Doesnt that hurt?  Only when they get it in the wrong hole, they have a hard time seeing where theyre sticking it.  I have to help them out and sometimes they get a little testy.   Im really grossed out right now, Judd said.   You brought it up, Sam said, now get over here and lay down with me.   We tried this once and it didnt work out, I think I better sleep on the couch, Judd said.   This is the only room with a fan, it gets pretty hot out there.   Judd looked at the bed and had an idea.  Ill sleep in here, but no sex, I get my half, you get your half.   Disappointed, Sam agreed.  She knew shed go for it later, but at least for now she had him in the bed with her.  I do want you to cuddle with me, she said.   Really, you know what that will lead to, Id rather not.   Fine, be that way, get your clothes off and get in bed with me, now! she barked at Judd.   Calm down, I told you no sex, just sleeping.   Oh, dont worry your pretty little head mister, I wont try to get in your pants again.  Im used to a dick I can feel, not one that would get lost.   Hey, you got a big pussy, my dick isnt that small, and its pretty average for most guys.   How do you know? Are you queer? Sam asked.  You like looking at other guys dicks? she said laughing.   No, Ive seen pictures in medical journals, now shut the fuck up.   Sam watched Judd get undressed and stroked her tits as he got down to his boxers.  She licked her lips and rolled onto her back.  Are you sure? It would only take a minute and it would make me so happy.  I dont actually like horse dick, I prefer a man.   Id have to roll a towel around my dick just to make it big enough to make you feel anything.  Whats the point? Judd asked.   Sam turned off the light pissed and rolled onto her side.  Breakfast is at six, dont snore or touch the fan.  Good night.        11   Dumped      Five a. m.  the alarm went off and Sam pushed Judd to wake him.  Judd grumbled and failed to wake.  So Sam turned on the light and kicked the bed, she was still in her teddy with her hair messed up.  Judd rolled over and squinted in the bright light from above and asked, What the fuck are you doing? Its still dark out.   Got hogs to feed, get up, she replied  Im not feeding any hogs, you feed your hogs, Judd said with his face planted in the pillow.   You got a free night in my bed, and got laid, you are going to help feed my hogs.   What? I didnt get laid last night, Judd said.   Sorry you did, I put sleeping pills in your drink last night, it wasnt the best sex Ive had, but it worked, Sam said pulling on her rubber boots.   Are you going to wear your nightgown to feed the hogs?  Yeah, why not? No use getting clean clothes out, theyre hogs.  Sam stood up in front of the bed wearing her pink teddy and rubber boots.  You ready? she asked.   Even if I were going to feed your hogs, which Im not, I would take a shower first.  You cant lay in bed all night and get up and be all gross.   Youre going to be covered in hog shit, showers a waste of time till youre done.   How long does it take to feed your hogs? Judd asked.   Be done by ten, Sam replied.   Judd looked at the clock.  Why does it take five hours to feed your hogs? How many do you have?  About two hundred head, she replied.   Two hundred? You take care of two hundred hogs all by yourself? Judd asked.   No, I got me three Mexicans, She replied  Really, Judd said.  Let them feed the fucking hogs, Im going back to bed.   The Mexicans dont feed the hogs, they do other chores, I feed the hogs, now get your lazy ass out of my bed.   Judd pushed the covers off and sat at the edge of the bed.  Do you have more rubber boots? he asked.   Youll have to get a pair from one of the Mexicans, I dont keep extra boots in the house.   Where are these Mexicans as you put it? Judd asked.   Out in the barn tending to the hogs, what do you think dumb ass?  Tell you what, you start and Ill meet you later, ok?  Sam shook her head in disgust.  If youre going to be my boyfriend, you need to get a few things straight.   Boyfriend? Judd asked with a look of disgust on his face.  You offered to let me stay the night, you never said anything about me being your boyfriend.   Sorry, boyfriend, get your ass going, lunch is at noon.   Judd put on his clothes and followed Sam outside.  The sun was just coming up and the fresh smell of hog shit rose in the air.  Now he could see the huge feedlot full of hungry hogs and the barn she was talking about.  Do these Mexicans speak English? Judd asked.   One of them does, Ricardo, hes the one without a mustache.  Sam replied.   I dont know how to drive a tractor, how am I supposed to feed the hogs?  We dont use a tractor, you ride on the trailer and throw the hog feed in the trough.  Its back breaking hard work, but Ill make it up to you tonight in bed.  I have a new nighty I want to show you.   Thats not an incentive, I feel like youre making me a prisoner here.   No, you can leave anytime you want too after you feed the hogs, you owe me that much for the room and board.   Ill pay you cash when I get to an ATM, Judd replied.   I dont have an ATM, Sam stated.   They have one in town, I saw it.  It was next door at the gas station, Ill start walking now and get you some cash.   I dont want your cash, I want you, Sam said with a girly smile.   Look Sam, Im a city boy, I cant live on a hog farm, and it would never work out.   Are you dumping me? she said with a tear in her squinty eye.   Dumping? We arent going out, I cant dump you, Judd replied.   If you dump me, Ill have my Mexicans feed you to the hogs, you know hogs will eat people? I lost a Mexican once in this very lot, fell off a feeder truck and never found him again.  Fucking hogs at him.   You seem angry, Judd said.   I am, he was my favorite Mexican.   I have a question, you keep calling them Mexicans, and dont you mean Hispanic? Judd asked.   No, these guys are actually from Mexico, she replied.   Oh, alright, are they legal?  Fuck I dont know, all I know is they get up at three in the morning to take care of my hogs and take a hog every two weeks as pay.  Works out for both of us.   Judd looked out over the vast expanse of hogs and hog shit.  How did you ever get this place in the first place? he asked.   It belonged to my dead husband Philip, I got it all when he died.   Oh, Im sorry, I didnt know.   Thats ok, I shot him and fed him to the hogs, cheating bastard deserved to die, Sam said.   So youve lost a Mexican and an ex-husband to the hogs? Judd asked.   Yes, and two sheriffs deputies and a nosy neighbor.  You might be next if you try to leave me, Sam said with a serious look in her eye.   Is that a threat? Judd asked.   Try it, see what happens lover boy, she said as the dawn sun lit up her pink night gown and grey hog boots.   Im leaving, Judd said and took off down the driveway towards the gravel road leaving Sam and her hog operation behind.  It was then he felt the kick in his back the knocked him on his face.  He raised his head and spit out gravel feeling the full weight of Sam on his back.  She had her arm around his neck and was lying prone on top of him with the other arm wrapped around his forehead.   What are you doing? Judd choked out almost unable to breath.   Its a wrestling move fucker, called a choke hold, Sam replied.   So that unitard you were wearing wasnt just a fashion statement, Judd said out of breath.   Im the county champion wrestler, three years running.   You usually run people down from the back when they arent looking?  You call me a cheater? Sam asked pulling tighter on Judds forehead pulling his head back and stretching out his neck.   No, but kicking me in the back wasnt fair, you didnt give me any warning.   Sam jammed her bony knee into Judds back and said, No shit, why would I give you a warning? Youd just run faster.   Judd started to lose consciousness as the blood flow to his brain was being cut off by the choke hold.  He started to see red and gently faded into darkness.  Then he went limp.   This gave Sam a chance to call her Mexicans so she pulled her cell phone out of her teddy top and dialed the only one that spoke English, Ricardo.       Twenty minutes later, Judd found himself tied to a post next to the entrance of the barn.  He was just outside enough that the sun beat down on him.  Inside the barn was Ricardo, Sam and the two other Mexicans loading the feed truck with sacks of hog feed.  Judd tried to get loose but his binding was too tight.  It was then Sam looked over and noticed Judd was awake.  She walked out of the barn and stood looking down at Judd who looked up at her with the sun glare over her shoulder.  She was now wearing just a bra and shorts combo.  The nightgown must have got dirty.   I see youre awake, Sam said.  Try to run away now, she dared him.   Judd pulled on his bindings but nothing happened.   Yeah, just like I thought, you arent going anywhere mister, I had Juan tie you up good.  He knows knots.   Good for him, now let me go, this is kidnapping! Judd yelled back.  He noticed the Mexicans heard him and they all walked over to see what was going on.   You ok miss Sam? Ricardo asked.   Yeah, Im fine, hes just blowing off steam, and hell come around soon enough.   If you like, me and the boys can fuck him up for you,  No, we need to get the rest of the hogs fed, I can deal with him, Im a big girl, Sam said.  She leaned down and pulled down her top exposing her farmers tan tits to Judd.  Youre going to be on these later like a bee to honey.   Why would a bee go to honey? Dont you mean bear? Judd asked.   Fuck you, Sam said righting herself.  Tonight, no sleeping pills, I want you awake for all the fun.   Really, how are you going to do that? Judd asked.   Ricardo and the boys will be there to help, you dont put out, they will make you wish you had, she said with a smile.   Sam walked back to the house and let the Mexican finish feeding the hogs, she had to make lunch and didnt want to be disturbed.   Hey! Judd yelled to Ricardo.   What you want? Ricardo replied.   Untie me, he said.   Ricardo laughed and asked, Whats the magic word?  Please, Judd replied.   Nope, Ricardo said and shook his head in disgust.  Its Rumpelstiltskin you dumb ass, now bake in the sun for a while, itll teach you a lesson.   Let me go Rumpelstiltskin? Judd asked.   Too late, I got to go, things to do.   I can pay you, Judd said.   I dont want your money, she gives me more than money.  I have a place to live, you better be nice to her or we'll fuck you up, you got me?  Ricardo walked away and left Judd baking in the hot sun.  Maybe at lunch he could find a way to get loose when they fed him, but for now he was beyond fucked, hot and thirsty tied to a pole like a donkey.  Hey! How about some water? he yelled.  The men ignored him and went on filling the feed truck.   You better do what they say, Judd heard.  He looked around and all he saw was a stray hog on the other side of the fence.  Who said something? Judd asked.   I did, the hog said.  You better do what they say, these are mean fuckers.  They will cut you up and feed you to the other hogs alive, I know, Ive helped eat one of you before.  You taste like grease and cigarettes.   Am I having a delusion? Hogs dont talk.   Youre right, most hogs dont talk, but I do, Im not the same as all those other dirty smelly swine.   Is that why youre all alone over there?  Pretty much, had a falling out with my boyfriend last week and now Im hoofing it all alone.   Youre a male hog, right?  A bore, yes, the hog replied.   So how do you have a boyfriend? Ive never heard of a gay hog before.   Yeah, hes my ex, been together for five weeks, then he finds another tight ass and leaves me, tells me he never loved me in the first place, it was all sex for him.   Used you for sex? Im going through that now, Judd said.   I heard, the bitch that runs this place is a nutjob, watch out what you do and say, she tossed her husband in here and now she runs the place like Hitler.   How do you know about Hitler? Judd asked.   I watch a lot of the History channel.        12   Dog House      Toby waited patiently for the driver to return with his gun, instead he heard the car start and drive off.   Thank God, Toby said scratching his ass with a claw.   Yeah, now lets get down to business, the passenger said looking at Lisa.   I dont need your money anymore, she said taking a step back.   Doesnt change the fact we had an agreement, now get in the bedroom, he said pointing to the open door.   Now you leave her alone, the old woman said.  This is my house and I wont have any of that going on!  The passenger looked at his mother and said, Shut the fuck up Momma and mind your own business.  The passenger stepped towards Lisa and put his hand out to guide her to the bedroom.  Lisa complied, made her way to the bedroom and sat down on the filthy bed.  Toby scrambled up from behind and sat at her feet like a cute little guard dog.   The passenger unbuttoned his pants and let them drop to his knees exposing his four inch flaccid penis.  It was surrounded by a nasty curly hairy bush.  Get to it girl the man said looking down at Lisa at the edge of the bed.   Lisa grabbed the tip of the penis and squished it like a sponge.  She rocked it back and forth and almost bent it in half.   Stop playing with it and put it in your mouth bitch, the passenger said.   Lisa touched her tongue to the tip and tasted it, it tasted like three day old piss.  Can you wash it off first? she asked looking up at the man towering above her.   Use your mouth, he said.   Lisa put the rest of his penis in her mouth and sat there.  She really hadnt done this a lot and didnt know what to do.  Put your hand on it and rub, he said frustrated.   Lisa put her hand on the top of his penis and petted it like a cat, pissed, the passenger smacked Lisa across the face, scraping his own cock with her teeth and sending her on her side.  That hurt you cunt! he yelled.  He looked down at his cock to see if there was any blood.   Dont play stupid girl, I know you how to suck cock!  Then Toby spoke up, How do you know? You just met her a half hour ago.   All women know how to please a man, shes just fucking with me because she dont need the money anymore.  Ill teach her a lesson about pleasing a man, bitch! the passenger said pulling Lisa up to a sitting position.   What are you going to do to her? Toby asked.   Watch, the passenger said rolling Lisa over onto her belly.  Once he had her ass up in the air, he bent over, spread her legs and shoved his face in her pussy from behind.  Lisa opened her eyes wide in shock, shed never had anyone do this to her before and to her surprise she liked it.  Instead of getting all pissy and bitchy, she began to gyrate and move her ass in circles getting all the pleasure she could get from this mans tongue.   Toby crawled up onto the bed and watched this man go down on Lisa from behind.  It was quite a show and Toby got a little beaver woody.  You like that? Toby asked Lisa.   Lisa rolled her head over in Tobys direction and opened her eyes.  She had to stop moaning to reply.  This is fucking awesome, if this is what sex is supposed to be all about, Im going to be a whore, she said closing her eyes, enjoying this mans talented tongue in her crack.   You mind if I get some? Toby asked shyly.   Youre a rat, you probably have fleas, I dont think so.   This guy might have fleas, whats your issue?  Too late now, Lisa replied and began to moan louder and rock harder back and forth.  I want you in me! she shouted so he flipped over on her back.  She spread her legs as wide as she could and rocked her hips back for better penetration.  Once in position, the passenger rammed his rock hard cock into Lisa and let her have it will all his might.  Back and forth they went, slamming her head into the headboard until a candle and a book fell off the top hitting Lisa in the tit.   Thirty seconds later the passenger blew his wad and shoved his dick in so far it make the skin on her butt bulge out.  He closed his eyes as his penis pulsated from the rhythmic contractions of the cum leaving his cock landing deep inside Lisa.  He waited a few seconds and pulled his dick out leaving her laying on her back.  Splooge dripped on the bed.  It was then she noticed a yellow lab sitting on the bed watching her.  Where did that come from? she asked, not liking being watched by anyone, or any animals.   From my cock bitch, the passenger said.   No, the dog, where did he come from? Lisa asked again  The passenger looked at the dog and replied, This is his room.   What? Lisa asked.   This is my mothers house, and the dog is hers, she gave my room to the dog when I moved out at fourteen.   Why are there clothes strung all over the place?  Stupid dog cant put away his laundry.       Then a crash came from the window and a flaming bottle smashed against the far wall exploding in a fireball that lit up the curtains and a pile of old blankets in the corner.  The passenger crawled off and ran out the door leaving Toby and Lisa behind.  Run! Toby yelled, scrambling out the door followed by Lisa, neither were burned but they were scared shitess.  To the front door! Toby yelled,  Wheres his mother? Lisa yelled looking around, then she saw her through the front door walking down the sidewalk with her walker.  Lisa ran out the front door following Toby and caught up with the old lady.  Youre house is on fire! Lisa yelled.   I know, I saw Sonny drive up to the house and light up the bottle, the old woman said.   Thanks for letting us know! Lisa said.   Im an old woman, I dont walk so fast, you can run out, I cant.   You could have yelled, Toby snapped.  Either way, were getting the fuck out of here, we got money, lets go! Toby yelled to Lisa.    I agree, Lisa said.   What about me? the old woman asked.  My house is on fire and my dogs are still inside!  No they arent, theyre across the street pissing on your neighbors yard, Toby said.  Probably the only time they havent used your house for a toilet.   Lisa and Toby took off walking as fast as they could from the burning house leaving the old lady behind.  Shell be fine, Toby said.   I know, Lisa replied, I dont have any sympathy for her.   She did give you money, she didnt have too.   Dont try to make me feel guilty, her son tried to rape me and she didnt do anything to help, shes as guilty as they are.   We need to find a place to get some food and you some clothes, Toby said.  Lets head towards downtown.       An hour later Lisa was standing at an intersection with splooge running down her leg.  She was still naked and traffic was heavy.  Across the street was a mini mall with a Chinese restaurant that looked very good right now.  You like Chinese? Lisa asked.   I told you before, I eat twigs and shit like that, Toby replied.   I think Chinese has twigs in it, Lisa replied.   Id be better off finding lunch at the park, should be plenty of trees there.   How can you eat that? Sounds gross.   How can you eat Chinese? And Im not even making a cat joke, Toby said.   I love Chinese, the noodles, the sauce, Im dying for some, sure you dont want to try?  Ill give it a shot I suppose, Toby said and they walked across the street to the Chinese place.  It was a buffet so they didnt have to try to speak Chinese off a menu.   Once inside an Asian woman approached them and asked, Two?  Lisa replied, Yes.   What to drink?  Two waters please.   Drinks are free with Buffet, the woman said.   Ok, Ill take a diet Coke, what do you want? she asked Toby.   You have Dr.  Pepper? he asked.   Yes, we have Dr.  Pepper, the Asian woman replied.   Ok, Ill take a Dr.  Pepper, Toby replied and the Asian woman escorted them to a seat.  None of the customers seem to notice the beaver or the nude woman following her.  Or at least they didnt want to make it obvious.   What do you want to do now? Toby asked now that they were calmly sitting down and able to have a normal conversation.   After were done eating, I want to go to the clothing store in this mall, Lisa replied.  I have enough for get one outfit and some shoes.   What kind of shoes? Toby asked.   Does it matter?  Just trying to make conversation, I know about chicks and their shoes.   Maybe some flip flops, Lisa said.   Youve got to be kidding, flip flops?  What do you suggest?  Four inch heels, black, with a thin strap that goes across the top, Toby replied.   Im not applying for a job at a strip club, I dont need shoes like that, plus you cant really walk in them for long.   Fine, get some flip flops, what is this 1969? Toby asked sipping on the Dr.  Pepper the Asian woman delivered to the table.   This is a buffet, we should get our food, Lisa said.   I cant reach the food, youre going to have to get mine for me.   Fine, Ill get you all the twigs I can find, Lisa said getting up from her booth.  She walked over to the buffet tables and grabbed a plate.  Then she noticed a man looking at her chatting with a woman like they were making fun of her.  They would cover their mouths and look away when she looked back at them.  In between they would sneak peeks at her naked body.   She tried to ignore the couple then noticed another group doing the same thing, then a table with two women looking at her like she was some sort of cheap hooker.  She again tried to ignore the stares and move on adding food to her plate.  Then the manager walked up to her and said, Miss, my customers are making complaints.   Yeah, I figured, Im planning on getting some clothes after I eat, Im starving.   Its not that, its your beaver friend over there at the booth, hes been asking for money from my customers, says youre his retarded sister and needs money to get you back to the asylum.   That little fucker! Lisa said.   Is this true? Are you retarded?  No! And Im not his sister! Hes a rat if you cant tell.   Oh, I can tell, we have a discount for all rodents this month.   I dont want to know why, please dont tell me, I can assure you Im not his sister and Im not retarded.   If you dont mind, Id like to test you to make sure.   Test me? Lisa asked.   Yes, if you dont mind, I have a few trivia questions for you, if you can answer them, Ill be satisfied.   Lisa stood there at the buffet table, naked and pissed shaking her head in disgust.  Fine, ask away.   Ok, here is the first question, name any Chinese philosopher?  Whats a philosopher? Lisa asked.   Second question, if you were traveling the speed of light and turned on a flashlight, what would happen?  Thats easy, it would get brighter, she replied.   Not the answer I was going for, but Ill give you credit.   Is there a third question?  No, now get out of my restaurant, the manager said.  Youre beaver is causing too many problems.        13   Art Class      Now hold on, Lisa pleaded.  Im not responsible for what my beaver does.   Is he with you or not? the manager asked.   Sort of, not exactly, I only know him a little.   He says hes related to you.   Hes a beaver, cant you see the difference? Lisa said as she pointed at herself.   Ok, hes not your brother, but I cant have him disturbing my regular customers, the manager said.   Ill talk to him, let me get my food and I promise hell shut up.   Fine, you have ten min, now hurry up, the managers said and he walked back into the kitchen.   Pissed, Lisa had to get her food much faster than she wanted too and didnt get the time she wanted to pick through the buffet like usual.  She filled her plate, grabbed some  rolls, and scurried back to the booth where Toby was waiting for her.  Did you tell people I was your retarded sister? she asked.  Caught, Toby avoided eye contact and played with his chopsticks.  Im talking to you, you fucking oversized rat!  Toby looked Lisa in the eye and said, I may have, I cant be for certain, I have these spells.   Spells my ass, youre trying to make money off me calling me stupid!  What does it matter? Money is money.   You almost got us kicked out! Lisa yelled.   Sorry, I didnt know, wheres my sticks and bark? Toby asked.   If they have any, I didnt see it, he gave me ten minutes to clear this up or he was kicking us out.   What am I supposed to do? Apologize? Toby asked.   Lisa looked over at the door to the kitchen, the manager was standing halfway out looking at her.  She gave him a thumbs up and he went back inside.  We lucked out on that one, dont do it again.   Might be too late, Toby said.  I got you a gig as a nude art model.   How in the hell did you do that? I was only gone for a few minutes.   When you got up to get the food, a girl came over and asked if you did any nude art modeling, I said all the time.  She asked how much and I said two hundred an hour.  She said she wanted to book you tonight.   Did you do a background check on her? Lisa asked.   I dont have a smartphone, no I didnt do a background check on her.  Toby replied.  Its two hundred bucks and all you have to do is sit there and let someone draw you.  I think you should be thanking me, not bitching me out.   Fine, but you have to guard me the whole time, are you able to do that? Do you have any training? Lisa asked.   I took a class on self-defense for women once at the Optimist club.   Why? Lisa asked.   It was free and they served a free lunch, Toby replied.   What did you learn from this class? Lisa asked.   I learned a lot of stuff.   Such as?  That the heel of a high heel shoe can take a man's eyeball out, Toby replied.   What else?  That kicking a guy in the nuts can give you enough time to escape.   Thats pretty basic stuff, what did they teach you I dont already know? Lisa asked.   Toby picked at his food and thought hard.  He picked some more and then at a noodle.  This is good, I should have been eating Chinese a long time ago.  Fuck twigs and leaves.   Stop avoiding the question, what else do you know? Lisa asked.   Thats about it, I didnt pay much attention, I was there for the free lunch, Toby replied.  Now are you going to do the gig or not? If Im going to be your manager, you need to let me know what youre willing to do.  If I book you on a porn shoot, will you have sex with vegetables?  How did you jump from modeling at an art class to fucking cucumbers? Lisa asked.   Because this isnt really an art class, its a porn shoot, Toby replied.   Porn? Who is this girl?  Dont know, but from her business card, I think she works freelance, Toby replied.   Let me see the card, Lisa said with her hand outstretched.   Toby handed the card over to Lisa and she took a look at it.  It was a plain white card with pen marks on it.  This is homemade, and looks like she cut up some printer paper and scribbled a phone number and address on it.  There isnt a business name on it anywhere.   Its porn, they tend not to want to leave a trail if you know what I mean.   No, what do you mean? Lisa asked.   Some of the folk in porn are a bit unsavory.   Lisa bit her lip and took a sip of her soda.  No shit, she replied and started eating her food.  Are you going to eat? she asked.   Are you going to do the shoot? Toby asked.   What does it involve?  You and three girls baking a cake.   And then?  Not sure, I didnt get to see the script.   How about a synopsis? Lisa asked.   Im sure it has to do with you licking or fingering somebody, its not Shakespeare.   For this I get two hundred dollars?  Yes, Toby replied.   When do I get paid?  She didnt say but these are usually pay after play sorts of deals.   Cash?  Dont know, they have to account for their payouts, may be a check.   Cash only, and I wear a mask.   That might be a deal breaker, nobody wants to see a chick getting banged wearing a mask, she might pay fifty for that, Toby replied.   Where is she? Lisa asked.  Get her over here.   Toby looked over Lisas shoulder and made a gestured to someone behind her.  Shes coming, Toby said.   In an instant, a four hundred pound black woman slid her giant ass into the booth seat next to Lisa knocking her into the side window.  Did you talk to her? the woman asked.   Yeah, I think shell do it for cash, Toby said.   The woman looked at Lisa and scanned her body.  Hi, my name is Tanisha, whats yours?  Lisa, Lisa said.   Did your friend tell you I was interested in hiring you for a little art project? she asked with her hands in quotes.   He said you wanted me to have sex with three other women on tape for two hundred dollars.   We were still negotiating the price, I think two hundred is way out of line.   What were you thinking? Lisa asked.   Seventy five, maybe a hundred if you let them fuck you with a baseball bat, Tanisha replied.   Oh fuck no! Lisa said.  For that, a thousand.   I could get ten women in this place to do that for a thousand, I cant just pay everyone a thousand, money doesnt grow on trees honey and your pussy isnt worth all that much, youve been giving it away for free ever since youve been in here.   For seventy five, Ill let one girl touch my nipple, with a finger, Lisa said.   Never mind, Ill find someone else, Tanisha said.   Wait, ok, Ill let two women lick one nipple each.   No, you will let them fuck the shit out of you with whatever they want and like it.  Its a ten minute video and Ill pay you cash as soon as we make sure we got it on tape.   I want one twenty five, Lisa said.   For that you have to fuck your little beaver friend here, bestiality sells pretty good.   I dont think so, Lisa said.  Im going to finish my lunch and go to the clothing store, Im taking my beaver with me, but Im not fucking it, not for seventy five bucks.       Tanisha got up and left leaving Lisa with her beaver, Toby.  How dare you try to sell me to some porn place for seventy five bucks, she said with a mouthful of noodles.   Not my fault shes so cheap, Toby replied.  He tried some sort of chicken and loved it.  Man, I think I was lied too, this is so much better than bark.   Hurry up, I want to get to the clothing store, Ive been naked way too long.  I also need a shower.   Yeah, you might want to skip the clothes and get a hotel room, you might have clothes on your back, but nowhere to sleep.   With clothes on my back, I can ask around and find a place to sleep without someone thinking they can rape me.   Touch, Toby said.  Im done, lets go.   Lisa and Toby paid their bill and headed down the mall to the womens clothing store, she walked inside and was greeted by a very over made bitchy salesgirl.  What can I do for you? the clerk asked looking Lisa up and down like a chicken leg.   I need a tank top, pair of shorts, bra and panty set and some flip flops, Lisa replied.   What do you think this is? Old navy? The clerk replied laughing.  We dont sell crap.   Im on a budget, I cant afford some high priced outfit.   From the looks of you, I dont think you need an outfit at all, you look like you just stepped out of the jungle, you Jane?  I dont like your attitude, Lisa said calmly.   I dont like your leg hair, the clerk snapped back.  And your beaver friend here? We dont allow pets in here.   Hes not my pet.   Is that right? the clerk said looking down at Toby.   Toby took a few steps forward and tugged on the clerks dress, Fuck you, he said and yanked it down ripping it at her hip.   The clerk backed up and ran to the register and grabbed a stun gun.  She pointed it at Toby and pulled the trigger striking a rack of shoes behind him.   You suck, Toby said.   The clerk threw the gun at Toby and yelled for the assistant manager to come.  In a few seconds a short fat woman with way too much make up walked up to the clerk and asked what happened.   This rat attacked me! the clerk said.   Is that right? Did you attack her? the assistant manager asked.   No, Toby said.   Ok, get your ass back to work princess, the assistant manager said.  And get that stun gun rolled back up, I dont want the customers tripping over the wires.   Toby looked at the clerk and smiled.  Stupid bitch, he said and was kicked across the room by the clerk and her hard heels.   Toby landed on his back looking up at the ceiling in a daze and struggled to get back up.  It was then he spied an Old Navy down the hall next to a record store.  He had a hard time wondering if he was really conscience since he thought record stores were like dinosaurs.   Are you ok? Lisa asked, she was bent over looking at Toby who was on the floor with his eyes rolling back and forth.  Toby looked up and saw her tits rocking back and forth like to synchronized pendulums.  Once his eyes were locked on her nipples, he couldnt look at anything else.  It was like trying to not look at a car wreck.   Yeah, Ill be fine, help me up, Toby said.   Lisa gave Toby a hand and helped him back up.  For a moment, Toby walked like a drunk beaver with little balance.   Youre so cute when you do that, Lisa said.   Theres an Old Navy down the hall, lets go, Toby said and together they left the store and headed down the hall.   Id save the money for a hotel if I were you, Toby said.        14   Evil Forces      Anne gagged a little when she looked at the umbilical cord lying on the floor until she realized it was a rubber hose painted to look like an umbilical cord complete with fake teeth marks and blue veins.   Thats not real, Anne said to Candye who was now leaning up against the cell door looking out.   So, you figured me out did you? Candye said slow and deliberate.   Not really, I have no idea what youre doing, Anne replied.   Candye continued to stare through the bars into the grey hallway.  Im a messenger from Satan, she said, keeping her eyes locked on the wall across the hall.   And what does old Satan have to say today? Anne asked.   Satan put us in this cell together for a reason, Ive come to deliver a personal message to you about your daughter Lisa.   Anne perked up, What the fuck? she asked.   Lisa is in great danger.   What kind of danger? Anne asked like a concerned mother who hadnt seen her adult daughter in three years.   Shes in a mall with a huge rat, evil forces are all around her, tempting her, trying to take her away.   What kind of evil forces? Anne asked pleading.   Well, for one thing shes hanging out with a giant rat, that cant be good.   What else? Anne asked.   Shes naked, and looking for clothes.   Is she looking for nice clothes? She usually dresses like a slut.   She is in a mini mall, heading for an Old Navy, but there is no Old Navy, the store is still under construction.  She is lost and doesnt know it yet.   Are there any other clothing stores in the mall? Ann asked.   Yes, but they were kicked out of that one, the closest womens store is across the parking lot next to a Taco Bell.   So? Anne asked.   The land the Taco Bell was built on was an old Romanian graveyard, its cursed by the spirit of the man who founded Lancaster.  His bones are still buried under the building.   Lancaster? Where is that? Anne asked.   I dont know for sure, its a lost city, connected by a secret tunnel built by the Romanian founders hundreds of years ago, no one knows for sure where it is.   But Lisa found it somehow, Anne replied.   Yes, her and the rat traveled through the tunnel and are now trapped in the city of Lancaster.   How do I get her back?  If she enters the Taco Bell it wont matter, she wont survive.  Evil spirits have gathered to remove her presence from Lancaster and send her back to Sparksville in a bag, Candy replied.   There is no way I can stop her? Anne pleaded.   A second ago you were telling me I was nuts because I was claiming to have a baby, and now all of a sudden you believe your daughter is going to be killed in a Taco Bell in a town youve never heard of before?  Well, how did you know I had a daughter named Lisa? Anne asked.   Its tattooed on your arm, next to another girl's name.   Why did you choose Lisa instead of Trish? Anne asked.   Why not? Candye replied.   So you just made that all up?  Arent all visions made up?  No, theyre supposed to be divine, not some crap you pulled out of your head.   Well I dont know, it came to me and there you go, Candye replied.  Do with it what you will.   Even if it were true, there isnt a damn thing I can do about it sitting in here, Anne said frustrated.   You put yourself in here, dont bitch.   I know, but I didnt know my daughter was about to be killed in a Taco Bell in a town I never heard of before.   There is one salvation.   What? Another vision?  Yep, be quiet, Im getting one now, Candye said as she stared off blankly.  The huge rat can save your daughter, Im not sure if he will, but there is a chance she may be saved yet.   I wish you knew more about this rat, it really bothers me that shes hanging around with it.    He seems friendly, I wouldnt be worried, if he was going to hurt her, shed be hurt by now.   Thank goodness this might turn out ok, I was so worried for a second there, Anne said.   Dont relax too soon, this might turn out very bad if things dont go just right.  Your daughter is in great peril.   Well thanks for that, just what I needed, I was starting to feel ok about being here and now I think I better bust out.   I wouldnt try that, these places are very secure, Candye said.  Thats why I tried the rubber umbilical cord card, didnt get me anywhere with you, probably wont get me anywhere with the chief.   You admit you faked that? What about eating your baby?  No, I ate my baby, that part is true, Candye replied.   How can you eat your baby? Anne asked, No, dont tell me.   What do you say we talk about something else?  Just then the loud sound of clopping footsteps came walking down the hall.  From the swagger, Anne knew it wasnt the police chief, it was the sheriff, Axl Jackson.  The law enforcement center and jail was co shared by the local police and the county sheriffs department.  The sheriff stopped at Annes cell and motioned for the door to be open.  With a clunk and a clank, the door slid open and the sheriff stepped in.   What do you want now sheriff? Anne asked.   Im not here for you this time, Im here for the cannibal queen, the sheriff replied.   Did you ever find my daughter, Anne asked.   Which one? The slutty one or the druggie?  The slutty one, I know where the druggie one is, Anne replied.   No clue, probably out making a porno is some guys barn.  What do you teach those girls anyway?  Fuck off, Anne said and tried to find a place to sit down not covered in piss.   Miss Kane, the sheriff said.  We need you in court in twenty minutes, the sheriff said.  He tossed another orange jumpsuit at her and said, Put this on, you cant go in front of the judge dressed in piss stains.   Candye caught the jumpsuit and smiled at the sheriff.  Ill piss on this one too, she said dropping it on the floor.  She unzipped the jumpsuit she was wearing, pulled it down to her ankles and squatted down to pee on the clothes the sheriff brought.  When she was done she stood up and zipped up the suit she had on.  There you go, she said pointing to the pissed on heap on the floor.   I figured youd do something like that, he said.  He stepped out of the cell for a moment and walked back in with a clear polyurethane jumpsuit.  Put this on, its pee proof.   You can see right through it, Candye said.   I dont have any more options, this is more to protect the court staff than to make you look good.  I cant have you passing your bodily functions to anyone who might be around.  Youll have to wear this spit guard as well.   Im not wearing that, Candye said defiantly.   Oh, yes you are, the sheriff replied.   Whos going to make me? Candye snapped back.   The sheriff clicked his radio and said, Now.  In a flash a group of five men, dressed in black protective gear rushed the cell and pinned Candye to the ground.  The men stripped her down, put on the plastic suit and spit guard.  Once in place, they put her in wrist cuffs and ankle cuffs.   Get her off the ground, the sheriff said and the men raised her to her feet.  She stood before him dressed only in a see through plastic suit, a spit guard and restraints.  Thats going to get very hot very fast lady, dont try to fight, dont fuck around, any movement will cause you to heat up and you may get heat exhaustion.   Candye looked at the sheriff with anger and disdain, how dare he tie her up? She thought to herself.   Get her out of here, the sheriff said and watched as his men escorted Candye out the cell door and down the hallway to the courtroom.   Sheriff, Anne asked.  Have you ever heard of the town of Lancaster?  The sheriff stood thinking, he knew the answer right away.  Lancaster was wiped off the planet in the tornado of forty two.   No way, where was it before the tornado?  About seventy five miles northeast, the sheriff replied.   Whats there now?  Theres a few buildings, a windmill or two, not much, it was torn to pieces, the sheriff replied.   That woman just told me that Anne was there, in Lancaster.   Why would she be there? There isnt anything there to do, or see.   I dont know, but she sounded pretty sure of herself, is there any way you can check to see if shes there? Anne asked.   No, nobody lives there anymore, there is no one to call, the sheriff replied.   Whats the closest town to Lancaster?  Sparksville, the sheriff replied, and youre standing in the middle of it.   Anne shook her head realizing she put too much faith in Candye and her story.  Never mind, that nutty fruitcake was just putting ideas in my head.   If you hear anything about Lisa, will you let me know? Anne asked.   Sure, tell me something, whats this I hear about you shooting your husband and some gay prostitute? the sheriff asked.   Roger was trying to pick up a John with me in the car that was after he butt fucked some stranger in the womens department at the clothing store.   You didnt know Roger was queer?  No, we had regular sex all the time, he didnt act gay at all, Anne replied.   Thats too bad, I used to kick him out of the men's restrooms down at the city park almost every Saturday night.  He and his friends had quite the operation going on.   What are you talking about? He was down at the fire hall playing cards, Anne said.   No, he was in the toilet stall giving blow jobs to strangers, the sheriff replied.   If thats true, why didnt he ever get caught?  He got caught all the time, but we had to let him go because hes a good friend of the city administrator.   And?  Dont get me wrong, if hed of done that queer shit on county property, Id have busted his queer ass in a second, he was smart, he always did his butt fucking on city property.  That is the citys jurisdiction, not mine.  Im sure the city administrator was in on it, I think at one point they found out he was sneaking out to the public bathrooms in a rental car so he wouldnt get found out.   So the city administrator and my dead husband used to fuck in the public toilet down at the city park? Anne asked in disgust.   Pretty much, sorry to be the one to tell you.   Great, everyone knew but me.   Dont worry about it, hes dead now, you killed the cheating bastard.   Yep, Anne said.  Doesnt change the past.        15   Paddle Boat      Judd sat at a picnic table tied to one of the legs.  Sam brought out some potato salad and set it next to a plate of ham.  I hope you like picnics, she said with a smile.  It was about six oclock and Ricardo and the two other hands had gone back to the barn for supper.  The hogs were tended to for the night.   I do, but just potato salad and ham? Judd asked.   What else do you want?  How about some beans, and some chips?  What do you think this is? A buffet? Sam said with a snarl on her face.   Judd looked over to the hog pen and saw the hog he was talking to earlier, he didnt get his name.  He could tell by the hogs expression that he had better cool down before he ended up as livestock feed.  No, thats fine, ham and potato salad are fine.   Stop lying to me, Sam said.  You want fucking beans, Ill make you fucking beans! she shouted loud enough for the hogs to stop snorting and take notice.   I dont want your fucking beans! Judd shouted back.   Sam walked around to where Judd was sitting and sat on the table top letting her boots rest on the bench seat.  How many times do you want to do it tonight? she asked.   Zero, Judd replied.   Dont fuck with me asshole, now give me a number I can use.   Fifty, Judd said being an ass.   Fifty? I can give that a shot, no promises, Sam said running her finger over Judds ear.  You want to look up my skirt? she asked.   No, Judd asked.   I think we should do it on this table once were done eating, she said.   I dont want to get splinters in my knees.   You bitch about everything dont you?  Can I go home now? Judd asked.   This is your home now, Sam replied.   Bullshit, my family is worried about me, you need to get your henchmen off my back and untie me.   You said wed fuck fifty times, youre not going anywhere till I collect all fifty, Sam said.   Why dont you fuck one of your help? I bet theyd help you out.   Ive tried, I dont think they get my hints.   Dont be so subtle, walk over to the barn naked and point at your coochie, theyll get it.   I tried that once, they gave me a glass of milk and pointed me to the bathroom, I think they thought I had a yeast infection, Sam said disappointed.   Well Im sorry, no, actually Im not, if you werent such a freak, youd find a man.  Hell, you came up to me yesterday wearing a wrestling unitard, what woman does that? Who wants to be with a woman who dresses like a high school wrestler?  You dont think Im feminine enough? Sam asked.   You make my dick limp if thats what you mean, Judd replied.   Maybe I should put on a pretty dress, and some lipstick.   Maybe you should, and while you're at it, call a surgeon to fix that flab hanging off your pussy.  Thats a huge turn off.   I dont like your attitude, Sam said.  I think you may need an adjustment.   What does that mean?  Wait here, Sam said knowing he was tied to the hundred pound table.   Judd ate ham and potato salad while Sam was inside.  It was a nice evening and there was a cool breeze blowing in.  Then she returned with a whip in her hand.   What are you doing with that? Judd asked.   Im going to whip you into a better attitude, Sam replied.   You think whipping me will make me like you better? Judd asked.   I dont need you to like me, I need you to fuck me, now bend over the table, and this is going to hurt like hell.   Sam pulled back on the whip and it didnt go far.  She wasnt tall enough to make the nine foot whip do anything but lie on the ground.  She tried different ways to get it to whip but it just dragged around kicking up dirt.  Fuck, how do you do this? she asked.   I think its broke, Judd said.  Better put it back where you found it.   It's not broke, Ive seen Ricardo use it before.   Not wanting her to get Ricardo, Judd had to think fast.  Its a Mexican style bullwhip, only Mexicans can use it, and only on Mexican bulls.  Its a tradition, dont fuck with it.   Really? Sam said.  I had no idea.   Yeah, put it back in the house.  You dont want to ruin it, probably worth a lot of money.  Those are made of quality leather.   How do you know? Sam asked.   Look at it, Judd said.   You can tell by looking?  How else can you tell?  Satisfied, Sam took the whip back to the house and came back with a belt.  Horrified, Judd couldnt think of anything clever to say about that.   I found this belt, I think it will work better, now lean forward, she said.  Judd leaned forward and Sam began striking the belt across his back over and over.  Then she realized shed get a bigger bang for her buck if she raised his shirt so she stepped over and just as she got there, Judd spun around and grabbed her by the arm and pulled the belt from her hand.   You fucking bitch! Judd yelled and pulled her into the table slamming her head on the hard wood seat.  He was still tied to the table but now had the knife from Sams tool belt and used it to cut the cord that kept him prisoner.  In a flash, he was untied and running down the path to the driveway that led to the gravel road towards town.       Sam rolled over and felt blood on her face, she was dazed and pissed at the same time.  By now Judd was past the house and on his way to the road, she had to get him back before he got away and turned her in for kidnapping.  She scrambled to her feet and ran to the horse pen, there wasnt time to saddle one, but she did grab a lasso that was hanging on a peg and mounted her horse Paddle boat.  Once atop her horse, she took off in a gallop towards the house and Judd who was now past the mailbox.   Judd was exhausted but knew he couldnt let up, he knew shed follow him so he looked for places he could use to ditch her, like a ditch.  As he ran, he saw endless landscapes of farmland with little to use to hide.  Everywhere he looked it was corn, or milo, surrounded by barb wire fences and drainage ditches.  There really was nowhere to hide.   Then he heard the clip clop sounds of a horse behind him, he turned to look as he ran and saw Sam spinning her lasso readying herself for an attempt to rope him in mid run.  Fuck he said winded and ran into the ditch trying to throw her off, as his feet left the gravel and touched the grass of the ditch he felt the lasso hit his head with a thump and fall to the ground.  He knew she missed.   Down into the ditch and up the other side Judd ran till he got to the barb wire fence, it would take a minute to pull the wires apart so he could get through, a minute that Sam could use to make another attempt.  As he pulled, he tried to keep his hands off the barbs and was shocked at how tight the wires were and how close they were to each other.  How the fuck was he going to get through? His only other option was to try to crawl over the top and that meant scraping the shit out himself on the way over.   Then he felt the lasso grab him and tighten as it pulled him backwards, away from the fence and down into the ditch.  She got him, and how he was being dragged back onto the gravel road scraping the shit out of his exposed skin.  About thirty feet more and the horse stopped and Judd lay there in agony.  He was sandpapered on the bottom and the rope dug in and pulled so hard his joints felt like they were going to give way.   Sam dismounted and ran over to Judd who was still lying on the ground bound tight.  Where do you think youre going? she yelled.  She still had blood on her face.   Judd looked up at her and didnt say a word.   Sam kicked Judd in the side and yelled again, You better talk to me asshole! Where were you going?  Back to town you stupid bitch! Judd snapped back.   Oh no you arent, not after what you did back there.  You hit a woman, what kind of creepy asshole hits a woman?  What kind of psycho bitch chases a guy with a horse and ties him up like a cow?  Psycho bitch? Sam said laughing.  You dont know anything about me.   I know enough, Judd said.   Do you have a psychology degree?  No, I dont need one, anyone can tell your nuts.   Sam stood there looking down at Judd, she didnt know how she was going to get him back to the farm, she cant drag him all the way, hed die, and he wasnt going back on his own, now what? Get up, were going back to the farm, She said.   Judd stood up and let the lasso fall to the ground, he was covered on his backside by gravel and blood.  Im not going back, I never should have ran in the first place, all you have is a rope and a horse, unless you have your Mexicans in your back pocket, Ill be heading for the nearest hospital.   Wait, Sam said, now more subdued and coy, Let me help.   Judd looked at her like she had just turned into a pumpkin, What? he asked like she was a big hairy joke, You did this to me, why the hell should I let you help?  Im sorry, I didnt mean to hurt you, I was scared.   Yeah, scared I was going to turn your ass in for kidnapping, which I still am.   You dont have to do that.   I dont have to do a lot of things, but that I am, now leave me alone.   I can get Ricardo, hell hunt you down if I ask, you might as well give up, Sam said.   What happened to being sorry? Judd asked.   I am sorry, do you think I wanted to hurt you? I love you.   No, actually I dont think you wanted to hurt me, you were scared and did the first knee jerk thing you could think of, and no, you dont love me, youre a nutjob that thinks you love me, now goodbye, Judd said turning to leave.   No! Dont leave me! I want to have your babies! Sam yelled.   Judd turned and looked back.   I want to marry you and have lots of kids.   I need surgery, I think I ruptured something, now get the fuck away from me, go back to your hogs and leave me alone.   Disappointed, Sam walked over to Judd and raised her shirt exposing her breasts, You dont want to give these up do you? she asked.   Trying to lure me back with sex wont work, Im so fucked up right now that I can barely walk, let alone have sex, so cover those up and leave me alone.   Fine, Sam said.  She turned and walked back to her horse leaving Judd behind.   Judd turned and slowly walked down the gravel road towards town.  The road burns from being scraped along the gravel were now so painful that every step was agony.  But he knew he had to get to town and get his wounds looked at, he was going to get a raging infection with all the exposed and torn up skin.   I suppose youll call the sheriff on me, Sam said.  Go ahead, do what you want, I dont need you anyway.  she said turning her horse back to town.  She got the horse up to speed in a trot and left Judd behind.  He turned back to see her leave and then back to the long road ahead.  He had to walk six miles back to town and didnt know if hed make it.  The only reason why she let him go was probably because she knew it as well and would come back later with her Mexicans to pick him up off the road.   Then he noticed the vultures above circling.  These werent for me? he asked himself, Shit, Im not that bad off.        16   Madam Jane      Toby and Lisa left the mall and headed towards the Old Navy, then they noticed the Under construction sign and were both disappointed.   Fuck, now what? Lisa asked.   Lets keep looking around, Toby said and they kept walking down the polished floor looking at the different shops.  Then Toby saw something that made him freak.  Look, its one of those psychic palm reading places! he said like a giddy school boy.  Can we go in? he asked like he was asking his mother for candy.   Those places are so fake, Id rather not, Lisa said.   I know theyre fake, but I want to try, it will be fun.   Lisa stood there thinking, What the hell, but I cant spend any of my money, I need it for clothes.   I have some money, Toby said.   Where did you get money? Lisa asked.   I took some tip money off the table at the Chinese place, got five bucks.   Five bucks wont get you far in that place.   Together, the two walked over to the psychic shop and went inside.  They looked at the price list and Toby was very disappointed.  The cheapest thing on the list was a palm reading for thirty five dollars.   Then a clerk came out from the back.  May I help you? she asked.   No, I was just looking, Toby said disappointed.   We have a special today, readings are twenty dollars.   I only have five, Toby said.  Sorry to bother you.   No, you arent bothering me, I can make you a deal, today we will run a special just for you, and we dont get many rats in here.   Im not a rat, Im a beaver, Toby said.   Oh, I am very sorry, I meant for beavers, let me get Madam Jane for you, the clerk said.   In a minute, Madam Jane appeared wearing what looked like a modified Gypsy costume complete with a head bandana and earrings that hung six inches off her ear.  When she looked at Toby, her eyes lit up like she had just seen a million dollars.  Hello, I hear there is a beaver looking for a reading? she asked.   Yes, but I only have five dollars, Toby said.   You can talk? Madam Jane asked.   Yeah, is that surprising? Toby asked.   Ive been searching for a talking beaver for years, does he belong to you? Madam Jane asked Lisa.   No, he owns himself, Lisa replied with a smile.   Are you sure, I will buy him from you.   Im sure, I dont own him.   Have a seat, both of you, Madam Jane said excited.  I have a proposition for you.  she said to Lisa  What? Lisa replied.   I will get you back to where you came from in exchange for the talking beaver.   What do you mean where I came from?  Sparksville, I can get you back there.   How do you know about Sparksville? Lisa asked.   Im psychic, did you read the sign on the door? Madam Jane asked.   How can you get me back there?  I have a doorway, a doorway that leads to where ever I point it.  I can point it back to Sparksville and you can be home, all I ask is the talking beaver.   Toby spoke up, Why are you talking like Im not here?  Yeah, I dont own Toby, I cant give him to you, Lisa said.   How badly do you want to go home? Madam Jane asked.   Real bad, I have like ninety dollars, maybe more like eighty, can I buy my way back?  No, I dont want your money, I need the talking beaver.   Just out of curiosity, what do you plan to do with Toby if I could give him to you?  I can cast a spell with the tail of a talking beaver, a spell so great it would make me invincible.   Invincible to what? This isnt a Disney cartoon.   Thats for me to know, Ive said too much as it is, Madam Jane said.   Toby spoke up again, Beaver tail?  Madam Jane ignored Toby and looked to Lisa.  I can have you back home in minutes, all you have to do is give me your beaver! she shouted.   Hes not mine to give! Lisa shouted back, Get your own talking beaver!  Madam Jane stood up and slammed her hand on the table, You stupid girl, youll be trapped here forever!  Lisa shook her head and looked at Toby.  Lets get out of here, she said.   Yeah, Toby said like he was in a fog.  Lets get out before I lose my tail.   Both Lisa and Toby stood up and turned to leave when they saw the front door shut on its own.  They heard the click of the lock and knew they were fucked.  Whats going on? Toby asked.   That psychic bitch locked us in, Lisa said.   We have to find a way out, Toby said.  Try to break the glass with the chair.   Lisa picked up the chair and began beating the door with it, nothing, it bent the chair but the door was undamaged.   Then they heard Madam Jane from behind.  Come with me, she said pointing behind the black curtains.   Lisa was hesitant, but she knew she was trapped anyway, so she followed the psychic to the back.  Toby followed but kept close to Lisa.   Let me show you something, Madam Jane said.  She walked to the back of the shop and pointed to a door that was closed.  The room was dark and the walls were painted black, but the outline of the door was plainly visible.   What? Lisa asked.   Stay back, if you get too close, Ill lock the door and take your beaver and kill you.  Madam Jane said.  She stepped lightly towards the door and unlocked it.  She opened the door slowly revealing the outside of the building, only instead of what they thought theyd see, they saw a familiar landmark of Sparksville, it was the city park with the Sparksville water tower in the distance.  Now Lisa knew she could get home.  See that? That is proof that I can get you home, thats Sparksville.   Lisa looked out the door and immediately recognized the landscape, she didnt need the water tower to know that was home.   All you have to do is give me your beaver and you can walk out that door and be home, Madam Jane said.   What happens to Toby if I do? Lisa asked.   I told you, I use his tail for a spell.   What about the rest of him?  What about it?  Do you have to kill him to use his tail?  Of course silly girl,  Why? You can take his tail without killing him, all you need is his tail! Lisa shouted.   Madam Jane had to think about this, she always assumed shed have to kill a beaver if she found one, what beaver would give up its tail voluntarily? Maybe I can let the beaver live, if it gives up its tail.   See, there is a compromise, Lisa said.   Toby spoke up, Why do you two act like Im not here?  Lisa looked down at Toby, Would you be willing to give up your tail so I can get home?  You want me to let that nutjob chop off my tail? You trust her? Toby asked.   Actually Toby, I dont know what to think anymore, I want to go home, I dont know anyone here and I dont want to live my life in Lancaster.   Id rather not lose my tail, Toby said.   Lisa let out of breath and looked out the door at Sparksville.  She really wanted to go home.  Ok, you can have the beaver, she said.   What? Toby said.   Im going home, I cant stay here any longer.   Madam Jane spoke up, Can I get that in writing?  Just take the fucking rat and let me go, Lisa said.   Fine, have the beaver get in my cage before you go, Madam Jane said.   No, I said you can have him, you put him in your cage, and Im done.   Madam Jane shut the door and the room got much darker.  Put the beaver in the cage, or no Sparksville, she said.   Lisa walked over to the door and put her hand on the knob, Madam Jane didnt try to stop her.  Lisa opened the door and what she saw was a set of stairs leading to a basement.  No Sparksville.  What are you? A witch?  Yes, Madam Jane replied.   Why cant you put Toby in the cage?  I cant touch it before the spell or it will ruin everything.   Then do your fucking spell now and get it over with, Lisa said.   It takes preparations, I didn't expect you two to walk in the door today.   Get a cleaver and chop his fucking tail off, it isnt that hard, stick it in a zip lock bag and put it in fridge.  Use tongs if you dont want to touch it.  Stop wasting my time and get me home.   It doesnt work that way, Madam Jane said.   Ill toss your ass down those stairs if you dont get me home, you got me? Lisa said pissed.   Dont threaten me, Madam Jane said.  I have a spell of protection upon me that keeps me from harm.   Lisa grabbed Madam Jane by her robe and shoved her up against the door jam, she looked down at the steps and said, Lets test that spell, and shoved the psychic down the stairs into the dark below.   You were going to let her cut off my tail? Toby asked.   Im so pissed now I cant think straight, I had the chance to go home and now Im fucked.   No youre not, Madam Jane said from the back of the room, I told you I had a spell that protected me.   How did you get up the stairs so fast? Toby asked.   I didnt go down the stairs, Madam Jane replied.   Anyway, just cut off my fucking tail so she can go home!  Madam Jane ignored Toby.  Whats wrong? Im talking to you bitch!  Yeah, why wont you talk to Toby? Lisa asked.   Madam Jane didnt answer the question, instead she said, Put the beaver in the cage and you can go home, its that simple.   How do I know youll let me go? Lisa asked.   You dont, but what choice do you have? Who else is going to get you home?  Lisa knew she was right, how else was she going to get home.  Fine, she said and picked up Toby.  Wheres the cage?  Madam Jane made a motion with her hand and a cage appeared on the floor.  Stick him in that, she said.  And lock the door when hes inside.   Lisa put Toby in the cage and the door behind her opened wide.  It was Sparksville lighting up the room with a cool breeze blowing inside.  She looked down at Toby, Im sorry, I have to go,  Toby looked up through the cage with a tear in his beaver eye, Just go, have a happy life, he said and Lisa ran out the door back to where she started from.  Still naked, but happy.        17   Adult diaper      Lisa ran through the door stark naked and was immediately picked up by the cops for indecent exposure and hauled to jail.  Once booked, she was brought down to a holding cell where she met her mother and a woman she had never met before wearing an adult diaper cuffed to the wall.   Mom, what are you doing here? Lisa asked.  And why is she wearing a diaper?  I have bad news honey, I shot your father and killed him, Anne replied.   What the hell? Why?  He was trying to pick up a male prostitute while I was in the car, Anne replied.   Oh, so you found out?  I suppose you knew all along? Anne asked.   Yeah, since I was fourteen, I still remember the day I found out.   Tell me about it, I want to know how I was so blind.   Lisa hesitated, she felt like she had betrayed her mother for all these years and now had to confess, but looking in her eyes, she knew she had to tell her the truth.  Alright, Im sorry I didnt tell you before, but I remember walking in on dad and the dishwasher guy fucking in your bed.   Dishwasher guy? Anne asked thinking hard.  Then she remembered, That was like eight years ago, when the wash cycle dial quit working.   All I remember was walking in you room looking for something and seeing dad on top of this guy humping and making noises like he had asthma.  It was really gross.  I didnt make a sound and backed out and watched the rest through the crack between the door and the door jam.   It grossed you out but you still watched? Anne asked.   How couldnt I? Two grown men raping each other? It was sort of a turn on, I was going through puberty you know mom, I do have hormones.   Why didnt you tell me? Anne asked.   I didnt want you to know I watched dad butt rail the dishwasher guy, Id get in trouble.   Did you ever see him do it again?  Not to that guy, but while you were at work, hed have guys over in the garage all the time.  He kept the door locked but I knew what he was doing.   Who else knew?  Trish, and all our friends, and most of the neighbors, Lisa replied.   I dont know how Im supposed to feel about this, Anne said.   Then Candye chimed in, Did he ever fuck you?  Anne looked over at Candye and shook her head no.  I just thought he didnt like sex.   What man doesnt like sex? Candye asked.  Did you ever consider he was having an affair with another woman?  The thought crossed my mind, but never really seemed interested in other women.  Makes sense now, but back then I thought he just liked woodworking.   Oh he liked working wood alright, just not the kind you were thinking about, Candye laughed.   Shut up baby eater, Anne said.   Lisa looked at her mother funny and asked, Baby eater? What are you talking about?  Oh our friend here is here for eating her baby, sick bitch.   Seriously? Thats fucked up, and whats with the diaper? Lisa asked.   She pissed herself and said her water broke, was going to have the baby she ate.   Lisa shook her head in disbelief, What people will say these days.   What about you? Anne asked.  I heard you were out taking naked pictures in the woods with some photographer.   Yeah, not anymore, Ive been out hanging with a beaver, Lisa replied.   A beaver or your beaver? Anne asked.   A beaver, named Toby.   You went to the pet store and bought a beaver? Anne asked.   No, he owns his own place, has a college degree, oh no, he said he dropped out, anyway, me and him have been hanging ever since I got caught by those hillbillies.   Do I want to hear this? Anne asked.   Ill explain later, but I do want to say I dig this jumpsuit they gave me, I was tired of being naked all the time, Lisa said.   So why are you here? Anne asked.   Indecent exposure, Lisa replied.  It was the hillbillies.   You weren't taking naked pictures in front of a school were you? Anne asked.   No mother, we were out in the country, we were captured and they took all my clothes, Ive been running around naked ever since.   Wheres your friend? The perv with the camera?  Last I knew he was jerking off into a cup in the basement of the house they were keeping us in.  I escaped and never looked back.  I found Toby and the rest is history.   And you think my story is fucked up? Candye said.  A beaver who's a college dropout? Give me a fucking break.   Its true, I have no reason to lie, Lisa said.   Where is your friend Toby now? Candye asked with a sardonic grin.   I had to leave him with a witch so I could get home.   Leave him?  I dont want to talk about it, Lisa said with a tear welling up in her eye.  By now Toby was dead and the witch was using his tail to cast a spell for ultimate power.   You have plenty of time, none of us are going anywhere soon, Candye said.   How did your court turn out? Anne asked Candye.   Candye hesitated to reply, then said, Bunch of fucking bullshit if you ask me.   Go on, do tell, Anne said.   The public defender is a prick, I dont think he said two words to me, he talked to the judge like he knew me or something.  Every time I tried to speak up and defend myself, he told me to sit the fuck down and shut my face.   What were you doing that made him do that? Anne asked.   The other lawyer kept calling me a fucking psycho nut case, I took offense to that, Im no nutcase, and Im the smartest person in that room.   Two college educated lawyers and a judge are dumber than you? Anne asked.   Thats book smarts, I have real life smarts, Candye replied.  I know more about life than all three of them combined, and told them as much.   So what happened?  Fucking judge gave me contempt of court, said I had to serve three more days and pay a five hundred dollar fine.  I told him to stop molesting kids.   I bet that helped your case, Anne said.   Fuck him, and fuck you bitch, Candye said.   You really dont know how to interact in social situations do you.  Anne said.  You have a lawyer for a reason, use them, dumb ass.   Oh, you didnt hear the best part, they had three guards jump my ass, Candye said with a smile.  Took three of those bastards to cuff me.  See whos tough now?  Why did they do that?  After the judge gave me the fine, I took off running towards the bench.  I got to this gavel and through it at him, missed the fucker.   Is that why you're cuffed to that pole? Anne asked.   Maybe, I dont know, Candye replied.  They didnt say much to me after they hauled me back here.   I know, I was here, trying to sleep, Anne said.  When do you go back to court?  Who knows? Candye said shaking her head in disgust.  I dont plan on seeing the outside for a long long time anyway.   Lisa spoke up, Mom, what are they going to do with you?  Probably a hearing, then a trial, then the chair, Im supposed to meet with my lawyer today sometime.  Ill find out then.   Can you plead self-defense? Lisa asked.   No, I shot him because he lied and cheated on me, I knew what I was doing, Anne replied.   So I suppose insanity isnt an option,  Nope, I knew where the gun was and I used it, Anne said.   You act like you're proud of yourself.   I am, for once I took charge and didnt let someone fuck me over.  Ive never said once I didnt do this and if it happened again, Id shoot that fucker again.   Thats my dad youre talking about, Lisa said.   I know, Im sorry honey that it turned out like this.  Maybe if you had told me years ago I could have divorced the fucker and lived a normal life, Anne said.   Youre blaming me? Lisa asked.   In part yes, you could have told me and this never would have happened.   Thats a pretty big load to dump on me mom, Im not to blame for what dad was doing, Lisa snapped back.   But you are responsible for not telling me what you knew.   Lisa stepped away from her mother and sat down on the cold hard aluminum bench.  She was quiet and stared blankly at the floor.   Dont get all sentimental now Lisa, dont act like your dad was a good man, I dont think he loved me, or you or Trish for that matter.  Did he ever come to your school events? Did he ever make time for anyone but himself? He whored me out at the diner so he could pay for men to have sex with, come on Lisa, dont act like Im the bad guy here.   Were all to blame, Lisa said.  But now hes dead and there is no going back.   Candye spoke up, I have to pee, can one of you call a jailor?  Use the diaper, Anne said, They put it on for a reason.   Yeah, if I tried to piss on the floor, but Im telling you I have to go to the bathroom, I dont want to piss on the floor.  Please call someone.   Anne stepped over to the bars and yelled, Hey, we need someone down here!  Did they hear you? Candye asked.   How should I know?  I feel it coming, I cant wait much longer, Candye said crossing her legs and bouncing up and down.   Quit bouncing, that cant help, Anne said.   Oh fuck, Candye said, Too late, and the piss ran into her diaper and spread across her jail jumpsuit and down to the floor by her feet.   Those diapers dont work very well, Anne said.   Lisa looked up and Candye and replied, They are designed to be worn under the clothes, not on top, thats why shes peeing on the floor.  Dumbass guards dont know how to put a diaper on.   Then a booming voice from outside the jail cell.  My guards arent wet nurses, theyre trained jailors, diapers aren't our thing.  said the police chief.  Looks like I need to get you a mop again.   If you treated us like human beings instead of animals this wouldn't happen, who puts a diaper on a grown woman and cuffs her to a pipe? What do you expect? Shes nowhere near the toilet, Anne said.   Whats done is done, Ill get a custodian and a new uniform, dont you worry your pretty little head now missy, the chief said.   Anne shook her head at the chief and didnt reply, her snarky look was enough to get her point across.  The police chief remained stone faced, but she was pretty sure she got through to him, especially after throwing in an eye roll when she was done.  She almost expected to feel the chief grab her by the throat and beat her head against the bars, but no, he walked away not saying a word.        18   47 Ford      Judd walked back to the gas station and entered the front door.  Standing at the counter was the same women he met two days before, it was Bernice.  She didnt bother to look up when the ding sounded from the door chime, it was like she was deaf.  Judd admired the retro look of the place with old pin up pictures on the wall and a stack of 1950s oil cans stacked on display.  Do you still have my cell phone? Judd asked looking down at Bernice.   She looked up from her crossword puzzle book and looked Judd in the eye.  Its still plugged in behind the counter, you can come around and get it.   Judd walked around the counter and unplugged his phone.  He wrapped the cord and stuck it in his pocket.  You rent cars right? he asked.   Yes, she replied.   What I really need is a ride back to Sparksville, I cant return the car once I get there, is there anyone here that could give me a ride? Id pay for their time and gas.   Bernice didnt hesitate, she picked up the phone and called to the back, Send Rachelle out, she said and hung up the phone.   Judd waited patiently for this Rachelle to appear and when he did he was shocked and amazed.  She was a tall, leggy, teenage girl with long brown hair wearing a mini skirt and heels.  She looked like she had walked out of a porn magazine.   Rachelle, this guy needs a ride to Sparksville, get the pick up and take him please, Bernice said.  Rachelle made a face like she was just asked to do the dishes, it was obvious she didnt want to play cab driver.  Dont worry about her, shes a real bitch, a lazy bitch.  Shes my granddaughter, love her to death, but she spends all her time on her phone chatting with boys.   Judd felt his pants bulge and was glad Bernice couldn't see over the counter.  What happened to the lady that kidnapped me? Judd asked passing time.   In the freezer, Bernice said.   What? Judd asked.   Cops came, I told them she took off.  Sounded plausible since she had a dead body crammed into her trunk.   What are you going to do with the body? Judd asked.   Supper tonight, she replied.  Youre ride is ready, she said pointing out the window.  Rachelle was driving the truck to the front door.   How much for the ride? Judd asked.   Free, you brought us supper, I think its a fair trade.   Awesome, Judd said turning to the front door.   Whatever you do, dont try anything with Rachelle, Im not saying that to protect her, Im saying that to protect you, Bernice said looking at the obvious boner sticking his pants out.   Judd got in the passengers seat of a 1947 Ford pickup truck.  In the drivers seat was Rachelle who had just put on a darker shade of lipstick.  She looked like a pinup model from head to painted toe nails.   Did grandma tell you not to try to fuck me? Rachelle asked.   Something like that, Judd replied.   Old bat, I never have any fun with her around.   Shes not around now, Judd said hoping for a clear message that it was alright to try to get up her skirt.   I dont fuck just anyone you know, I have standards, she said driving off onto the highway.   Im sure you do, we all do, Judd said.   I dont like guys that try too hard, looks pathetic.  I also dont like guys who are shorter than me.   That must be tough, how tall are you? Six foot? Judd asked.   Six two, Rachelle replied.   That dont leave a lot of men, Judd said.  Im six three, he added to make sure she knew he qualified.   Do you smoke? she asked.   Hoping to get the answer she wanted, he replied, No, but sometimes if Im at a party. . .   I hate smokers, smell like shit, brown teeth, gross, Id never fuck a smoker, she said.   Like I said, I dont smoke, Judd said.   You do at parties, why is that? Who are you trying to impress? Rachelle asked.   Judd watched the road fly by and tried to come up with a good lie.  I was trying to fit in, he said looking for some sympathy.  Why do you wear the clothes you wear? he asked.   Are you some sort of rapist? Going to claim I made you rape me because of what Im wearing?  No, not at all, Im making a point that we all want to fit in, if you didnt you could be wearing a potato sack instead of a skirt and bear skins instead of that shirt.  Dont pin me into some group of crazies, you do the same thing, Judd snapped back pissed, now he knew he wasnt getting laid.   What I wear is none of your business, Rachelle stated as a matter of fact.   What I do at parties is my business, Judd replied in the same tone.   For a while both were silent as they headed towards Sparksville.  It was an awkward tense quiet.   Are you a vampire? Judd asked.   Yes, Rachelle replied.  Nothing else, she kept her eyes glued to the road.   Whats that like?  It is what it is.   How old are you? You look sixteen, Judd asked.   If I look sixteen, why are you gawking at me like you want to fuck the shit out of me?  Can you answer my question without all the drama?  Im two hundred and forty eight years old, she replied.  Old enough to know when Im being toyed with by a creep.   How much further till Sparksville? Judd asked pissed.   Sixty miles, Rachelle replied.   Maybe Ill take a nap, Judd said leaning back in his seat.   Avoid me all you want, your still a creep.   Look bitch, you dont know me.   I know your type, Rachelle replied.   My type? Now youre stereotyping me? Well, I know your type too, Judd replied.   Rachelle began to laugh, Really, tell me mister, what is my type?  Youre a cock tease, looking for attention and getting pissed off when you dont get it.  Surprised you havent been raped yet.   What makes you think I havent been?  I was right, told you so, Judd said.   Just then Judd heard a sound from the bed of the truck, it was the rustling of metal on metal.  What do you have back there? Judd asked.  He turned to see Sam in the back holding a steel pipe ready to bash in the back window.  Holy shit, watch out! Judd said as the pipe crashed through the rear window sending glass all over the cab.   Rachelle grabbed the pipe and pulled hard with her super vampire strength.  She managed to pull the pipe loose and set it on the floor.  Take the wheel, she said and put Judds hand on the steering wheel.  She then rolled down her window and crawled out.  With a quick leap, she was in the back of the truck face to face with Sam.   Judd moved over to the drivers seat and took over control of the truck.  The first thing he thought to do was slow down and pull over, but he didnt know how to work the gears and didnt want to cause the truck to crash.  He had to keep it a sixty miles an hour till Rachelle came back.   In the rear, Rachelle stood tall waiting for Sam to attack again, this time Sam had a metal chain that she swung around like her lasso ready to strike.  Round and round the chain spun until Rachelle grabbed hold and pulled the chain and Sam towards her flinging her off the truck onto the highway.  Rachelle watched Sam flip and flop and come to a rest as the distance between them increased.  Stupid bitch, Rachelle said and got back in the truck, this time in the passengers side.   You killed her! Judd said.   It was self-defense, Rachelle replied.   No, Im pissed I didnt get too, Im jealous.   You knew her?  Yeah, she kidnapped me and raped me, and tried to get me to feed her hogs, Judd replied.   A woman raped you? Thats a joke, Rachelle said.   Im not a bad looking man, Judd replied, Some women find me attractive,  That thing may have been a woman, but she was no better than her hogs from what I saw, Rachelle said.   Shut the fuck up, I may have hated her for what she did, but at least she thought I was attractive enough to do it too.   That woman probably has twenty vibrators in her bed drawer and an industrial size package of batteries.  She would fuck any man that she could, dont impress yourself.   Ive had enough of your put downs, now are you going to leave her body back there? Thats leaving the scene of an accident, Judd said.   I dont care.   Why dont you care?  So what do you do in Sparksville? Rachelle asked.   Im a writer and photographer at the paper, Judd replied.   Really? Have you met anyone famous?  Not nationally, I did cover the election last year and met the vice president when he was campaigning.   No, I mean like movie stars, or singers.   Just locals, Judd replied.   What kinds of stories do you write?  Local news, food drives, accidents, stuff like that, Judd replied.   That sound hideously dull, Rachelle said.   It helps pay my bills, Judd said.   You have a second job?  I do portrait photography on the side, I was doing a shoot when I was kidnapped.   Sounds interesting,  It was, I was about to do a full nude shoot for this hot girl when these two hillbillies kidnapped us.   Did you try to fuck her? Rachelle asked.   No, I didnt, but the hillbillies wanted too.   Did they?  I dont think so, but they might have.   How did you escape? Rachelle asked.   The girl got away and they didnt want to leave me behind so they tied me up and put me in the car.  Then we got pulled over for having that dead body crammed into the trunk and here I am.   I see, do you want to fuck now? Rachelle asked.   Why now? Judd asked.   You were dull before, now I find you interesting and that turns me on.   I dont know now, you look sixteen, but youre over two hundred, youre hot and gross at the same time.  And you just killed Sam which is sort of a turn off.   You got one chance, if you want me Ill pull over onto a gravel road and let you have your way with me while Im still interested.   How long do I have to decide? Judd asked.   Ill give you ten minutes, and each minute you make me wait, the less I want you inside me.   Fine, pull over, Judd said.        19   3 Months later      Anne stood before the court at her sentencing hearing, she had plead no contest to second degree murder and was now ready to hear her fate.  She stood alone, as she was her own defender, the judge looked down upon her.   In the case of the state versus Anne Marie, the court has found you guilty on two counts of second degree murder, both charges carry a maximum sentence of forty years to life without parole.  It is this court's decision that you serve two forty year sentences consecutively with no parole, at the Sparksville correctional facility.  This sentence is to take effect immediately.   Sitting in the gallery was Judd, now working in the capacity of a reporter/photographer.  In the front row was his former model and Annes daughter Lisa who was in tears.  The bailiff and his staff escorted Anne out of the courtroom and into the hall to the waiting police van parked outside.   The galley cleared and Judd made a point to run into his former model Lisa who he hadnt spoken to since the kidnapping.  Hi, he said as if it were yesterday.  Sorry to hear about your mom.   Are you writing for the paper? Lisa asked.   Yeah, Im assigned to court cases.   What are you going to say about my mother? Lisa asked.   Just the facts, what else would I write? Judd asked.   Ive read the articles in the paper, and the editorials, your paper is a piece of shit!  Judd waited a second before he replied.  I didnt write those articles, and Im not an editor, I only cover what happens in the court room.   Same thing, youre all fuckers, Lisa said looking like she wanted to lash out.  Are you interviewing me now? Is this conversation going in that rag of a paper of yours?  No, of course not, if we were doing an interview, Id ask first, Judd said.  I just wanted to stop and say hi, its been three months since we were kidnapped.  I never heard the story of what happened to you.   By now the hall had cleared and only Judd and Lisa were left.  It was an old courthouse, with wood floors and high ceilings.  I should write a book about it, you wouldnt believe it if I told you, Lisa said.   Same here, You want to get some coffee? Id love to chat with you about it.   No, I have to see my mother, before they put her in prison.   Judd looked out the window and saw the police van drive down the street.  They took her already, see? he asked pointing out the window.   Lisa watched the van drive away and head towards the womens prison.  She knew shed see her mother again, but she was on an emotional roller coaster.  Yeah, we can get some coffee, Lisa said.   On the way out of the courtroom, Judd and Lisa had to stop when they saw the police escorting a large man in chains down the hall towards the judges offices.  The man turned and looked at Judd and Lisa and smiled.  It gave them both the creeps.  For some reason, the man had a familiarity about him that Lisa couldnt shake.   Who is that? Lisa asked.   Hes on my list for this afternoon in court, his name is Eric Larson, on trial for beating his estranged wife to death.   Why did he look at me like that? Lisa asked.   Maybe you remind him of her?  No, I recognize him, or something about him, the way he walked, or the way his face looked, I cant put my finger on it, Lisa said.   Says here hes from Denton, you been to Denton? Judd asked.   No, but that dont mean shit, people get around, I know I know him.   Come back to court after lunch and sit in on the trial, Ill be in the front row, Judd said.       One in the afternoon and Judd and Lisa are sitting in the gallery for the trial of Eric Larson accused of the murder of his wife Estelle.   All rise, the bailiff said and everyone rose while the judge took his seat.   You may be seated, the judge said.  Call your first witness, he said to the prosecution.   A young lawyer in a sharp grey suit stood and said, The prosecution calls Abigayle Johnson to the stand.   Abigayle walked to the witness stand and took the oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help her God, she sat down and leaned close to the microphone.   Then the prosecutor stepped in close and asked, Mrs.  Johnson, are you married?  Yes, she replied.   How long have you been married?  About forty five years now, she replied.   So that puts you at about what age?  Im seventy two years old, Mrs.  Johnson replied.   Mrs.  Johnson, when exactly did you stop menstruating?  Oh, Id say about 1987,  Then a voice from the defenders table.  I object your honor, this line of questioning is absurd.   The judge spoke up, Where exactly are you going with this Mr.  Prosecutor?  We are trying to establish that at the murder scene there was a large amount of blood in the carpet and on the walls.  We want to show that the blood did not in fact come from the landlady Mrs.  Johnson, because she stopped having periods over thirty years ago.   Wouldnt a simple D. N. A.  test prove that fact? the judge asked.   It would if there was a clean sample, but the blood was highly contaminated.  The only other possible source of a quantity of blood that large would have been from Mrs.  Johnsons menses.   That is fucking stupid, the judge said.  Dont waste my time with such drivel.  Now call a witness that can actually help your case or move on so the defense can make a case.   Pissed, the lawyer stomped back to his table and rifled through his notes.  The prosecution calls Franz Rosenthal to the stand.   From the rear of the gallery, a short bald man in a t shirt and shorts stepped through the gate and walked up to the witness stand.  After swearing in, the prosecutor asked him, What do you do for a living Mr.  Rosenthal?  I fix appliances, Rosenthal replied.   Were you in the house the day the body of Mrs.  Estelle Larson was found?  Yes, I was called in to do a repair the day before and scheduled to be there between nine and noon.    When did you show up?  One thirty, Rosenthal replied.  I got busy with a dishwasher.   What did you find when you entered the house?  I found that ape trying to mop up blood from the kitchen floor, Rosenthal replied.   Can you identify this Ape as you put it?  Rosenthal pointed at the defendants table, right at the man that gave Lisa the creeps.  Thats him, right there in the orange jumpsuit.   For the record, let it reflect that Mr.  Rosenthal is pointing to the defendant, Eric Larson.   Eric turned and looked at Lisa and stared at her with a grin on his face.  She didnt know why she was singled out, but the defendant made it very clear he was looking at her.  Then he looked back at the prosecutor and shook his head.   Why did he do that? Lisa whispered to Judd.   I dont know, but it was obvious he was looking at you.   Now I know I know him from somewhere, Lisa said.  That mannerisms, the way he looked, fuck I know it.   It will come to you, just wait.   The prosecutor again addressed Rosenthal.  What happened when the defendant saw you enter the house?  He freaked and tried to beat me with the mop, I took a few good hits and ran the fuck out of there.   Did you ever actually see Mrs.  Larson on the floor?  No, all I saw was the blood and him trying to hit me with a bloody mop, Rosenthal replied.   Thank you, your witness, the prosecutor said to the defense.   The defense lawyer got up and approached Rosenthal at the witness stand.  Is it true that you were tried in this very court for having child pornography on your computer?  Objection! the prosecutor yelled.  What does that have to do with this case?  It shows character your honor the defense lawyer replied.   Ill allow it, the judge stated.   Yeah, I was tried, but I wasnt found guilty of anything.  It was a baseless charge brought on by my bitch ex-wife who wanted to drag me through the mud because I found another woman.   Not guilty is not the same as innocent, the defense stated.   No, but thats what they found, Im clean in the eyes of the law, Rosenthal replied.  Whos on trial here anyway, me or that fuckbag over there in the orange?  Im the one asking the questions, the defense stated.  No further questions.   You may present your next witness, the judge said.   I would like to call Officer John Akimoto to the stand, the prosecutor said.   Again, from the gallery, a man, this time dressed in uniform approached the witness stand and took the oath.  He sat down and waited for the prosecutor to begin.   Officer Akimoto, are you familiar with the case we are tying today? the prosecutor asked.   Yes, I was called to the scene.   Where you the first on at the scene?  Yes.   Please tell us what you observed.   When I arrived at the house, I observed the defendant stuffing a body into a sleeping bag.   Did you identify the body?  Yes, it was the defendant's wife Estelle Larson.   Were you able to identify the cause of death? the prosecutor asked.   There were several kitchen knives spilled onto the floor from a butcher block, at the time I assumed it was from one of them.   What happened when you confronted the defendant?  He stopped what he was doing, I had my weapon drawn on him, and he placed his hands behind his head and got down on his knees, officer Akimoto replied.   Did he try to resist?  No, he laid down and placed his hands behind his back, I cuffed him and waited for backup.   Did the defendant say anything to you at that time?  No, I dont believe so, officer Akimoto replied.   Im done with the witness, the prosecutor stated.   Your witness, the judge said to the defense.   No questions your honor, the defense said.   We will recess until after lunch, Judge said.   Then Lisa saw Eric Larson stand up, still bound in chains and turn to look at her, he mouthed some words she couldnt understand and smiled at her.  She gave him the look that she didnt understand what he said and he got frustrated.  He mouthed the words again and waited for a response, she thought he said, You thought you could. . .  and then, Im back.  She missed the middle and the words made no sense or context.   Are you sure you dont know this guy? Judd asked.   Never seen him in my life, Lisa replied.   Then why did he just say that you thought you could leave him to die, watch out bitch, Im back?       20   Womens prison      Anne spent her first night in prison with a large black woman who seemed way too interested in her.  She was in the same pod, but housed three cells to her left.  At the dinner table, Anne sat alone while this woman and her friends stared at her like a freak at the circus.  Anne knew being new would be hard, and planned on being targeted, but not this fast.  Then the large black woman walked over and sat across the table from her.   I saw you on TV, the woman said.   Anne didnt reply.   My name is Vaniqa, I run this place.   I see, Anne stated looking down at the table.   Look me in the eye, Vaniqa said.  I have some rules for you, you need to listen up, and Im not going to tell them to you again, you understand me?  Anne nodded in agreement.   First, never rat on an inmate, don't be nosy, don't have loose lips, and never put an inmate on the spot.  Second, dont tell the guards anything that could get yourself or another inmate in trouble, and last, youre my bitch, and nobody elses, you got that? I own your ass.   Anne looked at the other women sitting at the table Vaniqa came from, there were three others and she knew she had to comply.   Do you have any questions? Vaniqa asked.   Anne bit her lip and shook her head no.   First things first, I want you in my cell in half an hour.   Why? Anne asked timidly.   I need to initiate you, let you know whos in charge.   What does that mean? Anne asked.   That means you get to pet my bald cat, Vaniqa replied.   Anne closed her eyes and unknowingly shook her head.  She didnt realize she was doing it.   What you shaking your head about girl? Vaniqa asked.  What do you expect? You better get used to pussy, youre going to be eating and fucking it a lot.  If youre good, I might lend you out, but for now, you better practice you tongue techniques.   Vaniqa left the table and joined her fellow inmates.  Anne laid her head down in her arms and closed her eyes, she wanted this nightmare to all go away.       Thirty minutes later, Anne knocked on Vaniqas cell door.  Nobody answered, she knocked again and pushed on the door, it opened and Anne saw a black woman on the floor lying motionless.  She was scared shitless and didnt know what to do, then she felt a hand shove her into the cell and heard the door close behind.  When she turned around it was one of the female guards with another standing behind her.   Whats going on? Anne asked.   Looks like you murdered Vaniqa to me, one of the guards said.   No, I didnt murder anyone, Anne replied.  I just got here.   She was going to rape you, you got pissed and snapped her neck, thats what I saw, the same guard said.   I dont believe this, Ive been here one day and already Ive been threatened, almost raped and now accused of the murder of the woman I was supposed to have sex with, what kind of nut house is this? Anne asked.   Were going to turn you over to the warden, come with us, the guard said.   Anne complied and followed one of the guards out of the cell followed by the other.  They walked along the walkway to the exit door that led to the offices.  Once they reached the wardens office, they knocked and they were buzzed in, Anne stood before the warden awaiting her fate.   Who the fuck is this? the warden asked.  He was a sixty year old something with a suit and tie.   Caught this bitch killing Vaniqa, a guard said with a wink.   Here one day and youre already killing my inmates? the warden asked.   I didnt touch her, Anne replied.   Where did you find her? the warden asked the guard.   She was in Vaniqas cell, Vaniqa was already dead when we got there.   I see, the warden said.  What was your problem with her? he asked.   I had a huge problem with the fact she wanted me to meet her bald cat, but I didn't get that far.  She was dead when I got there.   I think I should call the police and report an inmate on inmate murder.  That should increase your sentence by another forty years.   Go ahead, Im already here for eighty, whats another forty? Anne asked.   Tell you what, Ill make you a deal, the warden said.  I could use another white girl around the office, if you scratch my back, Ill scratch yours.   You want me to pet your bald cat too? Anne asked.   More like my bald snake if you know what I mean, the warden replied.   So let me get this straight, I put out for you, and I dont go down for the framed murder of a woman I had met thirty minutes ago?  Framed? the warden asked.  Thats a harsh accusation.   Whatever, whip it out, lets do this, Anne said frustrated.   I like your spunk, the warden said unbuttoning his pants.  He produced his old wrinkled cock and let it hang.  Come over here, he said and turned in his chair so Anne could get a good angle.  She got down on her knees and took the wardens limp cock in her mouth, for the next ten minutes she worked on it until he blew in her mouth.  She didnt want to swallow his blow so she spit it on the carpet.  You stupid cunt! the warden yelled.  Not on my carpet, you swallow that shit! Do you understand me!  Anne leaned back and wiped her lips.  She looked at the white cum left on her hand and then back at the warden.  I understand, she said.   I want you back here by four, Im going to punish you for that, he said.  Now get me a janitor! he yelled at the guards and they took off leaving Anne behind.  What a bunch of stupid fucks, he said.  They left you alone with me, thats a huge no no.  Dont think about doing anything till they get back.   Are you afraid of me? Anne asked.   Im not a young man anymore, the warden replied.   Yeah, I can see that, your cock is disgusting.  Why is it that everyone that lives here wants to rape me?  Youre new, you have fresh pussy, no STDs or other issues.  You are like gold, probably why Vaniqa was killed.   So you dont think I did it? Anne asked.   Fuck no, but when I knew she was dead, I had me my new white girl, the warden replied.   Youre the warden, you can have whatever you want, are you afraid of your own inmates? Anne asked.   Fuck yes, those ass wipes would kill me in a second if they had a chance.   I bet, Anne said.  So now what?  I want you as my personal inmate assistant, youll do chores for me in the office and whatever else I want during the day.  Im a horny old bastard so get ready to be on your knees a lot.   What if I refuse?  Then I have my guards set you up with the Latinos, they wont be nearly as nice as I am, you should think of me as your protection, as long as youre fucking me, nobody will fuck with you.   Im supposed to feel thankful to you for that? Anne asked.   How else would you feel? Would you rather have a shank in your back? You killed your husband and some queer, youre going to pay for that for the rest of your life.  You will constantly have to be looking over your shoulder.  It would do you well to have me on your side.   Fine, Ill do whatever you want, my life is shit now anyway, Anne said.   Dont be so depressed, youll get used to this life, youll actually get to enjoy it later on.  Just take your time and get used to it.   How many girls have you done this too? Anne asked.  Made your personal assistant?  Six or seven over the years, Ive only been warden here since 89.   Ever knock one up?  Several actually, the warden replied.   What happened to them?  We have our own graveyard north of the fence, I think they are buried there.   You killed them? Anne asked.   No, Id never kill an inmate.   The guards returned with a janitor and were scolded by the warden.  They took Anne back down to the commons area of the pod and let her go.  The warden decided to pin the death of Vaniqa on someone else and let Anne fester for a while getting used to her surroundings.  Once she had some time in prison, shed be more likely to do whatever he asked.       The next morning Anne woke with her cellmate sucking on her tit.  What the fuck are you doing? she yelled.   You werent using it, the woman replied.   Get the fuck off me! Anne shouted and pushed the woman onto the floor.  Who are you anyway?  Jackie, Jackie replied.   When did you get in here? I didnt even know I had a cellmate.   The guards put me in her at three in the morning.  I was busy taking care of some of them if you know what I mean.   No, I dont know what you mean.   I was fucking them dumb ass, letting them in my fuck hole.   Who says Fuck hole? Anne asked.   I don't, get over yourself, bitch,  Why does everyone call everyone else a bitch?  Are we going to have a stupid conversation or are you going to let me back at that tit? Jackie asked.   You were getting laid four hours ago, aren't you sexed out?  Oh no, I can go twenty four seven, I am a sex machine.   Well, I cant, I used to do about six hours a day of it and that was too much.  Im not interested in women anyway.   Like that matters, you have two choices honey, the male guards or the female inmates and its not as easy to get cock here than pussy.   I have a pussy, I dont need yours, Anne snarked back.   Let me tell you something sister, you will learn that your privates arent so private after all.  You will be someones bitch and you will put out when told.  You call it rape, we call it survival.   Thats fine, but I want to go back to bed, so go survive over there on your side of the room, Anne said.   Fine, be that way, you wont be for long.  I can guarantee you that.  Jackie said sliding across the floor to the other side of the room.   Just so you know, Im here because I shot two people, one was my husband, Im not afraid of you or anyone else here.   You dont have a gun to hide behind here missy, and there are more of us than there are of you.  You had the advantage then, we have it now.   Just out of curiosity, what are you in for? Anne asked.   Embezzlement, Jackie replied.  I stole seventy five thousand dollars from the city of Sparksville.   How did you do that?  Do I look stupid to you? Do you think every woman in here is a crack whore, or a child abuser? I have a degree in accounting, I worked in the city offices for twelve years.  I had access to more money than you will ever see.   So how did you get caught if youre so damn smart? Anne asked.   My I got in a fight with my baby daddy and he turned me in.  If it werent for that fucker, Id still be out there free.        21   Eastwood      Judd and Lisa were in Subway when they heard the news on the television on the wall, Eric Larson has escaped from jail transport vehicle and is on the loose, the reporter said with video of the open van and a guard lying on the ground.   Thats like three blocks from here, Judd said looking at the video playback.   We need to go, Lisa said, I have a feeling hes after me.   Where can we go? Were as well off here as anywhere else.   We can hide in the back till they find him, Lisa said.   Both Lisa and Judd got up from the table and walked over to the counter.  There they spoke to one of the sandwich artists, Can we hide in your back room? There is an escaped killer on the loose, Lisa said pointing to the television.   Let me ask my manager, the clerk said and she disappeared behind into the back room.   A few minutes later the manager stepped out.  What can I do for you? he asked.   I want to know if me and my friend can hide in your back room? There is a killer on the loose, about three blocks from here, its on the television.   The manager looked at Lisa like she was nuts.  I dont think thats a good idea, we have food stored back here and I dont want to get turned into the health department for letting people walk around in it.   I said there is a killer three blocks away! Lisa yelled.  And hes coming after me!  Sorry, I cant help you.  But I can get you a refill on your drink if youd like.   I dont need a fucking refill, I need to hide!  Then Judd tapped Lisa on the shoulder and got her attention, he pointed to the front door where Eric Larson stood almost scraping his head on the top of the door.  This man was huge.   Lisa, Eric said low and slow.  Nice to see you again.   Lisa stood there frozen, she didnt have a way to get to the back room, she was blocked off by the sandwich counter and there was no other door in sight.  Who are you? she asked.   Eric stepped into the room and stopped five feet from Lisa and Judd.  You dont recognize me? he said with a laugh.   No, well sort of, you do seem familiar, she replied.   Its me, Toby, he said to her horror.   Toby? she asked.  But you are. . .   Are what? Dead? You left me to die, with that witch, she cut off my tail and killed me.   But how?  She had a spell of rebirth she didnt know was cast in that room, when I died I was reborn into this body.   Why that body? Why did you kill your wife? Lisa asked.   I didnt know she was my wife at the time, when I woke in this body she was swinging a knife at me, I took it and hacked her up, Toby said.   What do you want with me? Lisa asked.   Its your fault this happened to me, because of your greed and total disregard for me, Im now this horrible monster.   Im so sorry, Lisa said.   Sorry? You didnt act sorry when you had the chance to go home and leave me to die.  You could have stayed with me, but no, and you will pay for what you did you selfish piece of shit!  Judd tried to step forward but was too chicken.  He stood still and hoped Toby wouldnt take out his rage on him.  Who are you? Judd asked.   I was her friend, I was her little beaver that tagged along and kept her safe, and then she abandon me to a witch when she had the choice of keeping me alive and staying or killing me and going home.   You blame her for wanting to go home? Judd asked.   I blame her for putting her home before my life, Toby said.   But you were a beaver, not a person!  Now very pissed, Toby stepped forward and grabbed Judd by the collar and pulled him up close to his face.  Toby had very bad breath and a grip like a weight lifter.  I dont give a fuck if I were a person or not, my life is as important as anyone elses, do you agree? Toby asked.   Judd cowered down and said, Yes.   Toby then grabbed Lisa and tore her clothes off in front of all the customers, nobody tried to help her.  I liked you naked before, I like you naked now, Toby said.  Lisa stood naked covering her privates with her arms.  Didnt bother you before, now why cover up? Toby said with a grin.  He took her by the arm and pulled her towards the door.  Before he got all the way, he looked back at Judd and said, Are you going to stop me? and laughed.  Toby was not the same Toby he was before, he was mean, and vengeful.   Judd stood back like a chickenshit watching the girl he was falling for being pulled out of Subway nude.  Did anyone call 911? he shouted.   I did, a voice came from the table by the window.   Does anyone have a gun? Judd asked.  Three hands raised, one with a pistol.  Judd took the gun and walked out the door looking for Lisa and Toby, they were fifty feet away walking down the street.  Where they were going was anyones guess.  Judd looked at the gun, it was a revolver, and he didnt know how to shoot it so he pointed it up in the air and pulled the trigger to see what would happen.  Bam he heard and an echo popped back from the building across the street, it worked fine and was easy to use.   Now that Judd knew how to use the gun, he took off running towards Toby and Lisa.  It took less than a minute to catch up.  He was winded but managed to yell at Toby, Stop, I got a gun!  Toby turned to face Judd, What part of spell of rebirth dont you understand? Toby asked.   Actually, none of it, Judd replied.   Ill explain it nice and easy for you, you cant kill me, not with that, Toby said.   Then how?  Fuck you, now leave me and my girl alone, Toby said and walked away.   Judd stepped in close and aimed the pistol at Tobys head, he popped off a shot and watched a chunk of Tobys forehead rip open and some brains and blood fly out.  Toby turned and looked back at Judd pressing his skull back in place.  Do that again and see what I do to you, Toby said in a Clint Eastwood voice.   Judd then popped off the rest of the cylinder into Tobys face and ran, he didnt figure Toby would let go of Lisa, so running was a viable option.  Toby pressed his face back together and wiped the blood on his pants.   Where are you taking me? Lisa asked, now splattered with blood and brains.   Up there, he replied looking up to a tall building.   Why there?  Dont know, just like the way it looks I guess, Toby replied pulling on Lisa.   What happened to you? You werent like this before?  That was before you abandon me and left me to die, Toby replied.   What did you expect? That Id stay there? That wasnt my home, I might as well have been dead, she pleaded.   Maybe so, but fate made it that I got my tail cut off and then chopped into little pieces while you ran back to momma.  Wheres momma now? Toby asked.   Prison, Lisa replied.   See, you had nothing to come home to all along, you could have stayed with me.   How was I supposed to know my mother was going to shoot my dad?  I knew it, Toby said.   What? How?  When you are killed by a witch, it does things to you, I see things, I was there.   What do you mean you were there?  I put the idea in your mothers head to shoot the prostitute and your dad, she followed my instructions like a sheep.   Why? Lisa asked.   To punish you, I would do anything to get back for what you did to me, your mother was first, now you.   Toby now was at the front entrance of the building pushing his way inside.  He looked around for an elevator and pressed the up key.  The lobby was empty as this seemed to be an apartment building or dormitory.  Once inside, they rose to the top and got out.  We need a room, Toby said.   These rooms are probably occupied, Lisa replied.   Do you think I care? Toby said.  Ive been to hell, nothing compares anymore.  Toby picked a room at random and knocked on the door, in a few seconds and elderly woman opened the door.   Hello, can I help you? she asked.   Toby grabbed her by her grey hair and flung her against the wall behind him with a thud.  She lay there moaning as Toby entered her apartment pulling Lisa in with him.  He turned, locked the door and pushed Lisa onto the couch.  He threw the remote at her and said, Watch some old lady shows, youre going to be here awhile.   Not if she gets the cops, Lisa said.   Toby scratched his chin and thought for a second.  He unlocked the front door and walked over to the old lady and kicked her till she was unconscious.  He returned to the apartment and said, Thanks, I almost forgot about her.   Oh shit, you didnt kill her did you? Lisa asked.   Maybe, and I wouldnt have tried if you hadnt said something, shes probably dead because of you, got that? You.  You might as well of done it yourself, Toby snapped back.   Feeling horribly guilty, Lisa began to cry.  The tears mixed with the blood splatter and ran down onto the plastic covered couch.   You need a shower, Toby said.  Go find it and wash up.   You need to fuck off and die! Lisa yelled.   Yeah, I know, but thats not going to happen, thanks you I cant die.  Look at my face, its all fucked up from that asshole and his gun.   Id take a sledgehammer to your fucking ugly face if I had one, Lisa said.   What happened to you? We had some good times, we were buddies, and now you leave me to die and then treat me like Im the bad guy? Youre a piece of shit lady.   Im sorry, I shouldnt have left you with the witch, I was wrong, but its too late now and I cant take it back.   Toby looked in the womans refrigerator for food or something to drink.  All she has is prune juice, butter and eggs.  How does she live on this shit?  Why do you care? Its not like you can starve or anything.   Touch Toby said, But I could use a beer right now.  Toby walked over to Lisa and looked down at her nude body.  She was still hot.  What do you say we take that shower together? My dick is a lot bigger now that Im human.   Never, Lisa said.   Never say never, Toby replied.  Get up.   Lisa sat motionless.   Toby grabbed her by the arm and pulled her to her feet.  Dont fuck with me, when I say get up, you get up, hear me?  Lisa stared into Tobys shot up face and then looked away.  You can do to me what you want, but I wont make it easy for you.   Toby pushed Lisa towards the only closed door in the room.  Open it, he said.   Lisa opened the door revealing a bathroom.  The shower was easy to see and Toby began to smile.  Get the water running and rinse off, Ill be in, in a minute.   Lisa stepped into the bathroom and turned on the water.  She waited till it warmed up and stepped into the tub pulling the surround in place.  The water felt good as the blood and brains were washed from her body.  Then she heard the shower curtain pull open and saw out of the corner of her eye Toby step in nude behind her.  He reached around and put his arms around her and grabbed a breast with each hand.  She felt his erection poke her from behind and knew what she was in for.  The dirty little rat she knew from her travels in Lancaster was now going to fuck the shit out of her in the shower.  She felt she deserved it though, she did leave him to die.        22   Elena      Toby got out of the shower after fucking Lisa, he didnt consider it rape, and he knew she had it coming.  After toweling off, he opened the door and stepped into the living room naked.  Sitting on the couch was the old woman he thought he had killed smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer.  What the fuck? Toby asked.   Nice cock, the old woman said looking between Tobys legs.   Thanks, Toby replied.  What are you doing here? he asked.   The old woman took a drag off her cigarette and replied, I live here asshole, and the question is, what are you doing here?  I needed a place to hang for a while, the cops are after me.   Saw that on the news, youre real popular right now.  Whos the girl?  Lisa, my new ex-girlfriend, Toby replied.   According to the news you kidnapped her from the Subway across the street, she said.   Thats their opinion, Toby said.   Whats up with your face?  Got shot up, pretty bad, Toby replied.   Why arent you dead?  Im not going to explain myself you to right now, my question is why you arent dead? I kicked the shit out of you in the hall.   Probably for the same reason youre still alive, do you know who I am? she asked.   No, should I?  The woman smiled and crossed her legs the other way.  Im what you would call the Wicked Witch of the East, or West, whatever the fuck its supposed to be.  My name is Elena.   Another fucking witch? Ive never met one in my life until three months ago and now Ive met two, what are the odds? Toby asked.   Your odds probably increased because you met on before, once you are around a witch, you become drawn to the power we share.  You probably didnt realize why you picked this apartment out of a hundred.  Why the top floor? There is no escape if you got caught by the police, this is the worst place you could have picked to hide out.  Youre here because Im here, Elena said.   Toby crossed his arms, he realized she was probably right.  Ok, so now what? You going to change me back into a beaver?  A beaver? Elena asked with a giggle, then she put two and two together.  You used to be a talking beaver? she asked more seriously.   Yes, Toby replied.   What did this other witch do to you?  She chopped off my tail for some fucked up spell and then killed me for stew, Toby said.   Elena got a serious look on her face.  Who is this witch that cut off your tail?  Madame Jane is her name, Toby replied.   Never heard of her, where does she live?  Lancaster.   Ive heard of Lancaster, never been there, Elena said.  What did she say she wanted with your tail?  She said she could cast a spell for unlimited power, Toby replied.   If thats the case, why isnt she in power now?  Maybe she is and you dont know it, Toby said.   True, her power may only be where she is, in Lancaster, she may have no power here at all.   All I know is that I changed into this and I cant die, now that I think about it, Im not sure I like that idea so much.   Did she cast a spell on you?  Not that I remember, one minute shes stabbing me with a knife, the next Im in this body with a dead woman on the floor.   So you didnt kill your wife?  My wife? Ive never been married.  I had a girlfriend once, but the bitch cheated on me, I did kill her and her boyfriend, but thats not against the law if you're a beaver.   Interesting, Elena said rubbing out her smoke in an ashtray.   Enough back story, now what am I going to do? Toby asked.  According to you I was drawn here by your power, so do something.   Honestly, I dont need the two of you living in my apartment, I dont have enough food to feed myself let alone three.  Your best bet is to leave here and go back to Lancaster and undo what Madame Jane did in the first place.   Easy for you to say, I have no idea how to get back there, and there is no fucking way I can make her do anything for me.  The last I knew, she had me for supper.   Elena shook her head and lit up another cigarette.  Youre shit out of luck my friend, this place is closed, you dont have to go home, but you cant stay here.   What is this? A bar? Toby asked.   I worked in bars all my life, Elena said.  Dont knock it.   I didnt, Toby said.   Then a voice from behind Toby, it was Lisa standing in the bathroom doorjamb.  Whats going on? she asked.   Toby turned and looked at Lisa, she was wearing a towel.  Get that thing off, he said and she let it drop to the floor.  Seems we have a landlord now.   What do you mean? Lisa asked.   Elena here decided not to die, shes a witch and wants us to leave her apartment.   Lisa looked at the old lady sitting, and smoking.  Im sorry, I have no. . .   Dont worry honey, I dont blame you for what this asshole did, Elena said.   Toby was now pissed.  I think well be staying for a while, he said.  Do you have a phone?  Elena pointed to the kitchen counter.  Toby stepped over, still naked, grabbed the land line and tore it from the wall.  Cell phone? he asked.   I cant afford groceries, do you think I can afford a cell?  Toby walked back into the living room.  Now, lets get a few things straight, as long as Im in this apartment, I rule, me and Lisa will be sleeping in your bedroom, you get the couch.  If you dont like the couch, you can sleep on the floor.  Got me? Toby asked Elena.   Elena shook her head as if to say no.  Then she snapped her fingers and Toby fell to the floor holding his hands over his nuts writhing in pain.   What did you do? Lisa asked.   Gave him a nut punch, bastard, Elena replied.   You can do that? Wow, Lisa replied.   I may be old, but I have a lot of tricks.  Ill have this fucker begging me to kiss my old lady ass pretty soon.   Lisa stood over Toby and looked down on him.  You cant tell me what to do anymore, she said with a smile.  Im going to the police and turn your ass in, and then Im going to get dressed, you cant make me run around naked anymore for your own personal viewing pleasure.   Toby reached out and grabbed Lisas leg and pulled her off balance dropping her to the floor.  He then put his hands around her neck and began to squeeze.   Stop him! Lisa choked out to Elena.   Im trying! she said but nothing.  It was as if Toby was now immune to Elenas witchcraft, or at least he was now able to tolerate the pain.   Toby let up on Lisa and stopped choking her.  He crawled on top of her and put one hand around her neck pushing her to the floor.  That wont happen again, Toby said.  I wasnt expecting that, but now that I know what she can do, I can block her.  Somehow I gained some power when I was transformed from a beaver to a man.  Im not as weak as you think I am, Toby said.   Get off her, Elena said.   Toby rolled off Lisa and sat facing Elena.  Got anymore tricks? he asked.   I got a gun but from the looks of your face that wont do much good, Elena replied.   Toby pushed on the wounds on his face, I think theyre healing, he said.  Wont be long till Im pretty again, he laughed.  How old are you? Toby asked Elena.   Seventy nine, and you?  This body? No fucking clue, my old body, five, Toby replied.   You have a lot of anger for a five year old, Elena said.   Thats beaver years, Im probably thirty in human years, Toby replied.   What do you plan to do with the girl? You cant keep her locked up in here forever.   Toby looked at Lisa lying on the floor nude.  Why not? What do I have to lose?      Two hours later and Toby is starving.  You have any cash? he asked Elena knowing the answer.   No, I live on public assistance, my check doesnt go far, she replied.   We have to get some food, Toby said.  But I cant leave you two behind.   You cant watch us both, Elena said.  One of us will get away.   Ill think of something, Toby said.  What about the neighbors?  Leave them alone, Elena said.  Youve caused enough trouble, these are nice peaceful people up here, most like me, elderly on fixed incomes.   Im not going to roll over and starve, I have to eat, and so do you, so either help me or shut the fuck up.   There is one person who might be able to help, Elena said.  He lives at the end of the hall, he has money.   Can you get it from him? Toby asked.   Maybe, hes always trying to get in my panties, if I play along, he might help me.   How soon can you try? Toby asked.   Are you going to go down there with me? That might be awkward, Elena said.   Toby knew she was right, as soon as she left the door she could run straight to the police.  Why didnt you run to the police instead of coming in here after I kicked the shit out of you?  I wanted to handle it myself, Ive never had a good experience with the police.  Lazy fuckers, Elena replied.   No, theres something else, some reason why you didnt want the police sniffing around here, what is it? You growing pot or something?  No, there is no pot in this apartment.   You selling drugs? Running a prostitution ring?  Nope, Elena replied.   Then what is it? Why didnt you call the cops?  Elena was silent, Toby knew he was onto something.  What is your secret? Toby asked.  Ill tear this fucking place apart if you dont tell me! he barked.   Elena sat quiet and looked away.   Toby stood up and walked over to a display case that ran the length of the wall to the bathroom door.  He looked at Elena trying to judge her reaction as he moved around the room.  He pulled open one of the glass doors and pulled out a porcelain figurine of a dancing girl.  He looked at it and back at Elena.  What are you hiding? he asked.   I got that from Austria, on a trip, do you like it? she asked.   Love it, Toby replied.  He grabbed a different figurine, this one of a knight riding a white horse.  This one is awesome, he said.  How much are these worth? he asked.   I paid maybe ten dollars for each fifty years ago, I dont know what they are worth now.  What are you going to do? Break them unless I answer your question?  Fuck no, these are incredible, Id never break these, Toby replied.   Then please be careful with them, they mean a lot to me,  I bet, Toby replied.  If you dont tell me your little secret, maybe I could sell them.   Sell them how? You keep forgetting you cant leave either of us alone, if you walk out that door, you're fucked.   No, I just need to find a way to keep you two from leaving while Im gone, Toby said.        23   Checkers      Six a. m.  the guard opened Annes cell pod door and said, Inmate Anne Marie, youre on work release today, get up and get showered.  The guard closed the door and left Anne laying there groggy.   What work release? she asked out loud, her cellmate was asleep and didnt answer.  She got up and walked to the shower where three other female inmates were already lathered up and making out.  Fuck, isnt six in the morning girls, cant you do that later?  Shut the fuck up, one of them said.  Well do whatever the fuck we want.   Anne found the shower farthest from the three women and turned on the water, she yelled over to the other three women, What do you know about a work release today?  Its your turn to clean the wardens house, if you know what I mean, one replied.   Are you kidding me? Doesnt this guy have a job? Anne yelled back.   He calls it a meeting.  If he likes your, hell have you over cleaning his house three times a week.   Isnt sucking his dick in his office good enough?  No, he was testing you out, to see if you were any good, if you were smart, youd of bit that fucker right on the cock.   Thanks for telling me now, Anne said.  How long does this usually take?  He likes it slow and low, youll be there for three hours at least.  He likes to do all kinds of sick shit.   I bet, he seems the type, taking advantage of inmates for his own pleasure.   Dont knock it sister, once you become his bitch, you get anything you want around here, fuck, you could get a private cell and all the contraband you want, just make sure when you leave, you leave him happy.   Anne suds up and washed up.  She was tired but the shower was waking her.  Now she had a full day of fucking an old man to look forward too, at least it was better than sitting in the pod all day staring at the same magazines all day and getting hit on by the other inmates.       Two hours later, Anne is escorted to the wardens home.  Its a huge mansion with a pool and three stall garage.  One of the guards grabbed a bag from the seat behind her and tossed it to Anne, Put this on, he likes his girls dressed up.   Anne pulled the contents of the bag and saw what she expected, the basic uniform of every hooker she ever seen.  You want me to change now? she asked.   Yes, and hurry up, I dont have all day, the guard said.   Anne stripped in the back of the van and put on what was in the bag.  A pair of lacy thong panties, a skirt that didnt cover her coochie and a bra that was frilly and see through.  Over the top was a short top that let the underside of her tits show.  Finally was a pair of six inch black heels.  She put them on and stepped out of the van pulling and tugging everything into place.  The guard walked her to the front door and rang the doorbell.  A maid answered the door and let them in.  The warden will be with you in a moment, she said and left them in the huge front room.   Then the warden walked in wearing only a robe.  I like, he said and walked over to Anne, he placed his hands firmly on both of her breasts and squeezed.  Damn, those are nice, he said and looked Anne in the eye for a reaction, he got none, Anne was used to getting laid three times an hour back when she worked at the diner.  I hope you like it in the ass, he said motioning her to lie on the couch.   Its ok, Anne said.   I have several kinds of anal lube, are you allergic to any kind? he asked.   Dont remind me, just pick one and get it over, Anne replied.   Oh, thats for last, I have lots of fun things for us to do before then.   Like what? Play checkers? Anne said with a grin.   No, now let me see your pussy, the warden said.   Anne lifted what little of a skirt she had and showed the warden her thong.   Pull it to one side, he said.   Anne tugged the thong to the right exposing her slit.   Finger it, the warden said.   Anne dug her finger inside and rolled it around watching the warden get off on her.   Very nice, now sit on the couch and spread your legs wide.   Can I take off the shoes?  No! Never, you keep those on till Im done with you, now do as I say.   Anne sat on the couch and spread her legs wide.  The warden got down on his knees and looked at her thong almost shaking.  He reached over and pulled it to one side and spread her lips apart with his other hand.   Hold it open, I want to take pictures, he said.  He reached over to the end table and grabbed his phone.  Spread it wide, he said and took several close up pictures of her open pussy.  Very nice, he said.  Play with it, I want pictures of that too.   Anne complied and fingered her pussy while the warden took pictures.   Deeper, he said and she dug in.   Taste it, he said and she put her finger in her mouth.   How does it taste? he asked.   Taste it yourself, she said.   Oh no, Im not allowed, my wife would kill me, the warden replied.   What?  Im not allowed to touch, she has rules.   You already did, are you telling me your wife knows you do this?  Yes, but as long as I dont touch its alright.  Dont say anything.   But you made me give you a blow job in your office.   Shhh! dont say that out loud, if she found out Id be dead for sure.   Where is your wife? Anne asked.   Outside on the porch.   Why isnt she inside?  She doesnt like to watch me, she thinks its sick, the warden replied.   How is it that she lets you watch inmates bang themselves in the first place? Anne asked.   She feels guilty, she cant have sex anymore so she lets me do this,  She cant give you a hand job? Anne asked.   Well, she could, but shed find that beneath her.  She doesnt like touching me down there.  She says Im gross.   So why cant you fuck?  Then a voice from the sliding door, Because hes mine you stupid cunt, the warden's wife replied.   I dont get it, then why let him watch me fuck myself?  Youre no different than a porn site to me, only he insists he sees real girls, but crossing the line into sex is not going to happen.   You are denying him, why not let him fuck someone else? Are you afraid hell leave you? Anne asked.   Hes tried several times, hence the rules.  Hes lucky he gets what he gets at all after the stunts hes pulled.  Has he had you suck him off in his office yet? the warden's wife asked.   Anne hesitated.   I knew it, fucker, Im going to cut his balls off some day.   Anne looked at the warden who was acting like a beat down puppy.  Why do you put up with her? she asked.   Id be lost without her, the warden replied.   I think your lost anyway, do yourself a favor and stick your cock in me now.  Show this bitch youre a man.   Do it and you die! the wardens wife yelled.   The warden was at a loss, he had no idea what to do, stand up to his wife and run the chance of losing everything, or buckle under her pressure and sulk away.   Anne rubbed the warden with her heel to get his attention.  Im wet, and I know youre hard by now, do it, stick it in me.  Blow your wad inside me now!  Do it and Ill get a gun! the wardens wife yelled.   The warden, pissed but now determined, took off his robe and mounted Anne on the couch.  He plunged his rock hard cock into her and pumped three times before unloading his blow inside her.  It was like a dam bursting and Anne took it all.   In the background, the clip clop sound of the wardens wifes shoes could be heard on the hardwood floor, she was getting her gun.   Get off me, Anne said pushing the warden off of her.  She stood up, kicked off her heels and ran to the door where the guards were standing.  Dont just stand there! Shes getting a gun, Move!  The guards now realized that the shit was hitting the fan and that their lives were in danger.  They opened the door and let Anne out and quickly followed running to the van.  Anne took off to the hills and ran up an embankment disappearing into the woods.   Anne heard gunshots and knew the warden was blown to bits, but her main concern now was finding a way through the woods to somewhere safe.  She never denied that she killed her husband and the male prostitute, but she felt that this punishment went way beyond what she expected and wasnt going to run back to the guards just to be hauled back to that corrupt prison.  Now she was on her own and had to get to the one person she knew she could kind of count on, her daughter Lisa.       Later that night Anne found a place to stop and sleep for the night.  It was cold but she knew it was better than turning herself in.  Then she heard a voice call out, Are you cold?  Scared shitless, Anne sat up and looked around in the dark.  She couldnt see anyone, was it a guard? Who said that? she asked.   Down here, the voice said.   Anne looked down at the ground and saw nothing but twigs and leaves.  And a toad.  I dont see anyone.   The toad spoke up, Im right here, what are you? Blind?  Anne leaned in closer, she was near sighted, Yeah, now I see you, am I dead? Anne asked.   No, now answer the question, are you cold?  Im freezing my tits off, Anne replied crossing her arms tight shivering.   I can get you a blanket if you want, the toad said.   I need a large one, Anne said.   No shit, now do you want the blanket or not?  Sure, do I have to fuck you for it too? Anne asked pissed.   No, the toad said shaking its head in disgust.  All you have to do is answer a question, you get it right, you get a blanket, you get it wrong, I get to infect you with toad herpes.   I dont want toad herpes, I wont take that chance, Anne replied.   It will get down to forty degrees here in an hour, Ill wait, the toad said.   Whats the question? Anne asked.   You dont get to hear the question unless you agree to answer it, you cant back out half way.  Failure to answer results in toad herpes.  the toad said.   Anne rubbed her shoulders with her hands, she was cold as fuck.  Whats the question? she asked.   What did Obi Wan Kenobi say to the storm troopers when they asked about the droids in Lukes speeder? the frog asked.   What? Anne asked.   You heard me.   Thats not a real question, ask me something real.   That is something real, that was an easy one.   What is an Obi Wan?  You never saw Star Wars? the frog asked.   How did you? You live in the woods?  This isnt about me, now you answer the question or I start up with the toad herpes.   Let me think,  If you have to think, you dont know, lets get this over with now.        24   Invisible      Toby opened more cabinet doors looking for whatever Elena was hiding.  He didnt know for sure if it was a real object or not, but something kept her from running to the police when she had the chance.  Then he found something, not in the drawers, but on the wall.  Up on a shelf, sitting over the loveseat, was a small foot wide standalone shelf with a decorated box in the middle.   Elena noticed that Tony saw the box and her demeanor changed.   Whats that? Tony asked.   A decorated box, Elena replied.   Whats in it?  Elena didnt reply.   Tony walked over and took the box from the shelf, it was light, he saw it had a lid and opened it.  Whats this? he asked.   What does it look like?  Looks like a dead dried up baby, what the fuck?  I bought that at a freak show, I dont know what it is, I liked the box it came in, Elena said.   Why keep the dried up kid? Is this what youve been hiding all this time? I assume its not legal to keep dead babies in your apartment.   Let me see it, Lisa said holding out her hand.   Toby handed the box to Lisa who took a look at it.  How old was it when it died? she asked.   Elena answered, Eighteen months.   You sound pretty sure of yourself, do you know for sure?  Elena hung her head and said, Yes, he was my son.   Holy fuck, Toby said.  Thats pretty fucked up lady, Toby said.  Why are you keeping your dead kid in a box in your living room?  I get my power from him, without him I am nothing.   So that explains that, if the cops found out you had a dead baby in a box on your shelf, you might have some explaining to do.   Yeah, I might, Elena said.   Lisa spoke up, How did he die? she asked.   Im not going to discuss that with you or anyone, its been over sixty years, I dont need to have that dredged up now, Elena replied.   Toby stood thinking.  Now that I know why Im here, I got to leave, this place is more like a jail cell then any real cell they would put me in.  What if I take Lisa and the kid, you stay here.   What are you going to do with my son? Elena asked.   You said it gives you power, maybe I can use that, Toby said.   Youre going to take my son based on a maybe?  I cant live here forever, and I cant take you both with me, this kid may be my key to making it.  Im sure you wont call the cops if I take it, it will lead back to you.   Without my son Im nothing, if you take him, I will call the cops, Elena said.   Ill take that chance, Toby said grabbing the box from Lisa.  Lets go, he said and headed to the door.   She still has no clothes on, how do you expect to get anywhere? Elena asked.   Why do you care? Toby asked back.   I dont, leave me alone, Elena replied sadly.   Toby looked back at Lisa, she was slow moving.  Get your ass moving! Toby snapped.   Lisa headed to the door and followed Toby down the hall to the elevator leaving Elena behind.       Once they reached the lobby, they both got out, Toby with the box in hand and Lisa still nude.  Nobody seemed to notice or care.  They left the building and stood on the sidewalk looking for a way to travel, they had little money and no sense of where to go.   Youre so fucking stupid, Lisa said.  Where to you plan to go?  Back to the river, Toby said.  Back home, I know that area.   Do you know how to get there? Lisa asked.   I know the general location, if I can get a ride to the river, I can follow it down to my dam.   In case you havent noticed, youre not a beaver anymore.  You wont fit.   I know Im not a beaver anymore, but I can build a larger dam, Toby snapped back.   You want to kidnap me and force me to live naked in a beaver dam built for two? Lisa asked.  There is no way we can survive like that.   Problem with you is you lived too long in the city.  You never tried good country living.   And I really dont want to start now.  It gets cold and I need clothes, Lisa said.   Ive never worn clothes till I woke up from a bad dream in that house, honestly, I hate this and cant wait to get back to nature.   Youre not a beaver anymore, you dont have fur, youll freeze in the winter, Lisa replied.   Not wanting to hear her logic, Toby replied, Lets get walking, river cant be more than ten miles away.   Together, they two walked down the sidewalk like a couple.  A couple of freaks that is.  Lisa expected to be stopped by the cops at any time for public indecency, but it was like she was invisible.   Ten miles is a long fucking way, Lisa said, her tits rocking back and forth with each step.  And why doesnt anyone ever notice Im not wearing any clothes?  I think they do, they just dont want to make a scene or get involved, Toby replied.   Block after block they walked heading towards the edge of town towards the country where the river crossed.   When we get to the river, what is your plan? Lisa asked.  You expect me to swim till we get to your beaver dam?  The river isnt that deep, maybe four feet in a few places, you could wade through, or walk along the bank, and I dont care.   Lets try to get a ride, Lisa said.  I keep stepping on shit with my bare feet and they hurt like hell.   Fine with me, Toby said.  You flag someone down.   Lisa stopped in her tracks and stood looking at traffic as it went by, she put out her thumb hoping people still knew what that meant.  Almost immediately a car pulled to the curb and stopped.  In the drivers seat was a forty something year old woman in sunglasses.  You need a ride? she asked.   Yeah, me and my friend here need a ride to the river, Lisa replied.   Why are you naked? the woman asked.   My friend likes me that way I guess, Lisa replied.   What size are you? the woman asked.   Five, Lisa replied.   What size bra?  32 B, Lisa replied.  Why?  I got some clothes you can have, but my tits are way bigger than yours.  the woman said pulling up her shirt.   Toby leaned in, Can we get a ride or not? he asked rudely.   Yeah, you get in back, she can ride up front with me, the woman replied.   Toby got in the back, still holding his box and Lisa got in the front seat.  The woman put her hand on Lisas thigh and drove the car back onto the street.  Lisa thought it was odd that this woman would be touching her like that, but didn't want to rock the boat and give up a free ride.  Then the womans hand started inching its way towards Lisas crotch.  Still Lisa didnt do anything.   Are you guys going swimming? the woman asked.  She was now rubbing Lisa between the legs.   Yeah, Toby replied.  Were going to spend the day swimming.   Sounds like fun, I might get in and join you if you dont mind.   We plan to head on down a few miles, not sure you want to go that far.   Oh, you dont know how far I want to go, the woman said spreading Lisas legs apart.  She dug in deep and put two fingers inside Lisa who looked out the window like nothing was going on.   Toby opened the box and looked around to see if there was anything else he had missed.  Mixed in with the bones was a card, he pulled it out and read it.  It was a business card from way long ago, some sort of salesman selling brushes or some damn thing.  There was nothing else in the box but bones and dust.  Then he saw something scribbled on the inside of the lid.  It read, Thomas Xavier Roberts, 1941.   I found a name and a birthdate on the lid, Toby said.   By now Lisa was starting to grind with the rubbing she was getting from the driver.  She wasnt paying attention to Toby and ready to blow.   Did you hear me? he asked.   The driver spoke up, She cant hear you, and shes going to cum any second.   Toby looked over the seat and saw what was going on.  Wow, why didnt you tell me you were doing that? he asked.  You do that for me next? he asked.   I only do women, sorry, she replied.   Figures, Toby said.  How much further to the river?  About two miles, she replied.   Lisa exploded and came hard leaving the drivers fingers clenched in her tight wet pussy.  You going to return the favor? the driver asked.   Lisa calmed down and replied, I dont do chicks.   Really? the driver replied.  Then why did you let me finger you?  I didnt want to walk and as long as you were getting off, I got a free ride, Lisa replied.   The woman looked over her shoulder at Toby, Im so fucking horny right now Id let you eat me out, she said.   Toby looked at her and then realized he really didnt think human females were that attractive.  Maybe if she were a beaver.  No thanks, Ill take care of myself later.   What man turns down the chance to eat a woman out? she asked.   Im gay, how does that sound? Toby asked back.   I believe that, what man would be walking around with a naked woman instead of fucking her? she asked with a giggle.   Thats right, Im her gay friend, I keep other men from trying to fuck her when she walks around naked.   Why do you do that? the woman asked.  You said he likes you that way, but are you a nudist or something?  I am now, Lisa replied shaking her head.   What do you mean? Is he making you do this?  Yes,  I dont get it, the woman said.   Toby spoke up, Dont listen to her, she is a nudist, just like you thought.   No, hes kidnapped me and is taking me to his beaver dam to be his naked slave girl, Lisa replied.   Toby spoke up again, Beaver dam? That is absurd.  Dont listen to her bullshit, she just likes to be naked.   The car pulled up to the bridge and stopped.  Here we are, the woman said.  I dont suppose Im getting anything out of this so have a nice trip, she said.   Lisa spoke up, You got to finger me for ten minutes, thats something.   The woman put her fingers in her mouth and tasted Lisas pussy juice.  Wanna do it again? she asked.   I didnt want you to do it in the first place, although you did a great job, Lisa replied.   What? Are you afraid you might like another woman?  I like cock, plain and simple.  If I wanted pussy, I could taste my own.   With that said, both Toby and Lisa got out of the car and watched the woman drive off leaving them behind.  The river was brown and moving along at a slow pace reflecting the sun from above.   Im getting in, Toby said, You can either get in or walk along the side.        25   Stitches      The next day Anne walked through the woods looking for a place to stay, like an abandoned farm house, she came across a river and realized she was cut off from the city, unless she tried to swim across.  Then she saw a man wading waist deep in the water heading downstream.  Then she heard a familiar voice call out to her, Mom! It was Lisa, who was walking along the bank on the same side she was.   Anne ran over to her daughter and noticed right away she was naked.  Wheres your clothes? she asked.   Its a long story mom, how did you escape from prison? Lisa asked.   I was taken to the wardens house to give him a private sex show and escaped.  Theyre probably in the woods looking for me right now.  Whos that guy in the river? Anne asked.   Lisa looked at Toby who was now making his way over.  His name is Toby, Lisa replied.   Friend of yours?  Not really, hes kind of kidnapped me as well.   Whats up with us getting captured by men? Anne laughed.  Why didnt you run? Hes in the river, you could have got away.   He is a very good swimmer, hard to explain, but if I were to have run, he would have got me very quickly.   Toby got out of the water and stepped up onto the bank.  He was fully dressed and his clothes dripped onto the sand as he walked.  Who are you talking too? he asked.   Its my mom! Lisa replied.   No way, whats the odds? What are you doing out here? Fishing? Toby asked.   No, I just escaped from prison, she replied.   Just you? Anyone else with you? Toby asked.   No, just me.   Lisa spoke up, Isnt that great? Mom can come with us!  Less than enthused, Toby replied, Yeah, I guess.   Whats wrong? Lisa asked.   I dont have a lot of room, as you like to point out, three will be hard to house.   Where do you live? Anne asked.   You tell her, Toby said to Lisa.   Lisa tried to think of a way to explain this to her mother.  Toby lives in a beaver dam.   Alright, Anne said.  Is that the name of a hotel?  No, a real beaver dam, see he used to be a beaver, but he and I were sucked into a watery wormhole and transported to a town called Lancaster, where we met a woman who was a witch who killed him because he was a talking beaver which gave her special powers.  Then his soul was transported back to Sparksville where he was reborn into the body of a man who had just killed his wife.  He found me at a Subway restaurant and kidnapped me, brought me here and there you go.   Thats quite the tall tale, Anne said with a grin.  Now tell me the truth, is this your new boyfriend?  Toby stepped in close and pushed Anne back.  You listen cunt, shes telling the truth, that isnt some tall tale  Taken aback by Tobys rudeness, Anne replied, You expect me to believe you used to be a beaver? A talking beaver? Then Anne remembered that she had spoken to a toad the night before.   Yeah, furry and cute, just like you pussy, he replied with a grin.   Whats up with you men and sex? Is that all you think about?  I think your gross bitch, I wouldnt fuck your hairy cunt with my dick or anyone elses.  Dont flatter yourself, Toby replied.  Now Im stuck with you so dont piss me off.   Stuck? Im a grown woman, I can do whatever I fucking want, Anne replied.   Dont listen to him mom, youre coming with us, Lisa said.   From what I hear, I dont think Im welcome, Anne said.   She has nowhere to go, you have to let her come with us, you cant let her go back to prison, Lisa begged Toby.   Toby shook his head and said, Another mouth to feed, great.   So its ok? Lisa asked.   For now, Toby replied.   How far is it to your dam? Anne asked.   Im guessing six or seven miles, Toby replied.  You will go faster if you get in the river with me.       Two hours later, the three of them found Tobys beaver dam and gathered round looking at it.  I dont remember it being so small, Toby said.  He set his magic box down on the ground.   There is no way three of us are living here, Anne said.   Good, then get the fuck out, Toby said.   Toby! Lisa yelled back, Thats my mother, show her some respect!  She isnt my mother, I didnt ask for someone else to take care of, Toby said.   Anne, feeling left out, spoke up, Ill make myself useful, Ill go look for something we can eat.   You want some help? Lisa asked.   Yeah, Anne said.   Toby spoke up, No fucking way, if you leave, you will take off, Lisa stays with me, and you can go by yourself.   Wait, lets all go together once we figure out how were going to make this dam livable, Lisa said.   Toby reached in and pulled on some of the branches trying to look inside the dam.  This will take a week just to tear apart and two weeks to rebuild  So what do you want to do? Lisa asked.   First thing, we need to find fresh water to drink, Toby said.   What about the river water? Lisa asked.   If I were a cow or a deer, yeah, but I want something that dont look like someone took a shit in, Toby said.   What did you drink when you were a beaver? Anne asked.   River water, but thats all I knew, I used to piss in that water, Toby replied.   Where do we find clean drinking water? Anne asked.   We need to find a farm house with a well, Toby replied.   Wont the farmer be a bit pissed that three strangers are drinking from his well?  We find some containers, fill them up at night, nobody will find out.   Lisa spoke up, Do you know of any farms around here?  No, I spent all my time in the river, beavers dont get around on land much.  We need to quit talking and get to looking, we cant last long without drinking water, Toby said motioning for the other two to follow him.   I hope you know what youre doing, Anne said.   Shut the fuck up and follow me, Toby said walking back into the woods.  You cant throw a dead chicken around here without hitting a farm.   The three walked back into the woods and headed randomly to where the open areas led them keeping track of where they were going.  No one had breadcrumbs to leave behind, but they had a general sense of where the river was and could always head back in that direction and from there find Tobys beaver dam.   For a half hour they walked through the woods stepping on sticks, rocks and whatever could poke them in the feet.  Lisa was getting hurt with every step and noticed her right foot was starting to bleed.   I need to stop, Lisa said looking at her feet.   Whats wrong? Toby said, We have a long way to go yet.   My foot is bleeding, she replied lifting up her foot for Toby to see.   Anne spoke up, If youd let her wear clothes this wouldn't be a problem.   Toby stepped over to Anne and backhanded her across the face.  Dont sass me woman, he said.  I might decide to snap your neck right here and leave you to rot.  One less mouth to feed.   Oh yeah tough guy, still wont fix the problem that Lisa is bleeding and cant go on, you stupid fuck.   Toby shook his head in anger.  Let me see that, he said getting down on one knee.  Lisa raised up her foot and Toby could see a good gash across the front pad of her foot next to her big toe.  It was bleeding nonstop but not profusely.  A good bandage could help, but no one had one.  Fuck, Toby said.   What? Lisa asked.   You might need stitches, or a good bandage.   Anne stepped in close and took a look.  This is all your fault, she said.  You fucking misogynistic pig.  Keeping her naked for your own pleasure.   I lived all my life naked lady, this isnt a big deal to me.   Then why are you wearing clothes? Anne asked like a bitch.   I dont have to answer to you, Toby said dropping Lisas foot and moving closer to Anne.   Anne stood her ground and didnt back up.  Go for it asshole, she said.   Toby cocked his hand back as to punch Anne in the face and hesitated.  He looked over to Lisa who was starting to cry and back at Anne.  He then put his hand back down.  He then grabbed ahold of Annes shirt and tried to tear a piece off.  He couldnt.   What are you doing? Anne asked.   I need to wrap her foot, Toby replied.   Anne rolled her eyes and tore a long piece of her shirt from the bottom and handed it to Toby.  There you go, she said as snarky as she could.   Toby took the cloth and walked back over to Lisa keeping an eye on Anne.  He didnt think she was going to run, he wanted to intimidate her.  He then got back down on one knee and wrapped Lisas foot the best he could and tied it off.   Lisa put her foot down and bared weight on it.   Hows that? Toby asked.  Then he felt a smack in the head and fell to the ground.  Looking up he saw Anne holding a three foot long stick.   Asshole, Anne said.   What are you doing mom? Lisa asked.   Teaching that fucking beaver a lesson, Anne replied.   Toby tried to get up but was beat down by repeated strikes from the stick.  It was heavy, and very effective.  The last strike hit him in the ear and the sting sent Toby straight to the ground holding his head in agony.   That had to hurt, Anne said.   Youre just going to piss him off! Lisa yelled.   He pissed me off, Anne said waiting for Toby to try to get back up.   Hes going to get up and kill you.   Anne stepped in close and hit Toby a few more times in the head.  By now he was bleeding and disoriented.  Every time he tried to get up, he flopped back down losing his balance.   What did you do? Lisa asked.   I hit him in the head a few times pretty well, Anne said.  He might be down for good.   Now what are we going to do? Lisa asked.   Lets get the hell out of here, Anne said.  She took Lisa by the hand and left Toby lying in his own blood on the ground.  She kept the big stick in her hand.  As fast as they could, they walked away from the river deeper into the woods minding Lisas bleeding foot.  The woods looked the same in all directions and the further they went, the more lost they felt.  All they knew was they had to put some distance between them and Toby.   Then they stopped when they heard a noise, a noise like a low humming engine.  And then they smelled smoke, not like that of burning wood, but of burning oil.  Where is that coming from? Lisa asked.   Both stood and listened close.  Anne pointed to her left and said, Over there,  Yeah, I think youre right, Lisa said and they two headed off in that direction.  More woods and hills until they came to a clearing and saw a backhoe digging a hole along the side of a field.  Smoke poured out of the machines exhaust and the motor hummed, only louder.   Thank God! Lisa said and took off as fast as she could towards the machine.  It was like her foot didnt hurt at all.        26   Backhoe      Once Lisa got to the backhoe, she stopped in horror.  She recognized the man operating as Paul, the man who captured her and Judd at the photo shoot.  He must have been released from jail.  She then noticed three bodies lying on the ground waiting to be buried.  They made eye contact for a moment and the backhoe stopped.  Paul jumped out and ran over to Lisa who was trying her best to run on an injured foot.  Paul shoved her to the ground with a thud and came face to face with Anne.   What the hell are you doing? Anne yelled at Paul.   Mom, watch out! This is the guy who kidnapped me and Judd! Lisa yelled.   What are you talking about?  Paul spoke up, Your girly here was taking naked pictures on my property.  I had every right to lock her up, Paul said.   Youre mother forced Judd to jerk off into a cup! Lisa yelled.   She forced me too, you dont see me bitching, Paul replied.   Where is momma? Lisa asked.  Who are you burying?  Mama's dead, your asshole friend killed her, Paul replied.   Good, she needed to be dead, sadistic bitch, whos on the ground over there?  Trespassers, Paul replied.  Like you are, again!  You cant go around abducting everyone that comes onto your property, there are laws about that kind of stuff.  Lisa said.   All I know is that I need to dig a wider hole now, I got two more.   You arent going to get me twice asshole, Lisa said.   Paul knew he left his gun in the cab of the backhoe.  He hesitated and looked back, Lisa caught on right away and lunged at Paul grabbing him by his legs.  She then shouted, Mom, get his gun! Look in the drivers seat!  Anne took off and Paul tried to get away but Lisas grip was too tight.  Anne ran to the backhoe, climbed up inside and grabbed Pauls rifle.  Back on the ground she ran over and pointed it at Paul and yelled, Dont move!  Paul stopped trying to get free and let of Lisa, You know how that works? he asked.   Anne pointed the gun over Pauls head and pulled on the trigger, nothing.   Paul smiled realizing that Anne had no clue the gun was on safety.  He wasnt going to tell her either.  With a swift kick of his boot, he pushed Lisa away and stood back up.  Whats the problem lady? Dont know how to shoot?  Anne turned the gun looking at the stock and trigger guard trying to figure out why the gun didnt work.  It all looked like a mess to her and she didnt understand what all the parts did.  The gun was useless to her.  But she wasnt going to give it back to Paul.   Paul stepped in towards Anne, Anne backed up and took off running towards the woods leaving Lisa behind on the ground.   Looks like your momma left you, Paul said with a smile.   My mom will be back fuck head! Lisa yelled.  Im not worried about that.   Then an awkward silence as Anne did not return.  Paul looked down at Lisa and said, Where is she?  Lisa looked over to the woods and saw only trees and grass.  She didnt have an answer.   Stay there while I run you over, Paul said.  He walked back over to the back hoe and crawled into the cab.  He put the machine in reverse and looked over his shoulder trying to line up with Lisa who was trying to get up.  Once he had his heading, he popped the clutch and backed up hitting her with the shovel blade.  That wasnt his intention and it knocked her down allowing the wheels to pass on each side of her.  Fuck, Paul said no longer able to see Lisa who was now underneath the machine.  Now hed have to get back out and pull her somewhere where he could get a better run at her.   But before he could open the door, he saw her taking off to his left towards the house.  The backhoe could go about twenty five miles an hour on smooth ground, but this field was plowed with huge ruts that would bog him down.  It was time to get back on his feet and run her down.   Then Paul heard the crack of a gunshot and turned around.  It was Anne standing at the edge of the woods with a man holding a rifle.  From the distance, it looked like the man had blood all over his face, but it was a blur as Paul took off running to save his own hide.  He no longer cared about Lisa that shot was too close and he didnt want to end up in the hold he had just dug.   Did you hit him? Anne asked Toby.   I cant see straight, Toby replied.   Try again! Anne yelled.   You try! Toby yelled, I got the safety off, now its up to you.   Anne took the rifle and tried to line it up with Paul who was a good two hundred yards away by now.  She squeezed off a shot and missed by a mile.  Fuck, Ive never shot a rifle before.  She did see that Lisa was safe and that Paul was heading off in a different direction.   Together, they walked over to the bodies lying on the ground to see who they were.  Neither one recognized them, they looked like      Ten minutes later, Lisa, Anne and Toby were at Pauls house, Toby broke open the back door and they all entered inside.  Lisa shuttered as she recalled being held hostage in this house and didnt like the idea of being back.  But they had to stay somewhere for now and this was the best they could find.  At least there would be food and clean water.  Then they heard the doorbell ring.   They all looked at each other wondering what to do, then they heard the sound of footsteps from the floor above and a door open.  The thought they were thinking was that Paul was in the house answering the door.  Toby moved over to the stairs and slowly made his way up to the main floor followed by Anne and Lisa who was holding the rifle.  When Toby reached the top of the steps, he peered around the corner and saw Paul talking to the sheriff.  Leaning against the wall, out of the sight of the sheriff was another rifle, or a shotgun, Toby didnt know the difference.   Whats going on? Lisa asked from the middle of the stairs.   Toby put his hand up signaling for her to shut her hole.  He was trying to listen in on the conversation between the sheriff and Paul.  What he heard told him a whole new story.   Paul, were looking for two men and a woman whove been reported missing, the sheriff said to Paul.  They were sighted on your road this morning, did you see them? the sheriff Axl Jackson asked.   No, I didnt see nobody, Paul replied.   Now youre not fucking with me now are you? Youre the kind of redneck fuck that would mess with people like that.   I dont think I like your tone sheriff, Paul said.   Let me be straight with you Paul, I never liked you, or your sick mother, I would be more than happy if a tornado swept in and took you, her and this whole fucked up farm to hell.  Speaking of which, where is your mother?  She passed away in a car accident, Paul lied knowing that Judd smashed her face into a countertop.   Glad to hear it, how did you escape?  You son of a bitch, Paul said.  What did we ever do to you?  Nothing to me personally, but I know your type, freaks that hide out in your bunkers, think the worlds after you, probably have a statue of Hitler in your living room.   Youre making a lot of assumptions sheriff, Paul said.   Where do you keep you statue of Hitler then? the sheriff asked.   Do you have a warrant? Paul asked.   Warrant for what?  To be on my property.   I dont need a warrant to be on your property, Im just here asking questions, why? Are you hiding something?  The image of the three dead bodies in the back field popped into Pauls mind.  No, I dont.   The sheriff looked at Pauls facial expression and knew he was lying.  Pauls arms were crossed and he kept looking at the floor.  Mind if I take a look? the sheriff asked.   Yes I do, Paul replied.   Why? What will I find?  Nothing, my momma told me never to let anyone snoop around ever, this is my property, and we paid for it.   And its my job as sheriff to uphold the law,  Fucking government asshole, Paul said.  He was about ready to go for his gun but decided to play it cool.   Im on your side Paul, I dont enforce some of the law, I enforce all the law, if you had a trespasser, and youd call me, right? Then Id come out and take care of that for you.  I work for all taxpayers.   I take care of my own problems, Paul said.   What problems? Did you see those three out here? Did you take care of them?  Paul looked at the sheriff and back at the ground, he shuffled in the doorway and shook his head no.  I dont know what youre talking about.  I didnt see anyone.  Dont you listen?  I do listen, and what I hear makes me think youre hiding something.  I think Ill contact the judge about getting a search warrant and checking out your property, the sheriff said.   Under what cause? You cant just make shit up!  You are very evasive, that is probable cause in my book, and I think the judge will agree with me.   Just because I dont allow you to search my property? This is America, I have rights! Paul snapped back.   So do those three missing people, they have the right to be found.  I think you know where they are, I think you might be holding them, the sheriff said.  He put his hand close to his sidearm.   Do what you want sheriff, Paul said sternly.  Nobodys coming on my property period.   From behind Paul, the sheriff saw a figure move.  Spooked, the sheriff took out his pistol and pointed it at the man standing behind Paul.  Who is that? the sheriff asked.   Paul turned around to see Toby standing behind him.  In a panic, Paul reached for his gun, but before he could get to it, Toby pushed Paul out the door and into the sheriff.  Toby grabbed the gun and tossed it back further into the room away from Pauls reach.   Anne and Lisa came up behind Toby and Lisa handed him the rifle.  Grab that gun, Toby said looking over to where he tossed it.   Then the sound of gunshots cracked from outside and Toby looked to see the sheriff shooting from the porch.  It looked like Paul took off running and the sheriff was trying to mow him down.  The sheriff then turned to Toby, pistol in hand and yelled, Put down the gun!  Toby dropped the rifle on the ground and put his hands up.  Get out here on the porch! All of you! the sheriff yelled.   Toby and the two women walked out onto the porch.   On the ground, face down, hands behind your back! the sheriff yelled.   The three complied and the sheriff called for backup on his radio.  Who the fuck are you? the sheriff asked.  Im looking for two men and one woman, not one man and two women.   I know who youre looking for! Anne yelled.  He killed them, they are in the field.  He was going to bury them.   That fuck wad! the sheriff yelled in an adrenaline fueled panic.  Who are you?  Anne didnt want to say anything, she was a fugitive and talking to the sheriff would land her right back in prison.  But she was fucked anyway.  Anne Marie, she said.   Anne? I didnt recognize you without your uniform on and your tit hanging out, the sheriff said.   Toby said his name and then Lisa.  The sheriff knew Lisa, she was the girl he was looking for way back when he entered the diner.   Why are you naked? the sheriff asked Lisa.  Are you still taking porn pictures out in the country?  No, I didnt get a chance too, that fuck kidnapped me and Judd.   What kind of whore are you? the sheriff asked.  I know your momma is gutter trash, but I thought maybe her kids would be different.   Fuck you, Lisa said.   Sorry, I dont have fifty bucks, the sheriff replied.        27   Booby-trap      The smell of smoke filled the air and pops and bangs could be heard from behind the house.  The sheriff knew something was up and backed off the porch keeping his pistol pointed at the three laying on their faces.   Whats going on? Anne asked in a panic.   Get up! the sheriff yelled, Get away from the house now!  The three stood up and took off down the steps tripping over each other to get away from what seemed like a burning house.  The smoke now poured out the front door and more popping sounds could be heard.  Then a crack of a rifle and Anne hit the ground.  There was no time to stop, the house was now burning with flames shooting out of the windows and holes that seemed to burst from the roof.   Its booby-trapped! the sheriff yelled.  The house has bombs in it, get back to the road! he yelled.   Toby stopped and kneeled down to check on Anne, she had a gunshot to the side of her head that trickled a small amount of blood onto the ground.  She was motionless and looking vacantly at the open field.  Toby knew Paul was going to pick them off one by one.   Lisa ran to the road and looked back wondering why nobody followed her, then she saw her mother lying on the ground with Toby running from her.  Whats wrong with mom? she yelled.   Shes been shot! Get to the sheriffs truck and get inside! Toby yelled.   More shots from the rifle cracked in the air and the smoke was thick like paint.  Neither Toby nor Lisa could see where the sheriff was and felt like sitting ducks, but the metal of the cab gave them some sense of relief, although a high power rifle round would slice through the cab like it wasnt there.   We have to get the fuck out of here! Lisa yelled.   Toby looked at the ignition and saw no keys.  He has the keys, we cant go anywhere, he replied.   Find the sheriff, get the keys! she yelled.   Then she heard the sound of glass breaking and saw a spot in the windshield where a bullet passed through.  Then another.  She huddled down into her seat and waited for the next shot.  Toby didnt want to wait, he got out of the truck and ran back to where he had last seen the sheriff.  Lying on the ground, with one shot to the chest, Sheriff Axl Jackson lie wounded.   Help me! the sheriff pleaded.   Give me your keys, Toby said holding out his hand.  Ill get help.   I called for backup already, get me away from here, the sheriff said.   Toby had no intention of dragging the sheriff across the ground leaving himself exposed.  All he wanted was his keys, so he bent down and dug through his pockets.   What are you doing? the sheriff asked pushing Toby away.   Toby placed his knee on the sheriffs arm, keeping him from grabbing him and found his keys in his right pants pocket.  Once he had them, he stood up and ran back to the truck.  Then he heard a rifle crack and expected to be hit, but nothing.  The shot motivated him more and he sprinted back to the truck where he found Lisa lying with a bullet wound to her right shoulder.   Are you alright? Toby asked.   Lisa leaned up in her seat and said, Did you get the keys?  Yes.   Get us the fuck out of here! she yelled and laid back down.   Toby started the truck and pulled away leaving the burning house behind him.  In the distance he could hear the sounds of sirens and knew help was on the way, but now he was driving a stolen sheriffs vehicle and left a wounded man behind to die.  As soon as the first turn came up, Toby made a right and sped off away from town so he wouldnt cross paths with the emergency vehicles responding to the sheriffs call.   Where are you going? Lisa asked.   Anywhere but back to town, we need to get back to my beaver dam, Toby replied.   I need to get to a hospital!  I just left a man to die, Im not going to run to town so they can lock me up.  Toby looked at Lisas wound.  Youre not bleeding that bad, youll live.   I cant live with a bullet in me, itll get infected, Lisa plead.   Toby continued down the road in the direction of the river.  Once there he could abandon the truck and follow the river back home.   Did you hear me?  Toby slammed on the breaks and stopped the truck on the gravel road.  Get out! he yelled.   Lisa didnt move.   If you want to go so bad, get out now!  Why cant you take me?  I told you, you stupid bitch, now get out of shut the fuck up.  Make up your mind because Im going in ten seconds.   Lisa looked at Toby and grit her teeth, she was pissed but she wasnt about to walk back to the house.  Or was she? She decided it was best to leave and get help so she grabbed the door handle and before she could move it, Toby took off spinning his tires heading back down the gravel road.   What are you doing? she asked.   I didnt think youd go, Toby replied.   Stop the truck now!  Toby ignored Lisa and continued down the road at a speed way too fast for the conditions.  Hills and gravel out in the country can spell disaster.       Four hours later, Toby and Lisa were back at the beaver dam.  They had abandon the truck at the bridge and waded down the river.  Lisa made sure she kept her open wound from touching the filthy river water.  At the dam, Lisa sat on the bank while Toby found his magic box.   What are you doing with that? she asked.   This thing has power, I need to figure out how to use it, Toby replied.   Its just a box with a dead baby inside, its not magic.   Toby pulled the skull out and held it in his hand.  He examined the face and turned it around looking for anything unusual.  It was small, but not misshapen or odd in anyway.  He poured the rest of the bones into the lid making sure he didnt spill any on the ground.  The business card was still there, but otherwise there was nothing else.  Fuck, he said shaking his head.   Whats on the bottom of the box? Lisa said.  She could see the bottom when Toby set the box on the ground.   Toby picked up the box and saw writing.  It was one sentence in the form of a riddle.  To unlock my power, name three things that have eyes yet cannot see, he read aloud.   A needle, Lisa said.   What else? Toby asked.   Potatoes have eyes, Lisa replied.   I need one more.   Both Toby and Lisa sat on the river bank racking their brains trying to think of a third answer.  Neither one could think of anything.  A blind person? Toby asked.  He was sure he was right and waited for the power of the box to be unleashed, but nothing.  Thats a valid answer, he said.   Obviously the box disagrees, Lisa replied.  I dont think the question is about literal eyes, it has to be something that is called an eye.   Im hungry, Toby said.  We need to find some food and water, fuck, were right back where we started from, without your mother of course.   Yeah, thanks for bringing that up, Im sure youre glad shes gone, one less mouth to feed, Lisa said.   Hey, I didnt kill her, that crazy farmer fuck did.  Hey that reminds me, I wonder if he had a water jug or some food in that backhoe.   Probably full of chewing tobacco if there is, Lisa said.   Better than dying of dehydration.   Im in no mood to walk back to the farmhouse and see those dead bodies on the ground.  Plus, hes still on the loose.   Toby leaned back on his hands and looked up at the late afternoon sky.  Gonna be dark soon, he said.  Looks like it might storm.   Lisa did one of those double takes like a chicken cocking its head.  Did you say storm?  Yeah, why?  Thats the answer, a storm.  Storms have eyes, Lisa said.   Toby sad back up and picked up the box.  He dumped the skeleton back in the box and put the lid back on.  Let me try this.  Box, the answer to your riddle is needle, potato and storm.  He waited for the magic and again nothing happened.  Pissed, he put the box back down and crossed his arms, but before he could get too far, Lisa noticed something.   Look at your hand, She said.  The one that was holding the box.   Toby looked at his hand and saw long hairs sticking out, long hairs like he had when he was a beaver.  What the hell? he said looking at his hand.  Whats going on? he asked.   Youre turning back into a beaver, Lisa said.  Its running down your arm now.   Toby watched as his arm transformed from human into beaver, hairs grew and his arm grew smaller.  With every second he became less human and more a wood eating water based rodent.  No, I liked be human, I dont want to change back, he said to his dismay.   In less than five minutes, Toby was totally transformed back into a furry little beaver with two buck teeth for cutting wood.  The clothes he was wearing were now laying on the ground next to him.  He was in shock and pissed as hell.   Are you alright? Lisa asked.   Im fine, just very disappointed, Toby replied.  He looked over at Lisa and saw that her wound was gone, not healed, gone.  Look at your shoulder, he said.   Lisa looked at where the bullet hit and saw there wound was gone.  Im healed! The magic box worked!  Then they heard a familiar voice reply from the edge of the woods, Thought you could get away? Paul said.   Both Toby and Lisa looked over and saw Paul standing at the edge of the woods holding a rifle.   Wheres your friend? Paul asked.   Lisa looked at Toby and back to Paul.  He left me, ran off, she replied.   Chicken shit, Paul said.  Whose clothes are those? he asked.   I dont know, there were here when I got here, Lisa replied.   Paul raised his rifle and pointed it at Toby, Looks like I have lunch figured out, and took a shot missing Toby by inches.  Toby scurried as fast as he could to the river bank and dove in as Paul took two more shots that missed.  Fuck, my sights need adjustment bad, he said.   For what seemed a long moment, both Paul and Lisa had an awkward silence as neither knew what to say to the other.  They didnt think theyd see each other again.   Then Lisa spoke up.  Now what? she asked.   Dont know, need to think about it for a while, the sheriffs deputies and the state patrol are out looking for me, so I cant stay too long, but maybe I rape the shit out of you for the fun of it.   Lisa crossed her arms and legs giving Paul the idea she was off limits and wasnt going to let him have his way easy.  How are you going to do that holding the rifle? Do you think Im going to let you rape me willingly?  I could put a few holes in you first, make it hard to fight back, then when Im done, shoot you in the head and toss you in the river, Paul replied.   What a pathetic fuck, Lisa said.   Yeah, you run around naked all the time, you must be some sort of whore anyway, I bet you like getting fucked all the time, Paul said.   Are you saying Im asking for it because of how I look?  A whore is a whore, just like your momma, Paul replied.        28   Bacon      Paul stepped over to Lisa and stood above her with his rifle pointed at her foot.  Couple in the leg should keep you from getting away, he said.  But before he could pull off a shot, Lisa grabbed the magic box and threw it at Paul.  It hit him and fell to the ground intact.  What was that? he asked laughing.  Was that supposed to hurt?  Lisa was disappointed, she expected the box to do something to Paul, but he continued to stand over her with the rifle.  She reached over and picked up the box and turned it over to the bottom to read the riddle again.  This time it had changed.  Now it asked, What is black and white and red all over, She replied out loud, A sunburn penguin, and tossed the box at Paul.  He immediately caught fire and began to burn to a crisp while Lisa watched.  In less than thirty seconds Paul was an ash on the ground with a rifle laying near.   Nice, Toby said from the river.  His head was above water watching what was going on.   Lisa turned to Toby and stood up.  She walked over to the river and stood with her hands on her hips like she was about to explode.  I am so sick of this shit! I just want to go home and have a normal life, she said.   Sorry honey, you can head back whenever you want, Im a beaver again and I can live here like I used to.   No! You are going to help me! Im twenty miles from home, still naked, and starving.  I havent had a shower in days, or a drink of water and Im about to pass out of sheer exhaustion.   There are a shitload of cops out there looking for the asshole you just torched.  Go find one, theyll take you home, Toby said.  And you can put on my clothes, I dont need them anymore.   Lisa looked at the shirt and pants lying on the ground.  They were way too big and filthy, by now she was used to running around with no clothes on and the idea of wearing Tobys old shirt and pants grossed her out.  No thanks, she said and stepped into the river.   Its gonna be dark soon, you need a place to sleep, Toby said.   Can I fit in there? she asked looking at the beaver dam.   No, youll have to sleep on the bank, it gets pretty cold out at night.  You better find something to cover up with.   What I need is a fire, Lisa said.   And every cop will be here, if thats what you want.   I dont know if thats what I want or not, she replied.  On one hand I want to go back, but I know once I do my life will be on display, probably have reporters and cops bothering me constantly.   You wanted to be a star right? This all started when you were going for a photo shoot.  Why not milk it? Use the publicity.   Lisa thought Toby may be onto something, but there was one problem.  I never got any pictures taken, I have nothing to publicize.   You can shoot pictures afterwards, Toby said.   By then nobody will care.   Well, I dont have a camera so youre shit out of luck, Toby said.   Im going to at least stay the night here before I make any decisions.  And I will need a fire, Im not freezing my ass off, Lisa said.   You hiding a lighter?  No.   Ever build a fire from scratch before?  No.   Then tell me how you plan to start a fire, Toby asked.   I guess Im not, Lisa said.   Then use my clothes as a blanket.   Lisa stepped back up onto the river bank and picked up Tobys clothes.  They smelled like week old sweat.  These are so fucking gross, she said.   Keep you warm, better to be alive than pretty.   I have a better idea, Lisa said.  Lets go back to Lancaster.   Toby swam around on his back for a while before answering.  You want to go back down that death tube?  Not really, but at least there they dont know me and I can start over.  They were less judgmental there.   The grass isnt greener on the other side, and you couldnt wait to get back to Sparksville, remember? You sold me out just to get away.   I remember, Lisa said.   You have to make the best of where you are, not run away when things get shitty, Toby said.   My moms gone, and I dont have anything to keep me here, Lisa said.   Do you plan to become a famous model in Lancaster? You could do that here if you put some effort into it.   Im not sure I want to be a model anymore.   Doesnt matter, spend the night, get cleaned up and go home.   I probably dont have a home to go to, I havent been to work in a week, probably dont have a job anymore and cant pay my rent.  Im basically homeless.   Well, Ive heard of people being raised by wolves in the jungle, I guess you can live in the woods with a beaver, Toby said.       The next morning Lisa woke to the smell of bacon.  There was a fire and a jug of clean water.  She looked to see Toby cooking and stirring a pot of beans.  Where did this come from? Lisa asked.   Went back to the house and stole it.  It was hard, the fire marshal was still out there investigating, Toby said.   Lisa crawled over and took some bacon off the stick it was hanging from.  She ate it quickly and took another till they were all gone.  Dont bother heating the beans, I like them cold, she said.  For the next twenty minutes, Lisa ate till she was full and licked the bean juice out of the can.  She downed a quart of clean water and felt better than she had in days.  Was that really bacon? Or did you cut a chunk off of Paul? she asked with a smile.  She was joking, but in the back of her mind maybe she was right.  She looked to Toby to be reassured, he ignored her and chewed on a stick.   I miss sticks.  Toby said.  Youre human food tastes like oil and shit.   Thanks for getting this, she said.   Didnt want you to die out here, dont want your rotting carcass smelling up the place, Toby replied.   Thats so special, she said with a wink.  Did you happen to find any clothes while you were gone? Lisa asked.   No, I like you naked, Toby replied.   Why?  Im naked, so you should be too.   Thats nature, youre supposed to be naked, Lisa said.   If you were supposed to wear clothes, youd be born with clothes.   I think you like what you see, Lisa said.   Toby took a look at Lisa and replied, You have flabby tits and funny shaped nipples.  Youre snatch looks like a clam, and overall you look like an ape that shaved.   You look like something I took out of a rat trap once, only bigger, Lisa replied with a smile.   Youd be better off as a beaver, I dont have a job, I live in a nice beaver dam, I dont have to shop for clothes and I eat all the bark I can find.   Although I admire your woodsy outdoors attitude, I dont think bark would taste very good, and from watching you, it looks like it takes an hour to chew, Lisa said.   The best kind does, the dry crusty stuff falls apart and usually tastes like termite shit, Toby replied.   Lisa sat up and looked at the river.  Now what? she asked.   What do you mean?  I cant live on stolen bacon forever, I need a plan.   I thought we discussed this, Toby said spitting out a bug.   We did, and I decided I want to go back to Lancaster and start fresh.   Toby shook his head.  Have fun with that.   Youre coming with me, she said.   Sorry, I got what I need here, last thing I need is some stupid woman dragging me into a hole and upsetting my life again.   What can I do to change your mind? Lisa asked.   If I had nothing else to live for I guess Id go, Toby said.   Lisa reached over and grabbed a burning stick from the fire and tossed it onto Tobys beaver dam.  It sparked and smoked and fell in between the other sticks.  There you go, you wont have any place to live in about an hour.   Toby swam over to his dam and splashed water with his tail onto the dam until the smoke stopped.  No, got to do better than that, he said.  Plus, I could rebuild my dam in a week.   Ill pick you up and take you with me, she said.   I got claws now bitch, try it, Toby said with a grin.   Fuck! I cant stay here and you wont go with me, what the hell am I supposed to do? Lisa asked.   Youre shit out of luck girlfriend, Toby said.  You might want to start building a shelter and looking for food.   Lisa picked up the magic box and had an idea, I bet this does more than just fix people and turn them back into beavers.   Like what? Toby said swimming on his back.   Like grant wishes.   I doubt it, Toby said.  Its not a genie, you cant just rub it and get what you want.   Ive rubbed lots of things and got what I wanted, Lisa laughed.   I bet that joke goes over well at the whore house.   Lisa took that comment badly.  Fuck you, She said and rubbed the box.  I wish that Toby would be my slave and do whatever I ask, she said.   Toby continued to swim.   It was a longshot, but Lisa had to give it a try so she tried it out.  Toby, come up here and get a burning stick and light your dam on fire, she said.   Without hesitation, Toby swam out of the water and did as she commanded.  He picked up a burning stick and tossed it on a dry spot and waited for the whole pile of wood to light up.  It took about twenty minutes, but once lit, it burned hot and quick.  In less than an hour, the entire dam was burned to the waters edge.   Why did I do that? Toby asked looking at the pile of ashes floating down the river.   Because I commanded you, Lisa said still holding the magic box.   What else can it do? Make you a house? Get you some new clothes? Toby asked.   I think it only works on living things, not objects, Lisa said.   Try it, Toby said.   Lisa rubbed the box and said, I want some clean clothes.  Nothing happened.  I want a place to live, she said.  Still nothing.   Maybe you said it wrong, Toby said.   Lisa reworded it, I wish I had clean clothes.  Nothing happened.  I wish Toby would rub my feet, she said and Toby waddled over and rubbed her feet.  Yeah, doesnt work on objects, just living things.   I dont think I should be rubbing your feet, you still have a nasty wound, Toby said.   Lisa grabbed the box and said, I wish my foot was healed, and instantly her foot was healed.   Better than the hospital, and no charge, Toby said.  Is there anything else I can do for you? Toby asked.   Yeah, get ready to leave this shit hole.        29   Waterbed      Lisa broke the surface of the swimming pool followed by Toby to find a large man floating on a Styrofoam lounger near the edge.  The man was sipping on a drink and was resting in the shade of the umbrella propped up above him attached to the lounger.  Up on the edge of the pool, on the cement was a fat woman in a one piece swimming suit reading a book.  Walking along the edge was a butler wearing a tuxedo carrying a tray of snacks back to the house.   Looks like we have company this time, Toby said.   Lisa swam to the edge farthest from the man in the floating lounger and got out of the pool followed by Toby.  She didnt know if anyone saw her till she heard a woman's voice call out, Excuse me, this is a private pool.   Lisa turned to see the woman with the book looking at her.  Shit, She said under her breath and tried to play it off like it was no big deal.  Sorry, we wont do it again, she said.   We? Whos we? the woman asked.   Me and my beaver, Lisa said pointing to Toby who was now walking around the pool edge on the hot concrete.   You let a rat in my pool? the woman asked in an outrage.  Henry, get your gun and shoot that rat! she said.   No! Hes not a rat, hes my friend, Lisa said.   You have a rat as a pet? What kind of riff raff are you?  Lisa walked over to the woman, water dripping from her nude body in the sun.  The closer she got, the more interested the woman became.  You do realize there is a cave that leads to your pool dont you? I cant be the first person to come through here.   No, I had no idea.  Henry, did you know about a cave in our pool? she asked.   Henry, a gross, fat and bald man replied, No dear.   Doesnt matter anyway, this is my pool and you cant swim in it without my permission.  And under no circumstance can you let your pet rat swim in it either.   Toby stepped over to the woman, mindful of the hot concrete and stopped in the shade she made.  Im not a rat, Im a beaver, he said.   The woman looked at Toby like he was a freak.  A beaver? she asked.  Shouldnt you be in the woods cutting down trees or whatever beavers do?  I was about five minutes ago, then we got in the river, got sucked into the cave and got shit out here in your pool.   Thats quite the story, the woman said.  If thats so, what are you planning to do now?  Id like to go find that witch that cut off my tail and made me into stew, Toby replied.   The woman looked at Tobys backside and said, You have a tail.   I know, long story.   And you? the woman asked Lisa.   I dont know yet, I want to be a model, but for now I just need a job.   A job? Huh, I might be able to help you out with that.  Henry, can I hire this girl? We need a maid.   Henry hated his wife, she spent his money like it was water.  But he always gave in because not giving in was far worse.  Sure, anything for my dear wife.   Would you like a job as a maid? the woman asked.   Lisa was put on the spot, but it did save her the trouble of finding clothes and going out job hunting.  Sure, how much does it pay?  I can pay you one fifty a week, you can stay in the downstairs bedroom.  The rat has to sleep out in back.   Hes a beaver, Lisa said.   Fine, hes a beaver, he can stay if he keeps up the yard and pool.   Toby spoke up, Do I get one fifty a week too?  No, you get to not have me call animal control on you, the woman asked.   Thats a nice offer, Lisa said, May I ask your name?  Theresa, Theresa replied.  Theresa and Henry Snow.  Let me show you your room and what youll be doing.   Theresa rolled off her pool lounger like a fat cow.  She needed a lift but somehow managed to get her cellulite in an upright position and walk to the house.  Once inside she took Lisa downstairs to her room and showed her where shed be sleeping.  This room is where our last hired girl lived, she left three months ago.   Why? Lisa asked.   Got knocked up by the gardener, thats why your rat will be mowing the lawn from now on.  She left her uniform, I think it should fit you, what is your shoe size?  Eight, nine sometimes, Lisa replied.   Theresa pulled open the closet door and bend over scooping up a pair of black four inch heels.  She looked at the writing on the inside and said, Eight, perfect.  and handed them to Lisa.   She worked in these? Lisa asked.   Yes, and look in the dresser, Theresa said.   Lisa walked over to the dresser and pulled open the top drawer, all she found was a pile of thigh high panty hose on one side and a few pair of garters on the other.  She pulled open the other drawers and found nothing.  Where are the clothes? Lisa asked.   Thats it, heels, stockings and garters, thats the uniform, Theresa replied.  On nights we have guests, there is a head band is it in there?  Lisa pushed the garters and stockings around, No, she replied.  Ill give you some money to get a few new ones.   Wait, you expect me to work in this? My feet will kill me, Lisa said.   The jobs not hard, all you have to do is some light housekeeping, dust and maybe take out the garbage, the butler does the rest.   I dont get it, what am I here for? Lisa asked.   Mostly eye candy, we like to impress our friends and having a maid does that.   I get the feeling there is more to the job than youre letting on, Lisa said.   Well, I like the eye candy as well, Theresa replied.   Am I thinking what I think Im thinking?  What?  That Im going to end up a private pay live in prostitute?  I was hoping to get into that later on, but since you brought it up, yes.   And this room is where all the magic is supposed to happen?  Oh no, I have a room set aside for that, Theresa said moving in close to Lisa.  Lisa backed up and her calves hit the bed.  Theresa gently pushed her back onto the bed and put a knee on the edge moving down on top of the new maid.  At first Lisa was sure shed be crushed, but the bed turned out to be a waterbed and Theresas weight didn't seem all that crushing as she laid down on top of her.  Do you know how long its been since Ive been with a girl? Theresa asked.   Lisa shook her head no.   Theresa licked Lisas neck and replied, Damn too long and went in for an open mouth kiss.  Lisa took the kiss and put her tongue in her new bosss mouth and played with her tongue.  At first she thought shes be grossed out but found making out with her boss exciting.  The more the two kissed, the more the bed bounced around and Lisa found herself pulling Theresas swimming suit off rolling her back and forth.  In a few minutes, both women were nude with Theresa sucking on Lisas neck, fingering her between her legs.   You like that? Theresa asked.   Lisa put her hand on her bosses hand and pushed her fingers in deeper.  Move them around more, Lisa said dripping wet.   You are such a dirty girl, Theresa said.   Shut up and kiss me, Lisa said and lip locked Theresa squeezing a huge boob.   For the next ten minutes, Theresa masturbated Lisa as the two made out, then Theresa changed positions and got on her back.  I want you to eat me, and I want to taste that wet pussy of yours, she said.   Lisa turned around and laid the opposite way of her boss and rested her full weight on top of her.  Theresa spread her legs and Lisa lapped at Theresas pussy like it was a lollypop.  Theresa did the same to her.  Now in ecstasy, the woman licked each other until they both blew their wads and dripped all over the bed with pussy juice.  It was then that Lisa realized shed have to do laundry.  She raised her head and asked, Is laundry my job or the butlers job?  The butler does all the laundry, he knows how to get cum stains out of the sheets, Theresa replied.   Lisa rolled off her boss and asked, Wheres my shower?  Your shower is just past your bedroom door to the left, I had it installed just for the help.  Its extra wide if you know what I mean, Theresa said with a smile.   Do you know where Toby went? Lisa asked.   No, but he better not be in the house, if I catch that shedding little rat anywhere inside, hell be dead.   No need to be hostile, hes very nice, college educated, probably could do more than yard work if you gave him a chance, Lisa said.   Like what?  Balance your checkbook, do your taxes, stuff like that, Lisa replied.   Well start with him fishing the leaves out of the pool and weeding the flowers.  Im not sure hes tall enough to run the mower, his legs might not reach the pedals.       Outside, Toby was watching Lisa and Theresa from the window that shown into the bedroom.  He watched them go at each other and got a little beaver woody.  He turned to Henry who had now floated to his end of the pool.  Did you know your wife was a lesbian? Toby asked.   Henry looked at Toby and noticed his little beaver hard on.  I hope that isnt for me, Henry replied.   No, I just watched your wife sixty nine my friend for a half hour in the basement bedroom.  Are you cool with that? Toby asked.   Yeah, I get mine of the side too, Henry replied sipping on his drink.   You going to fuck Lisa?  No, my wife has her own, I have my own, I fuck the butler, Henry said.   The butler? Toby asked.   Yeah, I like dick, Henry said.  Me and Charles have been butt ramming each other for years.  He knows how I like it.   Thats fucking gross, Toby said.   I agree, it really is, but when youre in the middle of pumping that fine ass, you forget how gross it is and go for gold, plus I keep his prostate in good condition.  Not a bad bonus for a man his age.   How old is he? Toby asked.   Id say seventy five, Henry replied.   How old was he when you hired him?  I think he was in his forties back then.   So youve been butt fucking your butler for thirty-five years?  Im no Stephen Hawkings, but I think your math is correct, Henry replied.   So your marriage has been some sort of scam this whole time?  You stupid rat, marriage isnt all sex, I love my wife dearly, I just find her grotesque when it comes to sex.  Shes fat, and I mean fat, and her privates look like a greasy taco.  I cant eat Mexican food just for that reason.   I see, so do you have a place I can sleep? Is there a shed or something out here? Toby asked.   Yes, behind the trees youll find a building full of lawn and pool equipment, you can make a bed in there.   Thanks, Ill go check it out.   Thats a fine idea, Charles is due to come suck me off in ten minutes, it might be best if you werent here.        30   Studio      Later that day Lisa and Toby went down to the mini mall to buy the head band Theresa wanted for the maid uniform.  On the way they came across a portrait studio and took a look at the pictures in the window.   These are so pretty, Lisa said.  I want to be a model damn it, Ill never get to live my dreams.   Toby wasnt as impressed, he didnt think human women were that good looking.  Dont bother, its all a scam anyway, he said.   I want to go in.   Why?  To see how much it costs to get pictures done, Lisa replied.   No, lets go, we have better things to do, Toby said like a baby.   Lisa opened the door and stepped inside, Toby ran up and followed before the door slammed and kept him out.  The inside of the shop had pictures all over the walls of babies, weddings, family portraits and models.  Sitting behind the counter was a fat guy in a white t-shirt looking at a magazine smoking an e cigarette.   Hello? Lisa said to the man getting his attention.   What can I do for you? he asked looking at the naked girl across the counter.   I was thinking about getting some modeling pictures done and wanted to know how much that would cost.   Prices are on the wall over there, he said pointing to the wall to his right.  Most of the women I shoot dont get naked until they book a shoot.   Oh, I seem to always be nude, its good for an overall tan, Lisa said walking over to the poster with the prices listed.  She was very disappointed to see how expensive it was to hire a professional photographer.  Do you give discounts, or take coupons? she asked.   Sorry, price is whats listed, rent at this mall is outrageous, he replied.  Takes me half a month just to pay my bills before I see anything for myself.   It would take me three months to earn enough to hire you, do you have a smaller package deal?  Like what? he asked.   Like instead of fifty proofs I get twenty five, and you dont have to edit them.   The photographer looked at Lisa and scanned her up and down.  Youll want editing, you got some nasty acne around your coochie, and you really need to shave, hairy pussy is out these days, this isnt the seventies.   Toby spoke up from the door, Lets go, I can shoot you sometime, just borrow a camera from your boss.   Who let the rat in my shop? the photographer asked.   Hes not a rat, hes my beaver, and hes trying to take care of me, Lisa said.   Yeah, anybody can take a picture, Ill grant you that, but not everyone can create magic with a lens, thats where you need someone with talent and experience.   Lisa looked at Toby and shook her head.  Told you so.   Plus you dont want every picture to look like it was taken by a two year old, he cant be more than a foot and a half tall, the photographer said.   I wish Judd were here, he was going to do the shoot for free, Lisa said.   Is this Judd a friend of yours?  Yeah, real talented, he did it as a hobby.   Toby spoke up again, Lets go, we have a head band thingy to buy and you dont have any money.   Hes right, Im broke right now, just started a new job today.   Yeah, where at?  Im a private maid for a couple in town, Lisa explained.   May I ask who they are?  The wifes name is Theresa and her husband is Henry, I never did get their last name.   Snow, the photographer said.  I shot their daughters wedding twenty years ago.  Rich old coots.   They did seem to have a lot of money.   Is he still butt fucking the help? the photographer asked with a smile.   Toby spoke up, Yes.   Yeah, that was an interesting shoot, he got drunk and they found him screwing the butler in the kitchen.  Ill never forget that, the photographer said.  So you work for them huh?  You make it sound like a bad thing, Lisa said.   Oh no, probably a pretty good job, are you living in the house?  Yes, in the basement.   I heard the wife likes pretty girls, no wonder they hired you.   If you think Im so pretty why dont you shoot me for free? Lisa asked.   I like your style, I might just do that.   I have time now, Lisa said.  You dont seem too busy.   I have a three oclock coming in, in a half hour, the shoot will take at least ninety minutes, I have a makeup and hair girl do work all my model shoots.   What about tomorrow? Lisa asked.   I wont shoot for free, but I will make you a deal, how does that sound?  I suppose you want me to fuck you too?  If you want, but that wasnt the deal I was going to make.   Whats your idea?  I want you to get your boss to agree to let me shoot at the country club they belong too.  They have a lot of high priced snobs there and I want to get some better paying clientele, the photographer said.   How do I do that? I dont even know they are members that would sound kind of pretentious of me.   Toby spoke up again, Lets go before her gets you fired.   No, all you have to do is tell them Im shooting your model pictures and you want them shot out at the country club.   Why would I want that? Lisa asked.   The grass, the trees, they have three lakes and the best backdrops to shoot anywhere.   I think I should wait until I get to know them better, they might think its odd that I ask right away.   Hell, tell them the truth, tell them you met a photographer and asked about modeling shots and agreed to do them for free for access to the country club.   But Im not a member, they are, Lisa pleaded.  I cant give you permission.   The photographer took a deep breath and let out.  He was frustrated and didnt know what else to say.  In that case, youll have to pay full list price, sorry.   Can you at least to a few test shots today? So I can show them Im serious? Lisa asked.   Sure, but you need to clean up your crotch, I can Photoshop a lot of stuff, but not a patch of hair like that.  And Ill have to call in Cathy.   I can do my own makeup and hair, do you have a station set up here?  In the back, the photographer said.  Light switch is on the right.   Lisa stepped in the back and turned on the light, Toby scampered up on a stool next to her.  She turned on the makeup table light and looked at what she had to work with.  First she needed a razor, there was none.  Frustrated she called out, Where can I get a razor?  The photographer came around the corner and said, Theres a drugstore three stores down.   Lisa looked to Toby, Can you go buy me a razor? she asked.   Nobodys going to sell a razor to a beaver, plus these doors are too hard for me to open.  And, she only gave you enough money to buy a hair thingy.   Frustrated, Lisa laid her head down on the makeup table and began to sob.  All she ever wanted was to model and she couldnt even get a razor to shave her hairy snatch.  I give up, she said and stood up.  Lets go, she said and walked back into the main lobby.   Where are you going? the photographer asked.   I got to buy that fucking head thing, she only gave me ten bucks, I cant do the shoot, Im sorry, she said with a tear in her eye.   You have plenty of time, just come back when you have the money, shes paying you to be a maid right?  Lisa nodded yes.   When you get paid, come back shaved and ready to shoot, Ill still be here, Ive been here in this location for twelve years and I dont plan on leaving anytime soon.   Alright, Lisa said and headed to the door.  She looked down at Toby and said, Lets go, we have to buy that stupid fucking head band.   Lisa and Toby left the photo shop and headed down the sidewalk looking at the stores as she went along.  She was supposed to stop at the lingerie store to buy the headband.  Then she saw something else, a sex store, the kind that sold dirty movies and sex toys.   What are you looking at? Toby asked.   Look over there, at that store, I want to go in and look around, Lisa said.   No, we dont have enough money to be buying any shit today, lets get the headband and go back.   I dont start work till tomorrow, I have time, Lisa said and walked across the street to the sex store.  On the outside were large pictures of half-naked women all seeming to be in mid orgasm.  They were wearing more than she was.  Lisa let Toby in first and they entered the store like a kid in a candy shop.  Lisa expected the place to be filled with horny men looking to get off on sex magazines for free, what she saw was two women at the dildo rack having a conversation and another woman looking at a corset.   This is awesome, she said.   Might as well be a hardware store to me, lets go back, I need to sharpen the lawn mower blades, Toby said.   Lisa walked over to the lube section and picked up a bottle.  Warms as you touch, she read.  Cherry flavor.  She spied another bottle that said chocolate and a different brand that had a spray tip.   What are those? Toby asked.   Says flavored lubricant, Lisa replied.   Why would anyone need to flavor lube?  Some women dont clean well, they taste bad, Lisa replied.   Wouldnt it be cheaper to take a shower than buy this shit?  Lisa put down the lube and walked over to a wall with various sex toys hanging from pegs.  One was a rubber ass with a realistic pussy.  Package said, twenty pounds of real feel.  Next to that on a pedestal was a computer display playing a demo loop on a masturbation toy.  Over and over it explained how you warmed it up, put in your cock, fucked it and cleaned it.  It was almost surreal, like they were doing a cooking show.   Lisa picked up a purple dildo and put it to her nose and sniffed it, almost to see if it was a used return.  It wasnt, it had the fresh smell of rubber.  Then a nerdy female clerk stepped up and asked, Is there anything I can help you with?  Lisa was taken by surprise by the clerk.  She was also surprised someone who looked like her worked in a place like this.   Oh, Im just window shopping for now, Lisa said.   That dildo you have there, I have three of them, I use one in the morning, and one at bedtime, the other I keep as a spare.  They feel so great and make me cum so hard.   Hearing those words come out of this womans mouth was like listening to a frumpy librarian read from a porn magazine.   Really, tell me more, Lisa said.   Toby crossed his little beaver arms in frustration realizing he wasnt going anywhere soon.        31   Douche      Lisa walked over to the two women looking at dildos hanging from plastic bubble packs on the wall.  Neither woman was really attractive, both looked to be in their late forties and were having a great time.   Hey, can I join in? Lisa asked.   One of the women, taller, bigger tits, looked at Lisas naked body and smiled.  Do you work here? she asked.   No, Ive never been in a store like this and I didnt want to shop all by myself, my beaver is being an ass right now.   Your beaver is an ass? the tall woman asked.   Oh, you think Im talking about my coochie, no, I mean Toby, and hes over against the wall pouting.  He wants to leave.   Oh, I didnt think they let pets in here, the short woman said.   Hes not a pet, hes his own beaver, Lisa replied.  What are you girls looking at?  The tall woman pointed at a twelve inch black dildo large enough for an elephant.  Im thinking about getting that one, she said.   Lisa leaned in close and looked at the price, One hundred twenty five dollars? she asked in amazement.  Does it vibrate?  No, its four pounds of latex rubber, the tall woman said.   Its as round as my arm, bigger, how would you fit that inside? Lisa asked.   Lube, she replied.   Yeah, but still, youd have to be bored out pretty wide.   This isnt my first time honey, Ive been riding these things since I was in high school.  I didnt get this wide overnight.   Dont get mad, but why not get a guy? I bet there are lots of men that would love to give you the real thing for free.   I dont want the real thing, I attach this to my stuffed camel and put it on my treadmill and let it fuck me.   Lisa tried to imagine that in her head.  How do you do that? she asked.   The woman pulled out her phone and pulled up a picture of the camel with a smaller dildo attached on a treadmill.   I see, Lisa said.   Only thing is that a dildo that size is hard to attach and keep on.  It weighs like four pounds, tape wont hold it on and if you try to put screws in it, it rips apart, the tall woman said.   You might have to forget the camel this time, the short woman said.  Just use the suction cup and attach it to the floor.   I tried that once with a dildo half this size, my floors arent smooth and the suction cups keep popping off.  I end up on my ass with half a rubber dick hanging out of me.   The short woman pulled another dildo down from the display.  This one has pipe threads so you can attach it to your plumbing it says.   Im not going to call a plumber to install a pipe to mount my new dildo, the tall woman said.   Then I dont know what youre going to do, youre shit out of luck.   Then the clerk came up from behind and spoke up, We do have a special collection in the basement if youd like to look ladies.   Sure the short woman said.   Follow me, the clerk said and the three women followed her to the back and down a set of stairs to a special room.  All around were very expensive looking sex dolls and rubber body parts.  Take a look over here, the clerk said pointing to a box on the floor.  You may have seen something like this online, but this product is brand new.  Its like a hobby horse with a fourteen inch dildo that comes up from inside this box and fucks you while you ride it.   Does it vibrate too? the tall woman asked.   Yes, this product vibrates and penetrates in and out for maximum pleasure.  At the press of a button, it shoots out warm artificial blow that will drip out later.  Just like in real life.   Hey, that reminds me, do you have anything I can use to keep from dripping on the bed after sex? the short woman asked.   Yes, its called a towel, the clerk replied.   I was hoping for something more sophisticated, she said.   Nope, a towel is the best product for wiping the splooge out of your crack, the clerk replied.   Lisa chimed in, Can we try this out? she asked.   Certainly, the clerk said, First you must douche so you dont contaminate the latex phallus, then you may mount the box and try it out.   Do you have a douche? Lisa asked.   No, this isnt a pharmacy, its a sex store.   Frustrated, Lisa tried to mount the dildo anyway and was shoved onto the floor by the clerk.  She hit her head on a box full of gay porn DVDs.   I said no touchy, the clerk said.  Now you can buy this or get the fuck out.   How much is this thing? Lisa asked.   Seven hundred and fifty dollars, the clerk replied.   Holy shit, thats outrageous! Lisa snapped back.   Its not for everyone, obviously not for you, the clerk said like a bitch.   Yeah, well you can take your rubber dicks and shove them where the sun dont shine, Lisa said.  Then she realized that is where they shove them.   Look, the clerk said.  I dont want to get off on a bad foot here so I will let you have a free sample of a new product that just came in.   What is it, the short woman said with excitement.   Its a new disposable dildo, you insert it like in the bathroom at work, and it fucks you for about twenty minutes and dissolves.   That dont sound right, you mean like Alka Seltzer?  No, it doesnt fizz and bubble, it turns into a jelly substance and drools out your pussy, you have to wear a large maxi pad when you are using one of these.   Can I see it, the tall woman asked.   The clerk dug into a box and pulled out three demo models and handed them to each woman.  They felt like marshmallows.   This isnt hard enough to get in me, the tall woman said.   The clerk replied, What you do is roll it in a ball, stick in on the outside of your vagina hole and poke it until its all inside.  Once it gets warm, it goes into action.  Kind of like Mexican jumping beans.   You expect me to believe that? the tall woman asked.  Its probably made in Mexico and toxic.  Ive never heard of such a thing.   The clerk shook her head.  I use one every day after lunch.  I shove it in like a Tampax, it fucks me for a while and then it runs down my leg.  I dont wear pads.   Is that what I see running down your leg now? Lisa asked pointing to the jelly on the clerks leg.   Yeah, thats it, the clerk replied.   Why dont you wipe it off?  I got panty hose on, it gets stuck in the fibers.   Lisa rolled hers into a ball and was about to shove it in her vagina when the short woman interrupted her.  What are you doing? That thing isnt safe.   She uses it every day, Lisa said referring to the clerk.   Dont do it, something about it doesnt seem right.   Lisa leaned back upright and held the soft dildo in her hand.  Then she saw it move on its own.  She was warm enough now to get it to do its job when inserted.  It felt like a bug in her hand and she dropped it on the floor and stomped on it till it flattened out and the moving parts stopped.   What makes it move? Lisa asked.  Is there worms in there?  The clerk, now frustrated, shook her head and told the women they had to go back upstairs.  If you dont want the free gift put it back, but I need for you to leave unless youre making a purchase.   The short woman reached out and touched the fourteen inch dildo sticking out of the box.  Let me call my husband and see if I can have the money, she said.   You want this? Lisa asked.  What if it breaks down? Is there a warranty? Do they do repairs?  All our products have a ninety day warranty, dont worry about it, the clerk said.  Let me know what your husband says, but for now you three have to go back upstairs.  Lisa and the other two women found their way back to the staircase and headed back upstairs to the main floor.  Once there they headed back to the wall of dildos and continued to converse about which ones they wanted to buy.  Lisa was more pissed now than ever.  She didnt have money for the photo shoot or for a dildo, all she had to look forward to was fucking her fat ugly boss every day.        32   911      Frustrated, Lisa and Toby left the sex store and headed to the lingerie shop to buy the headband he boss wanted her to get, upon entering the store, Lisa took notice of all the sexy corsets and wall of shoes that seemed to go on forever.  She magnated to the nightgowns and sifted through the racks of teddys in blacks, blues and reds.  Then a clerk approached her.  May I help you? the woman asked.  She was dressed in a t-shirt that read, Dont fuck with momma, a pair of see through yoga pants and a pair of flats.  She was also very pregnant.   Yes, Im looking for a head band to go with my work uniform, it has to have a black strap across the top and white frilly lace on the edges.   Like a French maid? the clerk asked.   Yeah, I suppose that would work, Lisa replied.   We sell those, but only as part of a set, you have to get the corset, the garter and the heels as well.   Really? Lisa asked disappointed.  How much is that going to cost?  The clerk walked Lisa over to the French maid set and checked the price tag.  Seventy five dollars, she said.   My boss gave me enough for a head band, this sucks, Lisa said.   Sorry, dont know what to tell you.   Ill have to get one online, Lisa said.   Toby decided to chime in, Yeah, fuck this place, if they cant stock what you need, get it on the internet.  he said with a shit eating grin trying to piss off the clerk.   Dont make me no difference, the clerk said.   You dont care that youre not making a sale? Toby asked.   No, and how did a giant rat get in here?  What a pathetic fuck, Toby said.  What does your boss think about your attitude?  She comes in here twice a month, fuck, I dont think I know her name, the clerk said.   I could do your job, Toby said.  And ten times better.  You know nothing about customer service.  Id never let a customer leave without getting them what they needed.   I told you, the head band only comes with the set.   So go in the back, call your supplier and order this girl a head band you stupid cunt, Toby said.   Nobody calls me a cunt! the clerk said holding her belly.  She rocked back and forth and closed her eyes for a second making faces like she was constipated.   Whats wrong? Lisa asked.   Its the baby, Im due anytime now, the clerk replied.   Is there someone you can call to watch the store? You need to get to the hospital, Lisa said.   No, the other two girls that work here are on vacation, Im it, the clerk said.   Are you having contractions? Lisa asked.   Could be.   You better close up the shop and head to the hospital, is there someone you can call to take you?  My boyfriend is in jail, Ill have to call a cab.   Lisa began to panic thinking this woman was going to have her baby right here on the floor.  Ill call 911, Lisa said and held out her hand.   What do you want? the clerk asked.   Your phone.   Its under the counter, by the register, the clerk said.   Lisa ran over and found her phone, she called 911 and came back to the clerk what was now buckled over in pain.  Then she saw a puddle of clear fluid on the floor dripping down the clerks legs.  Your water broke, Lisa said.  You need to lie down.   Oh no, not now! the clerk said.   Lisa helped the clerk get to the floor and lie on her back.  The clerk laid there in pain holding her belly making whining noises.   Is there anything I can do? Lisa asked.   Toby spoke up, She needs an epidural.   What? Lisa asked.   That procedure where they put pain medications in her spine.   Thats great Toby, Lisa said.  Does it look like I have one here?  No, Im just saying.   Why dont you go to the front door and wait for the ambulance?  You mean like on that show from the seventies, Emergency? With Randolph Mantooth and that Kevin somebody? I loved that show.   You live in the woods, how did you ever see that show? Lisa asked.   It used to play in the dorm when I was at community college.  Came on every day at ten, Toby replied.   Lisa looked at Toby like he was stupid, then after a long awkward pause, she asked him to go to the door and wait.  Then she turned her attention back to the clerk lying on her back on the cold floor.  How are you doing? she asked.   Its coming, I can feel it move, the clerk said.   Dont push, whatever you do, dont push.  I cant have a baby coming out right now, Im not qualified to deliver a baby.   Toby yelled from the door, Theyre here! and ran back to Lisa.  The sounds of sirens got louder and louder until the ambulance stopped at the front door and parked.  Then they turned off the sirens but kept the lights flashing.  In a moment or two, the ambulance crew rushed inside and ran to the pregnant woman lying on the floor.   Shes about to blow! Lisa said.   The woman yelled, its coming! and started tugging on her yoga pants trying to pull them off.   One of the ambulance crew grabbed a pocket knife and cut the skin tight yoga pants, ever careful not to cut the woman, removing them so they could get to her vagina.  Once the pants were removed, they were discarded to the side.  Toby picked them up and tried to shove them in his pocket, then he realized he didnt have a pocket, he just wanted to keep them for some reason.   One of the ambulance crew got on the radio and called the hospital, he got a message back and shoved a finger in the womans vagina, and he pulled it back out and reported something to the person on the other end.  Get the gurney! the crewman said.  We still have time.   What are they doing sticking their finger in a pregnant woman? Toby whispered to Lisa.   Seeing how far shes dilated, Lisa replied.   I think thats very inappropriate considering shes pregnant.   What? Lisa asked.   Cant they find someone not pregnant to finger? Toby asked.   Theyre not fingering her, theyre checking to see how far along she is.   She looks pretty far along to me, look how fat she is, Toby said.   You are so fucking stupid, no wonder you didnt finish college, Lisa said.   In a flash, the crew had the woman strapped on the gurney and out the door into the waiting ambulance leaving Lisa and Toby behind alone.   Do you want to clean up this puddle on the floor or should I do it? Toby asked.  I think its a trip hazard.   Do you see any cameras Lisa asked looking around the ceiling.   Why? You planning on stealing something?  Maybe, Lisa said running behind the counter.  She scanned for a monitor and found one, then she saw the button on the recorder that said play, and stop She pressed stop and then turned the unit off to make sure it wasnt recording anything.  There she said and came back around to the front.   What did you just do? Toby asked.   I shut off the camera, Lisa replied.  Now Im going shopping.  Lisa quickly dashed from rack to rack pulling off anything she liked that looked like it might fit her.  She placed the outfits over her arm and ran to the wall of shoes and picked out three pair.  Grab me a sack from behind the counter, she said to Toby.  Toby grudgingly obeyed and got her a sack and helped her place the clothes and shoes inside.  Then they heard a ding from the door and both turned to see a tall, lanky, sexy blonde walk in the door with beautiful eyes and a huge rack of tits.   Fuck, Lisa said under her breath, her plan was screwed.   The woman walked over to Lisa and looked at her naked body.  She seemed to be judging her and by her expression wasnt too impressed.  Hi, she said.  Im looking for a thong, can you point me in the right direction?  It was now obvious this woman thought Lisa was a clerk so she decided to play along.  Over there by the nightgowns, Lisa said pointing.   The woman stepped over to where Lisa was pointing, rocking her tight ass back and forth with each step.  In her skin tight jeans, she looked like a lollypop in heels.   Lisa gave Toby the look that said, Lets get the fuck out of here, and they both took off to the front door.  Then a loud buzzer went off and Lisa realized the clothes she was stealing was tagged and she was busted.  In a panic, she dropped the clothes on the floor and ran out the front door followed by Toby who scampered up beside her.  In a full adrenaline buzz, Lisa power walked as fast as she could back towards home, past the sex shop and the photography studio.  All she could do is hope nobody saw what happened and could get home and hide.  Then she heard a car pull up behind her and a woman call out.  Miss, miss? the woman asked.  Lisa turned and saw it was the same woman from the store she had just spoken too.   What? Lisa asked.   The woman held out a bag, the same bag Lisa dropped on the floor before she left.  You forgot your bag, she said.   Lisa stopped and approached her car, Thanks but I left those on purpose, I changed my mind.   Oh, I thought these were from a different store that you brought in, so these arent paid for? the woman asked.   No, I just didnt have time to put them back, I forgot I had an appointment.   The woman paused for a moment to think and then said, I guess I could take them back, dont you work there? she asked.   No, Im a maid, Lisa replied.   A maid? I work in housekeeping at the hotel across the street.  Funny though, we have to wear clothes, are you working now?  Sort of, my boss sent me to pick up a head band, they only sell them in sets with the clothes so now I have to order one online.   What kind of headband? the woman asked.   Like what a French maid would wear, Lisa replied.   I have one from a Halloween costume you can have, the woman said.   Does it look cheesy? Lisa asked.   I thought it looked good, it was an expensive costume.   Ok, when can I get it? Lisa asked.   I can take you to my place and get it if you want, I only live a mile from here.   Can I bring my beaver? Lisa asked.   The woman looked at Lisas pussy and smiled, Sure, you can bring whatever you want.   She means me, Toby said looking up into the window.   The woman looked down at Toby and said, Is that your pet?  No, I get so tired of explaining this, Lisa said.  Hes my friend.   Does he shed? I dont want fur all over my car.   I shed a little, Toby said, Dont worry about it, Ill clean up after myself.   The woman looked at Toby and admired his cute little eyes.  Alright, you can sit in the back.   Lisa got in the passengers side and Toby scrambled into the back.  The woman took off and drove through the mall to the exit and got onto the highway heading towards her place.  Thanks for doing this, Lisa said.   No problem, Im sure Ill never wear that outfit again, it was my old bosss idea, and I dont work for that prick anymore.   What did you do before you worked at the hotel? Lisa asked.   I was an executive assistant for a housing developer, basically I sucked dick all day, the woman said.        33   REO Speedwagon      Back at her apartment complex, the woman led Lisa and Toby up the sidewalk to the front door.  What is your name? Lisa asked.   Wendy, Wendy said.   Wendy, whats up with that creepy guy mowing the lawn? Lisa asked.  He keeps staring at us.   Wendy looked over at the man making all the noise riding the riding lawnmower cutting the apartment grass.  Thats Sid, the apartment manager, fucking creep is right.  Real perv.  The three entered the apartment complex and took the elevator to the third floor where Wendy lived.  Once inside her apartment, she looked in her closet for the head band for Lisa.   What do you mean by perv? Lisa asked.   Well, for one thing, every time I try to sunbathe in the back, he seems to need to mow the lawn, I think he thinks its a free show.   Do you wear a bikini? Lisa asked.   At first, but I don't want tan lines so I do take it off eventually, Wendy replied.  Once he even came over and offered to put lotion on me.  Stood there for like ten minutes bothering me.  I finally told him to leave me alone.   Can you go on the roof? Or find another place to lay out?  Bored with these two ladies, Toby decided to speak up.  I can take him out for you if you want.   Take him out? Wendy asked.   Yeah, Ill teach that fucker a lesson hell never forget.   And Ill get kicked out of my apartment, no thanks, this place is pretty nice for the price.   He wont know you said a word, trust me, I can take care of fucks like him.   Then on the television Lisa saw a picture of someone she recognized, it was Madame Jane, the woman who chopped off Tobys tail and let her back to Sparksville.  The sound was turned down so she ran over to the television and turned it up.   Today Madame Jane declared it Taco Tuesday in all of Lancaster, the reporter said.  It wasnt an ad for a taco restaurant, it was a news story.   What the fuck? Lisa asked.  How can she declare anything?  Youre not from around here? Wendy asked.   No, but I did visit once, I met Madame Jane once, she sent me home when I needed to get away from here.   Wendy looked at Toby and put two and two together, Hes a talking beaver isnt he? she asked rhetorically.   Yeah, Lisa said.   That explains that, but then you still have your tail.   Toby picked up his tail and petted it, Got it back is what you mean, he said.   Explain, Wendy said.   That bitch Madame Jane cut off my tail and made soup out of me, its a long story but I came back, Toby said.   Well, Wendy said.  Thanks you to you and your beaver, Madame Jane now has all supreme power.  That beaver tail was used in a spell and now we are all under her control.  If she says its Taco Tuesday, I guarantee you there will be a line of cars down at Taco Bell five miles long.   Oh, sorry, Lisa said.  I didnt think she was serious, she said lying to Wendy.   Maybe we should take your talking beaver to a different witch and get her powers reversed? Wendy asked looking at Toby.   Sorry, nobodys making me into soup twice.   Do you know what its like living with some megalomaniac bitch with unlimited power? She proclaims all sorts of shit and we have to comply.  Do you know what its like to have Dress like a cave person day? Or dress like the fifties day? Its like shes having her own personal office party but everyone else has to comply.   What happens if you dont do what she says? Lisa asked.   She has her ways, I dont know how, but she finds out and fucks with you.  I know a lady at the hotel I work at that didnt go to see Reo Speedwagon on Reo Speedwagon day when they played at the mall, and. . .  I cant talk about it.   There is no way this whole town could show up to the mall, there has to be thirty thousand people living here, Toby said.   Yep, and youve never heard so many people sing along to Cant fight this feeling in your life.   Wait a second, I saw Reo Speedwagon in Sparksville ten years ago, how did they get to Lancaster? Theres only one way I know and I doubt they took the death tube to the swimming pool, Toby said.   I dont know, maybe this ones a tribute band, I dont go for eighties rock, Wendy said.   Then there was a knock on the door.  Fuck, Wendy said and opened it finding Sid on the other side wearing only a pair of short shorts, no shirt or shoes and he was covered in sweat.   Im here to fix your kitchen faucet, Sid said.   I called you on that three months ago, why are you here now? Wendy asked.   Sid looked over at Lisas naked body and swallowed hard.  I just got time, Sid replied.   It takes you two days to mow the lawn, how do you all of a sudden have time to fix my faucet?  Sid tried to step into the apartment but Wendy blocked his way.   Do you want it fixed or not?  Wendy backed up.  Where are your tools? she asked.   By now, Sid had a raging hard on and his pants were starting to bulge.  Lisa took notice and backed up to the couch.   Im here to look for now, Ill bring my tools later, he said keeping his eyes on Lisas tits.  Who is your friend here? he asked.  Is she moving in?  No, shes here to pick up a headband, now look at the sink and get out.   Sid saw Toby sitting on the couch picking his toenails.  You know there are no pets allowed, that violates your lease.   Hes not my pet, hes a friend of hers, as soon as she gets the headband, and the rat will go.   Im a beaver, Toby said examining the stuff he picked out of his foot.   Sid stepped over and took a long look at Lisa.  You single? he asked.   No, Im married, have four kids, my husbands a cop, and a lawyer, Lisa replied lying her ass off.   Too bad, Sid said licking his lips.   If you dont mind, you can stop examining me now, Lisa said.   Fine, Ill be back later with my tool box, will you be here? Sid asked Lisa.   No, I wont Lisa replied.   Sid turned and walked back to the doorway past Lisa.  Im going to finish the lawn first, make a clean space for you to get a tan, he said and left pulling the door closed behind him.   Sorry about that, Wendy said.  One of these days hes going to go too far and Ill be able to call the cops.   Arent you afraid hell use his pass key, come in here and rape you? Lisa asked.   No, I got a gun hidden in every room, loaded and ready to shoot.  If he tries anything, hes a dead man.   You shouldnt have to go to all that trouble, why not report him to the owner?  I did once, and now my toilet backs up constantly.   You think he had something to do with that?  I cant prove it, but why all of a sudden would that start happening?  Toby spoke up, You taking bigger shits?  No! Wendy snapped back.  Be nice or Ill make you wait outside.   Maybe we should go now, Lisa said feeling bad.   Give me a second, Ill get that head band for you, Wendy said.  She got back into the closet and found what she was looking for.  There you go, she said handing the headband to Lisa.  Now Ill take you two home.  But first we have to stop for tacos  I got a little cash, Lisa said.  I dont get paid till next week, I just started my new job.   You can get a taco for ninety nine cents that will ward off her evil spell Wendy said.   But I dont want to wait at drive through all day, how long will it take to get my food?  A couple of hours, but not getting it would be worse, take my word for it and come with me.       Two hours later and Wendy, Lisa and Toby are still parked in a line at Taco Bell that goes on for a half mile.   This is fucking ridiculous, Toby said, Im getting out and walking home.   Youll regret it, Wendy said tapping her finger on the steering wheel.   Im regretting ever coming back to Lancaster, Toby said.  If you want to come with me, do it now, he said to Lisa.   Lisa was bored to death and didnt want to wait in line any longer.  She didnt want the wrath of Madame Jane either, but she wasnt around and it was hot inside and outside the car.  Im going, Lisa said.   Dont say I didnt warn you, Wendy said.   Lisa got out of the car and caught up to Toby who was heading back to home.  Or at least the place they were staying while they worked.  I dont think I like it here, she said.   The grass is never greener on the other side, Toby said.   Yeah, but if you dont try, you never know.   True, what do you think will happen to us if we dont get a taco? Lisa asked.   Maybe our boss is having tacos tonight, if they had the television on, the cook would have made them.   Hey, youre right! Lisa said, now her mood improved.  We better get back fast, supper should be in about an hour.   We have a few miles to walk, lets pick up the pace, Toby said.   We can walk five miles in an hour silly, we dont have to run.   Yeah, but Im lost, do you know which way it is back home?  Lisa looked around, they hadnt been in this part of Lancaster before and the strip mall they were shopping at was nowhere in sight.  We might have to ask for directions, she said.   Do you know the address of where we live?  No, do you? she asked.   Fuck no, Toby replied.  I dont even remember their last names.   Its Theresa and Henry something, Lisa said.  I think its Snow.   Anyway, we need to find the house, I have a feeling if we dont eat tacos today, and well be fucked.       Toby and Lisa walked quickly trying to find landmarks that would lead them home.  Cars were parked in the streets in line for tacos blocking their view and they became more and more confused.  Finally Toby decided to ask someone what would happen if they didnt eat a taco today.  He approached a passenger in car with a family inside.  Hey, Toby said getting a young man's attention.  He rolled down his window and said, What can I do for you?  Im not from around here, whats the big deal with the lines to Taco Bell?  You have till midnight to eat a taco or you're fucked, the man said.   Can you be more specific? Fucked is sort of a general term, Toby asked.   Its different for everyone, I cant tell you what would happen to you.  You might lose your fur, or get mad beaver disease, who knows?  I know a guy that had mad beaver disease, he ran around all day beating his head on trees foaming at the mouth, Toby said.  It was horrible.   We better get back to Taco Bell then, Lisa said.   You wont have time, by the time you get back in line it will be too late, the man said.   What about Wendy? Shes still in line? Toby said.   Yeah, but where? Now Im more lost than ever, and we wont make it home or to Taco Bell in time, were fucked!  We have to try, maybe we can go to a grocery store and make our own tacos from scratch, Toby said.   Good luck with that, every store in town is sold out by now, the man said.  May God have mercy on your soul.        34   Tale of the tail      Ten till midnight and Lisa and Toby are still lost, they decided to follow the line of cars to the Taco Bell and see if they could get help, what the found was another line of people standing outside waiting to get in, a line of police cars and a news crew doing interviews across the street.  Toby decided it would be a good idea to talk to one of the news crew and see what was really going on, he and Lisa crossed the street and approached a man sitting in a folding chair with a clipboard in his hand.   Excuse me, Toby said.  Whats with all the police and reporters and shit?  Are you kidding me? the man asked.  The shits about to hit the fan and you act like you dont know whats going on?  Who are you? Toby asked.   Im the field producer, who are you?  My name is Toby, this is Lisa, and were not from around here.   You must have come from a long way away, everyone knows what will happen at midnight, the producer replied.   What? I heard that today is taco Tuesday and that if I dont eat a taco by midnight something will happen, but nobody said what.   Nobody knows for sure, Madame Jane hasnt said anything, but if its like the REO Speedwagon fiasco, you dont want to know.   What do you mean? Toby asked.   Everyone who failed to show up to the REO Concert got diarrhea for a week.  She put a spell on them, filled the hospitals, people missed work and overall was disgusting, the producer said.   Whats this bitchs problem? Toby asked.   Shes power mad, she pulls these stunts just to keep us in line.   So no taco and I have the shits for a week? I once ate a taco in Tijuana and it gave me the shits for a week, ironic.   Yeah, and from the looks of that line, there are going to be a lot of people who wont make the deadline.  I think that store has had five semis unload today.   How much time till midnight? Toby asked.   The producer looked at his watch, About ninety seconds, he replied.   Do you have a cigarette? Toby asked.   No, but Jenny might, shes on camera right now to see what will happen at midnight.  If you still have lungs after then, shell bum you one.   Lisa sat on the grass and rested her head in her palms.  She had nowhere to go and this place was as good as any other.   Toby waited patiently as the time ticked down to midnight, and when the clock hit twelve he heard Lisa yell out, Ouch! and saw her stand up and look at her backside.  When she turned around she was sporting at two foot long tail.   What the fuck? she asked swinging her new appendage around.   Toby took a look and was horrified to see this skin tube swinging behind Lisa.  You got a tail, Toby said pointing at it as it flailed around.   I know, and its disgusting, Lisa said.   So thats it? Everyone who didnt eat a taco today now has a tail? Toby asked.   Then the sound of horrified voices filled the air as the people waiting in line and the people in their cars now realized that they now had tails.  The reporter, who was still live on the air perked up and dragged the camera operator across the street so she could do an interview with one of the victims.   What did it do to you? Lisa asked Toby.   Toby spun around and looked at himself from all directions, he didnt notice any change at all.  Must only be for humans, Toby said.  Beavers dont usually watch television or eat tacos, more of a twig and bark eater.   This is not fair! Lisa snapped.  I couldnt have got to the taco place in time if I wanted, she did this on purpose just to fuck with people.  Where does this bitch live? Im going to kick her ass! Lisa yelled.   She lives downtown, upstairs from the gas company, the producer said.   What? Someone with all that power and she doesnt live in some creepy castle or huge mansion? Lisa asked.   No, just a regular apartment.   Can you point me in the right direction? I have some words for her, Lisa said.   The producer wrote down the directions on some paper and gave it to Lisa, she and Toby then took off walking downtown to Madame Janes apartment.  She had no idea if shed get to see her, but she wasnt going to live with a tail for long.       An hour later, Lisa and Toby arrived at the building where Madame Jane lived, on the ground floor was the gas company, and off to the right was a door that led to a steep staircase to the upper floor.  There was a light on above the gas company, and no one around at all.   Where is everybody? Lisa asked.  Id guess more people than me would want to have a stern word with her.   Maybe shes not home, just because the lights on doesnt mean shes here, Toby replied.   Lisa opened the door and began the steep climb upstairs followed by Toby.  It was a tough one for such a little animal and he was winded when he got to the top.  Once they got to the top, there was a landing and a door to the left with a peephole.  Lisa knocked on the door and waited for a response.   It didnt take long till she heard the door click and open, they were met by Madame Jane herself.  She didnt recognize Lisa, but took notice of Toby right away standing by Lisas knee.   What are you and what do you want? Madame Jane asked.   Lisa, remember me? I gave up my talking beaver so you would send me home?  Yes, I do remember, and I see you found another beaver, does this one talk as well? Madame Jane asked.   Ask him yourself, Lisa replied pissed.   Why are you so angry?  Lisa spun around and showed Madame Jane her new tail.  I dont like this, I came to ask you to remove it.   Wait a minute, what are you doing back in Lancaster?  I thought things would be better here, I was wrong, dead wrong, now what will it take for you to take this tail off me?  Ill take the beaver, Madame Jane replied.   No, I made that mistake the last time, the beaver stays with me, what else will you take?  I dont need anything from you girl, I have supreme power, I could take the beaver if I wish.   Realizing she was fucked, Lisa needed a backup plan, she didnt have one.  So she decided to bluff.  Ill use his tail to gain supreme power and then Ill be running things, Lisa said.   Are you a witch?  I am now, I took classes when I went back to Sparksville the last time, Lisa replied.   Classes? Madame Jane asked giggling.  There are no classes that teach how to be a witch, its something handed down from mother to daughter.   No, they offer it at the community college, its a two credit hour class, Lisa said lying.   If thats so, show me your witchcraft, Madame Jane said.   Now really fucked, Lisa had to think fast.  Nothing came to her, nothing.  You cant tell me what to do, I will come back later and cast a spell on you that will make you wish you never met me, or put a tail on my ass!  Madame Jane shook her head and looked at Lisa like she knew she was a big fat liar.  Silly girl, you do that, go to the library, look up a spell or two and come back on your broom.  You might want to put some clothes on and cover up that hideous tail, makes you look like a kangaroo.   Fuck you, Lisa said and turned away.   Madame Jane chuckled and slammed the door leaving Lisa and Toby to descend down the steep staircase.  Fucking bitch, Lisa said being careful not to trip and roll down the stairs.   Youre not cutting off my tail, Toby said.  Im not going through that again.   No, I dont plan on cutting off your tail, but I dont plan on having one much longer just because that bitch thinks she can fuck with me and anybody else she wants.  Ill cut the fucker off myself if I have too.   The duo left the building and walked down the sidewalk in the dark.  They had no place to go, and still didnt know where home was.  Lisa needed a new plan and a place to stay, but where in Lancaster past midnight? Then they heard a voice call to them from a dark alley.  Lisa stopped and Toby bumped into her leg.   What? she asked.   Come here, the voice called from the dark.   Alright, Lisa said and headed into the dark alley.   What are you doing? Toby asked.  You dont know who that is!  You only live once, Lisa said as she sashayed into the darkness nude and with a tail.  Once she got used to the dark, she saw who, or what was talking to her.  It was a large rat holding a plastic bag filled with white powder.  What do you want? Lisa asked.   You want to buy some drugs? I got drugs, lots of drugs, the rat said.   What kind do you have? Lisa asked.   I smashed them all up and put them in a bag, its a mixed bag of drugs, the rat said.   Well, I dont feel sick, so I dont think I need any drugs, thank you, Lisa said.   No, these drugs dont make you feel better, no, I mean they do make you feel better, but they arent for sick people, the rat said.   Then Toby spoke up, Are you high? he asked the rat.   Maybe, I dont know, the rat replied.   We better get out of here, I dont like being in dark alleys at night, Toby said.   How much? Lisa asked.   Shocked, Toby blurted out, What the fuck? Why are you asking that?  Im curious, Lisa said.   The rat replied, Fifty bucks a cap full.   Cap full? What does that mean? Is that some sort of drug code? Toby asked.   No, a bottle cap full, the rat replied.   Can I try some first? Lisa asked.   Sure, but only a little, I cant give a lot away for free.   Lisa bent over and the rat opened the bag for her to put her finger inside, she took a pinch and put it on her tongue.  She made a face like she had just sucked a lemon, That tastes like iodine and vinegar.   You dont eat it you stupid bitch, you smoke it, or shoot it in your eyeball, the rat said.   I dont smoke, Lisa said, I want to be a model and smoking makes teeth turn yellow.   Then you got to shoot it up.   I dont have a needle, sorry, she said.  But thanks for the offer.   Wait, I got something else you might like, the rat said scurrying into a hole.  In a minute, he returned with a box and held it up to Lisa to see.   Whats this? Lisa asked.   Its a magic box, you can do all sorts of shit with it, the rat replied.   If its magic, why sell it to me? You could use it to get yourself out of this ally and quit selling dope to strangers.   Toby chimed in, What makes you think that box is magic? Ive seen magic boxes, Im sort of an expert.   The rat held the box closer to Toby so he could see it.  The box was plain cardboard, brown with a lid, no decoration.  Satisfied, Toby said, Nope, just a cardboard box, nothing magical about it at all.   Then the rat opened the lid and blue smoke rose out hovering above the box.  See, the rat said, Magic.   Looks like a trick to me, Toby said.  How much do you want for it? he asked.   If she wants it, one hundred dollars, I dont sell to livestock, the rat replied.        35   Magic Box      Well I dont have one hundred dollars, Lisa said.   What else you got sister? the rat asked.   I got a head band, and seventy five cents in change, she replied.   I could trick you out and take it in trade.   Trick me out? Im no prostitute, Im a model, Lisa said.   Whatever, you want the magic box, you fuck a few customers of mine, Ill take it out on trade.   You must think of me like a used car, and these friends of yours, are they rats like you?  No you stupid cunt, theyre people, just like you.  No rat would fuck your nasty stink hole.   Lisa shuffled and swung her tail back and forth.  How long would this take, I dont have all night.   Confused and shocked, Toby chimed in, What the hell are you doing girl? There is no way your fucking some stranger in a dark alley so you can get some stupid magic box thats probably fake.   Fake my ass! the rat said sticking his nose in Tobys face trying to provoke him.   Prove that box does more than blow blue smoke, Toby said.   I dont have to prove nothing to you, you freak of nature.   Me? Youre calling me a freak of nature? Who ever heard of a rat that could do math? Toby said.   I went to high school, the rat said.   Really? I was homeschooled and went to community college, Toby said.  I was in the top forty percent of my class.   Stay out of this buck tooth, Im dealing with the lady.   Shes a friend of mine, Ill look out for her if I want, now make some magic or were out of here.   Is that right? the rat said.  Well, Ill sell my magic box to someone with a little more faith, I dont need you chumps wasting my time, the rat said.   Faith? Really? Toby laughed.  Faith is you tricking out my friend to some dirtbag and then finding out your magic box is rigged with a smoke bomb you stole at a fireworks stand.   Lisa listened to both men argue and decided to speak up.  Im alright with it, she said.   With what? Toby asked.   Fucking some random stranger for the box, I have a good feeling about it.   Fucking some random stranger, Toby said under his breath.  I think that tail has done something to you, you never would have done this before.   No, probably not, but what do I have to lose? I have no home, no money and I think meeting this rat in this dark alley was fate.  I think I was meant to be here, right now to get that box.   Wait here, Ill go get someone for you to fuck, the rat said and then scurried back into a hole with the magic box.   How long should we wait? Toby asked.   Ill give him fifteen minutes, how many horny guys can there be past midnight?  Then they heard a noise from the far end of the alley as two men approached.  The closer they got, the more disgusting they looked.  Then they saw the rat scurry up and stop almost falling over itself.  I got two, theyre splitting you between them, the rat said.   Toby barked back, You didnt say nothing about two! She never agreed to two.   Its fifty bucks a fuck, it would have taken two anyway, sorry I didnt tell you, the rat said.   Its alright, Lisa said, I can take one in the mouth and the other in the rear.   You do butt sex? Toby asked.   I have, but I meant in my pussy, Ill get down on all fours and do them both at the same time, it will go faster.   Then the two gross men stepped up to Lisa and stopped.  Is this her? one of them asked.   Yeah, the rat said.   I want to go first, the man said.   Lisa popped in, Can you both go at the same time? I dont want to be here all night.   You only got one pussy, the man said.   I know, Ill have to give one of you a blow job instead.   The men looked at each other and nodded their heads in agreement.  Who gets the blow job? he asked.   Who wants it? she asked.   Both men raised their hands at the same time.   That wont work, I need one of you to fuck me in my pussy, who wants my pussy? Lisa asked.   Both men raised their hands at the same time.   This is going nowhere, Toby said.  They need to pick straws or something.   How about rock, paper, scissors, the winner gets to pick, Lisa said.   The men agreed.   Ready? One, two, three, rock, paper, scissors, she said and the man on the right won with rock beating scissors.   Alright, do you want pussy or a blow job? Lisa asked.   Ill take the blow job, he said.   Alright, Im going to get down on all fours, doggy style, you come up from behind, move my tail out of the way and fuck me, you get down in front so I can suck you off, she said.   Lisa got down on all fours and took both men in each hole.  It was like being on a see saw rocked back and forth while she sucked and was fucked.  In less than five minutes, both men blew their wads and pulled out.  Each one then paid the rat fifty dollars and left.   Lisa stood up and spit out the cum she had left in her mouth, and wiped off the dripping splooge from her leg with a dirty rag she found in a trashcan.  Can I have my magic box now? Lisa asked.   The rat took off into its hole and never came back out.   Pissed and frustrated, Toby said, I told you so.   Lisa stormed out of the alley back onto the sidewalk.  It was a very dark night except for the streetlights at the end of each block.  Son of a bitch! she said.  Why did I trust a rat? she asked rhetorically.   You both have tails, maybe you felt a kinship to them, Toby replied.   Lisa flicked her tail and caught it in her hand and looked at it.  Do you think this looks like a rat tail? Why couldnt I have got a pony tail?  It looks disgusting, Toby replied.  We need to find a way to reverse the spell and get rid of it.   We could have it I had that magic. . .   Stop it! I told you that thing was a scam, now shut up and listen to me for once! Toby yelled ripping Lisa apart.  The only way I can think of reversing that spell is to get Madame fuckwad to do it herself.  Problem is she dont think she needs too.  We seem to have a power hungry witch on our hands and I dont know how to stop her.   Should we go back up to her apartment? Lisa asked.   Not tonight, we need to come up with a plan first, Toby replied.   So what do we do now? Lisa asked.   I guess we find a dumpster and call it home for now.   Im not sleeping in or under any dumpster, you may be a rodent, Im not.   Then I suggest finding our way back to our employers house soon.  Id suggest a phone book, but nobody uses them anymore.   Then Lisa saw a cop car drive by, she waved and it pulled over.   Maam, you do realize public nudity is a misdemeanor the cop asked.   Lisa thought quick on her feet and came up with a convincing lie, Two guys in the alley attacked me and took my clothes, she said.  Im trying to get back to where I work, but Im new in town and Im lost.  She even managed to shed a tear.   Well need to get a report and investigate, the officer said.  This isnt what Lisa wanted to hear, she just wanted directions and be on her way, now shes stuck, involved in a false report.   Its not a big deal, I didnt get hurt, and can you just tell me how to get home? she asked.   Assault and attempted rape is a big deal maam, we take our jobs seriously, the officer said.   Im fine, really, I need to go home.   No, Ill need your statement and then take you to the hospital for an exam.   Now Lisa was fucked, all she wanted to do was go home and now she had to come up with a good lie and spend the rest of the night in the emergency room while some doctor checked her with a rape kit.  Tell you what, Im going to go back to the alley for a minute, I think I left my purse, She lied.   Get in the car maam, the officer said.  Ill take you to the hospital and call for backup to check the crime scene, the officer said.  Is that your rat? he asked looking at Toby.   Yes, hes my rat, Lisa replied feeling defeated.  She got in the back of the cruiser and closed the door.       At the hospital, Lisa was taken to an exam room and told to sit on an exam table.  A nurse took her vital signs and charted them on a computer.  Are you pregnant? the nurse asked.   No, Lisa replied.   Do you use birth control?  Yes.   What kind?  Depo.   Have you ever had any sexually transmitted diseases?  Yes.   What kind?  Vaginal warts, Lisa replied and the questions went on for ten minutes.   The doctor will be in to see you in a few minutes, the nurse said and closed the door.   Lisa sat on the exam table, very uncomfortable with her new tail.  Ten minutes went by then the door opened.   Miss Lisa Marie? the doctor asked.  He was of Middle Eastern descent.  You are here for a rape exam? the doctor asked.   Yes, but I dont need one, see, I had consensual sex with a guy I picked up at the bar today so whatever you find wont be accurate.   You pick up men in bars? the doctor asked.   Yes, whats it to you? she asked.   I find that behavior quite disturbing.   People do it all the time.   Yes, and I find that disturbing as well.  Let me see your vagina, he said.  Please put your feet in the stirrups.   This is not necessary, Lisa said.   I am mandated by the court to perform the procedure, sorry, if you dont comply, I will have you chemically sedated.   Frustrated, Lisa laid back and put her feet in the stirrups like she was told.  The doctor poked his finger inside her and pushed around.   I see lots of seminal fluid in your vagina, it looks fresh, and how long ago did you bang this guy from the bar?  Nine or ten, Lisa replied.   There is a lot of blow in here for two in the morning.  Either this guy had a lot of semen, or youre lying to me.   I have nothing to hide, now collect your samples or do whatever the fuck youre going to do so I can go home!  Ill need pictures, he said and picked up the phone.  X Ray, send up the portable CT scan, he said and hung up.        36   Three weeks later      Three weeks later, Lisa wakes up from a coma and is lying in a hospital bed with tubes and wires coming out from all over.  She is dazed and confused and sees the blurry image of a woman standing over her.   Miss Marie? Are you alright? the woman asked.   Groggy, Lisa replied, Yes, whats going on?  Let me get the doctor, the woman said and left the room.   As Lisa laid in the bed, she became more lucid and took in her surroundings.  She was in a hospital room with an impressive amount of electronic gear flashing and blinking all around her.  She saw she had an I. V.  in her hand and a tube running around her head giving her oxygen through her nose.  She had no clue how she ended up here.  Then a short skinny Asian man in a lab coat came in holding a clip board with a stethoscope hanging around his neck.  He stopped at the side of the bed and looked down at Lisa.   How are you feeling today? the man said, the name Dr.  Chang was embroidered on his coat.   I feel fine, whats going on? Lisa asked.   Just then two men wearing suits came in the room, each carrying a briefcase.   These men will explain everything, Dr.  Chang said.  He stepped back and checked the monitors while the other two men opened their cases and gathered papers.   Hello Miss Marie, the first man said, My name is Larry and this is my partner Frank, we are lawyers with the hospital.   What are lawyers doing in my room?  Were getting to that.  Three weeks ago you came to the E. R.  for a rape exam, it seems that the doctor working that night made a possible error and gave you an injection of a drug that you were either allergic to or highly sensitive to, we dont know.   Alright, so why are you here? Doesnt that sort of thing happen all the time?  Yes it does, and thats not the issue.   What is the issue? Lisa asked.   Once you had your reaction, you went into a coma and youve been here ever since, Larry said.   I still dont see why lawyers are involved.   Well, something happened while you were in the coma.   What? Lisa said with very open eyes.   One of our staff decided to lend you out as a cpr dummy and you sustained damages.   What kind of damages?  Three broken ribs and a bruised C4 vertebrae, Larry said.   Oh my fucking God! Lisa said.   Thats not all, Larry said.   What else did you fucking do to me?  Larry swallowed hard and tried to smile.  There was also a nursing class that used you to demonstrate several procedures to student nurses.  One was the insertion and removal of a Foley catheter.  Seems they didnt use good sterile procedure and you got a bladder infection, and then vaginitis.   Whats vaginitis? Lisa asked.   According to what the doctor sent me, its a bacterial or viral infection of the vagina.   And how the hell did that happen? Lisa asked.   Larry had a hard time looking at Lisa now.  Seems one of the students couldnt get the tip of the catheter into your urethra, so she lubed the tip by licking the end of the catheter and slid the end accidently into your vagina.  This student had strep throat and gave you an infection.  It was treated with a broad spectrum antibiotic and from what Dr.  Chang has told me, is pretty much cleared up.   Is that all? Lisa asked.   Yes, I think so, Larry replied.   So what are you doing here? Do you want me to sign my rights away?  Yes, but we are willing to offer you a settlement if you dont sue the hospital.   How much?  Twenty five hundred, Larry said.   Are you shitting me? Lisa asked.  Lets talk some real numbers, I want one point three million dollars, she said glaring at Larry.   Larry wrote down what Lisa said.  Ive been authorized to offer up to five thousand dollars, Larry said.   I dont fucking think so.   Thats all I have today, we will be in touch, Larry said.  The lawyers gathered up their papers and left the room.   Can you believe that? Lisa asked.  Dr.  Chang acted like he didnt hear her.   Hey, does this kind of shit happen a lot around here? Lisa asked.   Dr.  Chang walked to the bedside and said, I once left a whole box of gloves in a patient after a surgery, people are people, we make mistakes.   They used me as a demonstration dummy, who does that? Lisa asked.   Obviously our staff, Dr.  Chang said.   Then Lisa remembered Toby.  Wheres my beaver? she asked.   Thats still intact, we didnt remove that, Dr.  Chang replied.   No, I mean Toby.   You call your vagina Toby?  No, I mean my friend Toby, hes a beaver, and he was here when I came to the E. R.  three weeks ago.   I have no idea, we dont allow pets in the hospital.   Hes not a pet, hes my friend, Lisa snapped back.   Youll have to talk to the social worker, Im just a doctor, do you have any concerns I should know about before I go?  When do I get to leave? Lisa asked.   You can leave whenever you want, Dr.  Chang replied.   What about all these wires and crap?  Ill send a nurse in, youll have paperwork to sign at discharge.       Two hours later a tall blond woman entered the room.  She had perfect makeup, curves from top to bottom and tits that looked like two water balloons stuffed under her shirt.  Hi, Im Cindy, I hear you want to go home?  Yeah, Im sick of this place, Lisa said.   I see, let me take all these things off you and get you on your way.   Cindy, removed the I. V.  and the oxygen and pulled up Lisas gown.   What are you doing? Lisa asked.   Im doing your exit exam, for my charting.   Alright, Lisa said as Cindy ran her hands up and down all over her naked body.   Does any of this hurt? Cindy asked.   No, Lisa replied.   I need to check your vagina to see if the infection is cleared up, can you raise your knees and spread your legs?  Lisa did as asked and the woman placed her fingers inside Lisas vagina.  She then began to move her fingers in and out and stroke her clit with her thumb.   What are you doing? Lisa asked.  Is that proper procedure?  Cindy pulled her fingers out and smelled them, then tasted them.  I dont smell anything funny, I think youre all healed up.   Thats how you test for infections? Lisa asked.   I used to work in the lab, Cindy said.   What does that say on your name tag? Lisa asked.  The name tag was turned so it was difficult to read.   Cindy turned the name tag backwards so it couldnt be read.  It says Cindy Loo, Registered Nurse.   Let me read it, Lisa said.   I have to be going now, Cindy said.   Why all of a sudden?  My beeper is going off.   What beeper? I dont hear anything.   Bye, Cindy said and darted for the door.   Lisa hit her call button and waited for a response.  Then a young woman wearing scrubs came in the room.  What can I do for you? she asked.   Where did that nurse go that was just in here? Lisa asked.   What nurse? the woman asked.   Tall, blonde, big tits?  We have no nurses that look like that, the woman replied.   Then who just molested me? Lisa asked.   Oh, thats Cindy, the woman replied.   You know this woman?  Yeah, she works in housekeeping.   Housekeeping? Lisa asked pissed.  She just took off all my stuff and fingered me.   Yeah, she does that.   What kind of fucked up hospital is this? How does a housekeeper take off I. V. s and then molest a patient?  I dont know, I dont work here, the woman said.   You dont work here? Then what the fuck are you doing in my room? Lisa snapped back.   I just like the pretty flowers, the woman said and stood there like a freak.   Is there a psych ward near here? Lisa asked.   This is the psych ward, the woman replied.   What?  You are in the psych ward of the hospital, youre nuts.   No, Im not, Lisa said sliding her feet onto the floor.  Im also not staying here any longer.  Lisa stood up and took a step when she was stopped suddenly by a tug on her backside.  She turned around to see that she was tethered to the bed with a cord that came out her ass.  Whats this? she asked looking behind her.   Thats a butt plug restraint, they use that to keep you from leaving, the woman replied.   They shoved a butt plug in my ass? How was I taking a shit? Lisa asked.   I dont know, I dont work here, but I do like your pretty flowers, the woman replied.   How do I get this out?  It takes a key.   Where do I get a key?  Ill go get you a nurse, the woman said and turned to leave.   Wait! Dont go yet, I dont want anyone to know Im trying to leave.   Sure, but there isnt much I can do.   Let me think, is there any way you can get me something to pry this out with? Like a butter knife?  Oh, you dont want to do that, the more you try to pull it out, the bigger it gets.  It has a motor, the woman said.   Fucking great, Im tied to the bed with a butt plug restraint, in a psych ward and was used as a test dummy.   Who told you that? the woman asked.   Larry the lawyer and his partner, Lisa replied.   Oh, Larry isnt a lawyer, hes a patient here.  His partner is his brother Jimmy.  They think theyre lawyers, actually they were conjoined twins that were separated during a car accident.  The trauma of being physically separated fucked with their minds and now they live here.   How about Dr.  Chang, is he for real? Lisa asked.   No, hes a poop eater, the woman replied.   How about you? Are you for real?  Yeah, Im your doctor.        37   Window Licker      The fuck you are, Lisa said and yanked on the butt plug till it popped out leaving the restraint sitting on the bed.  She rubbed her ass under her tail and soothed the pain.  Just then she heard the sound of a familiar voice calling her name, it was Toby!  Im in here! Lisa yelled.   A few seconds later Toby appeared in the doorway, he walked inside and looked at Lisa.  Ive come to break you out!  How did you know they were keeping me here? Lisa asked.   I didnt, I overheard two guys outside talking about you.  They were wearing suits and had briefcases, looked like lawyers.   So they were real lawyers? Lisa asked the woman standing next to Toby.   Yes, but theyre still nuts, the woman replied.   Yeah, they were being loaded into a white van with bars on the windows, Toby said.  One of them was trying to lick the window so I wasnt exactly sure they were telling the truth about you, but after three weeks I was tired of waiting.   You waited for me? How nice, Lisa said.   Yeah, they made me leave the hospital so I slept on the bench outside.  I had to fight off the bums for a place to sleep, you know what thats like? Toby asked.   No, Im not a bum, she replied.   Anyway, I got a gun and Im breaking you out of this nut house, you ready?  What gun? I dont see a gun, Lisa said.   Id concealed, now lets go.   Lisa walked past the woman and followed Toby out into the hall.  For the most part it was quiet except for the occasional poop eater and head banger.   Watch out for the guys in white, they have the authority to kill, Toby said.  Most of them are ex-military, hired to keep this place in line.  Toby gestured for Lisa to duck down low as they both scurried down the hall.  Lisas hospital gown flopped in the breeze exposing her ass to the world.   How far is it? Lisa whispered.   We have to get down six floors, we may have to scale on the outside of the building.   How? Did you bring ropes and gear to do that? Lisa asked.   No, youll have to use your toenails, Toby said.   I dont think that will work, Im scared of heights, Lisa said.   Then well have to secure an elevator and leave that way.  Ever kill a man before? Toby asked.   No, why?  If they spot us trying to leave us, well have to use lethal force.  Toby said.   Isnt that a bit extreme?  Do you want to live with poop eaters and window lickers? Toby asked.   No.   Then get ready to kill if you have too, all you have to do is grab them by the jaw and snap their neck.   Why not use your gun? Lisa asked.   Too noisy, we have a long way to go and a short time to get there, Toby said.   Why are you reciting lines from Smokey and the Bandit?  Liked that movie, sorry, Toby said.  Now get rid of the gown, we need to be covert.   How is being naked covert? Lisa asked.   This is a nut house ward, they expect the residents to be naked.   Good point, Lisa said and she took off her gown and was naked again.  I wish I could get this tail removed, we are in a hospital.   No time for that now, see that elevator over there? Toby asked.  On my signal, we run for it.  Ready, go! he said and the two ran to the elevator.  Toby pressed the down button and they stood there waiting for the elevator to get to the sixth floor.  The lights lit up, the elevator made noise, but it took forever for the door to open.  More nervous than ever, Toby decided to scan the room for enemy combatants.  What he saw was a staff member standing by the television watching the screen and on the couch was a woman sniffing her hair.  Keep an eye on the woman, Toby said.  I dont trust her.   What about the staff guy? Lisa asked.   Hes busy watching television, he wont be a problem.   The door slid open and Lisa and Toby turned to get in, until they saw a lady with a food service cart.   You can come in, the woman said, There is plenty of room.   Toby and Lisa stepped onto the elevator and the door shut behind them.  Toby clicked the button for the ground floor.   What are you two up too? the nice lady asked making conversation.   We got lost looking for a friend, Toby said.  Got off on the wrong floor.   What section is your friend in? the woman asked.   Toby had to think on his feet, he didnt want to have to kill this poor old food service lady.  He has some sort of disease he picked up from a hooker he met last week, I think theyre doing some procedure to remove her shoe from his ass.   That would be general surgery, third floor, you just passed it, the woman said.   Now more nervous than ever, and caught in a lie, Toby jumped the old lady and grabbed her by the neck and snapped it.  She fell face first onto her table and collapsed onto the floor of the elevator.   Why did you do that? Lisa asked.   She was getting too nosey, I had to think fast, Toby replied.   You killed her for nothing.   Toby tried to kick her body behind the mobile food table but she was too heavy for his little beaver body.  When the door opens, make a run for the front door of the hospital.  If anyone tries to stop you, Ill put a bullet in their brain, got it? Toby asked.   The door opened with a ding and to their surprise, a full tactical team, decked out in black was waiting for them with guns pointed.   On the ground! was all Toby heard and down he went, face first arms and legs spread.  You too! the cop yelled at Lisa and she dropped to her knees.  A cop ran up and pushed Lisa down to the ground, placed a knee on her butt and cuffed her.  He then picked her up and hauled her down the lobby, out the door and into a waiting tactical vehicle.  Toby was right behind.       An hour later Lisa found herself being booked at the Lancaster law enforcement center.  She had a mug shots, and fingerprints recorded and was placed in an interview room alone and still naked.  Then the door opened and two officers walked in, one male, one female, both in polo shirts and slacks, each with a notepad and a badge.   Lisa looked at the male officer across the table she was sitting at and crossed her arms.  She was already anticipating a confrontation and was getting ready for battle.   Hello, the male said, My name is Detective Smith and this is my partner Detective Dombrowsky.  Were here to interview you about the murder of Madame Jane, but first I need to read you your rights.  You have the right to remain silent, everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law, and you have the right to an attorney, if you cant afford an attorney, one will be provided for you, and do you understand these rights as Ive explained them?  Madame Jane is dead? Lisa asked.   Yes or no, do you understand these rights?  Yes.   Where were you on the night of August third? Smith asked.   Lisa stared at Smith and thought hard.  She had no idea.  I have no idea, she replied.   Do you know, or associate with a beaver named Toby Amparo?  He has a last name? Lisa asked.   Is that a yes or a no?  I know a beaver named Toby, I dont know what his last name is, Lisa replied.  Why are you accusing me of killing Madame Jane? I had no idea she was dead.   Smith and Dombrowsky made notes on their pads.  What is the last memory you do have before being arrested?  Just waking up in the hospital, before that I was in the emergency room getting a rape check done.   When was that?  I dont keep a calendar, I dont have pockets, Lisa replied.   We did some checking and according to the hospital records, you were at the emergency room on September seventeenth, a full three weeks prior to waking up in the hospital.  Do you have any recollection of what transpired during those three weeks?  No, Lisa said.   Are you claiming amnesia? Smith asked.   Im not claiming anything, last I knew a doctor was shoving a Q tip up my crack and the next you guys are hauling me down the station for a murder I didnt commit.   The two detectives again wrote down notes in their notepads.   We know you killed Madame Jane, thats an undisputed fact, Dombrowsky stated.  Amparo ratted you out.   Please call him Toby, Amparo sounds funny, Lisa asked.   Fine, Toby turned you in, and we have video evidence to back his claim, as well as blood and fingerprint evidence.   Say what you want, Toby didnt say shit, Lisa said.   Hes not your friend, when the shit hits the fan, its everyone for themselves and he made a deal with the district attorney in exchange for his testimony.   Alright, humor me, what did he say I did?  He said you and him broke into Madame Janes apartment, threatened to kill her if she didnt remove your tail.  She refused, you attacked her with a kitchen knife and in the struggle, you stabbed her in the chest and she managed to toss you out the second story window.  She succumbed to her injuries and died at the scene twenty minutes later, Dombrowsky said.   Sorry, never happened, Lisa said.   We can show you the video of you entering the residence and of you falling out the window.  Do you want to see it?  No, I think this interview is over, Lisa said.   We have a few more questions for you, Smith chimed in.   What part of You have the right to remain silent dont you understand? Lisa asked.   Toby also said that you planned the murder in advance, is that true? Dombrowsky asked.   Even if that were true, what difference does that make?  The difference between life in prison and lethal injection, Smith replied.   Like I said, I have no memory of anything.  If I did, I wouldnt tell you anyway, what do you think I am? Stupid?  You did leave a lot of evidence at the scene, it was the work of an amateur.  Im not saying you're stupid, but a pair of gloves might have helped.   See, you answered your own question, if I had indeed committed this crime, and I planned it out in advance, I would have brought gloves, the fact that there are no gloves shows there was no planning.   Is that a confession? Dombrowsky asked.   No, Im playing your stupid game.  Punching holes in your ridiculous theory.  If I fell from the second story window, where are my injuries?  Detective Dombrowsky lifted a page from her notebook and pulled out a scan of an x ray and placed it on the table.  This is your X ray taken that night, you have three fractured ribs.   Lisa leaned over and took a look at the X ray, her name was on it as well as the name of the hospital.  She could clearly see the fractures in the ribs.   This is a fake, Lisa said.   I thought you might say that, Dombrowsky replied.  People like you will never believe anything.  No amount of evidence will ever convince you.  We have Amparos statement, and more than enough physical evidence to convict, is there anything else youd like to say before we conclude the interview?  Yeah, piss off, Lisa replied.        38   Trial      Call your first witness, the judge said.   The prosecution calls Toby Amparo to the stand, the prosecutor stated.   Toby heard his name and scampered up to the witness box.  The bailiff swore him in and the prosecutor approached.   Mr.  Amparo, may you state your species for the record? the prosecutor asked.   You can call me Toby, nobody calls me Amparo, not even my parole officer.  Im a beaver, Toby replied.   How long have you known the defendant?  Oh, six, eight weeks now? Toby replied.   How would you describe your relationship with the defendant?  We never had sex if thats what youre getting at, oh, no, actually we did once in a shower.   So you were romantically involved? Lovers per se? the prosecutor asked.   No, more like fuck buddies, Toby replied.   Lisa stewed in her chair knowing full and well that Toby was lying and that they were not fuck buddies.   So you didnt have a dating relationship with her.   Are you asking me or telling me? Toby asked.   Asking.   No, we didnt date, not my type, way too bitchy if you ask me.   In you time with her, did you notice a proclivity towards violence? the prosecutor asked.   Oh fuck yeah, this is one hot headed bitch, I had to walk on eggshells around her or get my ass reamed.  Did I tell you about the time she gave me to Madame Jane? Oh, she left me behind, knowing full well that cunt was going to cut off my tail and make stew out of me.   She allowed Madame Jane to kill you? But you are still alive?  Long story, but Im back, and that bitch over there let me die! Toby yelled.  The bailiff stepped in close in case he had to restrain Toby.   Did you ever hear Miss Marie threaten to kill Madame Jane?  Yes, the night she murdered her, she said she wished she was dead, she said nobody puts a tail on her.  Toby replied.   Did you go to her apartment with the intent of killing her?  I didnt, she did, Toby said looking at Lisa.   Did you bring any weapons with you?  No, Lisa didnt have any pockets, she planned on using a kitchen knife.   She told you this?  We discussed it over supper, Toby replied.  She used her steak knife to demonstrate how she was going to stab that bitch, her words not mine, and make her pay.   Did you try to stop her? the prosecutor asked.   I was scared for my life, she had turned into a psycho bitch from hell and I thought shes cut me up next if I didnt do what she said.   So you were an unwitting pawn in her evil scheme?  Yes, unwitting is a good choice of word, Toby replied.   No more questions your honor, the prosecutor said.   The judge spoke up, Defense, your witness, and picked his nose.   The defense lawyer stood up and walked over to Toby shaking his head in disbelief.  Do you expect these fine jurors to believe that crock of shit you just spooned them?  Thats sort of a loaded question dont you think asshole? Toby replied.   Is it true, Mr.  Amparo that you are indeed a rat?  It is true that I am a member of the rodent family, but no, Im not a rat, Im a beaver.   Isnt that just splitting hairs? Beaver, rat, same thing.   No, not the same thing you douche bag, Toby replied.  Do you have a question or are you going to call me names all day?  The defense addressed the court, Your honor, may I have permission to treat this witness as hostile.   Why? You just called him a rat, I think he has the right to defend himself, the judge replied.   But your honor, this thing, this rotten stinking flea infested animal, is going to lie, its in its nature.   The judge replied, My wifes uncle is a squirrel, technically a rodent and has been a fine upstanding citizen all his life.  He has his own dental practice and has never had even a speeding ticket.  I find your gross overgeneralizations appalling.   I hope you didnt take my comments wrong your honor, I consider squirrels to be cute, fun loving creatures that populate our parks and make our lives better, the defense said kissing ass.   Nice save, now get on with something of substance or let this witness go, the judge said.   The defense scratched his chin and thought for a second.  He turned to Toby and asked, Is it not true, that you are in fact, the ring leader and it was your idea to murder Madame Jane because she had killed you once before?  I was pissed, Ill grant you that, but no, it wasnt my idea to kill her, that stupid bitch and her narcissism, couldn't hack having a tail, something that Ive had all my life and wanted to get petty revenge.  I got my life back, I am fine, I may not like that bitch for making stew out of me, but I got my life back, Lisa didnt  She could have had the tail removed, why kill her? the defense asked.   I dont know what goes on in her mind, everyone makes choices, Toby replied.   Once again I ask, why should she kill her?  The prosecution stood and said, Objection, the witness cant speak for the defendant.   Sustained, the judge said.  Next question.   The defense walked back to his table and looked at his notes.  He turned and asked, You say you feared for your life, why not run to the police?  Toby took a second to answer.  The police dont take kindly to rodents, Toby replied.  I didnt think theyd do anything.   I see, then why didnt you just leave?  What do you mean?  Walk away, youre not married to her, you claim you were just fuck buddies.  You could have left at any time.  Does this woman have some sort of strange powers over you?  Stop trying to pin this on me, shes the one with the fingerprints on the knife, not me, Toby said.   Whats to say you didnt plant those prints? the defense asked.   Thats a stretch, Toby replied.   There is a seven minute gap on the video from when you entered the building to when she fell from the second story window.  You had plenty of time to plant evidence.   I had no idea we were being taped, Toby said.   Thats irrelevant, you still had plenty of time to frame my client and then shove her out the window.   You think Im strong enough to pick her up and shove her out the window? She weighs like a hundred and fifty pounds.  Im a foot and a half tall and weigh forty pounds, Toby said.   Let me ask you this, what do beavers do? the defense asked.   Eat and make little beavers? Toby replied.   What else?  I like to play my banjo.   What are beavers known for?  The sixties space program?  No! Building dams! the defense yelled.   Yeah, I suppose, Toby replied.   Beavers cut down trees and make dams out of them, I would think it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say that an animal capable of moving a tree could move a woman.   Using that logic I would have to agree, Toby said.   Good, now why dont you do the court a favor and confess right now so we can get this circus over?  I confess I moved a few trees in my day, that is, Toby said.   The defense shook his head in disgust and went back to his notes.  I have nothing else for this witness, the defense said and Toby took his regular seat.   The judge spoke up again, Prosecution, call your next witness.   The prosecution calls Officer Dustin Ramos to the stand, the prosecutor said.   The court was silent as the uniformed officer took his place in the witness box.   Officer Ramos, what was your duty the night of the murder?  I was on patrol, Ramos replied.   What did you observe when you came to the crime scene?  I saw a woman lying on the sidewalk, and then when I went upstairs I saw Madame Jane sitting in a chair bleeding from a chest wound.   Was she still alive?  Yes, but she was acting strange, like she was in shock or something.   Was there a lot of blood?  Oh yeah, the chair, the carpet, covered in blood, Ramos replied.   Did she say anything to you?  Yeah, she told me to take the knife out.   Did you?  No, it was already out, the rat had it.   Thats all she said?  Well, she did say something else, but I didnt understand what it was, it sounded like she was asking for tail.   Tail?  Usually when someone wants tail, they mean they want to get laid.  I dont think she wanted to get laid then.  But Im sure she was grumbling something about getting tail, or more tail, I cant remember.   Then what happened? the prosecution asked.   She rolled her head to the side and croaked, Ramos replied.   Where was the beaver when this was going on?  He was playing with the knife, Ramos replied.   What? Playing with the knife?  Yeah, when I got there, he was walking in the room with a knife in his hand.   Walking from where?  The staircase leading to the street, Ramos replied.   Did you think it odd that the beaver would have the murder weapon in his hand?  Oh sure, I asked him where he got it.   And what did he say?  He said it fell out the window and he wanted to get it for me.   How often does that happen? the prosecutor asked.   In my career? Never, Ramos replied.   Did you think for a second that the beaver was down on the street planting fingerprint evidence on the murder weapon?  No, didnt cross my mind, Ramos replied.   How long have you been a cop?  Eighteen months, Ramos replied.   Did they teach you anything about crime scene evidence handling at the academy?  Yeah, why? Did I do something wrong? Ramos asked.   I would like to call for a recess you honor, the prosecutor stated.   On what grounds? the judge asked.   I think Im getting sick, the prosecutor replied realizing he might have just sunk his own case with his line of questioning.  Now he had to find a way to dig himself back out of the hole.  But maybe it was too late, things werent looking too good for Toby.  It would be a matter of time before the jury had the case and a decision was handed down.        39   Preacher      Toby sat in a cell on death row.  With what amounted to as a confession on the witness stand, the judge threw out the case against Lisa and Toby was put on trial.  He was quickly found guilty of the first degree murder of Madame Jane.  Today was his execution day and he was meeting with a preacher.   How are you feeling today? the preacher asked.   I feel like shit, what kind of question was that? Toby snapped back.   Sorry, just trying to make conversation.  Have you made peace with your maker?  Ive died before, Im not worried, Toby replied.   I heard about that, you were made into stew and then reborn into the body of a killer?  Yep, thanks for the recap, what do you want?  Im here in case you need comfort the preacher said.   Comfort is two Asian hookers giving me a massage with benefits?  I could possible arrange the message if youd like.   No way, Ive heard of a last meal, but never a last blow job, Toby said.   I could do that for you if you like, the preacher said.  Ive had training.   Toby gagged and wretched.  No thanks, youre not my type.   Just trying to help, the preacher replied.   So now what? Toby asked.  Are you going to feed me some bull from your bible?  No, Im here to make you feel safe on your journey, in case you need someone to talk too.   Well, I do have about three hours, what do you want to talk about? Toby asked.   This is about you my son, not me, what do you want to talk about?  Toby thought hard for a moment.  How do they get girls to do that cheap ass porn stuff? he asked.   What? the preacher asked.   Yeah, you can go to these internet porn sites and see these girls banging themselves on a couch or doing lesbian shit, how do they get them to do that?  I would assume they pay them? the preacher asked.   Yeah I know that, but how do they find these girls? At the grocery store? Toby asked.   Youre asking the wrong person, the preacher said.  I dont look at porn.   Bullshit, everyone looks at porn, hell my grandma looks at porn, Toby said.  And she lives in the woods.   Id rather not discuss this, the preacher said.   You want me to be comfortable, then Im talking porn.   Well, I dont have much to say about that.   Dont you like sex? Toby asked.   Yes, I do have two children.   Dont tell me youve had sex twice.   Of course not, me and my wife have a normal married sex life, the preacher said.   Is she hot?  My wife?  Yeah, what does she look like? Toby asked.   Shes an average looking woman, the preacher replied.   Does she have big tits? Toby asked.   Average I would say.   How about her ass? Toby asked.   Im not discussing my wifes ass with you.   Oh, I see, must be pretty fat, Toby said.   My wife isnt skinny, but shes not fat either, the preacher said.   Does she shave? Toby asked.   She shaves her legs, yes, the preacher replied.   No, I mean her snatch, does she have a bald pussy?  No, she is natural down there.   So you get pubes in your teeth? Toby asked.   What are you implying?  You dont go down on her? Toby asked.   Absolutely not, that is disgusting, the preacher replied.   You were willing to go down on me ten minutes ago, must not be that disgusting.   Its part of my comfort cares, I having training on how to do that, the preacher said.   They teach you how to give blow jobs in preacher school? Toby asked.   Yes, but its not like what you think, we dont think of it as sexual, we think of it as comforting.   Thats fucked up.  They dont teach you to comfort women? Toby asked.   No, not like that, most women dont desire sex like men, women can be comforted emotionally.   So, back to your wife, does she take it in the ass?  I would never do that, you cant make babies that way.   You only have sex to make babies? How dull is that? Toby asked.   Dont try to make it sound like I have sex all the time, we only do it twice a month.   Maybe you only have sex twice a month, but I bet shes getting it on the side.   Why do you say that? the preacher asked.   Women are far hornier than you give them credit for.  I bet she gets laid three times a week, does she work?  Yes.   Where?  She works here at the prison, in the office, the preacher replied.   How often do you see her?  I spend most of my time at the church, I see her when she gets home.   Does she ever get frisky?  No.   Do you?  Yes, on the days we have scheduled for sex.   How does she act on those days?  She does what a good wife is supposed to do.  She undresses, lies on her back and spreads her legs.   Thats it? Toby asked.   Yes, whats wrong with that?  How do you get hard?  This discussion is over! the preacher stated.  Now do you want a blow job or not?  Not, now have you ever found anything that would lead you to think your wife was getting it on the side? Toby asked.   The preacher was silent.   Yep, I knew it, what did you find? Letters? A dildo under her mattress? Sex marks?  She got pregnant! There you go, are you happy? the preacher yelled.   Oh shit, didnt mean to piss you off.   Six times! the preacher yelled again.  Six fucking times! Then she had me pay for her abortions!  Now calm down, I dont want you going all nuts on me, Toby said.   The preacher leaned back and rested his head on the wall.  He closed his eyes and made a fist.  I want to kill that cunt so bad I can taste it.  Tell me what it was like to kill Madame Jane, Ill never know the sweet joy of ending a life.  I think about choking her out and cutting her up almost every day, tell me how that feels?  Feels awesome, try it sometime, Toby said.   No, describe it to me, I need more than awesome.  the preacher said.   I stuck her with a knife, it felt great, Toby said.  I got the bitch back for making me into soup.  I got my sweet revenge.   The girl, why did you toss her out the window? the preacher asked.   I didnt, Madame Jane did trying to defend herself.  She thought Lisa was going to come after her when I pulled the knife.  Once Lisa was on the ground, I stabbed the cunt in the chest.  It was such a rush! Toby said.   I envy you so much, the preacher said.  I wish I had the balls to do that.   Do it, whats the worst they can do? Kill you? Toby said with a smile.   If I get you out, would you do it for me? the preacher asked.   Get me out? Im on death row, Toby said.   I have ways, since Im in the ministry, I have access to people and places no one else does.   What do I get out of it? I get a needle in the arm either way, Toby said.   You get the satisfaction that you helped another man in need.   So you get off free? I dont think Ill get much satisfaction killing a woman I dont even know.   Fine, youll be dead in three hours anyway, the preacher said and stood up.  He called for the guard and waited to be escorted out.  May God have mercy on your soul, the preacher said and he left Toby to himself to stew.       Three hours later Toby was hauled out of his cell by prison guards to be taken to the electric chair, although the chair had been outlawed, there was no veterinarian available to do the lethal injection so an alternative method needed to be found so they dusted off the old chair and hooked it up again.   Toby took the long walk down the dark and foreboding hallway to the execution gallery.  His footsteps echoed off the walls and his shadow cast a hard reflection on the floor.   Hows it feel knowing youre about to die? one of the guards asked.   Well, from my experience, Id say it sucks, Toby replied.   Yeah, I heard about that, youre the amazing retro rabbit.   Im not a rabbit dumb ass, Im a beaver, and I have no idea what you mean by retro?  I know, but it sounded good, the guard replied.   Once in the chamber, Toby was strapped down to the chair and a metal cap was placed on his head.  A prison official stepped in and announced to the spectators, We are here to witness the execution of Toby Amparo, convicted of the murder of Madame Jane.  It is with the full authority of the court and this state that we conduct this execution, by law, on this date.  Is there any last words the condemned would like to say at this time?  Toby shuffled in his seat and thought for a moment, then he said, You know what I cant stand? And I dont know if its just me, but when they put a show on television about rich people, stupid people watch it like they were diabetics eating candy.  I mean, who wants to watch someone driving a better car than you? Or living in a better house?  People are so stupid, it takes very little to entertain them and they will take whatever you spoon feed them.  And whats up with all this celebrity worship? Who gives a flying fuck what these people do on their off time? They take shits just like the rest of us, they all do the same shit, just because they got a lucky break doesnt make them special.   Maybe its a good thing Im leaving this Earth, just to get away from the stupid people who will go to theme park on a Saturday so they can wait in line an hour to go on a ride.  To get away from people who buy t-shirts and coffee mugs with pseudo celebrities faces printed on them.  To get away from people who post what they watch on television on Facebook.  What fucking retards.   Are we mining coal, and polluting our skies with carbon just so you can post your favorite meme on your Facebook page? Is that sort of technology even needed? How did our ancestors survive without a fucking smartphone? Do I need to know that your sister had an abortion or that your cat likes to lick its balls on YouTube? Oh fucking God! Kill me now!  Are you done? the state official asked.   Toby nodded dripping with sweat.   Then the phone rang and the state official picked it up, he nodded a few times and hung it back up.  I just received word from the governor, Toby Amparo has been given a full pardon in the murder of Madame Jane.  Seems she has not been deemed a former enemy of the state and Mr.  Amparo is a hero.  You can release him now, you are a free beaver.        40   Pool man      Two days later Toby showed up at the house he was supposed to be working at, he didnt know if he still had the job cleaning the yard and the pool, but what else was he going to do? Although he was granted a pardon, he was still felt like a felon and didnt think he could land a better job.  Toby rang the doorbell and Lisa answered, she was wearing her uniform, stockings, garter, heels and a head band that looked like something a French maid would wear.   Toby spoke first.  Hi, how you doing?  Lisa was still pissed, You threw me under the buss asshole! You called me a narcissist!  I had my reasons, Toby said.   Yeah, to save your own ass.   You are a narcissist, didnt you want to be a porn model originally? Isnt that what got you into this mess in the first place?  Lisa didnt have a comeback for that so she changed the subject.  What do you want? she asked.   I was wondering if I could have my old job back.   Youll have to speak with Henry or Theresa and they are busy right now.   Busy doing what? Is Henry butt fucking the butler?  No, they are out shopping for new carpet, Lisa replied.   Toby looked at the yard and saw that it was recently mowed.  Whos been doing the yard work?  They have a guy named Maximo that comes in once a week.   Maximo? Sounds like the guy from Gladiator, Toby said.  Is he Greek?  I dont know, all I know is walks around without a shirt on half the time, has five percent body fat, has a ripped body and makes me cream every time I see him.  I can feel my ovaries pulse whenever hes near, its like sex radar.   Sounds like Im out of a job, Toby said.   No, Henry hates him, cant wait to get rid of him.   Why? Wont Maximo let Henry ass fuck him?  Exactly, he tried a few times and it pissed Henry off, these people are loaded and are used to getting what they want.   Does that mean that if I want my job back I have to let Henry butt rape me?  No, Henry isnt into bestiality, youre safe, Lisa replied.   Do you know when theyll be back?  Id say in an hour or so, you want to come in and wait?  Sure, you have any diet soda? Henry asked.   No, they dont drink soda, just cherry punch and wine coolers, Lisa replied.   They still make wine coolers? Toby asked stepping into the house.  What is it again they have you do around here? Toby asked.   I dust, wipe off tables, sometimes make their bed if theyre not around, mostly I sit around and watch television, Lisa replied.   Why do they need you?  Eye candy, Im here to make Theresa happy, rub up against her, and flirt with her, stuff like that.   I thought you were fucking her? Toby asked.   Not anymore, she had a leg removed due to her diabetes and now shes in a wheelchair.  The best she can do now is play with my tits now and then.   Sounds like an awesome job to me, Toby said.   No, it sucks, Im bored all fucking day.  Its like Im working in a nursing home.   Then apply for a different job, Toby said.   I cant, theyre charging me rent now so I dont have enough money to move out, and its there way of trapping me here.   Then a van pulled up to the front, it was Henry and Theresa back from carpet shopping.   I have to help them, Lisa said.  They have a hard time running the lift.  Lisa walked as fast as she could down the steps to the van parked on the street.  She opened the back doors and pressed a button that allowed a metal lift to carry Theresa and her wheelchair to the street.  Toby scurried up next to her.   Theresa took notice and said, Hey, its Toby, the hero of Lancaster, you came back! with a smile.   Toby didnt know how to react.  Uh, thanks, he said.   You hear for your old job back?  Sure, if I can, Toby replied.   Theresa was now clear of the lift and was using her electric wheelchair to speed up the driveway to the ramp that led to a new door they had installed.  Toby kept up pace.   When can you start? Theresa asked.   I can start today, Toby replied.   Good, Henry will be glad, now we can get rid of that Greek.  I want you to get started on the pool right away, its a disaster, I think its getting a green tint to it, disgusting.   Right away Maam, Toby said and scampered off to the back yard where he found something he never thought hed find.  A man lying by the edge of the pool, on his back, looking like he was ready to die.   Toby ran to the man and began cpr, it didnt take long for the man to come around and gain consciousness.  The man sat up and looked around, he seemed dazed and confused, but managed to ask, Wheres Lisa?  To Tobys shock, this man knew Lisa and for some reason, looked vaguely familiar.  Then he put two and two together, this was the man Lisa was with when he found her hiding in the Subway shop in Sparksville.  This is the guy who shot him in the face.  At first anger overcame Toby, then it quickly subsided, He was a monster when that occurred, influenced by the man he overcame.  He was part murderer and part Toby, but now he was back to who he was, he couldnt hold a grudge anymore.   Whats your name? Toby asked.   Judd, my name is Judd, where is Lisa?  Just then Toby heard Lisa yell and turned to see her running in her heels over to the man sitting up next to him.  Judd was still dripping wet, and smelled like the river.   Judd! How did you get here? Lisa asked.   I went back to the farm where they abducted us, I asked around and this beaver told me she saw you dive in the river near a narrow part and disappeared.  I dove in to see if I could find your body and ended up here?  Beaver? What beaver? Toby asked.   She didnt give me her name, but she did have these big loop earrings and wore some really dark blue eye shadow.   Thats my mom, Toby said.   Oh, she was real nice, she offered me some twigs and bark.   Yeah, shes like that, one of those typical corny moms, but I love her, Toby said.   Anyway, I jumped in the river and got sucked into this tube and ended up in that pool.   Yeah, Lisa said.  I made that trip like two or three times.  Youre no longer in Sparksville, this is Lancaster.   Lancaster? Never heard of it, but I had to know what happened to you after that killer abducted you from Subway, whatever happened to him? Judd asked.   Hes sitting next to you, Lisa replied.   Judd looked at Toby and back to Lisa.  No, that guy was like six and two hundred pounds.   Its a long story, but Toby is the guy who took me, hes not the same guy he used to be so dont worry.  Hes all about being a nice beaver now.   Toby spoke up, Yeah, Im sorry about all that, I wasnt myself.   Oh, no problem, sorry about shooting you in the face then, Judd replied.   Look, its all healed up.   Lisa took Judd by the arm and helped him stand.  Lets get you to the house and cleaned up, she said.  She took him by the arm and escorted Judd to the back door and sat him down under the awning on a patio chair.  She ran into the house and grabbed a towel from the bathroom and brought it back out and handed it to Judd.   Thanks, Judd said.  You said you made that trip two or three times? How do you get back to Sparksville? he asked.   Toby spoke up, You have to find a witch and give her a talking beaver to kill, its complicated but trust me, it works.   So I can get back eventually? Judd asked.   Maybe, we got lucky, or should I say I got lucky, Toby kind of got screwed, but if there was a way then, there must be more ways, Lisa said.  But it will take some looking.  In the meantime, we need to get you a place to stay.   Where are you staying? Judd asked.   I live here and work here, so does Toby, Lisa replied.   Do you think theyd let me stay until I figured out how to get back home? How far away is Sparksville from here?  Lancaster and Sparksville dont exist in the same dimension, they are only connected by that tube, I think it may be a wormhole, Lisa said.   So I may never get home?  Maybe not, unless you have a pair of red ruby shoes you can click your heels with, Lisa said trying to lessen the tension.   What if I cant get home? My family, my friends.   I dont know what to say, you just got here, youll find a way, Lisa said.   Now defeated, Judd laid his head back in his chair and closed his eyes.  Now what the fuck have I got myself into? he asked.   Hey, I met a photographer down at the mall, he might need help, and how does that sound? Lisa asked.   How is that going to get me back to my family? Judd asked.   It wont, Im trying to get your mind off this for a while.  Now remember that model shoot you and I were going to do? I think we should do it, just like you promised.   In case you didnt notice, I didnt bring my camera with me, I rarely swim with it, Judd said sardonically.   I can get you a different camera, dont worry about that.  I want to be a famous porn model, and you are the man thats going to make me famous, isnt that exciting? Lisa asked.   Yeah, and we can get abducted again and I can be forced to jerk off into a cup again.   Stop being such an ass, Im trying to help you! Lisa snapped back.   These people you work for, are they normal? Judd asked.   Lisa hesitated, Normal enough, she replied.   Explain, Judd said.   Then Toby spoke up.  The wife is a lesbian diabetic that likes to molest the help and the husband has been butt fucking the butler for over thirty five years.   Is that why you dress like that? Judd asked.   Yeah, Theresa likes the way I look, she pays me to be her eye candy.   At least youre not jerking off into a cup, Judd said.   You will like them, Ill see if you can use the spare room until you can get on your feet, Lisa said.   You might want to go to the sex shop down at the mall and buy a butt plug in case the husband cant find the butler.  Never know when a little protection might come in handy, Lisa said.   Toby spoke up, If you need a butt plug, I can chew one out of a branch for free if you dont mind splinters.   No thanks, I dont need splinters in my asshole, Judd replied.  But thanks for offering.   Do you want something to drink? Lisa asked.   Sure, Judd said.  Whatever you got is fine, I need to get this river water taste out of my mouth.   Alright, Lisa said and opened the patio door to the kitchen to get some cherry punch.  What she saw when she opened the door horrified her and she let out a scream that could be heard throughout the entire house.  Please! Dont kill me! She yelled and slipped on the bloody floor onto her ass.        41   Revenge      What Lisa saw was Henry naked, bending over the kitchen counter with the butler standing behind him with full anal penetration.  The butler was holding a knife sticking in Henrys back, and Henry didnt look happy about it.   Help! Lisa yelled and Toby and Judd ran in the kitchen.   Oh my fucking God! Toby yelled.  The butlers got a knife!  The butler pulled the knife from Henrys back and stabbed him three more times.  When satisfied, he let Henry slide off the counter and fall to the floor.  There, standing naked and bloody, the butler laughed and said, Its about time, that pervert deserved everything he got.   But you were butt fucking him, not the other way around, Toby said.   He made me do that, I detested every second of his sick perversions, for thirty seven years, I either took it in the ass or put mine in his, now Im free.   Why didnt you quit years ago? Toby asked.   I couldnt, he blackmailed me.  Years ago he caught me fucking his wife, and he said he would tell my wife if I didnt let him have his way with me.  My wife died on Monday, he cant hold it over me any longer.   Youve waited thirty seven years for your revenge? Toby asked.  All while working with the woman you fucked? How did your wife not know?  My wife is none of your business, shes dead now, and so is he.   Now what? Toby asked.   Now I kill the bitch, she was in on it too, they paid me fifty dollars a week for thirty seven years, never a raise, never a vacation, and never any sick time.  I had to work the day of my daughters birth and the day of her funeral.  I am going to stick this knife into that bitchs neck and watch her bleed out onto the floor.  Then Im going to stomp on her body like one of those kids bounce houses.  I am finally getting what I deserve!  Then a voice from the opposite side of the room, Not so fast mister! Theresa yelled, she was in the doorway, in her wheelchair holding a fireplace poker.   What are you going to do with that? the butler said with a grin.   Im going to fuck you up butler boy! Theresa yelled.   The butler stepped over to the wheelchair and ripped the poker out of Thereses hand.  He raised it up and smacked her one remaining leg with enough force to tear open her slacks.  There you stupid cunt, take that! the butler said.   What are you? Batman? Who talks like that? Theresa asked.   No, Im not Batman, why do you have to be such a bitch all the time? Ive put up with your shit so long Im ready to explode! Why I ever fucked you thirty seven years ago is beyond me, but then you werent so fat and pathetic back then.   Yeah, well you dont look so great yourself jackass, Theresa replied.   What are you? Twelve? Ive had more grown up conversations with a baboon, the butler said.   You are a baboon, a baboons ass.  Youve been ass fucked so many times you shit every time you walk.  I know, I see your little shits all over the floor all day.  I have to use a doggy pooper scooper just to keep up with you.   That wasnt me that was Henry, Ive worn an adult diaper for ten years now.  Ive been ass reamed so many times by your husband my hemorrhoids are impacted in my colon.   I dont want to hear about your medical issues, Theresa said.  I have enough of my own.   The butler kicked Theresa in her stump and laughed.  You know that diabetic food I was supposed to be making for you? I never made any of it, I actually doubled the sugar just to fuck you up faster.   No wonder my A1c was so high, I thought all this time I was eating healthy!  You were eating as much raw sugar as I could get in you.  I used to put extra sugar in your cherry punch, Id spoon it in your mouth when you were sleeping, and you lost your leg because of me! Got that bitch? Me! the butler yelled.   Theresa pushed the forward button on her power chair and rammed the butler in the shins knocking him to the floor.  That for you, you fucking ass! Teresa yelled.   Toby whispered to Lisa, How come none of us are helping?  This is too good, Lisa replied.  It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.   Yeah, if I only had popcorn, Toby said.   Just then Theresa pushed herself off the wheelchair and thrust her obese body onto the butler who was lying on his back holding his shins in pain.  When Theresa landed on top, he let out a breath as his ribs began to snap like dry kindling.  In a few minutes, he was dead due to lack of oxygen.       Later that day, after the cops showed up, Lisa, Toby and Judd left the house, after stealing a nice camera and headed out to do the photo-shoot that Lisa and Judd planned to do in the first place.  This time they picked a location that was on public ground, but was out of the way so nobody would see what they were doing.  Lisa still planned to get naked and bang herself for the camera.   Where do you want me to stand? Lisa asked.   Toby spoke up, Over by that tree.   Judd didnt like people hijacking his photo shoots and replied, No, sit on the ground in that shady spot, pointing to an open area.   I like the tree better, Toby said.   I like the shade better, Judd said, Im the photographer, this is my shoot, if you want to shoot models, get your own.   You dont have to be such an asshole, Toby said.  Im just trying to help.   Well, if you want to help, shut your hole and stand behind me, I dont want your shadow in the picture.   Pissed, Toby walked around and stood behind Judd.   Ok, Judd said to Lisa.  Spread your legs and let me see what you got.   Lisa spread her legs and showed Judd her freshly shaven clam.  It was a work of art.   Now, use your fingers and spread it apart, I want to see all your girly parts.   Lisa complied and Judd got in close for a tight shot.   Put a finger inside, he said.   Lisa put a finger inside and said, What should I do with my face?  Pretend like youre having an orgasm, Judd replied.   Ok, Lisa said and made a face like she was about to explode.  How is that? she asked.   Very nice, now roll to your right.   Toby spoke up, No, to your left, he said.   Judd looked back at Toby and scowled at him.  Say one more thing and youre out of here!  Toby replied, Ive known her for a long time, she likes it when I help, right? he asked Lisa.   Lisa didnt reply.   See, now leave us alone, go chew on a tree or something, Judd said.   Pissed, Toby walked over to the side of the clearing and sat with his back to a tree.  He folded his arms and stewed.   Judd went back to posing Lisa while Toby watched.  Toby became jealous of the attention Lisa was getting from this man and fondly remembered shooting him in the face repeatedly.  The feeling he had were now starting to simmer and he was not going to let this douche have his way with his girl.  Toby waddled back over to Judd and looked over his shoulder.  That looks like hell, Toby said.   Judd turned around and pointed at Toby, right in the face, One more comment and youre a dead beaver! You got me?  Toby stood up and gave Judd the look that said, Fuck with me, go ahead.   Dont give me that shit, Ill fuck you up, now get the fuck out of here!  Toby looked over at Lisa who was doing a full spread pussy shot.  She was getting annoyed as well.  What kind of photographer are you? You cant set up a shot to save your life, look at your lighting, look at the background, youre nothing but an amateur, Toby said.   Judd set the camera down and stood up.  He was a full three feet taller than Toby who refused to back down.  It was like a classic western standoff, only no one had guns.   Leave, Judd said.   This is public property and youre making porn, Im not going anywhere, Toby replied.   Ill give you till the count of three.   Go for it fuck wad, Toby replied.   One, two. . .   Just then Toby pulled a forty four magnum pistol from under his fur and pointed it at Judds face.  Are you sure about this big boy?  Where did you get that gun? Its almost as big as you?  I have a conceal carry permit, Id show it to you but I left it in my wallet at home, Toby said.   Youre going to shoot me over a photo shoot? Judd asked.   No, you threatened to kick me, nobody threatens me.  How does it feel to be on the opposite side of the gun? Toby asked.   Sucks, Judd replied.   I like that, short and to the point.   Now what? Judd asked.  You need to shit or get off the pot.   Oh, Ill get off the pot alright, Toby said.  Dont you worry about that.   Whats going on? Lisa asked, her finger still planted firmly in her vagina.   Judd spoke up, Looks like your boyfriend here is planning to blow my head off.   Lisa pulled her finger out and stood up.  She walked as close as she dared to the two and said, Toby, now you leave Judd alone, he didnt mean any harm.   Toby kept his eye on Judd, keeping the gun pointed at his head.  Im sure he did, he just didnt expect me to defend myself.  Just because Im small doesnt mean I dont pack a punch.  Now what are you going to do motherfucker? Toby asked.   Lisa spoke up, Put down the gun, Ill cancel the shoot, alright?  I want him to tell me how much of a fuck up he is first, Toby said.   Youre fucking nuts if you think Im bowing down to you, you freaking rat.   Toby smiled, You think calling me a rat bothers me? Ive been called a rat by worse men than you.   For the longest time, all three stood there waiting for someone to make a move.
